1,3,2020-12-22T19:58:08.000Z,nayxwasxhere,I paid for the premium but it‚Äôs saying I didn‚Äôt.,"So I originally got this app with my 1st pregnancy, but I didn‚Äôt pay for the premium because at the time I thought it was bonkers to pay $4.99 for a pregnancy app when all the other pregnancy apps are free. I decided to purchase the app with my current pregnancy back when so found out I was pregnant in August 2020. I KNOW I paid for the app because I would not have been able to use a majority of the features however.... when I decided that I wanted to make a birth plan and use the app to do it, it says I have to purchase the premium for $1.99 which I couldn‚Äôt understand because I paid $4.99 for premium. Every once in a while I‚Äôll have apps that do this so I‚Äôll just tap ‚Äúrestore‚Äù and it restores my purchase and everything is fine. NOT WITH THIS APP. I tapped ‚Äúrestore‚Äù and a message pops up that says ‚ÄúAlert: You have not purchased the app.‚Äù YES I HAVE PURCHASED THE APP. This leads me to think that even though you have to pay $4.99 for the premium, there is also an additional $1.99 charge for the premium that they have snuck in making this app actually $6.98. Phillips what are you doing????",Sorry to hear you are having problems with restoring your purchase.

The overall interface is also very well done- easy to navigate, love that it updates daily. I‚Äôm only giving three stars because the actual info provided is often not very helpful (I don‚Äôt think most people need a full article to tell them pregnancy during sex is safe these days) or a bit off the right timeline (I‚Äôm not quite 14wks and it told me today the baby can now hear me, which is just wrong). The sizes are a bit off because it always shows where you will be at the end of the week, but doesn‚Äôt tell you that‚Äî at 13 weeks, 0 days it will say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre now...‚Äù and give you info that any other source shows for 14 weeks, including your doctor. I overlooked a lot of the faults for the things I do like and kept using, but just found out I‚Äôll get charged to continue in about 2 days, which isn‚Äôt worth the money to me for information that may have small inaccuracies.","Dear cryln8, Thank you so much for your thoughtful feedback.

3,5,2021-06-18T23:11:38.000Z,Seth.D.C,Used for all three pregnancies!,"This is my favorite pregnancy app and I‚Äôve used it for all three of my pregnancies! The articles about how my baby is growing and what‚Äôs happening to my body that specific week is my favorite part and has been very accurate for me personally. When I was 9 weeks pregnant with my third, I started feeling really hormonal and nauseous‚Ä¶I opened up the app and it literally said that this week I might feel more nauseous and hormonal than before! It then went on to share different ways I could help nauseous etc. This type of thing has happened multiple times on this app and I love that! I feel like it knows me haha. It‚Äôs filled with the kind of information I want during pregnancy. It‚Äôs also easy to use. I‚Äôve recommended this app to all my pregnant friendsü•∞","Thank you for your 5-star review - we're pleased to hear you've enjoyed the App's features and content for all three pregnancies.

Out of all the ones i use this is by far my favorite and best one. I love all the features. However at 29 weeks pregnant i can honestly say some of the daily articles are recycled. You read similar articles about things that was already touched earlier in your pregnancy with the app. How many times are you going to tell me about morning sickness, backpains etc.","Thanks for the thoughtful review.

5,1,2017-10-01T02:30:28.000Z,court0109,Wish I could like this,"I really loved this app up until 14 weeks. After that, you have to pay. Listen, I work for a mobile app company so I understand that apps need to make money somehow, but I agree with other reviewers that the developer goes about it the wrong way. I don‚Äôt want to pay for an app that I won‚Äôt be using past my due date. There are plenty of ways to keep your users active past this ‚Äúcut-off‚Äù time of 14 weeks while still being able to monetize. Unobtrusive ads in a free version and an ad-free version is one way. It‚Äôs how so many apps do business these days and users will understand. Just shutting your app off completely to users after 14 weeks unless they pay feels like a crappy way to make money off your users. Especially since this will be a temporary app for so many. This is a crowded app space and there are so many other free apps that offer me the weekly updates I want, so I no longer use this app. I hope the developers reconsider their paid structure one day bc it is truly a wonderful app up until 14 weeks.","The one-off payment we ask protects your privacy and ensures your app won't have lots of ads. And the App can be used for multiple pregnancies. We understand your opinion but free apps may use your data and we respect your privacy. So, after the 14th week of pregnancy, we ask for small one-off payment instead. We hope you understand our position."
6,2,2019-06-01T12:02:46.000Z,mahckes,Poor articles; great images,"The interactive images are beautifully rendered. But like other reviews have noted, the articles are bland, out of date with current medical advice and uninformative. For example, it says to be limit fish to 1-2 times a week and only 1 oily fish, while most OBs are increasingly emphasizing the importance of the omegas in oily fish. Other articles are the typical round up of vapid takes on the usual topics of what to eat and buying clothes and talking to your doctor if you feel down. These could be much more interesting! Also, in an article about possible Down syndrome testing in early pregnancy, they say only that ‚Äúsome women prefer to find out during their pregnancy so they can learn more about the condition and what special care is required.‚Äù It undermines the pain and extreme difficultly women wrestle with as they decide whether to keep a pregnancy with confirmed chromosomal problems. Pretending that doesn‚Äôt exist at all is really weird whitewashing. It‚Äôs not a political issue.","We appreciate your feedback and will share it with our development team. We are currently in the process of updating the content, and your comments certainly help. Thanks to suggestions from customer like you we can continue to improve the App."
7,5,2018-07-09T14:03:07.000Z,ScoobyDooMama,Great app for pregnancy,"Wonderful app for pregnancy and for a few bucks you can use it after the 1st trimester which is totally worth it. They do mention that it DOES cost money to continue after 1st trimester but they do NOT flood you with advertisements so it doesn‚Äôt interrupt ur experience at all. Like some other apps flood you with requests to upgrade. Not so here. Which is a giant plus. This app Has a kick counter included. I love how it reminds me every week when I turn to the next week, also gives helpful articles on what to except etc. the images are in range from 2D to 4D to computer generated animations which are beautiful. Also shows timeline of tests that are done at ur OBGYN s. Included appointment tracker and reminder, so u can easily store the info for scrapbook later. Other features as well.",Thank you for such a lovely review! We're glad you're enjoying the App so much!
8,5,2020-11-22T03:24:38.000Z,Tfzzzzz1128,*Nearly* perfect - can‚Äôt adjust cycle length,"This app is absolutely incredible. It‚Äôs really everything you could need and want in a pregnancy app. Lots of information, planning capabilities, and my most favorite feature - the weekly growth aspect that offers true to size fetal development. My ONLY gripe is that you cannot adjust your menstrual cycle length, so if your periods aren‚Äôt exactly 28 days, the only way to track your pregnancy is through a due date. That‚Äôs certainly not a deal breaker, but when I look at my calendar I would like to be able to see my LMP. I have PCOS and ovulate close to 3 weeks into my cycle, so I would just like to be able to customize my calendar to reflect that.",Thank you so much for your 5-star review. We're delighted you are enjoying the App's features and content. We'll share your suggestion about cycle length with our development team (it's not nitpick at all!).

9,1,2017-10-14T13:38:14.000Z,PittJamie,Be Upfront,"Just like the other reviews, I was pretty surprised to find the app was useless after 14 weeks without paying. There is nothing that tells you or warns you that that's the case. I get all the arguments for charging, and pay for quite a few apps. However, there is no notice that this is going to happen until it just stops working. Surprising your users with the fee does nothing but alienate them. I should have read these reviews before I downloaded. Also, I don't think this app is useful enough, at least for me, to warrant the $4.99 fee. Maybe $1.99, but not $4.99.","We appreciate your comments about pricing. After a free trail, we do ask for a small one-off payment as we don't want to fill your App with lots of advertising.

11,4,2018-03-11T17:40:34.000Z,nothappywithnest,Please consider these?,"I love this app I used it with my first pregnancy. However I feel there should be the option to eliminate the partner info. As well as articles involving partners. Not everyone is blessed enough to have someone by their side. Some people lose their partner and some never have one. I find it a bit depressing, scrolling and having to see the partner stuff every time, being one who no longer has someone to share this with. I think this should be recognized. Also this is my second child and I find most articles are geared more toward first time mothers. It would be nice to choose an option of whether you are a new mom or have had children. That way content could be better filtered.","Thank so much for your feedback - we will share your comments with our development team. In the 'My Account' settings, you should be able to set the App for Single Mother. This should eliminate some (though not all) of the partner sections. Hope this helps!"

Even paid for the update because this app was perfect! Definitely would have given 5 stars... before the update! The #1 reason I loved this app so much was for the images and easy navigation. I downloaded again now and all those beautiful baby images are gone and they have the alien looking graphics like any other app!üò≠ sure it‚Äôs cool because it wiggles when you touch it but definitely not as good as before! Don‚Äôt fix what isn‚Äôt broken! I find this update much much much harder to navigate than before. If they could bring back the lively images instead of the aliens I‚Äôll be one happy camper!

The articles are typically interesting and relatable.  I just spent the $1.99 to purchase the app, figuring I at least owe it to the company for building an app I use regularly and enjoy. My complaint is the kick counter... there needs to be two options to count kicks. Unlike most are taught kicks are not only about how many you get in a certain amount of time, but it‚Äôs more about finding your baby‚Äôs pattern, what time of day you feel kicks and for how long. I now use a second kicks count app that allows me to mark what time of day baby is moving, but would love if it were integrated into this app. After a pregnancy loss at 36 weeks you learn exactly how important movement is.",We appreciate your detailed feedback about the kick counter.

But when I was around 20 weeks the picture on the app did not match how many weeks pregnant I was. Like it would show me my baby at 21 weeks when I am only 20 weeks. And it did that throughout the entire app. I deleted the app and recently downloaded it back now that I am 35 weeks and I still have the same problem. Please fix this! It‚Äôs an amazing app besides this glitch. If this is changed, I will give the app 5 stars.","Thank you for the feedback.

However, I was disappointed to discover this time around that they changed the beautiful images they once had, and the biggest of all, their baby sizing and info is NOT correct. I am getting ultrasounds every 2 weeks since 6 weeks and the sizing is off by a week. They tried to tell me its due to some weird setting and it‚Äôs not - their info is just incorrect. Also, this is insane, baby size jumps from 6 inches at 18 weeks to over 10 inches at 19 weeks?! Absolutely does not match information that‚Äôs out there, nor the actual real life sizing according to my US‚Äôs, which have been lining up with other apps. I am disappointed in this app this time around and have been using others. Seems like they changed drastically from their earlier days - which were better IMO.","In Pregnancy+ until week 18, baby is measured crown to rump. From week 19 on, baby is measured head to toe. This isn't a bug in the App, but is the standard way the a fetus is measured. If your App is set to ""Completed"" weeks this will happen between weeks 18 and 19, and if it is set to ""Current"" week the change will be noted in week 19 to week 20.

It might be great for first time moms but this is my third and we‚Äôre having a home birth so not much really applies to me personally. The only thing I've found that‚Äôs unique to this app is the 3d view.

The information is great and it‚Äôs so nice that it lets you log so many important things such as appointments, your weight and birth plan notes. We would love to recommend it to our friends, but we‚Äôd like one option added. When a man signs up to follow along with the development of his baby, he should have the option of logging in as a spouse and being greeted as a ‚Äúhusband‚Äù not just a ‚Äúpartner‚Äù.

I didn‚Äôt do it though because I had another baby app what to expect when expecting and it‚Äôs free all the way. I do think this app was easier & majority of the time my go to.

I pulled up an article that was suggested for me on that day and it was incredibly triggering to my PTSD. There were no warnings at all and the article presented facts that were honestly written in a way that was anxiety inducing. On top of all this, this app also tells you very little about what is actually going on with your baby compared to other apps where there is a lot more information. They also have some outdated information about chromosomal abnormalities tests. Overall, I liked this app to begin with but I had to delete it because their articles have been triggering anxiety for me more than once now. I wish the app developer would include content warnings before you click on the articles.","Hi there, sorry to hear you feel this way about some of our articles.

I LOVED it UNTIL I purchased the upgrade to get the kicker and contractions!! First off I don‚Äôt do military time and there is no option to change it as far as I can find.

I felt like this app was okay, but from a design/navigation standpoint it's too busy for me.

42,4,2018-10-18T15:18:22.000Z,Casanovasmom,Great app but the twin ultrasounds,This is a wonderful pregnancy app so far. My only issue is not being able to tell what an ultrasound would look like because you have it as a twin ultrasound. The twin ultrasounds are great for those having twins and I hope someday you can have a button to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having multiples‚Äù or just ‚Äúa single baby‚Äù so those who are having more than one can see that their ultrasounds will look similar to the twin ones and that those who are only having one can get a rough idea of what their ultrasound will look like or should look like.

Did you know you can set the App for twins by going to the Pregnancy section of your Profile and tapping the Baby Gender setting? Hope this helps!

And was eager to explore the app after finding out I was having twins! Was extremely disappointed to start off with the fact that they don‚Äôt have a twin pregnancy feature. You can change the gender from boy to girl to twins. But that is it! I kept the app because each week they have a nice little twins/ multiples article. As my pregnancy progresses, I am growing more disappointed as the articles are really more like fun facts about twins rather than information about your twin pregnancy that week. With multiple pregnancies on the rise, you should really do better for other moms!","We're sorry to learn you're so disappointed in the App this time around. Though we do not offer an App specifically for twins, many of the Baby > Weekly entries have information about pregnancy with multiples. In addition, you can change the settings by going to Profile (upper right) > scroll down to the Pregnancy section > Baby sex > Twins. While this will not significantly change the information in the App, it will change the way the App refers to your babies. In addition, this setting will swap out some of the images in the Baby > Images section of the App. For example, 3D scan images for weeks 7,9,10,11 and 13 are of twins/multiples when the app is set to to twin pregnancy.

The week number on the Today page is dynamic based on the settings. In Profile (upper right), scroll down to the Pregnancy section where you can decide if you want to see the 'current' or 'completed' week. The completed week will, for example, show week 5, when you are 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant. The current week will show you week 6, when you are 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant. The 'current week' setting is a bit like your birthday. When you are age 25, you are actually in your 26th year. You can tap the currently set week next to 'Show week' to toggle between the two. It's up to you which display you prefer to see. And the image displayed is the baby during that week. Hope this helps. If you have any other questions or concerns, be sure to let our team know.

The only thing I don't like is how the babies look. I am black and I look nothing like the black baby that's featured (even though she's a cutie.) It's a bit stereotypical. Maybe I'm asking for too much with a slight customization to make me feel like I'm actually looking at my child. Other than that I really like this app. I would pay for it if I could change what my baby looks like.,Thank you for your thoughtful review.

However the black baby hair looks as if the hairs are just bushy. When all babies come out I can say hair texture is the same. I really think that‚Äôs a total disrespect to my race and overall that really sets the tone for horrible app. The moms stomach growth is white. Why no option for people of color there too.

For example in week 7 says your baby is size of a raspberry when every information in the internet says blueberry.","Thank you for your feedback. This difference may be due to the current/completed setting in our App compared to the other sources you are looking at. The week number on the Today page is dynamic based on the settings. In Profile (upper right), scroll down to the Pregnancy section where you can decide if you want to see the 'current' or 'completed' week. The completed week will, for example, show week 5, when you are 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant. The current week will show you week 6, when you are 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant. The 'current week' setting is a bit like your birthday. When you are age 25, you are actually in your 26th year. You can tap the currently set week next to 'Show week' to toggle between the two.

There are many other pregnancy apps that give you weekly updates ALL THE WAY TO THE DUE DATE! This used to be free, why the sudden change?","Our App has always had a free version and a premium upgraded version. The one-off payment we ask protects your privacy and ensures your app won't have lots of ads. We understand your opinion, but free apps may use your data and we respect your privacy. So, after the 14th week of pregnancy, we ask for small one-off payment instead. We hope you understand. If you previously purchased the full app and need help restoring it, please contact our customer service department at support@health-and-parenting.com"

192,2,2017-12-26T07:37:32.000Z,Stephanie5483,Upsetting,"5 stars. Other than, after I got closer to 14 weeks I payed for it to see everything until 40 weeks, I used my email and everything through the purchase, a couple weeks later I got a new phone, before I had a Samsung. I got a IPhone. And it won‚Äôt let me restore purchase üòè don‚Äôt want to have to purchase again. So will be using another app after 2 more days!","Unfortunately, when moving to a new operating system, you do need to purchase the App again. This is because Google and Apple handle sales for us, and they are completely different companies (and purchases aren't transferable between them). Apologies for the inconvenience."
193,2,2019-01-08T12:37:40.000Z,celeste1110,Articles have condescending tone,"Overall the app is fun and has some decent information, especially for first time moms. But many of the articles are written in a condescending and patronizing tone, frequently referencing how ‚Äúhormonal‚Äù pregnant women are, or repeatedly saying ‚Äúpregnancy brain.‚Äù Sure, some women experience some of these symptoms, but not everyone does. What I get from this app is that pregnancy makes you moody and stupid. No thanks.",We appreciate your feedback and will share it with our team.

Then it redirects you to a ‚Äúpay to upgrade‚Äù page. NO THANKS! Wish they‚Äôd just charge 1.99 for the app on the front end instead of forcing you to upgrade at the end if you want to keep all your data all in one place.","We do note that the App contains In App Purchases in our listing. Only a small amount of the App's content is a premium upgrade - much of the App can be used throughout pregnancy for free. We will share your pricing feedback with our team, though.

In Profile (upper right), scroll down to the Pregnancy section where you can decide if you want to see the 'current' or 'completed' week. The completed week will, for example, show week 5, when you are 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant. The current week will show you week 6, when you are 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant. The 'current week' setting is a bit like your birthday. When you are age 25, you are actually in your 26th year. You can tap the currently set week next to 'Show week' to toggle between the two.

The week number on the Today page is dynamic based on the settings.

The 'current week' setting is a bit like your birthday. When you are age 25, you are actually in your 26th year. If you prefer to see the 'completed' week of pregnancy instead, simply move the slider - It's up to you which display you prefer to see.

The week number on the Today page is dynamic based on the settings. In Profile (upper right), scroll down to the Pregnancy section where you can decide if you want to see the 'current' or 'completed' week. The completed week will, for example, show week 5, when you are 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant. The current week will show you week 6, when you are 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant. The 'current week' setting is a bit like your birthday. When you are age 25, you are actually in your 26th year. You can tap the currently set week next to 'Show week' to toggle between the two. It's up to you which display you prefer to see. Hope this helps. If you have any other questions or concerns, be sure to let our team know.

The images show a 2 weeks delay on the development of the fetus. I contacted the support and they gave me two distinct answers. I was so upset. This was my go to app for pregnancy. It is not anymore.,"We apologize for any confusion. Previously some of the images in the early weeks were wrongly dated through embryology, rather than using the traditional LMP dates.

The size of the baby and the weight is really off compared to all the other apps.,"This measurement jump happens because until week 18, baby is measured crown to rump. From week 19 on, baby is measured head to toe. This isn't a bug in the App, but is the standard way the a fetus is measured. If your App is set to ""Completed"" weeks this will happen between weeks 18 and 19, and if it is set to ""Current"" week the change will be noted in week 19 to week 20. In addition, there is a size bug in the App that will be fixed with the next update so that the weights and lengths are aligned in all parts of the App. Hope this information helps improve your experience with the App!"

However, there‚Äôs a very evident push to persuade mothers to breastfeed, with one article even explicitly stating: ‚ÄúBreastfeeding is still the best.‚Äù  This type of explicit pressuring is incredibly insensitive to the mothers for whom breastfeeding isn‚Äôt an option, and disregards very recent research that suggests that, while there may be some genuine medical and emotional benefits to breast feeding, a generous portion of the difference in health and behavioral metrics for breastfed versus formula fed babies are actually due to socioeconomic conditions that would better account for the purported benefits of breastfeeding- socioeconomic factors that were never controlled for in most of the most widely cited articles by breastfeeding advocates. Even as a breastfeeding mother, I find, as do many medical professionals in the field, that taking a hardline stance is irresponsible at best. Mothers deserve a full breadth of education on both choices in order to make their own decisions.",We appreciate your detailed feedback about the breastfeeding content in the App. We will share it with our content development team as they plan for future update.

710,5,2016-06-30T20:39:21.000Z,ValiGurl23,Best overall preggo app!,"Very comprehensive & great overall layout! This was my favorite pregnancy app (used in conjunction with the Baby Center & What to Expect When You're Expecting apps). I liked getting the weekly push notifications for how the baby was progressing & what to expect/do/learn each week. I read the daily info & blogs at my leisure. I really, really like the kick count icon bc it lets you exit the app & go back to continue your kick count. I also liked logging my own stats separately (weight, appts w/my blood pressure & baby's heartbeat count, bump pics, etc.). They have the best breakdown of baby's weekly size, weight, & length & info as well. Overall, I think this app gives the best practical & helpful info in an easy to use & view format. I would recommend using this as the main app & Baby Center app for tips on purchasing baby products & other ""is this normal?"" info (their layout isn't as helpful though & they don't let you save articles each week in a ""to read"" list like Facebook, so you have to remember to go back to it). I already recommended this app to friends. Worth paying the upgrade fee!!",
711,5,2017-06-28T03:58:39.000Z,Apriltastic,The only pregnancy app you will need,"This app offered insightful information from day one of my pregnancy. I found the daily and weekly information to be extremely helpful and surprisingly spot on when I needed it the most.  All of the features offered give you tons of minor and major information throughout your journey including sizes as compared to fruits and veggies, images of the baby at each month, ultrasound examples, and everything in between. The app also made it super easy to find and save baby names that you like from a incorporated database as well as creating your own. You can also make lists to email to yourself that include what you are packing in your hospital bag as well as setting up your birth plan from a variety of options you can select or create yourself. I am actually kind of sad that it's all done. I think I will have to check out their baby app too! I highly recommend this app to anyone new and starting their pregnancy journey, it was well worth the money!!",

721,4,2014-08-10T17:19:26.000Z,Miss Bloo,So helpful on a daily and weekly basis,"I love love love this app. It's always nice to refer to this app for daily information. It really also helps to refer to this app on weekly basis. The only reason why I gave it four stars is because the pictures don't back up from one device to another. Since it's from the same account one would think that the pictures would back up to be able to be loaded onto the whole account instead of the device itself. Otherwise this is a wonderful app it keeps you informed on your babies progress, on your own progress, and gives you weekly and daily information which is vital to one's pregnancy. And it also gives you a list of name choices and even a place for you to put your names that don't exist on their favorite names. I recommend this app for anyone who is pregnant but has or know someone that's pregnant. This app provides a lot of suggestions that are vital for one's pregnancy such as packing a baby bag, packing your hospital bag, Doctors appointments, sonogram pictures, etc.‚Ä¶ Really good app. I really recommend it good work!",
722,5,2014-10-26T21:14:48.000Z,FairHavener,Best all-around pregnancy app,"I love this app. The illustrations are beautiful, and I love the amount of info they give you -- just the right amount of daily and weekly updates. It's great having the weight tracker and appointments in the app (I always record my bp and the baby's heart rate!), as well as the timeline, baby size guide, names section and even hospital bag/birth plan check lists. It's really well organized. There's a kick counter that looks good, too that I will probably start using soon as well (I'm 27 weeks and definitely feeling lots of movement!). I'm a minimalist, so I didn't want to have multiple pregnancy apps and I'm so glad that this is the one I went with. I specifically didn't want one with message boards because they just make me anxious and for me they're not helpful -- if I have questions or concerns I'd rather just ask my doctor or family/friends. This app is completely worth the modest price once you get out of the first trimester and I would definitely recommend it.",

724,5,2015-06-19T14:54:56.000Z,Avragota,Best Pregnancy App,I have been using this app since I found out about my pregnancy. I downloaded multiple apps so I could compare. This app was the best in all. I always open it everyday since I get a new paragraph in the daily blog. O also love going through what other moms had to say. It has many topics I never knew about since I'm a first mom to be. I also love the images they provide because It gives me an idea of how my little one is growing each day. I love all the features because i can see how my body is changing and put in information about my self. My partner also has used the app with me and he was the one that got me to purchase the full version because we could tell it was a very useful app. I would recommend this app to all the new parents like us because it helps us get more inform.,
725,5,2016-02-15T06:29:01.000Z,Nattyrf,The Best Pregnancy App worth the $3.99,"I've been pregnant, now, seven times. I have used many different pregnancy applications both free & paid. I have to say this is the most complete, most advanced, most accurate application. With these other apps I generally know all the weekly pregnancy info they provide having done this a few times & read many books on pregnancy. However with this app I've actually been surprised by some information, which was very cool. The other thing I enjoyed that seems minor but, I was happy with, was when referring to  ""morning sickness"" it said something like ""by now most moms are feeling better but there are a few who still have morning sickness"". I have hyperemesis grevardium & it last for me from about 7-9 weeks all the way to sometimes after I deliver. It's a minor note but it's always a little annoying when books & apps assure me I am ""now over the nausea"" when I know I'm not even half there yet. Paying for this app was a no brainer for me.",
726,5,2016-03-27T18:49:08.000Z,MotoxFreak09,Great for Husbands!,"When my wife surprised me with the wonderful news we were hoping for I was very excited! I also wanted to make sure I was with her every step of the way and one step ahead of her if I could. I got the app and used it free for the first 15 weeks and I decided to buy it. Best couple dollars I have ever spent. Pregnancy plus has helped me understand the day to day changes happening with my wife's body physically as well as emotionally.  Learning the daily development of our child has been amazing and has helped to deepen our bond. Daily tips, suggestions on everything from health, diet and exercise, to helping pick out baby names and advice on setting up the nursery. This app has it all and we are all learning from it. Also gave me lots of ""good husband points"" staying in tune with my wife's needs. Also a lot of fun with the weekly development pictures of the baby. I recommend this app to everyone going through pregnancy. Especially first time moms and dads.",
727,5,2016-04-08T23:06:48.000Z,Chillasf,Best pregnancy app in my opinion .,"So right now I'm about 7 months pregnant and I'm not going to lie I've sorta been jumping from app to app , just to see what I'm comfortable with & when I got this one , I didn't automatically buy the whole thing , I just wanted to try it out & something really weird but cool caught my attention , just yesterday my breast started leaking , and later that night I look at my app and where I see "" daily info """,
728,4,2016-11-24T18:58:35.000Z,Austynnamysmommy,Better than any other pregnancy app,"When I found out I was pregnant which was very early on, I downloaded at least 6 difficulty pregnancy app and this one is by far the best. Everything you need is right where you can see it, you can keep track of everything easily. It's really good. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they have daily blogs on the home page that are usually helpful but other times they were just awful and (had I not already had two kids) some of the stuff they wrote about just promotes fear in pregnant women. These apps need to be more positive. Birth is natural, birth is normal. Keeping a calm, positive attitude is better than reading everyone's horror birth stories. No, I do not want to hear about your emergency or scheduled c-section. Other than those few blogs, it's a good app.",
729,5,2017-05-17T15:31:37.000Z,BabyGarciaDec17,Love !,"Really easy to use! Gives you different type of scans to see what your baby would look like ! Love how it shows your done with one week and shows your what will be happening during the week that you are currently in. Only down side is for Free app only shows baby's development up to 15weeks & you have to Pay $3.99 for the rest of the weeks, but it comes with other incentives as well that you can use to your discretion...i feel this app should offer all 40weeks development for free. I really like this app because it's shows baby more realistically than other apps that use anime/cartoonish babies. Everyone should give it a try ! I think I downloaded about every app in the store I stuck with this one & What To Expect ! Both are great !","Thank you for the 4-star review.

730,5,2013-10-16T12:37:33.000Z,AG2599,Great all-in-one,This app is a great way to sort out all things pregnancy. I liked a lot of the information it gives you on baby's development. I am a registered nurse and it is pretty accurate. I enjoyed tracking my weight but would have liked a normal chart behind the graph.  Sometimes info is oddly oriented towards twins which I am not having but not really a problem. My only real complaint is it does not sink with my iPad and you have to pay twice if you want it on your iPad and iPhone.,
731,5,2014-05-03T10:13:27.000Z,Scnmy00,To Pregnancy App (Health & Parenting Ltd.),"I absolutely loved and enjoyed every week of this app as it guided me with my progress. Very much accurate. Well detailed & expressed. However, I do recommend to the creators of this app to add a feature for those parents or mothers that deliver early, premature baby. As, I myself being one of many early delivering mothers wish I had the option to edit/update within this app to proceed to educate me in those moments when my baby was in the incubator etc. Please look into that & this app is that much closer to being amazing!!!! Regardless, thank you! I will keep my app until we're ready for baby #2. Hopefully by then you will have added that additional detail. Prematurity. Thank You! Best Regards -Yadira",
732,4,2014-07-05T17:35:05.000Z,Trudytoo,Awesome way to try before you buy,"I love this app, I like that I don't have to pay for it until 15 weeks as someone who has suffered a miscarriage before this pregnancy, I would hate to have paid for it and then lost the baby. It's common knowledge that the risk of having a miscarriage goes down after the first trimester so the people complaining about it being a lite version should take that into consideration. My only complaint is that the app tells me I'm 12 weeks 1 day pregnant when I'm actually 12 weeks 2 days pregnant but then it also tells me I have 27 weeks and 5 days left so what happened to the 7th day? Maybe just a bug that needs to be fixed. Overall great app , can't wait to purchase the full version in a couple weeks!",
733,5,2015-01-06T13:40:02.000Z,AnnikaSkywalker,Exactly App I Was Looking For,Very helpful for a first-timer. All the posts seem to fall at the precise time they're most needed.,
734,5,2015-02-24T15:06:54.000Z,KayleighChanel,Perfect,"This app is great for first time moms. My parents and my in-laws live in different states as do all our siblings and family, so this up was very helpful for me as I didn't have people close by to ask questions or get advice. I love discovering the size of baby each week, the weight tracker, and the pictures. So far the app has been on point with info and advice and always seems to come right when I am experiencing it for myself - it's great. The only thing I wish was better was once the second trimester starts the baby pictures are harder to see.. Whether they are blurry or zoomed in, is rather see a full ""picture"" of what the baby might look like at this stage instead of just the hand or up close face.",
735,1,2015-03-26T15:12:54.000Z,Jaxsonsmommy!,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!,"Over all, I like this app BUT it waited until I was 28 weeks pregnant to tell me that the free trial period was up and I had to pay $3.99 for the full version. If I would have known that, I would have done it 28 weeks ago. Now it's like I'm forced to buy it and I won't be using it after the baby comes so why waste $4 for a few more weeks of use? I'm promptly deleting it just on principal. Not fair guys! Some apps I've had on my phone for years and actually get some use out of. Those apps were not even close to $4. This app is just a glorified ticker if you don't have the full app. At 14 weeks it also stops showing you images of the actual size of your baby. It also stops giving you updates on your baby. Your better off downloading ""What to expect when your expecting"" app or ""baby center"" app, which are born FREE! I don't mind paying for apps, but I want to be able to use them, so this one is a waste.",
736,5,2015-07-25T14:57:26.000Z,Koorsmomma4,Love this App!!!!,"Always helpful!! I love reading about the little one in me and the formation is always great with details and explanations. Haven't noticed any problems and I have used this app through two of my four pregnancies. I love it! I love the pictures, the info and the alerts its sends me every weeks updating me on my progress.

737,5,2015-09-15T01:58:05.000Z,cmseibert,Very impressed with 4th pregnancy,"I'm pregnant with my fourth baby I do like what to expect and baby center as well, as those are what I have used in previous pregnancies but I am still learning new things every day. This app has a lot of very useful information as well as interactive tools and fun too. I love watching the slide show of the growing fetus turn into a baby it is very realistic and this app also allows you to track your progress like many other but I will be able to look back at my journey farther down the road and remember the smaller details I will soon forget. It's like an informational journal with interactive tools. I have the pro version and am very pleased with my purchase. The name finder is also fun.",
738,3,2016-03-08T20:36:57.000Z,AlyssaG0929,Great... But not if you miscarry,"I love this app! It's very user friendly and has a ton of info not just on your babies development but it also includes blogs, and facts on everything from where you're at in your current state of pregnancy. My one complaint however, is that I miscarried about three weeks ago. To my surprise there was an option to put you miscarried but I am still getting notifications every week telling me I am ""8 weeks pregnant"" and so on. I know I could just delete the app and call it good but we're trying for another and I'm wanting to use it again. It's kind of like salt to the wound with every week seeing how far along I would have been. I have even restarted the app but I am still getting these notifications every week.  Developers... If you could fix this I would very happily give you 5 stars :)",
739,5,2017-02-03T05:46:41.000Z,Stuckinwideacre,Great app!,"At the beginning of my pregnancy I added a bunch of apps to follow along week to week. This is the only app that I kept...and well worth the small amount of money! It shows you week to week in a detailed description how you your baby should be developing. As and added bonus there is a small daily blog to address experiences you will have, answering questions that you will wonder about along the way! Also included are weekly size charts, contraction monitoring, calendars for your weight and appointments, places to add notes and pictures to track during your pregnancy and more! I really began looking at this on a regular basis and will be purchasing the next app for my babies first year! I highly recommend!",

742,4,2015-03-06T21:02:27.000Z,Anonnycat,Great app,"I was looking for an app that doesn't require you to register with an email address. If I wanted a bunch of crap coming into my inbox I wouldn't buy an app, I'd subscribe to an enewsletter. This one fits the bill and has really awesome graphics. It also doesn't have a ton of useless info and features like some of the others (this is my second pregnancy so I know what info is most important). I show the images to my daughter each week and she loves learning about her growing brother or sister. The only downside is that it's not really free-after you are 14 weeks you have to do the in-app purchase to keep getting new content. Still, I'd rather pay the $4 then use a free app that floods my inbox with emails and offers.",
743,5,2016-02-21T14:27:23.000Z,SabzC,This app is amazing but PLEASE ADD A CALENDAR,"I love this app everything about it is amazing but the only thing I beg the creators to add, is a calendar & with the calendar show you how many months you've completed & how much more you have go, like whatever's completed those days are highlighted or something and whatever if left have like some cute symbol or whatever next to the number, it would make it so much better instead of me having to go to the calendar in my phone. PELASS CONSIDER THIS. I love this app and it's totally worth the money just please consider adding that feature, I know a lot of mothers like myself would appreciate it .",
744,5,2016-07-03T05:11:33.000Z,(:mattemma:),Love It,"This is my second pregnancy and I wanted something different. I didn't have access to apps last time so enjoyed hunting around for a good one. We had the free version for awhile before my husband upgraded it for me. I thought the to do list and shopping list were amusing and fairly handy but since I'm having a home birth, the hospital bag option was useless. It was also confusing at first to figure out how the contraction timer worked. But it was fun overall. My two yr. loves looking at the weekly pictures of the baby and watching the progression video. Biology crash course, right? üòâ",

So I've had this for a little while, and it's such a great app for pregnant women to have. The images of what a 2D, 3D ultrasound would look like at whatever point you're at in your pregnancy, even an animated look which I thought was amazing. It was very informative about what to expect, what symptoms you would be having at the time, etc. BUT, once you get closer to 15 weeks, they start showing you less things unless you pay for it, and by week 15 you can't see ANYTHING. I thought this was extremely unfair! I can't stand apps that force you to pay for it, especially now in this situation where all I wanna do is watch my baby grow and be informed as well as I have been for the passed 10 weeks. Sorry, but 2 stars for this stupidity.",
746,4,2016-11-05T15:10:30.000Z,Juliastarrr93,Upgrade,"This was by far my favorite app to use during the beginning of my pregnancy but once I reached 15 weeks I have to upgrade to be able to see any new weekly information, including the ultrasound pictures they provide each week. I haven't been able to find another app that I like as much as this one and I'm disappointed. This app needs to be completely free. We already have a lot to pay for when the baby gets here, don't make us pay for an app on a phone that we won't keep forever. On the other hand, it isn't too expensive and I was very unhappy with all of the other apps I tried because none of them were as detailed as this one. I love this app and will use it for my next pregnancy as well.",
747,5,2016-11-13T21:01:04.000Z,Erika Elizabeth11,Great app!,"I used this app from 6 weeks and on. I'm a 1st time mom so it was specially exciting for me to read about the changes my baby and I were going through. I like the baby ultrasounds, the fruit/baby size comparison, but my favorite part was the ""partner's advice"". My husband looked forward to resin the weekly updates on baby and I and the partner info really helped him understand what his roll was and how he could be involved and helpful. The descriptions under ""your body"" were 90% accurate and I would find myself laughing because it was exactly what I was going through that week. Thank you!",
748,5,2016-12-29T00:07:51.000Z,ClaudetteG,Excellent app; worth the fee after 14 weeks,"I'm kind of annoyed that people give this app poor reviews because full features are only unlocked for free through week 14.  It tells you that in advance. And don't be cheap people.  I'm about to get pregnant again and my original 2.99 has gone a long long way and now will guide me through a new baby.  The information in this app is beyond tracking weight and weekly bump pictures which I loved) and fetus size updates.  There are helpful guides, time-appropriate short articles and reminders along the way, so it was well worth it for me.",
749,5,2017-02-23T21:28:46.000Z,Ktmarie143,Worth the purchase!!,"I NEVER purchase anything on app's, however this ONE time I did. I couldn't find a pregnancy app that would show me visually along the way how much my baby would change week to week, that's what initially sold me, which is awesome. I love all the other features as well! It tracks ur weight, baby, ur belly photos, size and weight of baby, articles regarding concerns, questions, and things to expect, shows time frames of each month, and waaay more. I'm now in my last month of pregnancy and still very pleased with this app!! Highly recommend the purchase to continue throughout ur entire pregnancy!! Love, love, love it!!!",
750,4,2013-08-31T11:38:23.000Z,Bonzetta,Favorite Preggo App,"This is my favorite app for obtaining information regarding the status of my pregnancy, baby's development, and my body. I love that they make an effort to include the partner as well in the week-by-week discussion. Of all the information I have at my fingertips, I make sure to share the weekly updates from this app with my husband so he can read about and see baby's development. I also love the illustrated anatomical images of the fetus, as well as the user-generated 2D and 3D scans at each week. Lastly, the link to the makers' blog with a rich wealth of information, is a wonderful added bonus.",
751,1,2014-10-27T13:53:36.000Z,Meem Resh Perio,Charged twice and the app still doesn't work!,"First off, the app somehow allows you to make an in-app purchase without creating an account for authorization. After creating the account it doesn't sync any information or remember that you made a purchase, therefore misleading you to purchase it again on another device. Their FAQ  states ""As long as you sign into the same App Store account you used to purchase the Pregnancy App the first time, you will never have to pay twice. Under the ‚ÄòBuy the App‚Äô button there‚Äôs a ‚ÄòRestore your purchase‚Äô link.""",
752,5,2014-11-06T11:08:01.000Z,MrsCochran&baby,This app is a MUST,"If you are looking for an app that you can grow with day by day....this is it. This app is a way to look at your baby week by week and see how it's changing. It also has information that changes daily in a variety of topics, weight tracker, important information for drs apts, blogs to read and discuss things on, and it gives you so much more options. (TOO many to list) the only option I don't like is to continue using the app you have to pay 3.99$ after 15wks. If your further along than that you can't see anything. TOTALY worth it though.....üòç",
753,1,2015-01-01T01:04:28.000Z,DeedeeS5783,Misleading,"This application is decent, I found some information to be different than that which is on other sites. Regardless, when you get up to your second trimester, the require you to pay. I find that to be so misleading and pathetic, because you download these apps unaware of this fact, and then you are used to getting weekly or daily updates, and all of the sudden you feel kind of pressured to update.  Honestly, it's just not a way I would have ran an app. I would have much rather had fans of the app appreciate and appreciate the resources they have been given thus far, and then switch it up. I noticed I'm not the only one who thinks so. Anyone who doesn't agree must have a tendency to waste money or must work for the app. Regardless it's not about the $4 it's about the principal.",
754,5,2015-03-02T12:01:39.000Z,Frustrated MS2,Best Pregnancy App,"I downloaded all of the major pregnancy apps and have been using all of them. Now almost halfway through my pregnancy, I can say without a doubt that this is the best one. The weekly and daily information is great (not all apps have something new for you every day). The weight tracker is the easiest to use of all the apps. Has important functions like contraction counter and kick counter, and some bonuses that are really useful like the baby name list (you can search or add your own), list managers, birth plan, and various guides that provide useful information.",
755,5,2015-08-19T03:41:27.000Z,AliciaLeota,Perfect for following the day by day,"If you like to have something new to read everyday and have an app that organizes your pregnancy, this is for you. You can keep track of your appointments, new baby shopping items to keep track what you have and what you need, and you can even track contractions when you get to that point. You can browse possible names and bookmark them as you are deciding, see images comparable to your baby's growth, and even store pictures of your belly growth to review your timeline over the months. Lots of neat features.",
756,5,2015-08-29T22:26:53.000Z,Tat2QsWife,My favorite pregnancy app!,I downloaded 3 other pregnancy apps before I found this one. This is by far the best one in my opinion. It is easy to navigate and has all the info I was looking for. It includes illustrations as well as actual ultrasound pics weekly plus tells you the average length and weight of your baby week by week. It has the fruit/vegetable comparison which I like as well. Lots of helpful tabs to click with useful information.  You can enter your own info and pics as well.  I deleted all the other apps and just use this one exclusively now.,
757,5,2015-11-04T08:14:17.000Z,EriChani,Excellent App! Best App!,"I absolutely love this pregnancy app. I had three apps & this is my favorite! The images are remarkable because they are very realistic. I love that you can see the development week by week through 2D & 3D images. The week by week information provided was very detailed. All of these things made me feel more connected to my son when he was gestating. I utilized the appointment section, weight tracking, hospital bag check list, birth plan, and name suggestion sections. One of my favorite tools was the kick counter. Even my 6 year old daughter had fun using the kick counter.",
758,5,2017-06-15T19:25:37.000Z,AwesomeMcPhee,I love this app!,"I use this app every single day! Yes, I did pay the $3.99 for the full version. But, seeing as I get on the app every day it seemed like money well spent. I love tracking my weeks & see what my baby looks like each month! I love putting in all my information & love the feature that allows you to upload your sonograms. I can go to one place & see all my babies pictures. Yes, I'm aware I could just look at my phones photo log, but something about it being on this app makes it much more special. I haven't had one issue with the app since I purchased it.",Thanks for the great review - we're working hard to make the best pregnancy app!
759,5,2017-06-28T05:11:47.000Z,Reneejoy24,Love this App,I used this App for all 3 of my pregnancies. It's such a great tool to track baby's growth and development. I found the checklists very helpful (especially for my first) and enjoyed reading the weekly updates about what baby was up to and the changes my body was going through. My toddlers also loved following along with the size chart and would often ask what fruit is the baby now? It was fun to show them pics too of the baby as it would be developing in the uterus. Great App for me and my family enjoyed it too! Highly recommend especially for first time Mums.,
760,5,2014-08-14T06:26:58.000Z,MC_123ABC,Awesome Pregnancy App,"This app is very helpful and interesting, they always have something new to read each day. I really like how it has how many weeks you have left, a description of your growing baby, and how it you lets you keep track of upcoming appointments, etc. This app has so many features it's just an overall awesome pregnancy app. I definitely recommend this one, you won't be disappointed. (It's like 4 something dollars for some reason but that might of included taxes. Its worth it though with all that's included in it and the accuracy of it.)",

Each week my husband and I would look forward to reading about what major change was happening. I loved the section specifically for the       "" partner"" because it really helped for them to know what the pregnant woman was really going through. I loved being able to see the pics of what my developing baby may look like and I also enjoyed the belly growth picture as well. I absolutely recommend this app to any pregnant woman!",
762,5,2014-10-04T18:20:36.000Z,petertogel,Great app!,"Loved using this app throughout my pregnancy. The only issue I had was the descriptions of what is happening with baby often change from using ""he"" or ""she"" to ""it."" My baby is not an ""it.""  Also towards the end weeks the daily blog seems to skip back to earlier topics and even took me to ""week 16"" when I was in the final month. The constant warning messages that pop up during contraction timer usage were annoying. Other than these editing issues I found the app to be very user friendly and include all my needs.",
763,5,2014-11-01T01:02:06.000Z,Kaylawardle,Loved this app!!,"I got this app in week 6 of my pregnancy and it seemed great, so I purchased it before the trial even ran out.. I used it up until the very last day before my baby was born!! It is great. I love the tips and information, the weight tracker, and the name list. I used this app to pack my hospital bags and make sure my nursery was ready for my little one's arrival. From beginning to end, this app was useful for my entire pregnancy. I don't even want to delete it even though I'm not using it anymore. Might just keep it around to look at from time to time. :)",
764,4,2014-12-01T14:28:42.000Z,Anyone else empathize,Great app just missing one thing,"I love this app! It is a great way to keep my family involved in the progress of how the baby is growing and changing each week. My youngest loves the baby size timeline where it compares the baby size to food, while my husband reads all the milestone details. All the tools like doctor appts and baby needs listed are awesome. The one thing I wish this app had was an ability to change the baby's birthday without effecting the due date timeline. We are having a C-section and it would be nice to be able to put that in without messing up the timing of everything that proceeds it",
765,5,2015-04-04T20:16:14.000Z,More than Outrageously Upset,"Used this app the whole pregnancy, worth paying for.","I'm not one who ever pays for apps, so when I saw this was $3.99 I wasn't too thrilled. But I figured I would try it after reading all of the reviews, and I'm so glad I did! By far the most useful, informative, and resourceful pregnancy app out there. I downloaded all of the other competitor apps, and ended up deleting all of them. This app has been my go to app for my whole pregnancy, I look at it multiple times a week (and I'm 39 weeks now!!) Id definitely recommend this to anyone who's pregnant, worth the money for sure.",
766,5,2015-07-12T16:14:00.000Z,MichelleP2015,All the info you need in one app,"Of the 5 apps that I have been using, this is the best by far. Yes, I know 5 apps...overkill haha...just excited to learn everything that's happening in there. Each week the app tells you about the baby, your body, multiples, health tips and there is a section for partners. It was spot on with all my symptoms and questions at each stage. I love the daily articles/topics, the timeline guide, the appointments section, the to do list section...the app has everything you need to get prepared and be organized. I would recommend to everyone.",
767,5,2015-12-10T15:14:00.000Z,AndreaCaresse,My favorite pregnancy app!,This app is my far my favorite. I bought all the little add ons and I love them. The photos in this app are definitely the best of all the apps I've tried. I love that I can see a 2D and 3D ultrasound of what real babies at this stage look like. And the animated graphic for each week is beautiful and happy.  And the weekly updates are great! There's so many features on it that I can get all the info I want in one place which is great. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone looking for the perfect pregnancy companion! By far the best one out there.,

I wanted to find a app that can help her threw her pregnancy and keep track of everything she goes threw and we both love this app so much there's things that it teaches you that I never knew with having my five kids it's one amazing app that is for sure. We both love reading the blogs and all the information that it gives us about the size of the baby and all that, we recommend it to everyone we know who becomes pregnant it is so worth it for sure..",
769,5,2017-03-07T02:27:25.000Z,Ô∏èBlan,Love it,The app is great. I look forward to reading about what is happening inside of me during a particular week. I think it's very informative. I especially love seeing the pics of the side view of a pregnant woman and seeing how big the baby should be inside of your belly that month. I sometimes jump ahead to see what I have to look forward to. :) I did catch a typo on today's info though,

I then when to the doctor a week later and they told me I was 5 weeks pregnant just like the app told me. I also love it show and gives detail about what's going on with me and my baby. Not saying that you shouldn't go to the doctor because that is key but this app tells you the very same thing your doctor would. I highly recommend this app to any women who is expecting. I loveeee ittt... üòç,

I love the daily tidbits and the weekly updates are very detailed. There's a lot of extra features with this app. This is my 2nd pregnancy and I read several books with the first, and I enjoy reading a out health and our bodies so I found this one to be accurate and up to date. I would highly recommend this app!!! Worth the money!!!!",
772,3,2014-12-28T12:26:29.000Z,Schoffend,Could be better,"First off, I find it annoying that they want a weekly check in for weight. Second, the pictures have been trimmed since last update, so bottom of weekly pics are simply cut off. Another thing I noticed, is that the pictures seem to be in disorder, especially in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. For example, week 29 you have what seems to be a developed baby, then the pictures for week 30 and 31 are of an under developed baby. Then all of a sudden, go to the next week (32), and you have a plump baby. Week 34 and 35 also seems out of place. Week 27 is a terrible picture where you don't see the head at all.",
773,5,2014-12-30T18:43:00.000Z,New Mommy & Fiance,Best one out there,I downloaded 2 or 3 other pregnancy apps 2 of which are really popular out there and I ended up deleting them and keeping this one.

774,5,2015-02-04T10:48:33.000Z,Jadexica,Awesome App,"I love this app, it's better than most I've tried and bought. Love the pictures. After multiple miscarriages, ectopic pregnancy where I lost a tube, 2 failed fertility cycles my husband and I decided to adopt. 3 weeks after our sons adoption we got pregnant on our own. I am almost 11 weeks (longest pregnancy we've ever had) and everything is going on target per not only my OB but this app as well so I can see the point of the app being free until 13 weeks. You just never know what can happen. I plan on buying this app then.",

I rummaged through all of them and deleted all of them but this one. I keep up-to-date with how far along I am and I look forward to different articles it reveals to me each day. I write all the questions i have and bring my ipad with me to each doctors appointment. I find it extremely useful and worth the small amount of money it costs to access everything it has to offer. :)",
776,5,2015-04-22T17:53:36.000Z,JO Minton,Mama of 2 & one on the way,I love this app. It's so amazing how it tells you so much about your beautiful blessing growing  in side your belly. And it gives you great tips on how to take good care of you & baby. If I have another baby after this one I would use this app again. I've even recommended this to my sis who is also pregnant. She's  just 2 weeks apart from me. It's also nice to be able to show my daughter & nieces what the baby looks like & the size the baby is. I recommend this app to any one who is expecting.,

It's hard to find good information and apps that give good insight to a pregnancy like this app. But I'm not paying to ""unlock all features"". I'll just google or find another app. I understand a person/company needs to make money for their hard work and what not but I'm just not feeling the vibe that I get when I think of paying an app to help me better understand my own pregnancy and get peace of mind. But again, it's a great app information wise.",

780,5,2013-09-24T12:12:09.000Z,RachaelHime,Enjoyed weekly progress report,The primary reason I purchased this app was to see pictures and read about my baby's development. It certainly has delivered on that objective. It's fun to read about what's next. It's also easier to hand this app over to my husband (versus a book) when he's curious. Possibly would have been more inclined to use other features if I had downloaded app at beginning of my pregnancy. Definitely would recommend this app to other expectant moms.,

My husband and I have lost several pregnancies, I appreciated that we didn't have to pay until past 14 weeks. It's a small thing, but it gave me something to look forward to being able to purchase the full version. I would recommend this to any new or veteran parents!",

I could even add my own belly pic which it's awesome! Love how it keeps me on track n I can rely on it to record important details and reminder and even my pregnancy journal! It's super!

I'm currently 32 weeks and I love that it tells me something new everyday because it seems that everything in the blogs is what I've been experiencing so great to read what they have to say and it also shows me what our baby is compared to which is great for parents with older kids as well so they can see and feel like they're a part of the pregnancy as well. I would recommend this app to anybody pregnant. (:,

I even tried resetting my password and it still told me my email didn't exist with an account. Being that I just found out I'm pregnant, I just created a new account. Hopefully, it works now.",

By far the best pregnancy app. It gives the option to reset it for when you have another one, but I don't even want to lol. This will be my first baby & she means to world to me. Thank you for this great app.",
789,4,2017-05-19T15:28:11.000Z,Beirdneauk,Wish it were free!,Some of the baby pictures they have are duplicates.

Feedback from customers like you helps us to keep improving the App!
790,3,2013-02-20T20:11:53.000Z,widgetores,"Great graphics, okay information","This app has the most life-like graphic interpretations of a growing fetus, which is great. It also has a lot of interesting tools. The information, however, is a little biased and unreasearched. For instance, there is no actual proof that what you eat changes the flavor of your amniotic fluid, so don't tell me that my baby will ""taste"" everything I eat. Also, don't tell me that I should ""expect interventions during labor, such as pitocin or a C-section."" Interventions can be almost always be avoided, so I don't appreciate an app telling me that I should expect these changes to my birth plan.",

I'm 5weeks 6 days and from the beginning of week 5 it's been giving me week 6 updates and so on but other then that I'm very happy with it!,

I always keep my appointments in there and keep track of my weight at every appointment. I would recommend this app to every pregnant woman!! It really teaches you a lot.. Who cares if you have to pay $3.99 after 14 weeks pregnant. I'm 14 weeks and 4 days now and I'm deff going to purchase it right away.. It's way way worth the $3.99.. Best $3.99 I've EVER spent:),

Other helpful features: timeline of events throughout your pregnancy (ultrasounds, first kicks, tests), helps you track appts and weight progress. Overall I've enjoyed this app. You do have to play around w it at first to fully understand its features as it's not as intuitive as I would like but after that it's great.",

As a first time mom-to-be, I love being able to see weekly pictures of fetal development, getting daily updates related to prenatal health and having the ability to track all things baby in one convenient place. The ability to add photos, count kicks, track weight and add doctors appointments is a great addition and adds a personal touch to this app. It's a one-stop-shop for mommies!",

I began using this right from the beginning. Yes, you will have to pay for this down the road but it is truly helpful and educational. It is totally worth the $3.99. The weekly articles are the best and was looking forward to reading the updates every Monday morning. I highly recommend this app!",

It has everything in one so I don't need 4 different apps. This is our second pregnancy using this app. I also love that they considered Multiples (we had twins first pregnancy; single this pregnancy), Partners info which i send straight over to my husband to read, and what to pack for Hospital. Used the contraction timer during labor. Excellent all the way. Highly recommend it!",

I have three small boys who love to see pictures of how the baby looks each week and also a fruit comparison for how big the baby is. It tells you what tests you will be doing at the doctor on a time line and info on the baby and things for mom to expect as well. It even tells the babies horoscope for birth. Every day it up dates with tips and how far along you are.,

The pregnancy books are so mind numbingly tedious, and your OB usually has you in and out of your appointments in 5 minutes or less, it's great having this app to fall back on for information, and I love the new design! So cute!! üíû",
802,5,2014-05-26T14:13:13.000Z,Riguytofly,"Lots of features, wish I could turn some off.","This app has a ton of cool features and is very informative. You will find the occasional grammatical error but for the most part it is very refined. My issue with the app is there is a lot of focus on weight gain and there is a feature that includes showing a practically nude model for tummy sizing. It would be nice to be able to turn features off, as these ones in my case would upset my wife.",

It's been fun to share with my other two children the size the baby is that week, compared to fruits we have in the house. It gives them something to compare the baby's size to. I find the appointment calendar so convenient too. Wish I had this app for my previous two pregnancies as well.",

This app is the only one that I liked and was easy to understand! We enjoy finding out our baby's milestones every week and it helps with a lot of questions so I am not blowing up my doctors phone! I highly recommend this app and I will definitely use it again in future pregnancies.,

They help you with your birth plan and what you'll need to prepare for the baby and its nursery. They show you what you actually need instead of what people get extra that just make stores money. It makes me even more excited for my baby to get here and it satisfies my need to plan ahead!",

Totally worth the money after the first trimester! #1 best thing about the app is that many of us wonder what baby looks like! Every week this app shows what baby would look like on ultrasound and on 3D or 4D! I also like being able to record my belly size every month and the scale chart for weight as well as daily updates and not just weekly ones! Thank you!!,

809,5,2017-04-12T14:57:39.000Z,KodakDad,Expecting Dads,This app is simply amazing. Not only has this informed me more about the cycle of pregnancy and it has let me experience following week by week the approximate growth of my child. ( ex.

My husband and I started every Sunday by reading our weekly update. The daily reminders were timed perfectly, and the related blog entries were helpful also. We used all of the features on the app - names, hospital packing list, kick counter, contraction timer, dr appts, weight tracker, and others! It was worth every penny!",

I love the fact that it shows me what my baby looks like in the womb, I only wish the photo that they use wasn't so zoomed in. As I get further a long the picture gets bigger. I would like it better if I got to see the whole baby not just the face. Other than that, this app is amazing!!!",

It's simple to use, uncluttered, and the animations of baby are incredible! I also love that there are actual sonogram photos week by week. I love the daily/weekly info and the option for journaling. Didn't think I'd use that part, but some days, ya just need a place to write down symptoms or feelings or cravings. Must have for all soon-to-be mamas!",
813,5,2014-07-23T04:46:24.000Z,Rainbowoblivion,Worth the money,I rarely purchase the upgraded version of apps but I made an exception for this one. This app is way more user friendly than a lot of the other pregnancy apps and it had some cool features like sonogram pictures and drawings.,

However, every time is says it will restore the app it doesn't and that I need to purchase the app. Then I try and re-purchase the app and it tells me that it's already been purchased and it will restore for free? Soooo, glitch? I would either like my money back or to have the app work!",

However this one is just so much ""cleaner"" in its look and usability. The classy version of tracking your pregnancy. I love the weight tracker and the list builders. Also, the feature to write your birth plan makes it so easy by just ticking boxes, and it's so easy for others to read. Just simple bullets. No wordy paragraphs that annoy medical professionals anyway.",

All of this weekly and daily info, tips, incredible images, and more at the palm of my hand must have took someone a whole lot of time and effort to create. After all, would you work for boss for free? I didn't think so, because your time matters as much as the makers behind this app does.

Then at my 14 week mark little padlock icons started showing up blocking the screen with ""if you want to continue, please pay to unlock the rest of the app!"" By week 15 the entire app (except the home page) is locked unless you pay. In order for sites to demand that you pay they've got to be pretty darn good, this is not one of them that is worth paying for. Deleted it, go with Ovia, whole thing is free.",

I installed it at our first positive test at a mere 9 days past ovulation. The information the app contains is above and beyond the typical pregnancy app. The images are stunning! Also, easy-to-use layout and so very user-friendly. Even my grandmother could use this app if she chose too. I love it. Thanks so much for an awesome app!",
853,5,2014-11-03T21:51:13.000Z,ThankYouSirCanIHaveAnother,Beautiful and Informative!,Love love loved this app! It was such a helpful little app with all its beautiful pictures and helpful information. It's like this app could read my mind and would send daily advice and would always seem to answer things I wondered about in the back of my mind! I highly recommend this app to anyone that's expecting a new little blessing in their life.,

It has everything from daily counter, to weekly growth updates, blogs and so much more! It has been such a handy go to for pregnancy! I love opening it each day and reading the new articles it has! Must download this ap if you are expecting!",

The layout is nice & I like how I'm able to see what the baby looks like throughout the weeks. Our 3 kids always ask ""what size is the baby now?!"" And they too look forward to pressing ""play"" to see how far the baby has come in size. The tips are always very helpful as well! Thank you!",
856,5,2015-12-25T12:40:59.000Z,Baby Eden Mama,Perfect for first babies!,This app is extremely useful and has tons of information that I as a new mom found reassuring. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed reading the daily updates and reviewing the tips and pieces of educational information.,

The pictures are so real you can see how big your baby is......personally i dont like those cartoons pictures i like this ones because i feel like its the real deal!. I love reading how my baby is growing every week and they have great daily blog about what you should do and how to stay healthy i recomend this one!! It really helps you out a lot!,
858,2,2016-09-06T18:46:28.000Z,NotToopleased33,Good until 15 weeks,"The app was great until I hit 15 weeks. It's advertised as free but after 14 weeks, the app requires you to upgrade/pay for any further info. It's easy to say ""just pay the $4"" which I would've done if it had cost that from the beginning but holding any further information over your head 'for a small fee' is pretty obnoxious. Luckily there's plenty of other app's that are actually free, you just have to take the time to download them. Wish I'd read the reviews more thoroughly in the beginning.",
859,5,2017-06-16T14:08:43.000Z,Goldfish1004,Love this app!,This app is visually appealing and everything is easy to locate and read.  I check it several times a week and my 6 year old daughter does too!  She loves seeing how big her little brother is and measuring his size in her hands.  It's a neat app.  I opted to purchase the extension for a few bucks so I can access the weeks beyond 15.  I think it was worth it. *2 thumbs up!*,How fun to share it with your daughter! It‚Äôs really nice to receive such lovely feedback.  Thank you so much! We‚Äôre working hard to make the best pregnancy App!

It only goes through the first 13 weeks of pregnancy but it is still very insightful and I'll definitely be purchasing the upgrade to get me through the rest of my pregnancy! I love all the tools, photos, and daily tips! Great app!!",
861,5,2014-04-05T15:54:06.000Z,wiseinokc,Love it!!!!!,"I had picked a few pregnancy tracker apps and used them for about two weeks. This app stood out amongst all of them. It's beautifully crafted, easy to use, and has many ways to keep track of your pregnancy. It offers many guides on various things such as exercizes, foods to eat and other ides for pregnancy. I highly recommend this app for new moms such as myself.",
862,5,2014-08-12T14:04:13.000Z,Runner3773,Best Pregnancy App,I downloaded several pregnancy apps but now that I'm in my second trimester this is the only one I'm still using. This is the only one that shows me the actual week I'm in. Great description what happens with baby and my body. Loved the size charts with fruit or vegetable. I'm only missing links to videos about babies development and marks on the timeline for 2nd and 3rd trimester.,

864,5,2014-10-22T21:59:34.000Z,June$,The best!,I loved having this app with me throughout my nine month journey. I love the information that was shared and the ways to keep track of my progress and appts. I wish there was an enhancement so I could enter my baby's birthday and we could continue tracking milestones through this next part of my journey. Thank you for being apart of such an important part of my life.,
865,2,2015-07-02T13:37:43.000Z,Lysh C,Disappointed!,"I was really enjoying this app, very informative, the daily blog is great, imagining is really fun. However, it's been 8 days and my daily blog won't update. It tells me the current title of the blog, tells me my current weeks and days, the size is correct, but when I click on the blog it goes back to day 98 (which I am no longer there) same with my weekly description, I want to read about my current week, but when I click on it, it goes back to 14weeks, and prompts me to ""upgrade"" kind of disappointing!",
866,5,2015-08-30T23:20:08.000Z,Yourasandbag,Best pregnancy app I've had!,This app is seriously amazing! Totally worth the very few dollars. I am so glad I got it personally! I got it when I was 8 weeks and now I am 31 weeks! It's very helpful and does have amazing advice. I'm so grateful for it. This is coming for a FTM that hasn't doesn't enjoy apps that involve reading. I actually look forward to reading the next day and week!,
867,5,2016-06-08T21:55:28.000Z,Jamiet563,Great app,"I'm enjoying this app more than some of the others. The little timeline is slightly outdated. Gender can be determined as early as 10 or 11 weeks now and Doppler heartbeat can be found much earlier than the timeline states. I thought it was odd that the info hadn't been updated yet. Also, some other tests that aren't included on the timeline or they just aren't placed accurately.",
868,5,2017-02-14T18:07:21.000Z,CoCoCaptures,Just as Great the 2nd time Around!,"We used your app with our 1st, and now we are 2 weeks away with our 2nd üôåüèº I absolutely love this app and recommend it to my friends and patients. My sister has used and loved it as well. (We're due a week apart!!) Very easy to navigate. Informative without being 'pushy' on controversial topics. And I love the weight graph, and weekly size chart.",
869,5,2017-05-24T19:17:07.000Z,Fran CIA,Needs to be twin pregnancy friendly,I love this app. It's really great. But it needs to be twin pregnancy friendly (or multiple). People are having twins or multiple babies lately it's only right that we embrace them too.,"Wow - twins! How exciting. Many of the Daily and Weekly entries in the Baby section of the App have information for mothers of multiples. In addition, you can set the App to recognize that you're having twins in your Pregnancy & Due date settings. Hope this helps! We appreciate your feedback, though!"
870,3,2013-06-12T06:01:24.000Z,Julie Clark,Fun at first,"Kept me busy at first but went through the info pretty quick.  Planning tools (appointment scheduler and weight tracker etc) were handy though.  Overall, most of these apps are pretty redundant, filled with mostly generic ""official"" recommendations that I learned in high school biology.  I'm a microbiologist and physician assistant and so I suppose I am looking for something that digs a little deeper into the less obvious, and even addresses the controversial issues and science of what makes for the healthiest pregnancy.",
871,2,2014-02-27T02:49:59.000Z,Idontwanttosignin123,Liked the app until the update,"I BOUGHT this app because it didn't make me sign up or sign in with social media and now it asks me to do this EVERYTIME I launch the app. I paid for this and should be able to permanently decline this if I don't care about data synchronization.  Also, I used to be able to put in a weight with partial pounds and now it seems you can only do full pounds so that is not really an improvement. Please get rid of the sign in page. I like the content but I liked the app so much more before the update.",

I loved the timeline and all the features which I felt were laid out lovely.  The only problem is that it won't stop asking me to restore after every other click.  I have tried restoring several times checked to see if I have the updated version and etc. I would delay buying this till the bugs are fixed.",
875,5,2014-10-08T02:52:39.000Z,Fhfsrgi357,Beautiful and organized,"So many features with this app, yet it is not overwhelming because everything is so well organized. Not to mention the animation is beautiful. After downloading several pregnancy apps, I deleted all but this one. And unlike other free apps with a ""+"" edition, I don't feel like this app is incomplete unless I buy the other version.",
876,5,2015-07-27T19:37:16.000Z,Eatmeimgrimey,Amazing!,"I downloaded this app the moment I found out I was pregnant ! And honestly it is the best app!! I love the design and how it gives you so much information about the baby, how you may be feeling at a certain point, and also information for your spouse. It shows pictures of how your baby is growing week by week! I am absolutely in love! Best pregnancy app!",
877,4,2015-08-28T13:41:32.000Z,NugeTwenty2,Please make this tiny change!!!,"This app is amazing! I love it! I REALLY wish it would let you customize the lists: hospital bag, birth plan etc. It allows you to add your own but you can't delete anything, even the ones you add yourself. I would prefer to have the list exactly how I want it then check off the things once they are packed. That little change and I would give the app 5 stars for sure!",
878,5,2015-12-18T16:45:51.000Z,Dixiebabe69,Best baby app out there,"This happens to be the best baby app available. I am on my third child and the day by day things to help me get to know what's going is just fantastic. There is a lot I didn't know about pregnancy. Week by week is awesome as well, so if your pregnant or trying to be come pregnant I highly recommend this app. I don't know what I would do with out it.",

I loved seeing the pictures and learning new things that were occurring that week. The contraction counter kept me from making unnecessary trips to the dr for false alarms. Highly recommend for everyone, whether its your first or your 10th!",
882,5,2014-06-19T20:22:05.000Z,Smoooooooth,üíóüçºüëº love this!,"Amazing app. My sister is actually the pregnant one, but I wanted to follow along with her pregnancy because we currently live across the country from one another. This app allows you to customize the settings to choose if you are the mom, grandmother, aunt, etc!! It's awesome! It is full of useful information! The pictures are adorable.  Definitely worth downloading.",
883,5,2015-09-11T20:33:19.000Z,CindyPatricia,Great app for pregnant women,It really gives you important information you need to know about your pregnancy. Especially if it's your first time being pregnant like I was. I related to a lot of the blogs they posted and it gave me a lot of answers to questions that I had about pregnancy. Definitely recommend to other mommies who are welcoming a baby to the world.,
884,5,2016-01-20T16:50:09.000Z,Fubar...,Perfect App for new moms,"This app has been extremely helpful.  Very worth paying for the upgrade. The daily info is great but the weekly information has been perfect, explains a lot of what is going on with your baby and your body. It has been great with keeping up with Dr. Appts, tracking weight, blood pressure, baby's heartbeat, etc. I highly recommend this app.",
885,3,2016-02-04T06:27:51.000Z,CO Fisherman,Not worth $3.99,This is my second pregnancy and I decided to go with this ap this time because of the simplicity and the pictures. I enjoyed it but did not feel it was worth having to pay after you get to week 14 when there are other apps that will take you through your whole pregnancy with as much or more information and the same amount of features. Bummed because it was great until week 15.,
886,4,2016-03-31T16:27:19.000Z,Kiss_My_Septum,Only first trimester,"I don't like how to see the 2nd and 3rd trimester you HAVE to pay $4. The first trimester is good to know about but once you get into the kicks and the all the time movement and not being able to hold your pee because the baby is pushing on your bladder women should be allowed that information too without having to pay for it here, we can get it free on the Internet, it's good for the first trimester.",
887,5,2016-05-30T02:59:16.000Z,Pookie's Wifey,Perfect App for Mom of Twins!!,"My husband and I found this app exceptionally helpful. From the pictures, to the detailed info on the babies to tracking my weight to doctors appointments... This app did it all.  Week by week this app literally guided us through the entire pregnancy. This was the ONLY app that I found that provided info for mothers carrying more than one baby.",
888,5,2017-02-15T19:56:02.000Z,spidenola,Great for siblings,"Got the app for tracking but paid for the full version for all the pictures. It was so fun to show my 3yo pictures of ""our baby"" before it was born. Helped her to get through the mystic part of baby growing inside and she asked to see pictures of the baby often when we talked about her new brother or sister.",
889,5,2017-07-27T10:24:07.000Z,NOT FREE! ALL BULLS***,LOVE IT,I have checked this app every week since becoming pregnant.  I knew when I was 4 weeks pregnant and I am now 37 weeks.  I enjoyed watching my baby grow on the screen every week and the articles were all very informative.  I downloaded a bunch of pregnancy apps this pregnancy have deleted all of them except this one.  Highly recommended!,It‚Äôs lovely to read your positive review - we're glad you are finding the App useful!
890,2,2013-04-07T14:23:49.000Z,Ewaka,Inaccurate :(,"I am in 2nd trimester, so after comparing all the apps, I decided to buy this one. I went inside trial version to buy it and instead of updating, I had to enter everything over again. Then it changed my due date even though the LMP was the same. Not only that, the date on the trial version changed and the two versions don't even match even though they both have the same LMP. I'm so mad that I picked the one app to pay for that cares nothing about accurate information. Fix it, please!",

Great app",
893,5,2014-09-10T04:39:20.000Z,FacerCubed,The best pregnancy app,I have learned so many amazing facts about pregnancy and child birth because of this excellent app. Also it's the only one that allows the parent to enter whether they are the mother or father. Full stars because of this feature. The pictures are incredibly detailed. I recommend purchasing this app for there are so many extras beyond the free version.,
894,5,2014-10-31T10:42:50.000Z,mommmaMorgan11,Wonderful App!!,I have really enjoyed using this app ever since I first found out I was pregnant. I love showing my DD pictures of the baby on here and it has helped her understand a little more about what's going on with momma! I really love it now that the update has made it so the blog is more appropriate for where I'm at in my pregnancy and enjoy using it everyday!,
895,5,2014-11-05T16:29:35.000Z,Jillio31,I love this app!,Not only is this app informative about the baby's growth and your stage of pregnancy but it also offers a lot more. Everyday there is a new blog posted about things every pregnant lady wants to know. Also everyday there is a little tip of the day to help you have a safe and healthy pregnancy. I highly recommend this app to any pregnancy woman not just first time moms!,
896,1,2014-12-03T18:47:48.000Z,MomoftheSouth,Don't get too attached to this app...,"I loved this app, and so did my family. We shared and updated with it. And then on day 99 (when my first trimester ended), the app quit letting me read info. Now I have to pay $4 for the full version. They tease you with the first trimester info, and then expect you to pay for stuff that was free the day before. Too many free and useful tools online and available through my OB for me to pay for an app that preys on the excitement of new moms. Shame on you for misleading and taking advantage of people who want information about their growing babies.",
897,5,2015-01-12T11:57:07.000Z,Guy on the bottom,Expecting father,"Has tons of info each week! I really enjoy reading the new info each day and better understanding what is happening and how things are progressing. It's funny because there will be times my wife will say, wow I really feel like my belly grew over night and sure enough there will be a post about exactly that!",
898,1,2015-04-14T17:04:24.000Z,Naomianselmo,Paid for features I didn't get,"I paid for the full app because it said it would let me see info past 28 or so weeks, but it also promised tons of extra features. Paid for the full app, and didn't get one single extra feature. Rip off. Plus, it's pretty dumb that you have to choose baby names from their very limited list. You can't add your own to keep track of names you're actually thinking of using. Finally, half the daily blog posts are full of misinformation and are written not by healthcare professionals, but by first-time moms.",

This app is great to have during pregnancy!",
900,5,2013-06-09T01:38:39.000Z,cute - could be tweaked,Very Nice,"This is a good pregnancy app. It has a lot of helpful tips, information, and I LOVE the internal images of the growing baby. The size guide is fun to share with hubby (""Baby is the size of an avocado this week!"") and I like the email function of weekly updates too. Only complaint is that you have to pay to continue after 12 weeks. :-(",

I'm currently 16 weeks today and love reading the different blogs tailored more towards my current week. The only down side to this app is that you have to pay for it after week 14. Since I used it everyday I went ahead and purchased it. :),
904,3,2014-11-29T02:39:25.000Z,BornAgainWifeAndMom,Good app!,"I like this app. I think the blogs are really helpful as you get to see what to expect for each week of development. Even though this is my 8th baby, it is still fun to look and see ""You are ____ weeks pregnant today"" when I sign into the app. It's nice to be reminded exactly if my gestation at each sign in. I also like the still shots of baby in womb. It's very informational and causes you to make sure to take care of YOU during your pregnancy :)!",

I even learned a few things I didn't know with this. It's easy to figure out, very informative, and very visually engaging. The ONLY thing I wish it included was quickening and lightening on the timeline. Other than that, it's absolutely perfect! :)",
906,1,2015-08-07T10:18:29.000Z,Noneyaüòú,Uninstalled,"Started using this app when I found out I was pregnant. I'm now 15wks and last wk (my 14th wk) the app stopped working. I contacted someone by email to only be told that the app stops working on lite version at 13wks (not stated in the description btw), so disappointing app! Unless you dnt mind paying for it after the ""trial period"" as I'm calling it, dnt even bother installing. There's plenty more good quality pregnancy apps out there that offer the same services (baby's development and your body changes) FOR FREE! I'm actually loving one right now, that I started using just yesterday.",
907,5,2016-09-07T14:08:20.000Z,Dedicated user!,Worth paying for upgrade,A lot of reviews are unhappy that there is a payment required to use it passed 15 weeks but it well worth the couple bucks. This is the best pregnancy app with SO much information and tools to help track the pregnancy. I would recommend this app over any of the other pregnancy apps.,
908,2,2016-11-29T22:38:18.000Z,Skfjxhdbshxjv93728,Have to pay at 15 weeks! Not happy.,"Had this app from very early pregnancy (found out at 3 weeks) and loved it, until we got to 15 weeks and found out we had to pay to keep using it - nowhere does it ever say you have to pay until you have a chance to fall in love with it and then have to pay. Granted, it's only $4, but I would rather have another app for free than pay that. Ovia is totally free, and cuter than this one - I recommend that one if you don't want to pay either!",

It'd be nice to have a daily water intake tracker to monitor the amount of water you're drinking every day. Just a thought. I know there are other apps for this, but the recommended amount for pregnant women is different.",
912,1,2014-12-23T10:19:19.000Z,brifenn,Dishonest,"This app is marketed as a pregnancy app when it should be  advertised at the first 14 weeks app because literally everything on the app becomes completely unavailable after that. And even during those short few weeks, there are many functions of the app that are unavailable to non-paying users. I didn't find anything original and/or different about this app compared to the HONESTLY a free ones that would make me want to pay $4 for it. It's absolutely ridiculous. Wish I didn't waste my time downloading it.",
913,5,2015-01-07T15:24:23.000Z,IAMBLESSED2015,AWSOME APP!!!!,This app was exactly what I was looking for when I found out I was pregnant.

The rest are for paid members. I find this very sneaky that this was hidden until now. I might have paid for it if they mentioned it in the beginning. The app itself isn't that great to worth paying for. There are other pregnancy apps with better information than this one. Also, the movement and animation at the top is very annoying. Should only animate once when the app first loads.",

933,5,2015-08-21T22:58:00.000Z,Caitai90,Worth paying for.,I was caught off guard when the 15 week point came around and I realized you have to purchase the full app to continue using it. I was hesitant at first but love the layout of the app and all of the information it provides. By far the best pregnancy app I've used and I was happy to pay for it.,

But this app stops giving you any information at 15 weeks, asking instead that you buy the paid version. Their app is not special or interesting enough for me to want to pay for information I can get for free literally all over the Internet and via other apps. I will be deleting this one. I highly recommend Ovia if you're looking for an informative, modern app with a gorgeous interface.",

I understand app developers need to make money by making you buy upgrades or pay full for the app. It's not about how much the upgrade is but the fact that says ""free"" and then at 15 weeks you have to buy the app so you can continue to use it. If I wanted to pay for an app I wouldn't have get a free app from the beginning. Very disappointed, looking for a new app right after I delete this one.",

However, this app's advertising is misleading. It is not free as you will need to pay $3.99 to access any content post 14 weeks. Had the app been up front about the cost I likely would have paid. However, I do not enjoy being coerced into the payment and will be switching apps. I wish I had just downloaded a different app from the start in order to prevent the need to re-enter all data.",

It was by far my favorite pregnancy app. Now I'm deleting it because if it tells me to upgrade to the premium version one more time I'm going to scream! Almost every single button I click takes me to that screen and I have to back up and try my request again. In the 45 seconds I've been using the app tonight, it's taken me to the premium app suggestion 7 times. If I wanted to upgrade, I would. But I DON'T! I'm done. Deleting.",
985,5,2015-02-20T17:51:12.000Z,Mrs. Pro-Creation,Adorable.,Nevermind the haters of this app. Those people have nothing better to do except judge. The app does what it is supposed to and I used it to follow my Sister in Law's pregnancy and now my own. If you find anything unsatisfactory then use Google for more resources! The app never forced anyone to use JUST it anyway. Get a life haters.,

Gives you many baby names, what you would need in your hospital bag, etc. I'm a first time mom with 10 weeks left & it was very helpful due to the fact I was clueless on mostly everything. Thanks to this app I gained some knowledge.",

994,4,2015-03-05T11:04:13.000Z,Theologiangirl,Great! But...,"I love this app! It has a beautiful UI, but it really needs a place for a daily journal. It would also be cool if it had some kind of ""daily survey"" where you can check off some of your symptoms (some could be funny) and wrote notes /take pics. But I do really like the app. It gives great tips and I love the appointment and to do list.",
995,1,2015-08-02T19:15:38.000Z,Burr burr swag,Hate having to upgrade !!,"It was a great app and I looked and heckled it everyday in my pregnancy until week 14 and then I got cut off unexpectedly because I had to pay for the rest of my weeks of pregnancy. Absolute crap !! What a serious rip off. You should make the Pro version like other period tracker apps that you can upgrade with cooler things as an incentive, not to track your 3/4 of pregnancy. Very upsetting. It honestly was the best pregnancy app that looked the best and had the best pictures and information. Pretty sad.",

I definitely liked the week, day, & trimester count it has.  The unfortunate part for me, as this is my third, the info I was needing refreshed on I had to pay for!  So I looked into another pregnancy app that was completely free and got the refresher info or places to look for it on the app.",

That was until day 91 when it stopped advancing.  It has kept track of my progress on the initial page but the daily and weekly updates do not go past day 91.  I have deleted and reinstalled the app four times in an effort to get it to work properly again and nothing has worked.  Overall, a very disappointing experience.",

1056,5,2015-07-14T05:09:31.000Z,Lamalindsay,Very useful!!,I really like seeing the new baby images each week. It gives me an idea of what my little girl looks like. The weekly information on how she's growing is also very nice. It has several useful features.  No glitches in it so far.,
1057,2,2015-07-19T16:22:34.000Z,punkyluvr,Great until you have to purchase,"I really enjoyed this app a lot....until I got to week 15. At that point I was no longer able to use all of features within the app, even small things like info for each week. I found this very frustrating and I feel that there are other, free, apps that give you similar info and features. I wouldn't really waste my time with this one.",
1058,5,2015-10-01T12:33:15.000Z,Avance09,Best Pregnancy App!,This app is the best as far as pictures and information. The pictures look so life like. There are in app purchases though that you will have to buy to get past a certain week. I thought it was totally worth it!,

But as my pregnancy moved along I slowly weeded them out. I'm 37 weeks pregnant now and it's the only app I continue to use. It's the best one and worth the money!",

1085,5,2016-02-18T13:19:02.000Z,Tarona79,Very Helpful,This app was very helpful to me and helped me show my partner and my children what was going on inside me. It also helped me out too. Many times I didn't understand what was going on with me and this app explained everything.,
1086,1,2016-08-19T13:12:24.000Z,Britferr,Misleading... Not a free app.,"So disappointed... Was really liking this app, but as soon as I hit my second trimester, features stopped working unless I upgraded to the pay app. By 16 weeks the app was pretty much not functional at all because every useful feature was locked without the upgrade. Would have much rather seen that it was a $4 app from the beginning and I would have been more likely to pay for it. I feel misled and will find a new app to use.",

1095,4,2014-11-30T07:25:29.000Z,1235Lilly,Great!!! But...,I love this app. It's simply amazing if you're pregnant and tells you so much. It's the best app I could find and I absolutely love it. I only rated it four stars because it would be even better if you got all the weeks free instead of 1-14 for free but I think even I might like it enough to find it worth it.,
1096,5,2015-12-08T13:09:13.000Z,Becky Scalise,Love this app,This app has been helpful to me since I haven't had a baby in 11 yrs.

I only use the app for 9 months and have to pay for it. That is ridiculous and I refuse to do so.  I used to use the app to show my class of 4 yr olds the different stages that the baby was at bc they are very excited about a baby growing in their teachers tummy.,

I can't believe people are paying for this app when it offers nothing different then all the great free apps. Why waste your money good info but no different than all the others,

I can see paying for one or two extras or no ads but when I download a free pregnancy app I should at least be able to get the week-by-week updates for free. If you want to see more than an arm or leg in the weekly pictures you also have to pay. Overall I am pretty disappointed and will be deleting this app and downloading a different one.,

I wouldn't mind if it were forthcoming with the price but the fact that it's ""free"" and then you get the oh it's 3.99 after 15 weeks is not only disappointing but it's deceitful. I really enjoyed this app and would have gladly paid for it but to con me into it is disgusting. There are better apps that are upfront about the price. Too bad, I would have recommended this app.",

However, I didn't like the fact that after the first trimester you have to upgrade and pay $4 dollars for it.","We're happy to hear you like the App overall. The one-off payment we ask protects your privacy and ensures your app won't have lots of ads. We understand your opinion but free apps may use your data and we respect your privacy.

I can only look at my past weeks which is useless and it used to not be like this.

It seems pretty decent and you get used to using it then it blocks everything unless you pay the full price after you've progressed far enough in your pregnancy.

1698,2,2014-10-29T21:02:43.000Z,Ellory's Mommy,14 weeks only?!?,I really like this app but nowhere in the description did it say that after 14 weeks you had to purchase the app to continue using it. Not worth it when there are others out there completely free for the term of my pregnancy.,
1699,1,2017-05-22T04:26:35.000Z,Iowamama,Not worth it,Had it on the beginning and used it often but I wanted a community type so I can chat with women due around my time. This doesn't have that. So I stopped using it. Came back to it about 2wks later and now I have to pay just to read random things. Completely lame.,"The one-off payment we ask protects your privacy and ensures your app won't have lots of ads. We understand your opinion but free apps may use your data and we respect your privacy. So, after the 14th week of pregnancy, we ask for small one-off payment instead. We hope you understand."

1769,1,2017-05-24T14:40:48.000Z,Melby85Carbo,Disappointing,It's all great up until you hit 14 weeks. After that you have to pay if you want to see images of what your baby looks like each week. There are so many other apps that offer the same thing for free. Don't waste your money on this.,"The one-off payment we ask protects your privacy and ensures your app won't have lots of ads. We understand your opinion but free apps may use your data and we respect your privacy. So, after the 14th week of pregnancy, we ask for small one-off payment instead. We hope you understand."

2019,1,2017-05-25T21:23:14.000Z,ISIMPLYJAZZY,If only it was really free!,"Was a great app at first but then it ask you to pay once you reach a certain amount of weeks pregnant. Not worth paying when there's other free apps that comes with daily forums, discussion boards and groups you can talk to.","While we understand your opinion, we would like to highlight that free apps aren't really free - they might use your data or fill your app with lots of ads. We prefer to ask for a small one-off payment instead after the 14th week of pregnancy. We hope you understand."

3048,4,2015-07-20T06:16:21.000Z,darkladydisdain,"Good info and images, just needs some tweaks","Overall, this was a great purchase--This was one of the only pregnancy apps I could find that didn't talk down to me (What to Expect is awful, I deleted it after a few days--how insulting). The weekly summaries are great and helpful, and the images are beautiful. I just wish they'd show full-length images for each week, as some are a close-up of the face...I want to see the whole baby, not just the face! I also feel like there is way too much twin information...it should only pop up if the user selects multiples. You're reading about changes to expect in your body and then they always throw in a ""if you're having multiples"" tidbit. This is in addition to the separate multiples section! Just seems unnecessary since twins are not the norm.",

I honestly only downloaded this app to show my kids the baby‚Äôs development, and for that purpose, it‚Äôs fabulous! However, all of the articles and advice are either vague, not helpful (particularly for a veteran parent), or contain biased or incorrect information. What concerns me the most is the nutrition information. Yes, fruits and veggies are vital to a healthy pregnancy, but the push to avoid too many calories and eat lean meats is troubling. In order to increase blood volume, pregnant women require adequate protein‚Äî 90-100 grams a day and adding more when they‚Äôre active‚Äî and 2600 calories a day, adding more to make up for that burned in exercise/activity. Blood volume increase both helps to prevent preeclampsia and other pregnancy complications.",We appreciate your thoughtful feedback and will share it with our development team.

If you‚Äôre so smart to make an app, I‚Äôm sure you would know the definition of what ‚Äúfree‚Äù means... sorry, but your misleading information means I don‚Äôt trust anything this app has to offer. I could care less that you don‚Äôt want my data and that free means there has to be ads. None of my other pregnancy apps are full of ads and they are FREE and do the EXACT same thing this app does... with a better screen format and easier usage. Why would I pay for this app when all the information you provide is not only free on the internet BUT also other apps.","The one-off payment we ask protects your privacy and ensures your app won't have lots of ads.

3475,2,2017-11-30T15:59:05.000Z,angeldust___,Wow,I loved it until they tried to make me pay just to look at where I am in my pregnancy this should be an enjoyable moment and an app simply trying to help keep you updated not an app trying to get money off of people And the developer response to the woman saying how they shouldn‚Äôt be making us pay is a bull crap excuse you shouldn‚Äôt make people pay after 14 weeks you money hungry butt hole,"The one-off payment we ask protects your privacy and ensures your app won't have lots of ads. We understand your opinion but free apps may use your data and we respect your privacy. So, after the 14th week of pregnancy, we ask for small one-off payment instead. We hope you understand."
3476,1,2018-04-07T07:23:14.000Z,belaleo,Why i have to pay 2 times,Been trying to restore the purchase for 6 months now. Emailed management many times from apple and android they just ignore me ..,"When you switch from Android to iOS, you do indeed need to purchase the App again. Unfortunately, we can't influence that scenario. Google and iTunes are competitors and therefore don't share sales. Thank you for the feedback and we wish you all the best for the remainder of your pregnancy."
3477,4,2018-05-01T20:27:26.000Z,MomaNickie,Good fun app,I paid for the app from the get go. I like everything it has to offer. It could use a public forum to chat with moms/dads/parents like BBC or something like that- it‚Äôs always nice to have someone to talk to that is on the same timeline as you in pregnancy. BBC people have gotten very rude over the years so I think that a forum in this app could help people who just want advice or someone to share the journey with. I like that there is so much information on it about things I am going through right when I open the app. I get to use the pictures to show my other kids what little sis/bro looks like and they love it too!,Thanks for your thoughtful review - we will share your feedback with our development team. Thanks to comments and suggestions from customers like you we can continue to improve our App!
3478,1,2019-01-21T22:01:08.000Z,elweej,"I paid, still ads",This app has pretty good content but I paid for it and I still have amazon ads literally flashing at me. I didn‚Äôt pay for this app to ponder how amazon fits into my future as a father.,We‚Äôre always happy to hear feedback and improvement suggestions.  We do on occasion have Amazon offers in the app which will be relevant to your pregnancy journey.  The Amazon ad is carefully designed not to interfere with your user experience. You can contact support@health-and-parenting.com if you would like to share any further improvement suggestions with us.

3577,1,2015-11-26T04:45:09.000Z,JasperHurst,Devastated,"I was happy with it for my first 7 months of pregnancy until my iPhone needed updating. For some reason the app would not update, therefore I deleted it from my phone( not my cloud) and re-downloaded it back to my phone. Upon doing this, the app did not recognize my email address once I tried logging on nor would it allow me to reset my password. Remember, I've had it 7 months and used it daily with auto log in so I had trouble remembering my password. Well, it never recognized my email address so I created a new account, which only allowed me to view the pre- inserted baby photos until the 15 week mark. I had purchased this app for $3.99, 7 months ago and have used it daily. All of my info was lost because it did not remember my account.My weekly pregnancy photos that I uploaded, my completed birthing plan, notes, doctor visit info, important and exciting info that I've gathered for all of my pregnancy to date. I am devastated. I would not recommend this app as whatever glitch was in their system on this day cost me valuable info, not to mention my $3.99. And I do not have long to go.",

3580,4,2013-03-07T18:05:50.000Z,Nyaht,Good,I like this app I love the pictures of the baby and the information is great. I don't like that the belly pictures are of a naked body... I don't know maybe it is just me but I don't really feel comfortable showing people what the baby looks like in the belly because they have to look at a naked butt.  Ha ha sorry I just don't want to make friends/family/coworkers feel uncomfortable... So I end up using my other app that just shows the belly.,
3581,5,2013-10-26T14:42:53.000Z,Preggernsd,Great app!,"This app was great, especially for first time pregnancy. The info always correlated w info that was read in pregnancy book/ what the md told us. Was useful for far away family- you can just email them pages of what is going on.",

3586,2,2018-04-01T22:07:31.000Z,one_woman,Hidden payment blocks app at week 14,"The app was good up until week 14. At that point, if you want current info, you have to pay. I understand this is the chosen business model. Bait for the first trimester and then: Surprise! You can't use it anymore. Fine, but like others said, be upfront about it. Respect your users. Don't try to trick them. It's not that premium content is paid at that point. Your daily status and everything is locked. Not a fan of this approach and will delete this one and use one of the other free ones despite the hassle. Not a happy customer.","Thanks to feedback from customers like you, we now offer free access to the blogs and baby daily and weekly articles. We now only charge for the additional tools, such as the Contraction Timer, Kick Counter, etc. We hope you will consider trying the App again."
