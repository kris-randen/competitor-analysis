0,5,2021-06-10T16:00:16.000Z,picard35,A wellness tracker that actually stands out from the rest.,"I‚Äôve seen and used many different wellness trackers during my time trying to meet a healthy weight. And all of these apps are great. They do there job and I have nothing to complain about. However, I never stick with any wellness apps because they are too good, and therefore, overly complicated. This is the pet where this app comes in. It‚Äôs dead simple to use which keeps me coming back to log my food intake. As long as you have a scale to weigh the food your eating, this simple app makes the chore of logging macros into kinda a  game in a way. When I wake up I genuinely want to weigh my food and log it into the app because it‚Äôs very accurate, very thorough, and very effective. But finding all that in an app that is as simple as this one is hard to find. The app even automatically tally‚Äôs all of your calories for the day and differentiates the macros. This way in a matter of a second you can figure out if you met your goal. This app also integrates with restaurants so even if you have to eat out you can still log your calories for the food you order! All in all this app is effective, accurate, it‚Äôs fun to use and most importantly, its actually easy to understand and use!",
1,5,2020-05-15T13:49:19.000Z,SandcastleDream,Love  It,"I have used a lot of trackers over the years and this one tops them all. Simple to use.  Let‚Äôs you edit freely, copy frequently used foods from previous days, great food search database, ability to enter custom foods, recipes, so versatile. Let‚Äôs you enter your goals not only for weight, but for ratio of protein, fat and carbs, a feature I‚Äôve been craving. Tracks these ratios, plus calories and exercise. Shows these in a  usable format as you log throughout the day. Love that you can click on any section, lunch, snacks, and get individual recap of calories, ratios, etc. This let‚Äôs you analyze each meal or the whole day. I am just below pre-diabetic so my goal is to up my protein and lower my carb and sugar intake. What a surprise when you can track these and see what you are really eating! This is so motivating and makes me feel in control, giving me the tools I need to manage what I eat and to meet my goals of delicious, easy, healthy eating. I just did a web search for high protein, low carb snacks and found many things I actually like that I can‚Äôt wait to log to see how they improve my ratios.  Thank you for this tracker!",
2,5,2019-06-05T15:38:20.000Z,skykbelle2,LOVE,"I‚Äôve had this app for over 3 years and it‚Äôs the best tracking app I‚Äôve found...and it‚Äôs free with no paid upgrades! What I love about it is that you can scan foods in with a barcode scanner, you can add your own custom foods or recipes, they have an EXTENSIVE restaurant database, all foods in the app are very accurate (unlike other apps) so you don‚Äôt have so guess if whah you‚Äôre tracking is accurate or not, the nutritionix team is very fast to respond with any questions or concerns about the app, I‚Äôve emailed support a few times about little bugs and they fix them immediately, it‚Äôs super user friendly, it shows you the meal‚Äôs whole nutrition and the day‚Äôs while nutrition facts, you can see how much you‚Äôve eaten for the day and see how much you have left...I could go on! I am a nutrition and macro coach and I recommend this app to all my clients.",
3,4,2019-06-11T02:02:26.000Z,ACompletelyUniqueNickname,"Great database and functionality, some minor problems","Overall, the functionality of this food tracker is the best I‚Äôve found.  Large database of foods with correct/reasonable values for generic foods, the ability to scan bar codes, set up your make your own meals/recipes, a restaurant meal planner... Other similar apps seem to be inundated with incorrect information that the public has entered, making it hard to get good tracking.",
4,4,2021-01-20T14:10:55.000Z,EastTNCowgirl,Almost there!,"I‚Äôve been piloting this app as a replacement for MFP.  (I‚Äôm looking for an app without all the social content, feeds, gamification, etc. that clutter up the experience and just distract me from why I‚Äôm using the app.  The crowd sourced nutrition data on MFP has been a problem for me -  many users are careless or do wacky things with their data entry, making it unreliable.  Also, don‚Äôt want to pay the hefty subscription fee for some basic items like macro tracking.)  Track addresses all of the above reasons I‚Äôm looking for a new nutrition tracker.  However,  are a few things Track still needs:  ability to set different calorie goals for each day of the week (I plan for a little more intake on weekends), the Calendar Date picker seems broken, tablet or desktop interfaces are not available, and the ability to copy an entire day would be a great addition.) Overall, I think it‚Äôs likely Track may be my new nutrition tracker, especially if the calendar date picker bug is fixed and some of the above enhancements may be available in the future.",
5,5,2017-10-07T18:05:53.000Z,RebeccaSelko,My favorite food tracker,"I tried multiple food/diet/nutrition apps, including My Fittness Pal, but found this app was easier to use adding individual foods or creating recipes with nutrition macros broken down per serving. Can adjust personal goals for daily amounts of protein, carbs, and fats so it fits a variety of dietary needs‚Äî which for me is a low carb, high fat diet to control Type 2 diabetes. It quickly pulls up what I typically eat at certain times of day so I don‚Äôt have to go looking to log 2 eggs every morning. LOVE that it‚Äôs a free app with so many food nutrition info available (and easily scaled to my serving) or to scan with my phone. Plus tons of restaurants are included.  Easily log exercise and water intake. So many awesome features. Did I mention it‚Äôs free? Helps me stay on track and motivated. Thank you for this awesome app!",
6,5,2019-02-09T21:56:44.000Z,mp_dk,Only app that has nutrition split for restaurant meals,"Its the best free calorie counter app and nutrition log so far. I have used so many apps including my plate and atkins, but this is the best. No other app has macros splig and nutrition content for restaurant foods and daily grocery items. Its great that it allows me to set my own daily macro percentage and helps me keep track of the macros. The daily weight log and water intake is a bonus. Most apps give water tracker only for premium users. This app even allows me to create my own food and recipes. It has recommended tab for snacks suggested by dietitian, i don‚Äôt use that much though. The only thing this app doesnt have is suggested food recipes, like keto friendly, high protein foods etc. If they include recipes and tips, Nutritionix will be the best!!",

I ran them simultaneously for a week or 2 just to compare. I‚Äôm now strictly on Nutritionix and I‚Äôm getting to know it although I‚Äôve ran into a snag when trying to copy things. I haven‚Äôt figured out yet if that was my phone, the app or I‚Äôm doing something wrong. I no longer use my Fitbit as it‚Äôs old I have a much newer, better Garmin Forerunner which the app does not support. Get Garmin on here for exercise tracking! üòÅ The food inventory is pretty good but does not match that of MyFitnessPal just yet, but it‚Äôs close. I‚Äôm assuming as this app is around longer it will. But it‚Äôs certainly easy enough to find comparables.  I love the ratio breakdowns per mean, not just total on the day. Great app!",
9,2,2019-02-21T22:18:45.000Z,notuncajeff,Nope,"It looks like it does just what I was looking for, allowing me to talk to it and tell it what I‚Äôm eating instead of making me type in stuff.  But with a privacy policy that says that Nutritionix owns all my data and will resell it to anyone they choose, without any provisions for anonymization or any other privacy-preserving measures, it‚Äôs a non-starter.",
10,5,2018-02-06T17:23:15.000Z,dyparker,Lacks Weight Tracking,I used this app back in the late summer and loved it.  It‚Äôs so easy to use and would track your weight loss progress in addition to calories and exercise.   Now I‚Äôm using it again but I‚Äôm not able to enter or see my progress in terms of weight loss.  There used to be a graph.  It looks like that part of the app is grayed out now and not available.  Total bummer.  Looking for another app but seriously disappointed.  üòî,Thank you for reaching out! The weight graph is still an available feature in the Track app. Can you send a screenshot of your Stats page to our team at support@nutritionix.com so that we can make sure your weight graph is set to a valid date range?

11,5,2018-10-09T02:49:48.000Z,dcgmorr,Most comprehensive app,"The food label for the individual is the best!! Tried other apps but this one is by far the most comprehensive. I‚Äôve shared this app with two others who are using different apps and they switched to Nutritionix. I find the ‚Äúfood‚Äù labels most beneficial. In addition to food labels that list the nutrients, a label is created listing the individual‚Äôs intake throughout the day. I can check my numbers prior to consuming any food, thereby, making it easier to make healthier choices. The app also tracks exercise and water consumption. Adding foods to the list is easy. It has most of the foods already in its data base. I‚Äôve only had to create (add) one food item and it was very easy to do.",
12,5,2018-12-31T22:20:52.000Z,Wattslyne,A True Lifesaver,"This app is a real gem for those who must track their diet due to a medical condition.  The vast database of foods and menu items is indispensable when trying to eat healthy ‚Äúon the road‚Äù.  I‚Äôve lost 20 lbs ( 9 kg ) in 4 months!!!  Additionally, it has helped to bring cholesterol, sodium and blood sugar under control.  My physicians have been completely blown away and asked for details so they can share with other patients.

I had to start over.  It‚Äôs a great app and I‚Äôve lost 16 lbs so far.  I gained weight after a foot surgery last year.  This app lets you keep up with your daily totals of food.  If I went over the allotted calories I have set for myself,  I still keep up with everything.  When I don‚Äôt lose I can look back and see what I need to do the next week.",

I tried all the calories counter apps and considering this is free, no doubt it‚Äôs the best app to execute. It‚Äôs data driven by the user, scan items to add to data base for others to use. This is also why there is such a. Huge library of restaurants and groceries to pick from. This is also why it‚Äôs free. I‚Äôm talking to you FitnessPal.",

16,2,2021-03-12T22:11:42.000Z,shinjukublack,Integration non-existant,"Nutritionix has a very good database.

You can also record servings for your recipes.  Summary stats help you know the nutrition profile of what you are eating, and your weight over time. Food values are also validated and accurate. Recording what I eat gives me immediate feedback about my caloric intake, and makes me aware of the food that I am eating. I must use this app in order to lose weight. When I try to lose weight by ‚Äúguesstimating‚Äù what I am eating at the end of the day, I don‚Äôt lose weight. This app works for me.",

I originally started using this to get aggregate sodium levels which this app does beautifully. Most of the detailed data comes from their database and you can see all of macronutrients and micronutrients by single food, by meal or by day with ease. You can add custom foods or build recipes as needed. The app does a good job of making your most frequently tracked items easy to find.",

It offers you calorie intake goal and an option of deciding how many of those will be carbs, how many fats and how many proteins. I can't believe it's free. I imagine it will stop being free one day otherwise how would the developer justify all the work done to develop this beautiful app. I would even pay for it only if it was one time reasonable charge to own it for life instead of monthly payments - like my fitness pal who charges 9.99/month. I'd never pay this much for an app.",
21,5,2017-11-14T22:30:46.000Z,PMRosenberg,Truly a 6 Star App!,"With the help of the Nutritionix I have been able to lose 40+ lbs over the course of 6 months by tracking calories, logging foods, eating smarter and exercising daily. This app has made calorie tracking into a game and the weight loss has been a healthy 1 to 1.5 lbs a week. The interface is simple and clean. 99.9% of the foods I eat are already in the system which is amazing. Adding a food is as simple as a snapping a couple of photos. I recently tried a few other trackers just to see if there was a better choice and they all fell short. They could not compare to Nutritionix!",
22,5,2018-01-31T18:08:34.000Z,Jones3113,Best tracking app out there,I love this app. I have tried what seems like every tracking app out there and nothing compares to this one. It's so easy to use. It's simple and tracks exactly what I need. The best part is the database full of all the foods. Seriously! When using the other apps there would always be at least two foods per meal that wasn't in the database and I'd have to try and figure out myself to add. This app has just about everything I scan! There have been a couple calorie discrepancies and they were so nice about it. I really like this app and recommend it.,

Can you check your Preferences - 'My Profile' and confirm that your timezone default is incorrect? Please keep us posted on that at support@nutritionix.com. We would also be interested in receiving some examples of foods that you tried to log that you could not find in the database.

The ability to break down; carb, protein and fat of each item, each meal, and each day allows me to match my goals in each category throughout the day.  No calorie tracking app should impede progress and cause frustration and this certainly does not.",
25,5,2019-01-25T14:06:37.000Z,theMarkness,One small caveat,"Best nutrition app I‚Äôve seen. Only issue I have is that it will double count nutrition info on my iPhone health app. For example if I eat 2000 calories a day it shows up as 4000 on the health app. I can manually delete the second entry but that can be a pain. It only shows the double counted calories and other nutritional info on the health app, so not a huge issue but if that could be fixed this would be 5 stars all day. Still going to continue to use the app as it‚Äôs the best one out there. If you can get back to me on a fix it would be greatly appreciated!!",

I really like the Track app. It has a large data base of foods. It‚Äôs easy to track and copy foods. The scan and the search both return good results. It‚Äôs easy to add a recipe or a custom food. It also allows you to quickly select foods that you eat frequently. You can adjust macro levels and get a break down of macros by day or by meal. Simple with all the right info.

I was told to just use it on my laptop until they fixed it. After about two weeks there was another update. It does the same thing. Too bad, I really liked it, but on my iPhone it is useless now!

I have one huge problem: Most days I‚Äôll update food for the day before or the day after (good planning) ... but every single time I update food for a different day the app will log it on the present day in the timeframe that I‚Äôm presently in. Every. Single. Day. For over a year. I‚Äôll update something for a different day than I‚Äôm currently in and every single day it will log the food I scan on the day that I‚Äôm presently in.  IF this gets changed I will be more than happy to give this app the full FIVE STARS I know it deserves!!!!,
47,5,2019-10-26T02:43:57.000Z,mleonehotmail,Wow what an app,This is incredibly The best app of all the apps i‚Äôve downloaded. There‚Äôs a scanner that inputs all the values on the label saves time not putting the values in yourself.  You can still put values in yourself if not in the database.  After you upload the photo they will add this into the database in 3 business days.  This stands out why i will keep this app for along while.  it‚Äôs free without the upgrade.  it‚Äôs nice to see there are worthwhile apps that‚Äôs not too good to be true. thanks very much,
48,3,2020-04-23T05:15:57.000Z,YAHis#01,Really good but some issues,I like how everything in the app is so easy to use and I can track everything including the steps I take and adding showering etc... on there. What I don‚Äôt like is that recently when I track calories burned it doesn‚Äôt save most of it and it cancels it out when it reloads again. Please fix this issue as it‚Äôs been making me want to switch to a different but which I wouldn‚Äôt want to because this app is so detailed and easy to use compared to the other apps but i just want to have a great experience with this app that I like.,
49,2,2020-11-08T18:43:44.000Z,Spin-Diva,You Will Not Get Accurate Results,You almost had me ready to switch my current tracking app...till I put in a custom entry and your app doesn‚Äôt do the calories math based on the foods macros.  Posted or published calorie counts are notoriously incorrect because food manufacturers are allowed to post incorrect data up to/lower than 10%.  You can over or under count by a LOT if you don‚Äôt allow the macros math.  You have a pretty app...but it‚Äôs not going to give people accurate calorie counts the way you have the app currently built.  It‚Äôs a shame because it seemed like something I was really looking for...an all-in-one health and nutrition app.,

It takes you to a ton of information in a snap, and I like the way it analyzes your entries. It‚Äôs really easy to add homemade foods. One important thing I don‚Äôt see, however, is a breakdown of added sugars (as opposed to naturally occurring), which I‚Äôm trying to keep below 20 grams per day. Possibly in an update?",

However, the ‚Äúdietician-approved recommendation‚Äù tab is just advertising. There‚Äôs no convincing scientific proof to suggest people should be consuming weird supplements from companies that make pseudoscientific claims about their benefits or that they should be downing unnecessary protein supplements. I find this a disappointing move and one that is truly lacking in integrity. There‚Äôs so much misinformation on nutrition out there already and the general public is ill-equipped to parse it. This sort of advertising is harmful and ought to be reconsidered.","Rest assured - the Nutritionix app will continue to be a free app. You only need to subscribe to share your diet with a coach.  So if you are not using the Coach Portal sharing feature, then your Track experience is still completely independent of any subscriptions and will remain that way.

This app does not count nutrition from branded foods! Almost everything I eat including packaged organic fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables are from Trader Joe‚Äôs. If I scan that in or use existing entries, none of those nutrients are counted! Also if I scan in vitamins, they are not on file and I submitted photos but they are branded vitamins obviously so they probably won‚Äôt count either. What is the point of scanning in products if it doesn‚Äôt count the nutrients? It only counts the nutrients in generic foods, not from anything you scan in. Even MyFitnessPal counts basic nutrients from scanned foods. Also it added 1% alcohol to my total macros when I had nothing even resembling alcohol! Makes me doubt the whole app. I will definitely stick to NyNetDiary which has a better UI and fantastic nutrition tracking of like 30 nutrients and counts vitamin supplements!",

I was more than surprised that the information was not listed on the Applebee's website-menu.  I googled ""Applebee's nutrional information"" and the Nutritionix Track site was one that was listed.  I was amazed to be able to find the exact meal that I had ordered last evening.  This was the information I was seeking.  I was able to download the app to both my iPhone and iPad.  I really appreciate the fact that Nutritionix Track is able to provide the missing piece to my daily meal plan. It's easy to keep track of the the foods eaten at home, but those foods or meals eaten outside the home become a mystery when considering the nutritional facts. At the end of the day, the information utlimately would be incomplete.  i find that we eat out more often than I would like to admit.  The Nutritionix Track app restaurant food search provides that missing piece to complete the daily picture.   I am also very impressed by the scanner box to search for foods, and found that many of my grocery store items are on the food log. The manual entry for items not found on the log was easy to navigate.",

I didn't give it 5 stars because I think there is room for growth when it comes to the nutritional analysis. Would like to see it calculate macronutrient percentages and percentage of total calories from saturated fat. Also, the presentation of the nutritional analysis in the form of a nutrition label is so clever and easy to read- IF you can read a food label! Some people are still learning. On the other hand, this is a great way to get people familiar and comfortable with food labels and hopefully reading them in the stores too! Are there plans for the nutrition label to be updated to reflect the new changes coming out soon?",

You can just talk to your phone and tell it what you're eating and how much and it figures it out. I've done enough of it to know that it's pretty darn accurate. Nothing helps you keep track of your food intake better than logging your food, but if it's a pain he won't do it. This is so easy!!! This is probably my favorite app of anything on my phone. Wow!

I quickly found the source of those extra calories. After making immediate adjustments the weight started falling off. This has been the easiest diet I have ever been on.

447,3,2017-05-04T13:29:58.000Z,PrincessKitty186,One major flaw,"This is a very basic calorie counter which is what I wanted but there are two major flaws. One is that when you add items in your basket, you can't designate a different meal time for each item and log them all at the same time. You have to do breakfast foods together and then lunch, etc. They all log as one meal time. What's the point of even putting them in a basket then?  It should just log straight to whatever meal you choose. The second flaw is that when you click on an item, it automatically puts it in your basket. I want to see the details of the item first before I put it in the basket but it just puts it in there when you click on it to see if it's the one you want to choose.","Thank you for providing this great feedback! Currently, you can only log to one meal time at once. The purpose of the Basket is to give you the opportunity to review your foods and finalize details such as quantity, measure, etc. before adding to your log. You can also group foods in your Basket into one recipe before logging."

I can list the foods in the recipe and the amounts, and the number of servings, and it does all the work. I've recently switched to a low carb, high fat, normal protein diet (ketogenic diet) and the daily summary really helps me see how I can balance these macronutrients in my end of the day meal.",

I am using it to target a ketogenic diet; where my daily carbohydrates are less than 10%. This app logs the nutrition data from any food you add times the quantity.  They have a library of thousands of name brand or generic foods. So at the end of the day, it gives you a total nutrition summary which is perfect for counting calories, carbs, etc. I adjusted the daily amount of calories to increase it above 2,000 so it doesn't tell me I'm over the limit because I'm trying to gain weight.",

It also has a daily summary that actually turns your whole day into one Nutrition Label, and it  breaks down into a pie chart your carbs, protein, etc.  They put a lot of thought into making this App, and it's got so much information on tons of different foods.

I started tracking for her to see how easy it would be for her to use, and it's working out great! Scanning UPC codes is so helpful. The recipe feature is great, too, for foods she eats regularly, and it works either for a single-serving recipe or multiple-serving one and she can then designate how many servings she eats (worked great for a batch of special cookies). It would be nice to select whether one is trying to gain or lose weight, but for her, she just knows that red is good and green is bad.",

The smart 'quick add' feature was able to automatically interpret what I wrote and display it as individual items with nutrition information laid out (note: it helps if you add a serving size like ""2 eggs"" or ""1 tbsp whipped cream"" otherwise it will just select the most common one for you). Very cool! Will definitely keep using this to track meals.",

I like the nutrition label it can calculate for your daily intake and I do the math to figure out net carbs. The support team is very responsive to suggestion. If you are looking for an easy way to track  your eating, this is it. Be faithful, log everything, and then you can see an honest picture of your relationship with food and make changes to reclaim a healthy balance with food.",
463,5,2017-01-04T10:29:26.000Z,Mhaygirlhay,Simple and fun to use,I've been using this app for a couple weeks and I love how simple it is to understand . The barcode scanner is also a really fun and helpful feature to use. Right now the app only gives recommended daily calorie limits for maintaining current weight and for losing a pound a week but I would like to see an option for gaining weight. I use this app to make sure I'm eating enough throughout the day and I think that an option to set a goal for minimum amount of calories would be helpful.,

I'm trying to have my child gain weight, and I need to track her calorie intake.  It's very user friendly, it allows you to adjust serving sizes based on how much was eaten.  You can scan items from your refrigerator and it logs them in directly.  One of the best parts, is that I didn't need to sign up and enter a whole lot of useless information.  I needed an App to strictly count calories.  And this one does it perfectly.  Great job!",

Almost every item I scan is in their system and if not, it gives you the option to add it yourself.  I love that you can see your daily average intake in a pie diagram, as well as percentage. A couple of things would be nice. I'd like to see a weekly average of where I'm at with carbs, carbs broken down (if that's possible), protein, fat, and sodium.  Sodium intake is so important. But, just the way this app stands, it beats all the others I've tried.  :)",

This works much better than others I have tried and I like how you can enter your own meals. However, the one thing I think is missing and would really help to make this the best is to have the ability to enter the barcode number instead of having to take a photo if you choose. If that was a feature then without a doubt it would get 5 stars. I doubt developers read these though :)",

For example, if you type in Chobani, it defaults to the suspected vanilla or plain calorie information.  I couldn't find the flavored versions of yogurt, which are slightly higher in calories.  I also want to see the full nutrition breakdown, like My Fitness Pal has, not just calories.  It is a watered down version of that.  I was a bit disappointed since it was developed by dietitians.

When I log exercise, it doesn't subtract from my calorie count for the day or do anything to change my daily calorie allowance. I've had at least two days where I exercised enough to keep myself below my calorie goal for the day, but because the exercise isn't being recognized, my day was red instead.

Not only does it have nutritional values for many specific foods and you can change the quantity eaten, it also lets you enter custom recipes.  It of course keeps track of calories as well.

They have managed to produce an app devoid of features yet confusing and clunky to use. It's not even a streamlined version... It's just devolved. I guess I'm spoiled by the many apps out there that have great, modern features and slick intuitive interfaces. However if you want to use Alexa for food tracking, this is the garbage you are stuck with. For now. My only hope is that MyFitnessPal or WeightWatchers will hurry up and get on the Alexa wagon.",

523,5,2017-02-20T05:25:59.000Z,Samuel_H,"Smart, simple, great",Great way to track food intake. You can write stuff in natural language and the app can understand it. It also includes lots of fast food menu items so whenever you are grabbing a McDonald you can track it too.,
524,4,2017-03-24T04:58:29.000Z,Doonsuka,Great app,This app works great especially being free. It's not inundated the advertising and crap nobody wants to see. It has a great data base for easy meal logs. The only thing I would change is having the ability to edit exercises better. I cannot give it five stars due to that. Truly a great app none the less.,
525,5,2017-05-28T20:27:47.000Z,Nickname 0000000,Awesome!,"I love this app and I'm excited for the updates coming that I read about in some of the other reviews.

533,3,2017-02-06T23:09:38.000Z,Brelove44,small glitch,I loved the app at first. Then it began having glitches with certain restaurants and not allowing me to add food. The worst part was with the new update it recalculated my daily calorie intake to lose weight as 400 calories less than what it originally said. This was disappointing because that is a large difference. Considering deleting the app.,
534,4,2017-05-16T16:48:45.000Z,Madie00,Pretty good,"Would like to see them add a water section like MyFitnessPal. Also, will there be an update that allows me to use different types of measuring? Such as, only using two teaspoons of peanut butter instead of the two tablespoons that is listed on the nutritional information.","Thanks for this feedback! Have you had an opportunity to try out the Freeform feature in the Track app? In Freeform mode, you can type freely about what you ate, specifying foods in any measure. For example, just type in, ""For breakfast I ate two teaspoons of peanut butter,"" and the Track app will put 2 tsp peanut butter in your Basket under 'Breakfast' for you!

I don't like that some foods I log have the wrong calories and there's no way to really adjust it. Also, not a fan of the way you log exercises.

I was later in life diagnosed with a couple of medical conditions which restricted my diet. This tracker is great at monitor my micronutrients in addition to all the usual ones. The bar code scanner option allows me to scan my foods quickly and and easily. I can also speak my food items. If there is a food that is not in their database, it asks to take a picture of front and back, submit it, and the item is added within a day or two.

MyFitness Pal annoyed me with their constant judgement and I had to pay to get what I wanted.  (Due to low-grade eating disorder and health issues I want to focus on macronutrients, and constant warnings on my calorie consumption are counterproductive.). YouFood was okay (no judgement) but no real tracking other than the photos.",
699,4,2021-03-04T03:50:52.000Z,Paul Puddle,Easy To Use,"Been using this app for about 3 weeks now, and have enjoyed it‚Äôs ease of use and clear layout.  I really like the bar code scanning feature, the copy item feature, and especially the ability to copy a whole meal, which I just discovered.  Having a large database of available foods is also very helpful.  Tracking what I eat has helped me see where my calories are coming from, helped me make smarter choices in what I eat, and helped me to cut back on serving sizes.  But there are a few requests I would like to make. 1) Adding ‚Äúadded sugar‚Äù to the nutrition summary would be nice, as this is now required on all food labels. 2) I really like the Source of Calories bar graphs (carbs, fat, protein), and the ability to set goals for these.  What would also be helpful is to see a bar graph for the percent of total fat that comes from saturated fats, and the ability to set a goal for this as well. For example, I would like my consumed saturated fats to be no more than 10% of my total consumed fat. 3) When looking for a previous meal that I would like to copy, like the leftovers from a dinner, often I have to scroll down on my iPhone to see the dinners. Not seeing it on the previous day, I have to scroll back up to the top to see the date so I can look at an earlier day.  It would be easier to look though previous days if the date at the top stayed put, and did not scroll. 4) I also like the ability to add food items that weren‚Äôt in the database, by taking photos of the item.  However, I have done this now for a couple of items more than 2 weeks ago, and still have not seen these show up in the database.  So quicker turn around on getting items added, or communicating the status of getting them added to the submitter would be nice. Adding these features would certainly make this a 5 star app for tracking nutrition.  Thank you Nutritionix.",

As a result, I decided to track using pen and paper which was both time-consuming and cumbersome.

Sure there are always lil things you can ask to be better but over all I‚Äôve tried a few like it and this app is by far the best for me. With this app I‚Äôm on track to reach my goal of 230 lbs from 320 lbs in exactly 1 year .. Jan-1-2019 to Jan 1-2020 üí™üí™üí™,
708,5,2019-08-29T00:41:41.000Z,Myronsgirl,Great app!,"My husband and I track all of our food on paper, and we are pretty close to this app as far as calories go because we have a food scale and weigh everything we put in our mouth. But what we did not have was the percentage of fat, protein and carbs daily. Found it by accident at the bottom of the page where you track your food, and was pleasantly surprised at all the micronutrients they list and have your daily numbers there, impressive! Once we had our main foods in the system it‚Äôs pretty easy to add or move from one meal to another. Also love how it calculates your BMR for you. Another feature we love is being able to snap a photo of the bar code and it pulls up the nutritional info with a picture. And if it‚Äôs not in their database, they ask you to help them add it by simply taking a few pictures of front and nutrition label, and in 3 days they will try to have it in their database. If you are serious about loosing weight and getting a better grip on your nutrition, this app is GREAT!",
709,1,2019-07-14T05:27:26.000Z,StephW.Farrell,This app can‚Äôt tell me if I‚Äôm meeting my nutritional needs,"Am I meeting my nutritional requirements? Unfortunately, this  app can‚Äôt  tell me.  Stats need to Include %-RDA/AI for Micronutrients like selenium, all vitamins, not just the mcg or iu you ate.  Needs %-RDA/AI for Micronutrients before I can use this.  Check out fitday.com, old school but tells me if I‚Äôm getting enough selenium & vitamins in my diet.",
710,5,2017-06-26T16:13:05.000Z,Justussle,Very good app,I'm surprised this app is free.  It's perfect for my protein and calorie monitoring. (Trying to gain weight). Bar code scanning is right on and fast.,
711,5,2017-07-19T05:31:19.000Z,gcjonesz,Really easy to use,This is the easiest app I have used to count calories and nutritional facts. Love the bar code info pick up off packages. Smart. Not at all cluttered. Easy for counting even when I don't want to.,
712,5,2017-10-21T18:14:27.000Z,Tim11111111233444,Improve Health App integration!,Okay I‚Äôm not a guy who rates apps. But this app is amazing and listened to feedback. My previous problem with it was HealthKit integration. However it is now in the app! It automatically pulls my burned calories from my Apple Watch!,"Hi Tim - Thanks for that awesome feedback! We're so excited to hear that you're taking advantage of Freeform mode! And our team is working on enhancements for the HealthKit feature, so stay tuned! Happy Tracking!"
713,5,2018-02-07T13:46:15.000Z,Hellmonkeydeluxe,Exactly what I wanted,"No social media bs on this tracker or ads jumping out at you or spamming your email with questionable or useless blog entries from internet randos. Just a really good nutritional database that‚Äôs easy to log multiple foods, search by bar code, add recipes and set goals. I haven‚Äôt found a food it doesn‚Äôt have yet and it‚Äôs really easy to edit as you go through your day. Thank you SO MUCH for this.",
714,4,2018-04-16T20:38:20.000Z,Ray4rail,Great App,This is very good for tracking your carbs!  (I have type II diabetes.),"Thank you for reaching out! Our team is having trouble replicating the issue you are experiencing. To help us better understand the issue, can you please email us at support@nutritionix.com so we can troubleshoot further? Thanks!"
715,4,2018-10-31T01:09:10.000Z,pjsamjp,"Great, but isn‚Äôt tracking macros correctly","This is a great app, however I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs tracking the correct macros percentage. For example, I am on a keto diet with a daily limit of 1500 calories. My macros are 75/20/5 (F/P/C). Percentages are way off!",
716,4,2018-12-29T16:32:43.000Z,rgand454,This is a real good app for tracking macronutrients.,"The bar code recognition makes it real easy to log.  Recommend to those who are just starting out with tracking protein, carbs, and total fat.",
717,5,2019-03-01T12:19:57.000Z,Scott of TC,Best I‚Äôve tried.,"Easy to use. Scanning bar code makes it foolproof. If you can‚Äôt find the food in their data base, just scan and send to them...it helps everyone.",
718,5,2019-03-04T22:54:57.000Z,boldwings,Fantastic,"After trying various food and calorie tracker, finally I found this great app. It is not fussy, tedious or time consuming. It is simple, straightforward and just intuitively easy to use. When it comes to trackers I feel as if I have found nirvana! It has optional reminders, photo insertions.and other interactive features. I absolutely love this food tracker.",
719,4,2019-03-25T19:16:32.000Z,DrPappy,Just what I wanted,"I am trying to build muscle so I need to get enough protein and calories, but I‚Äôm also Keto so I want to keep my carbs low.  I searched through several apps and all of them seemed to be either not easy to use or charged some exorbitant fee.",
720,5,2016-06-15T18:44:47.000Z,iamasoul,Awesome App,This app is very intuitive.  The scanner is quick to identify the barcodes.  Works very well when synchronized with Amazon Echo.,
721,5,2016-06-22T18:50:06.000Z,Aleeche,Best calorie tracker out there!,"I love using this app every day. The smart track feature is so easy and pretty accurate. You save so much time, especially with meals containing a thousand different ingredients. Between that, the bar code scanner and the extensive grocery and restaurant data, there's no reason for me to go back to using LoseIt.",
722,5,2016-07-06T13:11:56.000Z,Vsalyer123,Awesome App,"I have never used a food tracker before, but due to blood work that came back a little strange, my doctor suggested this app to monitor what I eat. It couldn't be easier!",
723,2,2016-07-29T19:13:10.000Z,nancymglay,DISAPPOINTED!!!,"I got this app because I was impressed by the calculator I found online. The app doesn't have it!!! There are better apps to track food. The first thing I ate, wasn't even in the system!! Yeah, I could bar code it but that's not always convenient. I'm glad I didn't delete my other food tracking app because it's WAY better. I WILL be deleting this one and just use the ONLINE calculator!!!",
724,5,2016-09-28T19:32:47.000Z,Jules64068,Excellent app,"I love this app. I couldn't figure out why I wasn't losing weight, I don't eat much. That was true, but I was eating high calorie foods. Using this app I was able to program in that I wanted to stay at about 1000 calories per day. By ""budgeting"" my calories I was able to drop a pound a day. I've lost 9 pounds and have 4 more to go. Once I reach my goal weight I can ""up"" my calories to allow me to maintain my weight.",
725,5,2016-12-13T17:42:16.000Z,Medic39,Perfectly simply and accurate,As a paramedic and a person who recently lost over 70 pounds - I found this app super easy to use.  I have to watch my protein and calories.  If you just simply scan the bar code all the work is done.  Really the best app I have found and the customer support with questions is very friendly and fast. Again highly rate and love this app.,
726,4,2017-02-07T14:45:28.000Z,B-Maximus,New User,"Initial impression is it might be a viable replacement for LoseIt and My Fitness Pal which have descended into subscription greed.  Willing to pay for a stable, advertisement free app but not subscribe.",
727,4,2017-04-07T04:38:21.000Z,FantasticEericat,So much potential here,"This is one of the best calorie counting apps I've ever used and believe I've tried just about all of them. The database is great, comprehensive food measurements on most items, create your own recipes tool is great. Also there is a large restaurant / fast food database for logging ""cheat"" meals.",
728,5,2017-04-09T20:51:00.000Z,Cat999,This an excellent app,"I'm updating my review because the one problem I had has been solved.  This app makes it very easy to track caloric intake and see where you are at any time. I love that; it's just what I needed and it keeps me on track.  I also really like the cumulative stats to see how you're doing and how the weight loss progresses over a period of time.  The bar code scanning feature is incredibly handy and that, along with the recipe builder and the custom food feature makes it possible to accurately track everything you're eating.  The cumulative dietary information is an added bonus. I'm a vegetarian and this makes tracking my protein intake simple as well. All in all, this is a terrific and very useful app. Thank you to the developers.",
729,5,2017-05-22T15:04:15.000Z,David Jackson,So far love it,"This app makes it super easy to add your food. I love the fact that I can add multiple foods and save it as a single custom food. So in the future if I want to add a meal I can just add that custom food. I just connected it to my Amazon Alexa, and so far that seems pretty cool as well. I had a suggestion for the support staff and they got back to me really quick.",
730,5,2021-08-27T14:48:23.000Z,mama Billi,Amazing,This track has held me accountable for everything I eat. I'm losing weight and feeling better.,
