This is by far the best diet aid app I have found and I‚Äôve been through many trying to find the perfect one. It has everything you need all in one and there‚Äôs no hidden charges like others. What I especially like about this app is their extensive recipes, one thing I struggle with as an athlete is getting enough, good, calories and the recipes have helped tremendously as they are all light wholesome ingredients (perfect for an active lifestyle). Another great aspect is their new addition for notes so that way you can track how you are feeling if you are in a new diet or if you just want to decompress. There are so many meal plan options so you can choose what is right for you or just track what you are already doing!:) facts",

My goal has always been to play lacrosse at Syracuse and this app is helping me immensely. I set my goal to building muscle as I started as an athletic but still somewhat scrawny kid. I started at 135 and set my goal weight for 155 to start. With the help of this app, I have been able to get the proper amount of calories I need for my goal AND I get a step counter and calories burned counter. This app does all the math for me and I am no longer struggling with my calorie counting like I was before this app. In 2 weeks I have gained almost 6 pounds of almost 100% pure muscle. This app has made it easy to meet daily goals with reminders and helpful tools throughout the app. The recipe ideas are also helpful even if you don‚Äôt have the pro membership.",

I chose this out of all the apps because it was the only one that counted both fasting and calories. I was excited to see that there was an updated version which was supposed to address some of the issues I am having. It states that the updated version allows you to customize your fast times. It either does not or I can‚Äôt figure out how to do it. You cannot enter your meal times. The time for the 16:8 skip dinner fast automatically runs from 2:00 pm to 6:00 am. I am not even up at 6:00 am. The most frustrating part of the app is the calorie counter. It is so random. For example, a cup of grapes is listed as 350 calories. Even foods identified by brand are wrong. Not even standard measurements are correct. Sometimes a cup is listed as 4 oz sometimes 3.5, sometimes something else. Last time I checked, a cup is 8 oz. The whole thing is clunky. The only thing I do like is the estimation of weeks left until the weight goal is reached.","Hi,"

I really enjoy it, I‚Äôm eating healthier and seeing results just after a week of using it, BUT that‚Äôs because I realized of the tons of mistakes other users have made when entering nutrition facts into the database, and I‚Äôve spent quite a deal of time entering my own data. The app allows you to create food items entering any name for any kind of food with almost any nutrition facts and share that data publicly. It seems no one is checking all this data, resulting on a public database with lots of duplicated items, different nutrition facts for the same item, and misleading info. The developer must create an efficient way for users to report wrong information and remove those items from the database. Bottom line, a really good app if you‚Äôre using your own data.",

This seemed like the perfect fit at first.  As I have been using it (in USA) I have found the food database to be woefully lacking.  It has nothing to do with barcodes or barcode reader, the foods aren‚Äôt in the database.  Some very common foods from any chain restaurant are missing.  I have to add almost EVERY item manually.  That‚Äôs a non-starter after having used MyFitnessPal and never having this issue.  Like other comments, everything seems to be listed as a 1 ounce serving size.

For example, I added a product to the database and wanted to document it in the diary by a ml measurement. Even though I selected ml as a standard unit it still gives me oz when it comes tine to journal how much of the product I ate. PLEASE give us more options for measuring the food please!

Given I often use the tool to plan my next meal ahead of time, not being able to see my daily overview while in a meal is a challenge. Also, the scrolling units entry feature is frustrating. If the default is 1 ounce, but I want to enter 7 grams, I scroll the number 1 to a 7, then the Ounces unit to Grams. When I change the units, the number scrolls back and resets at 1, forcing me to have to scroll the number back to 7 again. Hopefully they‚Äôll address these issues and make the tool easier to navigate and make it easier to make entries.  Overall, still useful and robust.",
13,2,2019-11-15T23:53:06.000Z,BadMojo66,Horrible food entry,"Having used MyFitnessPal for years. I decided to switch to an app which worked better with Apple Health. After one day of frustrating food entry I wish I could get my money back. First of all it requires you to enter all food by the ounce/gram. This might be the most idiotic entry system ever. If I am on the run and stop at Chik-Fil-a for a chicken sandwich. I don‚Äôt have a scale on me to weigh it on. If I go to any major vendor or restaurant for nutritional info. It‚Äôs based on the item not the ounce. Why can I not enter food by item and a nutritional average. It say in the FAQ if I don‚Äôt make the item visible to others I can make serving size whatever I want. This wasn‚Äôt true. I unselected visible to others. Went to select and was only given weight options such as gram/ounce. How about sandwich or serving size large, medium or small. This food entry just isn‚Äôt for real people with day to day lives who can‚Äôt weigh every portion or cook every meal. It‚Äôs a real shame as I love the way it looks.","Hi! In order to keep your diary as accurate as possible, it is advisable to weigh your groceries before consumption using a kitchen balance. Over time you will also get a better sense for the quantities. Of course it's allowed and possible to estimate the quantities."

Your body burns calories all day not just during an active state. But YAZIO only tracks and displays the active calories burned. So if you walked 10 miles in a day, without your heart rate reaching an ‚Äúactive state‚Äù they WILL NOT COUNT IT. Which of course left me with a LOT of calories burned that weren‚Äôt counting on the app so after logging my meals for the day it would turn red and say I‚Äôve eaten over my goal, when in fact I had been eating at too high of a deficit. This is dangerous to eat at too high of a deficit and therefore I find the tracking hazardous. You read that right. You will put your health at risk if you trust this apps calculations. I use a Garmin Venu which displays my active and inactive calories burned. Many other health trackers show this as well. Proceed with caution using this app.","Hi,"

Also there are only 4 meals, I wish I could customize the meal number or like in MyFitnessPal it gives pre workout meal plus 5 meals.

Really?!  Then please update your app description because this was very misleading.  No sooner did I enter my email, the app asked me to choose if I wanted the ‚ÄúLimited‚Äù option with calorie tracker only, or if I wanted to pay the $30 a year for the Pro Features (everything worthwhile...).

Entering food into this app can be very annoying. The spinners will rest the row over if you don‚Äôt make sections in just the right order. The conversions for different measurements are often completely in accurate. For example 2 oz of something instead of a table spoon can result in wildly different numbers of calories and carbs. There are also a lot of bad and inaccurate items in the library so you are better off just entering all your own custom nutritional info.

I meal prep and used leftovers and the meal plans all have a completely different meal 3times a day. Nothing that feeds into another meal to save money or time. Also I eat many foods from Whole Foods and almost every time I‚Äôve gone to log I need to create the food. It doesn‚Äôt recognize the barcodes. I just don‚Äôt log or try to find something close to save time. This isn‚Äôt the meal tracking app for my personal needs.,

The meals are ridiculous with recipes that require ingredients 80% of the people won‚Äôt have in their refrigerator or spice rack.  Some recipes even require something called a hokkaido pumpkin.

Do you really want to go to the grocery and buy things for these silly recipes for 1 serving everytime?  Who has time for that.  Bottomline, incorporate more than half of veggies into your meal, avoid sugar best you can.  Eat smaller portions, don‚Äôt over indulge unless its veggies only.  You will lose weight by following this simple plan.","Hi! If you can't find Hokkaido, we would suggest Butternut squash (although its a bit sweeter) and unlike the Hokkaido, it would be best to remove the skin because it takes longer to cook than the Hokkaido skin.

The food database is the smallest by far so I find myself having to add food more often than not. On top of that, the foods that are in the database almost always have incorrect serving / portion sizes. This may be because the interface for entering a new food is really weird and bad. It seems impossible to have the app understand what a serving is. And, if you enter one incorrectly (due to the bad interface, probably) and make it public, there is no option at all to edit or remove it.",

One thing, that I really like - you can add your personal meal to the list. But it has its negative side. There're soooo many similar options to choose from with different numbers of kcal and etc. that I can't choose any, because I don't know which of them is right. I understand that they are added by users, but can you actually add a filter or something like that to delete unnecessary stuff ? That'd be such a relief.",

533,5,2016-12-10T01:13:40.000Z,Mypenny44,"Great app, BUT....","I've downloaded and tested several food tracking apps and this was by far my favorite for someone who tracks macros and weighs their food out in grams.  The only issue I've noticed is that when setting goals for carbs, protein and fat, the amounts do not equal up to the calorie amount intended and you can't fix it because according to the app it doesn't equal 100% but it actually does.  For example my carbs are set to 192g which is 768 calories (4calories per gram) but that app displays that as being 785 calories.  Another thing is I wish that you were able to revise a food that you create. If you enter the incorrect information accidentally and complete the added food you can't go in to edit your mistake, you have to create a new item.",
534,3,2017-06-19T13:58:06.000Z,Ron1981,Inaccurate with everything,"I was hoping to buy the pro features and get rid of MyFitnessPal for a more custom experience but..... for one, the barcode scanner never finds my item, I have to go find it manually through search and when I do find it, the calories, carbs, protein on YAZIO is very different (higher) the actual box for the exact weight of the product. You can't edit anything of course so if I follow YAZIO, I will exceed a calorie goal much faster in the app. With dieting and fitness, one of the worst things is inaccuracy. Back to MyFitnessPal.",

537,2,2017-06-30T23:10:16.000Z,Sarah2124096,Logging is awful,"The food database is small, and adding foods is painful and likely leads to the inaccuracies other users have complained of. I tried to log a bagel first thing. It wasn't in the database, even though it was from a huge chain with easily accessible nutrition info. To add it, I had to categorize it (either a bread or a roll, imo), enter its mass, and input its macro- and micronutrients. Micronutrients included both salt and sodium (!), which had to be entered in units of grams (!!), and the usual complement of vitamins, minerals, and metals, which had to be entered in mg (!!!). These are ludicrous choices that make one wonder how knowledgeable the app builders are. They also ensure that user-input foods will essentially all have inaccurate data, since people are unlikely to put in the effort to get everything in the units the app wants.",

I‚Äôve tried a handful of recipes and they are not bad just needed ingredients I do not typically have. The app has a barcode scanner which is helpful , however the information often contradicts itself. Particularly in the quantity/ calorie area. Annoying but you can sort of figure it out I just feel I shouldn‚Äôt have to. The epic fail of the program is the inability to get real information on your vitamin and mineral intake. I take supplements, the app reads the barcode no problem, but DOES NOT add the ingredients to your list. So what is the point? A terrible flaw which I had to pay money to find out.

I looked around the app thinking maybe the pro subscription would be beneficial, but I was wrong. The pro subscription is something you could get on another app for free, so I contacted the app‚Äôs support to try to get a refund. The company replied saying that I had made a binding contract with them, so they couldn‚Äôt refund my accidental purchase. The response from customer service was also very automated, I doubt a living person actually read my concern. Anyway, I‚Äôm upset that I paid 30 whole dollars for nothing special.

Everything seems to only be added in oz increments. For example, if I want to add one egg, it doesn‚Äôt have an option to add one egg, just ozs. Even when their food database has the item, say a single serve packaged item, you can‚Äôt just add one package, you have to figure out the ozs. I really wish I hadn‚Äôt wasted the $29.99 on the year premium subscription.","Hi, thank you for your message! We are sorry that you are unsatisfied with the app."
