0,3,2020-05-12T16:40:25.000Z,Dawwzyy,Needs language preference,Not sure what language it is but I’m using a translator & it’s kinda harder for me to use. I think I will be using it temporary for now & might remove it. This will be my last source of app to check,
1,1,2021-01-02T00:34:35.000Z,Amandacrts,HORRIBLE AND GLITCHY,"This app is terrible and I wish I could get a refund for my purchase on it. There are still ads after I paid for them to go away, I keep getting logged out and the the app won’t remember me, and it can’t find most of the foods that I search for, and also why is it partially in English and partially in another language?? Stupid. Don’t waste your time or money on this app.",
2,2,2021-02-01T13:51:27.000Z,Aruna2021,Too incomplete,"The app has a mix of languages, and doesn't have a language selection option.  All food items have the same write up.  I would not recommend it.",
3,1,2021-07-06T17:58:05.000Z,CowGoddess,Too rough on the edges to bother using,"As has been noted, it has a mix of English and French on the buttons. Not a huge source of products. Several screens don’t have a visible back button or home button. Sometimes the arrow is there but the font is white and it is on a white part of the background image. Latest Os, iPhone 8.",
4,1,2020-01-26T01:16:03.000Z,Jackie;),French and English mixed,This app has French and English mixed throughout the app. An add pops up before every answer. The search bar doesn’t quit work. You can’t just type and push enter like normal. You must select one of their recommendations. Even if that recommendation is exactly what you typed in.,Hi
5,1,2020-06-11T21:42:05.000Z,jajgroth,Language,I can’t understand what the app is saying. I speak English. This is some other language. The app doesn’t let you change the language either. Useless app. Deleting,"Hello,"
