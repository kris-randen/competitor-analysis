0,5,2020-05-08T23:23:49.000Z,Siouxzee44,Where is support?,"I looked for a way to ask support in the app but couldn’t find a place to do so. I’ve been a member for quite a while now. It’s by far the best carb tracking app that I’ve found and I’ve tried 5 or 6 of them. I keep coming back here. I pay for premium even. However I’m really frustrated. I’m having a hard time entering recipes. After I get all the info typed in there is many times no “save” option. I have to click the upper right corner to get out of the screen and so lose everything I’m trying to save. I try to refresh the screen, I poke around at the top of the screen (where it’s just white space), I clear out the food search history - nothing.  It’s hard enough for me to be faithful in tracking and with things like this happening quite often I’d rather just quit. This needs to be fixed. I’ve invested enough time and money with this app that I don’t want to throw in the towel, but this is annoying!!  The other annoyance is if I make a typo I can’t correct it or add a word in the middle of a line without completely starting over. The cursor automatically takes me to the end of the sentence. E.g if I want “ground cinnamon” and I forget to type ground or if I type grnd I can’t just jump in to correct it, I have to erase the entire line and start over. SO annoying. Each extra keystroke takes time that I don’t want to devote to tracking. I need it to be easy!  I love the scan feature. I wish all ingredients could be scanned.","Hi there, thanks for contacting us and for using Carb Manager! Our friendly support team would be delighted to assist you with your questions.

1,5,2021-01-27T21:16:38.000Z,madabouthouse,An amazing tool,"I have had a great experience using this app. It’s easy to use, and is on my cell phone — so, I can update or edit my food intake and track my protein, carb, fat, and calorie intake through out the day. It has been easy to find and match the foods that I eat which makes it easy to be accurate and personalized about my exact food intake. It’s also very user friendly vehicle so it allows me to easily see if a particular food that I may be consider for consumption will fit into the limits/goals — that I’ve intentionally chosen for myself since it has a display panel that shows the maximum amount of calories, proteins, carbs, and fats that I’ve decided to consume daily. I am currently using this as a weight loss tool because, I unfortunately had put on 30lbs during the current Covid worldwide pandemic. I’m excited to say that I’ve already lost 7lbs is just 10 days. I have lost this weight without starving myself at all. I can also track my activities, exercising, and water intake too. I can’t wait to continue — and I plan to loose all my covid weight gain. I plan to use this app even after I reach my goal weight — because, my body thrives on a moderate calorie, low carb, high protein diet that incorporates good fats. I love how the program has notations about keto friendly foods. I also hope to eventually use the many great recipes that are linked to this site. Hip hip hooray to the help that this app offers with regard to healthy eating. Thank you!",
2,5,2019-10-09T16:55:03.000Z,BIRD1E-1111,Great tool for a Keto Diet!,I love this because you can track all of your macros quickly and easily. I love the ability to scan UPC codes to enter a new product. I love how you can enter recipes by entering a url. There are tons of recipes and you can edit recipes to suit your needs. There are meal plans included in the premium version but none of them suit my needs. They should be labeled differently than meal plan 1 etc so we do not have to look through each one. You can customize a meal plan which is great but it did not work for me. I entered “no seafood “ and it gave me only 1 choice for lunch which was an Asian salmon salad.,
3,4,2021-01-31T06:47:51.000Z,Charlie2427,Really liking the revamp,"I looked at carb manager before the Regan and just couldn’t get into it. I really like what they have done, you can tell that they put a lot of thought and hard work into their new and improved app. I love how easy it is to enter foods the barcode scanner has worked crazy fast for me with everything I’ve scanned so far. There’s tons of metrics you can teac track which is a huge plus for me because now I can have it all in one app instead of flipping through 3 like I did before. I can enter my blood glucose & ketone readings and it calculates my GKI. I can keep track of my body measurements to see how I’m progressing over time along with my weight. There’s just so much! It’s great. There are some bugs that still need to be worked out and crashing on the build a meal plan portion. I also wish that you didn’t have to pick a date to start your meal plan or so much food before moving on to the next step. The social aspect is nice, because it’s always enjoyable to run ideas past others on the same journey. Also the fact that they have recipes in app is awesome. Though I wish there was a dedicated spot for favorited recipes and the ability to create a shopping list from the favorites. I mean if we can make a meal plan shopping list why not make that feature available too. All in all this has been the perfect app for me. I hope they keep with these great improvements. Subbed to premium I liked everything so much.",
4,5,2020-05-19T23:37:11.000Z,sschof86,Makes it easy to track and instill habits !,"I recently made the decision to try the keto diet. Many friends swear by it, and I see how people with epilepsy May benefit from it. As someone with epilepsy I decided to give it a go and see all the hype not tracking anything at first and I definitely felt like I needed something to keep me accountable and on track. I tried another app, but they only let you log 5 things in the free version before you must pay. For someone trying it out and trying keto I don’t want to pay especially in the beginning.",
5,5,2018-11-07T12:42:17.000Z,mpjinnj,5-stars if you’re ready to upgrade to Premium,"Carb Manager has been a wonderfully useful app for me. The interface is extremely user friendly, it has great visuals that keep it from looking bland (as food tracking often feels for me), and I love the level of customization of goals and amount of pre-built recommendations available. While Carb Manager sounds like it’s designed for Keto diets, it actually works great for more traditional diet plans, as well (ie Zone, Body Building, etc). I use it for Low-Carb, High-Fat that was recommended by my doctor (not as carb restrictive as Keto), and it had that option pre-built, as well.",
6,4,2020-02-13T00:53:38.000Z,SashaP82,"Great! Just one wish, to save shared recipes.","I’ve just converted to a Keto lifestyle, I tried a few apps and CarbManager has the best features while using the free version of the app. Thank You!!! I truly believe I can eat whatever my heart desires twisted to Keto, in that frame of mind I am always creating new recipes. In the last 4 days of having the app, I have created and added 4 of them. I love that it totals up all the nutritional values and when I add it to my daily food, let’s say as my dinner, those adjust to the serving size. I cook for a very large household and since a few of us are trying to stick to Keto friendly meals it’s nice to be able to share the recipes, however, they can’t save them so that they can benefit from the same nutritional information in their daily meal records. That means each app user has to create the recipe in their app, that’s quite frustrating. I’m hoping there is a way to update this, it maybe I am just saving wrong. I always give permission to publish when I create a new recipe, the little box is checked. I’m guessing it just takes a while to verify each one of those before they are published, which is understandable, but if we all had my invented dish for dinner then we would all like to have the benefit of just adding it once shared from the app, which is another feature I love! Thanks again for the great work!!!",
7,4,2018-09-25T19:01:49.000Z,quietlyobvious,Great App But Needs Tweaks,"I found this app last week and really enjoy using it. It easily helps me keep track of my macros and lets me see what I’m eating and where I can improve. That being said, there are a couple issues that reduce the user-friendliness of this app. First, you cannot enter your own recipe and save it. This is a great feature of the Weight Watchers app that I was hoping this one had. I can import a recipe from online, but I haven’t seen where I can create my own recipe and save it. Instead, I have to individually list each item (in let’s say homemade salad dressing), and there is no option to copy multiple ingredients from one day to the next. So even though I drink the same Keto coffee or eat leftovers for lunch from dinner the night before, I have to painstakingly copy each ingredient one by one. If I could just simply copy each one, that would be great, but instead the app flips you to the current day after selecting the meal time to place the copied ingredient. Right now I’m trying to copy certain ingredients from Sunday’s dinner to Monday’s lunch, and each time I select an ingredient to copy, I get reverted back to today, then have to back arrow twice to Sunday, scroll down, and copy the next item. It’s time consuming and tedious and really the only thing I would say should be fixed to make the app more user-friendly and efficient.","Hi there, thanks so much for contacting us, and glad you are enjoying the app! To answer your questions: to add a custom recipe, please go to Foods > My Foods > Recipes. Tap the + Add New Recipe button to get started. To copy multiple food items from one day to the next, tap on the ... button next to either the food item or the meal header in the Daily Log and select Copy To... You can also copy an entire day's foods by finding the Copy To... button at the bottom of the Daily Log page. Premium users can also create a meal, which allows you to easily assemble foods together to log with one tap. Hope this helps!"
8,4,2018-01-16T17:09:29.000Z,Mark Wagner,Best NET CARB Nutrition App,"(Update) Still the best app for tracking nutrition especially for calculating net carbs. However, the app is a little buggy at times which is usually easily remedied by closing the app and reopening; however, it’s inconvenient. That said, this app is still my favorite and is very well designed and targeted towards net carb calculation and tracking. The application interface and design is still the best out there.","Hi Mark, thanks so much for the feedback and for the great review! We're delighted that you're loving Carb Manager. (Another update - 1/28) We implemented some additional changes on the server that should make loading even faster now. You should start noticing the improvements today.

9,4,2021-03-27T05:06:09.000Z,puppywhispers,Finally! An app that actually works.,"Learning to eat clean is difficult, because boredom of the same foods can be a problem. The recipes help, but they should all be free. The per servings when creating food items is confusing at times. The preset food nutritional information when created by users, are sometimes misleading, there should be a way for the app to verify the carb, fat, protein and calorie intake.  I would also caution verifying the amount of calories burned during exercises that are entered by users. I also wish there was a way to convert per servings of a meal more accurate, although this app helped me lose 21 pounds in a month.  Note: I stopped all intake of soda, after this app calculated the nutritional value, and showed me the macros for soda.  I drank soda for 30 plus years. I would recommend a low carb, low fat, low calorie, high protein shopping list for beginners to print or download for shopping...it can be overwhelming getting started. Also, recommend incorporating shopping list with recipes, makes it easier to get started.  Lastly, incorporating nutritional information with the grocery list would also help beginners do their shopping.  Getting started was confusing, but out of all the apps, this one has helped me best.",
10,5,2017-10-09T16:18:06.000Z,Rev.Trev,Loving it!,"I have tried multiple diets and multiple apps but this app is by far the easiest. It generates with nice visuals the percentages of everything you're eating and it's very user friendly. I started my modified Keto diet about 2 weeks ago and was dreading creating a meal plan and logging it but this app makes it so easy, I've already lost more weight than I anticipated.",
11,5,2018-07-18T21:22:09.000Z,katie lynn CD,Pleasantly surprised,I’ve had the two major calorie trackers for years which I found helpful but they never really aligned with my specific goals- just made me anxious about calorie counting and did not help shape a healthy relationship with food. I’m trying to get away from calorie counting and just stick to low carb as I just believe our calorie counting culture is unhealthy (especially for women) but I do think being mindful of nutrition is super important.,
12,5,2018-10-16T16:59:38.000Z,Jgil1970,Easiest to use for LCHF,"I’ve been using the app daily for more than 7 months now.  I’m down 58lbs, and I think carb manager has helped me stay on track.  It’s easy to use, and provides all the information I need. I have the premium so I can also track my micronutrients.  (Electrolytes!) The free version works as well, so there’s no need to purchase the premium version.",
13,4,2019-05-18T03:55:05.000Z,neeeeeed a nickkkkname,Needs fine-tuning,"This app works really well overall for tracking your diet.  However, there are a few annoying things that would be pretty easy for the app developers to fix. 1) please include an option for GRAMS for every ingredient! Even if it’s a liquid!!...Weighing ingredients is preferred for many of us tracking our macros. 2) When you click to add an ingredient/food, it gives you a list of items you commonly use. This is nice, but if you can’t find the item on the list, and you start to type in the item’s name, the commonly used ingredients don’t show up! Please make it so that items you commonly use show up when you start to do a typing search. 3) There are some issues with some food items not having amount options, and the only option is to choose the number of servings, and it doesn’t show how much a serving is.  This is probably due to the user not entering in all of the packaging information when they enter the item.  The problem is that subsequent users do not have to way to modify the product Information to make it useable.  Those are the main annoying issues I’ve come across while using this otherwise great app.",
14,4,2021-07-18T05:35:36.000Z,IT has Crystal,"Amazing app, needs more food entry options","I’ve had this app for years, and it keeps improving. I love how the app provides a prediction for when you will reach your weight goal with the calorie deficit that you set. I also love how you can set your own macro goals or diet goals (like keto, protein, etc). You can also track your sleep, water, and exercise, and choose whether your exercise automatically subtracts calories from your daily calorie goal or not. Also, very easy to use app with a great overall look and cute congrats animations. I think the only downside that I can think of, is that there needs to be more food entry options. When I did Keto, I didn’t have any problem entering in what I ate, but for foods that don’t fit into the keto focus, often you have to just enter ingredients… which is inconvenient and time-consuming. For example, if I were to try to enter a s’mores, I would have to put the three ingredients because there is no s’more entry. Or even something more custom, like a kale salad topped with grilled chicken, tomatoes, and ranch. It would be smart to have a base salad option for this for example, where you could customize it, like you do when you order at a Panera or McDonald’s kiosk. Just an idea :) Otherwise, I love this app.",

17,1,2019-08-20T10:54:05.000Z,Bonito apps,Not registering intake?,"I just entered my “breakfast“ on another popular app, and it told me that 1 teaspoon of braggs apple cider vinegar and 2 teaspoons of Metamucil sugar-free registers as 40 caliries and 10g carbs.  I enter the same two items on this app, and it registers 0 calories and 0 carbs of any kind, total or net or anything. What am I supposed to make of this?  Does this app realize I ate at least something, and that this something does have at least calories, or not?? Also very difficult to navigate this app, as just trying to select how many teaspoons of something results in having to fudge with selecting the actual number of teaspoons and then the teaspoon/tablespoon selection itself, but there’s always this weird looking half bent number on the wheels above where are you need to line up those selections just so, so it appears that after you make all your selections, there is always something above and below it, and I don’t think there should be anything above it, zero. It’s very confusing. Additionally, it took me 15 minutes to figure out what to do after I got those numbers lined up… Eventually I wound up tapping where there is a checkmark in the green bar and that seem to make the selections “take“ And register in the daily food consumption list. It really should say something like enter or add or something, because it took me so long to figure this out.  I’m not a fan of this interface.","Hello and thank you for contacting Carb Manager support. We're sorry to hear that you've encountered some issues logging meals with Carb Manager.

18,5,2021-01-21T16:05:05.000Z,Titanpower1,Easy Breezy App,"Carb manager has made it so easy to calculate my macros for keto meals and edit all through the day, even has the option to take some of the prepared recipes and change an ingredient that recalculates the macros for you. This app has so many good tasting and variety of recipes that makes meal planning so easy. As long as I have the keto staples, I’m able to change to another recipe at the last minute to something else that I’m craving without falling behind on meeting my daily macro goals. I’m so glad I subscribed to the premium membership. Best part I was offered a discounted cost and glad I accepted the opportunity given to me. It’s all worth it. I don’t think I can do without carb manager now. I’m addicted to this app. So easy to count macros and look up my next delicious meal to prepare right there at my fingertips on my cell phone. Where ever I am I have easy access to view, add, subtract macros and ensure I have what I need to prepare a new recipe in case I need to make a grocery run while I’m out.

The scan feature allows me to quickly add foods using the barcode on the product; then it calculates based on portion size you choose so you know EXACTLY what you’re putting in your body!  There is also an incredibly extensive quick search that has EVERYTHING you could eat in it!  The goals feature allows you to set your daily goals, then helps you track how the goods you eat add up to your goal totals.  I started this diet plan one week ago; I’ve been measuring my ketones daily and achieved mild ketosis on day three, and full ketosis on day six!!  I keep to a 20 gm carb restriction, and 1500 calories.  I have to say I feel GREAT!  I didn’t get anywhere near my 1500 calories today, and I don’t feel hungry!!  I have great energy, I sleep great and wake up ready to tackle my day!  Toss us the best I’ve felt in YEARS!!  I’m 39, with two kids, and excited that THIS IS WORKING!

The Scanner, unlike other apps hasn't missed a single item I have tried which ensures everything I want to track is counted precisely.   Getting into a Keto Diet can be a little confusing to figure out the percentages of foods, but no more. With Carb Manager, you have a simple to read Pie chart or circle graph with your daily values just to the right.   If you eat similar foods everyday there are multiple ways for you to bring them over to the current day.  I use the copy to command all the time.  It works for single items or entire meals.   The free version does everything I need, but because it works so well, I am going to buy the premium service so I can integrate it with my exercise goals and take advantage of the devices, get recipe ideas, meal planners and shopping lists.  One last note. This app syncs with a web page so you can also use your computer to do the same stuff as your smart phone.  5 stars.   My health thanks you!!",
21,1,2019-01-16T19:41:20.000Z,Ontological Unicorn,Upgraded version of app has become unusable,"Have used the app for years, spending hours over time adding custom foods, nutritional info, etc. Upgraded to the new app, and when prompted for a login, the screen said existing data would be transferred over to new app. It wasn’t. Original requests for help finally got a reply of “just start using the new version and we’ll see what we can do. New requests for help with still-not transferred data have not been answered. I started trying to re-add foods, and really appreciate the barcode scan feature, which should save heaps of time entering info. Except some of it doesn’t match at all what’s listed on the nutrition info panel on the package. Multiple efforts to update info let me edit values, but then doesn’t save them, so only records in the daily log the wrong info/values. Totally frustrating waste of time. New version is not at all intuitive as previous version was. Am giving up on this app, as I can no longer use it to accurately capture macro nutrient counts or edit incorrect info or regain any of the info or progress data  I had previously entered over 4+ years. It’s a great idea and served me very well for a few years, but new version needs some improvement for accuracy, usability, and support.",

It helped me purge what I had in the house, took a bit of entering all the items in the app, but the effort was worth it. Not only did it tell me what was in the food, but more importantly to me, made me conscious of what I HAVE been eating and what goes in my body now is in the front of my mind. Especially that I’m not getting younger... I’ve used this app for just over a week now, and have already lost 5 lbs, have not touched a weight, walk, treadmill, any sort of cardio, and I feel great! (A little help from a friend, take a couple of shots of pickle juice each day the first week, sounds weird, and bathroom visits, but it works and is worth it!!!) I’m not at the point where I want to pay for the extra, but the basic free app is well worth it to be more conscious of what to eat and what not to eat. Recommend it if your not very ‘food savvy’ of what macros are in the food you eat.",
23,4,2019-04-14T15:56:31.000Z,Tdb77,Nice app but confusing,I was referred by a friend to use this app and I’ve been using it for a month now. Some of the foods are confusing; for example eggs = 1 carb. I’ve looked at all the eggs sold at my local chain supermarket and none of them have carbs. 🤨,
24,3,2020-08-28T16:00:56.000Z,Elaina-Jaide,Has potential but not quite there yet,This app seems old and clunky compared to myfitnesspal and lose it.  The interface feels really old. Also I’m visually impaired and there is no dark mode to make things easier to see. That needs to be implemented for free as not everyone can see tiny writing in lightly colored font. I hate that developers never test their stuff to see if it’s easily accessible for those with less than perfect vision.  As a developer you should always err on the side of making the background dark and the font larger to accommodate for everyone!  I shouldn’t have to ask to be able to see the app like everyone else. One thing I like is that Carb Manager has most foods when I scan a barcode. I use more than one app as I like to compare them all.  Please take some time to make this app look more modern and include more features like LOSEIT and Myfitnesspal. Carb manager has virtually no competition as no other apps really focus on the low carb/keto lifestyle and you would get more premium subscribers if you added more features and accessibility to the app. Not sure if premium is worth it  for me,"Thanks so much for the constructive feedback!.

Gives you a grade, for example, if you input something that is not Keto friendly, it will give you a grade F (avoid). For us newbies on Keto this is a great tool to have on an app. Also able to track water intake, as well as your Exercise, cardio, weights. Also tracks ones weight and body measurements.

And I love the recipes that are available. So far, I have made the Turkey Chili which was just wonder, I also made the Turkey Loaf, the chia pudding. If you are serious about losing weight, carb manager will get you there. I have lost 25 pounds since May of this year. You have to put some effort in and exercise which I consider now  a plus benefit. This time last year I had so much arthritic pain that I  could barely walk. I am walking now independently (no more cane), no more gout pain and no more arthritic pain. I attributed most of that arthritic pain to the high sugar intake (candy, cookies, doughnuts). My feet and ankles were always swollen due the high intake of salty snacks. My BP is down. My doctor has taken me off Lasix and several other pills. Now I am down to 1/2 tab of BP meds and 1 cholesterol tab. I feel great physically and emotionally. Now I look forward to preparing my meals and exercising daily.",
28,3,2021-02-14T21:06:04.000Z,McKittrick5,Updated version is not as good or intuitive as the last.,"We’ve been keto for 3/4 year. Been tracking the last few months to get back to deep ketosis for medical reasons. I like to know my macro breakdowns per meal (two meals a day) and before I could flip my phone sideways to see how much protein and fat at each meal and which foods had how much (learning so I don’t have to track forever.) with the new and improved app, I can’t do this from my phone and but have to use the computer which is inconvenient. It only shows calories and carbs. It’s also harder to do the recipes. It’s annoying to have to save a recipe you are trying to make, and then go back and find it to see how the macros pan out, then go back and change it and continue the process until it is how you want it. (Some recipes are too low or high in fat or carbs and a few substitutes need to be made.) A continuous tally available while making the recipe would be nice. It works ok for keeping track but definitely has weak spots for anyone who wants to use it on a continuous basis. I wonder if the developers tried using it for a day in their own lives before launching? 🤔",

I picked it up again recently, and thought they’d broken it, it was sooo different. But very quickly I came to love the changes. It’s intuitive, adds information quickly, has a few cool new features like muli-add, etc., it was improved.",
30,2,2019-01-10T08:27:56.000Z,Nebs1124,No free recipes..but it looks nice.,"They say they offer free recipes but they don't, they only give recipes for the premium. And if they DO have free recipes then there is no way to actually tell which recipes are for premium and which are for free unless you tap on them. Also, when you click on the “search for a recipe” button, they give you a bunch of premium recipes on the front page so you’ll be scrolling for hours tapping and trying to find one for free which you probably wont be able to do. They have a search option, but no filters to go through either for the picky eats who are on a budget and looking for a quick recipe that a two year old would eat.","Thanks for the feedback! The recipes do require a subscription, but the macros tracking components are all free, and you can create your own recipes for free.  We do have a recipe filter feature. Please go to Foods > Recipes & Meal Plans > Search Recipes and tap the down arrow button next to the search field to see the filtering options."

The app also synchs with Fitbit and other devices.....Plus there are tasty keto recipes.😋",
32,5,2020-06-27T23:27:05.000Z,mgs1959,Hooray for Carb Manager!,"I’m a 60-year-old male, recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes with high blood pressure and sleep apnea. I’ve been obese for more than 25 years. I’m now under the care of a weight loss doctor who mandated that I use the Carb Manager app. I was apprehensive about logging my meals and snacks at first, but I actually enjoy planning and tracking what I eat. And I’m losing weight. 2 years ago I weighed 300 pounds. I managed to lose about 30 pounds and lower my A1-c score from 6.4 to 5.9, but gained 10 pounds during the COVID-19 shutdown and my A1-C spiked to 6.5. Working with my new doctor and using Carb Manager, I’m confident I will stay on track and meet my weight loss goal, lower my blood pressure and mitigate my sleep apnea over time. I weighed 261 pounds today and have lost about 15 pounds in 6 weeks. I love this app and I look forward to recording my meals/foods/drinks for the first time in my life. My goal weight is 175 pounds but I will be happy with 190. I’m 5’11” tall with a large frame. Thanks Carb Manager!",
33,3,2021-01-07T19:20:12.000Z,Winter'sWife,Premium recipe?,I was previously using MyFitnessPal to track my food but it didn’t show carbs unless I subscribed to premium. So I found this app specifically for keto! How cool! I created an account and started to log my daily food and realize I can’t log my lunch because it’s “premium recipe”... I know EVERY stupid app makes you pay for features that slightly improve use or enjoyment. But making people subscribe simply to WRITE DOWN a food item is ridiculous. I know most that will read this comment will just say “it’s only 8 bucks a month just subscribe.” But honestly EVERY dollar counts to me right now and I can’t. I’m trying to better my life and lose a lot of weight to stay healthy for my husband and I to hopefully have a child soon. I can’t afford to sub. So I guess I’ll just pick some other food item that’s similar even though it’s asinine to even have to. This isn’t FarmVille or some game people spend money on for extra loot chests or whatever. It’s a life management app and I just want to watch my carbs in one place without being harassed to buy yet another monthly subscription to something.,
34,2,2019-09-19T17:19:12.000Z,snobabe,Dishonest pricing,"I had been using carb manager for a few months. I love it for tracking net carbs and finding out new recipes from other users. It would remind me daily about premium for $40 a year. I thought about it but figured I didn’t need it since I only was using it primarily for tracking net carbs. That was until I got a Fitbit. Which to sync it I needed to buy into the premium. I sucked it up to buy it. Which it a equivalent of 4 hours of my work day. Part of syncing you need to go into the site. Imagine my delight to find out just a matter of 10-30 second after purchasing it on the app and switching to online I was offered it for $30. Wait I just paid $40 for it.... so why offer the discount AFTER I paid for it? I figured I would reach out to costumer service. Joke! They won’t offer a refund of $10 due to inconvenience. They said they don’t offer the discount even if it was shown right after it was paid for.🙄. I am a manager in costumer service and let me tell you, that is not how you treat a costumer. I will be calling my bank to tell them to make sure the $40 gets cancelled. Along with forwarding this review to apple and Fitbit.",
35,5,2020-10-03T17:00:39.000Z,Luna803,I’m finally really doing keto,I am thrilled with this app.  I have tried keto on my own and have never succeeded. I would cut out what I thought I was supposed to be cutting out and I would not feel any better and I would not lose any weight. I have been using Carb Manager for about two weeks now and I know I’ve already lost 10 pounds. I started out at 234 lbs. I think I’ve lost more but it’s not time for me to weigh yet. I have no complaints about this app. It took a little bit to learn all the different things about the app but I have been able to figure it all out without any help.    I finally understand the whole macro thing! This is what has been missing. I still had a mindset about fat.  I’m 55 years old so I’ve had a lot of years of hearing that fat is bad fat is bad.  I am doing great and I’m having plenty of food to eat and I’m never starving in fact I don’t even feel hungry I just get shaky.  Thank you so very much for this app. It is changing my life!,

I don’t usually care enough about something to leave a review, good or bad. But this app does everything I need it to. I have to be extremely careful with my carbs for blood sugar’s sake. It is so nice to be able to see my day at a glance, and note my trends over time. You can do this with almost any app, but the difference here is the EASE. It is so easy to use! I love being able to copy my meals to different days. It does all of the nice things my fitness pal does, I.e. save frequent meals and recipes, give you your macro breakdown, set goals, PLUS it has education, it has meal ideas, and you can log blood sugar and other similar things (like keto readings). Other fitness apps takes ages to log meals, are glitchy. And the layout of things is confusing or at least usually is to me. This is the most user friendly app I’ve come across. Of all the ones I’ve tried, this one is the best!",

It’s worth it and to get the most out of the app and your goals, I highly recommend purchasing vs the free usage where you are limited. The intuitiveness and features of what I can do has surpassed a lot of other apps I’ve tried to use. I can track what I need to track based on my individual goals (macros), track exercise (just recently connected to my Apple Watch, so hopeful of that), look up recipes with instructions, log food with an extensive database to choose from (have yet to find something not already in the database!), etc. This app has instructions on how to perform exercises you may not be familiar with, videos on how to prepare a recipe, etc. This app does it all and the developers took everything into account. Definitely recommend! This is also the first review I’ve done on an app...it’s just that good.",
38,3,2021-02-20T02:40:51.000Z,TasaPNW,Clunky update,"As a Type II diabetic I like using Carb Manager as it’s helped me focus on my carb intake. I liked it so much that I switched from using My Fitness Pal, and even paid for a premium subscription. Now, with this so-called update, I’m about to switch back to MFP, since CM has become so annoying to use. There many things that I don’t like about the update, but I’ll start with the main ones :1) slow and faulty load - every time I launch the app, it grinds away trying to open until I get the message to try again! As soon as I tap that message, it launches almost immediately. This is not an internet or WiFi problem, it’s solely a glitch in the app. 2) you must manually scroll back up to the top of the page, as there’s no function to just tap on the top margin to have it automatically jump to the top. Very annoying and time consuming. 3) having to do a fresh search for items I’ve logged in many times, again, slow, cumbersome and time consuming! That’s just a start.  Hope these issues get fixed soon, or I’m gone!",

I told myself I would not upgrade to Premium on this app until I had used it for a few days in the free setting.  After just one evening of checking out if the entry would be fast, if the app was easy to navigate, and if the resulting information offered was meaningful and easily understood, I purchased Premium for one year.  I was that impressed!",

For example, I have 4 net carbs left and I want to see like a list of foods I can eat with 4 carbs or less or may be type in 4 g net carbs and I will be able to see a list of the foods with those carbs with the amounts.","Hi there, thanks for contacting us and for the feedback!

43,5,2019-04-28T13:10:26.000Z,Nyla's iPad2,"Great app, but not perfect.","This is by far the best food tracking app I’ve ever used and the yearly subscription is worth every penny.  This app makes finding what you need practically effortless.  The data base is massive, plus if you are having trouble finding a listing, you can scan the product’s barcode—including many supplements! You can also add your own favorite recipes as well as finding new recipes in the database.",
44,3,2021-04-19T19:05:31.000Z,Omakad,Great tool but no IF timer.,"After reading some reviews between different apps I decided to go with CM but after signing up I was surprised to find out that this app doesn’t include intermittent fasting timer, goals, or historical tracking. It’s even advertised as easy IF tracking but this only includes time stamps of when the food was entered.  Many other free apps include this option.  It’s a huge omission considering that many keto people also do IF. After doing some more research I see that this function is coming in future updates but it seems it’s been coming for months so I’m not holding my breath. Secondly it would be nice if premium subscription included some kind of the Milne support or support phone number. If you are not doing IF than you don’t have much to loose investing $9 or $3 per month in yourself and your health. If you can pay for Netflix you can pay for this and support these guys. It would be nice if developers could give us some timeline on when this IF timer will actually become available.",
45,5,2020-11-29T12:21:11.000Z,Lkirby,Great for Keto,"I’ve been using this app for almost a year now and I love it. If you can do the premium version, it’s well worth it. Makes meal planning and finding new keto-friendly foods and meals super easy. I find it easier to hold myself accountable if I have visuals and I love the circle graph on this platform. Makes it easy to keep yourself in check. I went for part of the year with the free version, which is awesome on its own, but I prefer the paid version. It helps me track  all of my body measurements and food all in one convenient place and it syncs with apple health. Even if you’re not doing keto, this is a great app. I’ve used so many food trackers in the past (my fitness pal, weight watchers, lose it, etc) and this by far my favorite!!! Before paying for the premium service again, I tried out all of those apps again and even their premium versions don’t offer what this app has. Definitely worth it!!!",

However, there are a couple issues with it that can be very frustrating. First - the search function is fair at best. Sometimes it works and sometimes the items it brings up are not even close to what is being searched for. If I want to add an avocado to my meal sometimes I can type ‘avo’ and the search brings up avocado with no problem. Other times I can type the entire word and still not get a single hit on avocado. Second - it’s great that members can add recipes but there is no control over the content, so all the member recipes and foods sometimes get in the way. I would like to have the ability to filter them out. For example, there are many recipes with no ingredients at all. These things just clutter up the search even more. I pay for this app, and I plan to stick with it. Maybe future updates fix some minor irritations.",
48,5,2021-04-07T00:08:57.000Z,SpectoralBladesOP,App does literally everything,"As an absolute NEW COMER to anything diet related .. I found this app literally guiding my decisions. Before I shove anything (food) in my mouth - I punch said food in the app- and find out how many carbs/ fat/ protein etc. I lost 30 lbs - literally by doing this. Could not be simpler. Do a little research - Decide what macros you want to use- For is we went Keto- which is a percentage of net carbs/ protein / fat- pick your macros from drop down menu- enter your weight - Click enter and you’re off and running. Input what you eat- and this app does the math and tells how many Net Carbs remaining for the day-  Calories, protein , fat etc. stick to that and you will lose weight. It’s that simple. You can track your steps, exercise , and weight. Can’t think of a healthy yet delicious meal? It’s got that too. Try it out- If I can lose 30 lbs with no additional work out besides working - You can too.",

Over the years I’ve used MANY weight loss apps.  Some from BIG corporations with their own programs to ones that were just an app company.  This app is so well created, developed, user friendly, and robust that I have ever used.  You know when you use an app and you think’ “I wish it did...”? Well, every time I think that with this app...IT DOES IT!!! I actually found this app because of a recipe search I did which led me to buy it for the recipe.  Even the recipes are amazing!!! They are simple, perfect for Keto, and just “normal” foods that most of us I already.  This app really helped me to kick off my Keto journey!!! Thank you!!!",

It synced for a day but then stopped, so I had to keep turning it on and off in settings to be able to start syncing again. A couple days ago it stopped syncing at all and said I had to turn Fitbit on through the carb manager website via desktop. I thought this was finally a fix - I went ahead and synced from their website and now it doesn’t work at all.  I followed all the steps to sync my Fitbit to the carb manager app. my Fitbit website is perfectly synced with the Fitbit app but the CarbManager app or website doesn’t sync at all. Very frustrating... if they fix the syncing my rating goes back to 5 stars but it’s 3 for now as it’s not delivering as promised right now.

51,3,2018-12-03T00:02:15.000Z,ana3065,Great app,I found this app a few months back and it’s actually been super useful and I love it. I personally find it quite easy to use and it’s great that it saves and tracks all the food that I put in so I don’t have to keep scanning the same things over and over again that I eat on a daily basis. I will say I do struggle to load this app quite often. I know it’s not my phone because I don’t have this issue with any other app but for whatever reason maybe I can barely ever get it open unless I’m connected to Wi-Fi and even then it sometimes takes forever to load which means I sometimes have to hopefully remember to enter things later on in the day when it decides to open. I’d love to give it 5 stars but when I’m rushing and trying to put things in quite quickly before I leave the house or am out and about it can be annoying and inconvenient and completely defeats its purpose. It definitely needs a few updates and adjustments but I would still highly recommended.,
52,2,2019-01-02T23:27:52.000Z,TlPapera,Extremely inaccurate,"It’s easy to fall in love with this app at first. It’s easier to give them a five star rating with the automatic pop up “rate me” only minutes after downloading and believing it to be “the app that gets me away from MyFitnessPal and the old calorie counting”. And how cool is it that it makes meal plans for you? Yup that was me. However, this app is highly inaccurate. I was fooled by the 4.5 star rating, but it only makes sense. The way it’s set up makes it challenging to accurately rate it. And try to find the button to rate them after the fact. Good luck! I finally found it, obviously (marked “show us love” under settings). I went on google and found exactly what I thought. A lot of people complain of the accuracy. Not only are the recipes extremely inaccurate , so are the items scanned. I did a test and out of 15 items scanned, only two were completely accurate. I did not have this problem with fitness pal. Such a bummer. This app could really be the new best thing, but you can’t lose trust in your customers.",

So I go to the app store and see it has an update- hmm, that downloads fine but I “couldn’t connect” all afternoon?? I truly hate when developers force upgrades to continue access. BUT no required update was mentioned in-app?? Also I did not realize I had to have a connection to enter or EVEN REVIEW my foods- super inconvenient!!! That meant I had to resort to writing everything down on paper all afternoon! I don’t mind limited access to the food db, but we should be able to access favorites and our previous logs without an internet connection.",

But since this app has helped me so much, I must give credit where credit is due. ‘Getting Started’ allowed me to set up daily goals within a ketogenic program. The Keto diet often feels confusing and counter-intuitive but this app guides you through it, every day. It has been fascinating to learn all the time, about the true carb content of various foods. The Find Food section is just incredible. It has actually been FUN, dieting and using this app. I’ve been using the app for about 6 weeks now, and it is absolutely responsible for allowing me to lose 15 pounds. I did not think it was possible - I’m over 60 and injured so exercise these past months has not been possible. Seriously, if you allow this app to guide you and you are committed, you WILL lose weight. I just can’t recommend it enough.",
55,4,2019-04-21T16:47:08.000Z,Ro7068,I LOVE IT BUT.....,"This is a great app. I would never use it to calculate your macros as their calculations are always way off, but once you put in your custom macros it’s a fantastic app to track your food. Frankly I couldn’t do keto without this app!! Having said that I wish I could copy entire meals to multiple days at a time. Right now it’s very easy to copy an entire meal or an entire day to another day, but if you have the same meal (for example breakfast every day) it’s impossible to copy it to multiple days at a time. Secondly, I paid for premium and as soon as the first “month “ was over, it went back to regular. Trying to reach someone in customer service is impossible because it’s basically some sort of robot that responds. The response is the same regardless of what question you ask. While it was easy enough to get a refund from Apple before I re-purchased the premium, I hope it doesn’t keep happening.",

I was a long time My Fitness Pal user but then I started Keto and I was frustrated that it wouldn’t do Net Carbs, it just wasn’t in my opinion really the best app for Keto so I wanted another solution. Carb Manager is Taylor design for this diet and makes it so easy. I am so impressed with all the thought that has been put into this app. Every time I think I wish I could do something I find that the developers have incorporated it into the app. It is so user friendly to use, I love the interface. I absolutely love the meal planning features, such a time saver!!! Speaking of meal planning the recipe selection is off the chain. Bottom line if your doing Keto and you want a tool to make it easy for you to track and plan in my honest opinion you can do no better than Carb Manager!",

The app has helped me understand the various properties of the food I eat and through the factual information, has provided me with much more freedom than I’d been used to. Using the app, I’ve come to find out I had been maintaining a diet of roughly 3,200 calories. Now, I am set up with an 1,800 calorie per day diet and so far I feel great!

It is very customizable and easy to use. It breaks down all your macronutrients so you can understand how much you are really consuming and what your putting into your body. It also allows for you to input your own recipes and then it breaks it down into carbs, fats, protein, sugar and calorie amount so you can better portion it all out. This app made keto possible for me. Without it I would be completely lost. I am considering going premium even though the free version is more than adequate. That’s how much I love this app!

I had been using MFP for years but if you’re doing Keto this is a much better option so you can see your macros right in your home page. My only complaint is that the food database is not as complete as MFP, and I have encountered a few errors on some food entries. These are things that hopefully will improve with time. You just have to double check a few things to make sure your numbers don’t get thrown off. I would also like it if there was an easier way to add friends that you know have the app. And I’d like to be able to share recipes that I’ve entered so that friends who are eatting the meal I’ve made can easily add an entry without typing the whole recipe in themselves.

Now I have to drop down because for a few weeks I was able to start “Tomorrow”’s - or any day- food list. Now it wants me to pay for Premium to do what I’ve already been doing for a month. As a 7 pm- 7 am worker at a hospital this capability has been important in starting and keeping to a healthier lifestyle as sometimes I work 3 shifts in a row, have one day off, and work 3 more shifts. It allowed my sleep deprived self to just look at my meals and pack lunch/dinner accordingly. No longer an option. I feel that allowing me to do the lists and then taking that option away unless I pay for it - and I found no mention of “trialing” the planning- is a little underhanded. Up until this I loved this app and it’s ease of use, easy interpretations, and for the planning! As a night shifter (not everyone has day jobs!) I find yet again, that developers forget not everyone runs on a daytime schedule.","Hey there, thanks for the feedback. Adding foods for tomorrow and future days is now free again!

Before this app, I had no idea what percent of my diet was fat or protein. There is just one flaw that I question, and maybe I have not found a setting that exists to fix it, or maybe it’s a premium feature. My carb count always shows way over my limit and it’s because the app is not deducting fiber from my carbs. I eat one Mission Carb Balance wrap per day because it gives me 15g of fiber and only 3 net carbs (the spinach variety), but the app recognizes this as a full 18g carb, so I am always in the red, over my limit of staying under 20g (net carb) per day. If not for this the app would be perfect, well done! I appreciate using it. Despite this I highly recommend this app, you just need to deduct your fiber from your total carbs yourself and ignore the red.",

You literally can just jump right in and start logging after filling out a few things. My only issue is that yesterday, which was my first day using the app, it would not allow me to finish logging my dinner. I had one more item to add for the day. Every single time I tried to log my grilled vegetables, the app would prompt me to upgrade to premium. There was no way around it other than to not log the veggies. Today the app Is allowing me to log as I start a new day. No where in the information do I see a maximum amount of items that you are allowed to log before having to upgrade. While I do not mind paying for an app like this, I always like to try them for at least a month to make sure I really like it. Open to suggestions...",
64,1,2021-01-19T07:58:29.000Z,sasalala751,Lots of bugs and not user friendly,There’s a decent amount of good reviews for this app so I decided to pay for a year of premium despite there being no free trial days. That was a big mistake on my part. This app is not user friendly and takes quite a while to figure out how to properly navigate. The feature that allows you to create a meal plan constantly bugs out before I hit save. I started a meal plan on a day just to test it out and see how it works. Then I updated the meal plan and hit start again. It ended up adding to the previous meal plan instead of updating it. I tried looking for ways to cancel the previous plan or delete meals individually but couldn’t figure it out. The shopping list feature also has bugs. I had a snack listed for my meal plans but later deleted the snacks and hit save. It still gets listed on the shopping list so I went back to check my meal plan and it’s not even listed on there anymore. I don’t recommend paying for premium. I definitely won’t be using it anymore and am waiting to hear back about a refund.,"Hi sasalala751 - Thanks for letting us know about the issues. Those are definitely not typical for the app, and we'd love the opportunity to provide personal assistance and get this sorted out for you. If you haven't already, please reach out to our friendly support team in the app via Settings → Help & Support, and be sure to include your app store username for fastest service. Typical response time is about 24 hours right now. All the best in the meantime!"

As advertised. But finding the items to place into your meals is annoyingly difficult. Every time you attempt to add an entry, it requires internet. Then after finding the item you wish to add through their giant database, you have to search for it likes it’s the first time every time. You can’t search recently used for frequently used items. You can’t sort using recent. When you enter the search function before typing, it brings up recent items. But you have to scroll through them all to find the one item you used weeks ago. Why isn’t there better search functionality? And after adding it once, why can’t we add that item again without the internet? If MyFitnessPall has a Net Carbs function, I would have kept using it instead of this. Carb Manager has a lot of improvements to make to improve my ratings. Securely a mediocre app.","Hello from Carb Manager support and thank you for your review. We thank you kindly for the excellent feedback.

I tried the free version for about three days then paid for a year, it was totally worth it for the recipes, and to have it pull in data from my second Fitbit.    My lessons:   I do much better when I log water, don’t ignore that.   Short morning walk make a huge difference.  I drink an Ultima every day, use more salt, and added a cheap multivitamin, C, and D for days I don’t get good balance.  I know I would’ve gotten better results if I do exercise more but I’m just lazy. I have a cheat day once a month where I eat everything I want and a cheat meal once a week where I don’t get too crazy.

I tried using MyFitnessPal for a while, but find Carb Manager just works for me better so I'm back and happy about it. Two pet peeves though are that so many people forget to include the sugar alcohols so net carbs for so many foods are incorrect. That's very frustrating. Something that should have 0 net carbs shows having 8 and that can throw off my entire day. How long does it take for products to get adjusted on the app? On the old app users could select an adjusted entry with the corrected nutritional values but I see that option is now gone sadly. Also two things I love on MyFitnessPal which I'd love to see adopted here would be the ability to swipe and add a meal from the food diary the day before. As well, I'd love a ""copy from"" the day before, instead of ""copy to"". That'd be much more convenient.",
69,2,2021-03-12T13:41:00.000Z,FL love it,New version is dreadful,"This app used to be so easy to use, but now...not so much.  I wanted to give it some time before writing this review, to give myself a chance to get used to it, just in case I was only resistant to the changes solely because they were new, but not necessarily bad. Nope. They’re bad. I’m forced to re-enter my custom meals as recipes so that the various elements will show, rather than just the macro totals.  All of my favorite foods have randomly changed their quantities, so when I enter foods into my log I’m now forced to reestablish the quantities I always use (example: I always use grams as my measurement, but now the app seems to have everything set to 1/4 cup).  I’m in this app all day long, and am very dependent on it. I’m stuck trying to make this work because I’m a premium member and don’t want to waste my investment. But if you’re new to food tracking, you might want to look at MyFitnessPal. I chose CarbManager because it seemed less complicated to me, but that is definitely no longer the case.",

It works great IF you are NOT sharing someone else’s meal plan. She loaded a whole weeks worth of recipes based off of CarbManagers meal plans and it is frustrating, if not down right impossible, for me to find the same recipes that she is able to enter. I’ve even used the web search with their recipe title and still no results. Ham and extra sharp white cheddar omelette should be pretty easy to find, or so you’d think. So......I get to search and search and search and search until MAYBE the app will recognize what recipes it allows her to make for us. Ugh!!! Being able to “share” recipes with friends on the app with ALL nutritional value and fixing the search for their own recipes would make me give this 5 stars, but the time I waste searching for a meal they design is a waste, hence the 3 stars.","Hey there, thanks for the feedback!

But this app changed everything for me. It makes it so easy to log exactly what you ate in the exact portion and gives you the exact nutritional count with graphs so can visually see everything in multiple ways. I can’t say enough about Carb Manager. I look forward to laying in bed each night and logging everything because it does all the difficult calculating for me. But it doesn’t stop there. Add your exercises, water, ketones, blood sugar, weight, on and on. I knew within just a few days using it that this was going to help my carb and weight journey so I paid for the upgrade. Well worth it. I only write reviews when something is very bad or very good. This app is beyond very good.",

I was following the directions for the meal plan just as it was provided to me and I was losing very slowly bouncing up and down, a pound down then up, a little here, a little there.  My son, who had been on the Keto Diet for over a year told me about the Carb Manager program he had loaded on his his phone and how much it had helped him.  So, I downloaded Carb Manager and I could actually see what I was eating on the diet plan my husband had ordered for me.  I began to make adjustments, cutting out things here and there, like onions, I never knew they had so many carbs.  I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate this program and how much it has been helping me.  Thank you.",

The old version - ugly as it was -  made it super easy to see my total macros consumed, goals, exercise/activity (for smart macros function) and adjusted net values all in one place at the bottom of the daily log.  Now you’re making me swipe through multiple charts to find this info. And not only that, the math is wrong! For example, when I add a food entry to a meal, the app will list the net carbs for that serving and let me know that if I add the item I’ll have maybe 2 net carbs left to “spend” that day. But then when I go to the Home Screen, it gives me a different number, often much higher. And by “home screen” I’m talking about the daily log where I now have to scroll through multiple chart views to figure out what my gross and net totals are for calories and macros.  What the...?!

When you scan a barcode it acts like it’s not there. It acts like it scans but nothing appears. It was a common food do I tried again. That time it appeared. Next day. Same thing. You have to scan twice.  Second the old version when you looked up a food you had used before it would remember how much you used so it was easy to type in heavy whipping cream and 1 tsp would be there. Now it reverts to the top measurement. So entering food takes longer. Plus certain measurements on certain foods are gone. So heavy whipping cream no longer has teaspoon. Other foods are missing measurements I used a lot like grams. I’m disappointed. If My Fitness Pal would make it easier for us keto people I would go back to them.,

The reason I haven’t upgraded is because the one thing I like about the ETM app is that it will suggest foods at the end of the day based on my macro targets, calories and how many carbs I have left for the day. So if I have 4 carbs available and my carb intake has been at 3% it will make suggestions or recipes and foods that I can choose to hit my targets.

I started the Keto diet and needed a way to track my macros. It is now November 20th and I weigh below 200 pounds for the first time since 2013. Carb Manager is easy to use but you absolutely need to be honest and put everything in that you eat or you will fail. The circle helps you see your progress. It shows all of your recent foods so they are easy to add when you eat them again. I would not have done this without this app. It has made it so much easier. I am a Keto lifestyle person now and plan to keep using the app. If I don’t, I will start eating hidden carbs. That sets you up for failure. It takes just a few seconds to enter what you eat, or plan to eat and that is important. I love Carb Manager.",

It’s extremely well-designed and targeted for low-carb and keto diets, makes it easy for me to track what I’m eating, and never makes me feel bad FOR eating! I was really nervous when I searched for a diet app because I didn’t want to make dieting any worse for me, but this app is helping and not hurting. Especially with keeping track of the “invisible” carbs that fall through the cracks. The developer clearly put a lot of time and effort into this app. Little things like the built-in water counter - something it’s very important to make sure you have enough of in the early stages - really make it obvious.

I love that I can set my specific diet plan such as “Keto”, “low fat”, “build muscle”, and this app will help guide me into that path. I had NO IDEA I was eating so many carbs! My mind is blown but I’m excited to continue on my weight loss journey. Oh, and one more AMAZING aspect of the free option, you can simply scan the barcode of a package of food, instead of typing in the brand name and style and amount. It’s super handy.

I lost almost all my saved recipes. Nutrition data is inaccurate ~50% of the time now, particularly when you choose to weigh things out in ounces (which I do for everything). I have to stop what I’m doing to report each case of inaccurate data, which is impossible when I’m in the middle of cooking and trying to rebuild a recipe I used to have saved. Plus, the interface is oversized. One logged day used to fit almost all one one screen (without scrolling), but now theres so much extra data built in, I have to scroll three times as far. It was clearly not redesigned with a regular size iPhone screen in mind. It really is a shame, I will be cancelling my subscription and will be on the search for another app that is closer to the original version of this one.",

Somehow “they” (AP makers plus community doing this) have taken the whole bz of weight loss into something almost scientific.  Why? Because, with the keto strategy, you can get some keto sticks and check ur urine (or blood) and see if ur intake is what ur intending it to be. I think most people who remain in a ketotic state for at least a week or two will drop pounds with this and often quickly so. I’m working on just how to best use this as are many others on the AP or site. Good luck with all, but if you’re looking for is something “new” and practical, not to mention with community of some real smart people, this is surely something to try.

Whereas, Romaine (Cos) Lettuce is under the R's (where I would expect to look for it), things like, ""Deli Boar's Head Ovengold Turkey Breast by Fresh Direct"" are under the B's, and I have to look all over for it.

This App does it all for you the only thing you have to make sure is to journal and it makes you decide if it’s worth it to you to eat.  I’ve lost weight and still enjoy going out to eat.  I figure out by putting what I’m going to eat from whatever restaurant in my journal first.  All the calculations are done for you with this App so if it’s over your allowed intake you start changing things around.

Add food to breakfast two days ago, still in the add screen and try to add something to lunch the same day, but all of a sudden you are back on todays date. Have to exit out, change the date, and search again. Also, I understand why it is an internet supported app (have to have internet to work), but they really need to add an offline version where you can still add foods but not search their database.

I work nights which is especially challenging for weight loss and I tend to just mindlessly eat constantly.

Phase 1 is the Loading Phase and can be recorded in the “ease into the diet”. But it currently doesn’t work. Also, if there’s a way to have multiple goals to set up for each phase, that would be great.

101,4,2019-04-28T13:12:10.000Z,ESlike711,Good,"I liked it, but searching for exercises is not easy. The search is slow, and you have to scroll through a million results to find what  you want. You basically have to search letter for letter what you want, or it won’t give you any results. And your only option for cardio is searching. It doesn’t give you a list to choose from like it does strength training. And you can only put in minutes - not hours. It’s very disorganized and inconsistent.",
102,5,2019-07-26T00:36:56.000Z,HeathersOcean,Seriously worth every penny !!!!!,"A sweet friend of mine has been after me to try the Keto diet again and I have been using another Keto app that is super expensive and renews every six months.  So when I told her about it, she said try this one.  It’s a yearly fee and much less expensive than the other one I was using.  I can do so much with this app and I use it every single day to track all my foods, exercise etc on the Keto diet.  I can plan my meals days in advance which helps with staying healthy.  I’m still learning all of the bells and whistles but this app offers a ton of flexibility and options for tracking everything !!!!  This is worth every single penny and you’ll be glad you spent the money.  This has been a HUGE help in my healthy weight loss journey !!!!",
103,3,2021-05-05T14:48:22.000Z,Agsloan,Update after latest update,"Love that you brought back the graphs even renewed my premium subscription. However, now after this recent update after entering my food eaten the graph is blank nothing shows up.  It did come back hours later but it still will be blank every time I enter my food for longer than I would like.  The graphs are so helpful. Please look into this problem and you will receive 5 stars Thanks.",
104,5,2021-01-03T18:45:16.000Z,Lexbrat,Incredibly awesome diet app!!,"Although it takes a few days to master this app, it is the most comprehensive carb counting diet app I’ve seen!  If you don’t have complete nutritional information to help you count your daily carb intake, you can scan the product barcode and it will tell you what the nutritional information is.  It has an extensive database of homemade and name brand foods and you can enter recipes and the app will provide the nutritional information.  All your inputted information can be saved to the database and the app administrators will double check the nutritional information and fill in the other macronutrients for you.  I’ve lost 13 pounds on the low carb diet in one month and this app has made it possible for me to make good choices.",
105,4,2021-03-02T05:03:45.000Z,Foster mom of 3,Helpful but needs a few updates,Started using this app when I started keto a month ago. What I've found so far is that the app is very easy to use. Can easily add foods and create your own recipes. The issues I've found is that it freezes up a lot (I often have to shut off my Wi-Fi to get it to kick in) and the scanner occasionally just won't work. The most important change that needs to me made is in the groups. I posted a comment in a group but then later had to scroll through all the other comments to find mine again and see if anyone replied. No notices if someone responds to your comment and no easy way to locate your comment to read the responses of you get them. This makes it next to impossible to really utilize the groups for assistance. Please fix that!!,

It appears I am selecting the same item but then something completely different shows up in my log. I’ve tried every which way to reset my phone and the app thinking there must just be some sort of glitch but nothing seems to work. these are some of the core foods I’m eating right now so at this point I can’t track anything and I’ve wasted $40 on an app that does not work.,"Thanks so much for the constructive feedback!.

I like a lot about this app but the one thing that I don’t like is the shopping list feature.  The list is not organized at all and you can’t remove items if you don’t need to buy it.  You can only cross it out.  The items are listed alphabetically, which does not make any sense. Items should be group by category, like produce, frozen foods, dairy... not avocados at the top and zucchini at the bottom of the list. And if you add two recipes that call for three eggs for one and six eggs for another... the shopping list does not combine the amount of eggs you need.  It lists them separately.  Sometimes the same item is on the list more than twice and they are not listed next to each other.   I think the free version is nice but the upgraded price is not worth it.","Hello from Carb Manager support and thank you for your review.

And as nerdy as it is, I LOVE the visual representation of intake. As with most apps of this nature, I wish there was a setting to determine your day. Meaning, I work night shift, so my 24 hour day spans 2 actual days, because I'm waking up and starting my day at 3pm and ending it around 9am. Any goals for ""the day"" are technically not met due to a conventional time frame being applied to an unconventional schedule. It's a small and kind of insignificant inconvenience. But it's important to night shifters.",

115,5,2020-06-19T22:38:45.000Z,Lexi RM,Very helpful tool to a healthier you!,This app has been extremely helpful in my journey to a healthier life. I used it for quite a while without purchasing the membership and it allows you to log all your food and exercise. The membership is awesome if you are just starting out. You can enter food sensitivities or foods that you want to avoid if you don’t care for them. It will literally generate a week long meal planner and give you a grocery list!! Or you can browse the recipes and add them to your favorites to try now or later. It’s an awesome app overall and you can even get involved in the carb manager community for support or link up with friends or family members to help support one another. I highly recommend this app!,
116,5,2020-02-15T09:49:56.000Z,AniqueDeepdelve,The best tracking program!,I absolutely adore this program.  It is worth every penny for the subscription which is very minimal compared to other diet tracking programs out there.,

You don’t have to pay for the premium account to get great use of this app. I was creating my own spreadsheet to count macros in different foods before I found this database and I’m pleased to save my time. The pie chart display makes it extremely easy to see if I’m short on any of my macros. You can save your own recipes to block in vs listing out individual ingredients over and over and over. Some common keto recipes (Egg Roll In a Bowl) are public access. New recipes are accessible for an additional monthly cost, but feels like an unnecessary luxury. Great app! Would love it if they’d go the distance of listing ingredients in different brands to help with planning the best meals. Developers— I might be willing to upgrade for that feature!",

App keeps crashing/recovering but losing progress when trying to build a custom meal plan. No easy way to swap individual meals or snacks if I hate particular ingredient in a pre existing meal plan. Cannot easily or at all look up a meal plan I generated for a future week, can only generate grocery list. You can only filter on fast and easy and not just easy. Sometimes easy things to bake are the best. Filters need a mega overhaul as free apps and websites help you find recipes on difficulty/involvement much better. No consolidation of ingredient choices.",
119,4,2020-01-30T12:49:22.000Z,(Hutch),Great app but wishing for one feature,The app allows me to track my macros in such an east and spectacular way. I also love using it to plan my meals. And the ability to make a “shopping list” is fantastic (although sometimes the quantities get messed up when you set it to get for the full recipe when you’ve planned to eat the meal multiple times).,

Every app I’ve researched and/or discovered were disappointing most because of ads and in-app purchases.  Then on Sunday, April 29th, I knew I had to find something because my eating was spiraling out of control and with every pound gain was a step towards death.  I found Carb Manager!! Finally an app that meet my needs.  I enjoy that I can get everything I need from carb and calorie counting to scanning foods as well as a food search to include a database.  Yes one can upgrade to premium but if you’re looking for an app that does the basics all for you Carb Manager is your tool on the journey to a healthier lifestyle.  Thanks for reading.. 😀",

My father in law suggested keto and I knew it meant some hard core dedication but it had to be done. At first I looked for a book to push and motivate me but then I realized I don’t want to carry a book around with me everyday so I started looking for an app for the phone since my phone is always with me. Carb Manager has saved my life. Down almost 40 lbs in 6 weeks cause I always got the app, the database, and the scanner which really helps. I couldn’t do what I am doing or stay track with my goals without this app. Don’t waste your money on a book or diet food. Eat real food and get healthy! I Highly recommend to get Carb Manager!

It has been instrumental in my loss of several inches off my waist only seven weeks ago. I have maintained constant ketosis since, rarely having my carbs exceed 21 g per day (and never over 30) since I started. Doing this without an easy tracking method would’ve been impossible. I had nearly given up on weight loss, and I’ve never had any diet or weight loss program achieve such dramatic results do quickly. I now am confidently looking down the road to reaching my lifelong goal of fitness and “average” weight at the age of 53. This app is the best app I’ve ever downloaded, hands down!",
123,4,2020-01-27T02:55:04.000Z,1craBmom,YES 🥰❤️🎉,"I was really worried when I started keto. Eggs, bacon, cheese, and LOTS of butter. Dr. Nick suggested getting this app in one of his beginning keto videos. I was skeptical, but downloaded it. I answered the question and picked what my goals were. That gave me my caloric parameters. When I started writing down what I was eating I was shocked to see how wrong I was doing it. I no longer gorge myself on eggs, bacon, and cheese. I’m eating a more rounded diet. I plan my meals the day before I eat them, that way I know that I will stick to keto. You can also add and take away foods if you change your mind. You can also write down what your eating when your eating it. You log when it’s good for you. You can also log your weight, track your exercise, and even get recipes. This has been a great app for me and my journey with keto.",
124,5,2020-07-15T00:05:01.000Z,<3PaNdA<3,Great App but...,This app is great and i love using it and would pay for the premium if i could afford it. One huge problem though is that you have to check the nutrients on every single thing you  scan in because people seem to think putting in the wrong amounts makes things healthier 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ why lie to yourself. I even had one that took off 30 carbs! Im astounded people would lie to themselves. So either put in your own foods or double check the servings and nutrients so you dont think its healthier than it is. Other than that yes id recommend this app and premium. It works lovely with fitbit too. Syncs everything immediately so you have updated amounts based on your daily routine and any added exercise.,
125,5,2020-05-16T02:58:58.000Z,ketojewel,This app makes keto lifestyle simple,I am at a lost of words. At first I was trying to be cheap and use the free version. Then I purchased the advance subscription for a year and in the first two days I broke my plato because I was able to count my macros. I thought I would never understand the macro thing until now. Don’t disregard the macro counting ESPECIALLY if you’re using keto for weight lost. last but not least you can put in your own recipes. This is very useful if you are making meals for a large family because the app will help you keep track of your macros by entering your personal proportions size after you’ve login the full recipe. Long story short save yourself time energy and hassle and get this app!!!,
126,5,2020-01-16T15:23:47.000Z,jadecarmella,Great free app!,"I’m on week 2 of Keto and have been using the free version of Carb Manager. What a fantastic app! It helps me log my food and see how much fat, protein and carbs I have left for each day! It has have every type of food I’ve searched for so far, even Keto Connect recipes and nutritional info for a local low carb bakery in ATL. It gives me reminders to log in my meals a few times a day and I really feel this is helping keep my Keto on track and helping me learn nutritional values of foods that I eat. It also gives the foods a Keto rating grade, to let you know if it’s Keto friendly or not. And this is all free! I may upgrade to the paid version eventually when I get more involved in recipes, but I’m just keeping it pretty simple for now.",

Then after I stopped, I tried switching to MyFitnessPal, and I found that it was almost unusable - covered in ads, and missing some basic functionality I've come to expect from a nutrition app. The pre-specified gradations of foods are super super useful, for example instead of saying ""3 oz of cheese"" I can just select ""1 cracker size slice"". This is ESSENTIAL for estimating nutritional content of meals you eat out! I'm shocked that more apps aren't doing this.",

I saw that one other person Siouxzee44 also had a q and hopefully they see this.... when you’re entering a recipe and you can’t save it - go to the top of your phone and de-select the position lock (prevents it from switching between landscape and portrait).

Easy to use but there’s just some areas that are incorrect or forcing to pay. A couple days totaled incorrectly even if quantities were adjusted. The fact that I can’t select a certain meal and add it to my log because it’s a “premium recipe” is ridiculous. How do you manage all the duplicates that were copied as “member recipes” because we couldn’t select it? Make it locked as a premium if users want the actual recipe but not if I already ate it and just trying to log it. In general, food and it’s recipes shouldn’t even be locked considering they’re available if searched through any browser and added for others to use. There’s so many other things that could be locked such as meal plans, but recipes?",

The first year I did very well, in fact with each weigh-in I was either at a loss or a plateau, never a gain. Then I started having moments of “cheating” where I would spend a day or three eating whatever I wanted. I always gained and always felt sickly. I could not get back to the great place I was in at the beginning. This was partly because I felt I knew what to eat and as such didn’t keep tabs on my consumption of fats/carbs. Once I found this app I feel like I’m back on track to keeping a tighter control on my consumption. The app is easy to use and has great lists for plugging in your foods.

This app will calculate your macros, customize your meal plans, provide recipes, give you access to helpful articles, etc. It is REALLY detailed; You can do a lot with it. You can track and log your goals, weight, body measurements, exercise, food, water, supplements, ketone readings, and even create/ log your own recipes and meals (although the library they have is seemingly endless).

The app told him he needed to consume 3007 calories a day. I knew this was wrong because that’s more than recommend amount for a normal diet, and you’re trying to lose weight you’re going to have to take some type of calorie deficit. I’ve also done Keto before so I knew just by the calories it was telling him to consume too much. Long story short looked online for some help and came across a program that lets you calculate what your daily macros would be while on keto, and it said he should be taking in 1779 calories a day. HUGE difference from 3007.","Thanks for contacting us! Could you message us via the Settings > Support Center? We can take a look at your account and see where the high calorie calculation came from.

I paid for the premium upgrade and it is so easy it also suggests recipes that are quick and easy and super tasty things that I will probably include in my recipe plan for the rest of my life great substitutes that are very low or no carbAnd you can easily just keep track of what you eat and if you fall off the wagon eat a burger or fries it shows you how you can adjust your eating for the rest of the day so you don’t really destroy all your progress can’t speak highly enough about this it’s great,

I often times find that it happens at very inconvenient times like when I am trying to plan my meals for the day or pack my lunch. Sometimes I can close the app and reopen it a few times and it will work, other times it will not work for hours later. I love the app and it’s features but the glitches need to go in order to make it more reliable.

That’s the main purpose of the app! To count carbs for Keto/low carb life stylers! I literally just scanned another one today that was wayyy off… usually fiber or sugar alcohols aren’t subtracted. Very inconsistent. For some I’ll just find a product that’s similar and put that as the food I ate rather than wasting so much time trying to update products, etc. which I have done before. The app is cumbersome to use, slow to find exercises, I don’t know I just don’t care for it failing at what may be its main purpose… to count carbs!!

I am still learning, but there is so much I don't understand, like I have know idea what a diabetic carb is!  Is it good or bad?  So I do wish for more info.  Also my Dr said to eat up to 45 carbs A MEAL, but this app encourages 44 carbs for the entire day!  So I'm assuming diabetic carbs are different.

We got a recommendation to try CM and so far I do like the easiness of seeing it all right there. Like the compatibility with other apps and devices. The best part for me is logging in my own recipes. MFP was ok in this, but I could never see how I made it, it was only the ingredients counter. Here you have it all! Love that feature. Also appreciate the recipes to inspire me to stay on track. Now to the bad - I find the database lacking a lot of foods that are easily found in MFP. If there is one thing that has to be improved this would be my suggestion. Also, when entering the amounts I liked how it can be decimal by typing not scrolling down a wheel of numbers.

Takes a little getting used to not quite as user friendly as MyFitnessPal but has a lot of good options for carb watchers and keto dieting that the others don’t have.  So far my biggest grip is the option of putting number of servings. If I eat 5 servings of something out of the norm one time and let’s say the serving size is 27 grams or 27 ml.  I can’t just select 5 servings and the app adds it up.  I need to take the time and figure 27x5 and adjust it. One time no big deal but having to do this multiple time becomes a nuisance. You can always get around this by making it a custom food and adding all the ingredients etc etc. but I don’t want to do that if it’s only a one time thing.   Please add the option to select number of servings.,

The ease of use along with the ability to log weight, inches, macros, calories, and anything anyone would want or need to track make this a great app. The only complaint I have is the need to update some of the macros in some of the foods and an issue with the scanning of foods. Sometimes when I scan some items, it will not add the calories and the macros into my tracker so I needed to google the foods to make sure I was adding the correct information to my tracker. Other than that, absolutely no complaints. I have a lot more to lose and know this App will help me get to where I want to be.","Thanks so much for that great review, Busybelle! 10 lbs in two weeks is amazing, and shows the power of low carb/Keto eating. We'd love to hear more about the issues that you've run into with the scanner; our support team can likely get those sorted out for you. You can contact them in the app via Settings - Contact Support. Cheers!"
145,2,2019-09-28T22:49:00.000Z,Miya6,Thought it was great at first.,Ok ... I totally loved this app when I started using it 4 days ago. I even gave up “myfitnesspal “ for this one. I even paid for the premium today so I could see my sodium. I thought to myself “this app is so great ; I want to give them $40 a year anyways just to support you guys.”  Now I’m starting to see a lot of errors when logging food. Like 3 net carbs for shrimp. Um... no. It even says in the nutrients info within the app when you scroll down that it is less than 1 gram. And if I edit the portion to correct the net carbs ; then all my other macros are off.  This is only one example. I’m finding numerous tnite. A lot of scanning Items and net carbs aren’t correct.,"Hello from Carb Manager support and thank you for your review. We'd be delighted to take a look at the logging issues that you've encountered and offer some assistance. Additionally, we'd love the opportunity to review your macro settings to ensure you're set up for success.

I’m pretty sure it was misrepresenting my macros as better nutritionally than they were. This app, ahem, doesn’t sugarcoat my situation, and it lets me know immediately whether I am meeting the right goals, rather than just leaving me to interpret a 3-color pie chart. I also like that this one has a sort of color warning system for specific foods. Digging it so far.",
147,5,2019-09-22T12:30:52.000Z,Abbie1dog,Easy to use! More than a diet app!,"I started out using this app to track my carbs. At my age (looking at 70, soon) I wanted to be more pro active in preventing many conditions that come with age and genetics. This app is perfect for me. I especially like how the scan feature helps me at the grocery store! I decided to purchase the upgraded version. Shortly after that, I was diagnosed with kidney disease. The upgraded version allows me to track the micronutrients that are now restricted in my menus! My numbers began to fall into almost normal range. My nephrologist was amazed at how well I was managing my dietary restrictions. When I told him about Carb Manager, he said he would look into it for several other patients. THANK YOU, CM.",
148,5,2019-11-04T04:34:23.000Z,Ty Simmons,Great app,"This app has been great! It really allows me to keep track of everything I am taking in. I log everything down to the salt and pepper I add. It just makes me feel better knowing what I have made and what works. I look at it as a way to eventually have a meal plan that I love. So far, I have enjoyed everything I have eaten on this KETO Health Plan. My husband was having some medical issues and I decided to make it a healthy change for us both to keep him from being tempted by cravings. I’ve been on it for 2 weeks and have gone from 158 lbs to 151 lbs. I sure didn’t expect it to work so quickly, but it definitely motivates me to keep going. This app helps to keep me on track.",
149,1,2021-02-12T14:39:39.000Z,Wha? Why?,Wha? Why?,"Yeeeah, if you could back in time and not do that one thing....  CM, for you it would be the update.  The layout is flashy but confusing. The food logs are off and don’t calculate the net carbs correctly. The iWatch no longer logs burned calories and macro adjustments. (Reached out to support and received crickets in reply) I’m disappointed to say the least. My SO is also completely underwhelmed with the app update. The original format worked wonders for our health.  Now I am basically using the app as a food log. Sadness overwhelms me. At least it was only a 3 month subscription purchase when it was on sale. (Thusly canceling) There should be a stress level section so I can input it going up every time I log onto the app.  PS I love all the Devs putting up 5 star reviews trying to save the sinking ship.  If you’re using supportive formal robotic language in your description of the features of the app... You’re faking it.",
150,5,2018-07-08T17:24:30.000Z,Heatherd333,Makes all the difference!!,"I have attempted the Keto diet (admittedly not the strictest adherence) several times with decent results. I had never really calculated macros or really counted anything but carbs. This time, I am using Carb Manager and it has made all the difference!! I see exactly how many carbs, calories, fat, protein, etc I need to take in for the day and keeping to this formula I have lost weight much faster. It’s really helped me see why I wasn’t as successful with my previous attempts. Every food I’ve searched for so far has been preloaded into the app so it’s easy to know the nutritional information for everything I’m eating. Have recommended this app to many family members and friends!!",

152,5,2018-09-23T13:43:08.000Z,Hshafer,Great visual representation of nutrition,"I started using this app a few weeks ago. I love the visual representation of my day. I’m not sticking to the plan how I should, but the blame for that is on me, not the program. I know if I do it right and actually get the exercise I need, I will see great results. Like everything else, I need discipline to follow through. The pie chart representation is nice for the macros of what you have eaten for the day. Then for your progress to your daily calorie allowance you follow a bar that shows your total calorie allowance and how many you’ve had so far. When I open the app throughout the day it opens to the correct page where i can see at a glance how my day is going. Great app!",
153,5,2019-01-30T01:57:54.000Z,Bluebelle99,Best Keto / LCHF App in World,"This app is so strong and so easy to use! I actually bought it by mistake in August 2018 without reading any reviews or checking it out and was totally annoyed at myself. So, then I started using it and now I’m a huge fan.  I have little patience and I don’t like having to take time to figure out an interface for data. The  foods and water tracking entry process is super fast and visually intuitive, the database is impressively vast and it is really simple to add a recipe or import one from its url. Also, there are a whole bunch of premium recipes - the ones I’ve tried have been favorites. I’ve been Keto / LCHF for 5 years and this app is the best I’ve seen for tracking. Thanks!",
154,5,2019-02-02T13:08:32.000Z,Juls13ltg,User friendly and detailed,So far I love everything about this FREE app. For me counting carbs has proven more effective than counting calories. I’ve used a couple of calorie counting apps in the past and a recipe app to calculate nutrition. I used  another carb counting app before I found this one. The other app didn’t have many features and not many food options to search from.,
155,5,2021-01-14T23:16:52.000Z,NadiaH.,Unable to sync Fitbit...ugh! - re-review,"Initially I gave this app 2 stars for my issue below. The support center reached out to me today (2 days after my request). This was the response: “ Hi there, There have been updates to the new version of the app for syncing fitness devices!”. So it seems to me like I purchased the app during this upgrade period and it took a while to finally update for me. Either way, I’m very happy with Carb Manager! I look forward to losing weight with this app.","Hi Nadia, that doesn't sound like normal app behavior at all - please reach out to our friendly Support team in-app via Settings → Help & Support and they'll help get your Premium features back and connect that Fitbit."
156,1,2021-03-26T19:36:41.000Z,Longtime Carb App User,New Update Is Awful,Carb Manager just completely updated their app (without giving notice to users...which is really harsh). The new “updated” app is cumbersome and takes a long time to open. It is very difficult to navigate and and saved foods/recipes are not organized in any helpful way. Also the visuals of daily progress of goals is now circles...which makes no sense.  How do you indicate on a circle if you go over your carb/fat/calorie goal...well you can’t is the answer..(this really makes no sense and was clearly designed by people who don’t actually use or understand the app). There is also no visual way to measure your actual daily progress against your goals....again the circles are worthless. The “old” interface was easy and intuitive. I wish the new update made sense but it’s like replacing an Audi with a golf cart and saying it drives better. The new updated app a big No thanks,"Hi there! We are so grateful for your long time support. First, rest assured that our developers are working quickly to tune the new version of the app. We also understand that many users have grown very familiar with the former app version and that the update is a big adjustment. Please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team (Settings → Help & Support) if we can help with anything specific!"
157,3,2021-03-23T22:33:17.000Z,ReallyReason,"Good, Could Be Great","This app works pretty well if you use it as a stand-alone app. It has a lot of features for tracking intermittent fasting, etc. I subscribe to the premium features for access to the recipes, so I also think it’s worth the money. That said, it has two bad issues, each worth a star off:","Hi there - thanks for the review and the feedback. We do suggest - and many users do this - that you use the ""custom meal"" feature for groupings of foods that you regularly eat together, but aren't necessarily a single recipe. Eg eggs + avocado + Keto coffee for breakfast, saved as a ""custom meal"" which you'll find under the three vertical dots beside any meal section on the Daily Log. Hope that's helpful."

It makes it so easy to track my meals, with great features like Favorites, super flexible portion sizes (weights, volumes, number, etc). The defaults for most foods are fairly typical, like 2 eggs or 1 cup of veggies. The UPC scanner is killer--just press the button, aim in the direction of the UPC and bam! it has read every item I've put to it so far!",
160,5,2018-04-02T12:04:00.000Z,Alsoomse,This app is amazing,"I had downloaded this app awhile ago but used another food tracking app until recently.  I decided to give this one a try, and am very happy that I did.  I like the way that the app tracks carbs and, especially, that it allows you to track vitamin supplements.  There are many other health-related factors that can be tracked besides weight, and this feature is very useful to me.  When using the other app, I was wishing that it included certain features.  My regret about this one is that I didn’t give it a closer look earlier - all the features that I want in a nutrition and physical well-being app are included in Carb Manager.  Outstanding!",
161,5,2018-09-24T13:39:54.000Z,alirose22,Great keto/carb tracking app!,"I love this app. It really takes the guesswork out of carb tracking, especially with net carbs. It is very user friendly. The free version is fantastic but the paid version is more than worth the small yearly fee (or monthly if you’re not big into commitment). I always hesitate to try out new tracking apps because I find most food data bases lag far behind MFP. I have not come across one food in the last two weeks that wasn’t in their data base! So far, I would say the data base is totally on par with MFP, the customization is easier and more thorough than MFP, and the premium subscription is cheaper than MFP.  Carb Manager is now my tracking app of choice!",

I didn’t have the time to calculate all the macros of recipes and find ones that work together to hit my goals every day. This app does it all!! I can choose which recipes I want and it’ll arrange it through the week along with snacks to make it all work. Then it makes a shopping list for me to make it even easier!!! My only complaint is the categories of the shopping list. Garlic has its own category. Kind of weird when it’s with the produce. Also, pork chops were listed under bone, not meat. It’s all in the same place at the store so I don’t know why it’s separated on the list. But all together this app is awesome!!",

I tried Weight Watchers but I like to know all the nutrients that I am consuming. This app has some many features that I am about to purchase premium, but even using it for free us everything I need right now, tracking nutrients, linked to apple health to track my steps, and the best feature of all is the scanner where you just scan the barcode on the food you eat and everything pops up.

I think the fact that I can create a recipe, save it and then instantly see that recipe available with all the macros already figured up is amazing! If you’re on the fence about the premium service remember this. If you have a Fitbit, Garmin, iPhone or iwatch you can sync it to the Carb Manager app. Any exercise you then do will automatically chance you daily requirements based on calories burned. To me that alone is worth it. Not to mention the extensive list of recipes and advanced features. This is an app that won’t disappoint.",

Everything that I eat goes into carb manager and wow is it enlightening. The app keeps me absolutely on track and I know for sure I could not just estimate my macros accurately. The upgrade (paid) version is a must as it makes all the brand names available as well as great recipes. I honestly believe the app has kept me going on keto. For informations sake- I am doing keto for body composition and metabolic purposes, weight lift frequently, etc. but for anyone trying to loose weight you MUST count your macros and carb manager makes it so easy!!

Plus this app hasn’t been updated for 5 months.. this is not a good sign.. Some work needs to be done about recording weight of foods. If I want to record 300 g of something i need to convert it to oz first because wheel with number goes only up to 100. Plus using fractions instead of decimals is another flaw. I hope this stupid number wheel will be converted to digital pad..,"Hey there, and thanks for sharing your feedback.

I’m disappointed I no longer have use of the same features I did when I downloaded it. I wouldn’t mind paying to upgrade the app if it weren’t a subscription service. Honestly, what a joke. For that price, I can go back to My Fitness Pal. Just have users pay $20-30 one time to unlock all daily tracking services and done. I don’t care about fancy menus and all the other nonsense that I’d be paying $40-$100/year for depending on my subscription. The daily tracking is so handy but I feel like they’re going overboard trying to wring users out of their money. I won’t be upgrading, and I’ll be looking elsewhere for macro tracking.",

This is seriously an amazing app!! Note- I did spend the money on the premier subscription almost immediately so I’m not sure which features are included and which are not but if you’re considering it, it’s definitely worth the money!",

You can also track your exercise with a nice built in list of exercises to choose from (though I’d enjoy more exercises added for the workouts I do). Hydration and sleep schedule are also trackable too, as well as weight. I haven’t tried the paid version yet, and the meal planning and data analysis options are very tempting, but I’m turned off by the fact that it’s a monthly fee and not a one-time purchase.

I’ve read a lot and watched many videos and clearly doing Keto the best way includes ensuring you count your macros.  Now that I’ve been diligent with using this app, I better understand-I would say starting Keto is a totally life changing process and using the app is great but could be a bit too much at the very beginning if someone wasn’t at all familiar.  My suggestion would be 30-60 days into the Keto journey for someone new to Keto.  Great app thank you.",

I found a lot of different apps labeled keto and low carb and by far this one is hands down the best. I’m still on the free version and it honestly meets all my needs and I haven’t found any negatives so far. Once in a blue moon there may be a good I don’t find but I can enter that on. I’m definitely planning to upgrade to premium for the added benes. For anyone new to keto I would definitely recommend this app to really help you stay on track.","Now that's a glowing review. Thanks so much, Suzy! We really appreciate you. There are plenty of other fitness apps out there, but we're pretty sure that we're the most robust Keto/Low carb specific app on the market.

I upgraded to the premium version to access meal plans and recipes. First problem I had is if you tap to generate a plan you have to wait because there is delay. Didn’t realize this because I tapped again and it brought me all the way to the beginning and I lost the customized plan that took me 40minutes to build after going through looking at all the recipes and such. Then I lost time again after finally getting a plan to finding where it is. It doesn’t really give you the portions or tell you how much you should be consuming based on the macros in the plan. Overall disappointed I paid for 3 months and I won’t be using this crap! No trial period so you are just hosed! Good idea but bad mobile rollout in my opinion.

The barcode scanner refuses to scan some barcodes, and will sometimes even crash the app, which never used to happen. The old version used to save all of my frequently eaten or recently viewed foods so nicely, and now insists to push “my foods”, recipes I created for a one-time log over a year and a half ago back in my face. Or it will glitch and populate the same 8 recently viewed foods in an infinite loop. Forget about logging in a recipe if you need to switch tabs, it will crash out.

The app allows you to log your food various ways and does a great job in breaking your meals and food down to see where your diet can improve. It does take a short time to log, but it can be eye opening to see how much is really in the food we eat. If you truly value the opportunity you have to change your life through your diet.

I gave it a 4 star because when you are creating your own recipe and make a mistake, you cannot move the cursor to where the error is. Instead, you have to place it at the end of that sentence or line and hit the backspace until you get to the error. It’s a bit annoying.

However, when I attempt too enter the next food, it switches back to today. When I go back to meal planner, I must first click on another day, THEN back on my original Monday planner to get it to work. So frustrating I'm about to give it up and cancel my membership. Another glitch I'm having is that no matter hope many times I try to adjust my daily macros (I carb cycle), they don't ""stick"". Perhaps the developer has a solution?",

I’m almost 60 and I find it one of the most user friendly health apps out there.  It’s not only for keto dieters but for anyone who wants to keep track of their carbohydrate intake. I love the pie chart, the tracking chart showing my weight loss and the comment section. I like to type in a little note on how the day went and the weight chart give me inspiration when I see my weight trending down. If your new to theses type of apps I would recommend Carb Manager. I’ve shared it with my daughter and son in law and they now are both using it.",
185,2,2021-02-18T03:19:40.000Z,Silly Suz,Not liking the Feb 2021 Update,"I LOVED this app. It was user friendly and visually easy to locate items to log. I loved how easy it was to create recipes and have the macros calculated, I could easily read the graphs to track my glucose and etc.   But I’m NOT A FAN of the recent update! I lost data, it’s taking me longer to find my custom food items and there seems to be more steps to log meals etc.   Visually it’s harder to see things at a glance. I’m not sure how long I will stay with this app after this update. I will be searching for another app that is more user friendly, more visually appealing and meeting my tracking needs. ... which is a bummer because I LOVED this app!",
186,5,2019-12-14T18:18:50.000Z,LoveT21,Love it so far!,"I have only had this app for a week and after a few days I did buy the paid version (I really needed all the extra help!). Totally worth it so far!! I have lost 4 lbs this week because I am staying on target!! I love all the ways I can track what I am doing, and I have not even really dug into the recipes yet due to time constraints, but definitely will! This app really is perfect if you are doing keto. Five stars from me! Thanks for this great app! My only wish is that I could at least access My Foods data I have added and add meals/info even if off line. Then it could update/sync when back online. That would be a phenomenal update!!",

I have tried so many times to go low carb in the past 25 years and have not been that successful. But with Carb Manager and the right state of mind to lose weight, I have gone down to my weight when I got married 30 years ago!! Carb Manager is so easy to use and in valuable when going Keto. I will continue to use it when I go on a low carb maintenance plan. Carb Manager is flexible and customizable to how you want to lose weight and how fast. Being able to input recipes and scanning grocery product was awesome. Great app and couldn’t have lost the weight without it!",
188,5,2020-03-07T20:54:59.000Z,dumptheads,Information Central!,This is the best app I have come across for tracking nutrition.  Even if you are not doing Keto you still get a fabulous nutrition breakdown.  I love that I can see the day to day impact from more than the macronutrients we track for Keto.,

I was using another weight loss app but didn’t feel I was getting the most accurate information. Then I found Carb Manager! Not only has it helped me manage my carb intake, but also helps me see my fat goals and protein goals. I found some errors in my meal planning and was able to make the necessary changes thanks to this app! I love that I can scan the foods I eat which makes logging very easy. As well as being able to create my own recipes and save to my favorites. Considering going premium so I can see what else this awesome app has to offer!",
191,5,2018-06-30T08:30:48.000Z,gemsbysky,The best for Keto,After checking out most of the other apps available for iPhone decided to download this. So very happy. Reviews are originally what sold me on it but then I started using it and was completely sold. I didn’t go premium until using it for a couple days and still went back to check the other apps to make sure that it would be worth the money. Absolutely worth it!  Very very happy. This app is truly  the best. Believe me you will try it too and see. There are some pretty awful ones available. Highly recommend  CM.  I know this app will keep me on my keto original goal and beyond and it’s so easy to use. Loving!,

I attempted to use a few other apps, and this one is by far the most user friendly. It has a lot of realistic recipes that I actually want to eat and doesn’t take half a day to prepare. I’ve tried about 7 recipes so far and each one has been good or great!","Hi there, thanks for the awesome feedback! We're delighted that your loving the app!

I then discovered the Carb Manager app. Thank you for the this App. Without it it would be very difficult. I’ve been to amusement parks and I’m able to use it to locate keto friendly food. Or use it on all my travels. I travel a lot for work. I do not know how it compares to other apps, as I have no need to go look. This app fits everything I need to look up and use. I am using the freeware version. So far I have not needed to switch to premium. But I may try it out to see what’s so different. Great job keep it up!",
194,5,2020-03-27T02:43:15.000Z,Surfer Skip,Incredible App!,"Bravo to the programmer(s) who put this app together. It’s the best app I have ever used, just wish I would have found it sooner. I have been on a keto low carb diet for a year and lost 42 pounds. Found this app and now I am doubling my monthly rate of weight loss from an average of 3.5 pounds a month to 7 pounds a month. This app is so easy and educational to use. You don’t have to be on a keto low carb diet to benefit from using it as it tracks calories too. I find it enjoyable to use and can’t wait each morning to put in my new weight and what I had for breakfast and other meals and see my glide path to my goals. Congratulations to the programmers!",
195,3,2021-02-19T22:21:04.000Z,Daughter5,Not an easy tool anymore,"I loved this app before the latest update.  Now it takes me so long to find the features I use most.  I loved being able to weigh my food and enter the amount with a keyboard that let me use decimals. That’s gone.  And I loved that the foods I eat the most were right there.  Now I have to touch at least three tabs to get to that feature.  When I’m adding my foods, the “wheels” are so close to each other I tend to change the measurement wheel without noticing.",

Returning to Keto was a little tough, but finding this app to track food, water and activity is a WINNER! My first two weeks, I was a little reluctant but this is SO easy! It gives me a great view of my daily habits and choices and how they can affect my success. So many foods are preloaded and not just individual foods, but something like instant rice with chicken bouillon (not a good choice!), different size tomatoes and even measurements just as you would use in recipes. The detail is wonderful! Thanks for making a great app that I look forward to using to help me work my way to the best year and best health ever!",

I’ve also tried many different ways to keep track of what and how much I’ve consumed. By far this app provides a ton more information and allows me to add recipes as I find new recipes or create recipes myself. Not only can I keep track so much easier than ever before but this app provides recipes, allows me to add recipes from the web, and gives me credit for my workouts. This app really is everything I could hope for in tracking my carbs, needing information to be successful in my journey to stay healthy.",

It appeared to have pretty much everything I wanted in an app for keto tracking. I was extremely disappointed when I went to print off a recipe so my husband would be able to prepare it because I’d be working late. Unfortunately the print option did nothing except to tell me I’d need to go to the website version to print. When I did that and signed in my account did not come up it acted as if I was a new person needing to start all over again. Hence no way to print the recipe. I was even more disappointed when I found no way to contact anyone to rectify this situation. My only recourse has been to leave this review. I wont be renewing my subscription, very disappointing and feel duped unfortunately.","Hello from Carb Manager support and thank you for your review.

The % of macros is updated with each food item.  I can print it and bring to my dr. I am not tech friendly and I managed to teach myself and navigate in a couple hours.

I know essentially apps do the same thing if they have a large enough data base... but this app is geared towards low carb and I can see my info really quickly and know if I’m track. Open it, and I automatically see my net carbs. That is essentially what made me switch from my fitness pal (I have to scroll... open my macros... do the math myself... much longer.

My meal plan was “Keto” like for 2 of the many weeks of my training. Every week I had to take progress pics and the weeks end my Keto plan was where I saw the better results. So after my competition I added carbs back for 2 weeks and then went straight Keto. I lost more weight than the app anticipated. At a high activity level, I was expected to lose 2 lbs a week. I weighed in at 150.5 on a Saturday and by Friday I was down to 144.5. I wanted to maintain 145 so hopefully the maintenance phase I’m on will keep me at this weight.

Having said that, I was able to track all the carbohydrates that I put into my body as well as sodium, fats and proteins. The only issue I have with this app is the price. I personally think it’s too high for an app. But in carb managers defense all the other apps for keto or diet... price around the same range. I am only using the free version at this time, I think I am going to pull the trigger and buy a subscription to the app because I do think it’s a great tool that I need in my arsenal.

For example, it came up with 800 grams of fat for 28 grams of pecans????? I’ve tried different ways of selecting other serving sizes to work around this and it produces the same result.  I can’t live like this.  I count on this app for a daily record of my meal plan and I expect it to be accurate.  I’m about to message Customer Service.  This bug needs to be fixed immediately.

I haven’t had a problem until the last update.  I just figured out what happened. When it updated it changed the calorie counter to subtract my burned calories.  That is not what I want and when you update you shouldn’t just make changes to someone’s program.  Also it was quite difficult to find the area to fix the issue.  I have been racking my brain trying to figure out what I was doing different.  Turns out I was going over my limits because the app was subtracting what I was burning.  Don’t do that to people.  When you do an update, simply do a tutorial to show what is new, different, or better and allow the user to decide.","Hi there, and thanks for your review!

213,5,2020-03-24T20:57:39.000Z,MayleeBrooke,Love this app,I really love this app. It is very easy to find the foods I need to input and when I can’t I love just scanning the barcode. It is very easy to use. It was easy to input my exercises too and it subtracts from daily calorie intake which is optional you can choose for it to not. The only thing I don’t like is the fact it charges you for premium and in that is their recipes but if you google a certain recipe they have on the list you can view it for free on google. So it should really just be added in the free version. But other than that I have no complaints and I really love it. It’s the best app I e ever found.,

Don’t waste your money it will just frustrate you and you will never get your money back. I saw my meal plans one day and then they vanished and the meal plan still had foods in it I can’t eat. I don’t normally write reviews but I have to stop others from wasting their money. I’ve tried since the first week to cancel and get my money back but there was no option. Horrible. Update I just now received a response from their customer support which as you can see is long after this review. And of no help now that my subscription expired. I got no use from the app and paid for nothing. Very poor customer service,"Thanks for contacting us! Please note that after you apply a meal plan, you need to individually log items (tap the three dots next to the food in your Daily Log, then select Log Item).

This would be a 5 star App if they made entering a little bit easier. Maybe if it could remember what you ate the previous day so you could just copy and paste it to the next day. (I’m still new to it so it might have this feature) Also, if you could text a meal to one another. My wife created a delicious dish last night and added it into her tracker. It would of been cool if she could text it to me instead of me having to look it up on my app. But that’s just me, maybe I’m being lazy lol And asking too much from a FREE low carb tracker app. Great app!!",

Ok after working with the new app again I see the problem...in the old app you could set the serving size to what you were actually eating in the new app I cant do that ...even after support told me where to locate the “setting” it doesn’t work...PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD VERSION IT WAS AWESOME THIS IS NOT!!!,

There have been lots of improvements since I last used CM. The free version is a good way to test if you like it and the premium is not overly expensive for a year and I highly recommend it if you’re serious about losing weight and watching your carb content. I love that I can easily copy foods from one day to the next. I’ve uploaded recipes of the net which is super simple too. This app makes it very easy to track and know what your carb load is.,

I don’t it’s appropriate perhaps to name them. But, you’re not having to manually enter every item, every time. Massive time saver. There are so many other great features, but I’ve found my app. Only thing I don’t like are the colors used in the app, in the grand scene of thing, it means nothing compared to its functionality.

I cannot count the number of times that this app has saved me from eating a portion of some food that I thought was okay.  The “Scan” function is awesome.  The only complaint that I have is the erroneous carb info that someone entered for a barcode that made me cringe when it calculated me to be over my carb limit for the day...  but the app allowed me to enter the correct info directly from the label as well as submit a revision through the app.  I am truly appreciating this app.,

Having to keep my macros in my head or jotted down on yet another random piece of paper that would surely get lost doesn’t work for me. This app has been a lifesaver for that!

It keeps me accountable and on track with my food. I use the scanner at the grocery store to check food items, and looking up foods at restaurants to make sure I stay within my numbers. This is my 3rd week on keto and my first week using the app. The app shows me what’s keto and not but isn’t restrictive as long as I stay in my number range. I don’t feel like I’m on a diet, I feel like I’m more aware and this app helps me do that! Invest in the app! You’ll love it! 👍💪",

229,5,2019-10-04T15:55:57.000Z,Finland fan,Best app for ketogenic lifestyle,"This app is absolutely the best you'll find for tracking macros on a keto diet. The list of foods and brands is extensive but if you don't find one you're looking for, it's super easy to add it by creating a custom food or even a custom recipe. With the help of Carb Manager I've lost 32 pounds in 11 weeks and I feel great. Just make sure you create an account because if you use the app without creating an account, at some point you'll lose what you've been tracking with the exception of foods you have added to the database. This is a VERY valuable tool if you've opted for a ketogenic lifestyle.","Hello and thank you for your review! We're happy to say that may of the raw, common foods and ingredients that are used in recipes are available on Carb Manager for logging. However, we will absolutely recommend to include Finnish foods as part of relevant upgrades for the future. If we decide to move forward with this we will absolutely let you know!"
230,4,2018-01-11T00:59:33.000Z,Junesdestiny,Great app,"I love the colors, the charts, the bar graphs, and the pictures. You can even add your own pictures to recipes or meals that you create! This app has a lot of great features. Being able to track carbs, fiber, net carbs, fat, and calories easily laid out in a bar graph or wheel is very convenient. The app is easy to use and has some great features like being able to track measurements such as ketones, glucose, and I believe body measurements. I do wish they had some features that would make it even better such as reminders to log meals, reminders to log measurements, and a feature that one could use to easily copy a previous meal from a former meal.",
231,5,2018-03-21T19:19:53.000Z,calbarkat,Almost perfect,"I would love to be able to select the vitamin while under the “in depth” column and be taken to a page with the percentage of that vitamin broken down by the food that accumulated that total. For example, if I’m at 60% vitamin A, I would like to be able to select it and see what foods got me to that 60%. It would help me identify what I need to incorporate more or less in my daily diet to insure I’m getting the best possible ratio of nutrients.",

Great Customer Service!,"Update: have had some trouble with the app, but developers have always come through to fix any issues I may be experiencing.  Fits my needs and for that I thank them.","Hi there, thanks for getting in touch. If you previously paid for the app, then you should be able to access all nutrition and meal level data. Please contact us via the support center and we'll get that fixed for you."
233,5,2019-05-01T18:09:28.000Z,Knotnow,Great app,"This app is easy to use, and has been very educational. It has been guiding me in my new effort to go Keto, which is the opposite of my previous lifestyle, which i used to think was very health-conscious.  The carb content of some foods is surprising. The way things add up over the day is interesting. I am tip-toeing my way, hopefully to better health and i am grateful for the help of this app. So many apps like this are charging monthly fees.  I cannot see that they could be doing a better job, and this one is, thankfully, free. I am pretty sure this app can help you to be more nutritionally savvy too.  Here's to our health!",
234,5,2019-05-07T11:41:27.000Z,Gramna Deb,Carb Manager Tracker,"I am a Type 2 diabetic and started using this app about a week ago. Although it takes time to input my specific foods for tracking, it’s well worth it since I can just type in my specific food in the search bar and choose to add it and tweak it as needed (portion size). Doing this makes tracking more accurate than any diet plan I’ve been on. I challenge myself to get as close to my limits without going over. You can keep track of other things like exercise and water intake and look at progress through the reports it generates. I love this app.",
235,5,2020-05-05T10:45:27.000Z,Justshavon,Best tracking app ever,"I’ve had several tracking apps but this one is hands down best.  It tracks everything I need and more and makes low carb and keto easy.  I started the Atkins plan, which I’m also enjoying but their app isn’t nearly as intuitive.  This app gives me the info I need to customize my diet the way I want - kind of a Atkins/keto hybrid - and its working!  Cravings out the door and I’m able to stay within my limits.  I’ve lost about 12 pounds in the last 2 weeks.  For the first time I feel I can confidently say that this plan is one I can incorporate as a lifestyle.  Thank you!!",

237,1,2020-03-10T01:13:15.000Z,xoML,So much potential—just won’t work,"I am so disappointed with this app. I excitedly paid $29 for the year subscription, then became so frustrated just trying to get it to launch. I’m tech-saavy with an always up-to-date iPhone, reliable carrier (bill paid!), good signal, solid WiFi. I know a good internet connection. This app consistently spins and spins telling me, “trying to open, please check internet connection” etc. The occasional times it will open, navigating its cluttered user interface is just exasperating. I had such high hopes because the app seemed comprehensive and mirrored my lifestyle desires and intentions. It has so much potential—just won’t work reliably. Apple would not refund my purchase even though I explained my frustrations and having it just few months or so.","Hi xoML, and thanks for sharing your experience. Sorry to hear you're experiencing some loading issues for your device. That's definitely not normal behavior. Please email us at support@carbmanager.com so we can offer a hand and get you back into your account without any hiccups.

238,4,2020-03-04T01:32:44.000Z,i8astar,Love the app hate that is does not always open,"So far I love the app. It’s making my life a lot easier to calculate net carbs and track net carbs, fat and calories. The database of food is great and I love that you can add edits.  The camera scans quick and delivers results! I like the breakdown chart and you can change views from what you have left to what you have eaten.",
239,1,2020-10-15T22:18:25.000Z,Msllllll,Not user friendly at all !,"I’m so sorry I signed up for the premium, as it looked like many useful extras, but boy was I wrong. Most of the premium features are not compatible with my device...I have the newest I phone. To look up basic recipes is a joke, the internet feature shows no items, when clearly when I get on the internet I find tons of the same recipes I search in the app. Can not figure out how to add measurements, although that looks to be a feature. I literally have to google recipes and manually add in the ingredients. Even a basic recipe just shows variations of the food that is nothing like I’m trying to add. If I could give this 0 stars I would, wish I had tried the one month plan first. I’ll stick with the FREE My fitness pal, does so much more and so easy and user friendly. 👎👎👎","Hi, and thanks for taking the time to leave us a review!

240,5,2018-06-20T04:22:56.000Z,Kona Biker,Great Help!!!,"This is a wonderful tool for those following their macros to stay in dietary ketosis. I use Loseit! and it’s much better laid out but this has the net carb and diabetic (I am) carb content which I very much like. The lacking feature, unless I missed how to do this, is being able to click on each separate meal and see the ratio pie chart so that I can see if I need to add or take away foods to meet my macros for fat/protein/carbs. This app would be complete with that ability and because it’s missing I still have to use Loseit! App to plan my meals because it allows separate meal carb/fat/protein viewing.",
241,5,2019-04-23T19:49:53.000Z,ebdb13,User friendly and intuitive,"I’ve only been using it for a week or so, but so far I like it a lot! Very user friendly, easy to find what you’re looking for, and decent to look at too. I like the pie chart that adjusts throughout the day, and the at-a-glance preview of carbs in any item. I like it a lot better than My Fitness Pal which I found cumbersome to use when tracking macros as opposed to primarily calories. It doesn’t have a lot of bells & whistles, or special features at the free level, but it does exactly what I need—tracks macros with a clean easy to use interface.",
242,5,2020-08-23T21:07:27.000Z,GabyJaz13,Perfect app for me,I just started the Keto Diet. This app is just what I needed. I bought the paid app and couldn’t be happier. It scans products for a full nutritional profile that are easily added into the daily tracking.  It also has EXCELLENT recipes that have a wide range of food choices.,

I thought I was eating all of the right things, but just wasn’t progressing.  I downloaded and started tracking my food and trying to match the macros pie as closely as possible, and I was amazed that I was able to drop nearly 8 lbs that week!  I am so inspired by the functionality of it, and I love the many recipes I can find - oh! And the fact that you can drop an outside recipe link into the app and it will calculate from it for you is immeasurably helpful!    I cannot express enough how much I love this!",

I can pretty much customize make my own meal and diet plans along with discovering the myriad of awesome and tasty recipes! I was only going to try it for a month and then cancel, but I’m so impressed I’m upgrading to the annual. No matter what your goals, weight loss, health and wellness, build muscle, gain weight etc. I highly recommend trying this app out.  This allows you to measure just about anything health and diet related. I’ve never seen anything this in depth and advanced. Kudos to whoever developed this app!",
248,5,2019-10-19T14:03:11.000Z,SunLover4,Love the App!,"I’ve only been using the app for a few days now for the Keto Diet, but this app is extremely helpful for tracking your daily macro goals.  It’s easy to use, huge food library, lots of great recipes (with nutritional info listed and ready to plug into your daily numbers), and lots of tools to monitor your progress.  I have used My Fitness Pal for years, and this app is similar to that app but may end up being my favorite of the two.  I especially love the scan feature that loads your foods by their barcode.  It is such a timesaver!  This app is very user friendly.",
249,5,2019-07-17T13:37:44.000Z,Tapertem,Premium is worth it!,Keto was really hard for me and my husband at first because I felt like I was constantly searching on Pinterest for recipes or making the same two or three things over and over again. I love love love the recipes option. They have all different types of meals you can look at including snacks and they make it super easy to log into your day. This has been a huge game changer for us in tracking our food. My only request would be that they let you make a shopping list based on the food you plan to eat that week.,

She had great success with it and when I reached out to her about starting and assisting me with my own research, this App was the first thing she suggested!",

I literally just complained about it and today it’s completely fixed! I’m thinking it must have been included in the new update, but either way great job! I’m stoked to use this app. Look up foods yourself though. You can’t always trust what’s published. Unless I’m on the go, I verify each one and then just save that one to “my foods” so I don’t have to keep referencing, but you definitely want to in the beginning. Other than that, this app is amazing! Love LOVE it.","Hey there, it sounds like you might be tracking total carbs instead of net carbs. Please go to Settings - App Settings and select ""Net Carbs"" in the ""Carbs to Track"" field. This will make it so net carbs display on your daily log meal totals. Hope this helps!"
253,5,2020-06-12T19:36:05.000Z,Pamiek,Great app for following a Keto diet,This app is very easy to use. I chose to give the paid version a try because there are many more options available (tons recipes for each meal plus suggested meal plans). It even tracks your exercise and steps.,

Highly recommended for anyone who wants to know how they are measuring up to their daily goals. ONE FIX NEEDED: it would be great if you provided the “confetti” for MEETING macros, not for being under. Being under on something so important as macros should not be encouraged!","Hi, and thanks for the awesome review!

257,5,2021-05-18T23:15:41.000Z,GingieGirl,Beyond useful! Already dropping pounds!,I purchased the full app and I’m on my way to weight loss and better health. The ability to log in my food with great ease and then track my meals/snacks had been a major benefit. The “ultimate” for me is the macros calculator which allows me to adjust my ratios (carbs/protein/fat/calories) if I plateau or feel the need to change my course. I am so happy that I saw this App mentioned in Women’s World magazine. By downloading this app you have nothing to lose but unwanted weight and with this app it is unbelievably simple. I highly recommend the full App version.,

While the update does improve some aspects of the app and make it look nicer, it seems to have slowed it way down. It now takes a long time to load on my phone. In addition, I have noticed that when editing recipes there is a major bug. When editing an existing recipe and trying to edit an ingredient or add one the app will suddenly go to the loading screen and then revert to the daily tracker screen, with none of the changes saved. It has gotten to the point where the app is almost unusable.","Hi there, and thanks for taking the time to leave a review! The issue you are referring to with editing recipes has been resolved.

For the past few years as a Type 2 diabetic I’ve used another app to count calories and carbs. Even though I was diligent my blood sugar readings constantly averaged around 150. After creating goals with “diabetic carbs” using this app my decision making became different and my results changed. For the last two weeks since using this app my blood sugar readings have been between 90 and 120 but mostly right around 100. Thank you.,

It is so easy to use and I am able to track everything that goes into my mouth. It’s incredibly helpful (and motivating) to see my progress. Additionally, I like the ability to scan items in the grocery store to see if it’s an item I would like to add to my diet. I recommended this app to four other people and now we are all supporting each other! I highly recommend this app! It’s a big thumbs up👍🏻 and FIVE stars!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",
263,3,2018-10-14T16:35:49.000Z,2coolbaby,Free Preview should be available,"It’s just a very basic carb counter at the free version. But before committing to the pro version, they should provide a week free preview to see if its actually what we want. I sure don’t want to spend $9 to preview it or the full annual amount only to find out it doesn’t do what I am hoping for or if it does, it does it badly. I need to be able to import recipes from Big Oven and ensure it does the nutritional correctly. Can we edit our shopping list? Easily? Just lots of questions that a free preview would answer and if it’s as good as they claim, then I would be happy to pay the annual amount. But an app that won’t offer a free preview is sketchy.

This app helps me keep track of how many carbs I am eating and to make choices that keep me to the daily serving limits my nutritionist recommends.  I can even work in occasional sugary treats as long as I log them and am aware of their impact on my carbohydrate servings.  It’s easier than WW used to be because I don’t have to shift the math to some made up points system.  I can just use what’s on the nutrition labels and focus on the carbohydrates.  I occasionally push myself to include more protein when the macros chart indicates I am not getting as much as I should.",

I tried the keto diet using my other app but I just couldn’t stick to it. Now, I’m able to easily track and see my progress which has given me the strength and willpower to stick with it. The meal ideas are very helpful and delicious too! I’ve been on keto for 8 days now and have lost 7.2 pounds! Mostly water weight I’m sure but that means I’m doing it right all thanks to this app. I’m super excited and thankful for this helpful app.",

I love that, unlike many other apps, I can add as many items as I would like to each meal and can create many custom meals and foods. This would be a 5 star review if it wasn’t for the restrictions created for the free version. All of the recipes look lovely on this app, and having access to them would make my life so much easier, but you have to pay. I also can’t keep track of any other measurement than my weight, which for me is fine, but I know many others wouldn’t be okay with that.",
268,5,2020-09-04T17:16:30.000Z,phalan the just,Excellent App,"Once you get used to moving around this app it puts the weight watchers app to shame.  You can do so much with it especially if you upgrade.  Which is very reasonable.  And they have sales frequently.   If your a beginner at keto, which I was, this helped guide me through the start and macros.   The better I get at keto the more features I’m discovering.  The scan system has a huge database of foods and has an easy add feature.",
269,1,2021-02-23T02:26:40.000Z,AIBrownie,Used to be great!,"The old carb manager was the best app out there for keto before the upgrade. I really liked the feature where you could plan out your meals on the calendar- yes you can make meal plans with the upgrade but it’s not at all user friendly and so hard to do. It was nice to be able to plan my macros exactly for the next week or two in advance because as a full time student and mom to two toddlers, I don’t have time to do Keto on the fly. Please at least give the option of going back to the old version. So many of the items scanned on the barcode that use to show up no longer show up any more. It’s incredibly frustrating. Used to love this app but I am seriously considering finding a different one once by subscription ends in a couple of weeks.",

A friend turned me in to CarbManager 8 days ago and I love it! The fact that I am still enthusiastically using it says a lot for me. Good behavior that gets recognized, gets repeated. That’s what I find I like about this app. Easy to use, easy to read, easy to find what I am looking for. I love it, not to mention that I stay within my limits easily because I love using it and I challenge myself to make better choices. This app helps me do just that, and I am grateful!!",

The ability to scan food labels and adjust potion amounts down to 1/8th of a portion makes adding your food a quick and painless activity. Track your water for the day, your exercise and so much more! The encouragement I get from seeing my macros below my max levels for the day keeps me motivated. And knowing when I’m “close” to my limits for the day helps me walk away form that “one more slice”  to make sure I keep moving forward with my new way of eating for life. Get this app NOW.

I have tried and tried to 'create an account' but it will not allow me to. The feature pops up constantly during the day to do this now I just cancel it out.

This one took me a minute to figure out, but after I got all the bugs worked out I love it it is kept me on track and keeps me honest! I even splurged for the premium and I’m glad I did because the recipes on there and the comments about people that refuse the recipesAre very helpful! Way to go guys! Down from 130 to 111 today thanks to you♥️",

However I have shifted my macro goals and this app is still the best out there for calorie management, macro goals, and micro nutrient tracking.   It has a great social aspect that has helped me and a friend keep each other accountable.   The customer support is quick to reply and very friendly and helpful.   All around this is the best app for anyone trying to track their caloric intake, to help meet goals, and become a healthier person.   Thank you for all you guys do and the new update is awesome!",
277,1,2021-03-27T15:23:42.000Z,HC240,2021 update is terrible,"Used to love this app, where I pay for premium version, but changes for 2021 make it less usable. New version is aesthetically nice, but navigation is cumbersome and requires a lot of scrolling and swiping to get the screen you want. Since updating in Feb, the app reads data from Apple Health but no longer writes data, thereby wrecking my use of not just one app but two! I’ve tried troubleshooting tips and they don’t work. In theory the Graphing button in carb manager would allow me to see progress over time (weekly, monthly, etc), but the circles for each data point make the graphs unreadable. I’d prefer the summary column graphs that Apple Health displays — but I can no longer use AH to see nutrition data because CM doesn’t write data! Please fix these issues!!!","Hi, and thanks for taking the time to leave us a review! Since you posted it, many fixes and improvements have been implemented by our Development Team. CM does continue to import nutritional data to AH. If you have any questions or continuing issues, please reach out to us directly within the app or email us at support@carbmanager.com. We are very happy to assist! :)"
278,4,2021-02-11T14:58:21.000Z,Fifth Angel,Loved the app until the recent update,"I’ve been using Carb Manager for over 3 years now and I loved it until the recent update. They’ve made it really hard to track your food. Before the update I could just easily add my food from the recent history. Now, those frequently used items don’t show. When I type the name of food it doesn’t show the frequently used ones but rather some random items I’ve never used. It’s super frustrating. Also, since the update the app is glitchy and it takes longer to open and track items. Very disappointed!",
279,3,2021-02-06T04:54:24.000Z,Kriddledub,Good! But buggy,"Really like the app for tracking macros. Seems to have lots of foods available so I don’t always have to scan in or create a recipe but love that these options are available. They have member recipes and that’s a great resource. HELLA buggy tho!!!! Sometimes it just won’t load any foods on the search page. It’s like it can’t pull anything from the server. One time it said my internet wasn’t connected but I could use the internet outside the app. Today the last 4 days of food tracking disappeared. Sometimes I just get a spinner that just spins and page won’t respond. If it keeps this up, I’ll have to try another option. Whomp whomp.",
280,5,2017-08-26T01:18:47.000Z,chipmunky1,The BEST carb counter,"I've lost over 38 pounds using Carb Manager on a ketogentic diet. It's been my most valuable tool in losing weight. I've tried all of the other carb tracking apps -- this one is by far the best. I think the most impressive feature is the ability to log foods by ""saying"" them. It's smart enough to understand what you said and find the matching foods. The food database is enormous. I rarely come across a food that they don't have, and even then I can enter the info manually. I also like the recipe builder feature and barcode scanner. Highly recommended.",
281,4,2019-01-15T19:00:51.000Z,Tonytatt1,Great app for Keto diet,"This is a great app. Just plug in your age, weight and how much weight you’d like to lose per week. It will tell you what your caloric intake, but most importantly your carb intake should be to attain your goals. I would give this app 5 stars if it automatically adjusted the calorie and carb numbers as you lost weight. Instead you have to go into settings and change everything to get the calories and carbs to adjust to your weight loss. Also this app isn’t compatible with workout apps like Fitbod or your activity app. If it worked with those apps this would be a home run. As is it’s still a great app though.",
282,5,2019-01-25T13:15:08.000Z,Squirrel217,The premium version is well worth the price,"I had been using the free version and liked it. But I took the plunge and upgraded to the premium version. The added features plus the meal plans are definitely worth it. I started following one of the meal plans and have lost 7 lbs my first week. They are easy to load into my phone or iPad and then all I have to do is accept that food for it to go onto my daily log. It has definitely kept me on my plan. Also, all of the recipes have been yummy. Really enjoying the variety of fat bomb recipes.",

I gladly paid the yearly fee because it was less than my previous app, and it has more options!  I love that I can also note my glucose and ketones. I can make notes on how I’m feeling or how a good affected me.  One of my favorite options when you pay for the full app is the recipes. You can customize the recipe, get step by step instructions, and add the macros to you day so easily.",
284,5,2019-06-13T03:34:42.000Z,SRJLGC,Great app and worth the upgrade,"I love this app. It is so easy to use and the upgrade features are well worth the money. I can import recipes so easily and it figures out all of the nutrition for me! I was having difficulty getting that feature to work with Pinterest but when I copied the actual website url into the import feature it has worked every time! Love that is syncs with my fitbit and the recipes are fantastic...makes sticking to the diet much easier.  I would (and do) highly recommend this, the free or upgraded version are both great.",

I mainly stay in the recipe section just typing in a single ingredient of something I have in the fridge and I can build a recipe around it with all the creative ideas in this app.  Great job creating this app.",

The only flaw I have found is that when you click on the tab for the ""share recipe"", or if you are in the App Settings and click on ""Share this App"", it forces a hard close on the App itself.

I had to lose weight and fast, and the thought of counting carbs and calories was making me anxious. I found this app and I’m in love. It’s making Keto so easy for me, and less boring. I just had coconut flour pancakes for breakfast. Not listed in app? No problem! Easy and accurate add in. Just scan and add and viola! No more worrying about whether or not you had too many carbs, protein, calories, etc. Give it a try. I’m sure that like me, you’re going to love it 😊",

This one  was the winner!!!! It lets you customize and log as much as you want for free, I’m sure we (hubby and I) will eventually get the paid version once we start doing more exercise. There are some brands that aren’t always correct when you scan/search but it’s easy to edit it right then and there. BEST APP for KETO!

No more stressing. The app is full of recipes and suggestions ..it also counts your water and your exercise ..everything you need to be successful on your weight-loss journey is at the top of your fingers..This app is guaranteed to help you get back on track.,

I like that I can put in a food even before I eat it to see how that will affect my overall numbers. Then I delete it if I decide to go in a different direction. The only thing I’m not quite sure about is the numbers they give me for my total goal, for instance, 30 carbs as a daily goal. That’s way too high for me. There might be a way to change that. I’m just a little new with this. Maybe writing a review a little too soon.",

After 3 days of use, I tried to log a food and a screen, giving my no options but to purchase the upgrade, appeared.... I could back out to the previous screen, but continued to get the same screen on subsequent attempts to log food. I tried logging out then back in... no change.

There are a lot of nice functions in the free version but the premium version is even better. I can set different macros goals for different days, get Keto “grades” on foods that I scan to help identify if it’s good to eat on my diet and the emails they send are very informative and encouraging. I feel like I have a lot of support from the app creators in my weight loss goals. This is the best weight loss/diet management app I’ve used so far, even better than Lifesum and MyFitnessPal.",

I have used My Fitness Pal and the Atkins app, and I find this one far superior. I can easily track my net carbs, and it seems to track macros well too. You can also track calories. There seems to be a huge database of food and recipes, and the scanner works great as well. This may be silly, but I love the pictures of the foods as you look them up. My only quibble is that the net carbs round up if it's, say, 2.5 carbs, to the whole carb. Other than that, I think it's great!",

I used another email today to get a new account started and the same thing happened. I have paid for a premium membership and I’m not able to use the site.

Two most used features are gone. I cannot set up to see daily percentage ratio of carbs, proteins and fats - it only shows me how many grams out of my daily norm I had. And also when you save favorite recipes there's no easy way to look through your saved favorites - they are all mixed up with favorite foods and your own recipes - I need a separate folder or tab where favorite recipes are collected.

322,4,2018-02-25T19:01:16.000Z,sdarosa,Carb Manager bugs,"I have recommended this app to several people because it’s the first app I have come across that is carb driven.  It’s awesome!  HOWEVER, there are some bugs that frustrates me.  The slowness to respond to searches and the times it times out make it frustrating that I walk away from it.  When you get to this point you tend to forget items and then your counts are off.  Then what is the sense of the app.?  I was thinking about switching to premier but I won’t until these get fixed.",
323,5,2018-07-10T18:07:52.000Z,brdwygurl,Everything I was looking for,I was a long-time user of MFP but became frustrated and unhappy with the app.  This is exactly what I was looking for!,
324,5,2018-11-30T20:51:36.000Z,Tinkartist,Very helpful,I’ve been practicing sloppy Keto for about 6 weeks. I don’t own a scale -which is s good thing because I would use it too often. But I am losing weight and feeling better and people are commenting about my weight loss. Carb manager let’s me test myself - I’m getting quite good at keeping my carb intake around 30. When I use it my days are more like 20! It’s quite helpful. This is a lifestyle not a diet and the app is a good tool for reaching your trim self. In general carbs are in every packaged /processed food and most of it is bad for your health.,
325,5,2020-10-12T00:24:08.000Z,WendyNichols,"Count Health, not Calories","I like Carb Manager because eating right is more that just tracking my calories per day. I can actually see what foods I need to eat to meet my protein, fat and carb needs.  These are called “ Macro” food units. My doctor told me how much protein I need per day, so I make sure to meet that “macro” unit per day.  I never liked counting calories. Boring. But I’m very interested in making healthy protein choices. I also like to know how many carbs and fat  I eat. It’s easy to switch certain food for better choices using this app.",

As soon as I started meeting my daily fat requirement of 70%, I got over the hump instantly. This app is great for tracking macros and keeping notes. I even use it to decide if I want to eat something before I eat it. I’ll plug in the food and if it throws off my day I’ll decide not to eat it. Or maybe it eat it in a different quantity. VERY helpful. The premium version has even more great features.","Thanks for the super review! We're happy to hear you're enjoying and fully taking advantage of our app's features!

327,5,2020-01-29T12:05:14.000Z,DJDitges,Love CarbMgr with one exception,"The recipe import is outstanding, however, it would be nice if it was possible to move the ingredients to another location. I usually modify some recipe ingredients to make them more low carb or to specify products. This usually requires me to delete old product then add replacement product. When adding products, they go to the bottom of ingredients list. It’s a bit cumbersome to have a fully converted recipe without having to input every ingredient if I just created a new recipe. I hope this makes sense.",

However this recent update is clumsy to use. It takes longer to find foods and the search often brings up nonrelevant results. It doesn’t list the food you have added recently, so you need to search more often. And, when you do search, results take longer to pop up than they used to. In other words, the update is not an improvement and needs work. I am only giving it 3 stars and then that because I used to love the app.",

With the help of this amazing app I've been able to log all my daily food intake and lose 120 pounds in the past year and a half. The app is very user friendly and has so much information at your fingertips. This has been one CRUCIAL key to my weight loss. Thank you, Carb Manager for helping me track my food intake with ease!

331,5,2018-07-14T23:47:36.000Z,Zachs music,Beginner Keto,I’m a beginner at Keto and I’ve always heard about the macros you have to keep up with.  This has always kept me intimidated and shied me away from ever trying Keto.  I always just thought it was to hard and to much work to do all the math.  My wife asked around online about which was the best Keto app to use so we gave it a try.  That being said I absolutely love this app and the ease of use.  I’m on day 6 of Keto and I’m down 9.2 lbs!  This app made it all possible.  I love putting in all my foods and nailing a perfect day every day.  This app is my best friend lol.,
332,5,2018-12-21T12:29:44.000Z,jtobison,Key to Keto!,"This app has been indispensable in my transition to a ketogenic diet. The main screen is a great visualization of where you stand on macros and bio marker measurements. The nutritional database seems very comprehensive and the food scanning feature works well. The detail reporting is also comprehensive. My only minor complaint is the interface for blood pressure measurements is clunky - you have to enter systolic, then use a pull down to switch to diastolic, and enter the second number. So I use BP Companion to track BP separately. Highly recommend the app though.",
333,4,2019-01-23T16:33:26.000Z,Snazzy snap,I like this app except...,"So far this has been a great app. The only thing that is not super user friendly as other apps is the lists of foods. Other apps you can type in a few things and the lists that comes up includes all of the things. For example, a Wendy’s cheeseburger, other apps you type that in it comes up with the Wendy’s cheeseburger and the Wendy’s cheeseburger, no bun. Since this is a low carb app it should automatically bring that option up. You shouldn’t have to type the whole thing in all the time. I’m fat because I’m lazy I don’t like doing extra work.",

Good apps but you have to manually count and track Net carbs. That isn’t helpful if you’re on a Carbless/Carb Free diet. This app calculates a lot for you, give you the exact calculations as you’re logging a food (shows what you have left.) Great options for Premium-Haven’t upgraded yet. Kind of pricey options! The interface itself can use a facelift or new design. But still 5 STARS because the functionality is SUPER!",

I have lost 10 pounds in the past 3 weeks and I don’t think I could have done it without this app. I paid for premium mostly because I wanted the full access to view my nutrient intake to make sure I am still remaining healthy. The only thing is I wish there was an option to easily add fasting days including the times. If there is a way to do that, can someone please let me know? Thanks!",

I think it should be an easy fix to show all of the micronutrients bars in one place vs. having to flip through each of them individually from a drop down so I’m very surprised this is not already a feature.,"Hi, Octopuscandysticks and thanks for your review! We hear you loud & clear, and we're currently working on a new version of the app to be released soon that will revamp our UI and how we display Macros as well as Micronutrients. Until then, select Settings-Diet Goals-Micronutrients to track your daily nutrients, and you can customize your intake per day. You can also see an analysis of your Micronutrients in Daily Log-In Depth. For any other questions please reach out to us in-app. Thanks!"
338,5,2021-01-05T23:39:11.000Z,Barleypopmaker,Excellent app for tracking,"Carb manager is by far my favorite app for tracking macros. My needs change as I rotate between maintenance and light losing so being able to quickly and easily adjust my options is a bonus. When I lost a bulk of my weight it was with carb manager. That was 85 pounds and 3 years ago. I still use it to this day to stay on track. The premium features are nice and I’ve done it a couple times, but the base free version is invaluable to anyone tracking macros especially carbs or net carbs.",
339,2,2021-02-09T16:52:47.000Z,TPete1217,Challenged with recent update,"I used to LOVE this app but recent changes have really impacted my experience.  Two changes in particular that have changed.  The fact that I can no longer see total and net calories on dashboard- it only shows me net and I have to go elsewhere to get total or add myself.  Also the serving size does not allow you to add what you want, ie today I tried to enter 1/3 avocado and I could not enter - it only allowed me to enter 1/4 or 1 1/4.  I have noticed with custom added foods the serving size works differently than it used to.  Would love to see fixes for these changes.  Lastly trying to find entry for ketones and glucose was a chore.  Not as user friendly as prior version.",

They had it advertised as $3 something a month for twelve months so I figured hey $3 and some change a month wouldn’t hurt just to see if I really like the app. So upon clicking on the 12 month subscription and signing up, I receive my receipt from apple stating that they charged me the full years price!!! No where on the app did it say that you pay the full price it said PER MONTH! So I’m really not understanding why they charged me the full amount instead of the per month price. Something just isn’t right!!","Hey SB340, thanks for contacting us. Premium is USD $39.99 per year, $16.49 per 3 months, or $8.49 per month.

Second, I would like to be able to enter a recipe, and then add a fraction of that recipe to my tracker. When I make a recipe, it usually has 6 to 8 portions.

I’d consider paying for this app if there was a 1-time fee. I don’t do any subscriptions. There are too many features in the paid version that I don’t need such as recipes and meal plans. Overall, great app. Very happy.",

My daughter decided to try keto with me and got this app, so I did too. This app made such a difference. I've lost seven pounds in 2 weeks and this is another thing I can share with my daughter : ) I love this app! Especially like the copy function. My seven ingredient coffee can be copied as my breakfast to my afternoon snack or even to another day, no need to find each ingredient again. Thanks so much for this app!",
373,5,2019-01-12T12:30:38.000Z,Mrs. Coli,Carb manager rocks!,I love this app! Just started a week ago and am finding that the Keto diet is easy to keep track of using this. I do not have the premium package (yet.) I like the option of keeping your favorite foods on the list plus adding ones you or someone else have created. Being able to edit foods and amounts to check your current daily numbers is great. The option to copy foods onto other days. The ability to scan....I could go on and on. Thank you for this wonderful app!,
374,4,2019-03-14T04:28:19.000Z,BuxomG,Great app,"Lots of features and lots to do if you want to get into the nitty gritty details of your diet. The recipes are plentiful and the ability to make your own custom recipe is wonderful. Only 4 stars because there is no feature to save a recipe. You have to favorite the recipe and then it stores it in the exact same place as your favorite individual food items. That's a lot to scroll through when you've been saving recipes to make in the future. If they figure out a way to save recipes without having to make them a favorite, I'd give 5 stars.",

This app gives me the ability to track exact carbs, proteins, fats, sugars, calories and many other statistics.   The premium has the scanner I needed and access to recipes plus a great way to see your progress in more depth!  It was worth the extra $30 a year for me to get the entire suite available on this app.  I love the app! In fact I like this app better than my WW app!",

It helps me plan ahead so I know exactly what I’ll be eating that day/week; it helped tremendously this weekend when I was out of town! Staying in a hotel and depending on restaurant food was my weekend but thankfully I had this app to help me make smart decisions and plan ahead so I didn’t make any mistakes in a hurry with our server! Plus, I found some great gas station snacks I could eat on the road trip! Love love love this app!",

I have deleted and reinstalled the app, it doesn't help. It tells me to check my Internet connection. My Internet connection is fine, everything else works. I'm not going to renew this, and will probably cancel it early, because it does no good when it won't even load. On the few occasions when it does finally open after spinning for a long time, it just brings me to a non-functional new day. I can't enter anything, I can't scroll to another day.  I just re-installed it yet again, and it won't even open.","Hi, and thanks for sharing your experience.

Graphics are nice and I played with it and decided to buy the Premium so I could sync with my Fitbit which I love. I paid $50 bucks only to find out the data flows one way. From Fitbit to Carb Manager but carb manager doesn’t read the food so you get nothing but calories in gross numbers. I also understood I could log blood sugar readings and insulin. Never found it. To top it off, just now, for the first time in 5 years with Fitbit their app quit logging data input. I cancelled my subscription only to find out it’s cancelled for next year, not a refund for poor performance which I deserve. So Developers... if you read this I want a refund.",

However, no matter whether we are connected through our home Internet or cellular many times the app now takes forever to open or simply does not. I am pretty certain it is not an Internet or cell phone configuration issue. Maybe we reaches a data retention limit or something... Note: we are not yet on a subscription.

I’m just using it to track my macros and this is hands-down the best app I’ve tried. It has so many pre-entered foods and nutrition facts and varying portions with easy to use sliders to adjust serving sizes and serving measurement types. For example it has cups, grams, ounces as well as stalks and inches like if you’re eating celery or asparagus.",
381,5,2018-06-30T00:42:33.000Z,TraciMo,Great app for low carb high fat diet,I use this to track my macros and I love how I can import recipes (after paying for the upgrade). The only problem I’ve noticed though is sometimes it shows the macros of downloaded recipes than different from what the recipe shows. If I want to though I can easily enter the ingredients I actually used to make the item and it will show accurate results.,

I just turned 50 and started going through menopause. This app is amazing.  It has opened my eyes to how little I have to eat to rack up the carbs and sugar and calories. I’ve lost 11 pounds and six days already!  Just started my exercise regiment on day 4 and lost two more pounds in the following two days.  On my way to surely hit my goal to lose 30 pounds in 90 days!!!!!,

I did pay for the upgrade for the year and the extras you get are very helpful. My complaint is how often this app crashes. Even closing it and reopening it does not work. I have to shut down my phone and restart it, but even that does not always solve the problem. Been looking for customer support but cannot find contact info to report this. Could it be my phone? Possibly, but this is the only app that’s glitching right now. When it works, I love it! When this issue is resolved, I’d happily update my review to 5 stars!",

When looking at mayonnaise, I noticed that the numbers for 1/2 cup were NOT double of a quarter cup (and not even remotely close). Then I started to notice that the numbers for the grams of proteins and carbs were not adding up correctly in my daily total. Again, not even close. So its totally useless to do what it claims. You can’t manage your carbs when its a crap shoot if there is ANY accuracy at all. Third thing- I noticed when eating a Kind bar, that was the EXACT same size and flavor as listed in the app, that the carbs, protein and calories were wildly off. I would suggest getting a different app. I am.","Thank you for taking the time to review Carb Manager.

I tried to use Fitbit and Myfitness Pal with my Apple Watch and it never clicked right. This app syncs with my watch calories automatically. It’s also easy to track your Macro intake daily, the food you enter goes into the nutrition section of your health app. The only improvement I would suggest is to improve the water intake section. Allow to track ml instead of glasses and have a goal bar for it.",
386,4,2020-09-30T05:04:04.000Z,XenoSapien,"Great free app, but not perfect",I love this app! It’s fairly simple and easy you use. I find it very helpful to plan out whole entire days of meals days ahead which helps me stay on track.,

So I decided to look for an app. I found this one and am just thrilled. It’s easy to track and let’s me know if I am meeting my needs and how many macros I have left for the day... for free. Many things are premium only for meal plans and recipes and nutrient counting, but this is perfect for my needs— I am not using the premium upgrade at this time. I might, down the road.

Not to mention it’s impossible to find  logged food.  Please check the reviews from angry users. You won’t find a single person who’s happy with the new update.  If it’s not fixed and they don’t address the issue with their users who have used carb manager for years then it’s time to move on. Already downloaded 2 new apps to try,
389,1,2021-07-18T01:45:17.000Z,sillygirlnicky,Not happy about update,Before when I was using the app you used to be able to scan a food in the grocery store and it will tell you the food rating like saying avoid or moderation or good. Now when I scan items in the store it is extremely frustrating to not see the grade because that is what helped me the most. I reached out to customer support and never heard anything back. Is anybody else having these issues?It is a major buzz kill that it does not say this anymore. There are a lot of items in the store that you think would be keto friendly and when I scanned them and it says it’s not that helps me more than just seeing the macros that are posted now with this upgrade,"Hi there! We still have Keto Grades: Friendly (green) Limit (yellow) Strictly Limit (red) Avoid (red)- so you can still check the food items while you're grocery shopping!

I couldn’t imagine following this diet without a way to put my foods, calories, proteins, and Carbs into perspective. The great thing is that once you’ve plugged in a food, it’s saved and ready for you to click on it for another day. As the day goes on, the app generates how many carbs you have left in the bank. Also, if you plug in your exercises,  the app adds carbs back in if you feel like you need to use them. Easy to use and glad I found the app.",

The creators of this app really put a lot of thought into it. I was able to pick my macro ratios, what kind of diet I’d like and input any restrictions or allergies. My favorite part is the live graph of your daily macros. I’m able to see where I’m at and how much I have left as I’m imputing my food. I was so impressed with the app that I decided to subscribe to 3 months. Very worth it. The premium recipes are so yummy and easy!!",

However, This recent and stupid update is awful and makes it harder to navigate the app. I appreciate the clean and fresh layout but The layout is way too intricate for no reason.  Also, the nutrition labels on foods is INCORRECT now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That’s probably the worst part. Im in a Keto group and many of my fellow Keto people are so unhappy with this new update.

I really love how simple it is to track carbs, fat, fiber, and protein.  When I first got the app I was given the option to choose the type of diet.  I am on the keto diet.  The app gave me a breakdown of how many calories I should take in, how many grams of carbs, fat, and protein in a day in order to lose about 2 pounds per week.  I’m losing more than that because of the added exercise I engage in. I highly recommend this app.",

It's SUPER user friendly and intuitive. I especially like the ability to scan bar codes.  Every item I've scanned has been available. Also very useful is the function to copy meals from previous days.  I typically have the same salad for lunch.  I'm able to quickly copy the entire meal.

It tells me grams of fat, grams of protein and all the percentages that I need for macros. It even tells me how many calories that I’ve consumed for the day. And you can track water too.

They are very responsive to questions, etc. I would give it 5 stars if not for this print issue.",

The main things I do not like is that I can not multi-add my foods per my meals, just have to keep going back and forth between recently used and my foods. I also wish the recently used foods list was longer, I find within 3 days I have to re-scan my food. Lastly, I’ve had to add 3 foods to “my foods” which is fine, I understand there is a ton of food out there, I just have had more success in this with other apps.

It is easy to use and allows you to create recipes from your meals   Saves time in using the app when you have that same meal again. App lets you sync with a Fitbit and you can graph your weight and measurements and enter blood glucose levels to really see how your meal choices impact your blood sugar levels.

Eventually I sometimes come across them as double entries because of this. The carb counts are often wrong, and it rare that I can actually import a recipe.  This has always been an issue, but it is way worse now!  I am sticking with this app for now, only because I don’t want to start over again entering my recipes.

Unlisted foods can be suggested by users.,
419,5,2019-06-21T14:15:37.000Z,Meeee1122,Awesome,Overall I love this application it’s really easy to use the scan feature works perfectly and you can pretty much type in any food and it will come up. It would be nice if you could have a friend in the app that you share your results with and it would be nice if you can save a commonly used food example would be I make the same coffee every morning it would be nice to just save it and Collett my coffee instead of inputting the information every day,
420,5,2017-08-27T02:12:33.000Z,Davetydavedave,Great!,I went ahead and subscribed because I like the photo recognition (only 3 free). Still exploring all the features. The automatic calculation of nutrients and effective carbs is outstanding. The only thing I'm missing is a way to input items that aren't on the database. Another program I have used allows you to scan barcode snap photo of front and back nutritional info and submit to the database. Maybe I just haven't figured out how yet? Anyway it's great. Fairly pricey for full function. $$$,
421,5,2017-12-02T18:02:57.000Z,Faulk Yourself,Great app...if you pay for it,"This app has so many capabilities, but it’s very limited if you don’t pay for premium. They allow you “log” 12 items a day for free. What they really mean, is that you can “search” 12 items a day for free. I logged two items for breakfast and was using the app to search for something I could eat a restaurant, and it blocked me from being able to choose one unless I paid for it because I had already searched 10 items.",
422,4,2018-02-01T20:38:25.000Z,CathysTurn,I love the look of this app,Every food item has an icon that goes with it. I like that the graph is at the top of the page so I can see easily where I am for the day on my micros.,
423,5,2018-05-18T00:32:05.000Z,staaaaaaaaaaahp,The best for keto,"Doing keto for the first time and this app has been really helpful. I tried to use MFP but you can’t adjust your macros, which stinks when you’re very new at something. Well, according to the internet you can load some backdoor script into MFP to make it work but that was way more than I wanted to deal with. After researching, I found Carb Manager and am so happy I did. Gives me structure, motivation, and information all in one. Been using for a week and I’ve lost 6 pounds already.",
424,5,2018-10-07T18:46:53.000Z,Michaela2794,KETO diet TRY IT,"Started the Keto diet almost two weeks ago after a week of low carbs. Honestly, started after I realized I was eating absurd amounts of carbs. This app has been the keys to any level of success in this diet for me; 8lbs down. Helps keep me on track with setting my Ketogenic macros and having a large selection of nutrition values for the foods I’m actually eating. Didn’t have to buy the expansion for the app to have it be usable and effective but I’m considering it just to see if it can get any better.",
425,2,2018-11-17T22:34:34.000Z,PnutButta27,Not trustworthy,"It’s a decent app if all you’re looking at is carbs. But every day at every meal I have to change the calorie count of what I’m eating, especially for scanned foods, because it’s wrong in the app (it’s usually off by 10 calories). It’s gotten too frustrating for me and makes me think this app is not conducive for a long term commitment. I don’t have the time to constantly report foods and check if it’s correct. 10 calories might not seem like a big deal, but if we’re talking multiple foods on a daily basis, if it’s not caught it can really throw a wrench in your weight loss goals. Not cool. If they fixed this issue it would get a 5 star review from me.",
426,5,2019-03-08T13:40:08.000Z,SmmMO,Really Happy with Carb Manager,"I have used several other tracking apps over several years, but I am so glad I found this one.  Nice clear visuals and easy to locate data and options within the app.  It is the Best I found for easily tracking Net Carbs while following a Keto Diet.  Scanning foods is easy, quick and accurate.  Lots of customizing capabilities.  It easily linked up to my Fitbit, but it would be nice to have more fitness app options available, like Strava for biking for instance.",
427,4,2019-06-09T03:15:16.000Z,cadd19,Should include breastfeeding moms,I am just setting this up so I can’t speak on the overall user friendliness of the app but it seems easy to use. My only complaint at the moment is that there is no way to account for breastfeeding. The weight watchers program asks whether or not you are breastfeeding during set up and accounts for the extra calories needed in the points balance. It would be nice if this app would do that with the net carbs because a breastfeeding mother cannot diet the same way someone who isn’t breastfeeding can.,
428,4,2019-09-21T20:58:10.000Z,RachHa8579,Great app! Super helpful!,Love this app! It helps me track everything! Being able to put in recipes with all the nutritional info helps out so much! Makes my life so much easy doing this Keto lifestyle! What’s great is being able to create a recipe and sharing it with my husband or friend so we don’t have to enter in all the info individually all the time.,

430,5,2018-11-06T17:39:13.000Z,felianac,Love it,Right now I’m just using the simple version of it I haven’t purchased the upgrade for the app. But I still really love it because it helps me pay attention to what I’m putting into my body and it helps me understand and then that it was a visual to it to where I can see the numbers. And then I can modify things which I really like. So it makes life a little easier it makes it less complicated and it kind of doesn’t numbers for you so I think it’s great,
431,2,2019-04-16T16:01:24.000Z,smith16s,App crash & frequent glitches,"I had used this app in the past and upgraded to the Premium plan. I liked it well enough but stopped using it after awhile and let the premium plan end. Due to some dietary changes, I started using the app again just a few days ago and again upgraded to the Premium Plan. This time around, I’ve noticed that the app is very glitchy. Fields you should be able to type in don’t always work, upon opening the app it flashes in and out, and now - just a few days later after spending $30 to upgrade - I can’t even access the app to log my information! It just spins. So frustrating!",
432,5,2019-05-03T11:01:29.000Z,Joe .......,Great App,I read a lot of good feedback about this app so I decided to try it a few weeks ago. It is terrific. Unlike some apps yours is very intuitive and therefore only requires a few minutes to log in of my meals and snacks. I would offer a suggestion for one of your future updates. Is would be more user friendly if the recently used food list was presented to the user alphabetical to make it that much easier to find. Thanks again for such a great app..,
433,5,2019-06-04T19:46:27.000Z,MsvaNikki,Keto made easy!,This app has been amazing with the scan the product feature there is no guess work and mist all food I look for including restaurants are in there. I have lost 10 lbs to date and this is only day 6! Thank you so much to developers this is way better than other apps as it provides openings to different styles of keto and also will give you your macros based of your keto style and weight!

It's not just for keto, or low carb--you can select whatever your specific goals/macro needs are. I feel like it has more options for ounces/grams than MFP for those who weigh their food. My only criticism would be, I wish you could remove the 'keto grade' feature, as I am not keto and always feel a little judged when I log a food that gets a keto grade of F. 🤣",
435,3,2021-03-11T14:36:13.000Z,Jenn7098,Very helpful but a little buggy,"I downloaded this app a few days ago and so far it’s been extremely helpful, especially with meal planning.  But it has some bugs, such as miscounting my total carbs. The nutrition database is a fantastic resource as is the barcode scanner.  I may eventually pay for the premium version.",
436,1,2021-02-10T00:44:59.000Z,NoNameGiven66,Update makes it annoying and less functional,"New update is horrible. It takes too long to open app, takes too long to search for foods etc. New update is incredibly bad.",
437,4,2020-07-28T11:19:34.000Z,Dupp3d,Give it a try,"Honestly I think this is the best keto app out there. Not that it’s perfect but I’ve been scammed hard by other keto apps and this one is above board. You can tailor your macros, create and share recipes and scan bar codes, develop meal plans that sync to your daily food journal or use generic ones. The recipes are great too and I love that you can leave reviews for other users to see. A lot of times people post substitutions to recipes that they’ve tried. You could use this app for any diet, i think it’s better than MyFitnessPal.",

I was overwhelmed and did not how to start taking care of my self by changing my eating habits ! This app has been amazing in helping keep track of my carbs and calories. It has been so helpful to be able to add what I want to eat and truly see if it’s the best choice before I consume my meal. I love everything about it .

I have only used this app for a couple days but really like it a lot better than Cronometer app. I am committed to the Keto diet and have lost over 30 lbs (not a Puritan though...like my Coke Zero). After a month I will review it again in detail and then I will purchase the premium app and do another review. This review is mainly for customer support to see if their is a fix for this issue.,"Hello from Carb Manager support and thank you for your review.

440,5,2018-03-02T21:42:36.000Z,R-T-BOB,Carb Manager,"This is a great App for the Keto Zone diet. I plug in what I am going to eat and it breaks it down to show my macros instantly. This lets me adjust my meals as needed to maintain my macros to get to my goal. The only thing I have found that I don't like is say I make jalapeno poppers stuffed with cream cheese and wrapped in bacon, the gives you 40 kinds of poppers that you can purchase but doesn't allow for them being home made. But that is a small price to pay because I don't know what I would do without it.",
441,5,2018-06-08T15:15:57.000Z,Kyaecker,Very good app but... is it crippleware?,"Great for Keto if you spend $40 a year. Unfortunately the billing is all in one lump sum and not monthly. The other complaint I have is that periodically the app devs rollback features on non subscribers. What once was a feature you are used to using has been locked out until you pay. Almost sounds like a master marketing plan. It Gets you used to something that you can’t live without then bam pay up. Still a good app even though it is yes, crippleware","Hi Kyaecker, sorry about that. This problem has now been fixed. We'd love it if you could update your review when you get. Thanks!"

I love all the premium settings and would highly recommend this for anyone who manages their macro and micronutrients on a daily basis. The only reason I took away one star is because the app does not have an offline setting.

447,2,2021-01-08T16:19:07.000Z,Stratego Amigo,New update is garbage,"The new update was a radical redesign making it more difficult to navigate, less intuitive, and they’ve expanded all the elements so you can’t see your entire day in one screen anymore without scrolling up and down. If the you I needed some modernization they didn’t have to completely nuke the original user interface. I’m sure there are tens of thousands of people out there just like me hating the redesign. I really hope they walk some of this back in a new update, but considering how expensive it clearly was to do all of that redesign work there’s no way the decision-makers are going to do that.

448,3,2020-07-25T12:55:27.000Z,tepompom,Good app/confusing recipes,"I’ve done many food lifestyles over many years and have used a few apps. Carb manager is very good except the recipes are confusing. I made pancakes which had 10 teaspoons of oil listed in ingredients but instructions didn’t specify to add it to wet ingredients or use in pan for frying. Since the plan is very carb/calorie driven the ingredients/ amounts can make a difference in daily counting.  Also serving sizes for recipes are a little vague. Usually says one serving so you’d have to batch up the whole recipe to be accurate. Would be easier if it said 1 cup mashed cauliflower, etc. but recipes are good.","Hi, and thanks for the helpful feedback.

This makes it hard to log and a bit frustrating but everything else is great, I do wish they would let you export your projected weightloss to a larger chart so I can see estimated dates but that’s not really a compliant.

I only weigh at the doctors but knew by my clothes that I had gained weight.  I think tomorrow or Thursday is my 7th day and I know I’ve lost weight.

I’ve lost 15 pounds in the last 3 weeks because I can see what’s in my food - carb-wise and how it adds up each day. I’ve just started getting into some of the health tracking features that make it even better. I’m 55. I’ve dieted before without success. But I’m well on my way and on track to my ideal weight, lower blood pressure and lower cholesterol thanks to this app.",
520,4,2017-10-20T09:47:59.000Z,Astrohorse,Very slick app!,"I used to use the WW app, but then I hit menopause and the weight starting creeping up.  My doc recommended a low-carb diet, and this app is really helping me accomplish that.",
521,5,2017-11-01T23:21:12.000Z,Baxter Brown,Great little diet tool,"I'm only on my 2nd week of low carb dieting, but am planning to make this a lifestyle change instead of another yo-yo trip.  I have so much easily accessable information literally at my finger tips that good choices are easier to make now.  The daily food tracker seems to inspire me to stick with the plan.  I have used two recipes; both were delicious.   At age 67, I am long overdue in getting a handle on healthy eating...thanks to this App, I'm hopeful for success.",
522,5,2018-05-02T21:08:58.000Z,babiestdinosaur,Decided to try premium,"This is the most straightforward app I’ve found for beginning a low carb diet. Past apps I’ve used have focused too much on connecting with friends and became like social media, which felt less like challenging/supporting each other and more like a Diet Facebook. I also appreciate that the primary focus is NOT calories on this app. I’ve enjoyed using this so much that I just purchased a month of premium to get some meal plans.",
523,5,2018-07-06T23:12:33.000Z,sawiz0011,How do you connect to the iPhone health app,"So far so good but I’m having a few issues. I cannot seem to figure out how premium members can connect to the iPhone health app which, according to the exercise page, should be possible. Also, the carbs on my daily log aren’t adding up properly. (2+1=3, not 4 last time I checked.) Lastly, are the daily amounts/allowances of fat/protein supposed to change to accommodate large quantities of exercise? Please help!",
524,5,2018-09-11T15:26:48.000Z,adaenn,One small complaint,"I love this app! However, today I realized that the only entries for unsweetened, brewed black coffee in the app state 2g of fiber. I’ve never heard of fiber in coffee so I looked it up and despite some study in 2007 all the nutrition facts I could find report that coffee has 0g fiber. This has little to do with the app itself as much as the database it’s drawing from so I still give it five stars, just hoping someone will take note of the misleading info out there on coffee.",
525,5,2019-04-20T12:21:46.000Z,SeniorChief1991,Simply Awesomely Powerfully Flexibly Friendly,Found Carb Manager 3 weeks ago. Purchased 3 month subscription but wish I had subscribed for 12. I have followed Atkins style eating but tracking carbs was challenging. This app makes it easy and I have dropped 10 lbs eating Ketogenically. The ease of logging food and weight then viewing the data in an overlapping chart or graph is eye opening. I will enthusiastically subscribe for a year when my three months expire. Thanks.,

I bought premium because it was well worth the money, being able to create meals for quick adds (I eat the same meals all the time so it makes it very easy) is awesome. I also really love being able to plug a recipe in, input servings yield and having it calculate individual serving macros. That’s amazing.","We're delighted that you're loving the app, and are glad that you're finding it a useful resource! 😄"

This app has helped me get better control over my diabetes and my glucose numbers are more consistent and in range. I love that I can track my glucose and the amount of insulin I need. I use the information from the app to share with my pcp so he can help me with any issues I may be experiencing and make any necessary changes.,

The app is free but with the premium benefits for the year you get access so many more features including recipes that are phenomenal. We have made like 5 recipes and they are definitely going to be made regularly in this house. Definitely worth giving this app a shot.,
529,5,2019-10-16T03:45:35.000Z,Cavemonster,Great App,"I e just started the Keto diet and needed a way to track everything. This app was recommended by a friend and he was right. You just plug in your info and your off. You can log all your meals, snacks, supplements, etc and it calculates everything for you. Plus you can scan the barcode of whatever you’re about to consume and it pulls up all the data for that item and you can use that to plug into your meals. So convenient!",

Incredibly easy to use & comes loaded with tons of food selections. Best of all I can create my own meals & recipes. Love that you can import recipes from the web! This app has definitely helped me to continue to lose weight, get healthier and stay fit! I also love that It connects to my Fitbit Alta Hr!!! Give it a try. You’ll see what I say is true. It’s a life changer!!!",

532,5,2018-08-26T01:46:26.000Z,Martine's,I am Amazed!,I am so impressed with just how versatile this app is. I’m fairly new to Keto so I downloaded this app and was immediately overwhelmed. To my surprise it was actually very easy to get the basic stuff and the more time that I spent on it made everything else just fall into place. So don’t give up if you think you can’t use this app! It’s really just so easy and fun! I love planning my meals ahead of time so I know what groceries to buy and this lets me do it.,
533,5,2018-08-28T11:11:39.000Z,brittanyRM25,AWESOME APP and only one draw back so far,"This app is the most comprehensive, user-friendly nutrition tracker I have seen yet! I love it. The only drawback is if you have a fitness tracker you can’t link the two from your phone. You have to have a desktop. I unfortunately don’t own a personal computer and I cannot access the site at my job so I am stuck with this downfall. Regardless, my user-experience with this app is overally extremely positive!!!",
534,3,2019-04-12T01:03:31.000Z,DLGH812,Great app but has a lot of glitches,This is a very comprehensive app with great recipes and other features included.  I paid for the premium version but it won’t connect to my Fitbit which is a big let down considering that is why I paid for the premium version.  It does try to connect to Garmin and Apple Watch but has a glitch and doesn’t work for Fitbit.  It also won’t let me contact customer service via the app either.  It also freezes a lot which is frustrating.  It’s close but not quite there in my opinion.,
535,4,2019-04-23T01:32:17.000Z,JBRO66,Pretty Happpy,I bought the app within the last week and I’m fairly happy with everything except the accuracy of the food scanner.  I’ve seen quite a few items I’ve scanned that are errors or state “users have submitted error correction”.   Some of these have several users that have submitted changes but still pending. If I don’t have accurate info on the foods inputted how can I keep my diet as accurate as possible.    Otherwise I’d give this a 5 star rating (for now).   PLEASE UPDATE THE SUBMITTED CHANGES.,
536,5,2020-01-15T04:57:46.000Z,APeezaay,Keeps me accountable!,I’m not a person who likes make list or track things. I hate reading ingredients and numbers but wow this app made everything so easy! You can scan barcodes on packaged food or type in just a few letters and almost 95% of what you ate is already on their list. I also like the ability to sync your smart watch so it deducts your steps/exercise calories for the day. This app has helped me tremendously.,
537,4,2021-02-25T22:17:37.000Z,Keem293745638347,Updated rating after use,"I loved the previous version of this app, but, alas, it was updated. I was willing to give it a try before I complained too much. After a few weeks of using it, I still don’t like it. I find it very difficult to use after the ease of the previous one. You ask why I give it 4 stars? Because it does do what it’s intended to do. With lots of effort, I can keep up with my foods and my numbers. That’s really the most important thing, right?",
538,3,2021-02-17T05:06:23.000Z,notoriousnapper,One feature before Revamp was key,"Dictation was the one feature that made me love carb manager.

539,4,2021-01-10T13:52:08.000Z,outofstyle,Very helpful app,"As an older man who is struggling to adapt to a healthier lifestyle, I find this app very helpful. The ease of tracking my carbs, proteins, fats and calories (even water intake) make it easier for me to stay on-track. I’m not a person who enjoys weighing food or having to read every nutritional label, so the database of food and their pre-defined nutritional info makes my life easy.",
540,4,2017-10-28T15:01:16.000Z,Kborko535,Best Keto app for tracking food and macros,"I love this app! It’s great. No ads, no pop ups, really intuitive design and displays macros and goals clearly. I usually don’t like tracking my food and stuff in an app, but I really like this one. Only criticism would be in the food search/barcode scan, oftentimes the nutrition info automatically filled out is wrong. That can easily be edited, but it would be nice for it to be correct on the first try. Other than that, I love this app, and it’s really helped me so far in my Keto journey!!!",
541,5,2017-11-08T02:39:55.000Z,Paigiedee,Great App!!,"I initially had some issues after paying to go premium, but I contacted customer service and within 10 minutes they had me fixed and ready to go. I’ve tried several carb trackers, but I really like the layout on this one. It’s easy to navigate and copy meals to another date. Adding recipes is a breeze and it’s just really working for me so far. Thanks again to customer service for the prompt reply!!",
542,4,2018-02-26T00:22:11.000Z,Old Man Keto,Almost perfect,"It is made for tracking carbs, but it also tracks your macros if you are on a keto diet. It’s a little hard to use. A tutorial would be great. It tracks carbs and percentage, calories, fat grams and percentage, protein and percentage. Put in your exercise and it will deduct the calories from the days total. Plus there are a bunch of nutrients you can track as well. Overall it’s really good. But because of being a bit difficult to figure out I can’t give it five stars. But it’s worth the time.",

Nope.","Hi there, thanks for getting in touch about this. This was an error, and has now been fixed! Sorry for the interruption!"
545,5,2019-03-01T20:31:45.000Z,Parsonron,Winning!,I’ve struggled with my weight for years and have tried all the apps. Nothing worked until now! I’ve tracked every morsel for a month and am down 16 lbs. The scan feature is fantastic and I love seeing the visual grading of Low-carb foods on an A-F basis. Being able to preset goals and easily see daily progress is a huge plus. I recommend this app for anyone who is ready to be serious about a low carb diet. And this is all in the FREE version!,

There should be a report on one page for the whole month and week where you can see all calories, carbs , protein and your workout. This way you can keep track of the whole month that how many days you were on track and how many days you missed and you can do better.",
547,4,2019-09-26T21:39:32.000Z,Next stop 65,Does the job,"I had used another app years ago and this works a little better. It does pretty much what I need it to do, but grow weary with the ad to upgrade with almost every entry. Also would like a smoother process to enter a homemade recipe. An addendum with the standard grams of regular food-what you might have in the fridge-was available, I.e., anything that you can’t scan, would be nice. Overall, keeping me on track while I learn what is low or no carb. I would recommend it to anyone.",

And, it has a great library of foods to search from and track. Makes it easy to add just about anything I would eat. So far, the only thing I would like improved, is the way you track weight. It’s not difficult, but it’s just a lot of clicks to add a weight. Maybe if it was right on the front, on your daily tracking screen. Idk. Anyways, I like this app. And plan to keep using it!",

It has given me a better understanding and knowledge of keto. More so then any other app. There are so many delicious recipes to make and I can finally see what my goals are and how to achieve them. It is also very easy to maneuver through it and find what you need. I finally think I can do keto. Thank you for this app.,

I pay for my subscription and have for about three years.  I will be cancelling now.  This interface is abysmal.  Carb Manager developers, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!  You ruined a really good thing.  So damned frustrated/diet derailed.  I use this to track carbs for epilepsy, so I don’t have seizures.  You made this so much harder.",

I started crying because I couldn’t find the hundreds of recipes I’d created. Now in a recipe you can’t readily tell how many carbs each ingredient is after you create it. It would also be nice not to have to scroll until the end of your recipes just to create a new one.

I had no idea that with the new update, there was a macros deduction with calories burned, and I unknowingly went over my carb count causing me to get kicked off of my ketosis. To add more to my frustration, some of the net carb counts on items that you scan are so inaccurate. And there’s no user edits anymore! It looks like MyFitnessPal, and I left that app to use Carb Manager because I hated that layout. I hate that I wasted my money to use an app that feels like the one I ditched to begin with.",

On MFP you simply click often repeated items (like bullet proof coffee ingredients) and add them to the next day. Much more convenient and fast.

I’ve lost a lot of weight so far and I input this into the app. However, the macros and calories in the app do not change when I input my weight loss. As you lose weight your macros and your calorie amount should change alongside it so you can have an accurate amount of what to eat up to in order to continuously lose weight. Please include this on the next update 😊 thank you.",

It’s helped me keep on track by sending me helpful reminders to log every meal. I also love the weight tracker and seeing my progress in a graph.

Take the Chicken ceasar salad from the restaurant NEWKS. There are 2 sizes of the salad, even without croutons the carb and calorie counts are all over the place for what is the same salad in its description. CarbMaster customers would be better served if the App curated items from established restaurants, also keeping in mind that people needing carb master won’t have croutons on their salads anyway so why are salads with croutons even a option?",

Also, it would be nice if you could type in a product and the app would recommend a good Keto substitute. For instance, if I type in Ketchup it could recommend 3 or more types of keto substitutes.

It’s ok, and I like a lot of the features, but I’m finding it doesn’t read barcodes correctly which is a HUGE problem.   At first I thought maybe it was an issue with the barcodes, but then cross referenced with the other app which read them fine.

It doesn’t grab the calories burned. I have to manually click edit and then manually add the calories burned which is a pain. Now, it’s not even saving my manual inputs no matter what day. Also, shouldn’t your app allow users to earn macros after we’ve logged an exercise? in other words - give us a few more net carbs, protein, & fat, to consume.",

However, once accomplished it makes succeeding in the ketogenic diet much, much easier.

629,4,2019-08-12T17:34:02.000Z,Bluflcn,Free version is great!,"The app itself is great. Imputing your foods and seeing the 3 big macros is a breeze. I was a bit skeptical when the wife wanted to go Keto, without this app I’d probably blown it already. The exercise portion is very limited to some very basic exercises, and it’s short on those too. Searching for foods to input finding the food and being unable to add that recipe without going premium is also pretty lame, but not a deal breaker. Overall really great user friendly app!",
630,5,2018-08-26T03:28:53.000Z,Dreamertera,Makes Keto simple,My husband and I are so happy to have found this app. It is very simple to use and makes keeping track of progress so much easier. Do the Keto diet and limiting our carbs to only 25 max a day does not give you much room for error. I downloaded this on our third week and it has made a huge difference already and it’s simplicity has made it a good motivator for staying on track.,
631,5,2019-01-12T02:35:09.000Z,FroMamma,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I follow a keto diet and track macros.  I seriously don’t know what I’d do without this app.  I love the ability to scan items, search tons of food items, restaurant items, build your own recipes, and keep a list of favorites.  You can customize what you track and you get a nice visual chart in addition to a list to see where you’re at daily.  You can even go back and edit previous days.  Great app.",

Now that I am no longer doing that, I am still able to use this app to meet my health goals. You can change the settings to make it whatever you need it to be. I looked at many of the other free apps, and I found that this one has the most to offer.",
633,5,2019-07-02T18:56:00.000Z,Shalani777,Very Helpful,"I have been using this app with the paid subscription for a few days and it is very helpful. It’s great to be able to see how many grams of protein, carbs, and fats I am eating per meal and also for the whole day. It breaks everything down nicely and is easy to understand with their graphs. Being able to calculate calories and how many calories I am burning is also really helpful. I love this app!",
634,5,2020-09-07T08:26:37.000Z,Lauriannaah,Overall great aid!,I really do love this app. I have taught fitness and am a nurse and I appreciate all the info available here. I love the recipes as well. My only complaint is there is no option for me to personalize for my schedule. I work nights and wake at 1600 every day. What I call my lunch is at about 0200 and dinner in the morning when I get home. Would be an AMAZING thing to have an app able to adapt to alternative schedules...,

I want to love it like I use to but just keep finding myself frustrated and wanting to not login. It use to keep frequently used foods right at the top of the list now they are gone everyday gotta type in all the sane products. I haven’t even been able to find the premium recipes! Really not happy with the changes. Can’t give up on it cause I paid for the year :-(,
637,5,2020-06-05T13:51:17.000Z,ceh259,Awesome App,Been using this app for about a week. Was very skeptical. I love my new app. I am an older person who was told by my doctor to cut the carbs way back for health issues. The app is easy to use and it was a real “eye opener” as to the amount of carbs I was consuming. I especially love the scan feature. It saves me a lot of time searching for my off brand items. Kudos for making this app. Highly satisfied.,
638,5,2021-01-24T01:56:04.000Z,Torymosaa,Always Crashing,This app is amazing but needs a couple fixes. Ever since I bought the premium it’s been crashing EVERY DAY and when I create a recipe and look for it in “My Recipes” sometimes I can’t find it which is frustrating. If they would fix those 2 issues I’d definitely give it 5 stars because overall it’s really goid at helping you track your Macros.,"Hi there, thanks for the review and feedback! Many of the crashing issues have been resolved with recent updates, so please make sure you're updated to the most recent version of v7 via the app store. If you're still experiencing and specific issues you can reach out in-app via Settings → Help & Support, with your issues + app store username and our Support team can troubleshoot for you. Cheers!"
639,1,2021-02-13T18:55:24.000Z,Cantseecards,"They broke it, look for an alternative","I have faithfully tracked my foods daily for the 20 months I’ve been on keto and have credited the premium subscription version of Carb Manager for being able to do so easily. With this new update, however, they have royally screwed up a great product (think New Coke). It is unusable. It is slow, you literally can’t read text because gray text is on colored boxes that obscure it, foods have disappeared and the charts are useless. Unless they put back the original, look elsewhere. That’s what I’m on the App Store for now. It’s not worth it to use the free version, much less a premium subscription.",
640,5,2018-01-31T16:44:49.000Z,mandi1171,I heart my Carb Manager,"This is the first app I have used that actually works the way it’s supposed to.  I had gone through different programs wanting to keep up with Net Carbs and my Protein.  I’d even paid for premium services but none did what Carb Manager does.  The scan was hit or miss with other apps like Livestrong or Atkins and I was always having to manually enter the information but not with Carb Manager.  Great job, great app!",
641,4,2018-12-08T14:18:11.000Z,BomberNav,Very good app. A few notes,"I have enjoyed the app. The food logging is relatively easy and there are lots of foods available by scan or from the database. I wish the interface was a little better. Some features are difficult to find the first time. Also, I wish there was a way to share food items that one use has logged with another user so that my wife and I don’t have to dual enter everything (recipes, custom foods, etc.)","Hey there, thanks for the review! To answer your question: you can share food items with another member by going to Community > Friends and adding that member as a friend. Then, you'll be able to view their custom foods, recipes, meals, etc., and vice versa. Hope this helps 😃!"

The past few days it stopped working. It won’t let me add any food. I’ve tried deleting it and reinstalling it several times. It also doesn’t work on my iPad but it does on my pc.

I’m able to scan products that I buy and eat frequently, so that I may easily add them to a meal period during the day. It’s got a large “library” of grocery and restaurant items, which help you keep up with your micros, total carbs and calories on the go. It also has some wonderful recipes. And this is the free version!!",
646,5,2020-05-19T00:15:42.000Z,BostonGuy99,REALLY excellent app,"This app is incredibly easy to use, comprehensive content and an exceptional user interface. I’ve tried other weight related apps and have failed to follow through because the app was stubborn, clunky or just really hard to use. Carb Manager is well thought out and the Pro level has ease of use features that make it a cinch to stay on track. Kudos to the dev team.",
647,4,2020-09-02T07:06:31.000Z,Unsure about UnSync,Time to make human centered design,"Wombat Apps: you’re nearly a top 20 fitness app because of solid content and an all-in-one approach. However, it’s not because of design. When all these apps start to provide the same thing (copy you), users will switch to whatever has the most friction free experience for something they need to use multiple times daily. Highly recommend hiring a pro UX designer who does only front end—not full stack.",

The dashboard is less intuitive and harder to see.  I can’t find how to add a food, and I don’t think I can see other user’s contributions.

That’s when I found Carb Manager. It took less than 2 minutes to figure out how to use it and I’ve been going strong ever since.

This app is easy to use and it tracks my carb intake. But there are little things that are annoying: Like trying to find food that I eat frequently. Some appear in the list and some don’t. Regardless of which filter I use. So I mark all as Favorites- nope. I scroll down the list and all it does is redundantly all the exact same favorites, over and over.

Net calories are no longer being tracked even though I’ve gone into settings 100 times and verified everything, e.g. If you feel like your blood pressure isn’t high enough and you don’t have enough frustration in your life, I highly recommend a download. Also good luck with tech support it doesn’t exist. Awful.","Hi there - Thanks for letting us know about the issue.

The new app experience is confusing and definitely not user friendly. I could deal with that but it’s also messed around with some of my settings and even some of the foods that I had created. I’ve wasted so much since I updated yesterday just trying to get this back to where I can use it and I’m really irritated. I’m a Premium member and I loved the ease of Carb Manager before and I’ve tracked religiously but unless I can get the old app back, I think I’m going to be looking for a new app.","Hi! We hear you on the frustration of getting used to a new app, and know this is a big adjustment. Some changes are expected, others may be a glitch that our developers can fix.

They’re not always the most consistent since you rely on other users a lot but overall close to real macros. I did premium for a year, not really worth it IMO. I mainly just use the app for logging intake, watching macros, and reviewing weight trends though. I like that I can save my go to meals and recipes!",
658,5,2020-01-23T02:59:03.000Z,caitycurlyq,5 stars!,"I gave this app a 5 star rating because it checks so many boxes for me!

683,3,2021-07-15T18:09:20.000Z,GaelicDragons,Premium is disappointing,"The free version is super useful for tracking any kind of diet. I decided to try premium mostly for the meal planning. However the available meal options are extremely limited and most aren’t even that highly reviewed. Also if you choose to let carb manager auto add some items to meet your macro goals (I needed more carbs) it adds beer, wine, and sugar. Like straight up table sugar. What the heck! I thought this was supposed to be a health app. How about some fruit or starches instead?","Hi there, thanks for taking the time to share your constructive feedback! Our Development Team is in the process of fine tuning this feature.

684,3,2021-02-19T15:18:06.000Z,drbothun,Good and ok,"I’ve tried several keto apps.  Carb Manager has many details that are handy.  However, recipes are limited and search option is just ok.  Keto Cycle has much better recipe choices.  But the app lacks the details, like percentages.  Eat This Much has decent recipes, meal planner and grocery lists that are nice and easy.  Search function is easy to use.  But there are no percentages.  Bottom line, I’m using 3 apps right now, each one having good and not so useful actions.  Still shopping for a “complete” keto app.",
685,5,2020-03-09T18:30:31.000Z,Clans hero,Best Diet App yet,"Takes a little time to learn how to use but so worth it. Can choose the type of diet / daily macros , can even change that throughout the day as long as you stay under the calories needed to lose weight you want. Goes to show it REALLY is all about calories consumed vs calories burned at the end of the day. And it tells you exactly how many to eat to meet your goal.",

When i see actual calories, i begin to panic that I’ve eaten too much, however, when i set a macro limit as per my lifestyle, i can focus on macros and as long as i stay within my goals, calories do not matter.

I also like the list of foods that pop up, although it would be great if there were a way to add to the list.  One fix it really could use is a way to send a report about incorrect nutritional info for scanned or listed foods.  Or else a way to enter the correct info by hand.",

However, I find it very frustrating that it insists on calculating my calories and macros for me and won’t allow me to manually input them. I can manually input the calories and it will calculate the macros or vice versa, but it won’t let me enter both. There’s also no way to manually enter my own recipes. I create them on MFP and then just enter the macros on this app. Would be great if I could do everything in one app.","Hey there — to input macros and calories manually, please go to Foods > Quick Entry. There, you can enter custom macros for a meal. To create a recipe, please go to Foods > My Foods > Recipes and add one there.

The scan option (for food labels) is my favorite thing to use on here and the recipes look amazing!!! Just started tracking my blood pressure as well as blood glucose and ketones. I stopped using this app 2 yrs ago and really regret it. This definitely keeps me on track and holds me accountable.,
696,2,2021-02-19T01:04:18.000Z,CAthena17,Latest update killed it,"This app used to be pretty easy to use for tracking calories and macros at a glance. Now they’ve changed it so calories are the smallest inner circle of the display, and that makes it REALLY easy to misread. The old display was so much better and I don’t understand why they changed it for something uglier and harder to use. There are definitely gonna be people who want to lose weight who find themselves stalled out or gaining because the most important part for building or losing mass is now impossible to read.",
697,2,2021-02-10T14:56:50.000Z,Sunnyflorida,Why fix what wasn’t broken?,Before the latest update this app was excellent. The current update is full of bugs. It takes me at least two times to load - it continuously tells me I am offline when I am not. The progress circle (next to pie chart) is completely broken and just sits there looking empty all day.  Custom recipes do not always appear when I want to add them. They do eventually but sometimes are not there. I recommended this app to several friends and am embarrassed at how clunky it has become.,

I like to choose the meal plan option that will tell me what to eat during the week but tbh I don’t always like the choices given for my meal prep. So I wish there was an option for when i don’t like a certain meal, I can swap it for another suggestion but the app doesn’t allow that so I’m at a loss when it comes to make Hong something to eat","Hi and thanks for your review.

It would be so much better if I could print recipes directly from the app. There’s an option to do so, but it doesn’t print correctly. Can you fix this? Another thing that would be helpful is if the recipes could specify serving size, ie. this recipe makes 6 servings of 1 cup each. Instead, the recipes only say how many servings total.",

But it is not a free app. It’s not as easy to learn how and what all the settings are on the app. It’s my first one that is just a low carb app. Other apps I have used seems more user friendly and allows you to customize a lot more of your goals. You only get to use the app 12 times in one day and that’s why it’s only 3 stars.",

Other than that small issue the app is great at keeping track of macros and the UI is very easy to operate. One of the best features is being able to copy the link from recipe and it load all the info from the website.,

When I deleted it they had no other option for breakfast for me. I guess I was supposed to go without.  Then for a snack the gave me a bacon wrapped pickle.

Searching for better app currently; very disappointing as this was a huge help in my weight loss journey.,"Hi there - thanks for contacting us.

Flaw #1 when entering your macros there is a bug that will set the number of calories to 358. If you try to change this number it crashes unless you add a 1 in front to make it 1358 then edit. Flaw #2 manually entering recipes is a PIA. I love the upload button for websites but I haven’t found that you can edit what you actually put in the meal/substituting.,

Adding carbs when the value of the actual product says zero carbs, adding calories, etc. Pay attention! It may look right at first, but double check.

I’ve done side by side comparison with the other tracker and I do see variances but not enough to feel like this app is inaccurate. I do occasionally have difficulty scanning or locating food in the database. Overall I think it’s really helping me understand the effect of what I’m eating and helping me be successful on keto. Started on Saturday and weighed today and have seen some weight loss and have not been hungry at all!,

I was disappointed in the lack of branded items in the database, such as Sodexo, a major food service company. However, CM has expanded their database, and even lets you know when it is a user-defined option or an officially branded option. Excellent upgrade that sets CM above the competition.","Hi there, thanks for contacting us! We have lots of items from the Sodexo and thousands of other brands.

I would like to add customized measurement categories and not be limited to those set by Carb Manager. Example — I want to measure both right and left bicep, thigh, and calf. I also want to measure my lower belly. (Even the FREE version of MFP has this basic functionality- I would expect that something I am paying a premium for would too.)",

This is extremely inconvenient and I don’t see the reason for that - it is really poor software  design.

There is no way I could keep track of my macros without it. I don’t like that it only allows you to enter whole numbers the weights. If I have lost 1/2 a pound I want that to be reflected on the graph. Maybe this is a function only if you pay and again I think that would be silly. Other than that. Great app,

I wanted to add a Jack in the box cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce/ no bun but couldn’t find that option so instead added the one from Wendy’s; sure it’s all the same at the end of the day but being a Keto app and knowing people will be modifying their food the ability to add a standard item and then remove the carb items should be a standard feature... please add this for the community - seems like a no brainer.,

For that reason I’m still using MPF more. Carb Manager seems to have more foods in their list and I like how it calculates Net Carbs.

But using the app daily is the key.  And therein lies the rub for my past yoyo successes and failures.  I lost the weight and think I can go back to poor eating habits without consequence.

However, I started noticing it miscalculates the macros in certain foods, particularly the NET CARBS. I've experienced this when entering whole foods AND even when using the barcode scanner. For example, the La Mission low carb wraps list 3 net carbs per wrap on their packaging, but when inputting the wrap via the barcode scanner, this app says it has 4 net carbs. According to Perfect Keto, 1 cup of cabbage has 3 net carbs, but the app calculates 5. I don't feel I can rely on this to help me keep track of what I'm eating. Hoping they fix this!!","Thanks for sharing your experience and feedback. We pride ourselves on the accuracy of our food database.

Used to be able to create recipes, add custom foods without issue; this newer version is often buggy when it comes to doing those tasks and I become frustrated. My vote would be to go back to their other version from a few months ago! Never an issue. I continue to use it because the database is extensive & fairly trustworthy.",

811,5,2019-01-26T00:17:11.000Z,Kandioliv323,Exactly what I needed.,This app makes tracking your intake so easy. My favorite benefit is being able to scan barcodes at the grocery store and knowing before buying whether the item is keto or not. It also gives you a grade for that specific item which informs you about how it’s keto and how often/how much you should have of it. I love it!,

I like that includes exercise, bodyweight, and has a large food inventory to choose from. I love the scanning feature as well. I think the monthly/yearly prices are quite steep. I paid the one-time fee of $10 to have unlimited logging of my food. However, that didn’t give me access to any of the other features. Disappointing. Overall, it’s a good app. The pricing seems to be a bit out of whack.",

The upgrade also doesn’t pull the most common entries anymore and lists stuff I haven’t used in weeks or months verses stuff I entered in the last few days. It’s harder to add your updated weight as well. I hate the new version.

The interface is reminiscent of the useless Google fit. The dark and grayed out fonts in the macros are hard on the eyes. My everyday items are not working properly (unable to edit). Finally and most importantly, the app does not export calories to Apple Health app consistently or logically. I hope that you turn this around or I will have no choice but to cancel my subscription and go elsewhere.",

Plus the navigation is funky not nearly as smooth as the other app. Can’t say I’ll be using this app. I don’t want to manually import recipes and I’m not paying $9 for premium.",

It is also very sensitive to touch, which can cause some entries to change unintentionally.  They also took away the decimal feature which I loved using on the previous version.  Bottom line: I DON’T LIKE IT!!  Oh, they also switched colors around - Red used to represent Fats, now it represents Carbs; and Yellow now represents Fats; no more Green.",

I used it for a long time and then they “updated” it. Epic failure! I have not talked to one single person that likes the updated version!! It’s harder to use and find things and found that not all foods are listed correctly anymore. I even upgraded my membership hoping that might make it better but nope. I wish there was a way to opt back in to the older version. Very disappointed!,

It has helped me understand all that I was doing wrong to get/stay into ketosis. That furnace that everyone is talking about.... I feel it. As I am writing this - I am feeling it. Great app - you just have to be honest about what you eat and you will be ok. Try it.,

It constantly crashes or has to reload. I also don’t like that it tells you what you have eaten in bold and not what you have left. It also doesn’t care much about calories. The design layout for counting just seems backwards and not very intuitive. I also doesn’t like to count my streaks and constantly resets it.,

It is very hard to find items. Your favorites don’t come up. Recipes are missing. There’s a glitch when you want to change your daily items amounts and it won’t let you change them. There needs to be a lot of changes made to get the app back to the valuable tool that it used to be. If the app does not improve by the time my renewal is due in May I will not renew.,

Since the macros are so important it is helpful to have this handy app keep track of that. Especially one that calculates the net carbs. Super easy to use it is keeping me on track so far in this early stage of my journey. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is switching to a keto diet and lifestyle.,

I get it that the entire datebase cannot be downloaded to your phone however common meals and favorites should.  Before this I was using lose it which does have a decent amount of food that you can access offline but it did have net carbs which is why I switched .,

My only complaint and reason for kit higher stars is because when entering food, it has the option for popular fast food options but not bunless options. If I go to McDonald’s and get a McDouble it shows the McDouble but not “no bun@ option. This is the same for lots of foods and restaurants. I think this needs an update with this information.",

Seriously,  every time I open the app and at least every other time I change a page ""upgrade to premium"" page pops up.  Supremely annoying.  Makes me not want to give money to the people who subject me to this - even though the premium features seem useful.  A little space to breathe would go a long way developers.","We're sorry to hear that the pop-up reminder to upgrade to Premium has created some annoyance for you in the app. This reminder should only appear 1x a day or any time you tap on a feature that is only accessible to Premium subscribers. We're thrilled to offer the free app to as many people as possible. However, we do rely on paid subscriptions to assist us in this goal."

I remembered it was really helpful in monitoring my macros and it was easy to use. However, this time I even paid for premium and the app continues to crash every time I open it. I have closed and reopened app, restarted my phone, uninstalled/reinstalled, and updated iOS 14.6 and nothing is fixing the issue.","Hi there, and thanks for leaving us constructive feedback!

But since the new update EVERYTHING has become harder. Just adding to a meal is complicated! When I scan a barcode it always scans and then just comes up blank, which makes me have to scan it again! It takes me 2-4 tries before it actually pulls anything up! Honestly I just wish I could somehow revert back to the old layout!",

Ive enjoyed this app for I had lost 100 pounds and am now in the best shape of my life thanks to carb manager, no doubt. But ever since carb manager dev team updated it, it’s just not the same anymore. To confusing. Not user friendly. Prior to the update, the interface was very easy to maneuver through. Until they have a option to use the older interface, I’m going to delete this, cancel my premium, and look else where.",
1007,2,2021-01-24T17:49:28.000Z,Seattlelizzy,New UI is pretty but glitchy and slow,"I upgraded to the new user interface a couple of days ago. Everything takes much longer to enter in the new app due to slow loading times, especially with search. In addition it is harder to add foods to “my foods”, And the three dots in the right hand corner of any particular food item screen where a menu should come up, isn’t pulling the menu up for me. I wish I could go back to the old version.","Hey there, sorry to hear you're experiencing challenges with the new app. We're currently working on a big fix to our search engine functionality, which will speed things up in that area. In the meantime, feel free to reach out to support in-app via Settings → Help & Support for assistance with the ""my foods"" menu issue you referenced."

1022,3,2018-03-04T12:48:12.000Z,Heather2938,Better than most,I love the way macros and other info is displayed - this app is terrific for keto. However entering a complete recipe is very tedious and time consuming compared to some other nutrition apps. I also don’t like that the app doesn’t work when there is no data or WiFi available. I think a few simple changes could make this the hands down best app. I hope the developers continue to make improvements.,

1026,1,2021-03-23T00:53:20.000Z,fracturedphoenix,Disappointing,Every feature worth using on this app costs a premium subscription. Not even a free trial to see if it would be worth the cost of the subscription. I mean seriously... what if I don’t care for your idea of a meal plan? Or the recipes I find are just too out there for my taste? And I opt not to continue using this app? Then I’ve paid for something I’m not using. It’s a waste of money without allowing me limited time trial access to see if what’s available is worth it to me to actually pay to continue receiving the content.,
1027,1,2021-02-15T03:46:51.000Z,Missjacks,Good app but food database is lacking,"Unlike fitness pal this app does NOT have a lot in their food database. I’m finding myself needing to manually add items of food that I consume even when scanning the UPC barcode of the food items. Plus some of the macros of the selections they have are off. For example, they have sea scallops as 5 grams of carbs?! They should be at least 1 or even 0 grams. The development team needs to improve this feature. Oh and the new update is awful.

You have pizza and french fries on here that show zero net carbs... Now MOST people know that's not right..  But you know there's people out there eating the crap out of some fries sayin ""but it's keto according to my tracker!"". Wish they would use only verified nutrition info.",

I make a meal list and generate something but I cannot find it add a shopping list. I tried to find the macros on something in the store and could not find the scanner feature     It seems like a lot of the features are hidden   I have spent about 2 hours on this app and still I. The same place I was before I water my money.,"Hey there, sorry you weren't happy with the app -- we appreciate the feedback. Meal plans you generate can be found under Foods > My Foods > Meal Plans.

When you can finally edit the calories it switches back to the old count the next day. I also found a lot of the foods net carbs are wrong. Even from past foods I scanned.

I wish it was all molded for macro numbers in stead of having one bolder and the other not or something. I struggle enough that I’m considering switching apps. It’s so hard to read the weight loss too with having to run and find my glasses which I only usually use while sitting at the computer. Please fix this.,

If you can find it the carbs and calories are completely wrong when you compare it to nutrition sites. Nearly double the calories in many cases. If you still decide to use this app knits know it isn’t accurate, so double check on sites such as nutritionix or other sites. Don’t even think about a simple search such as “boiled Potatoes” as it will return meatloaf and mashed potatoes and all sorts of unrelated foods!",

The upgrade has ruined it for me as well as for most of the longtime customers. I decided not to renew and made a decision to go back to the LoseIt app since they have made tremendous improvements on carb tracking, macro management, as well as a bunch of great new features.

1354,3,2020-02-02T02:30:41.000Z,Rhythmnc,Too soon to tell?,"I would love to give this 5 stars but I find the shopping list feature frustrating, mostly because the recipe to meal planning to shopping list generation workflow aren’t as eloquent as I would like.","Hey there, and thanks for sharing your experience. We'd love to dive a little deeper and share how to make the best use of our Meals Plans and Shopping Lists! Just reach out in-app, and we can share how. We're also happy to announce we're in the process of revamping these features now, and you should expect to see this new and improved very soon. Thanks again!"
1355,5,2020-01-10T13:29:37.000Z,Seedyneenee,Just What I Need!,Love this app.  I want to simply keep track of carbs - I don’t need all the extras most apps have.  With this app I can customize it to suit my needs.  It has a ‘diabetic carbs’ option which is perfect.,
1356,5,2020-01-06T02:18:30.000Z,TMadero,Great app,"This app is simple to use and has every food that exists in the program for simple macro counts. Even generics, store brands, and store deli meats come up in the search. I am technologically challenged and can navigate this app easily. I enjoy the confetti after logging in my macros for a job well done!",
1357,5,2020-01-05T19:24:46.000Z,MegaMiah,Very easy to use!,"This app is fantastic. It’s easy to add foods, edit, copy, or move meals if need be. Also the scan feature is fantastic! It’s so easy to add ingredients. There are user recipes and they are listed right there in the app! This app has been VITAL to my success and tracking carb, fat, and protein intake.",

I also love the access to the menus and they many are not complex or time consuming.  I will provide another update in 3 months.,
1360,3,2018-06-12T03:41:59.000Z,BonnieJHG,Works well,"I’ve been using the app for a week. It’s relatively intuitive to use and the database seems very robust. The reason I only gave three stars is that a very large portion of the features require a premium membership, whereas other trackers I’ve used, such as MyFitnessPal, include those features for free. I’d rather see a couple of ads and be able to link my Fitbit and see my micronutrients.",
1361,5,2018-08-01T17:52:51.000Z,SecretSparrow5,All you need in one place,Excellent app... allows you to scan barcode and gets the nutrition info.. all you need to do is in mention the amount you consumed. Also... has inbuilt diet plans with detailed recipes for lunch breakfast dinner and snacks... best feature is you can link it with fitbit,
1362,5,2018-08-06T20:00:13.000Z,Julesrn33,Great app for counting carbs!!,I’m new to counting carbs and was hesitant to use an app thinking it would be cumbersome. A little time up front with some of my fave recipes and it’s so easy!! You will be surprised where all the hidden carbs are and how fast they creep up. The scanner works great too! I’m very happy with this app.,
1363,5,2018-08-16T21:15:40.000Z,Jaxanixa,Excellent Tool,"This app is a must if you are doing a Keto lifestyle change. It has the best tracking system I’ve found, along with a great visual graphic pie to show your daily Macros. I would love the ability to add yesterday’s meal with one swipe, but other than that, it really helpful app.",

I’m sure there are other users who like to keep past months but I want the option not to.  Customer Service at Carb Manager tells me it can’t be done.  Other than that the program is okay.,
1366,5,2019-01-08T13:18:51.000Z,Mymacros,Incredible,"I really like this app. It has helped me to keep track of my macros and calories. One of the main things that I like is that it has a diverse list of products including meets, produce and vegetable. Also, I’m able to write and record voice notes.",
1367,1,2019-01-31T17:16:02.000Z,Zenchez1,Refund requested. Not worth it,I got this for a month and had issues all month. Database is incorrect on many foods macros and not having them on file. Server issues several days this month. Also i find that the computation for macros is inaccurate. Im unable to override the calories or macros to what I know should be accurate for myself. I got my refund and am returning to “my fitness pal”. The only upside to CM features was it allows us to track net carbs vs total.  Its not worth the hassle of everything else.,
1368,5,2019-02-22T19:59:43.000Z,WyoBlondie,Very easy to use,I do not like “recording “ food intake even knowing this is the best way to track calories and carbs.  This app makes it easy and has a wide variety of options to choose from I have been using it for a week and love it so far,
1369,1,2019-04-16T14:44:52.000Z,Berg14,Foods Won’t Upload,I just downloaded this app and I was so excited because it has features that a previous app I used didn’t have. However I need help because none of the recipes or food I’m trying to download is working. It keeps saying “Network Error.” I’ve tried to use the app using WiFi as well as cellular data. I’ve looked at help articles on the website and all. Can someone help me because I really want this app but I’m not going to pay for features I can’t use.,
1370,5,2018-05-16T19:21:17.000Z,Branreview,Big help,As a beginner this app has been my go to for figuring out what I am doing.  I like that I can at a glance see how my macros are.  It’s easy to use the food adding part.  They offer your choices in many amounts unlike other apps I tried.  I highly recommend this app!,
1371,5,2018-06-10T11:01:09.000Z,Crappy ol app,Good app,My Only issue is the load time sometimes it takes forever to load or I’ll have to open it close it then reopen it before it will actually load. The app has certainly helped me lose weight and stay committed to my diet.,
1372,5,2021-05-24T18:28:48.000Z,cory_k,Good but needs a few things,App is good ! Some food items have wrong  macros but you can’t expect 100% from the app and also I would like to see dark theme mode added please the white is hard to look at at night times,

We read the reviews on Carb Manager and decided to purchase the premium package! Look no more, this is it. It has anything and everything you’ll need to succeed, thank you guys",
1374,2,2021-04-15T22:22:02.000Z,i dont like your ads,App isn’t fully functional,"I paid for premium and the app is super glitchy. Premium things you pay for such as meal planning time out and you can’t save your progress. I contacted developers twice and they’re response was to use the web version, it’s their busy season (?). I paid for the app not to use your website. If anything your app should be more functional for me than free users. Just my opinion.","Hi, and thanks for taking the time to leave us a review! Since you posted it, many fixes and improvements have been implemented by our Development Team.

1376,1,2021-01-10T06:36:53.000Z,Meepersmonkey,Horrible update,"I’ve been using this app as a premium user for a long time and previously loved it. There are sooo many issues with this latest update. Recipes that I created over the years are gone. Many foods that I saved are gone. You can no longer add foods from a recipe individually. So many more issues. Come on developer, this was not ready for prime time. I’ve invested so much time in this app until now so I’m hopeful that you push an update to fix all this stuff soon.","Hi Meepersmonkey! Thanks so much for that feedback and for your support as a Premium member. What you're seeing isn't typical for the app update, and we'd love the opportunity to get this resolved for you. Rest assured that all of your recipes and saved foods can be restored. Please reach out to our friendly support team in the app via Settings → Help & Support, and be sure to reference your app store user name. We look forward to hearing from you!"
1377,5,2020-12-06T03:46:45.000Z,Julie Buuuuulie,Takes the guessing away.,This app just makes eating a low carb diet of any sort much easier. Being able to see how much fat I’m eating as well as protein makes it so I can easily achieve my goals with getting healthier and losing this quarantine jiggle!,
1378,3,2020-10-06T15:34:19.000Z,RedhouseClan,Mass “copy” would be nice,"When copying meals of the day from one day to another, you can only do one at a time. It’d be nice to be able to just transfer a whole days meal plan to multiple days. Also, when you do copy, it takes you to the day you copied over to. I don’t want to do this. Since I can’t mass copy, I have to go back and find that day again.","Hi there, and thanks for the review and suggestion!

I downloaded this app then began the set up process until I reached a dead end demanding I purchase their service.,"Hey there! Thanks for your feedback. Our core app is free and always will be. In fact, we don't offer a trial of our Premium, because we always let our users choose for themselves. Many of our users reach their goals without ever upgrading to Premium. Our Premium version is there for users who want access to advanced features like fitness device integrations, premium recipes, and more, but both versions find success stories!"
1380,5,2019-05-30T16:40:04.000Z,cmiller1113,So helpful,Sometimes there are hidden carbs in things I thought were low carb. I love being able to put a recipe in to confirm it is actually low carb and the scanner is really helpful at the store so I don’t have to spend too much time reading labels.,

The databases are vast and if it what you are looking for isn’t there you can add it!  Customer Service is awesome!!!  I’d give this app 10 stars if I could!!,
1382,5,2020-08-13T00:27:35.000Z,Kimmima,What’s not to love,I can’t say enough about this app. I have the premium version and it is worth every penny. It tracks everything and makes it super easy to know where adjustments should and could be made. It’s super motivating and very user friendly.,

1385,4,2020-07-25T22:59:43.000Z,Grandma of Declan,Major reason I have stayed on keto,This app has been a lifesaver for me! It has been 32 years since I have lost any weight although I’ve desperately needed to do so the entire time. Lost 10 pounds in first month! This app makes everything so unbelievably simple and that is a huge timesaver which translates to ease of staying on keto.,
1386,5,2020-03-29T00:57:49.000Z,ereina,Great app for Gestational Diabetes,Great app to track carbs. You can even change to track “diabetes carbs”. I tried for a week and then upgraded to Premium so I could track my Glucose Meter readings (Blood Sugar Levels). This will help me identify which foods are making my blood spike. So critical for the safety of my baby.,

It figures you macros, tracks your daily intake, provides wonderful step by step with pictures recipes and generates daily, weekly, or monthly reports. As your weight goes down it automatically generates new macro amounts.  I’m so impressed.",
1390,3,2018-03-12T16:23:31.000Z,Rettab84,Microphone,I want to understand this a little better. Why would I want to do certain things the screen for to buy premium comes on. Why is it you cannot use the microphone to say what you were eating? And I don’t have time or the patience to measure everything out exactly so a lot of the stuff makes it hard to add food. Just as bad as doing weight watchers,

The only problem is we can eat the same exact thing (food type, amount, etc) and the macros on her app would be different than mine. For some reason mine is more on par with the nutrition labels and hers is off. If it wasn’t for that then this app would be perfect.",

I don’t need any of the other features premium offers but connection to a device.  I’d pay a one time fee for that but not a large monthly fee.  That is the only reason I’m going with the Atkins app, which is not as nice in my opinion but works with my Fitbit for free. ☹️",

I eventually purchased the app so I can have access to the unlimited amount of keto recipes to help with my success. I’m noticing that the recipes are not all low carb. And the recipes that have bread in them don’t give the recipe for the bread, so is that really a low-carb recipe?  I’m so confused.","Hey there, thanks for getting in touch. To narrow the recipe search to very low carb items, please tap the ""More"" button and use the carb slider to only search for recipes below a certain threshold of carbs. Hope this helps!"

I tried for over an hour yesterday to input a custom recipe and the app wouldn’t allow me to add ingredients. Furthermore the layout, while looking nicer, is no longer concise.

Items keep popping up that I have not used in a long time, as well as repeated items, and, being that there is a limit of items that show up, I have to look the product up all over again. It’s a waste of time and aggravating. You need to revisit this update and consider rolling it back.",

When our users make custom foods they will soon be able to include the amount of allulose used in the food or recipe.

1848,5,2019-06-06T00:24:16.000Z,Lightoftroy,Best app for carb management!,It’s well worth getting the yearly subscription—hardly anything per day for a killer accountability “partner.”  Love the recipes and the adjustable macros depending on my goals. I actually look forward to entering my food and exercise each day! Thanks!!,
1849,5,2019-06-21T12:55:20.000Z,mandora6614,5 pound in a week,I’ve dropped 5 pounds in the past week with the help of carb manager. Logging everything I eat is pretty tiring but being able to actually SEE my carb intake had made all the difference.,
1850,5,2018-02-20T03:34:10.000Z,Todd Everyman,"The best tracker, not just for low carb",This is by far the most thoughtfully designed tracker for those focused on a keto / paleo / primal way of eating. Frankly I’d use it over MFP even if I weren’t focused on carbs primarily. It’s more user friendly without being feature light.,
1851,1,2018-06-25T02:32:09.000Z,Tangles973,Macros are mostly WRONG,"For instance, I scanned a bottle of dressing into my meal. It had the correct name but totally wrong macros (2tbsp/10gm fat/1 carb per bottle, but scanned input and it says 2tbsp/6gm fat/5carb). Um what? Yeah this messed up my whole macros goal for today. Had two cups of diced chicken breast - 1 cup for two meals - and it said they were 87 gm protein??! Yeah, Back to MFP I’m going. Had heard good things about this app but I’m not impressed. Too bad I signed up for the three month subscription and have already paid it. Oh well.",
1852,5,2018-07-13T15:34:04.000Z,jxqb,16 lbs the first week,Yes it is true. I’ve stayed on this diet as carefully as I can I have not gone over in carbs or calories or anything else. I go to bed satisfied and have not experienced any hunger.,
1853,3,2018-08-20T17:54:36.000Z,Karivan54,Not what I expected,I had a hard time uploading recipes into the app and almost always just had to type it in or cut and paste.  The macros are hidden and takes a bit of searching to find.  I like My Fitness Pal a lot better.  It’s easier to navigate and upload recipes from the web.,

I’ve used carb manager for going on 3 years now and pay for premium but with all the new changes I’m leaning towards cancelling now.

It used to allow you to input the servings in decimal or type a number vs using the wheel selector. I can’t seem to enable that anymore.,"Hi Heather! Things are a wee bit different with the new interface. If you click on ""Enter Your Own"" beside ""Servings"" it will switch up, and you can enter any number (including a decimal) in the box between the ""+/-"" icons!

Been using this app for 3 years and now I’m left with nothing since it’s unusable. Stay away from this app!,

Maybe if you buy the monthly service it works.","Hi there - thanks for the note! So coffee does actually have a small amount of carbs in the form of fiber (little known fact). The adding issue is likely due to rounding, as we don't round values before we add them, but do round them after. To see the full decimal values, please go to Settings > Show Decimal Values.

3572,2,2018-08-20T15:01:48.000Z,artemisinva,Wrong carb amounts,Overall I like the app but the most important thing to track is the carbs and often times this is off and by a lot. For instance when entering salsa your app says 15 net carbs for a 1/4 of a cup. When I look it up I find that it’s has only 3 net carbs. This is very disheartening.,

4058,1,2021-02-20T21:18:11.000Z,OliviaSatan,Keeps getting buggier,With every “update” it crashes more and more often. Cant put in one meal of stuff without it freezing up and having to force exit. Super frustrating after using it happily and almost bug free for three years,

4062,1,2021-02-09T21:54:19.000Z,BigLipp,Update is horrible,A fantastic app I’ve used for years. The newest update has basically made it unusable overnight.

Even bought a 3 month premium once (short on money so can’t always do it).,"Hi UnderPwner - We hear you, and we're sorry to hear that you're not loving the new design. Many users had grown very accustomed to the old design, as it hadn't been updated in awhile. We completely understand that change can be difficult!

4649,5,2019-12-21T01:35:08.000Z,Keto focus,Carb Manager compared to MyFitnessPal and Cronometer,"I have used MyFitnessPal (premium version )For about four years. It is very easy to use and provides just about any information I could’ve ever wanted. My biggest complaint was inaccurate nutritional information on several occasions, but still they are pretty good. What really annoyed me recently was trying to find nutritional info for a common food. For some reason many of the foods in the category I was looking at were printed out in a foreign language (other than English). I had never had that problem before. I told look at Carb Manager and absolutely fell in love with it, having bought the premium version. I am prediabetic and over age 65. Carb manager very well fills my expectations for all types of information that anyone on a keto diet would like to know. Although MyFitnessPal Provided similar information, it wasn’t as focused on keto as carb manager is. I also bought the premium version of Cronometer. Chronometer reviews indicated they were the most accurate of all the nutrition apps, and what little experience I’ve had with it so far I find that to be true. However, extremely high accuracy for nutritional information Hass to be weighed against the quantitative inputs one makes - which is often an estimate. So the overall accuracy of nutritional information for me, was not enough to sell me. Chronometer also had no easy way to input water consumption. Bottom line is that carb manager for me, has the best combination of nutritional information, ease of input and some extremely well laid out navigation within the app.",

4877,5,2019-07-26T11:49:00.000Z,SariAnnelleMartin,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"Okay so I recently got engaged and like most people in a happy relationship I put on some happy weight after being together for 3 years. LOL. I knew that I wanted to lose about 20 pounds before our wedding but I  was CLUELESS on where to begin. I’ve never had a problem with my weight because I’ve always stayed so active, but in the past year I’ve been in nursing school and if you’ve been there, you feel my pain. Finding time to exercise, eat right, study, go to class, clinicals, etc. is TOUGH. So I heard all about the keto diet and figured I’d give it a try. Once again keep in mind I’m clueless about the whole process and I’m the type of person that doesn’t trust just ANY article/post I come across. So I did some research and came across the Carb Manager app and YALL..... it was a game changer. If you’re a beginner like me and don’t know what in the world you’re doing, THIS IS THE APP FOR YOU. Granted, to get the best results from it I do recommend paying for the subscription but it’s WELL worth it. This app literally gives you a TON of recipes, let’s you log which one you’re going to eat that day and makes a dang SHOPPING LIST for you! Does it get much better than that y’all? I think not. There is also a place where you can log your exercise and apply it to your daily intake and you can also keep track of how much water you drink. Mind blown. ALSO you can upload recipes you find on Pinterest etc. to make sure they’re legit (big plus for me because like I said I’m a skeptic about most things LOL) it literally breaks it down into a pie chart for you — and if you’re like me and have an occasional sweet tooth, fret not, because guess what? There’s plenty of dessert recipes too! It gives you all kinds of information about the diet and explains everything to a T. So yeah thanks for coming to my TED talk y’all. LOL...... But seriously though download the app. (:",

5015,5,2020-01-16T13:02:29.000Z,Crgvr68,I SOOO LOVE THIS APP❤️❤️,"I’m so impressed with how user friendly this app is. I started the keto diet in November 2019 and I’ve lost 30 pounds. I started doing this by myself but when my husband would taste my food he wanted it instead of what I made for him. Needless to say, now we’re both doing it! He didn’t need to lose weight but he wanted to do it because it’s a much healthier way of eating and he wanted to support my journey with keto along the way.  At a Christmas party we have with our friends every year all my friends started asking me what I was doing. I asked what they meant because they know I can’t exercise due to a lot of bone, joint, and spinal health issues. They asked what I was doing to lose weight and what I was doing to my skin. I told them I was on the keto diet and what apps I use to help manage and keep me motivated. They were in awe. I had asked my best friend, who was hosting the party, a few days before the party to set a piece of beef roast aside for me before she added anything so I wouldn’t break my diet and that really peaked her interest. Since that night she has asked me a lot of questions about the diet so I’ve referred this app to her. Since I’m at home all day every day I know that it’s much easier for me to stay true to the diet than for those who work out of the home but trust me, it’s still very doable!  I love Lifesum!! I had the app an entire year before I ever used it. I guess I was ready mentally, but after 2 weeks my energy was higher than it had been in years, I lost weight and my skin is glowing! My hair stopped falling out and my nails stopped breaking as much!  If you’re thinking about doing keto I do HIGHLY recommend Lifesum!! You won’t be disappointed!!",

I cant imagine what the problem was prior to their newest problem- kickback from users not happy with the revamp they recently did. Whyyyyyy CM, whyyyyyyy??",
5322,4,2020-09-08T05:36:56.000Z,MonkeyNinjaLove,Good BUT....,"Some bugs--at times the screen for ""go premium"" pops up though I'm already premium and so I have to reload pages. Also, often times I can’t generate a meal plan. Very buggy there. I wish there was a feature for duplicating whole days worth of food for future dates in meal planner at one time, and that you could designate more than one day to copy foods at a time. I don't like literally having to plan meals out one day at a time when I know exactly what I'll be eating for the whole week consists of the same meals prepped for 7 days or more. Also, there is an issue with converting URL recipes, like those from my Pinterest boards, to this app. Since I enjoy dairy free and nearly zero carb meals, in app recipes are very limited for me so this is a feature that I wish were to work more smoothly. Other than that, this app is very intuitive and user friendly programming though, and I love that I can track my insulin doses and blood sugar levels on this as well as ketone levels daily to see how many carbs a day keeps me in or kicks me out of nutritional ketosis. I wish there were more meat free options of recipes for keto dieting, but I love the shopping list action. Though it will add on multiples of the same item in various quantities, it is easy to navigate through while at the store since those items are paired together. So if I see that there is about 60 tbsp of olive oil that I need in one week, then I will make sure to get about 4 cups worth of olive oil for that week or about 32 oz. it takes a little brain math but maybe that's something they will do for members automatically as the app evolves. I would rate it about a 3.5 so I rounded my rating up to 4 stars. I hope my review helped answer some common questions. :)",

5611,3,2018-07-30T00:35:43.000Z,lazulistar,Almost perfect,"I have been trying out two diet apps back to back and find Carb Manager easier to use. You can track not only your weight but measurements and ketones and supplements. The only downside is putting in vitamins is a pain. There should be a way to switch to percentages or IU, but it is stuck in mg/mcg which makes me end up spending way too much time to figure out how much I am getting. The other app I use is all percentages which makes entering custom food quick and easy. The other thing I actually HATE is if you go over your carbs for the day (I had 4 cups of Broccoli for dinner so yeah) your bar/meter goes completely red and makes you feel as if you messed up. They need to get rid of that because I feel as if I am being punished for going say 1 or 2 carbs over my macro amount. I can understand if you went say 40 carbs over then yeah maybe but the red carb meter is too off putting. The app should be rewarding, not punishing. It is easier to look up foods but a lot in the system had nutrition all wrong so I am spending more time entering my food. I don’t see myself sticking with this app unless a few things are changed. I much prefer the other app as it rewards you plus was $10 cheaper for premium. Still I like this app but those few things take up too much time or aggravate me.","Hi there, thanks for the great feedback. Please check Settings > Vitamin D Units for the option to change to IUs from mcgs. There is also an option to have the progress bar turn orange instead of red if you are less than 15% over your carbs goal. Thanks again for using Carb Manager!"

Although I’ve only used this app for 24 hours there are a couple of key differences that make it better if you’re doing KETO. (1) ability to choose your own macros easily and then how it presents them in the daily log. It just works better. (2) How recipes are presented in premium versions are better with CM. (3) The “insights” in lose it were exciting, but they weren’t useful. I think CM has more useful info and less hype. (4) everything else you’d expect in a modern day high end food app is there... and then some. Easy food logging, big database, details out the kazoo etc.",

6305,2,2020-08-01T00:26:29.000Z,BSAJago,Decent tracker but a bit inaccurate,I’ve been using this for over a year now. It’s not terrible but I’m finding a lot of inaccuracies in their food database. Scanned foods are often returned at higher calories and carbs than what’s in the package and I’ve noticed numerous times when quite a few members have reported the inaccuracies and the foods are never corrected. It makes it a bit more tedious to log food as you can’t trust the scan option and you end up having to manually enter all the nutritional info.,Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review. We would love the opportunity to assist you with any issues you are having with the app as well as address any discrepancies you may be experiencing. Please reach out to us in-app at Settings-“Need Help?” and our awesome customer service team can assist you!

Check your packages for a serving size and how many carbs, fats, and calories. I found many foods I use daily are incorrect!! For example, a cheese I eat is calculating an extra carb, an extra fat and an extra calorie, sometimes and extra protein! This is crucial for for me because I just started keto and I can’t go over my macros. So one dinner night, my macro counts for my entire meal we’re 4 or 5 grams over in all 4 of these areas! What upsets me is, I just caught this yesterday, which means for days my macros were way off. I’ve tried to report this in app, it won’t work. So if your going to use this app, double check your macros, which can be done via internet, or packaging!",Hi there!

6360,5,2016-02-21T19:10:34.000Z,Tzippi D,Love Carb Manager,"I think this app is fabulous!  It's everything I wanted. Had to contact Customer Service because I was having trouble signing in but they got back to me in less than 24 hours with a resolution. I purchased the premium app and I'm glad I did. I used the non-premium for awhile but wanted the extras in premium.  There are a couple things I noticed that I hope they ""catch up"" on. As mentioned by another reviewer the search feature does not present an alphabetized list and sometimes I have to switch around word order to find. However, once you put foods in your favorites they are alphabetized. In addition, the water feature is only in 8 oz increments. As I often drink 1/2 cups or 12 oz they should really change this to an ounce feature, or at least tap twice on the glass. Once for 4 oz twice for 8 oz. minor details. PC sync is also very nice. I really like the analyze feature and supplements categories although my supplements don't come up in bar scan and I had to put them in as custom foods. Bar scan is great feature. It's found things I could not find on the search feature right away. Search feature also has numerous quantity selections to choose from so however I measure foods or decide on portions I've never had trouble finding (although sometimes I need to squint to see what the portion size says if it's a really long description).",
6361,5,2017-07-09T16:57:32.000Z,Pradis,Fantastic!,"I have lost 122 lbs with about 65 lbs to go now. I've used Richard Simmons, weight watchers, overeaters anonymous, Jenny Craig,and hypnosis.  Three years ago I was diagnosed with type two diabetes as so many of us Americans now are. I have successfully counted weight watchers points and calories but the ketogenic diet seems to truly be a key piece to my weight-loss puzzle/diabetic management. Both my doctor who is a diabetic specialist and my nutritionist have confirmed that a ketogenic diet is extremely beneficial for type two diabetic patients. But the reality of daily life makes logging grams of carbohydrates a real barrier to staying accountable. Carb Manager is a fantastic app that makes accurately tracking carbohydrate intake as painless and convenient as is probably possible to achieve. I especially like the barcode reader which allows me to get the exact product carbohydrates. I've been using CM now for about two months with great success. Like all of these things YOU have to make time to do it every day. But really it just takes a couple of minutes to log your food. Tracking weight and body size is also super convenient. It's just a great health and nutrition management app. I highly recommend it!","Hi Pradis, wow! Way to go! That absolutely makes our day to hear about amazing, life changing success, and we're delighted that Carb Manager was able to help you along the way.

6370,4,2012-05-03T15:16:02.000Z,janeknife,Search needs refining,"Overall I like this app a lot. If you don't eat a lot of pre-packaged food, it's fairly easy to use. However, the search function is frustrating; what should be a simple search becomes a few minutes of scrolling and reading. A search for half & half turns up at least a hundred items unrelated to half & half. Search for Half AND half and you'll find it. Search for ""hamburger,"" a low-carb mainstay, and you have to scroll through countless variations, ""w/ pickles in bun,"" w/ pickles and onion on bun,"" ""McDonalds with ketchup and pickles on bun."" honestly. How many low-carbers are eating buns and McDonald's burgers... I don't want to scroll through this to get to plain ol hamburger. Also, another example, good luck finding sugar free jello on it, but you can find all manner of regular sugar filled jello. In a low carb app. I ask you! The other issue I do have is that in each individual day's screen, my net carb count is accurate, but in my main screen on the calendar portion my net carbs show me as being way over my 20g goal which is annoying. Overall I like it but the search kills me and the inaccurate carb count in the calendar page annoys me.",
6371,5,2015-08-19T21:42:26.000Z,Jyukon,Awesome App,"Really like this app. It was everything for nutrition that my FitBit app is not. Love the breakdown in carbs, fiber, protein, fat, and macro nutrients. A friend of mine introduced me to carb manager, and even in the short time I have been using it, I have already begun cutting pounds. I exercise a lot, and have had trouble cutting the fat. Diet and rest are the keys to success, and this app has given me the tools to succeed. Barcode scanner works really well. You can create custom foods to enter in supplements. Lots of charts and info. My only drawback is that there is not seamless integration with Fitbit. You have to download another app to export data from Fitbit to Apple Health in order to get your data, but even then, Fitbit is holding up key elements from heart rate and active calories. This is on Fitbit though. They need to play nice. I like my Fitbit, but this makes me want to move over to an apple watch. My wife has one, and there is seamless integration across all apps. Carb Manager is fantastic. Have been pushing it on all my friends. Not just a carb manager. Manage it all.",
6372,2,2016-08-16T18:29:35.000Z,J9OB,Need to be food detective,"The display, intent, and exhaustive list of foods on this app are very good. However, actually tracking food is cumbersome. You have to find the right area to find the food: packaged or common foods. Then go to the right category, and scroll through some more.I tried to track scrambled eggs--plain scrambled eggs--and couldn't find it. There were all sorts of other scrambled eggs in the mix search mix, and other types of plain eggs that I had to scroll past in the common foods area, but no plain scrambled eggs. Then I tried to track a piece of red pepper. Again, lots of scrolling through foods/sections to find the right one. Still didn't find what I was looking for and gave up. You have to do a lot of searching for the foods you want to track. Too much work for me. I've gone back to using the MyNetDiary app. What would help this app is to make it easier to find and track the foods you do eat. The MyNetDiary app lets you put the food in the search area and find what you're eating immediately. Regular foods seem to pop up more often. Then, when you use it again it remembers your top foods. Would love to see this app do the same thing. (Downside of MyNetDiary is that it doesn't easily conform to low carb diets and constantly tells you your food balance is out of whack).  This app may work for more patient folks, but wasn't helpful for me.","Hi there. Thanks for the note -- it's been ranked one of the most helpful, and we appreciate the feedback. The reason we're writing back now (about a year after you first posted) is that recently made some major improvements to food search, and would love for you to give the app another look. Now, search is super fast, accurate, and comprehensive. For example, type ""scrambled eggs"" and exactly that, with an image, will appear. You can find your most commonly eaten foods under Quick Find -> Favorites / Frequent / Recent. Please contact us if you'd like us to walk you through the new app or if you'd like to try out the Premium features. All the best, Team CM. UPDATE: We just licensed over 500,000 foods from the MyNetDiary database. Check it out!"
6373,2,2017-03-11T18:06:22.000Z,Diabetic Mom 0282,Sugar Alcohols N/A,"I bought this program to help me easily count my net carbs. I love the fact that you can scan an item in since I use bars often, like the extend bar, kind bar, or think thins, etc...I was very surprised to find out that extend nutrition says their bar has 1 g net carb and this app says they have 18 g net carbs. I looked at the information tab and found out that sugar alcohols were listed as N/A and would not let me edit that. Regardless the whole point of using the scanner was that the information would be transferred from the product exactly the way the product had listed it. This app decides to not allow sugar alcohols unless you do a custom food product and make it yourself. I don't mind doing this but the only reason I bought the program in the first place was so I wouldn't have to do this. Just scan and go is what I was looking for. I tried to get customer service and no one has responded. I guess I'm stuck with this product but I probably won't use it much and don't really recommend it if this is what you wanted to use it for or if you're counting your net carbs.","Hi there, we just wanted to let you know that we've added hundreds of thousands of verified foods, and our foods now include sugar alcohols info.

6375,5,2017-06-26T00:19:56.000Z,Charlie Mix,Best app to manage daily carb intake,I credit this app for assisting me in losing over 30 lbs and cutting my body fat from 34% to 21% after using for 10 months. Of course I also worked out but previously had little progress in dropping weight. Once I used this app to manage my daily carb and calories intake I started dropping weight. I feel energized and my appetite has greatly decreased as a result of stabilizing my insulin levels due to proper carb management. I don't eliminate carbs just minimize. Also allows me to still eat things I have a hankering for throughout the day but in smaller portions or choosing alternatives that are lower in carbs. Helps me to be flexible with a dynamic diet as opposed to a static diet. I'm 49 years old and was amazed that my metabolism can almost function at a 20 yr old level when properly managing carb intake. Can't live without this app. I'm still making progress and now have a target of 15% body fat. I'm leaner and have decent muscle definition as a result. Everyone thinks I'm in my mid 30's. Not bad for a soon to be a 50 year old man.,"Hi Charlie, wow! Congratulations on you fantastic success with your low carb diet. There are so many benefits to going low carb, and I think that its advantages over the low calorie approach are finally becoming widely known. I'm really glad that Carb Manager has been helpful to you in progressing toward your goals. Please keep in touch and let us know when you get to 15%! And do check out our latest version and send your feedback. Best wishes!"
6376,1,2017-06-27T13:02:17.000Z,Al Geared,Time to drop this app...,"I'll go back to pencil and paper before I will struggle with this another hour. Was concerned as I watched it auto update this morning. Tried it and was very disappointed. Why does everything need rings just because Apple Watch has it??? I got rid of the rings and got a completely meaningless pie chart as I had only entered 1 item for the day. Tried editing my last item from last night as planned and it was a nightmare. The simple wheel of portions and measurement are gone. I hate tapping +++ vs ---.  The user interface is blurry. I actually saw 1-1/2 in font that was barely readable. Additional analysis charts  are there but I am not 'anal' and they are hard to read. Plus you do not know my goals and my goals are none of your business. But as I played with them, it is not easy,  not intuitive, and presumes too much on the part of the app. All I want is a count of carb, fat and protein. Period.","Hi Al, we appreciate your input and hope you will consider giving the new version another chance. We've increased font sizes, and fixed a few bugs. For the food picker, you can now use the + and - buttons to change the value, or just tap on the field and enter a value with the keypad. Try it out for a while and let us know where we can improve. We really do listen to feedback and make changes based on what users want."
6377,5,2017-07-08T03:58:36.000Z,TeamHMama,Latest Update is Great!,"The updated Carb Manager App has added more features that make it even more user friendly. I like the new recipe database, it allows you to search over 360,000 recipes while using the app. If you feel stuck in your meal options, simply search for new ones and the app will save them for you and figures the carbs, calories, etc. This is a great option! There are also more analysis reports available with a breakdown of the vitamins and nutrients you are or are not getting from the foods you eat, which I find helpful. As well as water intake and exercise, the amount of sleep you get a night is also featured on the app. I like this addition and think it helps with my overall health. The Carb Manager app is a great tool for a busy lifestyle, not only for low carb eating but for charting one's health. I highly recommend this app to anyone wanting to be more aware of what they are eating.",
6378,4,2017-07-13T17:39:37.000Z,ThisNicknameIsReallyNotTaken,Powerful but awkward,"The app is great at tracking nutrient and carbs. However the interface is confusing and editing meals/food items is arrived from various places with different effects. Sometimes editing a nutrient value doesn't change it. Pictures come out sideways or not at all. Taking a picture of a meal as you are about to eat it requires creating a meal first and then adding the picture (granted you can go back and add ingredients later but it's not clear how to do that.) Perhaps a bit more time with app will help wire my brain to its interface design choices, but in the meantime I'm tapping around to figure how to edit things or making my daily adding of things more efficient.",
6379,3,2017-08-15T14:43:40.000Z,Sarbelgian,When it works ...,"When this app works it's great and inputs are easy, but it seems like if you are not on WiFii it rarely works so I have to remember to add things when I get back on WiFii and about 3-4 times per week, even on WiFii it's not working so I have to add things when I can finally get it to respond.  During these times, I am able to see the foods I have saved in my 'favorites' but when I click to add it does not allow me to add them.  I have checked my WiFii connections and turned off WiFii to see if this makes a difference - to no avail.  Seems like this is a bug that the developer needs to fix.  The only other complaint is that if I eat out you cannot access very many particular foods at specific restaurants,  many of the other apps let you access complete restaurant menu's that you can search but this app seems to have very little menu access for common restaurants.  While this is not as big an issue as the other 2 it can make this app a little less convenient to utilize.",
6380,5,2011-06-09T16:36:24.000Z,Willowupnorth,Great Atkins counter!,I just purchased this app today and played around with it for a couple hours and this works great despite some bad reviews. The database is vast but you need to learn how to use the search engine. May be the Foods By Category could be broken down a little better.,
6381,4,2011-08-17T13:01:06.000Z,TomGaussiran,Search is main weakness,"Very nice app overall. Seems to be well organized and thought out in most details except for the search function. First, unlike most modern searches there is no type ahead feature. Secondly and more annoying to me is that the search is done in an 'or' sense rather than 'and'. By that I mean that if you were searching for 'caesar salad dressing' and typed in all those words you would get matches off of each word. So rather than narrowing your search it actually returns more results.",
6382,1,2011-08-31T23:02:32.000Z,Disappointed 243,Useless. Missing lots of natural foods.,"After reading the reviews for the old version, I was hoping the new version would be better so I bought it. What a waste of money. If you are already on a whole food diet, don't expect to find many food items here. Lots of natural cheeses are missing, there isn't a red potato or other variety other than white unless it's a deep fried chip. Milk is limited, couldn't find coconut milk or almond milk or any other alternates either, but they do have every kind of processed cow and infant formula. You can find almost any processed or fast food on here. In order to find the few raw items, you have to scroll through HUNDREDS of processed food items. There are lots of greens added, however. I would like to see more menus with unprocessed, non-packaged food items separated from the rest. I've just spent a  little more than a hour sorting through it, and only found about a dozen foods to add to my favorites. This is useless as it doesn't have lots of the food I eat. You are better off researching your food items on the internet and tracking the carbs in a notebook.",
6383,5,2013-10-21T23:56:22.000Z,Mjgator,"Fantastic, better than $50 programs","Just what the paleo doctor ordered. A very similar program paleo tracker goes for $1 per week. Can't beat carb tracker. However, the graphs don't have a vertical axis. You can certainly see the trends, but have to touch each data point to see what it is. Also regarding tracking your weight, there's no way to set the date range, so when you look at the graph it goes from the beginning and you have to scroll for years just to see how you did over the last month. Nevertheless, this is the best carb or paleo tracker out there. I wish there was a way to get averages over a user-defined period (like the past month). Your only choice is to look at a graph and guess.  I wish you could edit dates weights were taken. I made a mistake and there is no way to change date",
6384,3,2016-03-03T22:13:02.000Z,Mignym,Good and bad,"The good: keeps good track of carbs, plus calories, fat, fiber, etc.  The charts are nice. I like the pie chart and that the overview tells what percentage of your carb goal you've had that day.",

This app is easy, intuitive, and quick. I am just getting used to the new format since the most recent update so I haven't decided which I like better (old or new) but I do like some of the added features (adding a note, being able to add to a previous day something you may have forgotten or in my case, fell asleep before it was added) so I'm thinking this new layout will be awesome once I get used to it. I can't say enough how appreciative I am of the quick response I got from the support team as I literally can't go without this app since I started my ketogenic diet 4 months ago. I know there are other apps out there but this one's the best!",

6388,5,2017-04-29T22:10:24.000Z,Rhopage,Love the app,"I started using this to actively watch how many carbs I was eating instead of guesswork. As as diabetic it has made a huge difference in my numbers. Seeing the carb totals and adding them up throughout the day really helps to make better choices. My blood sugar has gone down 10 points, and only within a few  weeks! I have to add that along with this app I also purchased a Fitbit and together they have worked miracles. They go hand in hand perfectly.",

I'm still giving it 5 stars because the developers are in the process of fixing the bugs. Here's my pros and not so pro about the update:","Hi Linda, thanks again for the feedback! We're working overtime to make this update perfect, and really appreciate your input."

Carb manager is great for tracking nutrition and weight in a simple, well-designed interface. It keeps an easy to use ongoing log so that you can keep track of net carbs, very helpful for those of us following the Atkins plan, as well as other nutritional variables. There is a fine visual display that gives you a quick sense of the day's nutrition, a very comprehensive database of foods, and a weekly  graphing function. The developer is very responsive to suggestions, sometimes turning around updates virtually overnight. The app continues to improve with each update. Highly recommended.",
6391,4,2011-09-03T14:49:51.000Z,aradasky,Almost five stars,"I love this app. I have tried several others, found several that I have to sit at my computer that are just as good, but I wanted something that I could use with my iphone and iPad.

I wanted to drop more so I went back into weight loss mode. I lost 20 lbs, and stayed there for two months. Then I got this app and it has been amazing!! I have dropped another five lbs! It's not hard to see myself on a size seven, started as a size twenty four,I'm  a ten now :-)  It's super easy to use, shows all your Nutrition values, vitamins, and more!! I can also add items when I can't find them, along with adding  all the specs. Without this App I seriously don't think I could have figured out how to drop my last thirty pounds, thank you for this wonderful App!!!",

6394,5,2015-01-22T13:57:46.000Z,appleinwinter,Some limitations - but overall really great,"This is a smart, simple app that's easy to use. It adds partial carbs into your daily total, so you don't end up with lots of uncounted fractions. It doesn't have much a database of branded foods -- just foods themselves -- so you don't have to sift through a list (as on WW or Atkins) that's basically a commercial. You can search using just a few letters. On the down side, carb counts in the app don't always match counts on packaging. There's no way to mark favorites, so you always have to re-find foods. A lot of low-carb vegetarian staples are not listed (why not unsweetened soy milk?) But as a decent, easily adaptable, free app that's not tied to a giant corporation trying to profit off of yo-yo dieters, it gets all the love.",

6396,4,2015-08-01T02:57:40.000Z,Karenshere,Just what I was looking for!!,"This is a great little app, once you get used to using the different features. The search feature is not exactly alphabetical so you do have to adjust your search by learning how they categorize there food groups. However, there's a great little custom tool to add your favorite foods or recipes, as well as a scan button to scan in packaged foods. Total carbs, plus net carbs, as well as total calories and protein, track everything you need. It also allows you to set your goals for each of these macros. And you can track your exercise calorie burn. So helpful for low-carb high-fat diet!! It also will allow you to track other nutrients if you desire. Worth it!!!",
6397,4,2016-07-06T13:47:14.000Z,Savage Crowbar,Great tool for obtaining weight loss goal,"I use this app all throughout the day to manage my diet and track my exercise. I can instantly check net carbs and calories of food.  Tracking consumption is also very easy. I will give it 5 stars when they 1) also remove alcohol surgars from net carbs, 2) when you are adding foods you have eaten during the day list other foods that you normally eat with those foods so you can more quickly update your tracker and 3) modify the software to update directly with Fibit to bring in walking etc.  I think they were doing this with their failed update.  It is still a great app that has become a vital part of my life in helping keep my healthy lifestyle on track.",
6398,5,2017-02-17T23:57:53.000Z,Cypressav,Great App but I wish it did this.....,"I am so glad I came across this app. It has helped me tremendously in figuring out my keto diet. It automatically gives me the % of carbs (net AND total! Yay!) proteins and fats. I appreciate the ""scan barcode"" feature as it makes logging packaged foods so easy. The only thing that is missing for me is the ability to log your own recipe and have it figure out the percentages per serving size. That would be incredibly helpful. I believe you have to pay for the yearly subscription for that feature. Even my free calorie counter app gave that option. Otherwise, this has been wonderful in helping me keep track of my food, water and exercise.",
6399,5,2017-07-20T11:58:26.000Z,Southernbelleriggs,Very Helpful but ...,"There are a few small things could be improved:  when you are searching for more than one food, you can click in the search bar and backspace/delete the last item you searched for, Which is time consuming and aggravating, but if you ""X"" out of the last item, it takes you out of the search field all together so you have to click back in the search bar. When searching for one food, neither is a problem, but when searching for multiple items, it gets old really quickly. And I have to say that I prefer the previous version much more.",
6400,2,2011-01-23T01:23:53.000Z,ErikT,Concept is good -  But search Poor,"The concept of this app is very good and the visual display of the graphs is clear and easy to understand..  HOWEVER - the search process really puts this app significantly behind competitors.  Searching for something simple like ""cheese"" doesn't bring you to the most basic listing from which to find the cheese you're looking for.  You have to scroll and scroll through seemingly endless, often completely unrelated entries before you can find something that resembles the basic term you were searching for.   More complex searches are even more fraught with unrelated items.   If they can develop a better search feature, I may reinstall it.  But for now, I cannot recommend this app.  There are others in the app store that do this much better.",

This app has helped me to do so. Keeping a journal here is much easier than pen & paper charting. I have used the custom foods tab a lot to input the specific brands & amounts. Having a way to input sugar alcohols would be nice. I work around this by including these in the fiber when setting up custom foods such as Atkins products. There seems to be repetition in the database of foods. Also, I'm not sure what NS means. Setting up a custom food when in doubt takes care of these issues.

It's a hassle switching between all the screens to log food and then see what your daily overview is after you entered something. So I paid for the sync ability to use it on my desktop thinking that if I was planning my day of eating it would be easier there and then I could do small changes on the app itself. Wrong! The desktop version is just as frustrating! Clicking from page to page to search and enter foods, then switch again for the overview. Wish they would streamline the page bc otherwise it's a good app.",
6406,4,2016-07-19T14:56:09.000Z,Talljinx,Great Tool for Counting Carbs,"I've been using the app to log everything I'm doing on the Atkins plan.  It's very simple to navigate the app.  The food database is decent and it's very easy to add a food to the database if necessary.  Also tracking exercise and things like weight and body measurements are very basic as well.  The only thing I would question would be some of the exercise database's calories-burned estimates.  For example, I do Tai Chi.  The exercise database says that 30 minutes of Tai Chi burns 254 calories. With the slow movements of Tai Chi, I find that to possibly be wrong.  Other than than that, this app is a great addition to anyone's arsenal of healthy living trackers.",

Every time I try to change a setting, the wheel turns but then it goes back to the same screen. They added a progress circle which is almost impossible to see at a glance what your macros are. It would be so much better to have a progress bar for each macro like they do for net carbs. I would rather see at a glance horizontal colored bars instead of a confusing circle where it's impossible to tell percentages around a circle.","Hi Diana, we had a server outage yesterday that was causing some loading problems, but it has since been resolved.

Get rid of duplicate entries in database.  4.  Add sugar alcohol option in nutrition data entry so that net carb count is correct when entering Atkins foods.

It is a useful app but it could be better. When you update please consider 1. Improving the food search. It works about half the time. 2. Most people eat the exact same meal at least at breakfast. Please add a ""save meal "" search so we can enter a whole meal at once. ( look at Lose It.  Not a good carb app at all but their meal save is well done and even let's you edit) 3.

It isn't user friendly as is My Fitness Pal that I've been using but it has glitches as well. I find it hard to believe that when you purchase a bundle and only one or two of them work well. I doubt that my paying an extra yearly fee will improve things. It is, however, less costly than the $9.99 monthly fee that My Fitness Pal charges. I would gladly give it a 5 star rating but I need to experience a few more improvements to the app.",

Another commenter said it isn't and that almost prevented me from getting the app. But I ate almost not packaged foods today and had no trouble finding plain ingredients. Also scanned a barcode and the food came up quickly. The green color at the top is a bit garish, but otherwise I'm loving this app.",

MFP doesn't cater to low carb (but they can for $10 a month). I bought this app and I haven't looked back. It's fantastic. The barcode scanner is the best I've used. Entering food is easy and doesn't take long at all and is very precise with the various serving sizes (I weigh my food out and go by grams). I love looking at my macros and knowing that's EXACTLY what I've consumed today. I recommend this app to every low carb/keto person I know.,

I loved being able to know that in a glance without having to open the app. I'll continue to use it because I've been so successful with logging but it's definitely not as user friendly as the previous version.,

This app is perfect if you make a mistake and put in the wrong number or put things on the wrong day you can go back and edit anything. This is very helpful and making dieting that much easier. The last thing somebody wants to go through when they're going through sugar withdrawal is more complications and stress. Thanx 😄,
6434,5,2015-01-25T21:33:57.000Z,Cindylou48,Old version good new is better,"I use this daily. One reason I love the new version is because it has predict when looking for foods. It also has some other features such as an exercise log that calculates calories. Being able to save your favorite foods is also a good feature. It was in the old version also but seems better this time. Overall, they have added some really nice features to an already excellent program.",
6435,5,2015-05-03T15:42:17.000Z,Ukiacat,Excellent carb tracker!,"Super helpful app! I've been using this app for a couple weeks and really like it. It's thorough, easy to use, the barcode scanner is convenient and quick. I'm learning a lot about carbs in my diet. I also like the daily total nutrient info. I discover more features as I become more familiar with the app. Today I discovered how to find the nutritional value of individual foods (tap the i that is to the top right side of the food you have selected). Highly recommend this app.",
6436,3,2015-07-23T10:45:07.000Z,annajacq,Could be better.,"I have been using this for over a month and in some ways it's great. I love the way when you plug in your foods it takes it right to a pie chart to see exactly what your fat/ protein/ carb ratios are for instance. The one thing that is driving me nuts is when you are searching for foods the order makes no sense and is frustrating. For instance; search for beef and it starts with beef salad, beef jerky, beef curry, ect. Takes a lot of searching and not even alphabetical. Also has lots of prepared foods which are not on my diet anywhere. Food lists could make much better sense.",
6437,5,2016-07-08T11:55:55.000Z,literaryfitz,Great even for beginners,"Used this app regularly for 2 months in the fall and did awesome tracking and staying within my carbs helping jump start my weight loss. I've looked at other apps out there and like the simplicity of this one.  Sure it's kinda hard to figure out at first, but any diet tracking app is until you get used to it. Tracking definitely helps with weight loss and food choices. I could see how those who do bodybuilding would like this app as well.",
6438,5,2016-09-16T02:15:12.000Z,7001kkj,Keto-Riffic!,This app is great and helps me stay accountable on my keto journey. I love the pie charts and nutrient counts. Frequently eaten food buttons and Favorites help me speed right through my logging. Can't wait to get sync'd up with my Fitbit. It should be further noted that the customer service is on point here. Not only did I get speedy responses to an inquiry but two days later I received an unsolicited follow up email to let me know the issue was fixed and I was ready to proceed. I couldn't believe it! So awesome!,
6439,4,2017-04-12T19:36:22.000Z,ProtoBadger,"Easy to use, easy to follow.",This app is easy to use.  It has a lot of products already but allows you to customize everything and make your own entries. You can even upload you own pictures.  The only problem right now I can't copy items from previous days even though it use to work.  The work around is adding everything you eat regularly to your favorites list.  It will even remember the quantity you used. I'll will add I'm not using premium and I still get a lot of good features.,
6440,5,2012-04-27T03:33:14.000Z,EsperanzaCisne,LOVE THIS APP!!!!,This is a GREAT app - I use it several times daily. I love the ability to add custom foods and favorites. The index is a little overwhelming at first but once you get used to using everything it's really quite simple and functional. (I do wish it were a little easier to go in and edit custom food entries once you've made them without having to delete and start over.) The graphs and pie charts are a TERRIFIC feature. All in all I'd give it am A+! Thanks!,
6441,4,2015-11-01T18:06:05.000Z,j_ski,Good app,I really like the focus on carbs as opposed to calories which is something very few apps do. For the most part it's pretty easy to use and has a decent amount of searchable foods although it could use more. I also like the Apple Watch version of the app. My only complaint is the subscription fee just to share my data with the health app. I'd rather pay a one time minimal fee to have the option (although it should be free with a paid app) than paying a ridiculous yearly fee.,
6442,5,2016-03-07T01:57:18.000Z,Lovereza,What I've been looking for !,I have been doing Atkins for almost two years. I've lost and maintained my 60 lbs weight loss but now I'm trying to lose just another 15 lbs. ( the stubborn lbs )  I want to be extra diligent. I have tried my fitness pal and liked it but never got what I wanted out of it as far as carb tracking. This app is everything I've been looking for. I highly recommend it. It can be tedious to track but I believe it's worth it.,

I was in ketosis, but my weight loss completely stalled - bizarrely at the same time I began high intensity workouts. Thanks to carb manager I figured out I was eating TOO MUCH protein and not enough fat! (I assumed with the gym I needed to add low carb protein shakes). I lost 2 lbs. after the first day of using it and my weight loss is back on track steady thanks to this amazing app. Seriously considering going with the premium yearly package I find this app so awesome!",
6444,5,2016-09-10T00:34:16.000Z,Kirby177,Great app,I like how this integrates with the apple health app and shows calories in addition to carbs.  The barcode feature is great and there are a lot of foods in the data base.  I do wish you could repeat certain meals easily rather than enter each food one by one again.  And I wish you could delete foods from the frequently eaten list as they seem to stay there indefinitely even if you added it only once.,

Since the updates there hasn't been a time I opened the app and it responded as it should. Lagging issues, measurement/servings are off, even down to the easy to read pie chart being all grey and categories have no value. I'll continue to update the app regularly but honestly if it isn't turned around soon I'll just find a better app.","Hi there, thanks for the feedback and for using Carb Manager. We rolled out a bunch of new updates recently, including voice logging, a snap-a-pic feature, a better food database, and free recipes. There were a few hiccups which we apologize for, but everything should be ironed out now. Please contact us at support@wombatapps.com and we'll help you address any issues."
6447,5,2017-04-01T19:25:50.000Z,Ghetto1987,Issues after update,This app was awesome until the last update. For a few days it crashed and lagged so much it was almost unusable. That has improved but now the pie chart is always grey. That's not that big of a deal but the colors are definitely nice for quick recognition.,

This app is helpful, although the proportional although the partial numbers on the measurements are a bit weird. Most Americans would divide cups into eighths rather than tenths, so it is a little difficult to make the numbers on my food scale match up to the numbers on the app. Prior versions had a favorites list in which I could enter custom food, but I haven't found that in this version.","Hi there, thanks so much for the stars! To find the favorites list, please go to the food finder -> Quick Find -> Favorites. For custom foods, go to the food finder -> My Foods -> Custom. We'll definitely look into adding eighths to the wheel picker. If you have a minute, would you mind checking out the latest version and sending your feedback? Many thanks!"

It's definitely easier to input your foods and facts then search for them; just enter it right the first time as there's no edit function.  If you make an error entering in the facts, you have to delete it and start over.  The process is really easy though.  Overall, I really like it to track my carbs and calories! Definitely worth it!",
6451,5,2015-04-26T12:21:36.000Z,Mamamermaids,Great app,I really like this app. I've had it about a week and have lost 3lbs. I used to do weight watchers and am the type of person that needs structure when trying to lose weight and this app helps. I like that they have a huge list of foods to choose from and you can create your own and add it and even make it a favorite. I have recommended this to others as well and I am sure it will help then as well.,

Cheddar cheese and bacon are down a page or 2 below soups and other recipes when searching for those items. Other than that which is solved by using frequently eaten foods it works great and does what you are looking for. Also $20 for the year for the upgraded version is a good deal compared to other similar apps.",
6454,5,2016-05-01T15:18:10.000Z,Dambros13,Incredibly helpful for a vegetarian!,"Just started a Keto diet and this app has been really instrumental in helping me get the hang of ultra low-carb, especially as a vegetarian with fewer low-carb choices. Only question I have is why it deducts only fiber, and not sugar alcohols, in order to calculate net carbs. That might have more to do with my beginner's understanding of Keto and less to do with the app, but throwing it out there to the app designers, for what it's worth. Thanks, Carb Manager! Viva low carb!",
6455,5,2016-07-02T15:03:49.000Z,Cyn d Lou who,My video game,"I got the carb manager after Atkins changed theirs. Carb manager was very easy to use and I truly loved it!! My kids laughed because it was my video game. I could put in different meals before I ate to see what the carbs calories were. I loved it! Then they changed it. Was very sad 😞,but they listened to US and changed it back. Thanks for going back to the way it was. It helped me lose 30 lbs.  I could keep a check on my macros. I love it.",

If I could go to a previous day and have the ability to pull a food from that day's foods into today's foods, it would save so much time!  Also, when creating a customized food there's no place to log sugar alcohols in the nutrition information. If a food has sugar alcohols, I have to subtract those from the total carbs before entering it so the net carbs are correct.",

Also the fact that you can scan a barcode for unknown foods and it appears instantly. Just a fantastic product. Highly recommend!",

The calculation for net carbs isn't the same as Atkins. There is no way to subtract sugar alcohols along with fiber; therefore, an Atkins product, for example, that really has 3 net carbs will show up on this app as having consumed 13 net carbs-very deceiving  and also impossible to keep your carb limit. Also, this app has a blank for every other nutrient etc that you can think if but no sodium intake option. In addition the app is much slower than it should be. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is trying to stick with net carb intake limits.",

Entered some items I thought were for yesterday, but they showed up on my today.  Couldn't figure how to move them without starting all over.

This would be a good app with a way better food data base.  It doesn't have your basic Atkins foods in there so you have to customize which doesn't subtract sugar alcohols so the carb count is never correct.,

However, I would like to be able to make changes to already entered custom foods. I would also like to be able to go to a previous day and find a meal that took me a long time to enter and just copy it to another day. Maybe future updates will have these capabilities similar to My  Fitness Pal.",
6492,5,2016-07-07T03:13:31.000Z,Wilsonbjp,absolutely love this app,I've used this app for a couple days now to enter all my meals and have had no issues whatsoever.  I love the ability to just scan a barcode  and all the info is automatically filled in.  I've also successfully entered a custom food item that wasn't in the database.  Everything has been extremely easy.,
6493,5,2016-09-01T15:58:03.000Z,Jane Fournier,Love this App,I have been using this app every day for 13 months ( 114 #) It is easy to use and does everything I need for my low carb program. I use the custom food section for my favorite foods that vary in carbs.,
6494,5,2016-10-01T02:35:36.000Z,Sundown45,"This is easy to use, and does what I need.","I would have given this a five star rating if there were a way to connect my Fitbug up to it, so that I don't have to use separate apps every day. I would upgrade to premium in a heartbeat if I could do just that one extra thing, because there are some really great extra benefits that come with premium .",
6495,5,2016-11-19T15:55:44.000Z,AlwaysTempted,Nice variety of features,"Between the scanner, name brand product listing and the generic listing I can almost always find the foods I am about to eat and reasonable options of portion sizes to log. This good information allows me to make better decisions about my choices. I like that the charts allow you to set targets and them visually represent your progress.",
6496,5,2017-02-16T15:26:20.000Z,Coolzombie76,Highly Recommend!!,This app is great! It is so easy to use and makes eating low carb visually apparent.  Bravo Carb Manager! I tried another carbohydrate tracker app before a friend told me about this one. The app I used before paled in comparison. I'm upset I wasted so much of my time trying to figure out and use the other app.  I would recommend this app to anyone interested in counting carbohydrates.,
6497,4,2017-03-21T00:34:17.000Z,BKali,Room for improvement,"Overall, this is the best app I have used to track net carbs on a ketogenic diet since it automatically subtracts fiber and sugar alcohols from the total carb count. Note to the developer; it would be nice to be able to easily copy an entire meal from one day to another without having to add item by item. Most of my meals are repetitive so it would be nice to ""copy breakfast"" from one day to another. Thank you.",
6498,4,2017-04-02T01:01:47.000Z,Erikabubble,Downgraded with last update,I have been using this app for several months and was quite happy. Then this past week there was an update that changed the look of things and downgraded some features. Took the colors off the pie chart and now it's all gray. Not happy with the recent update at all. Now they are pushing to subscribe to premium version by taking away key features on the free version. Bummed.,"Hi there, to fix the pie chart's colors, please open the Settings page. We actually made recipes free in the latest update, plus increased the free voice logging & snap a pic actions to 3 per day. Please contact us at support@wombatapps.com if you need any additional help. Thanks!"

Now I can only enter in .5 intervals???? Who loses or gains in .5 intervals???? Well sorry, I only lost .2lbs since yesterday and I can't log it. Can you please fix that? Actually, just go back to the old interface. It was easy. I didn't even finish logging my foods yesterday because I didn't have time to figure it out.","Hi there, thanks for the feedback. You can enter your weight in decimals now. Thanks again for using Carb Manager."

The search is a bit hard to work through, there are a lot of items, it might be better if there were more sub-catergories, also it would be nice if there was a decimal for entering the nutricional information on the custom food menu, other than those two things, i think its a great app, i love the charts and all the graphs that let you track your progress",

Realistically a single app could not cover these details for every conceivable food on Earth, but this app will give you the nutrition information on most any food you require. Additionally, it will produce useful graphs of your food intake and willow you to input the data so you can graph out your weight loss progress. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",
6502,5,2014-10-22T18:47:30.000Z,RichardNSS,Great app!,"I love this app! Entering food eaten is simple and straightforward, and results are displayed clearly. A suggestion for a future feature would be to include fats and proteins on the main screen. I'm doing a ketogenic diet, which requires not only that I limit my carbs but also that I eat adequate fat and moderate protein, so it would be nice to see these listed on the main screen in addition to carbs.",
6503,5,2015-01-25T13:57:57.000Z,Romana-Mom,Love It,I am recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic and this is by far the best app I've found for keeping track of carbs. The food lookup is wonderful. I've added numerous custom foods from my own recipes. The calculations are easy and a real help in keeping track of my eating habits. This app is easy to learn to use and allows you to start small and increase complexity as you go.,
6504,4,2015-04-19T16:43:51.000Z,Anoosh8358,Love it! 😃,"I just started using this app a few days ago and am enjoying it.  Searching foods is easy. One thing I would like to see on it is a recipe builder where you can add all your recipe ingredients in one place and it calculates the carbs. Another thing that would be nice is a place you can save your frequently used recipes and use one click to add the carbs. If these 2 things are in the app, I didn't see them.",

Super easy to track carbs: barcode scanner, voice logging, snap-a-pic logging and of course, simple searching. My frequent entries are only a tap away! Carb Manager tracks weight, body measurements, BMI, exercise & water intake, etc., plus it gives you a complete nutrition analysis.  Carb Manager makes carb tracking easy.

Now I'm trying to get a grip on my inflammation issues and my doctors recommended a low carb/keto diet.  This is helping me make meals my family (and me) still like and keep my carbs low to stay in ketosis.,
6508,3,2017-06-13T04:46:30.000Z,Tamienne,Pretty good but with some issues,"I really like it but I wish it wouldn't crash so often. I've restarted my phone and still it crashes. So far it crashed when I was picking KFC green beans a few days ago and now it's crashing on my Michelob Ultra. Also, I wish there was a way to 'low carb' foods. For instance, if I order a burger and don't eat the bun or even order it low carb (some places put it on lettuce instead of bread). Would help keep my numbers a little more accurate.",
6509,5,2017-07-09T15:54:41.000Z,Jenni__D,Edited after they fixed issue,EDITED: they fixed the issue quickly & replied to let me know. App is perfect now!,"Hi Jenni, thanks for getting in touch. We've fixed this, so your selection will now save. Hope this helps. If this works for you, would you consider updating your review? Many thanks!"
6510,5,2014-03-11T13:11:46.000Z,ASOhio,Only one shortfall,"The search database for food is incredibly comprehensive. That's a good thing! However, it's a bit cumbersome to use, and takes some retraining on how to get the result your looking for. The only thing in this app that needs a little attention is the search field. The calculator, extensive database, goal charting and planning portions are all fantastic!",
6511,4,2015-04-04T15:29:06.000Z,TheDollyCat,Good but could use some improvements,Has a good library and I like how the data is visually summarized. I wish you could add food right from the summary page instead of having to go back into the menu. I also wish the search recognized misspelled words better. If you don't type it exactly as it's spelled it won't be able to return results and who really knows how to spell rhubarb?,
6512,5,2016-02-08T15:16:11.000Z,JoyfulAlice,Great for my life,"Easy to find foods. Amazing range of items it will find, such as obscure seaweed snacks by brand name. I like the analyses with pie charts of macros and also measurement tools. I had a different app earlier that was hard to use and would freeze. This one always works.  The favorites list is easy to work with and the display tells me exactly what I want to know.",

It took many attempts to find a fried egg. I uploaded two, free Apps that are easy, quick, and the search engine works. It shouldn't be complicated to log everyday foods. Save your money - unclear why there are high reviews. I must be missing something.",
6515,5,2017-03-15T17:23:59.000Z,kjwulff,Works Very Well,"The interface could be a little more intuitive, but overall I'm really impressed by this app. Easy to use, doesn't crash, the scanning feature works really well.

6516,4,2017-05-01T15:15:51.000Z,Mitzib2918,Great app!!,I use this app for my low carb dieting and for tracking my foods. I have the yearly membership and I like that too. The only thing I would change about it is the analysis. It tells you what your low or high in but it would be better if it told you what foods you should eat to get your minerals in every day. Other than that it's a great app and well put together! Simple and easy to use!!,

I found frustrating not being able to quick track carbs and getting messages that I was eating too much fat. Until I found this app, was the best. You can track weight. Input recipes, look for the amount of carbs certain foods have. Love it.","Hi there, thanks for the note! Absolutely - this app is specifically designed for low carb / keto dieters, for which the generic food trackers just aren't suited. Glad you like the recipes sections and weight tracking feature.

Takes too long to enter some foods, and it doesn't have realistic options for what you're looking for. Correct answers are far down the list, so it's time consuming. Too many minor, unimportant suggestions for foods. I'm sure this will get better, because it seems to be off to a good start.",

It seemed to freeze up not letting me click on anything, add anything, basically it was just an image on the screen.  I deleted the app and reinstalled it. After that it worked fine again....for about three hours. I'm about to delete it a second time and probably for the last time.  I wish it worked the way it is supposed to as I really liked all of the features. Unfortunately I have to advise you - don't waste your money.",

Super simple foods are impossible to find, like grilled chicken,  Leafy salad, tomatoes, it's more for packaged store bought foods. Hard to find real food at all. Too much to weed through. Switching back to my fitness pal, it's not low carb but it's a lot easier to use. Took me 20 minutes to enter my home made salad. If you prepare meals at home, this app is too tedious.",

6554,5,2017-03-22T23:29:44.000Z,roodyw,Good carb counter that shows fiber.,"I use this app for logging food intake and initially chose it because of the visibility of fiber on the dashboard which wasn't visible in the other trackers I had used.  It has a good overview for seeing net carbs, carbs, protein, fat, calories, and fiber. They have been responsive when I needed help, or when there were bugs.",
6555,4,2017-03-23T23:24:27.000Z,Slw12,Review,"I used the app for a month, and even recommended it to a group of people with this eating style. Then it updated. All the nutritional information and service sizes are way of. I don't have time to manually input all of my food and thats why I paid for this app. I have updated it to the newest version today. Still doest work. Please fix it or refund me!","Thanks for the feedback, and sorry for the glitch! It's now been fixed. For any lingering issues, please go the the Settings Page, then turn ""Use kiloJoules"" on and then off. This will reset the app and restore all of the serving sizes."

Also keeps track of weight, water and exercise. If you need more you can upgrade. I have lost 16 pounds with help of this app. Would and do highly recommend.",
6557,5,2017-04-04T17:33:01.000Z,Bageving,Quick carb check,I don't track everything everyday but I do use this site several times a week to check on carbs. Sometimes food is cooked in a manner that increases carbs. I have found several food items in this app that change with different cooking methods. Love it!,
6558,5,2017-04-05T15:42:22.000Z,Ashley B1924,Best app for diet tracking,I have used several different apps to track my keep diet and carb manager is by far the most user friendly. There are pictures and settings to make your tracking and selection easy so that I am not wasting lots of time or getting frustrated and quitting,

I also would like a feature on how much natural sugar we should be getting. Obviously ideally we shouldn't eat any added.. I would like to track that.. there is another app that does, but I don't want to have to use two apps.. and since I paid for this once I figured they would have had that available on the app.","Hi NY, you can find goals under Settings -> Diet Goals. There is also a goal calculator that can help you determine your daily macros in grams based on the % of calories you wish to eat from each."

Two things I hope will be changed soon are the ability to edit custom foods after they have been saved and more basic foods in the search... Example,  there are many fancy options for zucchini but not just plain zucchini ... Also customizing serving sizes isn't great... Otherwise it's a nice app... I hope to change my review to five stars someday.",
6561,4,2012-03-21T15:08:47.000Z,Llhall2,Great app... Just wish...,"This is perfect for me as I don't process carbs properly and helps me keep control of them. However, I wish the food list was more extensive ie having tons of different options for zucchini but not plain zucchini. And shouldn't it have Adkins products listed?  I use the Adkins bars for my sweet tooth and have to put them all in custom. Otherwise perfect app for me",
6562,5,2013-02-14T03:02:23.000Z,SJCruz,Great app,I've been following primal blueprint also for about a year. This app is perfect for this type of eating plan. However I dislike that I have to manually enter so many foods. It would be great if there was something to simplify the process rather than having to enter so many custom foods.,
6563,5,2013-07-27T13:23:23.000Z,Carbapp,Carb app,This program seems to be very good. I believe it is prudent to have a Exercise tab that converts energy used off sets the amount of carbs Consumed. They are doing this I with counting calories I am sure you can do it with carbs also.  I will purchase this app hoping that in the future you can make that adjustment Sincerely,
6564,5,2013-11-15T16:30:52.000Z,Tennis Tami,Excellent software!!!,"In my opinion Carb Manager is the Best program out there for carb tracking.  Only issue I have is that my Weight Graph is now not working and for some reason won't record my daily weights.  But other than that glitch, I would highly recommend this program to anyone!",
6565,5,2013-12-31T03:35:45.000Z,Kim71ber,Great!,Love how easy it is. Not complicated. So glad I downloaded it because net carbs and carbs are different and I am starting Atkins. My absolute favorite feature is how easy it is to favorite a food and not have to search for it daily!!!!  This is a huge time saver which means I'm more likely to use the app and stick to the diet.,
6566,3,2015-07-30T10:35:06.000Z,StrategicAngel,Nice but still needs work...,"I like the concept of being net carb focused, but it still needs work to be great. There seems to be no way to enter previous days if you miss logging in past. Some foods are hard to find and the filtering of foods are weak. You also cant add foods. I like the interface a little but it is a little quirky. The only reason I would use over myfitness pal is the net carb counter, but mfp is a much better app.",
6567,5,2016-08-31T10:51:36.000Z,Jennijump,Best Ever,"The functionality is great. It's easy to count carbs and keep track of how many  I have left in a day.  It starts out with a goal of 30 a day and I've kept that, and I can increase it when I get to my goal weight.  I've lost 40 lbs and as long as I keep using this, I think I can keep going!",
6568,4,2017-01-17T09:30:52.000Z,grrlygrrrl,Doesn't subtract sugar alcohols from net carbs,"I like the app overall, especially compared to similar apps. It doesn't subtract sugar alcohols from net carbs, and everything I've read says that's acceptable to deduct them. So I'm having to track those separately so I can still track everything I eat, which is inconvenient. I'd love the option to be able to do so. Thank you!",

So quick and easy to use when meal planning or eating on the go.  Some of the food listing can be redundant, which is a bother.  No crashing for me. I would recommend it without hesitation.",
6571,3,2012-06-29T05:31:28.000Z,Lehuagal,Easier than Atkins app,It really is a good app to keep track of your carbs. I wish it was easier to find the foods. I also use lose it app and just love the way they have the foods and finding them. They are more calories counting and this one more carb counting if only they could use each others strong points it would be a lot easier. But the Atkins app I still can not figure out.,

The interface is easy to use, and the information is presented in a way that is easy to read and understand. Also counts calories and tracks your weight. Exactly as described and no bugs as far as I can tell.",
6573,1,2015-10-25T18:23:18.000Z,Pink AM,No customer service,I upgraded to premium because I wanted the added features which are great. I have contacted company through email with various questions and haven't heard a peep. So if you get this app including any additional upgrade beware. I want to link my Fitbit  to app; followed their directions (additional expense) doesn't work and can't get any help.,
6574,4,2016-02-05T21:45:21.000Z,Girya411,Excellent but numbers not always consistent with nutrition facts,"Once you get the hang of searching the foods and designating favorites etc, this program is a snap. It lists more carbs than the nutrition facts on food packaging and I don't know which to believe. Tried scanning the UPC on my Jack Links Beef Steak and it wouldn't pick it up.  Nevertheless a fine program and I intend to keep using it.",
6575,4,2016-07-17T15:51:22.000Z,Ealanis,Good for me,"I like this app because it's a good way for me to track my carbs. 2 things I don't like.. 1. Should sync with Apple health for free. Paying an additional $20 for it seems a bit ridiculous. Or sync to other apps would be nice too. 2. Some foods should come in single quantities. Bacon comes in quantities of 2. So if I ate one slice....??? Other than that, great app to keep you on track.",

6577,4,2016-11-16T13:00:06.000Z,Cosmo2576,User Friendly,"I've used several apps in the past, and I like how user friendly this app is. Most of my entries  I use the barcode scanner and adjust the serving size to reflect what I've eaten. In the rare occasion the scanner doesn't upload the item, I make a custom entry.  Overall I'm very pleased with the app and using it to log my daily calorie/carb intake.",
6578,5,2017-03-25T14:33:54.000Z,Ortolans,Makes it easy to stay on track,"I really like this app. I'm trying to do a low-carb program and Carb Manager makes it simple to add up my daily carbs. It remembers what I've looked at recently. Just wish the upgrade wasn't so pricy, and I'd get it, but $40 is just too much for me. Good design, well thought out.",

6584,4,2017-03-06T17:40:15.000Z,Danitag39,Great app but needs more items in food list,I really like the app but the food list needs to have more items even in the scanning bar codes. Maybe do something like fit bit and have customers take pictures of product and nutrition so it can be added.  I do love the focus on carbs and it is great for tracking.,
6585,4,2017-03-14T19:19:25.000Z,TrippingOnWords,"Love it so far, but...",Can we get a recipe system where we can enter the total of the whole recipe and then select how many servings?

Would be great to store and readily access previous selected foods or have the search engine for foods match more the exact entry; the entry for a multiple ingredient food like a custom salad or smoothie makes for a lot of redundant entries.",

6590,4,2011-05-19T02:03:24.000Z,Counting carbs,Great App,This is a great app!  I use it every day.  I can count my carbs and calories so easily.  It's not a chore any more.  There's only a couple of things I'd add and that's the ability to edit your favorite foods (currently have to delete and then re-enter) and also to have it calculate net carbs correctly when sugar alcohols are included.  Otherwise - it's wonderful!,

I have found some discrepancies though, so I just adjust the amount I ""ate"" to what I know I consumed re: net carbs. This is way better than the Atkins app. Hope to come back and up my rating to 5 stars with the next update! For $2.99 it's very nice.  Also wish it had half pound increments for weight tracking.",

The support is a joke.  Sent an email to their support and didn't not receive anything back.  Why is Apple letting a bogus company rip off its users?  So, I considered my $20 a lost and continued to use the app.  Just updated to the latest version and it wiped out all of my data.  The data is still online but it is no longer syncing with the app.  Just a piece of crap application.",

There are no options to strip things off the meal in question and the one listing that didn't mention a bun still listed a patty as having 23 Carb units. I wasted 2.99 on this when I could have bought another hamburger, :)",

I wrote customer support. The same day.  To refund the amount and take it off my app.  No word yet. It wasn't worth the 20+ dollars. Basic app works well,

Also it counts some food as having carbs when they clearly don't (salmon has carbs??) lastly you stay within your carb count and go back through the log and days later your over your carb count? Makes no sense,

Programmer didn't fully do a complete analysis of user requirements. If they had, they would know that both fiber and sugar alcohol are subtracted from total carb count. It is uber easy to track food, but I have to go back in and subtract carbs to get my true net carb count. I would advise low-carbers to look elsewhere. Don't waste the money.",

It should subtract fiber AND sugar alcohols from the total carbohydrates but it only subtracts the fiber. So any Atkins treats, which primarily use sugar alcohols to sweeten the products are not calculated correctly. It would be great if it weren't for that. Sine that was the main reason I purchased the app I was highly disappointed.",

No.",

The quarter pounder is there but so are all the carbs with no way to edit it. Pass for me.,

Can’t control or edit your own dashboard to avoid trashy clutter. Since update it’s just miserable to log food, scan barcodes, create personal recipes.

Another annoying thing I have come to notice is anyone can add food which is great except none of the nutritional information is fact-checked. One type of food can be listed thousands of times but all have varying degrees of nutritional facts which basically means you might as well add all your food yourself and research the nutritional information so you know it’s correct.","Hey there, thanks for taking the time to leave us such detailed feedback!

I guess all the functionality is still there, but finding it is a pain in the butt. It was a bad idea to change it so radically - I assume someone beta tested it, but they must have had a lot more spare time than I do.",

I tend to eat the same things fairly regularly so I can copy the meals over to different days. Love the bar code scanner and saving custom foods.

Last night I made some chicken broth & entered all the ingredients as I usually do. Then I went to create a recipe like I’ve done many times before only to find that in the update, they’ve removed the ability to create a recipe without a premium membership. This is incredibly disappointing. I’ll be looking for another app to record my macros that isn’t going to charge $39.99 a year to create my own recipes. I don’t care about the other premium benefits. Why can’t this feature grandfather into those who were already users or charge something reasonable like $2.99 for the one feature I want?",

I’ve been eating similar foods throughout and just today, my tomatoes I’ve been eating as snacks (if I’m hungry) and as a nutritious flavor booster for my daily salads just jumped from 0 carbs to 8!!! Needless to say, I’ve lost some weight but I’m sure that accounts for the no sugar intake and not because of this app at all. I trusted this app for quality and I’ve just been steamrolled in the inaccuracy of it.

Since the new version came out I've found it to be frustratingly glitchy. I can't trust my imported recipes any longer (nutrition information is way off), I can't edit my recipes successfully, and especially on my iPad, the app loads so slowly that I always get a ""you are offline"" message when I am not. I was a Weight Watchers member for years so I'm used to using a reliable app whose data I can trust, but I switched so I could start tracking macros.

7597,2,2021-02-10T23:36:26.000Z,jkmitch,I loved this until I hated it,"I don’t know what this latest update was supposed to accomplish? I lost recipes & staple foods from my food list. There used to be a pie chart that told me where I was with the 75 20 5 ratio. It was nice to see that through the day and know if I needed to adjust my next meal. Now I have to get out the calculator and do the math. It also doesn’t save Staple ingredients in the food list if I used it as an ingredient in a recipe. If I used best foods mayo in a salad then it should also be in my food list so I don’t have to rescan it every recipe. I have put so much effort and time into these saved recipes and ingredients and I feel that the folks who did this update didn’t value that for any of us. I don’t see this as easier or quicker. Previously the way different things were highlighted made them easier to find and/or see. Now I am searching around on a white screen on my phone. I would have said why fix what’s not broken? Well, now it’s broken. See if you can fix it because you had a good reputation once.",

It lags while loading and sometimes I just give up and try later.  You cannot add to my foods list with the new version, there isn’t even an option. If you change the unit of measure (cup, gram, oz) it gets confused and you have to back out and try again.  Also, whyndominneed to see my week on the daily page. Just too cluttered and small.

The look was totally redone and it does not have the same feel. My Apple Watch no longer syncs and I could not get the bar code to scan. I have used this app for 16 months. I am very disappointed that the app was totally reconfigured. It was awesome before. So no good reason to change. Off to find a new app. I don’t understand why developers are always looking for the new and improved. Most people aren’t good with change. Fixing bugs and glitches ok. Redoing the look not ok.,

The larger graphics leaves less room for where I actually enter in the information. The drop boxes and the type size of the numbers are considerably smaller . As a middle-aged woman desperately trying to lose weight this is really obnoxious having to go get reading glasses to track my carbs. It’s just one more reason to give up.,

Should they listen to their customers and bring back the previous version, I would happily rejoin, but as it is now? I want my money back.",

We've done everything that we can to make it as quick and easy as possible. All that's required to cancel is to go to Settings-Cancel Subscription.

Carb Master is FAR more advanced in its functionalities and its database!!! And much more user friendly too!!! I bought the premium after one day !

It did the job, but my boyfriend switched to this app when we went keto and I was right behind him. I absolutely LOVE this app.  My main gripe about MFP has always been that you couldn’t account for net carbs in your macros. That was what first attracted me to Carb Manager, but I have really enjoyed using the recipe features, and the scan feature is INCREDIBLY convenient. I can create a recipe for meal prep for the week, portion it out, and send it to my boyfriend for his macro tracking too. The food library isn’t as expansive as MFP of course, but adding macros or meals is super easy. This app is genius. My only request would be that you’re able to account for pounds in decimals instead of just whole numbers. Other than that, fantastic!",

7717,5,2019-01-14T01:13:18.000Z,Way of Cats,Fantastic app! Great tool for changing what you eat.,"I got this to go Keto. The free version lets you pull from their extensive database to log food, mark favorites, create custom foods, and enter recipes with # of servings. I love the scanner that reads a bar code and pops up the entry.",
7718,2,2019-01-16T03:03:10.000Z,JGL2015,Disappointed with premium,I just upgraded to the premium version for two reasons. The first is that I wanted my exercise workouts to sync to my Apple Watch and no matter what I do I cannot get them to sync. The second reason I upgraded is that when I read the information about the premium version it said that when I input information about the food I ate it would sink across my devices so I could input onto my iPad and that would show on my iPhone.  That is absolutely not the case.  For some reason although I have input my user ID and password multiple times on my iPhone and I have logged food on that device  alternate days every time I create the ID it tells me I don’t have an ID or user name but it works fine on my iPad. I am extremely disappointed to have paid 39.99 and the main features I was looking for absolutely do not work and I have no interest in keto recipes I have plenty of cookbooks already so I spent $40 for nothing. The app itself is very good with that pie chart on how much protein carbs and fat you are eating but I suspect that the calorie count is not very accurate it seems rather low.,
7719,5,2019-01-23T19:05:14.000Z,RBailey99,Best App for Tracking Macros,"I don’t usually write reviews, but recently felt compelled. Last year I used this app for several moths to track carbs while on a Keto diet. Was very pleased. I made great use of the recipes, and on premium, the ability to download online recipes into the app.",

My hubs and I ""thought"" we were doing good on keto, but not much weight loss. Started using CM and paying attention (weighing) to how much we were actually eating. Turns out, too much. Within 2 days of using CM we both lost 4-5 lbs. Highly recommend it. Would also suggest a food scale. You can get a very nice digital one on Amazon for under $20. That has also been a critical tool.",
7722,4,2018-07-18T02:41:54.000Z,KK49ergirl,Great app,Just starting using this app pretty straightforward and easy to navigate.Only reason I didn’t give it 5 Stars is some veggies and fresh proteins are difficult to calculate. It will give a blanket rating when you are looking for a fresh organic version. I live right outside of San Francisco yet a majority of the barcodes I scan won’t read. I found it’s mainly organic and fresh foods are not in the database. Still would recommend this app just needs a few tweaks,
7723,5,2018-07-20T13:48:38.000Z,day.b,Pleased,"Honestly this is the only app I’ve ever used for watching what I eat, but I love the fact that I can type in what I’m eating (even if it’s from a restaurant) and it will pop up. The bar code scanning is great too, that way if I can’t find it, or in a rush, it’s 10x easier to just take a quick picture of what I’m eating or drinking. Still trying to get used to watching my carbs because I love pasta and bread so much. I will continue to use this until I reach my weight goal. *also great you can adjust slowly down with the carbs so you’re not quitting cold turkey!",

NOT THIS ONE! Both my trainer and my doctor suggested I monitor my carbs more and stay within 100-150 daily. This app makes it so easy to do with easy input and visual graphs. Takes me seconds per meal. Even though it has lots of other extras I’m slowly getting to, they don’t get in the way of my main objective:counting carbs!",

Thought I would try the low carb idea and found this app to help. Can’t believe what has happened in the first full week. Lost 3 pounds and my blood sugar has dropped 30 points by watching my carbs. I really hope these levels sustain. Feeling great too. Amazing app!!! Also have come up with new way to catalog foods into food “groups” - edit each new entry with a 2 letter code + a dash and a space so an apple would be (Fr- apple). Fr = fruit. With a lot of foods it seems it will make it easier down the road to find things grouped by a category.,

Too much protein will convert to carbs, so I have to constantly keep that in check if I'm going to stay below 30g of carbs. I allllllmost took a star off bc it took me a second to learn to navigate it- and I got frustrated a time or two- but I'm not sure of a better way to cram in all of the things I love about this app into, well, one app. So because I love this and need this on the reg, I'll give it 5.

7732,5,2018-03-22T12:35:42.000Z,Scrabble Sue,"Not perfect, but the best I’ve found","I downloaded four carb/blood sugar tracking apps to see which might help me log in my foods and track macros (protein, fat, carbs) + net carbs, fiber, blood sugar.  Carb Manager really stood out.  “My Fitness Pal,” which a lot of low-carbers use, had a very limited food database, and doesn’t track fiber/net carbs.  “Stupid Simple” had cute icons, but almost no database.  I don’t recall the fourth, except that the interface was not a good fit.  Carb Manager has an extensive food database.  The only thing I haven’t found in it so far is orange extract.  It lets me save custom foods (like bulletproof coffee) and even recipes—so I can see how many net carbs are in one of the almond flour cookies my daughter has been experimenting with.  Since I liked the food tracking so much, I sprung for the one-year membership ($39.99) so I could add blood sugar and sleep tracking, and food minerals, as well.  It displays data in useful ways—bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts—and ties it together.  It’s not always the most intuitive to use:  I keep losing the sleep entry field (under “Lifestyle”) vs. blood sugar (“My Measurements”—aren’t I measuring sleep?).  And, if my macros look off, 8 have to double check that the right portion size of a food or ingredient registered.  But, it’s easy to edit, and in a week I’ve already brought my fasting blood sugar down 12 points and lost a pound!  Carb Manager is the tool I need to stay on track with my blood sugar health.",

The photo option identified almost everything on my plate (chicken leg, cole slaw and grape tomatoes). And they even have most restaurants included. They have delicious recipes and can even customize a meal plan in a few clicks! You can tell it to eliminate certain foods that you may be sensitive to or just don't like. It has gluten free and fodmap free versions! Love that all my Fit-Bit steps and exercises are linked. I used the free version for a few days(while I was prepping for success before I started my new low carb lifestyle) and decided to invest in the paid version because it has so much to offer.

7782,5,2017-06-09T19:42:09.000Z,Stoney1989af,Great app but PRO needs this one thing,I love that you can integrate the health app so it can take into account calories burned throughout the day. The only problem is it does nothing with this info. You can view net calories by going into nutrition and goals but I want to be able to track net calories on the nutrition wheel. Seeing I have eaten 2000 but have to remember to subtract my Calories burned is a nuisance. My fitness pal integrates this into their app and also allows you program what macros those calories will be allocated to. So if I need to eat an extra 400 calories because I worked out I can say I want a 60/35/5 split. Please add this feature.,
7783,1,2017-06-27T00:20:33.000Z,Swin330,Terrible update,This was a great app until the update on 6/27/17. Now I can not add foods to my daily intake for some reason. Worked and now it just stopped??,"Hi there, we're sorry for the problem yesterday. We had a server outage, but we're back online now!"

Now there's another fairly massive problem: since the upgrade, it seemed like suddenly I was eating an awful lot of fat. I tracked this down to the Trader Joe's shredded pepper jack that I have for breakfast. I went back to check the nutritional information in the app. The fat grams were skyhigh. So I rescanned the barcode, and the fat grams and other nutritional values were completely wrong when compared to the actual information on the package.","Hi nwnaiad, thanks for the feedback. The ounces / grams option can be found in the serving sizes dropdown. It's now available for all foods in the database. We've added lots of serving sizes, so you might need to scroll down the list. We're rapidly adding sugar alcohols, but if you find a food without one, you can set them yourself without creating a custom food by tapping the ... button and Quick Edit. We get in touch at suppor@wombatapps.com if you have any other questions."

The closest thing I can log is one square inch to get the #s I need for 2 oz! WHAT? Also much more difficult to actually maneuver around the app. UPDATED to add, newest update and it is WORSE!","Hi there, please contact us at support@wombatapps.com and we'll help you fix the issue.

Did not get the ""warning"" courtesy button, like ""are you sure you want to subscribe?"" Like you do with other apps.  Sneaky way for them to steal $40 bucks from you. That is messed up.

I really love the bar code scanner to easily scan new foods and add to my favorite. I would give it a 5 star but everything can use improvements. I'd like to see added features like adding your workout routines from a list of gym equipment or floor exercises that counted your calorie burn. I know other apps do that but I'd like to see one app that does it all. Even allow grocery list and recipes that counted calories for the day as you added each meal. Am I asking too much? Hope to see it one day but for now I'll stick with this app. Thanks,

The bar code reader doesn't recognize even common national brands let alone local ones. Trying to manually enter brands / meal choices brings no results.

There is a premium version, which I would like but it is not a flat fee.  It is $19.95 a year.  For me, personally, I'm not going to pay an annual fee.

And then I get the instruction that I have to use the Apple health app basically to go between and in order to do this I had to BUY two more apps to allow this sync.  It tells you one of them is free, but it isn't.  So I decided to try it.  If it worked it would be worth it.  There is zero difference in what I was getting for FREE!  I still have to go to the health app to get any information.  And my free food tracking app is actually putting all the same info there.  I have written and asked them to help me figure out what my advantage in paying is.  No response.  Honestly.  I want my money back. This is a waste.",

What I do not like is the fact to use it with your Health app, add friends, and track your water intake you need to pay a premium of $19.99/annually. One of the perks (for me) of having a tracker is having friends as accountability partners and cheerleaders. Without this service, it is only a mediocre app. I truly couldn't care less about the water tracking, but I think people should know. If these things were included with the purchase of the app, I'd definitely raise the ratings. I smell a new update coming out...",
