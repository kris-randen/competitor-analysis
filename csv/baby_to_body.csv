0,4,2019-01-15T17:52:19.000Z,cprado23,Edit* improved,Edit**** the developers heard our concerns the glitches have been fixed. Since it’s a new app there’s always room for improvement. Some exercises are missing equipment needed before it starts. For example there’s some workouts where I’ve needed a mat since there’s floor stretching but it didn’t have it in the equipment needed. But it do enjoy that the model doing the exercises is the same stage of pregnancy as I am to ensure the safety of the movements.,"Hi cprado23! We're so happy to hear you're enjoying the app so far - and the good news is we'll soon be making modifications to the Fitness Studio workouts to allow for more transition time! Additionally - the workouts do change as you progress through pregnancy to meet the needs of your changing body shape. They may not drastically change from one week to the next in terms of the types of moves, but as you get farther into your pregnancy you'll notice that the workouts will adjust with you. I hope this helps to know!"
1,4,2021-04-13T01:58:09.000Z,lobabill,Repetitive but good for keeping you on track,I couldn’t decide if I should give 3 or 4 stars.  Here’s what I like: the tracking feature.  You are given a set number of workouts to complete in a week (I have mine set to four because I like to run/walk in addition to using this app).  The set number of workouts to check off my list keeps me motivated.  I like the pelvic floor exercises because otherwise I’d never do them.  There are also other features like audio workouts (I suppose people use these at the gym as opposed to watching along with the video) and you can always search and do more than your recommended weekly workouts.,"Hi there, thank you so much for leaving such a thoughtful review, we greatly appreciate it. We're so happy to hear what you've enjoyed about the app and we've just released a new update that I think you'll enjoy even more as it tracks your progress throughout the week on your homepage and across all healthy living activities. We do understand your thoughts on the workouts feeling too repetitive and not advanced enough, and we work on new workouts on an ongoing basis so we'll absolutely take this into account. If you'd like to email us at support@baby2body.com we'd love to recommend some routines you might prefer more as well!"
2,3,2020-04-20T14:30:43.000Z,CoriiSuee,"Excited for this app, annoyed with loading pauses","I was so excited to find this app and have purchased the premium and been using it for a week now, but in the middle of the workouts the exercise will simply stop loading and I’m sitting waiting for it while my heart rate slows and I lose the burn. At first I figured out that if I click on the next movement it will load more quickly SOMETIMES, but mainly it just glitches more.  Another day I tried to let it “load” aka sit for 30 minutes before I even click play to begin the daily workout, but that didn’t work either. I use 5G WiFi and have no issues with slow connection in the house, I have deleted the app and re-downloaded it and re-started my phone to troubleshoot at no avail. If this one glitch would be fixed I would be happy to rate this app a 5 star! The workouts are challenging and easy to follow along, and I love being able to track my progress. I do wish I could track what I eat in the “kitchen” but I just had to download a separate app for that. I am a single mother and a lot of the recipes do not seem budget friendly, but the recipes are listed and arranged to make them so simple! I do hope to try some of them as my pregnancy progresses. All in all it is a very cool app!!",Hello! I just wanted to update you that our latest app release has resolved the above issues with the Fitness Studio videos and we would love for you to update and give it a try again : )
3,3,2020-05-26T03:10:17.000Z,Alessandra Hirai,"Repetitive exercises, not exactly designed for pregnant women","I subscribed this app as an option for a home workout during my pregnancy and quarantine period. I added my goal of exercising 4 days a week for about 30-40min. At the beginning I noticed that the videos was always crashing, so an exercise plan of 40 minutes normally takes longer as it restart the whole exercise. The plans are pretty similar, over and over, and not only there is a slim model on the videos (not a pregnant woman on an exercise app designed for pregnant women) but also a bunch of lunges for example and other exercises not really good or comfortable for 20+ weeks pregnancy. There is a huge amount of repetitive exercises during a pla. I’m 23 weeks pregnant and it has increasing the number of lunges and other extreme exercises as well as sending longer plans (47 minutes). They offer repetitive shorter options in case you wanna reduce your time, but really, same exercises all the time! I will not continue with my subscription and I’m extremely disappointed! Do not recommend!","Hi Alessandra, I'm sorry to hear you were disappointed with the app experience. If you'd like to email us at team@baby2body.com we can review your plan and make some recommendations and modifications that might better suit you! Otherwise we wish you all the best and good health going forward."
4,3,2019-02-15T16:38:49.000Z,2222344556,Good exercises but long awkward video pauses,"I downloaded the app for the workouts and really new to the app, but first impressions are.... the exercises are great, but the transitions between each exercise are awkward. While the video example is great to have, they just start way too late! There seems to be a long pause where the model isn’t doing anything, like she’s almost waiting for the voice over to explain before she starts, so by the time she shows you what to do, half the time of the exercise clock has run out. I’d recommend the model should already be in action doing the exercise routine right from the second the time starts (not 5-10 seconds in). I also think the cool down is too long (almost as long as the main session, I’d rather send more time in the main session. I’m going to keep using the app for now and see if I get use to the awkward pauses and maybe as I get further along I’ll appreciate them, but for not completely sold in this so look at other options too.","Hi there! We're so happy you're liking the app so far, and we do want you to know that you can turn off the exercise preview between exercises by going into the settings menu, in the top right corner of the Fitness Studio. We also appreciate your feedback on the stretches at the end - it is important that you cool down properly while pregnant, but we constantly review our workouts and make improvements so we'll be sure to look at those closely."
5,2,2020-05-09T11:20:39.000Z,cstell12345,Limited Variation and ability to customize,"I was excited to have an app to lead me through home workouts during pregnancy especially during quarantine. At the start (in second trimester), I was enjoying the app overall. My biggest complaint was that I didn’t feel I was getting enough cardio and there is no way (so far as I can tell) to customize the workout type (eg have more  cardio routines to select from in a given week) apart from repeating a workout. As the weeks have gone on, as other reviewers have noted, it seems the exercises are just recycled —I’m doing the same exercises I have been, perhaps just in different order, for several weeks without any new additions mixed in. In addition, the trainer in the video barely appears pregnant so in my third trimester I’m following someone that has a lot more range of mobility etc. it seems for a pregnancy dedicated app, the very least it could do would be to film instructors at about the appropriate prenatal stage...  there is a lot of room for improvement and I don’t feel I will continue with the app beyond the initial period I’ve already paid for.","Hi there, thank you so much for taking the time to leave such thoughtful feedback. We are actually getting ready to add almost 50 new workouts to the pregnancy side of the app, offering more cardio routines, and prenatal yoga, and we're constantly working with new prenatal experts to create more. We do have over 250 unique workouts now on the pregnancy side of the app, but I'm sorry to hear it didn't feel varied enough for you. You are correct that you will see that the routines will pop up again in later weeks, and we do that because it's all about maintaining consistency and not introducing your body to anything radically new as you progress through pregnancy into later trimesters. But we will take this feedback into account as we work to add even more new workouts to the app for all users! Wishing you all the best going forward and thank you for trying Baby2Body."
6,3,2020-04-03T12:51:51.000Z,lydiawwwhite,"Nice holistic start, could be more accessible and add more tracking","I am using the app primarily for workouts and pelvic floor exercises. I don’t have much at-home exercise equipment so I have to do a ton of modifications. It would be nice if there were more exercises that didn’t rely on special equipment or large exercise balls. In terms of UX, the pelvic floor exercises are buried in the overflow menu instead of accessible from home screen. And it would be nice to have more granular control over notifications.","Hi there! Thanks so much for taking the time to leave a review! We do try to make the workouts as equipment-free as possible and we always recommend easy household alternatives or suggest doing the workout without any equipment where possible. We know the exercise ball can be a cumbersome piece of equipment to have in your home and for most of those workouts we recommend sitting on a soft chair instead. For the pelvic floor exercises you can also easily access them in the More tab -- hopefully that's helpful! Lastly, we do have weight tracking available! It may be that it's hidden from your activity tracking at present. To turn that on you can tap on Edit next to the Tracking section and you should be able to turn on the weight tracker. We'll be adding more tracking features soon as well, and blood pressure monitoring is one of the new additions! We really appreciate this feedback, we'd love to hear more as well if you'd like to contact us at team@baby2body.com"
7,2,2018-08-01T15:55:42.000Z,TMammoser,Seems Unfinished...,"I, at first, fell in love with this app for the weekly circuit workouts. They were a perfect addition to walking and yoga during my pregnancy. However, there isn’t sound and they don’t include transition time in between exercises so I had to be prepared to makeup those missed reps later. Well, now in my third trimester the circuits stopped. Are they not done creating them yet? So now I’ve tried using the MyFitnessStudio portion and the workout orders are not correct. Today I did a workout that went from warm-up, to cool down, and then the workout. Do the creators not test these out before they post them? Also who creates these workouts? One had a lot of bridge exercises so I was on my back for a long time and then there was reclined twists which can be unsafe. I hope they have certified instructors creating these workouts because women are trusting you. Review your own app Baby2Body so you know you are charging women for the app you are intending to give them.","Hi TMammoser, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on the app! We wanted to follow up on the points you referenced, just to provide clarification. The weekly circuit workouts were originally built as our fitness offering - but the feedback we received was that people wanted more variety throughout the week via a customizable workout plan. Which is why we created the complete Fitness Studio! We had not yet filmed and created the third trimester circuit workouts, so that's why you don't see them anymore. However, there are now 7 unique workouts every single week in the fitness studio for all of pregnancy (including the third trimester!). Thank you for bringing the workout ordering issue to our attention - we are looking for the exact glitch and will be fixing right away - right now it looks like that just impacted one particular workout. There are over 300 different workouts on the fitness studio and I have personally tested them all - but seems as if I missed a small error - my apologies! So you know - all workouts have been created and approved as pregnancy-safe (for each trimester) by Baby2Body CEO and Founder Melinda Nicci. Melinda is a Sport Psychologist and a professional fitness trainer with specific qualification in prenatal and postnatal exercise. She's been a specialist and PT in this space for nearly 25 years!  Thank you for voicing your concerns on the safety of the exercises - and we do cover all considerations throughout the Baby2Body content experience. Just to provide further clarification on why these moves are considered safe as long as you experience no pain: the bridge exercises you see in the third trimester keep you in a lifted position and therefore not placing pressure directly on your back. Keep in mind that you can lie on your back for a period of time and do no harm to your or baby. The concern is added pressure placed on a large artery in your back, and that partially blocked blood flow can make you dizzy after a while. If this ever happens, all you need to do is roll to your left side and wait for any dizziness to pass before slowly sitting up. Bridge workouts are a great way to target your glutes and hip stabilizing muscles, without having to be in a position that requires a lot of balance during your later stages of pregnancy (which can prove difficult!) but you are also not placing that direct pressure on your back as your glutes are engaged and your abdomen is lifted. We do carefully create these workouts so that you are never on your back for an extended period of time that could cause dizziness or lightheadedness. As far as the reclined spinal twist stretch - it is supposed to be a gentle stretch that targets your gluteal (or butt) and lower back muscles. There should be no vigorous abdominal twisting (which we definitely advise against) but instead a gentle, comfortable stretch to target those hard to reach muscles.  I do hope this helps! If you have any further questions or feedback for us, please reach out to team@baby2body.com. All the best, Caitlin - VP of Content Strategy"

We are a small team and a young company so we're excited about all the things we can do going forward but we do have over 500 workouts on the app offering different intensity levels and the workouts do change to ensure you are doing routines safe for your stage. They are all created by prenatal and postnatal fitness experts and they do change over time as you progress through pregnancy. What we're working to do is to also show women that there is so much you can do with prenatal exercise and it really doesn't have to look that different from your normal routines, as long as you're aware of the modifications to make and some simple things to avoid -- but we take care of that on our end!

9,2,2018-06-30T02:31:36.000Z,草莓娜娜,App looks great... but most everything is locked until u pay,"I was really excited about this app and wanted to try it out. In my experience “in-app” purchase apps still have some functionality without purchasing. And they let you test drive parts of the locked stuff to see if you like it before giving your billing info and having to cancel later. Very disappointed in this as you can’t do much of anything on the app unless you sign up for a 7 day free trial. And everything you click on leads back to a page asking for $7/mo. Makes it seem like a money grabbing app, not one out to support moms to be and their well-being. I would recommend “what to expect” app if ur going to pay. At least they don’t seem like they’re reaching in your pocket every 10sec.",
10,3,2018-01-30T20:19:52.000Z,Laurenvieira,Don’t waste your time unless you want to purchase,"The only reason I’m giving three stars is because the app is gorgeous and I’m sure its great once you purchase it. I’m trying to save as much as possible before our baby comes and spending $7/mo on an app isn’t worth it for me, regardless of how good the app is. I thought the free version would at least have some functionality but it’s a total waste of time. All of the content is locked until you purchase. It would be great if this app had at least some features that made the free version worth keeping. I downloaded it and immediately deleted it unfortunately.","Hi Laurenvieira,"

But I feel like I have to keep the other ones so I can remember how the first few weeks went. Maybe there’s a way to do this and I haven’t seen it yet but I feel like I’ve searched all around. For example, I’d like to add my pictures from weeks 4 and 5 instead of starting at week 6.",Hi there - we're thrilled to hear you're loving the app!

It’s super important to eat healthy to FEEL good. Specially in the first trimester. Which in my opinion it’s the worst time during pregnancy because hormones can really take a toll on how you feel.

Just “I’ve conceived” and “I’ve had the baby”. Miscarriage is hard enough, would be nice to have that function so I do not have to worry about pregnancy/baby related emails while I am grieving. Given statistically at least 1 in 4 women have a miscarriage, they are hurting a huge demographic.","Hi there, and we are so sorry for your loss, our hearts go out to you at this time. We do have a report a loss feature within the app, I apologize that you weren't able to easily find that in the app. We know that miscarriage is an unfortunately real part of the motherhood journey for so many women at one point or another, so it was important to us to include this feature. We don't make it as prominent as switching from pregnancy > postpartum account, as we don't want it to be a constant reminder to all users on our app when they go into their settings menu. However, if you go to Preferences > Edit Profile you will see the report a loss button, which removes all pregnancy related content from your app and turns off emails and notifications at this sensitive time. If you would like help finding that we would be happy to help, you can always email us at support@baby2body.com. Wishing you all the best."
30,2,2019-01-06T21:07:45.000Z,RunMocha,Fitness Studio is boring,"The concept of the mixed workouts and workout plans is cool, but the execution makes them extremely boring. Warm ups are monotonous and low energy, not enough to actually warm up. Moreover, I’ve had to skip a bunch of exercises because they’re not safe for diastasis recti.",
31,1,2019-01-10T22:41:24.000Z,Cdb14061,Subscribed and wouldn’t unlock the premium.,"Seems like a great app, but I paid for the $12 a month subscription and when I tried to click on the work outs they were still locked. I continued to try to keep buying the subscription thinking maybe it wasn’t working but it kept saying I was already subscribed??  Just confused as to why I paid and nothing was unlocking, guess it could’ve been a glitch or something, but I’m not wasting my time on it.","Hi there! I believe we've gotten this sorted for you, but please email us at team@baby2body.com if you're still having issues."
32,5,2019-01-11T00:20:29.000Z,bcstu,Great app for motivation!!,"I’m really loving this app so far. I’m one week into the exercise program, and I am feeling so fantastic and proud of what I have accomplished so far. I paid for three months of the extra workout features, and I’m really glad I did. Definitely worth it. I’m enjoying the other features too like the articles and quotes. I’ll be recommending this app to my pregnant friends for sure!!",
33,5,2019-05-02T01:51:51.000Z,Geleny rojas,OMG! Amazing!,Love this app! I hesitate it for a month to actually starting paying and now I regret it! The workouts are incredible so easy and short! As a moms we don’t have much time and all of the workouts are less than 30 min and it motives you that the person showing the workouts is actually pregnant! Completely love everything on this app. Must get it!,
34,1,2019-06-01T00:09:56.000Z,Lindsey0316,Irritated with this App,"Wish I hadn’t purchased. Every time I start the Fitness portion, I get kicked out of the app when my screen goes to rest mode (goes dark) then I have to go back in and restart the fitness program I was already doing. I have to do this multiple times during the workout so I started taking screen shots of the workouts to avoid going back into the app which defeats the purpose of having the app. The app is fully updated on my end. I purchased the 3 month option which I wish I hadn’t done.  Overall annoyed with this app and would like to get my money back.","Hi there! Over the weekend Google Cloud experienced an outage that impacted a large number of applications and websites (including Youtube, Gmail, and Snapchat), and the Baby2Body app was impacted by this as well - causing trouble accessing all of our videos (therefore the Fitness Studio was largely effected). Google Cloud services have now been fully restored, so the Baby2Body app should be working as normal again. Please email us directly at team@baby2body.com if you're still having trouble and we'll be sure to get this resolved for you right away as we haven't had reports of trouble otherwise!"
35,5,2020-06-08T00:21:44.000Z,MomofTomTom,Amazing for Pregnancy and Post-Partum!,"I love always having a pregnancy-stage-appropriate workout ready to go on my phone! Now that I’m 12 weeks post-partum, this app really takes away any excuse to work out and get back into shape. While I used it primarily for the fitness aspects, the food and general wellness tidbits are also great. Highly recommend for any expecting mom, and look forward to using it fo my next pregnancy!","Hello! Thank you so much for leaving such a lovely review, we're so happy that you're loving the Baby2Body app. We also have a full postpartum experience as well that we hope you'll enjoy : ) Thank you for being part of this incredible community."
36,4,2021-05-23T18:23:22.000Z,CassHuf,TTC need ability to focus on certain areas,I enjoy using this app. I do however think you should be able to customize specific areas you’d like to focus on prior to conception. Not many abdominal workouts mostly squats and lunges. Warm ups are the same most days. I’ve been using the app consistently for over three months now. Their health information and nutrition is great enjoy getting the daily updates. I would recommend this app.,"Hello and thank you for your review! We really appreciate this feedback and we're actually launching an update later this week that will allow you to browse all workouts by focus area, so you can add more customization into your weekly workout plans as well, by being able to access all workouts suited to your stage. We'd love to hear what you think of it as soon as it's live!"
37,4,2021-07-26T11:35:11.000Z,LaurelMarie,Need time between reps,"Overall love this app. BUT. I am almost seven months pregnant and have a big belly already. If y’all wanna switch between a looped band leg exercises and exercises that don’t use the band, I’m gonna need a hot second to take that bad boy on and off. Having to constantly pause the workouts to change equipment is annoying. Would love a quick break between each rep if we’re changing equipment. We are pregnant, after all! Thank you!","We're so happy to hear you are loving the app! We absolutely understand this concern, and our newer routines do feature those structured transition times to help you switch equipment accordingly. Some of our older routines don't have these, and we will be phasing them out over time! However, we do have a feature that allows you to turn on exercise previews -- which gives you anywhere from 5-60 seconds before each new move to preview the exercise and prepare accordingly. You can always turn this on in the settings section of your Fitness Studio : )"
38,5,2021-03-06T23:20:52.000Z,gigi_gabriela,Switch plan,Hello!,Hi there! We're so happy to hear you've been enjoying the quarterly subscriptions! If you could email us at support@baby2body.com we can help out with this. : )
39,2,2020-09-10T18:25:51.000Z,Kaylinrose,Safe?,"I am 5wks along, have endometriosis, Adenomyosis and pelvic floor issues. The first thing this app wanted me to do, was pelvic floor exercises. You aren’t really inclusive for high risk pregnancies and women whom have health issues. There isn’t even a place to put this information in like there is with other pregnancy apps. Within the first 30 seconds of opening this app, it wanted me to sign up for a premium membership, I haven’t even looked over the app and you already want my credit card information? I’ll be deleting this app now.","Hi there! We can assure you that all workouts and recommendations on the Baby2Body app are built by prenatal and postnatal fitness experts according to all guidelines to ensure a safe experience, and all content is created through evidence-based research practices. We proudly include pelvic floor exercises as part of a daily recommended routine (for all women), as they are almost universally safe and critically important. With pelvic floor issues you want to be mindful of exercises that place downward pressure on your PF, but the PF exercises we have on app are designed to pull those muscles up, restoring proper health and functioning -- and in all cases our experts are aware of, these would be recommended when dealing with weakened pelvic floor muscles. We do provide information on higher-risk pregnancies and are as inclusive as possible, however we are not able to provide bespoke workout plans for certain high-risk conditions as each woman's experience is so different and in those cases we recommend you work closely with your healthcare professional to make sure you are doing what is best for you. You are of course welcome to stay on the app as a free member and enjoy all that the app has to offer, but we also respect if the Baby2Body experience isn't right for you and wish you all the best going forward."
40,2,2018-03-23T15:10:44.000Z,Miriampliego,What a disappointment,Ok first of all I would like to said that ok your app is good and all.... but most of the stuff is lock and you need to paid 7/mon is not worth to me I would pay only on time payment to unlock everything. As good as it is is my worth to me to download it if everything is going to be lock plus is not worth for me to pay that can of app ... to be honest you guys need to fix this other wise is not worth to download it mommas out there don’t waste your time with this app ... such a disappointment.,"Hi Miriampliego, we're happy you enjoyed the app though we're sorry to hear that you were not happy with the subscription pricing and structure of Premium. It's great to know that you'd be more interested in a one time payment option, and we'd love to hear more of your feedback. We'll be sending you an email shortly to discuss more options!"
41,5,2018-05-29T01:34:20.000Z,gb22765,Stopped working once I paid!,"I liked this app and paid for the monthly subscription specifically for the fitness studio feature.  A few days later, despite everything being updated, it stopped loading (rest of the app works fine).  Customer service ignored my email.","Hello gb22765,"
42,2,2018-07-11T03:26:58.000Z,Nyla327,Free Trial...will probably delete,"While enjoy this app the fitness section is lacking. Why is there no sound? Am I doing something wrong? I’ve checked all settings. How can I do a workout when I’m not sure when to move to the next move? I need a countdown, timer or something. I like the exercises but the app seems unfinished. Plus the workout girl forgets she’s supposed to keep going and she stops and starts in the middle of the move. That’s distracting. I have better apps for exercise and will continue to use those instead.","Hi Nyla327, thank you for this feedback! We are actively working on this exact issue right away. When we were creating the Fitness Studio, the user feedback we received was that sound wasn’t as much of an interest, as people expressed a greater likelihood of playing their own music over the workouts. However we definitely recognize the importance of having audio guidance - and we’ll be getting it up as soon as possible!"
43,5,2021-03-17T14:57:25.000Z,MeganMoeller,Best Pregnancy App!,"Baby2Body has been an essential tool in helping me stay healthy- mind, body (and pelvic floor) in preparation for baby! I absolutely LOVE this app and how they provide options for ability levels, tips on nutrition, and a fun way to track health goals for the duration of pregnancy (and after!) I highly recommend this app to expecting mamas for a fun and fit pregnancy experience!",We're so happy to hear you are loving that app and that it's been such a positive resource. Thank you for taking the time to leave this review!
44,5,2021-05-14T22:36:37.000Z,izzy1155,Amazing!!!,"I had a few bumbs in the road with this app to forget but it was simple mistakes made by me. I set the wrong due date, so it threw off the app and I was stuck at week 3, day one for a bit. I contacted customer service, and a team member (Alyssa) was so helpful! The app is working perfect for me now! I am so excited to try the recipes and workouts ❤️",Hi there! We’re so glad to hear Alyssa was so helpful and that Baby2Body has been such a positive experience for you. Thank you so much for taking the time to leave this review and it’s wonderful to hear how excited you are to try the recipes and workouts! We’re so happy to have you in the Baby2Body family and feel free to reach out anytime : )
45,5,2021-02-22T19:24:05.000Z,Jocey48,Enjoying this app a a lot!,I canceled my gym membership (pandemic and now expecting) to try this instead and really love it! I wake up every morning and read through the “daily bites.” The workouts are awesome and my legs were even sore (a good sore) after one of the lower body workouts. You can personalize the app a good bit and the creator is very nice! Thanks!,"Hi Jocelyn, thank you so much for taking the time to leave this review! We're so happy to hear you are loving the app and that it's been a great resource for you during your pregnancy."
46,4,2020-11-11T13:41:20.000Z,workoutmama!,Great app!,"I really like this app, but I was surprised it doesn’t stop automatically when the workout was over, which is the only reason I took one star off.  I did the stretches at the end and then it started over at the top again.  Would be nice if it lets you know when it’s over so you don’t have to keep track.  My early morning mom brain would appreciate that! 😁",Hi there and we're so happy you're enjoying the Baby2Body app! When you complete a workout it should end with a completion screen you can save and also share to celebrate! So sorry to hear the exercise was looping like that. We'd love for you to email us at team@baby2body.com so we can look forward and make sure you get to enjoy the correct experience going forward.
47,3,2020-01-08T17:34:20.000Z,*RachelAnna*,Better for premium,I really like the features on this app. I thought some recipes and scheduled workouts would be included in the free app but it’s not. I was fine with not accessing the recipes. But when I started my workout routine I was only able to use one workout out of the 4 I scheduled. I wish I would have known that before I downloaded. I also don’t like that it doesn’t sync with any other of my fitness apps-not even apple health.,"Hi Rachel, thank you for taking the time to leave this review! The free version of the app does offer access to all daily bites, tracking, timeline, pelvic floor and breathing exercises and one workout per week (which does renew every week!). Since we keep the app entirely ad-free for all users we do have to charge for the full workout plans as part of Premium. We do outline this in the app description but I apologize if it was unclear. We are working on some new integrations, so great to hear you're interested in that! We are a small team and still a young company, but we have a lot of exciting things coming to the app very soon. Thanks for trying Baby2Body and we hope you'll stay on the free version of the app!"
48,5,2020-08-19T04:31:42.000Z,Alis 🌸,Helpful !!,"I was using this app all my 9 month pregnancy and absolutely love it ! Good for little tips during the day , good following after your diet ,helpful for breathing ex. I was using only the free app but I think there is much more interesting stuff if you buy monthly .",Thank you so much for taking the time to leave this review! We're honored to have been with you throughout your pregnancy and now in your mamahood journey : ) Thank you for being a part of this incredible community
49,2,2020-11-07T11:33:13.000Z,Barclay22,Not “free for 7 days”,I JUST downloaded the app. As your going through it for the first time it makes you choose what subscription you want. I figured after 7 days it would pull it out NO! It pulled out immediately and I got the notification from my bank. When I went to cancel the subscription in hopes of getting my money back it’s not under my subscribed apps. Now I have to email and probably make a call to people in hopes I can get this canceled and get my money back.,"Hi there. We're sorry to hear about this frustration on your end. Our in-app subscriptions are actually managed by Apple as it all goes through your Apple ID. The free trial policies are set by Apple and we do not have control over them, though we do included several pop ups to make it clear you must actively cancel to avoid being charged. We'll be happy to help instruct you on how to reach out to Apple for support on this as they will need to process the refund. You can contact us at team@baby2body.com !"
50,2,2019-01-01T17:21:56.000Z,asbpeter,Only got the first week of exercises,"I started the premium fitness studio account last week and loved it! I did all my exercises and was looking forward to my new plan being delivered today for week 14. It says my new plan was sent today, but it’s still only showing me old exercises and that I’ve completed everything for the week. The “support” and “contact us” links on their website don’t work so I haven’t been able to get a hold of anyone for help regarding this issue.",Hi there! We're so sorry to hear about these troubles and we'll look into our contact links right away.

51,3,2019-01-20T12:37:41.000Z,Tiff 1011,Disappointed,I have been using this app ever since I was pregnant and still use it 6 months after. I use to like reading the quotes at the bottom of the page which is mainly one of the reasons why I kept the app and now with the new update they took the quotes part out. I was so disappointed and still am. I guess you have to pay for that.....I didn't want to delete the app but I think I'm going to have to.,"Hi Tiff! We didn't take the quotes out - they are now part of your daily bites, the bubbles you can see on the homepage. This is all still part of the free version : ) We'd love for you to email us at team@baby2body.com if you have any more questions!"
52,2,2019-01-22T23:07:14.000Z,Kailyn Spears,Can’t get the day counter off!!!,I downloaded the app and started tracking my pregnancy at about 5 weeks of pregnancy. I had a miscarriage and despite the MULTIPLE times I’ve “reported a loss” it will not stop tracking my “pregnancy.” It’s hurtful to open the app and see that I should be at 8 weeks pregnancy now and I miscarried a week ago and the app still has not registered that I’m no longer pregnant. What am I supposed to do?! Report the “birthday” of my baby? Need to work this bug out ASAP.,"Hi Kailyn, we are so sorry for your loss. The 'report a loss' button does turn off all notifications and emails, but at present, the app only works when there is a recorded due date - so there is no way for us to hide that. If you'd like to email me at team@baby2body.com I'll be happy to let you know about additional options that you might be interested in or share more about our upcoming plans for the app to address this painful, yet unfortunately real, part of pregnancy."
53,5,2019-10-25T16:36:51.000Z,Mondragon813,Great Workouts,"I love this app! It’s really saved me the hassle of trying to seek out different workouts to keep myself motivated to actually do exercise. Especially now that I’m pregnant, I OT was hard to find motivation to actually get up and go workout, but they make it easy and simple, so you don’t have an excuse to not do it.",Hello! We're so happy you found Baby2Body and that you're loving the app. This is exactly what we're here for. : )
54,5,2019-09-10T06:13:09.000Z,rubiired,Just starting out,Just starting out and I feel amazing. I love how they are starting me off slow. I feel like when I have other people try to get me to start working out they push me to hard to where I don’t wanna work out again. This is definitely the start of something good.,Hi there - we're so happy you're feeling so good after using the Baby2Body app! We'll be here for you every step of the way : )
55,5,2020-10-12T14:40:36.000Z,extrasmallburger,Love this app,"This app is fantastic for not only pregnancy safe workouts, but also workouts when you are trying to get pregnant. I’ve been using this for many months now, and I love that there are new great workouts every week. It keeps things fresh. The developer is also very responsive.

56,4,2020-03-28T16:25:11.000Z,Indy Pendent,I love this app!,"I was looking for safe and effective exercise routines now that I’m in the 2nd trimester. I use this app every day and really appreciate the at home workouts. I wish there were more recipe options (the info on the site makes it sound like there’s unlimited access to some things) and prenatal yoga added, but besides that I don’t have any complaints!","We're so happy that you found Baby2Body and that you're loving the app! We really appreciate that feedback as well -- you can see all of the recipes in app by tapping on the search bar on the homepage and selecting the Recipes tag. Right now we put together 7-10 recipes for you each week in the Kitchen, but you can access all recipes on the app directly through the Search function. We are working on some updates to make this all easier to access going forward as well! And great to know you're looking for prenatal yoga -- that's something we're hoping to get on the app in the near future too!"
57,3,2020-03-30T08:08:06.000Z,katiasand,Good exercises but the workout doesn’t progress,"The exercises look good, but the workout is frustrating and time-consuming (and not as effective) because when one exercise finishes, the next doesn’t automatically start. I’m having to go back, resume the workout, and hit play again in order to move on to the next exercise. Am I doing something wrong? I’d like to just play the whole workout.","Hi there! We'd love to look into this further for you as this definitely shouldn't be happening, the workouts should move smoothly from one to the next. If you could please email us at team@baby2body.com we will get to the bottom of this for you!"
58,2,2021-05-26T22:09:45.000Z,Krista117,I hate following videos,"I’d like this app much better if it were more reading based, or at least had options for reading instead of videos. I don’t enjoy guided workouts and find it too distracting to focus on form while trying to watch a tiny screen. I’d rather be able to download a list of exercises, have it say do 30 seconds of each with a 15 second rest between sets. I do that anyway, but I have to screenshot it and it’s a nuisance.","Hello and thank you for this feedback! We do have over 500 articles on the app that offer reading-based experiences, and our Daily Bites include a collection of 5-10 text-based tips and motivational insights that update every single day. I'm sorry to hear that didn't feel like enough! I absolutely recommend checking out our blog as well (blog.baby2body.com) if you're interested in more written information as well. I will share this feedback on interest in your workout experience being more text-based with our team. The reason we currently don't do that is it doesn't allow our fitness experts to demonstrate proper form and for the audio-guidance to indicate what to be mindful of, something that is really important in pregnancy and postpartum! But we really appreciate you taking the time to send in your feedback and we'll see how we can make this feel more inclusive."
59,1,2021-03-24T20:05:47.000Z,webber2846284629,Rip off!,"Signed up for a free trial to see what this was like but failed to cancel in time. This app is EXPENSIVE.  I will edit that having it be a one year subscription, at over $100 a year, seems predatory to me. Options for month-to-month memberships or other models for membership would be better, as a persons ability to engage with physical activity during and after pregnancy can change significantly. I am pregnant and busy and exhausted and will now have to go through the App Store maze to figure out how to get my money back.","Hi there, we're sorry to hear you missed the cancellation date for your trial, but we don't feel that's fair to culminate into a 1-star review of your app experience. Also, you can very easily contact Apple regarding a refund for any in-app subscriptions purchased through your Apple ID by going to getsupport.apple.com and we would recommend doing that right away, it should be really easy to do so! Also, in response to your addition to your review we do offer a monthly option that you can cancel month to month. Our prices are incredibly on par with other similar applications and even priced below. We understand that is not a comfortable price for everyone and wish you all the best getting in touch with Apple about a refund. You can always contact us at support.baby2body.com and we can give you more tips on how to make sure you get that refund sorted."
60,1,2018-06-20T01:04:01.000Z,Ann_renee17,Don’t download free version,I’m 6 months pregnant with my first child. I downloaded this app because I haven’t exercised at all during my pregnancy and wanted safe guided prego workouts and tips that wouldn’t hurt my baby. Every single article and workout is blocked from the free version. You might as well not even download it if you’re not going to pay for the unlimited because you can’t use ANY of the features in this app without paying. It’s sad because it seems like such a great app but I can’t afford it.,
61,5,2018-11-20T03:41:49.000Z,SaraW5590,Worth the subscription!,I’m doing my free trial now and I LOVE it! Costs way less than a gym membership and the exercises are keeping my heart rate elevated without working that hard. I’m already pretty fit so having this get my heart rate up during my first trimester is really impressive!,

However, almost all content is locked on the free version. I made my fitness plan to include 3 workouts per week, but only the first workout was unlocked. I would have to subscribe to get the rest if the workouts. As I have a new baby, I have better things to spend my money on. I have deleted this app and will go back to using 8fit for workouts.",

Too bad I had to switch away because I loved the previous version of the app but this new version is just not worth the money for me.","Hi Kelly, we're sorry to hear you didn't like the update but we didn't change any of the workouts and the most recent update actually just fixed workout download stability and now allows you to choose between streaming workouts directly or downloading for offline access. Also, the entirety of the pregnancy workout programs has routines done both by pregnant demonstraters as well as one of our prenatal fitness trainers, Laura -- who isn't pregnant but does show proper form so you can make sure you're doing the moves safely. I'd love to hear more about your experience, so if you could contact us at team@baby2body.com we would greatly appreciate it!"
66,3,2021-02-16T14:26:02.000Z,RicanLyfe,No Apple Health App Compatibility,My biggest drawback about the app is that it is not compatible with the Apple Health App. I like to keep track of my exercise progress with the health app because I use multiple apps for exercise. I have to start my workout on my Apple Watch to ensure my minutes and calories for the workouts on this app to count towards my daily goals.,"Thank you so much for this feedback!

The supportive mantras, nutritional and lifestyle tips on this app are helping me feel strong and capable as I move toward my final decision. Thank you so much during this emotional time 💗💗🙏","Hi Emily, we're so happy you found Baby2Body and that it's been such a positive support for you.

69,3,2019-06-24T08:09:00.000Z,ireallycantbebothered,Need to evolve the exercise section,"I love the concept and was really excited to download the app. However I was disappointed with the workouts. There is little guidance in terms of technique (keep your knees in, toes back etc) and it’s very stilted, making the overall experience unsatisfactory. I loved the recipe ideas. If they improve the exercise section I’ll get the premium but right now I’m looking for other alternatives.","Hi there, thanks so much for trying the Baby2Body app! We're constantly working to improve the workouts and have a lot of new workouts coming to the app in the next few weeks. We'd love to hear more of your feedback so we can continue making the best experience possible for all of our users, so we'd appreciate if you email us at team@baby2body.com!"

I got to look at my workouts a total of two times before the app stopped working. I will click on my workouts now and then the app closes. I tried deleting and redone loading, my phone is updated to the latest update and so is the app. I am very disappointed","Hello AlyssaAllison13,"

I reached out to their staff and they were extremely friendly but the issue is still happening months later. The app also seems to be calculating my pregnancy week 1 week off from all of my other apps. For some reason it is one week behind even though I entered the same due date.",

I have other children so it’s a great alternative to having to leave the comfort of home and packing everyone up!!,

It’s hard to find a good pregnancy work out app for free! Please try this app if you’re considering downloading it. So far, i dont regret it at all.",
76,4,2019-02-02T06:17:55.000Z,ama11a,Great workouts for pregnant women- just wish there were more postpartum workouts,LOVE the workouts! They’re challenging without being too strenuous for a tired third-trimester momma. My only feedback is I wish they had more workouts for the postpartum period! That’s the only thing keeping me from purchasing the lifetime subscription.,"Hi there! We're so happy you've enjoyed the app so far and great that you're looking for postpartum workouts, as we'll be adding a huge amount of exercises for the postpartum period to the app in the next few weeks. Please stay tuned! : )"
77,2,2019-09-27T01:12:06.000Z,TayMC98,Exercises not recommended for third trimester,Everything has been great except the exercises. Most of the videos are performed by a women who is clearly not pregnant or maybe barely in her first trimester. I don’t really think the developers understood what a women’s body literally cannot do in the third trimester because their stomach is so big. It’s made for some petty uncomfortable exercise. App could be five stars with actual pregnant models and exercises that moved with your pregnancy.,"Hi there! The exercises in the app are all built to be safe for the exact stage you're seeing them in, as they are all built by prenatal fitness experts. In fact, the reason the woman in some of the videos isn’t pregnant is that she’s actually one of the fitness experts we work with and those are her exercises! Her name is Laura and you can learn a bit more about her on our blog. We’ll be working with more prenatal/postnatal fitness trainers who will be demonstrating the workouts in the app — just as your own prenatal personal trainer would, as they are better able to show proper form. If you ever find the workouts too challenging you can always bump down to a lower intensity level as well. I do hope this helps to know!"
78,5,2019-09-14T17:00:15.000Z,BonnielWood,Great app!,"On my third pregnancy and wanted to make sure to keep up with all the self care that’s helpful, this app definitely covers all of it- super sweet.  Haven’t gone premium yet but thinking of buying to get the recipes, they look very nourishing and satisfying.","Hi there, we're so happy you found Baby2Body for this pregnancy and that you're loving the app so far. This is exactly why we do what we do, if you have any questions about Premium please feel free to email us at team@baby2body.com"
79,3,2020-11-25T11:51:41.000Z,Neeeeessssshhhhaaa,Curious,"Honestly I’m giving this app another shot, when I first had it back in July I did the workout and started having horrible pains which lead to a miscarriage, not honestly sure if it was the workout just noticed it happened following. I’m now pregnant again and think I’ll try to give it another shot but be careful","Hi there, we're so very sorry to hear about your loss. We are happy to have you back on Baby2Body and please don't hesitate to reach out to us at any time with questions or concerns. Safe, prenatal exercise has never been associated with miscarriage, which is why it is so important to ensure what you are doing at those early stages is safe and suitable for pregnancy and suitable for your current medical condition. Some women may be advised to avoid exercise at a certain level by their healthcare professional if the pregnancy or pre-existing conditions place them in a higher risk category. All of the workouts and routines on our app have been created by prenatal fitness experts according to all current guidelines for ensured safety, but above all we recommend that women listen to their bodies and of course follow personal medical guidance. Wishing you all the best and good health with this pregnancy and we're so honored to be a part of it with you."

82,1,2019-03-12T01:03:42.000Z,swindledmama,Evil money stealing sham app,I don’t remember ever agreeing to a paid version. I just started getting noticed it was charging me $20 occasionally. Whenever I tried to click “manage subscription” to cancel the page would go white and never load. I finally was able to cancel my subscription today after I don’t know how many tries. This app took $60+ from me and I never used it once! Click with caution.,"Hi there - we're sorry to hear you feel this way, however, the only way you can be charged for the app is by actively authorizing the upgrade to Premium using your Apple ID, giving Apple permission to bill you for the subscription plan. If you do start a free trial on the app and don't cancel within the trial period you are rolled over into the subscription plan and we make that very clear throughout the app experience. We'd be happy to talk to you further about this if you reach out to us at team@baby2body.com. You can also speak to Apple by going to reportaproblem.apple.com."

84,5,2020-08-04T21:17:19.000Z,MN Puzzler,Great tool for new moms!,I highly recommend this app for new moms! This has been a great help for me for tracking items for my OBGYN instead of resulting to paper and pencil. The guided exercises and pelvic floor exercises makes it so easy to get the time in!

85,2,2019-08-23T19:49:05.000Z,jessicaroseholmes,This is why American women are fat,This morning I decided to use the apps work out instead of my normal work out routine. Let’s just say the work out are useless. The lat pull down is actually a shoulder press and rest looks similarly ill informed. None of these work out would really help anything except get your heart rate up. The daily dose information is neat but that’s the only cool thing about this.,"Hi there -- we're sorry to hear you were disappointed with the workouts. So you know, you can adjust the intensity level if you're looking for more of a challenge by going into your settings. We've also just added over 100 new workouts to the app and are continuing to work with some incredible prenatal and postnatal trainers to develop even more workouts for the app. We'd love to hear more about your experience if you'd like to reach out to us at team@baby2body.com"

87,2,2020-02-05T02:41:57.000Z,BlondeZombieGirl,Love and hate,The few work out Iv done have been great I would love to try the other functions or even other workouts but unlike other reviews that say it’s 7$ a month (which is reasonable and why I got the app to consider the membership) it is in-fact 17$ a month. I think I will stick to the free stuff till I find an more reasonable priced app or one that is free all together.,"Hi there -- the reviews you're seeing are probably from over a year ago, as last year we did release the full Fitness Studio, Zen Den, and Kitchen as well as our new timeline and tracking features and we updated the price to reflect that entirely new offering. With the quarterly plan (purchasing 3 months at a time) it comes to about $13 a month, and if you buy the Premium Package it comes down to less than $4 a month! We'll definitely be very happy to have you stay on and enjoy the free app of course. Please email us at team@baby2body.com if you have any further questions."

We don't have an iPad optimized app at present, but that is something we're hoping to add in the future.

This also comes alongside all of our Daily Bites, Learn articles, guided pelvic floor and breathing exercises, and tracking and timeline features as part of the free experience.

We're so sorry to hear about these troubles. We haven't been experiencing many crash reports lately, but I'd love to look into this further so that you can use the app and enjoy it properly!

I’m a vegetarian and allergic to fish. Even the locked premium recipes were basically useless from what I could gather from their titles. I downloaded this solely for the nutrition portion. Very disappointed.,"Hi there! You do get at least one free featured recipe per week, but the full recipes that are part of our weekly meal plans are part of the Premium experience.

Nope, pay to play. The amount you get to do on your free version is about 5-10% of what is potentially offered. It honestly isn't even worth it to have the free trial: one exercise regime and no recipes.","Hi there - thank you for sharing your thoughts! So you know, when you do the free trial that does unlock all content so you can see what Premium is like. We do make it very clear in that app description that the app is free with a Premium upgrade, this allows us to work with top experts to create safe, effective, and stage-specific fitness and wellness programs and to offer an entirely ad-free experience for all users.

I knew there were in app purchases, I didn’t know I had to pay to use it.  Why not just be honest and charge up front?  Again it looked good & I liked the first video, I did not like the misleading of it being a “free” app.","Hi there! It sounds like you're referring to the workouts in the Fitness Studio, and full access to that is part of our Premium experience, which we outline fully in the app description. As a free member you get your first workout free every week, but you also get at least one free recipe per week, stage specific articles are free every week, you get access to all breathing exercises on the app as well as our daily guided pelvic floor exercise. On top of that you get access to all Daily Bites, our tracking features, and your Timeline. Those features are part of the free app, which is why it is listed as a free app with an optional in-app upgrade to Premium.

We're sorry to hear Premium felt too expensive at this time, if you'd like to email us at team@baby2body.com we can share more about our pricing options on our website! We keep the app an entirely ad-free experience so it's a safe, private space for every woman in our community, but that does mean we have to charge for Premium in order to keep this app going and continuing to improve our offering to support women around the world. However there is a LOT that you can access as a free member! You'll get access to all of the Daily Bites, full tracking and Timeline features, one workout per week in the Fitness studio, an additional free circuit workout suited to your pregnancy week, at least one recipe in the Kitchen, and all breathing exercises in the Zen Den. You'll also get access to our guided pelvic floor exercise as well as at least one longer article each week on a topic that's relevant to your stage. We thank you for giving Baby2Body a try and we hope you'll stay on as a free member!"
118,4,2020-02-14T14:34:02.000Z,Brightplus app user,Worth it?,"It’s great. Just only worth your money if you use it everyday. Otherwise, I think they’re charging too much for this app.","Hi there! We're so glad to hear you love the app! We wish we didn't have to charge, but since we keep the app entirely ad-free and are constantly working with new experts to bring users the best health, wellness, and fitness guidance we do have to charge for this service. Additionally, it is at a similar price to other fitness and nutrition apps, which don't personalize to pregnancy and postpartum, and much less than working with a personal trainer or nutritionist directly :) We do appreciate you taking the time to leave us a review!"
119,1,2020-03-04T01:06:21.000Z,Sew1989,Worthless Unless You Pay For It,I hate a app that is 100% set up to make you pay and is outrageously expensive for a application on your cellphone. This app fits that description. You get one workout free then anything else you need to pay for and they want a unrealistic monthly payment for the services provided.,"Hi there, we're sorry to hear you feel this way, but we do outline that this is a free app with an optional Premium upgrade. The free features include: full access to Daily Bites full of stage-specific tips, updates on baby, and healthy living motivations and quotes, pelvic floor exercises, all of our guided breathing exercises, one free recipe per week, one free workout per week in the Fitness Studio plus the weekly circuit workout in the Learn section of the Fitness Studio, and full access to all tracking features and the Timeline -- which is a lot more than the one workout you mentioned. The Premium upgrade does unlock access to all content, giving you personalized programs suited for your stage of pregnancy. Our quarterly subscription gives you access to all programs for $13 a month, which is a lot less than any gym membership and less than most other fitness apps (which aren't catered to pregnancy). Plus you get weekly meal plans for pregnancy and access to all meditations and wellbeing support. Thanks for giving Baby2Body a try and sorry to hear it wasn't for you. Wishing you all the best going forward!"

127,1,2021-03-03T13:09:15.000Z,Blue Eyes4,Not worth it!,"#1 I have pregnancy brain #2 I didn’t see anything on this app that’s worth $130, which is what I got charged after the free trial. I understand I had so many days to cancel, but I’ve never been charged so much for an app. That’s absolutely absurd. I have enough to think about and this isn’t worth it.","Hi there, we know pregnancy brain is a very real thing! Our app is $119.99 USD for a full year of access, which means it's $9.99 per month for full daily guidance on your pregnancy health and wellness, complete personalized workout plans that update every week, new recipes and meal plans every week as well as meditations and wellbeing support suited to your stage.

Stretches also feel rushed at the end of the workout,"Hi there! Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback! An important part of any prenatal fitness routine is consistency as your body is constantly changing -- but we are getting ready to add a lot of new workouts to offer more variety to the app, we do hope you'll stick around to check them out! : )"

We offer a monthly subscription for $19.99 USD which renews every month and you can cancel at any time and your access will expire at the end of your month. We also offer an annual subscription that is charged up front for $119.99 USD for access for the full year. You can also cancel at any time but you will have access for the full year as that is the annual subscription agreement. The annual offering does provide significant savings as it comes out to about $10/month (or 50% savings). I hope that helps clarify but if you have further questions please contact us at support@baby2body.com

We strive to make it as clear as possible that we offer a free app with a Premium upgrade, and to unlock all content you must upgrade to Premium. As a business,​ we chose to keep the app entirely free of ads for everyone, to keep it a personal, safe space - which is why we developed Premium content to offer unique coaching programs on a subscription basis - similar to many other apps on the market.

I have good cellular service at my gym and can connect to my other apps. Very disappointed.","Hi Kacee81, sorry to hear you're having trouble connecting at the gym! When you download the app the default setting is for it to be turned off for cellular data, meaning it would only work on wifi. This is an easy fix though!

199,1,2020-09-03T16:09:02.000Z,Lec216,Updated review: 3rd trimester,*Update as of 3rd trimester:,"Hi there, we appreciate you updating your review though we're sorry to hear about this frustration. The Push It Real Good routine is a strength workout designed to help you get ready for labor and it is built by and demonstrated by one of our prenatal fitness trainers. The routine features a lot of squats and hip strengthening movements that are done throughout the entirety of the Baby2Body program so we're surprised to hear it all felt worthless. It does have two instances of a weighted deadlift in the workout -- and the recommend modification for that is a wider stance, maintaining a straight back, and hinging at the hips only until comfortable -- which our fitness trainer does demonstrate, but I can understand how it can feel less motivating and less clear when you are seeing someone not pregnant showing the moves. We are hoping to make some updates in the future that have further guidance / tips from your coach and eventually allow you to toggle between a pregnant demonstrator and your actual fitness trainer leading the routine. If you'd like to email us at team@baby2body.com we'll be happy to share more on the modifications that might help at this time."

I have the intention of finding an app to pay for the remainder of pregnancy and postpartum.  This app is a big NO from me.  It’s incredibly slow moving and glitchy.  All the work out videos are the same movements so there isn’t a lot of variety (so why would I pay!??).  The voice that is used to describe the movements breaks-up and is so monotonous- it’s torture listening to it!  I tried to connect to Spotify to have background music playing but it plays random music that doesn’t go with the workout (it selected a Christmas song one time!!!). Also I don’t have a lot of the equipment that’s needed.  I have a yoga mat and a few lightweights- that’s it.  So it was hard to select from the very little workouts that were offered.,"Hi there! We’re sorry to hear Baby2Body wasn’t a great fit for you at this time, and appreciate you taking the time to leave us your feedback. We’d love to know more about the glitches you experienced as we don’t have any new reports of glitches or app crash reports, so you shouldn’t be experiencing any issues if you’re on the most updated version. I’m sorry you didn’t find enough variety with the workouts. We do have over 300 workouts on the app with new recommendations each week and we also just released a new feature that allows you to browse all the workouts safe for your stage (not just the ones we recommend in your plan). We do include a list of recommended equipment for workouts if you’re interested, but are not necessary for most and we do have household alternatives we can recommend if you’d like! You also have the option to connect your Spotify account to the app and this would play whatever music you had playing last or chose for the workout, not anything we preselect for you. We are always working on creating new workouts with experts and if you have any feedback on what kind of variety you’re looking for, we would love to hear your thoughts.

I can’t figure out how to access the downloaded workouts though. They spend a lot of time on warm up and cool down, which is nice, but I wish there was a way to skip through those if I’ve already warmed up before the workout. I also wish there was a “workout library” of sorts, where we could do supplemental workouts on the days when we are feeling good. I’m 26 weeks pregnant now and some days I feel fabulous and want to do two workouts. One last thing - for an app that’s specifically geared towards pregnant/postpartum women, it’s a little surprising that the “instructors” are all thin, non-pregnant people. Overall it’s not a bad app for $13 a month. Just needs a little work.","Hello! We're so happy to hear you're enjoying the app and we do have a few tips for you to help with the above! So for downloaded workouts, that just allows you to do the workouts offline without streaming delays, it doesn't store the workouts in another location on the app. It just downloads the routine to your Fitness Studio for buffer-free viewing : ) We do spend a good amount of time on warm ups and cool downs as they are especially important in prenatal workout safety, but if you're already warmed up you can skip those by tapping on the first exercise in your workout circuit and that will skip right ahead for you! We do have the Do More section for you to access supplemental workouts from your weekly plan, but we are looking to create more of a workout library in the future to help users access all routines that are safe for their specific stage. And lastly, on some of the women demonstrating the routines, you will see we do have routines demonstrated by pregnant women, and the ones who are clearly not pregnant are the prenatal and postnatal fitness experts we work with, and they are demonstrating their workouts to show proper form! Just as if you were following along with a personal trainer. But we do understand it can feel helpful to watch another pregnant women doing the moves and we will take that into consideration with future routines that we add to the app! Thank you again for your thoughtful feedback! We do hope the above helps : )"

I like the day to day variety, although some workouts (like high impact cardio or step workouts) aren’t practical due to apartment living.","Hello -- we're so happy you found the Baby2Body app and that you've been challenged by the workouts so far! Thank you so much for the feedback, we are working to find a way to improve the audio controls and we'll hope to be able to offer increased control over that soon. We'll also be releasing an update soon that should further reduce some of the small glitches in the Fitness Studio so do keep an eye out. We are a small team so we thank you so much for your patience as we work to constantly improve the app.  We hope you continue to love it!"
227,2,2020-04-23T20:07:31.000Z,jennrives246,Just ok,"I was pretty hopeful at first cause the format is really user friendly and pleasant to navigate. However the workouts and kind of blah, redundant, a little boring, and glitchy. The “previews” of the next exercise are often just of the fitness instructor standing there. Workouts freeze often, and there isn’t enough variety in the week. I liked that you could link Spotify and listen to music, but workouts are still kind of boring just doing the same exercise over and over. One user said that it seemed “unfinished” and I would agree. Not yet quite there, but has potential and hopefully with some work it will become an amazing app. However after the week free trial, it wasn’t work buying a subscription.","Hi there, thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback and we're sorry to hear you were unsatisfied with the app. We do have over 500 unique workouts on the app and since we make sure the workouts each user gets are safe for their stage every single week we build the plans in a way that allows your body to get comfortable with the routines so then you can modify over time. We are excited to make some updates and add a lot of new workouts in the next month actually, and we're always working on creating more new routines that can fit into the individual plans. Again, we do appreciate your feedback and wish you all the best and good health going forward!"
228,3,2020-02-18T13:48:49.000Z,Tsampson09,Seems good not free,"Seems like a good app, being that I am at home now 40$ a month is just feasible an actual gym membership is cheaper.","Hi there! We just wanted to clarify as Premium is actually $17.99 for a monthly subscription. The $40 is for a Quarterly Subscription -- which gives you Premium access for 3 months at a time. So that comes out to about $13 per month, which is a lot less than most gym memberships :)"
229,1,2019-12-09T05:49:58.000Z,saraa122,"Unless you buy, you get nothing.","I’m not sure who exactly is giving this app such high ratings but there’s LITERALLY nothing you can do on this app (not read most recipes or articles or do any work out) without buying the premium version, which, btw isn’t like 4.99 either, they’re asking 17.99 a month. It’s ridiculous. It seems like a cool app but it’s unfair that the only thing you get in the free version is “breathing” (literally!! That part is free) deleting now!","Hi there! We're sorry to hear you're not happy that we have a Premium upgrade, but I did want to share everything available on the free app: you get access to all Daily Bites (which include daily updates on baby's growth, two tips for your health and wellbeing every day, motivational quotes, and more). You also get full access to our Timeline feature and Healthy Activity Tracking, which includes the ability to log and track things important to you throughout pregnancy and motherhood, and then check back on your progress. You also get one free workout per week, guided pelvic floor exercises, at least 3 breathing exercises every week and on top of that at least one article specific to your stage of pregnancy. Since our Premium upgrade offers personalized workouts that update each week, weekly recipes and meal plans, and weekly meditations and wellbeing support we do have to charge in order to continue delivering this high-quality content created by Baby2Body experts -- and you will find other workout apps (not personalized to pregnancy and that only provide fitness routines) will charge a similar amount, if not more. With our quarterly plan, the price does come down to $13.99 a month and with our Premium Package, you can get all content for about $7 a month.  Our Premium experience allows us to not use any ads in-app, so everyone (even free users) have an entirely ad-free, safe space to enjoy. We're sorry to hear Baby2Body wasn't right for you but we wish you all the best and good health going forward!"

232,1,2018-10-22T10:55:42.000Z,jts0545,It’s pretty but that’s all...,"Looking for pregnancy health information and healthy workouts? Don’t even waste your time downloading this app. Treat yourself to quality free workouts on YouTube and downloading a free pregnancy information app such as Baby Center. If you try this app for free- be prepared to be disappointed. There is only one workout available unless you sign up for the free 7 day trial. The free trial( of course ) leads to automatic monthly debits unless you cancel it in time. The format and information on this app are not worth the price as far as I can tell. App designers- If you really wanted folks to try an app and determine the worth of it, you don’t make them submit their credit card information to access any of the worthwhile content.",
233,5,2019-01-06T15:32:04.000Z,AmyKmommy,Great app for Prego Mamas,"I really enjoy using this app! I’m currently in my 25th week of pregnancy and have been using it for over a week now. I love that the workouts fit the week of pregnancy I am in, so I know my baby and I are safe completing them. I also like that you can stream music in the background (I use Amazon) or use your Spotify playlist. The workouts are all less than 30 minutes, so I’m able to complete them in the morning before work and my toddler waking up. They use minimal equipment I have already in my basement, or it’s easily supplemented with something else. For example, I don’t have a step, so I used my stairs. I really haven’t worked out much this pregnancy, but I’m going all out for the third trimester thanks to this app. I wish I had downloaded this app sooner! There are also lots of helpful articles and recipes. It may be cool to have some kind of communication set up with the ladies using this app, like a way to connect with other moms using the app also in week 25. Just a thought. 😊 Thanks!",
234,5,2019-01-17T20:11:33.000Z,CayM0604,Love this App!,"So far, I am SO happy with this app. It’s exactly what I was looking for in my pregnancy to help encourage and motivate me to stay healthy and active. I opted to pay the money so I could use the fitness portion and I am not disappointed. I needed fairly easy and fast workouts that made me feel like I got a little workout with not too much intensity to make it hard on me in my third trimester AND shorter workouts since I’m busy running after my 2 year old at the same time. I’m a beginner when it comes to consistently working out and “medically” overweight for my height, so I like how simple they make it to follow along and workout in each trimester without it being too advanced to follow. I appreciated the videos portion in the fitness section and that it will link to Spotify for music to workout along to. I love all the little tips and advice and recipes. Overall- I think this is totally worth the monthly payment to add onto my yoga workouts and walking. I really enjoy it and recommend it to any of my preggo mommy friends! Thank you for this app!",
235,5,2019-03-23T17:04:22.000Z,EyRiLuLu,Awesome App,I am on week 10 when I found this app and everyday before then I had no motivation to workout and kept eating all kinds of crazy unhealthy cravings. I wasn’t fully eating good when I started the excercises but this changed my mood and gave me more energy to endure this pregnancy. I started eating healthy little at a time and used their food suggestions on this app to slowly get me back on the right track. I feel amazing and some days I’m lazy but i love the simple and short workouts. They still kick my butt and everyday I feel stronger using this app. It’s awesome.,"Hi EyRiLuLu, we're so thrilled to hear you're having such a positive experience on the app. That's what we're here for! Thank you for being a part of Baby2Body."
236,5,2019-04-13T22:37:19.000Z,KellyKell2019,Amazing is an Understatement!!,"I am currently expecting & will be a first time mom, so I was on the search for a good fitness app geared specifically towards pregnant women. I searched and searched and couldn’t seem to find an appropriate app and then I came across this gem! I completed my 1st full body blast workout today & I seriously broke a sweat!!","Hi KellyKell2019, congratulations on your pregnancy and we're so happy you found us too! Thank you so much for your kind words - we love doing what we do so you can go do all the things you want and need to do! Thank you for being a part of this community."
237,5,2019-06-27T03:48:41.000Z,Katybugluv83,Love love love it!!!,This app is great! It lets you pause when you need to and come back to where you left off or even start over again if you want. It’s reasonably priced. Love the option to link to Spotify my personal opinion I wish it connected to Pandora. The only thing that I’m noticing is that when I complete a workout it will show that I completed it directly after I do but when I open back up the app it doesn’t show that I completed it. Other than that it’s a wonderful app that works you up gradually which is great especially when your as out of shape as I am. I’m curious though if the workouts grow with you and become more intense.,"Hi there! We're so happy you're loving the app and that you found us! We really appreciate the feedback as well and will look into how we can connect other music providers as well. I'd love for you to email us at team@baby2body.com directly so we can investigate why your workout isn't showing as complete, as it definitely should. We'll also be happy to share more about how the workouts change over time with you the more you use the app!"
