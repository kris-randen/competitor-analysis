0,5,2019-03-31T00:11:38.000Z,Jei G,Great!!!,"I‚Äôve been using Lose It! for about 3 weeks now and have already lost about 6 pounds. The idea of just having to scan a barcode is super easy and it‚Äôs hard to forget to log your meal because you always gotta eat! Plus, being a student on the go all of the time and having sports makes it difficult to actually use workout apps but this app is so simple and easy to use. And, if you‚Äôre in a hurry and couldn‚Äôt log a meal the day before you can always go back and edit your past days if you left something out and it will still process the info. One thing to be careful of however is not eating. There was one time where I knew I was going out and knew I was going to be over my calories and was tempted to skip breakfast but skipping meals is not a good thing to do!!! It‚Äôs okay to be over your calorie budget a little, never feel inclined to always meet the goal. Having this app made me realize what I was putting into my body(I have the free version but it still displays macros which is super helpful.) This app combined with the app ActivityTracker is the perfect duo! Enter in the distance you walked at the end of the day from ActivityTracker on Lose It! and you‚Äôll get calories added onto your calorie budget! I DEFINITELY recommend this app as I recommend it to all of my friends and anyone I know who is looking to lose weight and I hope you become as satisfied with Lose It! as I am! :)",

Even though other popular fitness apps like ""YourExerciseBuddy"" get the limelight, Lose It! just works without all of the hype and corporate sponsorships. I actually enjoy using this because it is easy to tracks calories, macros, and meals. The food database is deep and the ability to scan barcodes is wonderfully helpful. Shared meals and recipes from other users help to fill in gaps as well. It also syncs easily with my Apple Watch and Health kit to incorporate workouts and data.",

3,5,2018-01-18T19:16:21.000Z,ebear37,WoW! I am a happy Loser! Are You?,"Best app I ever used for steady weight loss!!!... it‚Äôs very encouraging to see that even when I feel like I dropped the ball and had a bad day, as far as having eaten to much, that the app doesn‚Äôt give up on me but rather motivates me to keep going and not give up on myself! This App TRULY gives me hope and a practical game plan daily. It divides my calories up per meal (4 meals) and suggest the allotted calories it recommends.... and hey! I know this thing is just an app/calculator but if you let it it can be so much more. Lastly, this app Allows you to take pics of your food daily/each meal, scan bar codes (way easier logging on the run and jetting out the door!). It‚Äôs not crazy complicated either. I love it! Honestly, when I can afford premium I am all about it!!! It teases you a bit and gives you examples of premium App privileges but it‚Äôs not to pushy either. From what I can see, premium offers dietitian planned meal plans, recipes, GROCERY LISTS & SUGGESTIONS ON WHERE TO SHOP!!! (Yes!!!... so much easier while raising a family) Ok, so enough said! This app speaks for itself. Try it! Work It! Love it! & Lose it! P.S. if I created this App I would have called it My Body Accountant or My Personal Body Life Coach! or how about My Bestie? üòÑ (seri doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to this app) ....That is how good it is! üëçüèªüòäüçáü•ÇCheers!!!...all ya happy Losers out there üòú (lol)",

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just unoptimized or if it can‚Äôt handle it‚Äôs enormous food database, but even on the latest and greatest iPhone it becomes unresponsive for at least 5 seconds whenever I try to log a new meal. This makes it frustrating to use, and I‚Äôve found myself logging less and less because of it. I‚Äôve used this app for years (and had a steak of over two years of logging every day) and the performance has gotten worse over time. Maybe it can‚Äôt handle the number of logs past a certain point, but you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd archive off older logs to prevent this.",
7,4,2019-01-16T13:58:46.000Z,Shellycris,Great for weight loss but lately has been buggy,First off I wanna say I love this app it has really helped me lose weight by tracking and being aware of what I eat and how active I am!,
8,5,2019-09-13T01:06:30.000Z,anna10121,I never thought I‚Äôd say this about a calorie tracker but...,"This is one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever found. It‚Äôs one of the easiest to use calorie tracker apps I‚Äôve ever tried (and the only one I‚Äôve been able to stick to using!). I use the free version, and even though I can‚Äôt track my macros or water (you need premium for that), it is so easy to see what I‚Äôm really eating compared to what my goals are. For the first few days, i didnt try to limit myself at all, just ate what i would normally eat in the amounts i would normally have and saw just how much i was eating compared to what it said i should be for my goals (i was eating about an extra 400 cals a day) and then slowly lowered my calories per day to what the app suggested for my goals. It even lets you know if it finds patterns in what you‚Äôre eating that are helpful to your goals (it pointed out that on days i eat chicken, i eat fewer calories overall). It‚Äôs super user friendly, and you can either look up brands of your foods or use the barcode scanner to find them more quickly. Only issue I‚Äôve found is that sometimes it measures portions in different amounts than the box says (like I‚Äôll say I‚Äôm eating mac and cheese and it‚Äôll ask me how many grams of food instead of cups or w/e). Overall, highly recommended!",

I am especially pleased with the extensiveness of the food index, the ability to add personal recipes, and the app‚Äôs recommendations based on eating history.

You are capable of logging everything that goes in your mouth henceforth you are given calories and carbs, what could be better or easier for us. Some of us are even sedentary this gives us the capability to see Day by day as we journal our activity, maybe not at the Fitbit or the gym, our every day lives. I have sustained accountability and credibility with ourselves for everything absolutely everything that goes into this mouth. Socially you can have very very close friends that you talk to daily just as one does on Facebook but it‚Äôs all relevancy to keeping healthy yes healthy. Losing weight is just a secondary benefit which is obviously for many of us important however if we cut out the carbs alone the weight will fall off and we will lose it yes Loseit. A wonderful wonderful program, unfortunately I see it putting many nutritionist  out of business.. Love love Loseit and all it has to offer especially in the premium package, try it speaks for itself for us diabetics who need to control our quantity and our quality of our foods.

11,5,2019-02-08T19:28:44.000Z,Ccccn,Best app ever!,"My weight was stuck and I actually gained. I finally decided to really do something about my weight and couldn‚Äôt find out why I couldn‚Äôt lose any weight when I didn‚Äôt eat all that bad. This app helped me figure out where my problem areas were and that was sugar and sugary drinks. I‚Äôve now changed up my diet a bit, watched my portions w this app yet this app STILL allows me to eat what I love and enjoy my sugar on certain days/times and STILL lose the weight. So far, I‚Äôve only been on it 17 days and have lost almost 4 pounds. It helps me more plan my meals and workouts in order to get the best results so that in itself motivates me! Also want to add that when the app sends badges on the screen when I lost weight or logged another day - that motivates me to keep going! Its like I‚Äôm competing against someone and being congratulated for my weight loss, but really I‚Äôm only competing against myself and I LOVE that! I am also using the free app right now! I‚Äôll be back to update when I get to my goal in July!  I am so happy it‚Äôs working I can‚Äôt believe it. This app saved me!!! Don‚Äôt need no weight watchers or crummy fad diets. I‚Äôm still eating what I love yet being mindful and careful. And cutting back on the sugar. Thanks loseit!!!",

Simple to record your daily food intake (really large library of  generic and brand name foods, but also very quick system to ""create"" your own selections which remain in the""My Foods"" category for easy retrieval). No nonsense system only requires entering the number of calories per serving which makes using the log a snap! (You CAN enter nutritional detail if you want to.)",
14,3,2019-08-29T18:58:46.000Z,Katwomanje,Disappointing,"I‚Äôm really disappointed in this app and I would not recommend at this point in doing anything more than the free version. I liked the ease of that how there were so many different things in their food database that you could log as well as scan anything with the scan bar. It was fun doing that and seeing if I stayed within or how much below my recommended calorie levels were. HOWEVER.... I stay below and most days quite a bit below the calorie allotment I was given. Since I was not losing weight I actually changed it to lose more weight and eat less calories. Not losing anything I fluctuate up to 3 pounds either way and again eating below the new goal.. fun to track your food and calories and macronutrients but that‚Äôs about it. They come up with these ‚Äúpositive food patterns‚Äù which are really unrelated they will just say if you have coffee every day and then you lose a pound that it‚Äôs a positive pattern that when you drink coffee you consume less calories. Sometimes I have lower calories and will have butter with truffle oil popcorn. I will be near or below my calorie count for that day and I always weigh more the next day. but it will come up as a positive pattern that when I have popcorn I consume less calories! If you want to watch your habits for fun do the free version but sadly that is all I can recommend. I regret paying for the annual fee, and will not renew.",
15,5,2021-05-28T03:15:03.000Z,Eager2Prosper,In Love!,"Ok sooo, I have NEVER liked counting calories and I HAVE tried calorie tracking apps before. They were boring and not engaging enough.

16,4,2021-02-28T17:45:18.000Z,Mkatgo,Great tool for nutritional tracking,"This is my go-to app and has been for many years.  I use it daily, sometimes for weight loss, but particularly for when I need to get back on track with eating right for my health.  It definitely helps me hold myself accountable and with a wealth of preloaded foods and restaurant menu items, it is easy to input my nutritional data.",
17,5,2020-07-05T22:42:43.000Z,Lucas Murphey,11 Years of Usage,"I first downloaded this app in 2009 on my iPhone 3G. I‚Äôve used it nearly every day since. From the start it‚Äôs been the perfect, no-nonsense app for tracking calories and macronutrients. With it I have learned all about nutrition and I‚Äôve developed insights into my eating habits, strengths and weaknesses. I‚Äôve seen each feature rollout improve the app‚Äôs user experience, from viewing info for individual meals to adding future meals, creating accounts for use across multiple devices to searching a public food database, scanning barcodes for quick entry to setting goals for macros and body measurements in addition to weight and calories. I‚Äôve used it to lose, gain, and maintain my weight. My graph goes all the way back to 2011 (lost some data from that iPhone 3G before online accounts started). I use the browser application frequently when I‚Äôm on a computer, and I‚Äôve used the app for years alongside old Nike+ shoe trackers, Fitbits, bluetooth scales and now my Apple Watch. As a software engineer I even pull the data it syncs to Apple Health for use in my own web application of custom charts for myself. This app has been heavily influential on my life and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.",
18,5,2020-12-16T13:52:11.000Z,Harvey2904,All you need,"I am coming up on my one year anniversary of using this app. That‚Äôs right folks, I have logged my food intake every day for a year. I wasn‚Äôt technically overweight but I was at the very top end of healthy for my height and not feeling my best. I am now, after losing 40 pounds, at the low end of what is a healthy weight for my height (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù so the range is large). I lost the weight on an exponential curve, quickly at first and then slowing to where I sit currently. I‚Äôve tried exercise to lose weight and I almost always have eaten relatively healthy, but portion control and snacking were real problems for me. Tracking through this app helps me stay accountable, see what‚Äôs a healthy portion, plan, and stay on track. With all the hype with other weight loss programs out there, this quietly gives you all you really need. Finally, yes, I pay for the premium subscription and the price is far less than any other weight loss program out there. It also makes the program sync with my Fitbit. I never write reviews for apps but this one deserves it. Just do what it says and the results will follow. If you don‚Äôt get results, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs almost certain that the problem is in the mirror.",

With the pandemic however, I made it a goal to be more healthy. With the extra time at home, I cook a lot more and have the time to add into the app. It‚Äôs fun for me now, and compared to myfitnesspal (I had trouble sticking to it), I find this more simple, UI/UX is super clean and it really gives me insight into what I‚Äôm eating and how /when I overreat based on how many calories I‚Äôm eating at breakfast/the amount of fats/and more. I‚Äôve told all my friends to get this and I‚Äôm surprised by the diversity of the foods listed as well. My only note would be to add a feature where you can see what times you are eating Your meals because I noticed that when I ate the appropriate(according to my analysis) calories at breakfast but had my lunch at a later time I would overeat, so it would be helpful to keep track of time as well. What you don‚Äôt track doesn‚Äôt get measured and it‚Äôs slowly changing my other habits and hopefully to become more productive and work out more. It‚Äôs my favorite app!",
20,5,2017-12-18T11:01:42.000Z,Bruce5614,The right app for today‚Äôs need - Lose and maintain,"This app is awesome. I am a 61-year old male who has had weight issues my whole life. I have lost 35-lbs and for the first time I have been able to keep it off. Losing weight has never been a problem because with focus it‚Äôs easy but once you get to your goal weight it‚Äôs difficult to maintain that intensity/focus to keep the weight off. This app allows you the control to eat what you want but not over do it. It is calorie counting (back to weight loss basics) made SUPER easy. The food UPC scan feature is so easy and so many foods are already part of the data base. Many restaurant items are listed, again making recording easy.",
21,3,2018-09-08T14:52:43.000Z,Prince Zorro,Gave this a rating of 3 because....,"1) I don‚Äôt like that you have to be super specific when typing to find the food you‚Äôre looking for. You should be able to get some options after entering a few key words. 2) When editing anything where I have to scroll down to type, the app just won‚Äôt...hold it stay to where I scroll to; Like, it‚Äôll just spring back up to the top of the page. I can‚Äôt edit my profile because I get get to the bottom of the page to type. Also, 3) I don‚Äôt know that the percentages and other numbers are very accurate. For example, you can find an avocado that‚Äôll say 240cal per...I don‚Äôt know 70 grams and then another option will say 350 for 70 grams. You know? It‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhich one is the right one?!‚Äù And I know that some good have checkmarks and they have been, supposedly, reviewed for accuracy by the Loose It! people but I don‚Äôt know about those either. I paid for a year subscription but I‚Äôm not happy with that. I think it isn‚Äôt worth it to pay for this app, specially if you are doing a specific diet such as I‚Äôm doing (keto). Because even though you get some exercise video and meal ideas other are not targeted to YOU they are very general and from what I can tell by using this app for many years is that they don‚Äôt update any of that stuff.",
22,5,2019-01-19T15:41:50.000Z,SugarExorciser,"Quick, easy accountability","Have no idea how much you‚Äôre eating during the day, or why‚Äîin spite of regular exercise‚Äîyou‚Äôre not losing weight? Lose It! is a quick and easy-to-use app that simplifies calorie tracking and gives you an accurate picture of where all those empty calories are hiding in your diet. The key to success is your honesty‚Äîif you eat a few Hershey kisses, log it. If you sample a few shreds of cheese while you‚Äôre cooking, log it. If you order a venti mocha with half n half, log it accurately (by the way, that is probably all your calories for the day and you get to eat celery for dinner). For me, it‚Äôs eye-opening to know how many extra calories there are in sweeteners like honey, brown sugar, jam, ketchup, bbq sauce that do nothing to fill me up and leave me hungrier sooner. But it‚Äôs worth it to use high-protein, high fat condiments like peanut butter and real butter on your whole wheat toast or sweet potato because they leave you fuller longer. All that said, this tool will be as helpful for kicking off a healthy lifestyle as you are honest with your tracking. So be honest‚Äîdon‚Äôt freak out when you go over by 50 calories on a low exercise day. Make it up tomorrow. And happy losing!!",
23,5,2019-03-01T14:07:33.000Z,Maryahshizzayne,Bang for your buck,I don‚Äôt normally write reviews ever. However this app is LIFE CHANGING. If you want to get serious  look no further. After purchasing premium for two years I decided to take the leap and buy the lifetime membership. Here‚Äôs why: community- you make amazing friends who are all going at it with you and inspire to keep you on track. Recipes and guides for workouts at your fingertips to keep things interesting. Challenges to keep you competitive and motivated to continue habits. An easy to use interface (I prefer it over myfitnesspal) it‚Äôs highly customizable and gives me many goals to target. There is literally nothing they haven‚Äôt thought of to keep you on track. The only time I lose weight is when I stick to it and log my food. There is so many amazing features it really makes the app a step above the rest. I‚Äôve been using it (off and on admittedly I‚Äôm not perfect on my journey to health) for 3 years now and every time I focus on the app and remaining active I lose so much more comparatively. They give you all the tools you need  and wrap it up in a neat package and you step up with your motivation and time and it will truly pay off.,

The premier membership is So Worth the money I spent. It has helped me take control over my eating and other health goals. It has a great selection of foods for logging your eating and It‚Äôs accurate for the most part, but lets you adjust the nutrition facts as needed.

When I first started using it, I quickly learned how easy it was to keep track of my food intake. The app gave me a daily target...based on my weight, height, target weight, etc. Entering anything into the daily dairy is crazy easy. I especially like that the database seems to include everything from practically any restaurant. I can type (or dictate), ‚ÄúLogan‚Äôs Roadhouse Caesar salad‚Äù, and it pops up on the list. You can enter your entire meal in five seconds. After using the app for a couple of months, I was blown away by my weight loss. Keeping track..like this...makes you cognizant of what you are eating...aware. I found that I was easily staying beneath my goal. The weight dropped off..and it was effortless. Just...awareness. The App also allows you to enter Exercise. That caused me to be aware and accountable to myself. I found that I rarely missed my exercise...because I loved getting it done...so I could enter it in the App. To me...this is a breakthrough in healthy eating...weight loss (for those desiring to drop some weight), and am awareness if a healthy lifestyle. I love it.",

I‚Äôve always been overweight/obese and at my heaviest was 265lbs. After discovering exercise in high school I managed to whittle my weight down to 185lbs. However exercise is only one part of weight loss/a healthy life style. I never learned how to count calories, estimate how many calories were in food, or even how to tell how MUCH food to eat! So slowly I gained weight back until I was about 220lbs and knowing how small I had been I was very depressed. Getting this app (the free version) and actually staying true to logging calories, and I mean EVERYTHING you eat, has helped me lose 15lbs in two and a half weeks alone. I can‚Äôt wait to see how much further I can go. To be successful with this app though, you can lie to yourself. Don‚Äôt fake the numbers or omit things from your log just to make it look better, you‚Äôre the only one who suffers by doing that. Log everything and learn what it is to eat a healthy amount of food each day and you‚Äôll lose weight in no time.",

Dieting was never in the equation, until I went through a major medical crisis. During that time I gained 36 pounds in one year, and the weight just kept piling on. So, over the next 7 years my weight bloomed up by 60 pounds. I was considered healthy over all ... except my weight. I was obese!!! I tried diets, unlimited diets, and the cost of diet drinks and pills didn‚Äôt help, each one I failed at. The weight would not come off, until I found the Lose it app. I bought a scale, terrifying as that was. I tracked each and every bite that went into my mouth. I was amazed at how simple it was to lose track of calories consumed and portions, until I took control with the Lose it app. My goal is 2 pounds a week. And today I‚Äôm down 10 pounds. Yay! The best part, I do not deprive myself from eating what I want. I just track each and every bite. It‚Äôs that simple. Plus, I track my steps. The nutritional value of my food as well as carbs, fats and proteins. And, I love the scanner so I always know the portion and calories. Thank you, Lose it!!!",

But my daily charts were cluttered and hard to assess for patterns or pitfalls. This app makes it so easy to do so much more than the basic record. I can see exactly where I am at any moment and can easily change portion sizes to better reflect what I actually ate. I can see what patterns of eating work best for me ‚Äî who‚Äôda thought that drinking a beer now and then tended to reduce how much I eat? A nice graph tells me how many days before I reach my ideal weight if I continue what I‚Äôm doing‚Äî talk about great motivation! And though I think it‚Äôs kind of silly, they even give me virtual badges for my accomplishments. And the food search list is pretty darn complete, but you can just add a random caloric intake in the rare event you can‚Äôt find what you were searching for. My favorite feature is how easy it is to revise a recipe or a food item to better reflect what you ended up eating. If a recipe really ends up making three portions instead of four, it‚Äôs easy to change that‚Äî and all the fat, carb and caloric info automatically adjusts. Cool!",
35,5,2021-05-18T15:11:49.000Z,scraufie,I LOVE THIS APP!,"This is one of my favorite apps of all time, and trust me I have tried A LOT of apps! In my quest to win the battle of the bulge, this has been one of the best apps I have come across to help me manage all aspects of what I am looking to do. It is so easy to log information, to find information, and to make goals for myself that keep me motivated to keep trying. The annual fee for premium service is well worth every single penny. I also just discovered that I can also use the app to track recipes from the cookbooks that I have which is also tremendously helpful in tracking yet again. I have not found the snap it option to be especially helpful, but I do try it once in a while for the heck of it. I also use the app to email automatically to my physicians office by weekly logs which helps keep me accountable to doing the logs and keeping track of what I‚Äôm eating so that helps immensely too. However there are so many features to this app that makes it easy to help you reach your goals that I could not possibly recommend it higher!

Sound familiar?  The point is that I (like most people) am much more successful when logging and this app makes it caveman easy.  It has a surprisingly thorough database populated by many users over many years.  And it can be accessed as simply as scanning barcodes on packaging.  The displays are intuitive and pleasing; which sounds odd, but you really don‚Äôt mind poring over your results.  Deep-pressing the app icon makes it easy to access crucial functions.  My only bone to pick is with the watch app, which is buggy and lags to the point it‚Äôs useless.  I really like the functionality of it, though, and hope they will address those issues.  Easily a 5-star app with an improvement to the watch.  The $30 is a must and is absolutely worth the upgrade.  If it were my app, I would give folks a free 7 days of full functionality because it would be difficult to go back to the free version.  A front screen app to be sure, you‚Äôll be happily logging meals and losing weight in no time.",

The past two weeks I‚Äôve noticed a significant bug that makes it incredibly difficult for me to accurately track my calories. My watch is connected to the app so my workouts automatically connect, which is great. I don‚Äôt like having the calorie burn bonus because I‚Äôve found going into my previous days that it‚Äôs often less than is projected. I tried getting rid of the bonus via the watch, but it stubbornly continued to appear. I then resigned myself to deleting it each day, but no matter how many times I delete it, it returns.",
38,2,2021-01-21T23:17:43.000Z,daemundawg,Works great as a stand alone app,"But if you want to connect it to you‚Äôre Apple Health, Steps, Apple Watch it will use that information to give you bonus calories that you don‚Äôt want if you really want to loose weight.  Its great to be able to have all of your information connected but I didn‚Äôt actually start loosing any weight until I disconnected everything from it.  I kept wondering why I continued to gain.  Its because if you connect any of those apps, the Apple Health or Apple Watch or steps it automatically adds more calories to what you‚Äôre allowed each day so you end up eating more than you should.  And you can‚Äôt have them connected and just turn off that feature.  I‚Äôm not sure why, its an easy enough thing to change and you should have the choice.  Why they‚Äôve decided to make this feature without an opt out I have no idea unless it keeps you paying for their app longer since you won‚Äôt be loosing the weight very quickly if at all.  Once I turned everything off I dropped weight but I‚Äôd much rather find an app that will count what I eat and let me decide if I want the extra calories or not.  Be careful because it doesn‚Äôt really tell you this and I kept trying to figure out where all of the extra calories per day were coming from.",Sorry for the confusion here!

39,2,2020-03-29T07:27:59.000Z,Alyssa303!,Be careful!,"While this app can be very useful, it can also push you to impossible, even dangerous goals. I began using the app with a very high expectations for myself (losing 2 lbs per week to drop 24 pounds). It recommended I ONLY EAT 987 calories per day, which is dangerously low. It also said that in order to keep up a ‚Äúlightly active‚Äù activity level I needed to BURN 1,987 calories per day. That would mean I was operating at a 1,000 calorie deficit every day. The app did offer a warning that my goal ‚Äúmay be too aggressive‚Äù;however, that warning was close to the bottom of the page in small print. I worry someone desperate to lose the weight wouldn‚Äôt heed that warning and would trust the app without additional research. Please consult a doctor and do your own research before proceeding. With that being said, it was extraordinarily helpful tracking what I was eating each day, calculating macros, and breaking down nutrition facts. Overall, it did help me lose weight, but not because I stuck to its recommended calorie intake and exercise levels. Proceed with caution and listen to what your body is telling you!",
40,5,2017-10-26T17:31:31.000Z,Fromashtree,It's amazing,"I use the free version. I recommend it to all my friends and strangers who ask about losing weight. I downloaded loseit in 2013. I had visited china the previous year and weighed 270. I was embarrassed being the 'fat america' I was only 22 years old. I wanted to go back to china but I wanted to feel comfortable in my skin there. It's so easy being obese in America because it's not uncommon. Going to china was a slap in the face for me. I was worried about being hungry all the time. 1200 calorie diets didn't seem to be enough. Loseit started me at 1700 calories so I didn't starve during the day but I still lost weight. I was shocked to see how many calories I had been eating a day before I started tracking. August 2014, weighing 180 I got on a plane to china again. I went from a size 24 to 12. I got down to 155 at my lowest so far. I had my daughter last year and gained weight after my c-section from not being able to walk for a month and just being in pain six months. So I'm using loseit again to get back on track. I can't recommend it enough. It saved me.",
41,5,2018-01-06T15:18:32.000Z,Efphotog,Great tool,"I recently moved over from using MyFitnessPal, to me the UI is just not friendly. On top of that got tired of getting marketing emails, even after asking to be removed from their list on several occasions. Went ahead bit the bullet and moved to the premium subscription, figured it would entice me to stay on track. Lose-it is easy when it comes to inputting data with a pretty good database. The insights section has already helped me to see trends that have helped me adjust my daily intake of sodium, carbs and fat. It‚Äôs fairly easy to create your own recipes, hav not tried any of their recipes, but many look interesting. Integration with Apple‚Äôs  heart kit is seamless and being to get a quick look on the watch is also a plus. Had an initial issue with the new Snap-it feature, but it turned out to be user issue. Put a ticket in and they responded within a few minutes to address my question. Would recommend this app to anyone that is truly interested in keeping track of their diet, daily food intake and exercise in one easy to use app.",
42,2,2018-07-23T22:16:24.000Z,Jayenooooogain,Back to Lose It but Premium Needs Work,"I was with Lose It years ago and loved the app because it tracked my weight and allowed me to log my foods and exercises. I stopped using it cause I just stopped with my diet. Years later, I'm back with Lose It, one of my favorite apps. As a free user, it was annoying to see all these cool options but that you had to be premium, such as see how your nutrition affects you and see foods under 500 calories. You could google suggested foods but as premium, it's convenient to see them organized into under 300, 500 calories and suggested weekly meals to lose weight. The content is packed in a way I can understand it. For $2.99, it's not bad to have all the premium functions. But one thing I'm disappointed about is the nutrition, i was expecting to see something like if you eat too much sodium it raises your blood pressure, but all it's done is show me pie charts of carbs, protein and the 3rd item. It's no different from what you can view as a free user. Also lastly, everybody who's reading who made it this far, your Lose It profile is default so anyone or Facebook friends could see how much you weigh, what you're eating and how much effort you're putting in. I set mine to private and I didn't connect to Facebook.",
43,5,2019-01-15T20:43:34.000Z,ARBarbABR,Very Useful,"I wanted to revamp my eating lifestyle, and LoseIt was the main tool I used to do so. The food database wasn't amazing, but with immediate access to food history it very quickly becomes an easy process to log each day. It's also community based, so it‚Äôs getting better. It's just a really straightforward, convenient log for food and weight, and if you use it constantly, as immediately as possible, adding EVERYTHING regardless what or what size - it's on your phone, and doesn't take more time or energy than sending a text-it will help you. With long enough use you'll become more conscientious about your eating habits, and healthier as a result. I tried premium for a bit back in 2016 and while some aspects were useful you're not missing a ton without it. I know the challenges  have become premium only, which is sad since they were a fun way to get more involved with the app, but they were also a bit limited, and inessential.",
44,4,2020-02-29T13:34:55.000Z,JessyNin,Great app...,"So I have had this app on my phone for about 3 years. I have been an on and off user. Finally this year I made the decision of using this app daily. I really do love how it helps you count the calories of your day, which for me is the most important. Another major important part is that I have a workout app connected and my Iwatch integrated which are great features. So far I have been using the app for 47 days and I have lost 20 lbs. The only issue I have been having and it is very annoying, is that the app will have my watch connected but will remove it from my log screen. I emailed the helpline for this app and great I had to login online make sure my data is backed up, delete the app and reinstall it.... it was fixed.....now a few weeks later the app AGAIN replaced my watch...I followed all the steps and it‚Äôs still not appearing. I hope whatever bug this app has they fix it. It‚Äôs definitely not a motivation to pay yearly fee of $30 if the free portion doesn‚Äôt even work properly. Another thing I think needs improvement is the restaurants there are a lot of them that are not integrated.",
45,4,2020-04-28T14:45:30.000Z,Uprootedtraveler,"works well, but not worth paying for","app works very well. i went from 220ish down to 170lbs at my lowest. after a couple weeks, i paid for the yearly subscription in order to link my fit bit. initially i was really excited about the fitbit tracking. however i quickly discovered it only told me what i already knew. that i was more active on some days vs others. there really wasn‚Äôt any real world use to having the sync ability. i couldn‚Äôt eat more calories just because the my fitbit told me i had burned a few hundred extra calories that day. that being said, after using the app for over a year, i can say the app itself really makes a big difference. it makes it easy to count and keep track of calorie intake. also does a great job motivating you to stay on track. however other than removing the FLOOD of OBNOXIOUS ADS the paid version is really pointless for basic weight loss. if it were a one-time fee, i would probably purchase it. however it is not and i can only imagine the developers must be about to default on their mortgage or have loan sharks chasing them. greedy little pr**ks",
46,5,2019-10-19T18:09:08.000Z,Teller10,Weight Loss Made Simple!,"My whole family is on WW so I jumped on board. However, I quickly discovered that WW does not work for people who are whole food plant based because of their ridiculous zero point food list. Almost all fruits and veggies are on it, but so are beans, which are super high in calories! Beans and legumes are one of the healthiest things we can put in our bodies. Anyway, I started assigning points (1 per 60 calories) to beans and I started losing weight. Then I realized I was PAYING WW and having to do their job for them! I did a bunch of research and found Lose It! and it has been amazing. Two months now and so easy to use! Same bar scanner and food database tools as WW, same ability to add my own recipes (a must for WFPB people), and even does a better job of tracking weight, exercise and patterns! I love this app so much. Weight loss is about calories. Period. Counting calories used to be a pain but this app makes it so easy and even fun while helping you learn how to eat healthy for a lifetime. Two big thumbs up! Why are people paying for WW?!",
47,5,2021-05-19T01:15:47.000Z,Jenzeek,Simply amazing!,"I tried this app out of desperation. I wanted to lose 10 lbs, not feel bloated all the time, and generally just feel better. After trying Noom a few years ago with no results, I was skeptical. I found Noom to be super annoying (the ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù was a pain, I didn‚Äôt care for all the tips to shift my behavior, and I got tired of always answering questions) so I didn‚Äôt have high hopes for Lose It!",
48,5,2021-06-27T15:59:07.000Z,The Happy Wanderer,I am very impressed with this app,"I highly recommend this app. Using look and feel common to many iPhone apps, this program really does make it easy to log your calories, exercise, cholesterol, sodium, and other important items. As you log and watch what you eat, you see the results and why they happen. It reinforces a healthy lifestyle and teaches you the actual truth about bad foods and habits, all at once. I am a very busy lawyer, father of 2 and caregiver to an elder, and I have no time for this. Yet I was able to incorporate logging into my life using this program. I have never successfully done it before. The program crashed a couple of times but no data was lost and it popped right back up. I doubt it was this app that crashed as I have this happen from time to time anyway. If you want to be on a lifetime eating and exercise program rather than a freakish temporary diet, get this app and learn to love your iPhone. I am down 8 pounds in the first couple of weeks and looking forward to using this until I reach my desired weight.",

Writing down every morsel only made me feel more controlled by food. I had used LoseIt! On and off for a few years, but never lasted more that 2 weeks being consistent. In 2018, I decided to really focus on my goals for an upcoming trip. In less than 30 days I had hit my mini goal. I managed to stick to a plan through my vacation and tracked for 60 days straight. I upgraded to premium. And then promptly fell off again. The weight came right back on and I stumbled through the next two years miserable. In April 2020, under lock down, I tried again. I just hit 150 days and I am completely convinced that tracking your food is a major key to successful weight loss. Even if I get behind a day or two, I put something in for everyday and keep pushing through. I have my Fitbit Charge and scale linked in so my weight and activity are all tracked automatically. It couldn‚Äôt be easier! I am half way to my ultimate goal. Thank you, LoseIt!",

So I was extremely disappointed when the app didn‚Äôt allow you insight to all your macros etc. without going premium the way myfitnesspal does. I bit the bullet and got premium and now track my calories, steps, exercises etc with lose it and my Fitbit synced to it. I have gotten used to all the features and I do enjoy the overall calories under or over for the week report because staying true to your goal is easier to do when you see how one stupid meal can keep you from that 1lb for the week. I wish there were more customizable features however for people who do intermittent fasting, as I go between my calorie budget of like 1700 and 500 every other day. So it‚Äôd be nice to customize weeks a little better. Overall the app does its job. I like the graphs, and insights and the community challenges and badges‚ÄîI‚Äôm very competitive.

I have always known how to lose weight (burn more calories than you eat, eat correct portions, exercise, etc), but was never too motivated. After joining a weight loss group through my doctor's office (not WW), I was finally motivated enough to take this seriously and stop making excuses. This app allows you to see what you actually consume in calories throughout the day-scary insight. There are some things I wish I could do more easily with the app, but that is me being lazy and you can't be lazy if you really want to lose the weight. I am where I should be right now with my weight goal, but am going to try to lose 5 pounds more. It keeps me honest and mindful of what I am doing. You must be mindful! Every piece of food you eat has a calorie (or many), so if you cheat logging your info, you are only cheating yourself! Give this app a try, it is fun. It is motivating. It is helpful.

I feel less insecure, everyday tasks are easier, and lemme tell you that this is a great way to maintain weight loss habits. You can eat almost anything you want (mind the calories however) without feeling stressed. All you need to do is plan your meals ahead of time.

65,4,2019-04-13T01:19:23.000Z,Starblacksun,Almost perfect!,"I had a Fitbit charge 2 along with the app and I originally thought it was the best and most simple tool and app in the weight and nutrition monitoring business.  But then I noticed the algorithms sucked when you tried to search for foods to log. So I got an Apple 4 watch and I loved it.  But I had to find a food log app that also adjusted outputted calories based on the watch.  I tried a bunch of apps and found that the ‚ÄúLose it‚Äù app was the best because it transferred exercise and active calories.  The only problem is the food segment.  I scanned a popular rice and it had the carbohydrates wrong.  I had to search and found the right nutrition facts but they need to fix that.  Also when I search for foods, the results are all over the place for specific labels and brands.  So often I have to Google to see which result is the most accurate or I have to go to the food‚Äôs website.  So good app but getting your calorie intake can be a pain.  Also many results list the correct calories but then have ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù in every food category like the carbs and protein.",
66,5,2021-05-08T15:05:25.000Z,MareMorgan,Versatile and robust‚Äîbets app for tracking,"I used Lose It daily and it helped me to get back into shape and lose a few pounds before my wedding. But beyond losing weight, it helped me to be healthier. I use the barcode scan but I LOVE that you can add your own recipes. The nutrition break down is the best‚Äîit‚Äôs simple and straightforward. You can see if you‚Äôre not consuming enough protein (I was not) or too much sugar, etc. I‚Äôve worn a Fitbit for years and tracked food w Lose It separately for a while. Then I decided to try tracking food through Fitbit (I was no longer trying to lose weight and liked the idea of having everything in one place). The Fitbit app for food/nutrition leaves a lot to be desired. Lose It is so much more flexible, robust, and accurate. I actually learned from Lose It. After taking a break form LI to use only Fitbit for a year, I just rejoined. My recipes are all still here and I‚Äôm thrilled. I feel Lose It just helped me be healthier and make better choices. I also just love the app‚Äôs interface.",

My goal is 178 pounds which puts my BMI in the healthy range‚Ä¶ So I‚Äôve still got some work to do but this app is helping along with getting outside and walking 2 to 3 miles most every day‚Ä¶ I feel so much better!",

This app is the only one with a really great user interface and that actually has ETHNIC FOODS in the database, which is huge for me since I enjoy a lot of non-American cuisine. I‚Äôve had the app for about a year (and sprung for the premium a few months in) and love how easily I can track my food, monitor my macros, and create and share recipes with my fianc√©e, who also uses the app. I also connected my Apple Health and Fitbit apps so my steps and workouts are captured in Lose It! and are factored into my overall calorie budget. The only reason I‚Äôm not giving the app 5 stars is because it doesn‚Äôt allow you to enter a food‚Äôs sugar alcohol content, which is important to accurately capture net carbs. I‚Äôve been keto for the past few months and this feature would be tremendously helpful. It would also be nice to have more personalization options and  articles/recipes for specific diet types, such as keto. Otherwise, this app is amazing and worth the upgrade!",

I‚Äôm not a bot here trying to tell you that this product is the one to help you loose weight. This app won‚Äôt do the work for you, but it will set you up for success as well as something could for weight loss. You get so many great recipes, the food is very easy to log. It‚Äôs actually kinda hard to log food at restaurants so it helps keep me from eating out a lot. This thing also tracks more than calories, it‚Äôs important your eating the right balance of carbs, fats, and proteins. As well as making sure you are watching how much sugar you intake. What I did is I went to reliable websites and looked up how much of each of those my body should intake. After that I set them in the app as my maximum. Ever since then I‚Äôve been burning 2 lbs a week for almost a year. Best app buy I‚Äôve ever payed for if you are committed to loosing weight... this is your time.",

It also helps me understand how many calories I need to burn before going out to dinner!!  Lost 20 lbs using this app. But I keep using it to help maintain and knock off the weight that can creep back on. Love the app!! Happy to now have the barcode scanner as well. I'm addicted. I've been using it for nearly 6 years. If I can't find my phone to enter my food items, I get stressed. It's part of my routine. It keeps me straight. I'm not always eating well. But at least I know it and can get back on track. I was amazed at how many calories some foods have. I recommend it to all my friends who want to lose weight. I like the new trends feature as well and the advice on what foods to eat. Great app!!",
73,4,2018-04-14T23:32:13.000Z,Kellee T.,Long time user,"I love this app and have used it off and on for the past 3 years. It not only helps with weight loss, but helps keep me on track just knowing I‚Äôm going to have to ‚Äúwrite down‚Äù everything I‚Äôm eating and seeing how bad it might be. They have added A LOT of foods and exercises to the list and made it easier to log everything. My only complaint is that inputting exercises can be a little too complicated. If you go for a walk it has tabs to input either time or distance and since I might walk from place to place during the day and it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint a specific time, I prefer to put in the distance ive walked, since it‚Äôs tracked on my phone. But it won‚Äôt add the distance‚Äôs calories unless I put the time in and when I put an estimated amount of time in it puts way more calories than I know I‚Äôve burned. Like it‚Äôs adding it together as 2 separate units. Also when it communicated with my apple health app, it will record my steps and distance but still won‚Äôt translate it into burned calories which defeats the purpose.",
74,5,2018-08-13T10:54:55.000Z,Jack'sMommy4158,Week one down,"I stepped on the scale a week ago and could have cried with how much weight I had gained since leaving my profession as a Correctional Officer.  I hit a low point in my life in April 2018 and turned to food as a comfort.  I gained a stupid amount of weight in a very short period of time. One year ago I was avid about eating healthy and working out.  I was very disappointed with myself and how I had let myself go. I got the app August 5,2018.  I‚Äôve only had this app a week and have went from 182 down to 175.6.  I‚Äôm using the free version.  It is extremely helpful in tracking calories and the data base of food it has on it is amazing.  I love that I can scan the barcode of what I‚Äôm eating and it comes right up! I have been doing this with very very little exercise. Some days I don‚Äôt exercise at all and I‚Äôm lucky to get 1 mile of walking in every day.  My body does feel drained from the sudden switch to lower calories and carbs, but that is to be expected. I love this app!",
75,5,2020-01-14T02:18:48.000Z,ryker758896$,Awesome,"I love this app! Every time I‚Äôve gained some weight I‚Äôve turned to this app. The best part of using this app is just that it makes me aware of what I‚Äôm eating. I can look back over my food log and I realize just how much junk food and snacking I‚Äôve been doing. You‚Äôre not going to find the *exact* calories of what you‚Äôre eating but for me, it‚Äôs about what you‚Äôre eating. I love how when it comes to exercise, specially with running, the app lets me manual enter the calories I burned. My treadmill tells the amount of calories and it‚Äôs so much easier just putting in the number it gives me to the app. The only thing that I would suggest change wise, is when it comes to exercises like sit-ups, push ups, or crunches that the app should let you put in the amount you did versus how long you took to do the activity. I can take a lot of breaks in between sets but I know how many I did. How many sit-ups I do in a minute can be vastly different than how many another person can do.",
76,2,2020-07-20T16:40:08.000Z,TheExplosiveOrange,A seriously messed up app,"Was a really good app, although the constant ads pushing me to get premium where annoying, I was using this app for a little bit. I liked it, but the goals are really uneven and some calorie intakes are too low for anyone that isn‚Äôt morbidly obese! When I set the app for fast weight loss and little to no activity, it said that around 765 calories was the recommended intake. That is way to low for anyone. But that‚Äôs just a small thing, the real thing that I‚Äôm annoyed with is how many phony or weird foods come up even when you type something as simple as egg a result shows up with 1 calorie! This is rampant on this app and it makes eating exotic or relatively unknown foods a pain! Not to mention when you try they're premium it‚Äôs just unlocking basic things that a weight loss app should have! As a person who loves to indulge in exotic spices and foods this app really doesn‚Äôt fit for me. In my honest opinion if you want a good weight loss app for a way better result try Lifesum, has all the exotic food and spices one could want, even a camera option just in case you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in your food! This isn‚Äôt a promotion this is genuine.",
77,2,2020-03-11T19:30:08.000Z,Laneybelle,Very Helpful App,"This app was recommended to me by my doctor, a physician at Mayo Clinic, who had used it himself to lose weight,   For several years I had lost, gained, and lost the same 30 pounds.  Using LoseIt for the last six months, I've lost 50 pounds and am very confident it will stay off this time because I will continue to track with LoseIt - it is so easy to use!

I ate a brand of yogurt today and it had the brand and the type of yogurt it was. It is unbelievable how helpful it is! It helps you get where you want to and makes it sorta fun along the way. Losing 2 pounds gives you a message that says ‚Äúyou lost the weight of a pineapple! Keep going!‚Äù If that‚Äôs not fun or encouraging for a food app idk what is. I can‚Äôt even really explain how happy I am with this app! It also lists, again, almost every single workout you can do, and on average how much calories people lose from it.

79,5,2019-06-15T06:05:58.000Z,Hailey1134,Great would recommend!!! but could be better,"So, I haven‚Äôt been using this app for log but I have already lost 6 almost 7 pounds. It is great for calorie management but, you have to pay to get premium. I don‚Äôt like apps that you have to pay to get stuff. If you pay you can manage protein, carbohydrates, water intake and some more things. If you don‚Äôt have premium then you can only count calories, weight and exercise but I still like the app. Another thing is that some foods are hard to find. Also I wish they would have local restaurants foods to log not just chain restaurant foods. Some of the foods that you can log are very specific too. Also they don‚Äôt have some common exercises to log. A good thing about it is you can make an exercise with the amount of calories burned if it is not there. Also you can put in a food with how many calories is in it if it is not there. But overall, I would recommend this app to anyone wanting to loose weight.",
80,5,2017-10-30T12:03:40.000Z,NickNick123411,Great weight loss app!  For Macros not so much,"I purchased the premium.  This is a great weight loss tool if you just want to reduce your calories and fat to loose weight and it has great tools for recipes and exercise.  I highly recommend this app if you are going on a reduced calorie low fat diet!! For those of us watching our macros it can get a little frustrating having to leave the food log and then go into the goals to see where you are every meal on your fat, carb and protein ratio.  It does allow you to enter your own macro ratio but it does not have a macro calculator in app.  You can use the free macro calculators on the internet, calculate your macros then come back in the app and add your own.  I have saved mine in goals but every few days it resets and I have to re enter.  So this is a great food log and calorie monitoring app, the food entries are vast and it has great tools!!  I just wish it would be easier to custom fit to the lifestyle you chose to lose weight.",
81,5,2017-12-24T13:56:27.000Z,Jiggy58,Good but with a little work could be great,"This has helped me out on a solid weight lose plan.  There are several things the app could do better.  75% of the time it doesn‚Äôt pick the restaurant via your eating at via GPS so have to enter your location.  That part isn‚Äôt so bad, when you get to the list, it should be clear which ones are information provided by the company and which ones are some people have added.  Then for each item, you need to go through the same routine, suggestion - once your at the restaurant, each time it should default to that restaurant for each food item.  Also, if you select the wrong food item, because again you can‚Äôt tell which is the real restaurant or an added one, you have to start all over.  The program should also be more intuitive.  There are foods that just go together, the lookup should have them on top.  It‚Äôs a good start but could make a few improvements to be GREAT.",
82,4,2019-08-13T21:10:43.000Z,Pennybink,Years on & off using,"But still when I do a Group Search, it brings up several choices. But once you go to view the group to see if you want to join or not...one would think going BACK would show all the groups from your ONE search. But it goes all the way back as if you want to do a new search and you have to redo the same search to view the next group you want to view. When its several you want to check out, it gets tiresome, not user friendly at all though everything else is user friendly. People need to realize if they think calories, etc info is wrong...they can custom make their own info. Means maybe some research and homework for them. But once info is in...its exactly as they want. There is a lot of sharing such info and human error can happen. The scan is great but not all items can bring up the info with scanning. I just hope eventually hitting BACK takes me back ONE PLACE and not TWO places once I back out of viewing a group to see what members are saying and such.",

It syncs with apple watch and Fitbit (I‚Äôve used it for both). The app makes tracking easy. You can add custom recipes for homemade foods (tip: works even better if you have a scale to weigh ingredients as you cook). The app has an excellent built-in database with thousands of foods ranging from fresh fruits & veggies, to snacks and fast food menu items. You can even take pictures of barcodes of many foods to instantly populate the nutrition info. If you‚Äôre new to tracking, this app can be eye opening. It allows you to see just how many calories you eat and where they come from. This app is like a budget for your body.

A couple weeks in, I haven‚Äôt experienced any glitches Or issues. I‚Äôve lost a few pounds, though my goal with the app was just to be more mindful with my eating, particularly during the pandemic.

Information on calories and nutrients are available on most every entry. My only real complaints about this app are twofold: 1.) The app is very intricate and involved, which can be a plus if you know where everything is and you want to tweak this or that. If there is a help or training site for this app I have not found it and it has been about 10 days of frustration trying to figure out where everything is. I have finally mostly done so but it is not a recommendation for this app. 2.) Many of the entries in the database are, ‚Äúper serving‚Äú. This is fine if you are eating at a restaurant, but can be very frustrating if you are fixing your own meals at home. For example, is the serving size of a tablespoon, a ladle full, or just ‚Äúdump the whole pot on your plate‚Äù?

It really does make you accountable in that if you are faithful about logging and really want to hit your goals, this tool lets you see your running calorie intake, which adds up more quickly than most of us realize! But it goes beyond calorie counting, and lets you see your nutrient balance for several items (fat, protein, carbs, etc.).

Adding your own recipes and foods is a great feature that I regularly use. I‚Äôve already lost 10 pounds since the start of the year. However, I have trouble getting it to sync with my Apple Health app. I like to keep all my data in one place, so it‚Äôs a great feature, but its troubleshooting problems with syncing is basically ‚Äúare you sure all the right permissions are turned on and the software is updated?‚Äù Yes, the answer is always yes, and I still have a warning sign and can‚Äôt get my nutrition data. Would really like to see this feature stabilized. My partner syncs with FitBit and doesn‚Äôt have any issues other than thinking the walking bonus is too generous.",

But I decided recently to get back into it. I am very saddened to see that this app has decided to take away previously free features. I don‚Äôt use a Fitbit anymore, but I don‚Äôt understand why that‚Äôs now a premium feature. What really bothers me though is that I can no longer enter any planned meals for future days. I make my lunches the night before, and it was great to be able to put the data in immediately. Now, I can‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôm not paying for that ‚Äúpremium‚Äù feature when I was able to use it freely before. I have no interest in the other premium features therefore it‚Äôs simply not worth the money to me. I try to tell myself I understand that a company wants to make money, but come on. That was never a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù feature before. It‚Äôs crap that it is now. Bad move, LoseIt.

106,2,2019-01-21T22:18:42.000Z,Kjel Sta,Could be better,"I began using Lose It after my fitness pal app kept saying its server was down and wasn‚Äôt loading. I do love that lose it recommends the amount of calories to eat per day, but otherwise, you get more with my fitness pal without paying for premium. Further, their scan database is significantly smaller than the other app - mfp only once said it couldn‚Äôt recognize a barcode, and the lose it app gave me that message 5 times this week - with items from Kroger, so pretty common stuff. Further, if you weigh food Lose It doesn‚Äôt allow you to enter decimals, only fractions - a minor annoyance if you‚Äôre in a hurry and have to convert instead of entering in the number from the scale. On that same note, mfp allows you to enter in the weight on almost every food item, and Lose It is based on the much less accurate measuring cups/spoons, and it can take awhile to find a food item in their database with the weight, so again not as accurate and frustrating if you‚Äôre in the habit of weighing - plus being fast is key and this is not fast. Disappointed for sure.",

As an example, at times I feel hungry but have eaten the same amount of calories as the day prior, I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs because I ate low amounts of protein or fiber. It has allowed me to overall balance my diet and weight. I have lost 16lbs now, about a pound a week, which I am very happy with. I was 162lbs when I started, my goal weight is 135lb. I love how the allotted calories per meal adjusts based on what I‚Äôve eaten so far that day. Once I meet my goal weight I am going to continue to track my weight as well because it does allow you to adjust your goal to ‚Äòmaintain your current weight.‚Äô I‚Äôve never successfully lost weight before and the accountability that this app makes me have is life changing.

However my complaint is that there is a great number of inaccuracies in the data base.  While the caloric information is generally correct, the other nutrients can be way off.  I know enough about the items I use to have an idea on what they should be. I then have to go on-line and search out the correct information from sites that I am aware of. There are also times when the caloric information does not match the food labels.  I end up looking things up on line.  I then have to create a custom food to have the correct data.  I wrote support with this problem and received an unhelpful reply.  The developers need to allow a user to edit food information unless the author of that item has checked off not to allow editing.  This would help ensure that users are getting the correct information. Correct the problem and the app gets 5 stars",

Then, I decided to try out MyFitness Pal because I had a friend using it. I was very disappointed! How can you lose weight when you get more of an estimated amount of calories you‚Äôve eaten in a day. Who knows if you‚Äôre eating a small, medium or large banana, etc.",

Aguirre,Loving this app,"To be totally honest I have always hated anything to do with counting calories as a way to lose weight because of how complicated it is to keep track and to how exactly how many calories in each food much less an entire meal. This app has changed my mind completely. It is so easy and fun to use . I totally love the barcode scanner which makes it super easy to use and you can even put in your own recipes add the foods you are using and it gives you a calorie count you can even take pictures. This has helped me keep track of all the foods I‚Äôm consuming and make better choices. I recommend this app to everyone trying to lose weight and even maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle. I will continue to use it because to me it‚Äôs fun and I take it as a personal challenge to stay within my daily calories. Very simple, easy to navigate, and makes losing weight FUN.",

Also, I do have widely fluctuating emotional states so in those states I will stop using this and eat for comfort and gain between 10 and 20 lbs but in just a couple months be back to a healthy weight with this app. I do wish I could just eat healthy all the time and have no problem with exercising regularly but for those of us just not blessed in that way this really helps.

I‚Äôve tried other apps, like LifeSum, and they just don‚Äôt measure up. Lose It is packed full of functionality, and its core feature set works the better than any other food tracker I‚Äôve tested. The database has both verified and user submitted foods, which means almost anything I could want to log is available. The app is smart about suggesting previous meals, which means that I rarely even need to search for the food to log; it‚Äôs already a suggestion. The app is full of little smart UX ideas like this that make it easier to use than competitor apps. My only real wish is that the design could be improved a bit, because it looks a bit dated to me. The icon was recently updated and looks much better though, so I‚Äôm hopeful that the team is working on more great changes. Keep up the good work!",

I was following the plan of losing 2 pounds of week and a while goes by of me following the plan (again not perfectly) and this week I get a notification after updating my weight I‚Äôve lost the weight of a normal sized corgi (roughly 26 pounds I think it said) lol. So I‚Äôve lost about 27 pounds by following this app with no money invested. I would highly recommend this app it has helped me a lot with loosing weight. I took some before and after pictures and when I see the difference and that much more motivation to keep going and not to mention a confidence booster. So I rate this app 5 stars with no money invested. I‚Äôm sure the paid version has a lot tools at your disposal but not necessarily to get results!,

This made it so easy and was very eye opening to the amount of calories I was consuming at times. I got tired of endless dieting. I think I‚Äôve been dieting for 20 years straight. I decided to quit dieting and attempt to eat healthy while watching my calorie intake. I‚Äôm actually eating good food while eating healthy and losing weight. As of this morning I‚Äôm down 35 lbs and just finished logging my 100th day!  If I know I have an occasion coming up, or want to eat something higher in calories, I just plan ahead and allow for the calories. My only complaint with the app is that some of the food items that are listed as verified are wrong or are incomplete on the nutritional data. Very user friendly. A couple times I‚Äôve thought, I wish the app would do this or that. After a little research I found out it actually already does. Great app.",

I found trying to keep track of calories to be a pain in the neck, and not very accurate.  I wondered of there was an app to help.  Apple had Lose It listed prominently, so I got the free app.  It made keeping track of calories and my weight SO much more efficient.  It took me about a year, but I was able to drop 80 lbs. by using this app to keep me on track.  I have recommended it to MANY people (usually the one‚Äôs who ask how I lost all that weight), and I would recommend it to you if your thinking about it.  One thing you need to do is get a food scale if you don‚Äôt have one already.  There are some that connect via Bluetooth to make recording easier (I had to manually input everything since my older food/postal scale didn‚Äôt have that feature).  Also, don‚Äôt buy the junk!

I also love the ""verified"" food calories with a little green check mark! I love that I can set goals, specifically for how many grams of each macronutrient I want and/or percentages for each. I would really love to be able to set a goal for how many servings of fruits and vegetables I want to eat per day! I would also really like to see categories that track caffeine intake based on foods I log.

I carb cycle so I change my protein, fat, carb intake & calories daily. I go by grams & not % and this app isn‚Äôt the most helpful for that. Yes, you can pay premium and set goals by grams (which I‚Äôve done) but your daily breakdown still is shown in % and I‚Äôm not able to alter my calories outside of what loseit has preprogrammed for me so the % values they give means nothing to me. I also have to update my goals every morning & my goal screen insists on putting an average for the week instead of giving me what I need at a glance for the day. I wish I spent the extra money on MFP so I could pre-set goals for specific days and choose between a gram view or % view. I went by the brief explanation of premium features and expected what they suggested they offered. It‚Äôs a nice layout, aesthetically pleasing & has an Apple Watch app but for carb cycling this is a headache. Very disappointed.",

I used to do another program where you track points instead of calories but I didn‚Äôt want to pay $20/month or weigh in at goal monthly to keep the app. For less than 2 months cost of the other app I have access for an entire year to the premium version of this and it‚Äôs worth every penny.

But even then, I find something similar enough and go with that. It‚Äôs easy to change mistakes or add more food, but my favorite part by far is this: when you put food in for a meal it immediately generates Calorie counts and a pie graph to separate macros. Without this app I‚Äôm just guessing and quickly figured out I was drastically off my daily intake without the log, so I wasn‚Äôt making any gains. With this I make all kinds.",

When I started with the app I thought it would be a chore opening the app and logging multiple times a day but instead it has become a ‚Äúgame‚Äù to me a challenge of sorts to better my diet each day. I did all this with the free version of the app but I as soon as I finish this review I am purchasing the full version with the added features as it is the right thing to do the to monetize the app creators.

With this app, I‚Äôve gone from gaining more than 10 pounds per year to losing 8 pounds in 3.5 months. I simply log everything I eat, log my exercise and stick to my calorie budget. If I have a day that I am over budget, I make it up within the same week so that I am within the weekly budget. No type of food is forbidden on this diet, which fits my lifestyle a lot better than more limiting diets. It only takes a few minutes a day to use the app, so it has easily become a new lifestyle habit. I plan to continue to use the app to monitor food intake for weight maintenance.",

There are listings for items I eat that you just don‚Äôt find anywhere else (go ahead, try to find a Premier Protein Vanilla shake already listed in most diet trackers). And it keeps different totals organized for you for easy references. Documentation is amazing, with the ability to produce daily, weekly and monthly reports, either printed or emailed.

First, a BMI calculator, this will help users to see there medical body score and to reach a goal of ‚ÄòNormal‚Äô or to help people with ‚Äòunder-weight‚Äô scoring gain back in a healthy way. Second, actual meal times. Anyone who has successfully lost weight understands that balancing calories and exercise, and timing you meals correctly are key to success. Third, the option to ‚Äòmaintain‚Äô a normal body weight. Instead of just lose. I think the app is a great addition to daily routine even with out these features though.

Also, it gets my steps off my Apple Watch and takes the calories I‚Äôve earned and adds them to my calorie allowance, huge plus! I‚Äôve always used the free features just fine, and my husband upgraded my account when he found a sale.

I LOVE that I can input recipes and use servings from the dinner recipe I created. One thing I wish the developers would add though is a place that I can mark if I‚Äôm pregnant or not.  I‚Äôve used this a few times while being pregnant and while it can record what I eat just fine it can‚Äôt show me if I‚Äôm meeting all my daily nutritional requirements because those change during pregnancy. Also the weight and calorie aspects become completely null since every pregnancy experiences weight gain and that‚Äôs not due to bad eating as well as calorie requirements change. So great app, I just wish I could tell it if I‚Äôm pregnant.",

I am on a six week streak of tracking my meals and workouts. It's very simple, free functionality allows the user to not get overwhelmed. I might purchase the premium at some point and will update review, but at this point the free version gives everything I need - I can always find a meal similar to what I'm eating to record it, I can set exercises for anything from running to kayaking based on time, and the results are real - I'm steadily losing 1 lb per week, like my set goal.",

142,5,2018-07-12T15:05:53.000Z,ndstrong,Great results,"I started using Lose it! Because I needed a way to hold myself accountable and stop lying to myself.  This helped me track what I put in my body and how much I was eating, as well as realize I needed to find ways incorporate exercise into my life ( walking more... or even chores like vacuuming).  I will admit, at first I was so use to over eating and making bad choices that I still felt hungry the first few days until my body adjusted to eating correct portion sizes.  I started this less than a month ago, but just by eating better and realizing that if I was going to go over my budget I needed to go for a walk, I was able to drop quite a bit of weight.  You just have to be honest with your self and portions.  Don‚Äôt guess, measure it out to your best ability.  I hope you all have great success too!  I‚Äôm only a few lbs away from my goal weight!",

I‚Äôve always had such a hard time figuring out how many calories I should eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even a snack. This app broke it down for me and made things so much easier. It‚Äôs one thing to record what you‚Äôre eating but it‚Äôs another when you start out light at the start of your day and end with a heavier meal. Something I never knew. I also love how it gives you a projection to look forward to as long as you stay on pace and even recognizes patterns and goes into details about your diet. I‚Äôm currently only using the free version but have been considering the premium.

As long as you are consistent with logging, you will lose. The developers have done a great job! However, my disappointment lies in the purchased part of the app. I personally did not feel like it gave me what I needed. I was looking forward to the insights  on what I was doing incorrectly, or correctly. Instead I was met with such information as... on the days you drink coffee you tend to log or not over exceed your calories.. umm, I drink coffee every morning, so I‚Äôm not sure how exactly that helps. Maybe other areas are good for people in the purchased section, however for me it was a waste of my money that I‚Äôm very disappointed about. Especially being that this was literally the first app I have ever put money into, that‚Äôs definitely left a bad taste. In my opinion, stick to the free version!",

I always felt like counting and putting in every little thing I ate was too restricting and would mess with my head. I finally decided that I had to do something that I wasn‚Äôt currently doing, and I knew calorie counting had been the most successful thing I had done in the past. In my first month of tracking daily I have lost 5lbs and I know now that I will reach my goal because it‚Äôs really not hard once you start using the data to make little changes and improvements. Instead of thinking of it as restricting I now think of it as exciting and empowering as I get input and use it to continue to lose at a comfortable pace. I love this handy little app! Thanks, Lose it!",
148,4,2020-05-28T10:22:56.000Z,Harry Testes,Better than others,"I‚Äôve sampled many of the calorie counting apps out there, and while not perfect Lose it is the best I have used. The reason is the ability to change measurements. This separates the app from others, and allows you to be more accurate. Also, the Lose it database associated with the scanner is by far the biggest and best. None of the other apps come close.  The one complaint is the same for all the apps. Wildly different calories counts for foods. This is because they let stupid people just make food entries. Any user can just make up a food count and put it out there. Many of them are not based on any kind of reality.   The verified feature makes this better, but using that feature isn‚Äôt possible for all foods. Also sometimes I just don‚Äôt want to enter an entire recipe and would prefer to just find something I think is close. None of these are verified.",
149,4,2019-10-24T12:39:52.000Z,KetchR6,I've used this app for over 10 years. It keeps me honest.,"Bottom line, even if weight loss isn't your goal this app helps you stay mindful of  what you are taking in nutritionally wise. If you have heath issues effected by diet I highly recommend this app. You don't need the premium app to get all you need out of it.",

It works great and I recommend giving it a shot. However, I‚Äôm still waiting for it to get an easy way to duplicate entries to both food AND exercise! I can easily copy an entire meal from one day to the next, but I have to manually enter every exercise every day even though my routine is usually the same every day. Please add that. Also, please allow for a search result to remain even after I‚Äôve selected something. I search for Trader Joe‚Äôs, find one of five things I need to enter at the top, select it, then it takes me out of the search. And I have to type Trader Joe‚Äôs again before selecting the next item. Having to do that multiple times for one meal can get a little tedious. Being able to save searches or have the search remain until I change it would remedy that problem.",

It has an intuitive interface, many nice to have features for more specific goals.  My only knock on the program is the watch app.  It seems as if they never tested the app.  I started using the phone and watch app at the same time so, there shouldn‚Äôt be any issues with software version / update issues.  The watch app flickers constantly.  The weight logging portion of the watch app is pointless.  No numbers.  Just a big and small apple.  I made the mistake of pressing one of the apples and weight was recorded down  over 100 pounds.  To which the app congratulated me on having lost the weight of two air conditioners.",

Then, she tried to send me recipes so we don‚Äôt both have to create them. It‚Äôs the same problem here. There seems to be nowhere in the app that she can easily just transfer a recipe to me, nor can I easily see her recipes even though we are friends. I have to go to the email and click a link again and then finally add the item to my list (one of which disappeared after I didn‚Äôt log it right away, and the email request wouldn‚Äôt let me get it again).","We are sorry for the confusion!

I work out (says I burned 493 calories on my watch) but the app still says my allowance is 1,177.. that can‚Äôt be right. Before when I entered my active/workout calories, my allowance went up.. now it says I‚Äôm going over no matter what I do (I should be under today by 350-ish, not over by 152). It‚Äôs not logging my workouts at all after I plugged my watch into it. This is very frustrating and I have tried looking it up but I‚Äôm completely confused. Is this a bug? Do I have to log calories manually even though it‚Äôs reading my workout off of my watch??? I feel pretty dumb right now bc I feel like I‚Äôm missing something obvious but these weird cell watches are beyond me. What gives? =/",Sorry for the confusion here.

182,5,2018-06-06T22:32:33.000Z,_blushingrose_,Love this app!!!,A couple years ago I used this app and ended up deleting it. I was not at a point in my life when losing weight was a real priority for me.,
183,5,2018-06-30T12:29:49.000Z,Late 50's and Fabulous,Very intuitive,"After 2 weeks of use, and personally re-establishing the habit of logging again, I find this very intuitive.  10 yrs ago I very successfully lost 30lbs with weight watchers, so I know the routine.  However, with the changes in their program since then it hasn‚Äôt kept me interested, motivated or on board.  Changes in life got some of the pounds back (injuries, menopause, moves, divorce, job changes...you get the idea), and what it comes down to is that I like knowing the calories v a points system.   The ‚Äúscientist‚Äù in me likes the real story. This app was recommended by my doctor, who said her patients have been successful with it.  Two weeks/3lbs lost.  You get to pick how fast you lose and consequently the sacrifice you‚Äôre willing to make with your calorie intake. It‚Äôs a math problem. Lose It.  Try it, you‚Äôll like it.",

However, lately one of the most important features - updating your weight - has not worked properly. Even after updating the weight it only stays at the updated weight for a short time then reverts back to a weight I entered over a month ago before the more recent updates. I keep updating the app hoping that the new version will fix that issue but it still remains. It is growing increasingly frustrating as it throws the weight loss charts and the time to achieve weight loss goals off completely. Tracking weight loss in that way is no longer an option.  I used to update almost daily as part of my routine so would love to see this fixture fixed. Up until the recent updates, I would have gladly given this 5-stars.",
186,5,2021-04-15T22:55:59.000Z,haleyann333,Love premium! But would like the ability to upload progress photos,"I love lose it premium - it has enabled me to get rid of so many redundant apps like a water tracking app, health notes, and a sleep tracking app. What would make it the ultimate health app would be the ability to upload progress photos! Built in workouts would be nice as well (cardio, weight training, etc. with at home and in the gym options and instructional videos) but mainly progress photos!! It would be nice to have a built in camera and upload ability, and the photos could be linked to a certain day like how notes, water, etc. are but then also have a calendar view with an indicator (dot) there is a photo for the day and you could select different days from the calendar to review old photos for comparison :)",
187,5,2019-10-18T12:25:53.000Z,loss30,Happy weight loss,I‚Äôm very happy with my results while utilizing the lose it app.  I‚Äôm losing weight just like I wanted following my calories intake as It goes down with my weight.  I have been learning how to change my eating habits without being unhappy about giving up certain things that I use to crave.  I really haven‚Äôt even been going to the gym the way I use to.  I have been walking more instead of getting into my car for every errand.  Today I will be getting back to the gym so I can try to make these next 10 lbs come off because these last 5 lbs came off a little slower but I have been attending many family events which means more drinking and eating but I‚Äôm still very happy with my results thanks to tracking everything with lose it.  That is the key.  You must track everything.,
188,5,2021-05-15T18:36:10.000Z,skiniqween,It‚Äôs the first thing that‚Äôs ever worked,"I‚Äôm only about 4 days in and this is the longest I‚Äôve felt consistently motivated and excited about my weight loss. I have struggled so much with developing unhealthy eating habits(starving and binging) through my preteens and teens and this is the first app where I haven‚Äôt felt guilty and wanted to starve. I‚Äôm watching my food intake and paying attention to the protein rather than feeling guilty about how much or little I‚Äôm eating. Now i feel fuller through out my day and understand why I didn‚Äôt before. Not only does Calorie Counter kindly(the genuine notifications) remind you to keep going they also make an effort to ensure you actually understand your body and what the technique your using is actually doing to your body! I typically say don‚Äôt use prescription services but if you can, DO IT",

I have tried weight watchers, Noom, my fitness pal, and tracking calories through my fitbit app, and this app is the best! It‚Äôs easy to choose how quickly you want to lose weight, find food items in their food bank, and build your own recipes. It also keeps track of how many calories you‚Äôve saved over the week in case you want to splurge on the weekend. I‚Äôm down 10 lbs in about 5 weeks and I don‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm dieting. I‚Äôm just planning my day according to my food budget. I will say Noom was helpful in changing how I thought about food, and I think using this app after completing Noom is a great idea. The free version of this app is amazing, but the $29 annual version allows you to connect with your fitness tracker and that helped me a bit. I am grateful this app exists!",
190,5,2018-10-06T19:44:33.000Z,j'adore H,More than just a weight loss app,"The food tracking and calorie/macros counties are great! But really what makes this app beyond 5 stars is the meals if you upgrade to premium. Each week has 400-, 450-, and 500- calorie options that give you a week's worth of healthy meals + sides for 2 and they literally did everything for you! You get a grocery list along with recipes and the recipes are a few steps and easy to follow. I also like that it doesn't have a ton of out-there or expensive items in the menus. You get 52 weeks worth of menus with 4 options for each week, so the premium version has 208 weeks worth of menu planning. Even if you're not trying to lose a ton of weight it's a great investment to have essentialy 4 years' worth of meal planning and grocery shopping thought out for you.",

No need to pull out your phone and pull up the WW app to see how many points something is, the calories are right there on the package. This app also gives you SO MUCH extra information (breaks down your macros, gives you a predicted date to reach your goal, etc) and it integrates with the Fitbit app AND the Apple health app, so you can bank calories from exercise. i.e. I use the C25K app and another workout app (Workouts for Women...it‚Äôs awesome too!), and they both integrate with the Health app, meaning they then also integrate with the Lose It app to adjust my calories! It‚Äôs great! Love this app and thank you to the developers for seeming to think of everything!!!",
193,3,2019-10-25T03:56:35.000Z,Mistar E,Ok tool,"I would give this 2.5 stars but the selection above doesn‚Äôt permit it. So asian guy guy here. This app is great as a general tool. Keeping an accurate account of total calories consumed per day is quite dependable. The total grams of fats, carbs, and protein intake is a good estimate. However, I‚Äôm a body builder too. So accuracy is pertinent to my goals. When you calculate the actual percentages for each category for fats, carbs and protein the percentages are inaccurate. My totals grams consumed today was 470.3, fats 86.1, carbs 169.8, protein 174.8. This app says I had 36 % fats, 32% carbs, and 32% protein. Which is incorrect, I actually had 18% fats, 36% carbs, and 37% protein. Which is still not entirely accurate. So the total grams consumed for each category is also wrong because the total percentage only goes up to 91%. Regardless the app is a great tool for general accountability but do not reply on it whole heartedly. Because the numbers will mess with your head, well if you‚Äôre like me that is.",
194,5,2021-07-21T11:51:27.000Z,axydkj,Great App,I am a 70 year old female and after having my weight balloon up to 178 lbs and trying lots of diets I decided I just needed to pay attention to the calories I was consuming. A friend told me about Lose It and I gave it a try. Very simple to use and I have now relied on Lose It off and on for 2 years.  It has really worked perfectly. The first time I used it I realized my goal of losing 35 pounds! It makes a big difference in helping me to keep track of how many calories I am consuming.,
195,5,2019-08-24T19:10:35.000Z,Chet4d,My favorite app,This program makes it easy to do the most difficult thing in dieting... Keeping a realistic count of calories. I have used Lose it off and on for over a year and every time I track my calories I lose weight. It doesn‚Äôt require a special diet or fancy equipment it just requires knowledge. Lose it gives you that knowledge in an easy to read format. One example is a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù lunch i would frequently eat. It was a vegetable sub from a chain restaurant. I always felt good about making that choice. Well when I entered the meal into loseit I realized it was almost 1000 calories! So much for healthy. Now I can play with different meal options to plan a truly healthy alternative.,

197,3,2020-01-20T18:29:53.000Z,KatieLafon,Not very encouraging,"The calorie counter aspect is great!  But when you finally get some results - you log weight loss - it does nothing. It would be nice to get a little pop up that says ‚Äúgood job!‚Äù or something.   Even if you log weight gain, it would be nice to get an encouraging message.  I thought maybe it would say something when I got to five or ten pounds, but nothing.   The only encouragement it gives is when you finish logging a full day it will say ‚Äúway to go, you‚Äôre on fire!‚Äù  (even if you ate terribly that day)",

199,1,2020-11-25T22:53:01.000Z,The_Grand,‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt download to track KETO carbs ‚ö†Ô∏è,"Unlike most other apps that have a setting to automatically display your net carbs (-fiber) with your macros, Lose it does not. Reached out to their customer service and the said to create a ‚Äúcarb goal‚Äù, and you can see your carbs for the day on the carbs slide. This was easier for them then saying ‚Äúno‚Äù apparently and regrettably paid for the annual for my wife and I. Other apps like myfitnesspal, you can simply go into the settings and change it to display net carbs - easy peasy always displayed upon opening. With lose-it they want you to create a separate ‚Äúcarb goal‚Äù add it, then when opening the app, after checking your macro breakdown slide to your carb goal, open the carbs breakdown and subtract the fiber yourself EVERY SINGLE TIME. This is especially annoying if your adding your foods via barcode photos all day. So warning to anyone on KETO tracking carbs, spend your money elsewhere I haven‚Äôt opened lose it after that week once I used others. Other apps help make it routine, this one becomes another task.",

I am have used several different apps to count calories, carbohydrates, exercise, etc. but have usually given up on them after a couple of weeks because it‚Äôs too much work and somewhat complicated. This app is so easy to use and simple to track my caloric intake. I absolutely love the feature that links to my Apple Watch as well. I have set it up to link my exercise and allow me those extra calories to consume if I want..... and again.... so easy to sync. I can see how many calories I have left right on the face of my watch..... by simply lifting my wrist!!! It also lets me know how many calories I am under or over for the week. Such a fantastic app!!!!!!!!",
202,5,2019-01-09T17:55:39.000Z,Zac Imboden,"Accurate, indispensable and fun",There is simply no easier way to lose weight than a calorie counting app and Lose It has by far the easiest interface with the social media bits pleasantly compartmentalized rather than pushed in your face like rotten cotton candy.,

As someone who works and goes to school full time it‚Äôs VERY difficult to find that extra time to exercise. So I usually count of my step counts for the day (9k+ steps daily) and I‚Äôve had this app for about a week now and it‚Äôs helped me lose that pound it said I would with limiting my calories! Although I‚Äôve always been a mental calorie counter this is by far, so much better, considering that all calorie counts for most fast food, restaurants are accurate ! If it isn‚Äôt, you can simply input it yourself! (Not to mention you can actually input the serving you ate.[Ex. 1/2 a banana]) best app yet!",

One evening back in February, I was cruising around the web, looking for anything that might help and I found the Lose It app.  I though, what the heck.  It can‚Äôt hurt and, nothing else is working.  Feb 11, I started, with the goal of loosing 60 lbs.  13 weeks later, I am down 30!!!  Also, right on schedule.  I am eating what I enjoy.  The difference is that I keep track of everything that goes in my mouth.  I do eat more protein and fewer carbs.  I do eat the protein before the carbs which seems to help with my blood sugar reaction.  I do enjoy chef salads, and make a meal out of then...  The bottom line, this ‚Äúlife style‚Äù works!

It has a very large database of food items and an easy to use user interface.  It has never crashed on me and they constantly update it.

If you follow this app‚Äôs suggestions and be honest about what you eat, you will lose the weight.  Just follow its guidance day after day and stick to it and it will work.  Most weight loss programs will work if you follow their suggestions.  The difference with this app is that it makes it easy to follow and can be your guiding light on your weight loss journey.",

Unlike other times I‚Äôve tried to lose weight without a calorie counter, I never feel like I‚Äôm starving myself. In the past when that happens, I would struggle with eating before bedtime. Now I can know how many calories I have left in my daily budget and eat accordingly so that I don‚Äôt over indulge.

Thanks.  Ps. Am losing slowly which is healthy.  This is not a gimmick but a realistic tool to help a person count calories and therefore learn to be satisfied with less which is what a body needs.  Excess calories equals excess pounds. And who wants achy joints?  Not this chick!,

I decided to start counting my calories and I was shocked when I started realizing this. I was being duped. So once I started using this app I was learning how to be healthier and choosing more healthy options. Do I want a soda or something that will actually fill me? I started making good choices and the pounds really did start coming off. I feel more active and happy and want to do more things with my kids. I am not so tired and my headaches have declined.

The premium version is well worth it for the one time a year subscription fee and the extras provided. The free version provides more than any other app of its type that I am aware of. There are only two suggestions that I have. The first one would be to continue the ongoing improvement of the picture taking ‚Äúsnap it‚Äù feature of the food as regards accuracy in future iterations. It still has trouble identifying some very common foodstuffs. The second one would be to finally add some more themes. While this may not seem very important, it helps me not to get bored while using the app day after day- and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one. Otherwise, keep up the good work!",

I would have to say this probably isn‚Äôt very accurate and it needs to be looked at. I have been using the app for over a month now, and I have a hard time believing that everything I log is somehow a positive daily pattern, leading me towards my goals.

Or it may be I just don‚Äôt know how!  That is I would really like it to sync withy fit bit. The app it does sync with only gives steps when I have my phone in hand which is not 24/7. My fit bit I do wear 24/7. The other issue I have is that on the calorie counter there are sometimes multiple entries for an item all with different calories. Sometimes hard to pick which one to use. The final issue I have is that when I put a recipe in I can‚Äôt find where to edit it if I want to change an ingredient. These are minor but they would be nice. Otherwise I do like the ease of the calorie counter, the tracking of weight and exercise. I‚Äôve tried other apps and this one is my go to one.",

I never had given the notion of eating more sensibly a second thought.  A friend suggested the ‚ÄúLose It‚Äù app as a tool to keep track of the foods I was eating, and to use the app to set goals for where I wanted to be.  It worked beyond my wildest expectations, and in one month of using ‚ÄúLose It‚Äù I have lost 15 pounds.  All of this was accomplished simply by becoming aware of what was going into my body, and then following through with the caloric intake suggested by the app. The app is extremely well designed, and even the free version provides a multitude of useful information and practical tools.

It‚Äôs also VERY easy to find foods and create recipes. But here‚Äôs the most important thing: it keeps a running total of the calories you are over or under for the WEEK. Somehow this helps me be more accountable, and therefore, successful. In the past, if I was bad one day, I wouldn‚Äôt count those calories, I would just start again the next day. Since it keeps calories for the week (as well as the day), I log EVERYTHING, even if I have a bad day, because I want my whole week to be accurate.

For example I have a recipe for a salad ‚Äì all the ingredients add up to 214 cal as displayed on the recipe breakdown page. But when you add it to your log it shows 281 cal. This happens all the time to different recipes. 67 calories isn‚Äôt huge but they add up and when you‚Äôre trying to be accurate, it‚Äôs a big deal. I‚Äôve reported this numerous times over the last few years and they don‚Äôt fix it - they just say that it‚Äôs been reported to an engineer to investigate but don‚Äôt expect to hear back from them.

The logging in of meals did work, until leader and participant changes. Lose it on the iPhone was perfect, I logged in everything and after retiring, lost 30 lbs with an increasing amount of walking. I still walk a lot and in 2014 connected it with Fitbit and I stabled with loss of another 5 lbs.

Caffeine, alcohol, dairy, sugary crap and bread are now gone. Plenty of fresh vegetables and some fruits. Big salad at dinner with fresh lemon as a salad dressing. I am down over 20 pounds in 6 weeks with 20 more to go. No exercise. I have a bad hip and I am waiting for Cardiologist to release me for cardiac rehab to begin safe exercise.

The one thing I‚Äôve disappointed with from the beginning is the community feeding data into the system. It‚Äôs a great concept and is one reason the app is so useful, but there is so much useless noise. For one thing, why not eliminate any food that just shows calories but no macros? Surely if something is 300 calories per serving, it should have some carbs or protein. I‚Äôve encountered dozens of entries that just show calories. Secondly, give the community a chance to flag or remove items we know to be incorrect. There are so many entries that are just plain wrong that it can be frustrating trying to find one match that actually has the correct info. I end up entering my own quite frequently.",

Initially I just needed to monitor my caloric intake and see what foods in my diet were working against me and track the results. I would recommend it for anyone! I also think it is amazing that you can make Lose It & Run Keeper sync together by paying an upgrade fee! The only downside is most of the challenges are pretty lame as they‚Äôre just created by customers and there‚Äôs no insensitive to compete and try to win even if they are decent.

The only thing I don‚Äôt like is even in the paid version they hide advertisements by calling them promotions and use catchy titles in the app. What I like the most about the app is I can plan my meals. Easy to add and delete foods to see if they fit my daily budget. The barcode scanner makes it really easy to add foods and then it remembers you meals so the next time finding it is really easy. I first thought it would be too time consuming but it‚Äôs so easy and quick to do. I also like how it tracks trends like what foods I eat are high in fiber or high in sugar so if I‚Äôm shorting myself in a macronutrient I can target food I already regularly eat/like.

I‚Äôve been working SLOWLY towards my goal weight for nearly 6 years, off and on, with LoseIt.

I found I was eating some healthy foods that were much more caloric than I thought and restaurant foods are ridiculously high in calories. It gives me the information and extra discipline to carefully choose that last snack in the evening knowing it is all I am getting. If I go over a little I take a walk until the app says I am back on target. Twice during very active days I realized I was at negative net calories and ate a healthy meal. This has prevented my metabolism from slowing down which has happened on prior weight loss attempts when I significantly under ate. The app lets you look up almost every processed food including specific brands and fast food although mistakes in the choices.,

I'm not adverse to paying for apps when it benefits my needs - I have several apps I pay/subscribe to. The developers of Lose It have done their best to insure I will never subscribe to Premium even if I might think it could be useful. I respect developer's right to be paid for premium features. In return I expect some level of respect from developers for my decision as to whether or not I need those features. The developers of this app have no concept of this. They've bypassed aggressive marketing and gone to all out harassment. Every single time I go to log food I'm greeted with a pop-up add to subscribe to premium. Harassment yes and I guess their way of administering punishment to those who do not subscribe. All they have accomplished with this tactic is to deepen my resolve to never move to premium. If they next decide to cripple the free version will there are other adopts out there.",

After always having a normal blood sugar, mine had come back elevated, not super high, but enough to make me realize I needed to do something about my health.  Since that time, I have lost, and kept off, 15 pounds and my blood sugar has come back into the normal range.  If I backslide and see a couple of pounds start to creep up, I get back to Lose It! and take it back off. It helps me make better choices and I‚Äôm never really hungry.

The data base of foods has been so easy to search and I find exactly what I am looking for 99% of the time. You can even create and save recipes from home cooked meals or scan bar codes of food items. When I first started using this app, I logged every meal and snack for 10 days straight and found I was much more mindful of what I was eating. If I wasn‚Äôt hungry or the right food wasn‚Äôt available, I didn‚Äôt eat. When I lapsed and didn‚Äôt log everything for a couple of days, I know I was eating quite a bit more of the wrong foods.

Mind you, I have had to alter what I consider ‚ÄùGo To‚Äù foods, and find different, more wholesome ways to stave off hunger cravings, but if I stick to plan, it works. It is pretty eye-opening what calories I could rack up without giving it a thought. No wonder I had so much weight to lose! I am so relieved to get things under control, as I know all that extra weight makes me feel tired and sluggish, hurts my knees, and makes it hard to find clothes that look good on.

My ONLY complaint is the graph for your macros, no matter what I do, it always shows the fat as a larger portion of the graph than it actually is. For example, I'll have 20 grams of fat compared to 120 grams of carbs and 60 grams of protein and it'll show up as 70% of the graph and it DRIVES me insane.

For the last year, I seemed stuck and needed a different approach to weight lose so I created a simply Numbers‚Äô spreadsheet for my Mac and iPad.  For ease of data entry, I established convenient food groupings and highlighted meals of special significants.  Most importantly, I formatted column widths to display a full week‚Äôs worth of data on a single screen for easy evaluation and planning purposes.  The spreadsheet is still a work in process but since using it I‚Äôve lost weight and have gotten control of my diet again because it presents information relevant to my lifestyle and preferences.  Lose It is a worthwhile app but it has become cluttered with features of no value to me (TMI) and I‚Äôm unwilling to pay $40 a year to eliminate advertising.",

It is easy to use and has many useful features. Their database of foods is very comprehensive and includes organic as well as conventional brands. The ability to read bar codes is simply awesome!  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the daily totals (goals) do not distinguish between Fat and Saturated Fat. This would be an easy change to the app, as the data for each is reported when foods are logged, but it is not included in goals or the summary of the daily report.  This is very important to many of us watching our health. Also, an update with micronutrients shown in the daily totals would be wonderful, especially the major ones like Calcium, Vitamin D and other key vitamins.",

I didn‚Äôt really want to lose weight as I was already where I wanted to be (thanks to Lose It for helping me with that a while back) But keeping track and counting carbs and fats and proteins as directed by my Dr and Nutricianist was a real pain to do everyday. But with the paid Lose It version, it‚Äôs really easy to do now. And I love that I can scan labels of my foods instead of hand entering. Thank you Lose It. This app was better than all of the Carb counting apps i looked at. Easy to use.

I started using Lose it in February 2018, within two weeks of using the app I lost 4 lbs. And by August 2018 I dropped 6 dress sizes and lost almost 20 lbs.  But then I got complacent and thought I learned enough about portion control and measuring calories and carbs, so I fell off the Lose it wagon. Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt gain weight immediately (I was still working out).

I wish that all food items had the ability to be measured in grams. Really. I wish the water intake had a scroll wheel, rather than only the ability to add or subtract 8 oz and then needing to change the total, by then using a scroll wheel. Bizarre. Lastly, I think the recipe category is basically useless. It‚Äôs easier to figure it out myself because in the end the app doesn‚Äôt have the correct serving size options. Craziness.

I lost a significant amount of weight about 12 years ago while training as a collegiate cross country athlete and the primary way was by counting calories. At that time it was tedious and time-consuming because I had to calculate everything myself, write everything down on paper, and constantly add the totals multiple times a day.

The app does all of the calculating for you, calorie intake vs exercise, and shows  you your allowances and keeps track of it all.   I find it  very helpful to see how much and what types of foods I am eating.  It graphs a break down of your fat, pro and carbs.

However, one big thing is missing which is the ability to easily create recipes with quantities of weight or volume rather than just servings.  Currently if i want to add my own recipes in weight or volume units, I have to first create a recipe,  add the entire recipe temporarily to my log to view the nutritional breakdown, enter all the nutritional details into a spreadsheet, manually and physically weigh or take the volume of the new recipe, calculate the nutrition by weight or volume units, then manually enter everything back into Lose It in a new custom food.

I was scared that I would go over this already low number that I would often starve myself and eat 900 calories. Yes I lost the weight, but in an unhealthy way. After research, eating this few calories will burn both muscle and fat. You actually do need to eat just a SMALL caloric reduction in order to maintain your healthy muscle percentage while losing body fat. Just be careful and monitor your mental state.

For the ‚ÄúRecipes‚Äù category, you should be able to create folders so you can organize your recipes. (Ex: You can create a folder for breakfast recipes, lunch, dinner, etc) That would really take creating recipes to the next level. 3. Under ‚ÄúMy Food‚Äù, you should be able to add different foods.

303,4,2019-01-14T09:27:30.000Z,tattoo.chic8124,I like it for the most part!,I do you like this app for the most part. Everything works the way it supposed to except for reading my Fitbit. When I sync my Fitbit it say it‚Äôs working correctly but it‚Äôs not reading all my steps or my calories burned after exercise. Even when I force sync the app still isn‚Äôt Fitbit correctly. Then when I manually put in my exercise it‚Äôs still zero exercise for the day and I notice some date won‚Äôt stay. For instance I manually put the steps in for the 13th of January but the app just sent me a notification saying I entered no steps for that day. I had to go in and put them again. It‚Äôs not fun putting things in twice. I definitely will not buy premium if it can‚Äôt keep simple data entered like steps or record exercises.,
304,5,2019-01-30T15:32:29.000Z,Clan Witch,Perfect!,"I started using this app for weight loss and general health and wellness more than a year ago after subscribing to all of the apps I could find to trial them, including ‚Äúthe most popular one‚Äù. This suited my needs the best. It was the only app that allowed future meal planning, an essential part of getting into a healthy lifestyle. The data bank is the most robust I‚Äôve found with easy options to add your own recipes. It‚Äôs also super easy to use for this 66 year old Luddite. I‚Äôve now paid for a lifetime subscription having used this app to assist me in a 100# weight loss and lifestyle overhaul. I expect to use it every day of a long and healthy life!

305,5,2021-05-16T13:54:54.000Z,Erikinfresno,Critical to Health Management,"Regularly monitoring your food intake is critical to managing your health.  There is probably a couple other apps that do similar things. I just can‚Äôt imagine it being easier than with LoseIt.  I log everything 90% of what I eat.   Occasionally at the end of the day, I know where I‚Äôm at and the last meal I‚Äôm having so I don‚Äôt bother logging it.  But it takes seconds and I gotten off my health several times over the years and each time logging my food was out the window.  Because of all the stimulus around I think it‚Äôs critical for the long term unless you literally eat the same things on days and know the values.  Anyways, LoseIt is a top priority for my health and well-being.",

But never have i been trying to ‚Äúlose it‚Äù I use your app to measure macros, water intake, etc. And this app has even helped me to gain weight after suffering severe food intolerances, gut health issues, etc. I believe your app is so much more than just weight loss - it is HELPFUL FOR ANYONE TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH and by branding this way you are losing a wide variety of markets. (To be honest i get embarrassed if anyone sees me open the app for the fear they might think i am trying to lose more weight on my generally skinny frame) Great lifestyle and health app and i think you deserve to call yourselves more than just weight loss, you‚Äôve grown beyond that",

It‚Äôs so easy to track calories and specific foods, and to keep track of your running totals daily, weekly, monthly, etc. This app taught me a lot about food and caloric intake!",

It also sets you up with a weight loss plan, which is amazing!! You just type in your goal weight and pick a date you‚Äôd like to achieve it by, and it will set up your account with that amount of calories per day, SUPER easy!! You can also sync it with Apple health which is helpful for steps. Overall, this app is really easy and helpful to use, and has a lot of amazing features in just the free version. Thank you!!",

Well I'm 3 months in and have weighed and recorded my food intake and weight daily. I have let the program modify calories allowed per day and have lost 32 to date. It says I should hit my goal the week before Christmas. I'm using the free version and it works for me. I will be recording my food intake when I get to my weight to maintain. So, many return to their old weight once they stop their weight loss program. I can do this indefinitely. Thanks Lose it! Best gift you can give yourself is a healthy you!",
310,5,2017-11-05T15:40:10.000Z,SusanBL,No place to hide!,"This app keeps you from fooling yourself about the real number of calories you are consuming.  It makes recording your calories quite easy with actual recipes I use, as well as the usual fast-food calorie counts.  Even when I have to figure out the calories in something I made that‚Äôs not in the database, I just estimate what proportion of the ingredients I‚Äôve eaten.  Even if you love sweets (I do), you can eat less of them or compensate with a low-calorie meal, or, best, just get some exercise, which this app accounts for, and still have the occasional dessert.  I‚Äôve just made it through Halloween and continued to lose my half-pound per week.  I picked slow loss, but it‚Äôs been steady and very satisfying.",

You can track your weight each day and make sure your on target to reach your goal. So far I have lost 7 pounds and have continued to lose weight. This app has helped me live a healthier life and I cannot thank it enough. I cannot believe this app is free for all it has to offer. I would definitely recommend this app for anyone looking to lose weight because it makes tracking it so easy.",

The simplicity of logging your food and the guided plan makes it seems so easy that I am not sure how I could never lose the weight before.  I did struggle whether to give this 5 stars because the food database is a bit difficult to sort through (because users can enter food to the database ) but decided that the value of having so many foods available to choose from when logging far outweighs the annoyance at trying to figure out which one to choose.  Better to have too much data than none. Thank you Lose it! I feel amazing!,

But then over the past few years after gaining about 20 lbs. post-college, I found myself exercising regularly and eating healthy, but not losing weight. So about a month ago I turned to this app to give calorie counting a try and see what it‚Äôs all about.

Good in ALL regards EXCEPT, when sharing recipes they never work on mobile.  Recipes be accepted via mobile but never show up to log.  If you can make it to the desktop browser via iPhone, and make your way to log it (poor experience on phone), then the recipe will show up.  After adding the recipe in this roundabout way, it is now available lazily, like ‚Äúyeah, no big deal, I was just waiting for you get po‚Äôd, now I‚Äôm here‚Äù.  It makes you want to never cook or just eat out of boxes with bar codes because it‚Äôs so much better than to log items this way.  Fix this and it‚Äôs a good app, until then, seek a different one.

This app has been with my diet since day one and is a very useful tool. I‚Äôve used it to lose 127 lbs so far. My favorite aspects are the chat groups of people with similar goals, and the weight log line graphing. This app also has a premium version, but I‚Äôve never used it. It‚Äôs too expensive for my college student budget, and I wish there was a way to earn the premium. Perhaps by logging in a certain number of days. The amount of features only available in premium are my only big negative for this app. Overall, I‚Äôd recommend this app to anyone that wants to positively improve your life by getting healthier.",

321,4,2018-04-09T16:04:33.000Z,Ollie & Trixie's mom,Very helpful,"This app makes me accountable for everything I eat. There is only one flaw that kept it from being a 5 Star. That is, there  is no real definition of serving size. The guides are too general and vague. Each food measured by serving size should actually say what the serving size is, especially with prepared or restaurant dishes. One serving of each food is equal to how many cups, ounces, etc. otherwise it‚Äôs just a guess and since restaurant servings are huge I‚Äôm sure the portions are not the actual serving sizes. In spite of that I‚Äôve lost weight and kept it off. As long as I am consistent in recording my eating then it works. I also like that it syncs to my Fitbit charge 2. This makes it a complete weight loss/weight maintenance tool. I also like that it lists so many foods.",

I found this app and man do I love it! I really have to plan out what I‚Äôm going to eat and then work to exercise to get the calorie bonus if I went over my daily calorie goal. It‚Äôs been very eye opening for me the amount of calories that are in some things and a bit humbling for how I used to eat.

It was really eye opening to see how much that extra bit of food could set me back & decide if it was really worth it or not & a view of the longterm consequence of indulgence now. It was a spectacular tool & it no longer seems to be working. Any edit I make, makes no change to the target date. Please reinstate that feature, it‚Äôs the only thing preventing a 5 star review.",

Since starting it I‚Äôve lost about 18 pounds. It absolutely isn‚Äôt just a calorie counter. It hooks up to your phone‚Äôs step counter and it can hook up to your smart-watch. You can record exercises as well; which is extremely useful because it lets you know how many calories you‚Äôll burn off. It‚Äôs helpful if I go over my daily budget and spurs me on to exercise.,

Soluble fiber is 2 calories per gram. Seems like the app subtracts fiber from total calorie intake making the calories seem lower than they actually are. That‚Äôs okay if all the calories from fiber are just insoluble (no calories) but I can‚Äôt tell the difference because the app doesn‚Äôt list differences between the two. And what about the difference between added sugar and regular sugar.

I‚Äôm using the nutritionist guidelines on my calories allowed. This app would have given me more. I manually adjusted the calories lower. At my all time highest weight, I‚Äôm down 95 lbs.

It‚Äôs a (albeit simple) calorie counter that breaks it down by meal. The real problem with it is that unless you‚Äôre willing to fork over $40 or more for the premium version, you‚Äôre stuck with the basic functions which are just entering food items and counting calories. I I normally don‚Äôt care that Apple makes all their developers incorporate in app purchases in their apps but holy cow does LoseIt! Take it to another level. Every single time you open the app it bombards you with an ad to buy the premium version. I DON‚ÄôT WANT TO BUY IT!!! Not only that but the app inputs the health data into the health app in a bizarre manner that makes using the health app to view your progress IMPOSSIBLE. Don‚Äôt waste your time. This app is a shameless cash grab feasting on those who want to lose weight. Paying these money vampires $40 won‚Äôt magically make you lose weight.",

The main issue I‚Äôm facing right now is that the food section which includes recipes for ready-made meals does not apply the proper nutrients when added quickly to the log. In some situations also the meals that are provided are not really properly calculate so you get extra calories or missing information on nutrients such as fats proteins and carbs. Also be careful about the pictures because the recipe does not always contain the full details of the meeting as shown in the picture. They need to work much better on this when updating the recipes. Also the customer service are not really solving this issue I‚Äôve contacted them for a week almost and not date has been provided by them.,

I‚Äôve started a new ‚Äúplan‚Äù after each pregnancy, but now it says my total weight loss is since 2010 (my join date), which is not the case.

Life gets busy and I usually take a hiatus around finals week because I don‚Äôt make it a priority, but it does send you encouraging reminders. I like it because it gives you a calorie amount for the day, specific to your height, weight, and weight loss goal. The more you use it, the more it becomes a lifestyle change. I‚Äôve lost 20ish pounds in 2 months using this on the daily and not exercising. (I know, I should exercise too but I‚Äôm a busy gal) Give it a go. Seriously.

The plan is easy to do, its just tracking your food but with the addition of seeing very basic 'nutrients'. I try to follow a Mediterranean diet, so 35% fat, 20% protein and 45% carbs, with meat three days a week. It was a breeze with this app. I ate crappy meals on the fly but now their healthy.

Then, if you want to use the same meal item on another day, you cannot see what was in the recipe without starting from scratch again.

The next day it would be 50/cup, and it would then change every entry I ever made of that food. I would change it back to the correct cals., and it would then randomly change again and again. This happened with a number of foods. When I contacted LoseIt, their explanation was that any user can change food stats. These were foods I scanned in and did not share. And they didn‚Äôt seem concerned about it in the least. That my food intake would be say 800 cals by lunch and when I go to log dinner it has changed to 650 because users had changed food stats.

I also wish there was a way to easily transfer the same meals from one day to the next without having to read-enter it all over again for another day.

The USDA says to exclude naturally occurring fruit sugars from ones‚Äôs conservation calculations, but this app includes them. This is dangerous. I don‚Äôt eat any refined sugar at all, no processed food or sweets, yet because I eat beans and have a banana in my plain oatmeal every day I‚Äôm over the preset daily 25 grams of sugar. Please fix this. Setting it to a lower bar because of poor nutritional education could cause people to hurt themselves.",

I consider myself extremely lucky to have randomly found them three years ago and now the app is in my dock apps on my iPhone. Setting goals...easy. Tracking your food consumption...effortless. Monitoring progress against your goals...simple, especially when you integrate it with the health data from your Apple Watch or a integrated scale for weight and body measurement tracking.",
348,5,2019-10-18T15:41:26.000Z,eatygourmet,Lose It is a great app,"I am very pleased with this free app. I have been using it for over two years and have found that I am most successful if I log everything I eat and the portions of each item. The list is comprehensive and includes fast food and store brands. You can also set goals for yourself and Lose It will adjust your calorie intake and give you pointers. I do not use all of the features of this app (I have a fitbit for exercise logging and do not transfer). They have made improvements over the past two years as well. I would like to be able to add steps, but as of now I can only add mileage or distance. You cannot ask much more from an app that is free.",

I thought I could go without tracking and ended up gaining weight back from stress and over eating. I‚Äôve tried intermittent fasting and a semi keto diet since, and found my self right back at Lose It for success. I know I have a few months to go before I reach my goal, but I know I can do it with the help of Lose It. I learned that, for me, being a life time subscriber is a must for achieving the best me possible. If you allow yourself the time to track, and track honesty with yourself, you can‚Äôt go wrong with this app. Far better than weight watchers. Been there, done that too. Good luck on your journey!",
350,5,2018-09-03T14:06:59.000Z,Unique username,Useful deep and complex,This program is really useful for raising your awareness of your level of activity and what you were eating. Before using the program I have been trying to lose weight for several months and not made any progress. I started logging all my exercise and what I ate and little by little weight started coming off. My biggest complaint is that it's quite complex and takes a lot of poking around to figure out all the possible functions.,

Once you accept this notion, this is the ultimate app to getting you on track. It‚Äôs super eye opening and really forces you to change the way you eat. Buy the upgraded version, it‚Äôs worth the money to pair with your Apple Watch or Fitbit for added benefit and you get tons of good recipe ideas and workouts. I‚Äôve lost five pounds of in my first week of using this (all water weight and bloating, but I feel so much better). You don‚Äôt need to pay for a crazy subscription like weight watchers or do an insane workout regiment to lose weight, this makes it easy.",

For anyone looking for a way to log your food and water intake, it does not get any easier than this. Nearly every food is already in the database and if it‚Äôs not, you can literally SCAN the barcode on the package to add it and all its nutritional facts instantly! For anyone wanting an easy way to lose weight and track your progress, this app does it in an easy ‚Äúset your goal weight and date‚Äù way.

I think that the free version works great but a few weeks ago I decided to purchase the app for the rest of the features.  I am pretty happy with it.  When I don't use the app I can see the scale number going up.  When I use the app, I can see the scale numbers going in the right direction.  There is just something about tracking everything that you put I to your mouth.  I also like that I can track how much water am drinking, so I can make sure I am drinking enough.  I notice that the days that I feel hungry and eat more calories are the days that I forget to drink enough water.",
355,4,2021-01-12T21:47:03.000Z,DianaCLK,Almost perfect,"So I really like this app. I track everything i eat and drink religiously! I find that when I do not track my food I don‚Äôt lose weight because I tend to over eat. I rated this 4/5 I added a friend thinking that we would be able to compete and see each other‚Äôs food logs but that wasn‚Äôt the case. I‚Äôm not sure what the benefits were when I added her. I paid for the app for the year and just thought it would be really cool if you guys added something where we could add our friends to our circle and we could all see our logs. To be able to share what we are, workouts, if we were over or under would just make this app so perfect. Would make losing weight with friends so much more fun and doable.",

But it‚Äôs so easy to track everything and has helped me both with portion control and limiting foods that are extremely high in calories while enjoying SO many things I love!  My only complaint is the constant push to go premium, but I get it.  I have recommended this app to everyone and continue to do so!  And since I started using it 75 days ago I‚Äôve lost 25 pounds, with another 30+ to go...but most importantly with a sustainable change in eating habits!  I couldn‚Äôt be happier.",

To this date I have been able to lose 50 lbs. and plan on continuing to use the app until I reach my goal weight and probably beyond that to maintain a healthy weight. The free app is easy to use, deducts calories for exercise which I find motivational, and has an extensive database of food listings and their calorie content. I highly recommend this app as an indispensable tool to all those who are motivated to lose weight, desire to achieve and maintain a healthy lifestyle, and are willing to make a long term commitment in doing so !",

Mostly, id like more freedom to pick my calorie goals, and to be able to set them differently per day, same goes for macros. When setting macro percentages or gram goals, id like to be able to match those percentages to your grams, not have to individually set both, or vice gersa, have grams inputted show your macro percentages. When meal planning ahead, I'd love for the app to show me that meals macros, instead of showing empty until you ""eat"" them. Otherwise, how do I know of Im meeting my macros when planning? Overall this app is superb, I really love how colorful and fun it is to work with, makes meal planning that much easier.",

It was very easy keeping track because everything is so organized and done well. Unfortunately, I got lazy and gained most of the weight back, but I started using it again and once again I am taking it off quite easily. This time I will use it once I have lost my weight for maintenance. It is hardly an imposition. I would highly recommend buying the lifetime version.  There are so many benefits, of which the one I like the most is planning my meals as many days in the future as I want to. This is a key to helping me lose weight so easily.",

I love the intuitive program design and that it gives prospective dates on which you will meet your goal. I never felt so in control and that it was even possible. I started at 133lbs and I‚Äôm down to 123 in less than a month. This app works! There‚Äôs nothing out there that‚Äôs comparable.",

It‚Äôs very insightful seeing and actually being aware of how much you eat. BUT I‚Äôve just started the keto diet. And I‚Äôve found that counting carbs is a little difficult when I need fiber in my diet. I would definitely like to see the fiber subtracted from total amount of carbs so I can accurately count my net carbs. It‚Äôs deceiving swing a certain percentage that is higher than the net percentage goal, and definitely discouraging when the app tells me I‚Äôm over my goal even though half of it is fiber.

I recently noticed that this post-holiday pounds weren‚Äôt going away and I was worried. Could this be an unavoidable part of middle age, I wondered. I tried to cut back, but it wasn‚Äôt helping. This app allowed me to approach weight loss like a simple math problem. I entered everything I ate, it calculated the calories and provided guidance. It also made me realize that I wasn‚Äôt exercising as much as I had previously. That motivated me to get moving more. It‚Äôs helping me lose the extra pounds!

The app has helped me keep track of what I eat and stay accountable, as long as I stayed committed to it, and also has changed my eating habits (can‚Äôt even eat as much now lol). I‚Äôm sure I would‚Äôve lost more sooner if it wasn‚Äôt for my Sunday cheat-day. Much thanks to the app creator for this invention.

Only suggestion:  some of us aren't 20 or 30 years old anymore.  I have to go off-site for exercises for gentler routines.   I still love you though,Lose it!",

One thing I enjoy is that I have a calorie-smart cookbook that I have been able to add my own meals to this app which has been great.

I determined my BMI (easy calculators on line) and how many calories I should limit myself in order to lose weight and  I started using the lose it app. So far,  I have lost about 10 lbs simply by keeping track of calories and daily walks. I plan to keep using the app until I reach my goal and then I will recalculate how many calories are permissible to maintain the new number. I plan to continue to use the lose it app to continue to keep track. Maybe I‚Äôll be able to wean myself off the app after while.",

Unfortunately, it seems as if loyalty is not as important to the app developers as the bottom line ($$$). Every time there is an update it seems that functionality of the app gets worse (I imagine it‚Äôs all the ads that continuously get added). Further, the ads for their ‚Äúpremium‚Äù version get spattered across the food logging screen. This really hampers convenience when trying to enter data.",
394,5,2018-07-29T06:21:06.000Z,Chedwall,40 Pounds in 6 months,"Due to a recent back injury, I thought losing weight might help with the pain. It didn‚Äôt, but it gave me the motivation I needed to lose the extra weight I‚Äôd been carrying for a few years. My exercise is limited due to my injury, but I tracked every day. I stayed within my budget 5-6 days a week and watched the weight disappear. Be consistent with your tracking and you‚Äôll start to realize what foods are high calorie and which are not, and it really helps to plan your future meals. I didn‚Äôt weigh my proteins or anything so sometimes you just have to guess the weight. I tried to overestimate so I wasn‚Äôt cheating myself. Good luck on your journey!",

I love how it counts down your allowed calories so that you can keep track of how much you are actually eating during the day.  I never realized how much I was actually over eating until I started to use this application.  Now, when I reach my allowed amount or less, I quite eating for the rest of the day.  If I plan on going somewhere that involves food,  I can plan it into my day to save up allowed calories.  I also like that it is on my mobile device.  I can immediately put my portion sizes into the application so that I'm not guessing later on or forgetting to add something.  This application is wonderful.",

The fact that I always have my phone on me is part of the reason, but also the data base this has of food already logged in it saves me from having to do a lot of math or figuring stuff out myself. I also really like that it figures your workout and steps taken into the equation too so if you burn more calories you get to eat a little more too, it encourages me to workout and take longer walks! I have been using this app for about 2 weeks now and I‚Äôve lost 6 lbs and it‚Äôs projected that I will meet my weight loss goal in 6 months if I keep it up, I am so ready!",

I have tried a few different trackers and decided to come back to LoseIt as it has been the easiest to use. Unfortunately I just now notice where Premium is lacking. I am in my menopausal years and I would really like to be able to track my calcium intake as well as Iron. Many of the other trackers have this option and it‚Äôs kind of surprising LoseIt does not include the option under ‚ÄúCreate New Goal‚Äù.  Please consider adding more nutritional information.

It‚Äôs attached to my Apple Watch which makes logging exercise so easy. It shows how many calories you are under for the week which I find motivating even if I go over a couple of calories on one day during the week. Also it doesn‚Äôt have a stupid apple in the middle turning completely red if you go over one calorie. That other app worked for me but wasn‚Äôt as motivating as this app. I‚Äôve lost 3 pounds so far after plateauing on the other app for a month.

I had some success, but knew I could do better. Once I tracked my calories 7 days a week I made my goal weight and decided I could lose 5 more. I always incorporated exercise in my routine, but being accountable for my calorie intake has put me at a weight that I haven‚Äôt seen since my early twenties. I turned 50 this year!

Tracking calories really helped me put in perspective what I was putting in my body, and how much everything I ate costed. Knowing and managing a daily budget helped tremendously, and I always felt accomplished no matter what I did provided I clicked that little check mark counting all the things I ate throughout the day.",

There‚Äôs been some features that I wanted to see and some have been popping up in updates little by little, that‚Äôs awesome. One feature that I think will be really convenient is the ability to transfer everything you ate during a lunch to the next day or around your week. For example I meal prep and I‚Äôve added everything that I ate yesterday for my meal prep, the chicken the heavy whipping cream, etc, etc. Today I have to add that, item by item again, I wish I could just take everything I had for lunch yesterday and copy and paste it into today.

I love all the options for displaying nutrition and goals, and the intuitive tricks and tips are super helpful. I would have given 5 stars but I have a pretty serious safety concern. When you finish logging it tells you what date you will achieve your goal. However, there is no safety warning if you eat an unhealthily low or dangerous number of calories. Instead it just tells you that you will achieve your goal weight much faster. Oh, you only ate 500 calories today? Great job! You will achieve your goal weight in just 2 months. This is a big problem for folks with eating disorders and can encourage people to starve themselves. It's irresponsible and encouraging people to make unhealthy choices.","We apologize that this has been your experience with Lose It!.

It's a great concept because it's sustainable weight loss. It's more about accountable calories and portion control than anything else and it has really worked for us. We like that Lose It tells us our calorie count for the day and the week because we typically dine at restaurants more on weekends. So, this allows us to plan ahead on calories during the week knowing we may go over our daily allotment on the weekends. We've recommended this app to family, friends, and colleagues- and all have had positive feedback as well!",

Out of all the ones I‚Äôve tried‚Äîeven weight watchers‚Äîit‚Äôs my favorite. My ONLY problem is that you can‚Äôt change the calorie amount for exercises UNLESS you create a new exercise. I would much rather choose an exercise category that is already available on the app and just change my calories burned to match what I‚Äôve done, than to have a million different exercises that I‚Äôve created and have to skim through when the time comes to track. PLEASE update this. Compared to other apps, it‚Äôs a small problem to have but a real one nonetheless.",

As a person with digestive issues and food allergies, it would be great to have the ability to log what time I eat something or exercise. Additionally, it would‚Äôve been extremely helpful to have been able to write down notes for any given day while I was going through doctor-ordered elimination diets. I‚Äôve been tracking for nearly two years and it helps, but having features that allow for a deeper evaluation of not just what we eat, but why and how we feel after we eat would make this a much more valuable tool.",

Sure enough I weighed in a few days later an all that weight was gone pulse another two pounds.

This app helped me to lose those pounds easily without feeling deprived of food. It made me aware of what I was eating and encouraged making better choices. I come back to it from time to time if I see myself getting off track in making healthy food choices or if I see a gradual increase in my weight. I suggest you make realistic goals and plan to lose weight gradually. That way you will be more likely to succeed and you‚Äôre new food habits and choices will be easier to maintain.,

Most recently, I got serious about losing weight in order to control my blood pressure. The app is very easy to use and has a comprehensive list of foods, identifying not only their calories but all of the other content of interest. Scanning makes it easy not only to add a new food, but to conveniently find an item which might be buried in the very long and comprehensive file of foods.

Before LoseIt, I would overeat, have no idea how many calories I ate, give up and overeat the whole day, all on repeat day after day, week after week.  Not anymore.

It tells you what you do good during your happy weights and what bad habits you need to break and monitors every little thing of your diet and exercise goals. Used the free version for a year and lost 20 pounds and went premium during a discounted session two weeks ago and have already lost 5 more with the meal plans and diet breakdowns.

For example, if I put in an egg, some say a large egg is 76, another is 91, and another is like 10-something. I can‚Äôt fully trust what the calories are so I have to double check it on the package or on google. Might be good to have the items placed by the app to be one color and items placed by users in another. Other than that, it‚Äôs great!",

For me, dieting is not my ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù, so I just use this app every new year for about 2-3 months to lose weight. I find that my weight loss is almost a mathematic science made visible via this app. In summary, I look at my resting metabolic rate and basal metabolic rate estimate on google, plug in my food and exercise calories, make sure each week net a negative 3,500 calories, (1 pound), validate it with my electronic scale AND eventually I‚Äôm where I want to be. There‚Äôs no mystery for me about dieting, because the facts are made visible via this app. And because if it, I see the mathematical progress. That matters to me and works!",

I‚Äôve used it twice in the past few years when I really needed a structured method to lose weight and be mindful of what I‚Äôm putting in my body that stresses it out (hello carbs, refined sugars and bad fats). It only gets better with each update. Just stick with it to enter your meal consumption - it really gets easier as it becomes habitual with greater use. And the rewards of gaining more mindfulness that helps control your portion intake and making smarter choices with food is significant. Used it twice now and successfully lost the weight I wanted.

I have been using the app daily since early February 2020. I started with Noom which is good too. But it was too expensive. I purchased the annual subscription of LoseIt after a week because I feel a good app and good program deserve my support. I also tried MyFitnessPal and felt LoseIt was better.  Honestly I can‚Äôt think of major criticisms except that you can‚Äôt share pictures with the new friends you meet in the social section. Also links are tricky to share. But these are not deal breaking flaws. This app still deserves 5 stars.,

I‚Äôve started tracking my macros as well as training weights four days a week two days a week cardio. This app is so much easier to work and has so much more of a food list with an even my fitness pal. I track everything in grams and it gives it to me straight forward as to how much I‚Äôve had and how muchI need for the day which keeps my goals right in front of me and stead of like my fitness pal where it‚Äôs a percentage that is constantly fluctuating with my Gram set up on the side so I didn‚Äôt know how to read it I would be off all the time.

I am learning to swap certain foods for better choices because of it.  It integrates with my Fitbit Inspire 2 perfectly. This app has been a major player in my battle to lose weight. I have recommended this app to my nutritionist and life coach. Best counting app out there. (I do have the premium version and its well worth the cost.)",

It lets you set goals and shows you a chart of how good your weight has been. It also lets you create foods. Lets say you made a broccoli cheddar soup. Instead of putting all the separate ingredients every time, you can figure out the calories the first time, create a food, adding the calories and naming it broccoli cheddar soup. Then you can just use that every time you eat the soup. Also, it shows your recent foods in case you have foods you eat regularly. I totally suggest this app. You can get premium, but you really don‚Äôt need it.",

Now the more I‚Äôve used it the more I like this app. If you are a detail person, you‚Äôll enjoy the many features this app has to offer.

I love that it calculates everything for me so I can see when I‚Äôm going to hit my goal weight so it‚Äôs not an abstract concept it is super motivating.

It would be nice to see some foods if they have weight on the label to also have that option instead of trying to multiply 2/3 cups and instead put how many grams it is. I love the visuals and trends and feels like a little more gamification with the badges. Where my fitness pal feels like a plain notepad writing down calories in and calories out.

This is really lazy and makes no sense. I also don‚Äôt like the removal of the spinning wheel to set the amount of food. Now you have to type it in, which is a lot less fun and slower in most cases.

My husband had a stroke a year ago. At that time we were in the process of moving from 10 acres-2 homes, an office and a barn. I‚Äôm 80 years young and all the packing, disposing of a large estate was left to me.  I ended up with a crushed vertebrae which was very painful for 6 months. I have been my husbands care giver since his stroke. Our lives have finally settled into a good routine so I have time to now take care of myself.

I just can‚Äôt lose weight.‚Äù I encourage people to write down everything they eat but logging free-hand is hard for most. Lose It! enables anyone with a smart phone to get it all down, quickly adjust for portion size, scan bar codes for instant usable calorie and ingredient data; and incentivizes exercise by helping calculate calories burned and subtracting them from what you‚Äòve already consumed. So I‚Äôm excited to use this for patients. And for my own life, Lose It! Is proving to be a difference-maker. Accountability is the lynchpin of personal change.",

If everything you eat is packaged and includes number of calories then it is easy to track. But if you make a salad for lunch from what is available from the fridge then this really helps. Six ounces of this, three cups if that, a tablespoon of the other - how many calories? This app seems to include whatever you need to find. Makes it easy to track and it can help you choose which is better a banana or grapefruit. You can track your exercise. It has a bunch of generic stuff and you can add. I added qigong and Taichi.

I saw my weight going up and I started Lose it again after trying intermittent fasting. I hated to wait to eat, so I ate all the hours I was off fasting.  It was not my thing but Lose it is definitely a program I can follow and be honest with. I think the weight loss was because of tracking what I ate, and being aware of things I ate. I just started my 1st week and already feel like I‚Äôm in control. I hope everyone else has luck with their weight loss programs but I can only say Lose It is a great way to go!",

You may end up eating processed and unhealthy foods if you only look at the numbers. Keep in mind you can eat fruits healthy fiber rich carbs and monounsaturated fats even if sometimes it looks like it‚Äôs bad for you based on the numbers. Don‚Äôt rely on this app to dictate your diet only to keep track of numbers while you already have planned a healthy balanced diet alongside around 4-5 hours of exercise within your abilities a week.,

This one is so much better. It has every food in it already and if you can‚Äôt find it, it reads bar codes so will enter it for you.

I was logging my daily food intake with pen and paper but decided to try an app for convenience when I was planning to go on a trip.  I wanted one that was similar to the Weight Watchers app and had a barcode scanner so I could scan food packages instead of inputting the information manually.  Lose It! has done everything I needed plus more, and I am very pleased with it.  I do wish it would keep track of my fat and fiber without requiring a premium upgrade, but overall I am very satisfied with it.  I give it 5 stars.",

I told everyone about it and lots of people used it - likely the premium membership, too.  I have a tight budget and do not want to pay, and now have found now that LoseIt! requires a premium membership to synchronize with my FitBit.  FitBit imports my LoseIt! data, but this is cumbersome.  LoseIt! Is obviously promoting Apple products (watch) and in doing so they have lost any possibility of my going premium - or recommending the app to anyone in the future.  It's ok.  FitBit plays well with everyone and will now be my main source instead of a supplemental app. I'll use the free LoseIt! to log my food until FitBit incorporates a caloric logging system.",

Keeping track of how much fat you eat is really an eye opener to how bad we eat. I cut fat down to 20% or less and kept my calorie count within my daily limit (usually less) and immediately started to loose weight. I started using this app 5 days ago and I‚Äôve already lost 10 lbs. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù and started at 233.5 lbs, this morning I weighed 223.2 lbs.

I‚Äôm a realist and do cheat at times (that‚Äôs real life), my biggest cheat is red wine.

I just enter what I eat and see where I‚Äôm landing against the Loose-it recommendation. Easy to adjust and never hungry. You can eat light for breakfast and lunch, using few calories and then gorge on pasta for dinner and a McDonald‚Äôs ice cream cone and still come in under the recommendation for the day. Easiest program I‚Äôve ever tried. Lost 4 lbs in one week and eating everything that I‚Äôm interested in eating.

Then I realized a few days ago, since a lot of the recipes and food items come from other user‚Äôs entries, they aren‚Äôt always verified or accurate. So I‚Äôve since had to click into foods and double-check the macronutrients before adding them to my log.

Its easy to use and although it pushes a bit to much on premium (no telling me everyday I have have chicken isn't an incite) I think it does what it's meant to do which is give me a simple goal (eat less calories than a stated goal) and rules to play by.  My recommendation to everyone is don't just default to your first search on types of food because the calories can be way off. I wish there was a way to tag some foods as wrong as to allow others to beware.  Anyways I recommend it all the same because I've lost 130 lbs using lose it.,

Also, prayer along other success stories has kept me inspired. I notice that I snack too much and it adds up big time. So, it helps me to see and correct my eating behaviors that thwart my weight loss. Some people have used the app for years and are just now having a break through. I say that to say that this app helps you to see what‚Äôs working and what isn‚Äôt working for weight loss and hangs in there with you giving you a chance no matter how long it takes to actually lose the weight.",

I work third shift from 6pm-6am so I have to add my data from the two days. If there was an option to set your hours differently my calories and steps would all be on the same day and My stats would be more accurate for my so called day ( I could also eat more since I burned more calories for the day and they Aren‚Äôt split between two days) I would love to see this update.

Several features (updates on how long to my ideal weight with current habits, menu items to remind me of ideal foods, etc) keep me motivated to notice a lapse in judgment and keep me from returning to old habits long term.

I wish you could edit the search items that pop up which are blatantly wrong like fried chicken fast food meals =300 calories, however this is necessary evil of a shared database that is usually pretty decent.

My Apple Watch tracked my exercise so that is super easy. I lost my 15 lbs one day before my ETA. When you go into ‚Äòmaintenance‚Äô mode, my daily calorie count went up. As a bonus, they send fun texts when you reach milestones.... ‚Äòyou just lost the weight of a French bulldog puppy!‚Äô It is fun, easy and best of all, it works!",

My confirmation email specifically offered me four ways to reach customer service. The 1st I tried, email,  bounced back with a ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt monitor this mailbox‚Äù message. Whoa. The toll free number, likewise, only gives a fast-busy signal ‚Äúnot in operation.‚Äù Yikes. And then the online support very aggressively pushes you to use web boards and chat-bot, but none of the offered answers were relevant! Paid apps really MUST offer better customer service, people!

534,5,2018-10-10T15:56:36.000Z,Krajci3,Use it and it works!,This is an easy app to use. Because members contribute foods and information there are many food choices that come up when you search. I find it very easy to use. The recent updates make it extremely easy to track food that you have consumed in the past. The badges that you receive for small and large milestones are encouraging. Once you get into the app the premium benefits are well worth the price. Try the free app to start off with. It is a great way to just keep track of your food or to really get into the nutrition That you are consuming.,

It worked well for me but that app has not materially changed in many years.  It was very boring and I guess I was tired of it.  I'm really enjoying the enhanced features and graphics of Lose It!  I bought the discounted annual premium upgrade about 10 minutes after downloading Lose it-I spend too much time in tracking my diet and foods to not use the premium version of the app -I stumbled upon it by accident and was very happy to switch.",

I tried for weeks to monitor myself, making sure I‚Äôm exercising rigorously everyday and eating healthy but I just wasn‚Äôt losing the weight. Finally I downloaded this app and literally within 4 days I lost 5 pounds. This app really make you monitor what you eat and how much you eat and how good it is for your body.

It‚Äôs harder for me to see. It takes longer to adjust quantities. I don‚Äôt need all of the nutrition information front and center. I can read that on the food I‚Äôm eating. I want this app to track my calorie content and nothing more. There‚Äôs no reason to change these things. It doesn‚Äôt make it any better it just makes it different. And in my case it makes it harder to see. Please please please please just leave these sorts of minor things alone.,

One of my favorite things about the Lose It app, was that I was able to enter into the exercise section, that I walked 2.5 miles or 1.3 miles, unfortunately, now the decimal point is missing from this section and I can no longer enter in an accurate amount of miles each day, and have resorted to guesstimates.

My doctor suggested weight watchers, but I wasn't thrilled with paying more money for another program that may or may not work for me. Lose It is a perfect solution, since all I really need is a reliable way to track daily food and calories.

As other people said in the reviews, it will not make you loose weigh just by using it, but it really encourage to do (eat) the right things everyday. Tracking every bite you take and what you drink every day, really helps you to be more realistic and honest about your calories intake. While you can do the same thing writing it down on a piece of paper,  the app is fun to use and very detail in calculating all your stats. It get to be very personal when reminds you about logging your meals. Also encourage you to keep up with your goal.",

To plan ,I write down what I plan to eat on that day in the morning then eat exactly. This is how I lose weight the fastest. I record any variance after dinner. I also weight and record first thing every morning before eating and drinking anything so I have a true baseline. I promised myself at 25 that I would never weight more then 130. I am 5'8"". Now I am 58 and weight 132.2 and I am contently using the app to get back below 130. This app is a great tool to help me lose weight.",

I like that it gives you an estimate for when you'd reach your goal weight, I feel like that has helped me stay on track more than anything ever has because it's something I can actually visualize. But I really don't like that you have to pay for premium to connect your Fitbit or other device though. It's also SUPER annoying that when you scan a food it doesn't just put in the whole package, it's only in ounces and grams and I'm just not going to measure food like that. Other apps don't have the same issues so I'm not sure why it's like this. I guess it's its own thing but it doesn't work for me as anything other than keeping track of my weight only. Bummer.",

Whenever I gain or lose a few pounds, the app automatically changes my calorie budget not just for that day *but also for the past four days.* If I lose weight and the app adds 400 calories to my budget for that day and the previous four days, it looks like I was eating 400 calories _under_ budget on the days leading up to my goal weight; conversely, if I gain weight and it takes 400 calories away from my budget, the retroactive change makes it look like I was eating 400 calories over budget the previous four days.",

The part where the app lacks is in the food area for supplements with the micro-nutrients/vitamins. The sustainabody app would be a good app to take note of for future updates.

I still yo yo but as soon as I start logging in to lose it I‚Äôm back on track. It really helps especially as one ages - you won‚Äôt lose weight as quickly but lose it points out that fact also,

With Lose It, I eat what ever I want!  Counting calories always deterred me from any diet, but because Lose It makes it so easy I decided to give it a try.  I‚Äôm not on a diet!  I eat what I want!  Lose It tells me how many calories I have to use for the day.  You enter your 3 meals and snacks. There are so many ways to search your foods, It‚Äôs that simple!  I‚Äôm learning to keep eating the foods I love and I don‚Äôt have to change my life style!  You must try this app. Thank you LOSE ITüíï",

The app used to provide the exact calories I was over or under - but now it just says ‚ÄúI am at my calorie budget for the week.‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know what it will say if I go over - maybe just ‚ÄúI am over my calorie budget for the week?‚Äù I‚Äôm trying not to find out.)

He lost 40 pounds and has kept it off for a year. It is an integral part of his health routine. This app is very easy to use and is a great tool for anyone who is committed to consistently track and monitor their food, water and or exercise. It works.",

My only suggestion to the developers is to 1.) Have an option to toggle bonus calories on or off for step counters (when it‚Äôs connected to the health app on iPhone) and 2.) Make the weight loss graph more dynamic. Allow me to see possible future projections and dates. It has the dotted future line, but the time graph is too ‚Äúcoarse‚Äù to make use of it.",

I never have a duplicate but I have a treadmill data list I‚Äôll never use again.  Also, while it lets me add time and calories it doesn‚Äôt let me add miles so I‚Äôd like to see that added.

If you are serious about losing weight and need help to track your calories / workouts, even talk to other people who are using this app or get emotional support then I really recommend this app. Only thing, I don't like the constant ads popping up about purchasing there premium account.

I am in bed a lot and I have been trying to do crunches since I can‚Äôt really do a full sit up.  I also do an exercise where I lift a weighted ball over my head and try to sit up.

It is simple, easy to navigate, and effective. Ultimately it always falls on the individual to follow through and hold themselves accountable, but this tool has been a major component to my success. The resources are useful- even to someone who has researched health and fitness for years, the social aspect is supportive and feels like a community, and the calorie counting tool is easy to use and structured logically. I strongly recommend downloading and using this app.",
596,5,2019-10-24T11:09:00.000Z,AnnieJ347,Simple and realistic weight loss,"I lost 30 pounds and my husband's lost 65 by tracking calories. Lose It makes it simple by calculating how many calories you need to lose what you want each week, having calorie counts at your fingertips, and remembering the foods and meals you eat regularly. I wanted to lose slowly so my goal was 1/2 pound a week, which I lost consistently, and have now maintained for 5 months. I went from wearing size 12 to size 4. My husband lost 1 1/2 pounds each week and not only changed clothing size but has been able to lower his medications.",
597,4,2020-09-17T22:05:18.000Z,Andieisme,Good overall but a couple of small glitches,Great app overall. It definitely makes counting calories easier and the goals available in premium are worth the price.,

Because I have been drying OMAD, it is critical to be able to count my calories and track my weight. This app is perfect for me.

I haven't tracked food consistently on it, but I can see the graph showing my weight losses and gains after various pregnancies since then.

As long as you stay disciplined, it‚Äôs a great app to use. Kind of wish the free version  had a way to copy and paste foods into future meals like it used to, but either way it can work for you.

You now have to pay for the Premium app to sync your device. I‚Äôm sure the app developers have a good reason of why we now have to pay almost $30 a year to sync it but that‚Äôs where you lost me because I knew it used to be free.

After an ill-advised hiatus from Loseit, I reinstalled the app in 2017 and was delighted by the many improvements (tracking water, tracking nutrients, linking to exercise apps, excellent foods database). It is quick and easy to use. I can customize the notifications to be as obnoxious as needed to get back into the habit of logging. I also appreciate the Premium account (perk of being an early user - no cost!), since it lets me delve into insights and correlations between good and bad choices on food & exercise.",

Be faithful about logging everything and don‚Äôt get discouraged for once-off mistakes. Just log it and adjust your intake later to stay on track.

I didn‚Äôt know what a good calorie was from a carb or what a good amount was for my daily intake.  Lose It taught me how to make conscious decisions on what I was going to eat.

I scan the barcodes and select my serving size and add it to my day. So far I have lost 4.5 pounds in 15 days.

I went on a health/weight loss journey and started using the app about a month after I started my journey. The food data base is mostly user submitted. That means a lot of the foods you search is inaccurate, tweaked, or incomplete data. Other than that, the app is hugely beneficial to my success. I have went from 230 lbs down to 187 lbs and owe a large part of my success to this app. It helps to keep my honest with myself and gives me a daily goal to stay focused on. I highly recommend it.

Also, the green check mark indicating the nutritional information has been verified is a big plus. I would give the app a 5-star rating if there were more verified foods.

Recently, I started noticing that my protein and carbs were lower than usual. I was eating the same foods I always ate. Then I added the protein and carbs itself, turns out, the app was adding my net carbs and protein incorrectly. This is a huge deal being that I always count my macros and I‚Äôm on a strict macro budget. The app says I have room for 50g of protein when I already reached my max when I do the calculations myself?",We're sorry for the trouble you've encountered.

I think with the help of this app I'll be able to reach my goal weight quickly. It has made me reevaluate how much I eat, and what it is that I'm eating. As well as checking all the caloric intake.

After you log for a few weeks It finds trends with certain foods and helps you discover which foods and behaviors help you stay on track or don‚Äôt. I also record my blood sugar every few days on it and the graphs are very helpful. It also gives you encouragement when you lose weight and it‚Äôs super easy to record food. Just try it for a week! I have already lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks, I had been in a stall for a year before this.",

My weight is down lower than it has ever been and I feel like I‚Äôve never been on a diet. I do small splurges for holidays and birthdays and then go right back to my calorie calculator. Because I travel a lot, I do check out menus at restaurants before I get there and try to figure out what makes the most sense.

Easy to know why: it is necessary to keep track of food intake and exercise calories. I am actually below my target weight. Why the low rating? Because last night, after restoring my iPhone from a recent backup when I bought a new iPhone I lost ALL my data. I had not updated to the latest version, did not have an account with the developer‚Äôs servers, and had no problems with their ads. But no other app erased my information like this one. Intentional or not, this happened because backing up to iCloud, something that had never failed in all my years as a user, was not enough. I do not intend to start again.",

I‚Äôve logged in online, through the app, through my apple account, etc. only to get more and more frustrated as there was no easy way to cancel.  Today I get a bill stating that it has renewed and if this happened in error to enter into App Store to request a refund.  I request the refund and explain in my 200 words or less what has happened.  I get an automatic response as soon as I hit send that says I do not qualify for a refund.  Once I receive that message, I am taken to a screen that allows me to cancel my subscription... only to find that it means for the NEXT renewal which would have taken place in 2020.  What a SCAM!

Before starting this my last of many diets to lose weight, I researched to find out just exactly what constitutes healthy eating, ie, what should I eat, what should I never eat and how much to eat. I set goals, rate of weight loss, calories, ratio of calories to protein to fat, never to exceed limits on saturated fat, sugar,  cholesterol and sodium and also exceed limit on fiber. Then I started looking for an app that would monitor my goals. After two failed attempts, I found this app that totally meets all my requirements.",

Has little reminders and if you forget to use will send you a notification to let you know to log your meals.   Keeps track of exercise and also sets your goal weight and date and tells you how many calories a day to eat to keep on track.  Reminds you weekly what you‚Äôll way on your goal date so if you cheat you‚Äôll see where you are going wrong and will discourage you.   Hope it helps you.  I like it!,

For me, this app hasn‚Äôt been about dropping pounds while maintaining my current view of food, rather it has helped to change my view of food so that my weight loss can be sustained, healthy and manageable.

I prefer Lose-It‚Äôs simplicity and good integration with Apple Watch but I miss the more complete summarizing of nutrients that MyFitnessPal provides.  I like having the simple view in MFP showing how I‚Äôm doing in nutrients vs my goals. I can dig for the information in Lose-It (premium) but the simple reports focus on calories, fat and protein. I would really like being able to see sodium and others as well. (Including on the watch). That would make it a no-brainer 5*",

That feature disappeared near the end of August and is very disappointing.,

I'm 115 lbs lighter, and that done without any significant exercise, got my new joint, and got my life back. I became a pro member in the first month, because I can track my blood pressure, blood sugar, water intake and measurements, so I could see all the results I was having along the way.

I know several good approaches to improving weight/health, but the basic formula of eat fewer calories of the right foods and move more are the foundation of each.  I know several friends who really benefitted from this App.  I downloaded it.  It took more than a week of the program prodding me for me to actually start, but now the process has begun.

My goal is to watch what I eat, with specific amount of macronutrients per day. The premium allows me to do that. I also like that I can take a picture of every meal because I want to be able to come back in the future to check what food works good and not for me, and having that visual aspect definitely can help me to get back on track if I once again fall off the wagon (which I have done that many many time).",

It helps a lot to hold myself accountable to goals, both daily and toward a planned total weigh loss. I haven‚Äôt purchased the pay-option, but that looks like it could be even more helpful, and I might, down the road. For now, the calorie per food item information and tracking has been helping a great deal. I highly recommend it.",

The app is easy to use, has tons of stored data on foods and calories, and stores goals like steps, blood pressure, water consumption, and weight all in one place.

I do find the visual of it more appeasing than MFP, and I like the badges and rewards, but I won‚Äôt pay $40 a year to have the things I can have on MFP for free. On top of that, it only tracks my steps from my HealthKit instead of my Garmin so my steps are anywhere near correct. I would love to transfer data to here from MFP since I have 620 days logged in a row, and 5 years of data on top of that.

It is rewarding because the results are directly related to how well you‚Äôve stuck to your own plan. Set your own goals and get encouraging remarks as you go along. As you figure out what foods have less calories, you discover foods that are healthier for you that are satisfying. As you stick to monitoring your calories, your healthier eating becomes a habit and a lifestyle, and then it is no longer a diet but a way of life that will result in a healthier weight and you!",

There are too many steps to go through to see how much weight I've lost over time. The button to see my weight over different periods of time is difficult to get to. I can never find the button to edit my goal weight. And the app tracks weight loss from the highest weight and didn't take into account the ""yo-yo effect"" that many dieters experience. So it tells my I lost x amount of weight but this is inaccurate, because my weight ballooned over the holidays. I hope the weight tracking gets streamlined.",

The only thing that has changed is the restaurant menu nutrition information has gone downhill hence the 2 stars.  I find too much incomplete information and inaccurate. It seems that other can add info, and they are often off or incomplete compared to actual info from companies.  The problem is that many often get the little tag to make them look legit or official when they are not.   I have gained some of my weight back after a bad accident and now I am using the app again, but the information is not as reliable.  Is there a way to filter out the bad info?",

However, instead of being sensible and billing at a larger flat rate it‚Äôs another one of those annoying monthly subscriptions that everything keeps trying to push. So it will help you lose weight if you‚Äôre honest- but it will also ask you to join the premium version every time you open the app.",
727,5,2019-04-22T17:49:16.000Z,willwrk4vodka,Paid for premium,I paid for premium. I think it was worth it. Better than weight watchers and all the other paid stuff. It tracks a lot of stuff. Shows you a lot of things you never realized you do in the ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù.,

It is set up from 12 am to 1159 pm. That works for most people, but I work graveyard so I am on a 1 pm to 7 am schedule and would love to add to the accuracy by being able to personalize this.

I would set a goal, reach it, and maintain it. As a result, I not only reached my goal but exceeded it. In sum, I lost 30 pounds when I only knew that I was 10 overweight. I would never stop now.

Just raises awareness of calories in all that you are eating and motivates you to keep below your daily goal.  Little motivational banners are nice including positive trends when spotted.

And it worked.  30 pounds off and, more importantly stayed off until stress eating at the start of the global pandemic. Easy, quick, and provides incredible information.",

The information is not as easy to follow as on other apps which I‚Äôm being told to switch too. I contacted customer service and they reiterated that they are not keto friendly.

I understand that maybe you believe younger people are only doing this due to body dysmorphia but allow me to assure you that not all teens are like this and that body dysmorphia comes in ALL ages. Some people, like me, want to live a healthy lifestyle.

It's much easier to find items now, even unusual ones. However, the latest upgrade is awful. The top half of screen where we enter portion amounts is now crowded with the basic nutrition label information which leaves a small area at the bottom for scrolling through portion options. Also, it seems like often brand name products are listed before raw or bulk. For example, ""peanuts"" brings up Planters or Or another brand before you get the plain bulk type.

Their profit model is reasonable, and the ads aren‚Äôt overbearing. Perfectly usable without paying anything. Very, very user friendly. The UI isn‚Äôt complicated and a new user can easily navigate the app and find the info they are looking for. One of my favorite features is the food entry. So far, the food database has been pretty solid and spot on. Makes food entry really easy and quick. Would recommend.",

It made me aware of not only what and how much I was eating but how many calories I was consuming. It helped me with meal planning and really kept me on track. I‚Äôm 60 lighter than I was in March!  I have recommended this app to friends as well as physicians. This is truly a greatly useful app and will continue to use it once I reach my goal. Also very user friendly!",

With 2 young children I have not been able to get to the gym like I once did, so I needed a different option to cut a few pounds. With the help of this APP, I‚Äôve been able to cut 10 lbs, 10 lbs that I thought would be impossible to lose. Lose it makes it so easy to track calories throughout the day, and I‚Äôm so thankful to find this APP. I have reached my BMI goal of 22! Thank you!!",
930,5,2017-10-18T10:14:25.000Z,rkbor,Makes a positive difference,"Even with running and working out it is easy to over eat and not get the weight loss results one is looking for. Tracking meals and snacks makes the difference. Developing the habit of logging every food intake is the first success, and then letting the tracking modify what/if you eat is the next. And it does work. This app makes it quite easy to log food, better than others for sure. Highly recommended for health goal success.",
931,4,2017-10-30T22:53:25.000Z,Kharybdis,User Friendly,"I've been using the app for 3 months and have lost 10 lbs! Really helps you get an idea of how much foods ""cost"" in terms of calories so that you can budget your day. I also like being able to visualize my weight changes on a graph. I prefer the user interface to that of MyFitnessPal which I tried along side this one for the first month before switching solely to LoseIt.",
932,5,2017-12-07T10:15:38.000Z,vre newbie,Stop the update insanity,Love the program. It has a lot of really nice features and tracking capabilities.  But every time they update the program (which seems weekly) it wipes out some of my saved data.  It thinks I just started keeping track of exercise and food that day.   I have been with Lose It for two months but it tells me congratulations you have been tracking your meals for two days.   Fix that and it would be a six star program.,I'm very sorry for the trouble with this! Can you please send us an email via help.loseit.com so we can look into what's going on here?

While its database of food items is large, it could be just a bit better. I think MyFitnessPal has a bit more in its database than this one since I‚Äôve found myself looking up things online when LoseIt didn‚Äôt have what I was looking for.

I weigh less than I have in probably 20 years.  Different weight loss methods work for different people.  Having a daily calorie budget based on my age, height, and weekly weight loss goal has made all the difference.  I was never told I could or could not eat that.  It was up to me to make sure I stayed within my daily calorie budget.  I recommend this app highly!",

I have lost over 100 pounds in that time and no longer struggle with 6-8 shots of insulin daily. I record everything but water if it goes over my lips. I‚Äôm a believer and cheerleader! The reward banners recognizing accomplishments are neat but the real motive is a healthier me. New cloths isn‚Äôt such a bad thing either.

But there is not a lot of encouragement if you‚Äôre not losing weight. I mean, there is a badge for 5 pounds and 10 pounds and 25 pounds and then you have to wait until 50 pounds before you get any other kind of encouragement on weight loss. Not that I live for those Badges, but it seems like there could be some kind of reward for continuing even when you‚Äôre not losing weight. Right?!?!  I‚Äôve been stuck at 30-30 for a while.",

I was wrong.  I avoided it because I thought it would be tedious to do. But this app makes it a snap to burn more calories than you consume. And you can set your own goals and take as much time as you need, so you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre ‚Äústarving.‚Äù Use the app whenever you eat anything, don‚Äôt lie to it or yourself, and you WILL lose weight.",

It also works in conjunction with Garmin wrist monitors to fairly accurately track and adjust calories for exercise done.

My thought process became simpler as I logged, I already knew how many calories this or that was and food choices was easier.

Needless to say it as taught me about portion control and thanks to that I have lost 15 pounds at a rate of 2+ pounds a week. I should also mention that I eat everything I want including dessert. The difference is that now instead of getting a large portion, I measure it to ensure that I am being portion conscious.",

So, 11 days have passed and I have lost 10 pounds. It is working! I am really liking this app! I am 6ft, 220 pounds when I began. Now weighing 210 pounds as of this morning.

Now that the option is premium only I will be looking for a different app when I hit the year mark. I could see paying for all the special parts of the app but I have been using the weight goal feature only and it isn‚Äôt worth paying $40 a year for that.

Unfortunately for me to go several years back to see what my diet was is far to difficult. I have to click the back arrow button over 1000 time to find out what I had to eat 3 years ago. Why not let us click the month and bring up a calendar which would then allow us to change the year as well? Why isn‚Äôt there any easy way to see past entries?,

And the spam has huge pictures that fill my screen so I have to scroll so much to see my sisters updates. It‚Äôs so annoying and makes me wish I hadn‚Äôt renewed my paid membership.

The premium has more features that if I wanted to use them that I would pay for them.  The one feature that was free was that it would give bonus calories from my Fitbit usage.  Apparently, Lose-It was giving that as a free part of their free app usage however they decided that they need to charge for it.  It is a shame that the company decides to bait and switch their features that accommodate them.  If they give a feature as free from the beginning, they need to keep it as free.  I reckon that they like to sucker people into using their app with free stuff and then months later, start charging for it.",

I love the database and how supportive the messages are. Where it needs improvement is the recipes section. I just had to add an ingredient to the database and that logged me out of the recipe I was putting together with no option to go back in and edit.

My muscle mass increased a lot while fat dropped. I actually started to notice the muscle curve on my arms, shoulders and legs, which I was never able to get when I was even thinner before.

The work is done for me on most everything that I routinely have to eat or drink. All I have to do is log it and/or scan it to put it in my calorie count. For me, seeing the numbers and realizing the additional workout required to make up for over indulging myself makes it easier to just pass on those things I should be avoiding. It is perfect for me!!",

However, I also saw an increase in saturated fats per grams. So to test my suspicion I inputed an additional apple. WHAT? Again an increase in saturated fats.

They‚Äôre developers seems to be right on target with correcting bugs and always making this app run smoothly.  My only complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt support Intermittent Fasting.  It would be amazing if it did because I know you‚Äôd make an excellent tracker and provide great options for all IF customers.  I hope you can help improve it.

1107,5,2021-05-24T15:02:39.000Z,jkdurden,Great app.,One critique I would give the developers is that the icons on the lower menu at the bottom of the page are too light - practically invisible - there should be more contrast down there for usability.

I‚Äôve done six days and have lost 4 pounds. 16 more to go. Not bad for a 70-year-old dude. If (I mean when) I reach my goal in six weeks I think I‚Äôll sign up for the lifetime plan.

I have used this app for years and slowly they have been taking away features from the free version. Also every time I load the app there is an add to upgrade to premium.

Sorry, but I‚Äôd rather not have to pay extra expenses just to remind myself how much water I drank and or to gain access to preview future dates. Also, knowing what this app used to be prior to the upgrades just makes it even more of a challenge because I‚Äôm stuck with  ‚Äúwhy am I paying for this when all these features used to be free and I was already paying annually?‚Äù Anyway, the app had a good run.. gotta look elsewhere!",

Zero carb foods get 1 net carb no matter how many times I delete and re-add then. Huge bug for someone watching net carbs! I deleted the app and reinstalled and that did not fix such a huge issue!

I wish they sent notifications when they made a change to the app then I could look closely at the aspects I find invaluable right away and do my own user acceptance testing!  Actually I wish they did an adequate job of regression testing!  Very frustrating.  This happens much too often.  I paid for lifetime Loseit and feel like I signed up for a lifetime of pain!

Then realized all I was really doing was calorie counting so I switched to Lose It.  Much easier to use and more effective too.  Most foods are already stored in the app and adding foods and recipes is easy.  I especially like the breakdown of fats, proteins, carbs, cholesterol, etc.  Makes it easier to catch bad habits and continue good ones.  Worth the small monthly for premium.",

Water intake is crucial and this helps me keep track. I just wish you could adjust the units as I drink 10 oz bottled waters vs 8 so I have to add on and extra 8 ounces as I log the 4th to make it 5 8oz waters for 40oz. Also follow the multiple meals and snacks and try to stay in the guidelines. More eating times helps the metabolism continue to work. Great App.,

My favorite feature is scanning barcodes and magically all the stuff on the nutrition label goes right in there. You can take pics of ur meal too. I suggest getting a kitchen scale too. That way you know exactly what you‚Äôre eating. You can enter your weight daily and will update your end goal date too!,

The App does have the ability to do calorie deficits and contains thousands of foods. It also has the scan feature for store items. Be wary of folks who have put in food items and have calculated the calories incorrectly. This is common on most apps. Maybe on day I will splurge and purchase the upgrade, but for now, I am enjoying the simplicity of this app. Down 10 lbs.",

The only option is to completely delete the account and loose the amount paid for the subscription. Come on Lose It, you can offer better than that. Sometimes we just need a clean slate and fresh start. (Without our former weights showing) Disappointed.",

I also ended up eating the same foods everyday so I wouldn‚Äôt have to track points.   Lose it!  has the exact same functionality as the WW app but counts calories rather than points.   It allows me a much more varied menu than WW and I AM LOSING AGAIN.  It also costs 1/10th of what WW charges for a year.  Very happy with it so far.,

It was a little challenging to figure out at first but now that I‚Äôm on my way it‚Äôs going very well. Both me and my wife use it now and I think just getting an accurate calorie count is vital to consistent weight loss and this app does it well. The scanning feature is very helpful in determining the correct calorie count in the exact foods you‚Äôre eating. I‚Äôd highly recommend this app.,

Disappointed to see pole dancing as a trackable exercise but no bicep curls, lat raises, tricep extensions and other very common exercises. I tried adding Russian twists but it would only allow me to add as duration vs reps. Then I had to know how many calories was going to be burned. If I knew how to calculate my own calories, I wouldn‚Äôt need to track my exercises here. Please add more basic exercises with the option to track both reps and duration.",

I have been using it faithfully for 476 days and have lost 28 lbs.. and still going. The app helps me plan my meals and intake all day long. So I have learned to eat smarter but still enjoy the foods I like. So it is not like I am on a diet. I want to loose another 50 lbs. and with the loose it app I am sure I can achieve it.,

The first time I was at an unhealthy weight and set a goal to get in shape and reach a BMI less than 25. I met my goal by keeping myself accountable to not overeat using this app. When I‚Äôve had some big life changes (injury, newborn kid) that led to some weight gain I have been able to come back to this app to help get me back into shape. -32 yo guy in best shape of my life.",

But this app also helped me further my eating disorder. It let me bring down the calorie maximum to a low number and it didn‚Äôt stop me from making my weight goal underweight for my age, height, and gender. Which is totally my fault but just use this app cautiously because it has no limits for what you can put into it.",
1309,4,2019-06-14T16:03:37.000Z,Mom2Dogs 2nd time,This really works!,"Love this app as it. just. works. You have to be diligent about entering things in real time. Only drawback is that I used this a few years ago & in the basic app they used to include the nutrients breakdown for every meal. In the present app, they made that only available if you upgrade to premium. Daily nutrient breakdowns are available on the basic app, but not shown by meal. I miss that!

The first 3 days were aweful after that  it was plain sailing and I didn‚Äôt feel hungry in between snacks and meals. I drank 80 oz water now drinking 60oz.  Tried uploading photos to the Almased website and wrote a review but the app didn‚Äôt work and couldn‚Äôt upload photos so I‚Äôm writing the review here.

We‚Äôre talking 10 minute boot amp routines. You get a good tracker & personal trainer in one app. For the price I think it‚Äôs amazing!",

It‚Äôs very limited as an exercise tracker but good for counting calories and recording meals. My one gripe is that many of the foods listed on its database have wildly incorrect calorie and nutritional information. I hope the Lose It staff goes through the lists and deletes the inaccurate entries soon: I‚Äôm prediabetic so I need to have accurate carb and sugar counts for my diet.

It was hard to keep track of calories and so easy to lie to myself.  This app is makes it very easy to find and record calories and then to make good decisions about what to eat.

1322,5,2018-01-09T14:58:34.000Z,Neneyoung0,Best healthy living app,I love this App! It links to my phone or watch or Fitbit. It gives me awards and there is a community to get advice or chat with! Best of all I love how you can make your own recipes and save them for future meals with calories and nutrients entered etc. just the free version is great I‚Äôve had it for years and when I‚Äôm able to get the premium I‚Äôd like to since it compares itself to weight watcher (300/yr versus 29/yr)! Great App overall!,
1323,3,2018-02-07T14:59:54.000Z,Scpalways,Too many features are paid features,"I love that this app adjusts calorie intake automatically for weight loss and it‚Äôs easy to use. I‚Äôve never found a food that‚Äôs not in the menu. The thing it lacks is that it locks most of the feautures for the paid premium mode, when most other well-known apps offer these for free with the free app itself. Also, you have to pay an annual membership. If it was a small monthly payment I would probably pay it but I have a hard time doing the annual chunk up front.",
1324,5,2018-04-07T02:33:40.000Z,QueenMaarja,Good helped,"Obviously losing weight is on you as a person, but this app is an immense help with tracking and staying on track. You decide what you eat, but this helps you know how much you should be eating. It may not work the same for different metabolisms and remember it takes time to lose weight. But it did exactly what i wanted it to do. (I do not have the premium. I just have the free version)",

1327,5,2018-05-13T13:18:17.000Z,Bob 17171,Extremely Helpful,I was introduced to this App while on a weight management program at Princeton Medical Center in Princeton.

It‚Äôs helpful but there are a few issues... 1) nowhere for submitting feedback (hence this review) 2) there‚Äôs too much inaccurate and incomplete food data. It needs to have required fields for macros or just save the ‚Äòcalories only‚Äô entries as ‚Äò‚Äômy foods‚Äù with no public access. N/a n/a n/a n/a n/a is useless but shows up again and again for thousands of entries. 3) Sugar alcohols are counted as net carbs. Who does that? That is so basic I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not been addressed. It literally makes the numbers inaccurate.,Thank you for taking the time to let us know what you'd like to see do to make the Lose It! experience better!

However I‚Äôve noticed the calorie and nutrition information is WRONG on many scanned items.  Most recently the honey I scanned was listed at 60calories per TSP when the bottle stated 60calories per TBSP.  I‚Äôve also seen widely varying caloric counts on things like gd beef and chicken, things that are not easily verified by packaging. This can be dangerous for people and really needs to be monitored to clear out bad information. So user beware... take nothing at face value with this app.",

It also connects with Apple heath to notify me on my exercise & daily steps. It helps me not to over do my eating and motivates me when I am eating under my calorie amount! I do wish that the weekly log would start on Sunday‚Äôs & not Monday‚Äôs or at least if it could be changeable. Other than that... no problems!,

I don't/won't pay a monthly fee. And there is an annoying ""one-time"" event that occurs every day when the app is opened. But on the whole, this has been a good way to track calorie intake and I've lost the pounds I targeted.",

The only thing I wish they would add is an option to make food combinations. If I go to chipotle I want to add all of my ingredients to make one meal. Not have 10 different additions for the same thing. Also it would be nice if I could then save that order.,

It counts the percentages of macronutrients  without complications .",

This app does not support integration with apple health to track all nutrients and vitamins as other apps do.  It tracks the main nutrition like fat carbs and protein.  Hoping they can update the app to integrate all nutritional values including vitamins.  If I‚Äôm taking time to log my food I want a full breakdown of my intake.  Until they are able to integrate this feature then it will not be worth the money. If they never update and add this feature I guess I just wasted my money.,

Would have given 5 stars but I believe we should be able to decide if exercise has an impact on our calorie intake. While I can change it on each individual workout, I cannot just change the setting as a whole.  Other than that, it does work very well.",

First they told me to go through iTunes I went to iTunes and they told me it was purchased directly from the website should I go to the website and they tell me it‚Äôs iTunes.,
6952,5,2020-03-06T12:16:27.000Z,üíñsunflowermama,Easy way to own your choices!!!,"Tracking food and fitness has been the tools I‚Äôve used to lose 50 pounds and achieve a healthy BMI!  I have tried several different methods of tracking over the past 40 months. I also have experienced tracking ‚Äúpoints‚Äù many years ago. I am convicted that tracking feels like freedom to a healthy lifestyle. I discovered the Lose It app via word of mouth 3 months ago and was looking for a change from a previous app that was not providing real time data between my calorie burn and my calorie intake. Also I wanted an app that allowed me to add a picture of food to track later if I was in public or at someone else‚Äôs house eating. I wanted to pursue the next level of tracking and remove the last layer of fat if you will to achieve my ideal body and health at the age of 44. I purchased the year subscription and got started. I began by loading one week of my previous tracking data from my old app and started tracking on the Lose It app. I found the Lose It app to be so much easier and user friendly than any of my previous tracking methods I‚Äôve tried. I found it took seconds to add my meal and it is so easy to adjust the portion size based on my food scale measurements. The recipe builder is easy to use and easy to modify for meals created from scratch. I was so excited about the the ease of use, the real time data between my Apple I Watch, my calorie burn, the graphs, stats, badges, and tools of encouragement that I made a commitment to myself that this was going to be my lifestyle. I decided to commit to my health and purchased the Lifetime subscription. I am convinced that health is earned through day to day choices. It is easy to be influenced by others, the culture, events, situations, stress and all the other outside factors that can make health feel so challenging. At the end of the day the Lose It app does an incredible job giving the power of making choices and taking self responsibility for those choices easy and fun! I highly recommend Lose It app. Lose it has helped me lose that last ‚Äúhard‚Äù 10 pounds in only 80 days of consistent tracking.",

6954,4,2020-04-06T15:38:03.000Z,Efffbapp,Lose it,Easy to use has most foods listed. Love to track my calories per day.,
6955,5,2019-12-28T19:39:44.000Z,Kylejallen,Way better than other apps,"This app is amazing even using the free version, and the fee for premium is far less than other apps. It‚Äôs basically the cost of going out to dinner once or twice, for an entire year. USE THE PREMIUM. I didn‚Äôt think it would be worth the functionality, but bought it anyway to support the app since I‚Äôm getting so much use out of it. The premium functions will reveal key information to you. For example, my highest contributor to saturated fat by far was an occasional slice of reduced fat swiss cheese (yikes lol). I was getting way too much sodium from using tuna as a regular protein source. Baby carrots are my best source of fiber, by far better than any whole grain items lol. I thought mini candy canes were no big deal occasionally because of the low calories, but they managed to top the list for simple carbs...and I didn‚Äôt even eat very many of them! It‚Äôs amazing to see this charted out for you, and allows for simple changes to what you‚Äôre eating for big gains to your health. The free version of the app is great as well, extremely easy to use, nice clean uncluttered interface, and easy to chart your calories and macronutrients. Tells you how many calories you have left for the day. Easy to re-enter foods that you eat a lot, since they will pop up at the top of the list in the same quantity as last time (but you can adjust quantity quickly as well). Doesn‚Äôt constantly give you annoying pop-ups recommending premium upgrade like some other apps. I definitely recommend using this, it‚Äôs really worth the small amount of time it takes to enter the foods you‚Äôre eating. You might think you know everything about your diet, but you‚Äôll probably find some new info using this app.",
