0,5,2018-05-07T06:36:58.000Z,doublenickel_55,My macros app,"I’m not much of a review guy.... BUT, I must say I am very happy with this app. I never liked its competitor(s) interface, however I found “my macros” to be very easy and perfect for me. The best part though, is that it has a small business vibe. There has been two occasions were my data has been lost, I’m not concerned with the why. However I’m very impressed with the how, and by how I mean how they resolved the problem. Mind you, I left the account dormant for a couple years, so it’s no surprise that updates happened or whatever else takes place in the app world. All I know, is both times I emailed, and both time Jason himself responded and found a way to correct and reload all of my saved data, much of which was manually input. SO... why?? I don’t know and I don’t care. All I know, is the app is good and nothing’s perfect, but IF there’s a problem I can count on them fixing it. And that’s all I can ask for from any professional. So thank you and yes I love and recommend this app over others.",
1,2,2019-12-12T22:16:32.000Z,Shannondaly,Have to go back to MFP.,"This app is so out of touch.  I eat pretty much the same thing every day, and when I type in egg, I get something like “ famous dans hot dog” ( obviously just an example). I’ve been shocked at some of the suggestions it gives me when searching food. Like HOW! HOW a did you come up with THAT!? I hate the 60 dollar a year price tag for MFP.  But, I have to go back for more accurate accounting of my food.  This is way too much work to custom this, and scan that.  And the scanner. OMG, the scanner.  Come on, people.  Make this work better. I want to live for this app. I just can’t.  It’s too time consuming to log, and half the time the calories are way off.  The most recent thing I logged is 190 on the package. It shows in the app being just over 150 with all of the same macro values, just not the calories values.  And as a fat girl in recovery, this is vital for my own personal success.  I’m not saying be like MFP, but I am saying sort yourselves out.  There’s no reason I should search for one thing, and get a list of 7000 other things that are no where near what I’m looking for.  The positives of this app.   Everything is clear, it’s easy to set your goals, the look of the app is pretty amazing, it’s not cluttered or ugly. It’s a nice looking app, and even despite the search/logging issues. It is fast, and when it’s not a nightmare to try and look for something that you want to add to the list of things you just crammed in your pie hole, it’s a nice app.",
2,4,2019-03-06T02:12:51.000Z,rockisnourishment,The best nutrition tracker I’ve used,"This app is well worth the price if you’re serious about tracking your nutrition. The level of detail and customization available is vastly superior to MFP, and the fact that it tracks net carbs for you automatically is fantastic especially if you’re following a keto diet. The food database is quite sparse, but honestly entering your own food is the best way to be accurate anyway. In reality even though MFP has an enormous database, it doesn’t have access to the usda nutrition database so most of what you find in there is inaccurate. The only problem I’ve found with MM+ is that sometimes the search function in your own favorite foods just stops working, and you have to close the app and reopen it to get it to work again. It’s a quick and simple fix but it’s annoying nonetheless. Also, many times scanning barcodes does NOT yield accurate food information seen on the food label itself. This can at times be painful to modify the food manually to match what the food label shows. Especially if you’re hungry or pressed for time. Hopefully the devs will solve the two little issues, which would make MM+ even better than it already is.",
3,2,2018-01-17T17:10:33.000Z,Amg_10,Frustrating,"As some of the previous reviewers have mentioned, the barcode scanner is hit or miss. I have contacted customer service about this several times but have never gotten the issue resolved. When creating a recipe, and using the barcode scanner, you are unable to filter your results by serving size or brand. The same is also true when creating a recipe and searching for a single ingredient. I have also contacted customer support about this issue, but it has not been resolved and the response was simply that they are working on it. The food database is not comprehensive. I often have to manually enter ingredients or create items which is frustrating and takes a lot of time. As others have also mentioned I, too, feel like I should just switch back to myfitnesspal, but the things that I do you like about this app are that you can adjust your macros by the gram, have different macro goals for different days, or that it also includes more meal options and simply breakfast lunch or dinner. However now that I have gone back to consistently tracking my food after taking six months off and realizing that these issues have not been fixed I am definitely frustrated by the clunky features and the inability of the barcode to work consistently.",
4,2,2017-11-25T22:09:29.000Z,tp2017tp,Not worth the money,"I purchased the app about a year and a half ago, previously being a MyFitnessPal user. The app had a lot of promise seeing as you could use as many meals as you want and set customizable goals. But with the promise of updating a larger consumer database the developers have seriously neglected their customers. I’ve been waiting for months on end for the database to become better and nothing while myfitnesspal has moved past the three strict meals. I strongly regret my purchase and would switch back over to myfitnesspal if I didn’t already log my weights for the past year in this program. It’s been a huge pain to manually enter all my food. An app is suppose to make your life easier, logging food on myfitnesspal with their database takes less then two minutes. While having to manually enter and create a new food item on macros+ can take 5-10 minutes. I find myself using myfitnesspal’s database to create foods on this app, I’ll probably switch back over soon and just bite my ego and take the loss on the purchase and just relog my info when I have the time. If your stuck between the two apps stick with myfitnesspal, this app has been a headache and a half as regular tracker.",
5,2,2017-11-13T16:53:20.000Z,Like!!!!!!!,Not worth the money.,"I have been using MyFitnessPal for years, but wanted something with more customization. I love that this app allows me to set different macro goals for different days, and has more than just the typical three meal set up.",
6,4,2020-07-17T03:00:18.000Z,SSGDaax,Fantastic app with room to grow,"I’ve checked out a couple different macro tracking apps and I find myself returning to this one. Easy to use once you understand the different functions, and I get into a nice rhythm of tracking my food as I am preparing it. The “recent” and “frequent” tabs make for even faster food tracking, especially if you are like me and most of your diet consists of a few staple foods. I highly recommend having a digital kitchen scale, as it takes the guesswork out of weighing/measuring your food.",
7,4,2017-12-06T16:33:30.000Z,Krn2103,Keeps you accountable,It’s a great app for those who know that calories don’t matter as much as macros. It’s simple and easy to use. Food data base is not as large as MyFitnessPal however the more people use it and I use it the database is expanded and a lot more accurate than MyFitnessPal.,
8,1,2019-12-12T03:45:19.000Z,thatxgirlyouknow,I HATE this app!,"I started using this app at the recommendation of my personal trainer. I have used myfitnesspal and the Fitbit food tracker in the past and wasn’t particularly pleased with either of them, but this app is unbelievably, frustratingly worse - and it isn’t free! I thought the barcode scanner would be a nice touch, but even if it can find my food, it never accurately depicts what’s on the label, so I end up having to manually enter everything anyway. And the food database is painstakingly small, even when you create an account and pay for the app. I also hate that unlike myfitnesspal and the Fitbit tracker, you can’t change the measuring unit, and nearly everything ends up in grams. Unless you have a food scale handy literally all the time, you can’t estimate how much you’re eating when you have to measure in grams. And the personalized macro goals the app created for me - which are supposedly the reason why this app is so heralded - were so unattainable, even at the least aggressive setting (e.g. 200 grams of protein per day - I’m not a bodybuilder!) that I ended up setting my own anyway. Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your money on this garbage app.",
9,1,2018-12-29T23:01:56.000Z,Dave Millions,General letdown: rating is due to age,"As most reviews will tell you; this app is a general letdown. It is inflexible in portion selection, it requires you to pay a monthly fee for basic TDEE calculations, the scanner and label reader barely work, and BY GOD is the search awful. I mean, there is literally NO natural language parsing. Let’s say in MFP or MyNetDiary you want to search for some food from some brand. You’d type in “nuggets McDonald’s” and probably get Chicken McNugget as one of the top results. Assuming you had the foresight to type in the proper, exact name of what you want in this app. You can only search the food, then use an antiquated list to navigate poorly to which brand you might want. Even the universal search is pathetic. Worst of all: the support is terrible. I had a log in issue that prevented me from using the app again, which thankfully led me to MyNetDiary in the interim. It took 2 weeks and multiple check ins on my behalf just to get the log in issue resolved. This should have been a 2-3 business day issue at most. Look elsewhere. They keep the old reviews up because they’re from a time when this actually was one of the better macro apps.",
10,5,2017-03-26T19:33:09.000Z,Carochong,Use it everyday!,"I've been using this app for over a year and with each update it gets improved. I love the barcode scanner though sometimes it doesn't recognize the barcode (hello just enter in macros from the nutrition label and it's saved!) the only critical feedback I have for the app is I wish it would calculate changes in nutritional value if you change something from grams/cup/oz/etc to another variable. It would just save time. And for carb cyclers if you could be able to enter different macro goals for the day and it would automatically change your goals for you. Sometimes I forget when my carb load day is (carb depleted brain anyone?) but if I was able to set a schedule for my macro goals it would make my life simple. However that is a stretch for any critical feedback, this app is awesome.",
11,2,2017-07-21T19:23:10.000Z,josarlo84,A lot of potential,I tried this app after trying MyPlate. I like that there is a lot of customization. I also love that I can enter any amount of servings and not be restricted to quarter amounts only.  I love the recipe feature that allows me to create any recipe and reused it.,
12,1,2018-11-30T03:42:28.000Z,n3ot730n3,Very complicated and frustrating to use..,"I’m coming from MyFitnessPal, I was a long time user of theirs but I kept hearing a lot of great things about My Macro+ so decided to give it shot.  First off, this app is extremely frustrating to use, the app has the ability to scan  barcodes, scan nutritional labels but it is usually a hit or miss with more if not all of the labels I have scanned... so guess what that means? You have to spend more time inputting the whole label for the foods you ate.  The app claims that it has over 5,000,0000 codes in its food database that should pick up when you scan an item, but since I’ve gotten the app it can’t even pick up some of the most common brands out there.  Secondly, you already pay 2.99 for the app, the application doesn’t give you the ability to track your macros such as Proteins, Fats and carbs for free, this is a paid feature of the application which makes the application completely useless to me.",
13,5,2019-06-07T06:17:51.000Z,stabbby,Use it everyday,I’ve had this app for a couple years and tracked macros on/off for ... 1.4 years according to the app itself. People have mentioned my fitnesspal (mfp) as a competitor. I’m familiar with mfp and its big database of foods. Does MFP have a larger database? Yes. Is it legit all the time? No. Can you put in exact macros? Not on the free version. Can you change macros per day as in carb cycling? Nope. Is it easy to just GOOGLE the food to find and easily add it instead of complaining? YEP.,
14,5,2019-06-17T19:40:46.000Z,HawaiianKong,Exactly what a macro app should be,"If all you want to do is have a paid-for app that tracks your macros easily, this app is all you need. The database is fine, and the barcode and label scanner work for everything I’ve tried it on. You can set macro goals, and you can see how many grams or what ratios of each you’ve consumed. The app is not bloated with “extra features”. It’s quick, easy, and efficient.",
15,5,2020-12-01T12:48:51.000Z,Esoria_91,Used it for years,"My Macros+ is hands down the best macro app out there and 100% worth every penny. I used to use MyFitnessPal but when I got into fitness and macro tracking, I needed something more. I’ve had this app for years and they keep making it better. Not only that, but their customer service is the best. I switched phones and thought my years worth of data was lost but they were able to restore it over a holiday weekend!",
16,3,2020-10-06T18:50:47.000Z,Mike Donahue,Tracking the amount is cumbersome,"I think that app is good for athletes who weigh all their food, but if you don’t do that there are no default serving sizes for a lot of common foods. Great database with lots of foods and a decent interface but it usually defaults to a single measure like 1 gram. If you meal prep this shouldn’t be too much of an issue.  But it can be cumbersome. I’m not even sure how you would weigh some items like we had corn on the cob the other night. The option was to record grams or ozs. I didn’t  eat the whole cob - just the corn. How do you weight that? Having an option for serving sizes would be nice. A few items have serving size options but not enough. It’s frustrating enough that I’ve moved on to try a new macro tracker. I work with a trainer but he doesn’t use this app to track his clients. I tried almost all the food tracking apps. My favorite stopped being supported a while ago. Great for the athlete but this is not the app I’m looking for.",
17,2,2019-11-05T04:00:39.000Z,MamaSaucy,It needs work,I bought this app because it works with Heads Up but it’s not worth the $2.99 they charge. You have to pay a subscription to use this on any other platform. The macro calculator is garbage. And searching for food items is a pain. I wanted to add “green salad” or even simply a salad but I couldn’t get anything that looked normal to appear. I typed “Roma Tomato” and instead of taking me straight there the app pulled up 100s of results for me to scroll through. Too time consuming. I understand a lot of high reviews are coming from ex-MyFitnessPal and I would agree this is an improvement when it comes to food tracking from that app. But that is where the positives end. Before I tried this I was using Carb Manager and I went back to carb it after this failed my expectations. I’m keto and I pretty much know my own macros but for an app titled as such there’s isn’t much help in figuring out your macros here. You can input a ratio but that’s it. For new people how would they know what their ideal macros should average too?,
18,3,2019-10-07T23:30:51.000Z,Jmelrz47,Search is frustrating,"I downloaded this app to get a more customized experience than MyFitnessPal but I might just switch back. It’s not as user friendly although once you understand the layout and where everything is it’s not too bad (although at the moment I don’t see a place I can track my workout without having to buy another app). The search is pretty terrible. It’s a little slow and it’s hard to find what you’re actually looking for. For example, searching for “honey” the first hit is for a “carved turkey on honey oat.” I searched for coconut aminos and the first hit was “beef aminos” followed by 3 bean turkey chili. The barcode scanning also doesn’t find much of what I’ve tried to scan so far (I use a lot of store brand Trader Joe’s and Wegmans items). It be great if there was a “lite” version of this app as I think I would have liked to test this out before buying. And I’ll probably go back to using MyFitnessPal.",
19,3,2021-06-13T12:14:55.000Z,pencheway,Not for me,"I have tried most of the tracker apps out there. Pretty sure all start with MFP and look to see if we can find something more suited for our goals.  I gave this one a try and can say I found it hard to use. I liked the Marcos being at the top of the screen and that’s about it. I hated the way you have to pick the meal at top before piling all your food into one meal, like I did on day one. I also found the food searches to not be accurate. I made attempt to change the way it searched for food, but no luck. This morning I put in Honey it brought up honey baked ham? I went down the list and way down somewhere in the middle I found honey. So after I few weeks of trying I can say this app is just to hard to use. I believe tracking apps should be quick and intuitive, so can get on with eating. I meal prep for the week so planning a week in as little time as possible is the key for me.",
20,5,2017-07-04T17:31:36.000Z,ksides089,Not a calorie counter,This app is awesome! Super easy to use and navigate. I love that you can follow your friends to create accountability. The barcode scanner is a lifesaver. The update is awesome with more tracking options to keep you aware of what you are putting in your body. I have recently started tracking weight since I will be doing a reverse diet to make sure my weight doesn't fluctuate too much and want to start s tracking water intake as well so that I can become more consistent with that.,
21,5,2018-06-18T15:42:46.000Z,adven.torious,So many great features!,"I have been tracking macros for the 5-6 years and used many Macro Apps in the past. I have yet to find an App that provides so many features. I enjoy being able to create my own recipes, manually log my foods, and look at each of the graphs analyzing my foods. I also like the joined My Workouts+ App. The App developers are also very professional and extremely nice when I sent an email with suggestions for copying/pasting links of websites with my favorite recipes. In addition, I’m wondering if there’s a way we can use our Smart watches, Fitbit, etc and have them sync so we have all of our information available: caloric intake vs caloric output (along with graphs that support this information). Thank you !",
22,5,2018-07-04T02:00:23.000Z,Sklrbçc,Not bad. Could be better.,I’ll start with the good stuff – being able to scan barcodes for basic nutritional information is a wonderful future. And the recipe builder has saved me a lot of time.,"Hi Skirbcc,"
23,3,2019-06-01T20:00:23.000Z,Sentnel,Good app bad database,"This app overall is great, especially the onetime fee allowing you to track your macros. If you go premium it’s cheaper then the other apps as well. It takes a bit to get used to but once you get your favorites in there it’s quick. The barcode scanner is relatively accurate too and it’s rare it doesn’t find the food that way.",
24,5,2019-10-01T13:23:41.000Z,Bongbeee,Best tracking and customer support,I’ve been using this app for 2.5 years now and can’t live without it. I’ve been able to add my own customized recipes and food and have created a pretty hefty database in that timeframe. I updated my iPhone OS a few days ago and thought I lost everything! I tried the download and sync of content which failed. I contacted support and received a reply within minutes and the data was all uploaded back. I was able to download all my personal tracking back.,
25,3,2021-01-21T18:58:26.000Z,Jhiu,Useful yet annoying,The good: this is the best interface for tracking macros. Presentation of information in the charts are really clear and good,
26,2,2019-10-15T16:56:15.000Z,easy530,Food database leaves A LOT to be desired,"Only reason I’m using this is because it tracks macros with more detail than myfitnesspal, but the food database is very inaccurate and it is very difficult to add food. I essentially have to add everything manually or spend 5-7 minutes finding basic things like milk or rice. I’ve decided to go back to myfitnesspal which is just an easier user experience. I’ve been tracking food off and on for long enough to be able to determine how many grams of the big three macros I’ll need each day. Besides, there are many calculators online that do this for free based on your current body weight and activity level. This app’s hassle isn’t worth the small gain of having more visibility to gram tracking in order to avoid myfitnesspal’s subscription. And on that note, if you’ve been inactive on myfitnesspal and/or deleted it for long enough you can get a new offer for a free one month trial anyway.",
27,5,2020-04-17T02:01:13.000Z,🐢✨,"ABOUT TIME MACRO HEAVEN, THANK YOU!","A Macro app that finally doesn’t limit me!!! I can create recipes and my hubby copy it through his app being in my “cycle” making meal planning so so much simpler! Plus we can remind each other to drink protein and tweek meals for each other to hit our goals without needing to voice it. I can just view where he is for the day on the app and vise versa. Along with being able to set custom macros for different types of days “rest days”, “HITT”, and “Power Lifting” making it much more effective to hit training goals and effortless to switch from each setting. I also love the meal reminder. This app is SERIOUSLY the best and I’ve committed to several on pro versions and lets just say none actually allow me to do what I can do on this one. It’s simple, effective, and I love it!!",
28,5,2020-08-19T14:53:48.000Z,ejs0186,Great macro tracker,This app is the first I’ve found that allows for customization of foods down to the gram. For example if I’m entering in granola instead of limiting me to a cup serving this allows to input 64 grams. This is extremely helpful especially when putting in recipes. I was a little hesitant to try this app due to some of the negative reviews but it seems like most of them have to do with this apps ability to search for foods. I find it much more to my liking to enter my own custom foods using the labels or google to find the nutrition facts so the database of this app is irrelevant to me. Another thing I love about this app is that I’m able to connect with my wife on here and we can share meals and recipes so it’s easy to track together.,

This is THE most INEFFICENT set of tracking/exercise apps I have ever used.  I had them once.  Hated them.  Signed up with a Macros Inc coach and tried them again since that’s what they prefer.  Logging water shouldn’t take that many steps.  Logging food is somewhat easy, but not any easier than MFP.  The workout app is incredibly annoying.  It seems like it would be so handy, but really it takes so much time.  HOW in this day in age does it NOT integrate with the Apple Watch?  HOW?!  It won’t let you put in your own calories. You have to “rate” your exercise and try and make it match the calories burned.  I have spent hours of my life the past few days getting these apps preset for logging and such, but wow.  Not something to easily stick to.  I have a free membership to Pro with my Macros Inc membership, but I you couldn’t pay me to use this terrible app combo.  My Fitness Pal all the way.

I love the social aspect so people can follow and I can keep up to date with my clients. I’d like to remove the Diet Coach tab because I won’t use it and it’s really just taking up space. Additionally, why can’t I track my workouts or calories burned with another app? I should be able to include calories burned and not be forced to use the macrosplus fitness tracker. Lastly, what about app themes? Making the application easier to look at will improve people’s desire to use it. Also, water consumption/weight should not be their own tabs..

Paid $2.99 for the app and $1.99 for online service. I really feel cheated. I hope it's just the conversion from one app to another that makes it seem so awful. Never should have paid for this app. Stick with MFP. Sure there are some annoying issues (not being able to put exact Macros), but this app is bare bones at best. I can't even change the serving sizes. So I have to search for someone who input the same amount I want to use which seems like a huge waste of time. I feel duped.

I purchased in order to track macros directly through Avatar and I am so disappointed. The interface is far from user friendly, searches render vast results with nothing to contribute towards what you are actually searching for. I expected to see where I am in my macros to get an idea of where I am and nothing. MFP is superior in this aspect. I believe people are looking for simplicity when it comes to figuring out tracking which is why they sign up for Avatar. Maybe you should take note and not give everyone fatigue in manually entering their foods, I mean looking up coconut oil produced ZERO results for oil but tons for mass produced products with coconut in them. This is a FAIL! The explanation provided by Avatar sold me on something you just don't supply. Please add a screen so we can see the tracking from the info provided once you link the accounts.",

43,2,2017-08-11T18:39:39.000Z,dpelikan,Not better than similar apps,"Oof. This app has some user experience problems. Difficult to find the place to create an account, even though parts of it require an account. Menus are hidden inexplicably behind unrelated menus. Unlike MFP, you can't change the measurement size of the food you searched for? I put one tbsp of flax seed meal in my breakfast, and I'm supposed to enter that in weight, per ounce? Please don't make me have to stare at the back of a package doing math when similar apps just offer a tbsp option. There's a ""Weight"" tab to enter your weight and view a graph to track your weight loss, and there's a ""Weight Loss"" tab, which does nothing but prompt you to download another app. Macro charts and recommendations are impossible to find if you don't know where to look. I'm going to stick with this for a few weeks because it syncs with the Avatar Nutrition site, but I already miss MFP.",
44,1,2019-04-22T10:13:56.000Z,GingerBuki,Grossly Overrated,"This app came highly recommended. I was looking for something to replace MFP that let me get better customization of my macros. I can’t believe I paid for this app that has almost zero functionality. Great I can customize my macros down to the each’s, but I have to enter EVERYTHING else. The barcode scanner works, but almost all of the information was entered incorrectly. The nutrition label scanner almost never works, yet I keep trying. Most recently it told me my creamer was 2 calories but 80 grams of fat 🤦‍♀️ I’ve learned not to even open the database, because google is more accurate if I’m really unsure. And the worst is despite entering something as one serving, when you go to quickly add it to your day, the default is one of whatever the measurement is. Enter one serving as 15g, but quick add will default to one gram. It’s super frustrating and makes me miss the free MFP. Save your money.",
45,5,2021-01-19T15:09:17.000Z,korinnaL,SO Grateful!,"I’ve been using MM+ for a little over 6 months now. I got a new phone last week, I read that I could sync my info to be on the new phone, and then I messed up and clicked then wrong button, which meant losing all of my food entries, data, etc. Safe to say, I cried but then sucked it up and said I’d just start over. Someone in a macros group on Facebook recommended I reach out through the app, and while skeptical, I did. I am SO GRATEFUL that I did!! MM+ was able to get my data from their end, and once they had it, all I had to do was sync it correctly! All of my stuff was back, and I was quite happy. I love good customer service, and MM+ definitely exceeded it! Thank you! It’s greatly appreciated.",
46,5,2020-04-19T02:12:37.000Z,sshults0527,Great Support,I recently got a new phone and when I downloaded the app and logged in none of my meals/food was transferred over to my new phone. The app has a sync feature that means you should be able to use multiple devices to track and I couldn’t get it to work. I emailed their support email and the problem was solved in less than 24 hours. I’m so thankful that all my data was saved and that they took care of it on a weekend no less. I also think you get so much more on this apps one time payment version than any other app I’ve seen. You get way more for a one time payment of $2.99 than you do for the free version of MyFitnessPal. Love this app!!,

When the day ends, and see that my numbers approximately match my goals I calculated using the app, I feel so accomplished and satisfied, I don’t feel starved.",
48,3,2020-12-25T12:41:34.000Z,DianeL123,Ok app,"I’ve tried all the macro tracking apps and generally like this one. I like that you can go to a meal and pick from a list of your most frequent foods logged for that meal which saves a lot of time. I wish that the brand of the food was listed in the preview. I thought that the “categories” of food would be from the custom foods I added and assigned to a category, but my custom food categories don’t seem to be accessible from anywhere. The foods by type and by brand are the app’s database, a lot of it is restaurant food and I don’t eat most of those things. Also, I realize this app is for tracking macros but I wish that the micro nutrients were also tracked. I also think it would be a great feature if recipes found online could be imported instead of having to do it manually.",
49,3,2021-02-11T16:13:16.000Z,JDeeds21,Pros and Cons but prefer over MFP now,"It’s great i no longer have to do math to enter my servings (previously used MFP) but there are a few annoyances. I wish the meal orders would stay in a specific order and I wouldn’t have to rearrange them chronologically every day since I pre-log certain meals first. I also wish the database of foods was bigger. I understand it’s more accurate to enter our own data, however sometimes when eating out or having dinner cooked by someone else, it’s difficult to log and estimate those meals because many foods aren’t listed anywhere. For that I end up referring to MFP.   The app also crashes frequently, especially when changing macro goals. There are also some foods from the Macros Inc. brand that when favorited, will not show up in my custom list.",
50,3,2017-05-02T13:11:41.000Z,Patboss10,HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL,"Overall, it's a great app(I'm looking at potential). I love that it allows you to categorize way more than MFP(pre workout, etc), but the search needs to be upgraded BADLY. I'm a personal trainer so I'm thinking more for my clients that have no idea how to really measure and track. The barcode scanner hardly ever picks up anything(I'm eating normal mass produced food), and when you search you have to write EXACTLY what you're looking for and it still won't find it some times(e.g you can't look up eggs because nothing comes out, I have to literally type grade a large egg and start looking.)",

I looked into meal plans and such. Then I came across the study of macronutrients.",
52,5,2017-09-28T03:52:56.000Z,Rowan1776,Amazing app with a few bugs,"I love how the app functions and have zero complaints about how you use the app. I use this app and its workout tracker counter part to track all my nutrition and fitness data. The only thing is that mymacros+ doesn’t sync its nutrition data correctly with Apple health. When I go into the Apple heath app it doesn’t display the correct amounts of my macro nutrients and will display protein amounts in the 10,000g/day range. I’m running IOS 11 on an iPhone 7plus. Hopefully this gets fixed soon. It would also be cool if the myworkout+ app exported estimated calories burned data to Apple health based on age, weight, height, and body fat.",
53,5,2018-06-02T17:15:04.000Z,Agatka_Valentina,FAR BETTER Than My Fitness Pal,It’s not even close. For those who have the desire to accurately track their macros/micros this App is the best. I was so fed up by the mathematical errors and just flat out missinformation on MFP that I had to look elsewhere and I did not want to back to manual spreadsheets. Look no further! It’s worth the price for full functionality as well.,

My entire database disappeared for some inexplicable reason during an iPhone update and I was devastated. It took my 4 years to build my food library and the mere thought of trying to rebuild was daunting.  Sent a message to the support team and although it took about a week to restore (they were as baffled as I) Jason and team got to the bottom of the issue and restored. Very grateful to everyone on the team for their help!  And so appreciative of how this app has evolved over the years. So user friendly and makes searching, scanning and recording a breeze!!!

So, getting back in the habit of tracking my macros I downloaded it again. This go around however, the app has gotten horrible. I don't mean the interface necessarily, just that its food data and basic math are atrocious. First off it can't accurately give me the macros for baked boneless, skinless chicken breast... I tried to modify the data to match every other source out there but it wouldn't work. As far as basic math skills, I put the exact same items in for my breakfast, scanning a few barcodes that didn't result in the correct data, ( which I was able to change to match the items label), then the total for my breakfast ended up being like 15 calories higher than in actuality. This version of the app terrible so back to MyFitnessPal.",

This app has been an essential tool for me for meal planning and understanding exactly what to eat at each meal and snack to meet my daily macro goals. I like that I’m able to save and apply different macro templates to each day for easy carb cycling. Adding and modifying custom recipes is also really easy. I reached out this morning about a feature that was missing from the latest update, and their development added it back within a couple hours. I’m impressed.

The tracker for water is wonderful for reminding me to drink enough water. The export option allows me to email her my entire week so she can make adjustments if needed (and keeps me accountable). The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is that it doesn’t sync to my Apple Watch for activities and the workout partner app that accompanies this one if you choose is limited on the accuracy of workout options with no customization. Great app MM+ is user friendly and greAt for accountability (I like visual charts) so for any data geeks it’s a must!",

Can I just plan a weekly meal plan and then copy and paste it day to day? Nope, have to put it in a day (whether I eat it that day or not), then copy and paste it each day I want to use it. Can’t do a week plan and then adjust, who has time for this. Pretty much remember what day I ate that meal and go back to it. Ridiculous. Food list is propagated with the same items 20 times over, for example Hunts tomato paste, over and over and over. Put in “tomato” and there’s no smart sorting between a fresh tomato or tomato as an ingredient. What is supposed to set this apart from MFP? Pretty much just the cost. Can’t believe anybody is rating this app with anything over 3 stars. And that’s being generous.",

MyMacro+ let me set up different macro-goals for different days, it gives me very quick synching between my phone, iPad, Mac and PC, and so far I have not had any trouble with any platform I use. The barcode reader works well, and there are lots of helps to make you think your most frequent or favorite food and meals quick and adapt other entries as best for you. Go for it - and just do the upgrade right away, you get A LOT for a very small cost.",
61,3,2017-07-26T13:28:24.000Z,Iteach6g,It's okay. . .could use improvements.,"There are some parts of the app that I like, but the part I can't get past is the library of foods.  It's a mess.  A lot of brands I type in aren't in there and they aren't off brands.  Also, when you do type stuff in, a ton of the same foods pop up and they are unverified.  It pointless to have to sift through 30 foods that are all the same.  That needs to be cleaned up. Additionally, if you type in coconut oil, there's is nothing.  You type in oil, nothing pops up.  No Kerrygold either.  So if you're looking to use this to log macros for the Keto diet, look somewhere else. I had to uninstall this app.  The macros app with an apple on the icon is way better and it's the same price.",

Everything that I have needed to track that I could not track before in other apps I can do it here. I can add custom recipes, rename them, put them on a different day, add notes to them, and get a meal reminder. I can even add custom meal names so that I really know what I’m tracking instead of trying to force it to fit in standard categories like other apps.  What more can a girl ask for?  Now if I could just have this app to do my cardio for me I would be all set😄!",

For every need you have to make another purchase! The database is soooo small but also full of duplicate entries made by users with no verification or guarantee that the macros are accurate! Furthermore there are so many days I don’t feel like going to google or MyFitnessPal to find the nutrients so I tried using the website but you have to be subscribed to one of their monthly subscription in order to use it which is free on MyFitnessPal. The concept that this is focused on serious users is amazing, but it’s user experience shows that it was created to take advantage of that said market not actually help 🤷🏽‍♂️",
64,1,2020-06-29T18:00:54.000Z,ProductiveAppAddict,Frustrating,I like the app but it has dumb issues. The food database is confusing to sort through and contains random brand junk food but not quality brand food from Whole Foods. The portions are a mess. It’s such a pain to use that I have to customize all my food. What idiotic programming. I can’t even search for a banana. I keep coming back to this app since I bought it but I think I’ll abandon it if there is a better app out there which there sure may be by now since I got this 4 years ago. Also I have to shot the app down completely to get it to reset to a new day. If you search for a lemon it will first give you results you dint want such as 30 versions of 1 gram. It will never give you calories of a lemon. Instead it will give you results to lemon pie. Terrible food database. Terrible the worst on the AppStore.,
65,5,2021-03-02T18:50:16.000Z,Laurenbens,The best!!,"This app is the best, hands down. The only thing you need to do to make this app successful and 100% accurate is to make your own entries for everything, which is honestly what you should be doing on ANY nutrition app (looking at you MFP users). The database entries aren’t going to be correct, neither is the barcode scanner. But once you get the hang of making your own entry it takes less than a minute. I’ve been using this app for 8 months and have lost almost 30 pounds. Make your own entries, get a kitchen scale, weigh in grams (not tablespoons and cups), stick to it, and enjoy results!",

However, it is fundamentally unusable. When using the barcode scanner feature to log food, almost everything is inaccurate. I would estimate that 9/10 items I scanned were entirely wrong. In addition, the units were often incorrect or nonsensical. If you try to search for items (even items that are clearly in the database, based on the inaccurate barcode scans), it shows no results. The entire purpose of this app is to help people accurately track their food consumption. Without accurate data, it is essentially useless. I tried to get a refund, since the app doesn’t work as advertised, and it was denied. Very disappointing app and customer service.",

The search tool seems low in pre-loaded items you can find. For instance, Starbucks only shows one drink when I search the brand. The barcode scanner definitely makes up for it though! Also, it'd be nice to be able to apply different macros for different days rather than having to switch it for the entire profile (rest day vs. active days).

While setting everything up I thought I made the right choice until I started using the food tracker. Like everyone here, the barcode was good for me but barely worked for my Wife’s phone. As I tried to input serving size data, NONE of the information matched. The more I edited it the more the calculations were wrong. I tried putting in serving sizes like cups, ounces, etc. and it was like it didn’t know how to compute it. Then, I put it down after frustration, closed it out and tried again the following day with the exact same results and even worse, it wasn’t even saving to my food log.

Why can’t you give me one week free trial?? After downloading I realized it was a bit confusing but figured over time and use that I could figure the app out. I have decided rather quickly that I don’t like this app mainly based on the fact that I cannot find a single food item?! I mean I couldn’t even find a Starbucks drink?! Starbucks!! I searched on every part of the word with or without Starbucks in the search and I could not find it. This is just one example. I can search via MyFitnessPal app and find things almost immediately.

Then I realized you don’t know it’s right unless you enter it yourself anyway. So I gave it two weeks and started entering my foods and now I could never go back. No more guessing which entry is the best because it’s myyy entry. This app really forces you to do that but it’s a good thing. Then the way everything is laid out is much more intuitive and easy to read. No more going to a different page to see how much more protein I should eat. Love this app.,

Only minor complaint is that the list of foods in the database isn’t as comprehensive, but once I’ve gotten my regular and favorite items entered in I use those all the time from my favorites list.

However, the search is AWFUL. I feel like I have to enter each food manually- even basic produce! I will search “watermelon” and be given 300 results of watermelon flavored things, but no actual plain watermelon. The barcode scanning is also frustrating. It’s hardly ever actually accurate and I end up manually entering all nutrients again. I wish there was at least a base library of whole foods that was ACCURATE and that scanning worked, especially since I paid for the app.",

It’s organized by macros and if I track a food I won’t eat again or was a one off I can delete it off my recents making it easier to find my foods that I use all the time. I like how you can convert the measurements and how it’s so simple. I think it would be cool to add fun things to do with your macros like carb cycling or reverse dieting.

If the app could sync with the iPhone exercise tracker, that would be ideal or find a way to simply input exercise (broad categories like cardio, weight training, etc. and level) to give you a better idea of calories burned everyday.  Other than that-this app is awesome!  Absolutely love it!",
87,5,2019-11-06T19:45:00.000Z,nikkissaw,Perfect for Macro counting,"I tried MFP first because it seems like everyone uses that but I didn't like it at all, I thought it was confusing and not user friendly. My Macros is the exact opposite, it's easy to use, it makes sense and once you get a solid list of favorites going it only takes a few seconds to input your meal information. I love how it shows me the F, C & P breakdown for each meal, it shows me the total I've consumed so far, the amount I have left as well as what my daily totals should be. I can track my weight too!",

89,3,2020-08-31T15:59:27.000Z,Lbracklein,Cumbersome,"I’m a tech literate person who finds this app a bit cumbersome. If you eat a lot of pre-packaged food you should be fine. You can just scan the barcode. But if you’re trying to eat a healthy, natural foods diet it’s tough to find what you’re looking for. For example: I put peach in the search and it returns dozens of possibilities, only one of which is an actual raw peach. That choice is in cups of slices, yet I want to put in weight. Hard to believe I can’t get the macros on a peach by weight! I’m constantly having to get on the computer to find macros to enter in if I want to be accurate. Someone needs an app that isn’t geared for people who East out of a box.",
90,5,2017-11-28T20:28:24.000Z,Hellolaurenzo,Super Buggy and search is useless,"I literally can’t find anything I type in, even with global search turned on. I have to scan everything if I need to add it and sometimes I don’t always have the product. App has a ton of bugs, coincidently also while searching. First item is hidden by Serving Size and Brand filters, once an item is selected it’s pretty much frozen till you hit the back button. Cannot multi select when searching for items.",
91,5,2018-11-25T22:44:09.000Z,Thesenicknamethingsarestupid,Necessary tool,"Whether you're trying to lose, gain, or maintain weight - I would recommend this app hands down. It's extremely flexible and very user friendly. I really appreciate that it tracks and reports more than just calories and delves into fat, carbs, and protein. There's also a feature that lets me set different macro goals for different days. Like any tool, it takes discipline to use - but I highly, highly recommend it.",
92,1,2019-05-10T00:32:57.000Z,EricaDS,Looks nice but not as functional as I would like,"The food database is very strange. If I want to look up a certain brand of something, it shows SO many unrelated things. For example, Stonefire Naan Dippers (like small pita wedges, resulted in apple dippers, chicken dippers, etc. Even using the option to narrow it down by brand didn’t work because the brand was spelled incorrectly. Search parameters that contain only what you enter would be helpful as I’ve never had this issue with any other food database in any other app. Further, it doesn’t let you change the type of serving. For example, angel hair pasta was something like a 3 inch long 2 diameter portion. You should be able to switch to ounces or something you can measure out after cooking.",

I have been using this App for 2yrs after trying a few other tracking Apps. This one is by far the Best!!!  Recently an update to the app was made (always for the better) and I could not figure out how to copy my meal to the next day, silly me!  I emailed them and received a response with the information I needed the same day.  It is really hard to find great Customer Service / Support now days.  Thank you My Macros Team!!!!",

I switched my phone over and they sent me step by step with screenshots guide to upload my data to my new phone. Phew I thought I lost it all!! But app I would give 4.5 stars. Technological improvement - I miss the “x” next to the metric (so you can delete “grams” with one click as opposed to a delete each letter) like you used to have. Maybe have suggest recommended “grams” based on trends of same food eaten, etc.",

Overall it’s not too difficult to type in your macros, however I would love if the app would take accept a saved picture or screenshot. Currently you can take a picture of a nutritional label through the app and it will input the numbers in for you., The problem is sometimes I have to search online for a label and think it would be so much easier if I could use a screenshot to add macros rather that going back and forth between windows.",
96,3,2021-02-14T00:34:22.000Z,iLikeiTunes2,Great Features,"I purchased this app because I wanted the ability to have macro goals that change throughout the week. I like that I can set custom macro goals and apply them to whichever days I choose. I like being able to add custom meal names. The only thing I don’t like about the app is that the database of foods is very limited. There is a barcode scanner to use and even a nutrition label scanner, but these are not always accurate and I often opt to enter my foods manually. However, once I enter these, they are saved. Most of my foods are in my “recents” tab for easy access. Overall, the app serves my needs.",
97,3,2020-02-23T20:39:10.000Z,Kf from MN,Pretty Good,"Im a bodybuilder on competition prep. This app is pretty good, I like that I can set specific macro goals, not limited to percentages like the (non premium) competitor App. Easy to preset macro targets and set those targets for specific days. My issue is: Not particularly user friendly when it comes to searching for foods. Example: simply searched “grapes” and result was such a weird list...  “apples and grapes” “cheese and grapes” “tea, grape.” Would be helpful if there was some kind of algorithm to push more sensical options to the top of the list. I think search results are alphabetized, which is counterintuitive in my opinion. Still generally like the app though.",

99,2,2019-08-31T18:32:05.000Z,mikkinpt,Not really worth it,"The number of selections for food for this app is limited. Perhaps the app still needs time and contribution from users to get up to speed. Ive used other apps that are free that does what this app charges you to do. At the end of the day, its simply not worth purchasing this app when there are other apps that can do the same function for free. The other app i now use has almost every food items i can think of, from specific types of sandwiches from several restaurants to some obscure asian dish. This one app? It will help you track macros on simple ingredients like if you just eat an egg...wish i never spent my money on the app",
100,5,2017-03-24T03:10:44.000Z,Kenzringo,way better than mfp,"My favorite features of this app are that 1. You can enter your own macros, and switch days when you have high carb days and low carb days (love!) 2. I love that you can edit nutrition information on foods you search. In mfp you have to look through multiple options and if that doesn't work out, you have to create your own entry. Saves a lot of time.",
101,2,2017-07-09T21:59:40.000Z,shamusmccrackin,Tedious,"I've used MyFitnessPal on and off over some years when dieting, but decided to give MM+ a shot after getting on Avatar Nutrition so I didn't have to constantly adjust my macros on MFP. MM+ is just not as easy to use. It's hard to find foods in the database, even very common ones, and even the barcode scanner will often bring up incorrect info and I wind up having to enter it all in myself. It's convenient to have my macro and calorie goals already in the system, but other than that, it's mostly frustrating to use. I'm continuing to use it and hoping I will get the hang of it, but it's so far just made me not keep up with tracking.",
102,2,2017-10-18T12:22:44.000Z,BMAN WELLS,Limited but has potential,"The concept is there. Partial functionality is there. Unless you eat packaged foods or at restaurants all the time, you will still need another macro book. This does NOT have raw, fresh foods calculated. So if you are some broccoli, you will have to look up the nutrition unless it was green giant frozen broccoli. Are a fresh chicken breast? Again, not in the app. I have a macro book but was wanting the app for simplicity and to ditch my notebook records and go electronic. It’s actually more time consuming to use this app with the lack of foods in the program. Like I said, if you eat out or get pre packaged foods and not fresh produce and meat items, you will probably like it.",
103,4,2018-05-17T03:49:50.000Z,New To IPhone (330),Most Intuitive Macro App,A great app for Macro focused tracking. Your macros are prominently displayed at the top while showing amount left throughout the day. Very intuitive for me. I switched over from MyFitness Pal for this reason.,

The databank can be a little lacking, but the ability to enter custom foods and recipes means you can account for just about anything you eat if you want to. The recent and frequent food options are super convenient. It may seem tedious to enter a lot of foods at first, but once you build a library of foods you regularly consume this app really shines.",

I think “serving size” and “serving name” need to be changed to amount and unit because so many people get it wrong. But, I love that once I make my own, I know exactly what I’m eating and it makes it totally easy to track and you can customize what you see for each meal and the meal names (as many as you need)! I’ll never use any other macro app again!",
106,5,2020-02-16T04:43:25.000Z,TdAnder,Only Missing One Thing,"Firstly, the things I love about this app. It is by far the best looking nutrition tracker on the store. The interface is easy to navigate and the macros are displayed appropriately. It is as close to perfect as you can get except you thing. The data base is so far behind MyFitnessPal that finding foods without the label scanner is super hard. If you eat the same things over and over though - it does save recent items and it becomes much quicker.",
107,5,2019-09-01T00:38:13.000Z,Linda102302,Great support,I have used this app for over a year and I love it. I bought a new phone and all of my data including every recipe I built and every food I logged was gone. I emailed the support team and they answered within a day and after a little back and forth got all of my data back. Super responsive and quick fix! Definitely worth the one time fee for the app that lets you customize/change your macros without a monthly fee. Thanks Jason!,
108,2,2020-06-23T23:06:19.000Z,Lukie1009,Not worth the $3,"This is not a good app. I’m really surprised it has as high a rating as it does. The database of foods is awful. The serving sizes are so far off it makes it nearly impossible to use. The barcode scan does a generally good job of finding the correct food but it somehow manages to pull up incorrect nutritional information. I thought it was a great idea to be able to edit food information but once edited it won’t let you save the changes!  The only thing I like about this app is the ability to customize your macro amounts. Overall, I’ll be finding a new macro counter. Doing it on paper would be better then this app!",
109,1,2019-09-11T19:58:58.000Z,Elevenses11,Big step backwards!,"Latest version includes interface changes that degrade usability. For starters, the food item name and amount are now on the same line with very little room for the amount. So if the amount is more than a few characters, the only way to read it is to open the food edit screen which at least has a ""Back"" button to cancel. Most other screens force you to swipe down. If you're aim is off you end up in the iPhone Notification Center. I could go on -- especially the bad changes on the weight screen -- but the bottom line is nearly every cosmetic change in the version makes it harder to use. Please change it back!",

Unless you're willing to pay $10 a month for premium MFP (I'm not), then this is so much better. The food entries are so much more accurate and you're not over-inundated by hundreds of incorrect entries, and it is so awesome to see where you stand at all times with your macros right at the top of your screen. I love it! It took some getting used to but it's been awesome.",
111,2,2017-08-03T23:18:45.000Z,Jzazo17,"Okay, but the search is horrible","This app is not bad. I like that it syncs with avatar nutrition (if you use that) and the macro display is helpful. However, the search is pretty awful. More often than not, I have to manually enter in a food and find myself Googling nutritional facts. Further, it does not ""remember"" frequently used goods in the search function. I believe this is extra per month. The barcode scanner works most of the time, but not nearly as well as MyFitnessPal. Overall, it would be way better if they improved the search and you didn't have to manually add so many basic foods such as bananas, onions, etc.",
112,5,2018-08-11T20:24:06.000Z,Tara_T,Great macro tracker!,I switched to my macros plus from MyFitnessPal because I wanted an app where I could see the macros more easily at a glance. This app does just that. I like how at each meal you can see the macro breakdown so you can stick to a certain amount of grams per meal. I also like how there are options of having goals for more than one day-perfect for low and high calorie days.,

The total calories for the day don’t ever add up, and are always under.

The app is simple to use, intuitive and information is provided about what you’re eating in multiple ways (the pie chart is a great feature). Being able to add and save custom foods and adjust amounts as needed really makes the macro life easier. There should be more food categories though— fish, beef, non-dairy.

So far I like the app but I wish the tracking water and exercise was on the today, yesterday section or at least make it under the tracking food menu and not under settings. To me not having in your face makes it seems like the developers to think it is as important. Also a lot of people are about of sight out of mind and if it isn’t in their face they won’t remember to do it. I will give the app a little more time hopefully improvements will be made.",
117,3,2019-09-11T03:07:30.000Z,whispering wallaby,Great functionality but lose manual nutritional info,I love how easy this app is to use. I’ve used it on and off for about 4 years now and it’s great except for one thing. Every time I’ve switched phones or updated the app I’ve lost all my manually added nutritional info. If your really serious about counting macros you want to know your info is correct so you add a lot of stuff yourself. To lose that information and all the saved recipes that make counting calories super easy is a massive headache to re-enter every time. If that issue were fixed I’d give this 5 stars.,

It’s just stupid now. You pay $2.99 for what is a very basic app, which does absolutely nothing worthwhile, when you really need to be paying $1.99 a month to be able to actually count macros. This developer really needs to offer a free 30 day trial of what is really a subscription based service...but they won’t, because they know this. There are much better apps out there, and even the free version of My Fitness Pal is better. The developers need to do MUCH better than this.",

I’ll type in “honey” in the search bar and  the most random things pop up like “honey wheat bread”  or cereals etc. i switched over from MFP because i just wanted to have a different mind sent, but i can see why they are rated far above this one.

It would be great to connect to the iOS health app, no Polar Flow, no Fitbit, no Garmin, in short no connections everything is manual. Nowadays, there are a plethora of Bluetooth scales which interact with other apps of this category. Here in Macro + inputting weight is also a manual process. Of course all this is solved by taking advantage of the health iOS API’s it’s a bit disheartening to have a great app sort of sabotage by missing basic features like steps counted, exercise calories and more.",

139,1,2019-10-08T16:56:02.000Z,BostonBikeGal,Database is Non Existent,"I signed up for MM+ only because I’m working with a coach who syncs to it. I’ve used MFP and LoseIt and MM+ by far has the worse database of all the apps. For example, I tried searching for an English muffin this morning and one from a restaurant came up. It is easy to scan your food but if you’re searching for a fresh food or an item off a menu be totally prepared to input it manually. The interface is nice graphically but the $19 premium is NOT worth it as nothing loads and works online. But really for me, ease of use and ability to track quickly are key and the lack of foods in the database makes this app horrible.",

It's straightforward, had a myriad of ways to input your meals (be it through search, manual entry, or barcode scanning). Entering notes & adding favorite meals makes it much easier to personalize. Best feature: definitely the different goals you can save and set. So now I can meet my macros on gym AND rest days! Super helpful and user friendly app.",

Logging food with this is time consuming and frustrating with so many duplicate or wildly inaccurate entries.  Plenty of foods came up with no macro information, just zeros or ""non."" Good luck if you go to a buffet and try to manually search for foods.  Some of the bar codes worked, some didn't.  I also did not like the layout of the tabs - confusing. $2.99 down the drain, going back to MFP.  They have better data, better user interface, and macro breakdowns as well.",
142,1,2017-08-12T16:29:04.000Z,Glorygiver,Terrible search results,"This App could be great for tracking macros but the search results make you want to give up on life. It makes me more frustrated than an Amish electrician. The search results have almost no connection to what was searched. Don't pay for the app. Stick with MFP. For more specifics, I searched for a ""Maple Bacon Donut"" (a fairly common donut) only to see results for maple bacon. I decided to search for ""Maple Donut"" an even more common donut especially from Dunkin Donuts to see no results of it but a bunch of peanut butter results that had hardly any correlation. I then went in MFP and searched for ""Maple Bacon Donut"" and guess what?! The results came up for Maple Bacon Donuts!",

But trust me, don’t buy it unless you have a lot of patience and a lot of free time. It takes a very long time to add food, adjust serving size, change units, etc. Most of the time you can’t even be positive it’s correct because food is measured in grams, and I’m obviously unable to carry a scale around with me everywhere I go. Even at home I’m not weighing my burger/salad/pasta/avocados. It’s not user friendly and way over complicated. I feel like it would be easier to just keep a hand written log instead of buying this.",

Well, I rarely found the information correct if the database did find the brand item I was looking for. And maybe it was user error but I couldn’t even find the correct numbers for simple things like a bell pepper.",

It’s not user friendly (very confusing how to navigate through the app), but I can get past that. The final straw is the actual tracker. When scanning items to add to my tracker, I tried to change the serving sizes (1 gram of butter is minuscule) and it won’t adjust the fat, carbs and protein for the new serving size. I have no idea what I’m actually tracking and how I’ve ended the day. Wish I didn’t spend $3 on this app. Waste of money, especially compared to all of the free options.",

This was such a huge gift. Interface is clean and clear...unlike other tracking apps I've tried. And it caters to people like me who measure things by grams.

If anything it makes me track less often because I can’t search for specific items and there are few “verified items” in the data base. I’ve been using MyFitnessPal for 2 years and it might be less organized and not a clean but at least I can find things easily. My gosh.,

I like it because it doesn’t shove adds in my face, but like all apps they have certain areas that are only available to subscribers. The app is pretty basic, but if you want to just track your calories then it works. It does lack a lot of food, but if you’re okay imputing it once yourself it’s no big deal. I will say the Apple Watch app for logging water does not work for me. When ever I try to log water it crashes, which is a bummer.",

The only reason I went back was the search function just is better on MFP. There is a major lack of verified items and exploring restaurants and even finding nuggets at Wendy’s is tough and there are so many variations people have made. If you have the time to type in everything and not rely on search, this app is better than MFP in terms of detail etc.",

I definitely think there’s some issues with the database, and, at this time, that makes this app unusable for me.",

I do like how this app tracks my macros and the layout of the meals I’ve eaten, but the functioning is terrible. Currently, the app isn’t even working. I click on the app, it pops up for 1 second, then crashes and goes back to my home screen. For a paid app, I am SO disappointed as I know free apps work better.",

However, I have a really difficult time finding foods to add for meals and/or recipes. For example, it was very difficult to add an entry for honey - even with the global search.

Only negative is I wish I could enter my exercise/activity for the day on the same screen and not have to go into a separate  app. Wish I had this in my life 20 yrs ago!,

Unlike other apps, when you scan a barcode you have to double check that the nutritional information that shows up is correct ... which I promise it won’t be. For myself, this has added much frustration to counting macros... which is a pain in itself.  I can’t said I would recommend this app .",

Even with a backup to the cloud and other devices, all info does not transfer, had to re-apply macro goals, weight progress, and custom meals. Very frustrating and annoying.",
209,4,2020-04-15T00:33:34.000Z,TooXFit,Easiest way to track as a client and a coach,The only reason I don’t give this 5 starts is because the food options available I feel are a little limited. To overcome this I look up nutrition. Information and very easily plug it in to my journal. This app makes everything from coaching to adjusting macros. To managing and tracking your macros insanely easy.,

When bulking it feels really odd to be overeating but this handy app keeps me calm!  It does have some bugs: syncing between devices sometimes and cutting and pasting a prior meal into today sometimes sticks it into wrong day.  And being I live in Europe it doesn't always see my barcodes. All in all- a solid 4 star,

I get subscriptions that enhance and give extra features, but just setting a baseline macro for a macro app should be included, especially if you have to pay for the app. Also the good nutrition stored in this app is very poor and some of the items aren’t even in there, like raw tomatoes. Unless your talking about anything from a restaurant, it’s not in there.","Hi TheBwii29, really sorry for the confusion but you can set your macro goals for no extra charge than just the paid app price. Go to the ""Set Nutritional Goals"" settings page and hit ""Add Goal Profile"". Then you can enter in your macro goals in grams, no extra subscription required."

BUT, the “forced” calorie got your back option is kind of stupid. This should be an option to turn on/off. Not something forced on the user.

This is normal because I usually add a lot of custom foods to this app. The app decides to lower the calories to 423 no matter what I try. I try to update how many calories are in the food and the app doesn’t change a thing about the meal when I’m done updating. I’ve made sure I’ve clicked update food when I’m don’t but nothing works. This is a rule breaker for me and I’ll have to switch to MyFitnessPal if the issue persists. Can I get some help on this situation?,

When I search for a food there are often many duplicates and they're sometimes different units, or not units that we typically eat. Maybe creating my own database is the way to go.

I’ve tried to put in red potatoes for a meal and it will not show up under the meal and doesn’t subtract the calories, protein or anything from my totals but if I try to add it again it acts as if it’s already been inputted. Overall too many issues for not being free.",
278,2,2019-10-29T14:51:43.000Z,Mr.Creepy345,Nutrition Goals No longer work,Hi! I loved this app and use it every day to track my weight however after the recent update you can no longer create a new nutrition goal profile via nutrition calculator because the activity level option doesn’t work. When you click on it it does nothing. This now makes it impossible to create a new goal/macros and track your goals.,
279,5,2021-03-11T13:14:32.000Z,nasa41,Great app but there is a learning curve!,This app is great and has tons of features for tracking your dietary and fitness goals. It does take a little bit of time to figure out how to use all these features but it’s fantastic once you do.,
280,3,2017-06-09T06:53:15.000Z,aznspike,Eh. Could be better and free app can do more,Cant track some of the stuff. Tried to put 160grams of chicken and it wouldnt let me and didnt gave me an option go do it. It just had per piece and that was it. Tried to custom my own meal by putting in all the info and still wouldnt give me an option for oz or grams. Everything cant be measured by per piece or pieces cuz it weighs different.,

290,5,2017-04-02T17:04:41.000Z,Magic01,Great App,This app fits my style way better than MFP. I can set the exact macros rather than have something try to set it for me. It isn't so much for someone looking for something to tell them what to eat. You have to figure that out somewhere else.,

There is a barcode scanner available when just searching for food. But if I am making a recipe, it takes FOREVER to find the correct items in my recipe. They need to incorporate a barcode scanner in the recipe search bar as well. It would help making recipes soooo much easier and more accurate.","Hi .

304,3,2018-04-15T16:36:18.000Z,Jlynna26,Food library not as good as other free apps,Food library is not as good as other apps that are free and it’s annoying that you can’t just add a custom food without putting in the entire recipe. So for example. You can’t add “Mexican egg scramble” or whatever and enter in the nutrition info without actually creating the recipe and putting in every ingredient. App is just ok,
305,2,2019-01-22T01:13:48.000Z,Aresnaut120,Not what I thought,"This had a coach, and calculator, that if you pay an additional 10 bucks a month you can use. So I just paid 3 bucks for the app, and it won’t even calculate my macros that I should be eating, unless I do a 7 day trial that will most like turn into me paying $10, because it won’t get cancelled correctly or until after the due date. Not what I was looking for.","Hi Arsenaut, Sorry for the confusion but the nutrition calculator is completely free, no extra charge. Macro Coach is our artificial intelligence powered macro coaching system which is an optional in app purchase, but the nutrition calculator is fully included."
306,5,2020-01-22T17:47:48.000Z,Zyxw432149164,Not happy with this updated version,The older version was easier to maneuver... you could copy a meal from day to day without having to copy the whole day and then subtract everything but that one meal.,
307,2,2020-05-08T12:57:49.000Z,s40970,Not intuitive,Trying to log food portions wasn’t very intuitive. Everything about every food entry can be edited so it’s easy to enter the wrong information. I was unable to find a way for my macro goal to only count net carbs for keto diet. I honestly don’t know why this is getting so many positive reviews. It takes too much effort to learn and figure out how to do anything and support is no help at all.,

The barcode scanner won’t read half the time, I try to add custom entries or change the method of weighing things and literally nothing changes when I hit update. Would be a nice app if it worked like it should, although someone like my mom wouldn’t figure it out in a million years because it’s not intuitive at ALL.",
310,5,2017-04-11T16:24:22.000Z,Kentucky9,Great for MMA fighters and athletes,If you want to track your diet and macros for weight cuts or competition this is a great app. It also works for general diet tracking to keep yourself on track for healthy lifestyle.

I searched for bell pepper and got everything but bell pepper. Also the barcode scanner does not give correct values- at least it doesn’t match the nutrition label on what I’ve scanned.

Again, you will look thru maybe thousands of entries for carrot cake, carrot bread, before you find just plain raw carrot.  Its mind numbing and wasteful of my time.

439,1,2020-06-21T18:24:56.000Z,studentwcu,Horrible app,This is the worst. It shouldn’t be hard. Literally nothing comes up on the search easily and it will limit measurements of things like almond milk to milliliters. It measures bread in grams instead of by the slice. When you search something simple like zucchini you have to scroll through a bunch of processed foods to get to regular zucchini. Same with a simple boiled egg. Awful. I’m deleting it.,

The measurements are strange, sometimes they’re measured in cups, grams, or ounces. But you can only convert from grams to ounces or vice versa.

665,1,2019-05-15T00:19:24.000Z,ashleyjcs,Misleading,Not as functional as they’ve made it seem and not enough food in their database to track. Also the calories displayed for certain foods were completely inaccurate.,

If you eat food ever then you're ""on a diet"" is how I see it) limits the amount of carb intake, but it's net carbs not just total carbs (being into fitness, I'm sure you're aware of this). Right now it's a bit difficult to track the total net carbs on the app. Yes, you can change carbs to net carbs shown for each individual meal, but it doesn't count the net carbs in the daily totals. When looking at the daily total, summary and macro breakdown it looks like I'm over most days on my carbs and didn't hit my goal when this is isn't the case. PLEASE let us change the total carbs to total net carbs! This is the most important change I'd love to see. I also agree with some of the other reviews... The app is pretty nice, but I'd love it more if it were a bit more user friendly. The serving sizes/options are sometimes off, the barcode scanning can be hit or miss (once I got a completely different item than what I scanned), and there's SOOO many options when searching an item.. In some ways this can be nice, but mostly it's just confusing because they all differ slightly on the counts and you aren't sure which to choose, especially when you don't have a nutrition label to go off of. I think this is a pretty nice app, it's clean looking and has a lot of great features. But please consider adding an option to change daily total to net carbs!

1050,2,2016-06-06T14:41:18.000Z,MariaElaina,"Lots of packaged/brand name foods, few whole foods, by amount is inconsistent","I was pretty excited about this app, so I started logging my meals right away. I'm sad to report that I won't be continuing with it. My main complaint: I eat a lot of whole foods and cook my own meals. The food database for mm+ seems to contain a lot of packaged/brand name foods and restaurant meals, but not as many basic/simple components like ""chicken, thigh meat,"" or ""sashimi grade tuna."" Yes, you can enter your own items into the database... but I was surprised to find these lacking in the first place. I have quite a bit of experience with other food logging applications, so I have a good sense of what these nutritional databases typically contain. I live abroad and I don't eat a lot of packaged food, so the food library as it stands today doesn't really work for me. Also, sometimes I find items that are only listed as 1 serving, when what I really want is the ability to enter an amount (like 3 ounces or 50 grams). I find the input experience a bit laboroius and clunky (too many unnecessary clicks and swipes to enter foods), and I could never figure out how to save common recipes (e.g. my breakfast smoothie) that I'd use over and over again. In short, I wasn't a fan. I've used better applications that I didn't have to pay for... though I will say that those other apps don't as readily support custom macro goals and tracking that specific aspect of your nutrition.",

1062,1,2016-03-30T06:51:43.000Z,Zaondo,PLEASE READ!!! (Missing important components),"Doesn't track anything besides calories, carbs, sugar, fiber, fats, protein, sodium, and cholesterol. I was looking for a nutritional app with vitamins and minerals, etc. A lot of health problems develop because of nutritional deficiencies and the limited nutritional data on this app is disappointing. I intended on tracking a wide variety of nutritional aspects of my diet but am unable to with this app, in its current state. I suggest the developers to add all the nutritional data of all foods to this app. Also, I suggest possibly consulting with nutritionalists and dietitians to add accurate nutritional information on the function/importance/risk associated with various nutritional data such as vitamins, minerals, fats, protein, etc. Also, how excess and deficiencies in personal nutritional aspects may effect health. Nutrition does not just effect physical attributes but it also significantly effects emotional attributes such as depression. This app is currently a tool to track limited data but it has the potential to become an education device that could potential help people manage and understand their own complicated health/nutritional needs. This would help people track and develop their nutritional diet to improve physically AND mentally. With the solid support base this app currently has, I feel like a lot of people could benefit from these changes which is why I hope the developer reads this. Peace.",
1063,4,2016-03-31T16:06:54.000Z,dedios09,Fantastic and only keeps getting better,"This is a fantastic app and a great competitor to MyFitnessPal. I like that I'm able to customize my own macros and not rely on ""ratios"". Being a natural bodybuilder this app makes my life easier by displaying my macros after every food item that I add, letting me know if I'm on track to hit my targets. Being a competitor I need to be able to switch macro targets from time to time whether I'm in a cutting or bulking phase. MyMacros has great potential and keeps getting better with every iteration. A couple things I would like to see would be the possibility of scheduling different macros on different days. For example, refeed macros every Saturday and daily macros every other day of the week. Another sweet feature would be reminders to update weight and track if days go by without tracking -this could get annoying, but would be useful to keep folks on track toward their goals. All in all, I do love this app :)",
1064,5,2016-04-17T06:04:39.000Z,HeadlessAnt,Sold app with a nice layout.,"I was reading the reviews and was really looking for an app I can add multiple meals per day. This you can have as many as you want. Also love how the totals are all are at the bottom of each sheet and the total at the bottom of the day. I find this really interactive and easy to use. It was a change from my fitness pal. The scanner is easy to use and better than previous app. I love the push and pop on the day. Best use of this feature on the iPhone yet. Ok. Complaints. The database is good but needs updates. Like no seared tuna, see its when eating out and trying to search for items it struggles. Also the recipe needs help. In my fitness pal this is amazing, which I still use because of it. The only feature I do miss is the integration with strava or adding workouts. But this is not a big loss. Stick with what you do best which makes this app excellent. Glad I have joined the community. Can't wait to see what is next.",
1065,5,2016-06-16T13:47:26.000Z,Paradigm816,Needs Measuring Algorithms,"Great potential, but this app is in desperate need of food measuring algorithms. I measure my drinks in ounces or cups and my food in grams or ounces, however, if I wanted to pour only 6 ounces of almond milk, this app doesn't allow me to quickly and practically do that. I have to stop and think ""how many ounces in a cup?"" (This is just an example, I know it's 8) and then I have to divide 8 by 6 and am left with a really weird number to input into the app. There needs to be a quick menu to change from ounces, to cups, to whatever. See MyFitnessPal. Their calculation algorithms are great!",
1066,5,2016-06-28T17:34:57.000Z,Sabbake,User friendly! Truly helpful.,"My favorite part about this app is the barcode scanner. It's so easy to just scan the barcodes of whatever I'm making, and then input how much I eat. It calculates all the nutritional value and I see how much I'm getting or not getting. It's helped me quite a bit since I started using it. It's harder to reach nutritional goals than you'd think, and seeing what I eat every time helps keep me accountable and aware, since I have quite the sugar/carb tooth. I also like how you can just search things or manually enter them in a simple format when you can't scan a barcode. You do have to enter each part of your meal individually, I mean even the sides or toppings. But that's not a downside to me because I see it as a more detailed breakdown of my food and I'm seeing exactly where the good calories and bad calories are coming from. Overall great app!! Worth it.",
1067,2,2016-10-29T16:00:19.000Z,Gracer77,Very Imprecise,I'm trying keno for the first time. Keto is similar to Paleo but even stricter on the carb side. Very little fruit and limited veggies and heavy on the healthy fats. So - I'm exploring lots of unique recipes.  You really need to monitor your ratio of fat/protein/*NET* carbs.,
1068,5,2017-01-19T17:52:18.000Z,Sandesto,Better alternative to MFP,"I switched over to this app from MFP when that app started playing video ads and wanted to charge a huge monthly fee to properly track macros.  Once I got used to it, I actually prefer this interface.  I don't bother searching the database for new foods, once you get used to it, it only takes about 5-10 seconds to enter the macros for a new food item, so that's easier than searching the database or scanning the barcode.",

But there are a few things missing/tweaks that can be made. It has body weight...and it would be nice to be able to log water consumption and also sleep. I know this app is mainly directed towards macro counting but these features would make it a more well-rounded health logging app in general. ALSO, the app keeps asking me to sync my content. I continually hit 'no' but it will pop up several times while I'm using it. This can be a hassle with iPhone because if I'm adding a custom food and the keyboard is displayed, I am not able to press no or back out of the keyboard to see the 'no' button and I have to exit the app completely and restart from the top. I always pray it doesn't pop up in the middle of adding custom food because it's frustrating and a huge waste of time to redo the math and go through the whole motion again. Please only ask once if a person would like to sync their data and direct them towards a place in the app they can MANUALLY find if they change their mind... or add a 'do not show again' option. Other than that, this app is AWESOME and helping me to achieve my health/fitness goals. Thank you!",
1070,4,2014-03-21T16:46:51.000Z,Flymeaway,"Great app, 1 thing to fix",This was exactly what I was looking for. I am trying to start the iifym diet system (if it fits your macros) and this makes it easy to see where I am at with my daily macro intake. The weight tracking system is very cool too. It allows you to see how on track you have been and gives you incentive to stay on your diet. Also the custom diet plan option is great! Instead of having a set carb/protein/fat ratio for everyone it allows you to choose your own option unlike other apps like myfitnesspal or livestrong. The only downside to this app is that the food database is very limited. I think that if the app developer expanded the food options as well as the brand name options then this app would be unbelievably easy and perfect to use for ALL dieting plans not just iifym. Good start for an app only released a couple weeks ago!,
1071,4,2015-01-05T01:53:56.000Z,MastinoMom,"Good, but could be even better","I’m training for my first fitness competition and downloaded this app because I needed an easy and convenient way to track my daily macros.  It does what it says it does and is fairly easy to use, however, there are some things I wish it had that it doesn’t.  Specifically, this app would be even better if you could track water intake (I need to drink a gallon a day), supplements (I take several), and take notes about your food intake.  Also, I used the app to email my trainer and, even though my total daily calories were correct, the calories for each individual meal were not.  I can’t figure out how to fix this.  I think it may be a bug.  Other than these minor issues, the app is a good deal for the price and I recommend it for any fitness and nutrition buff.",
1072,5,2015-08-09T19:52:35.000Z,navidivad,Great,"The App is My favorite, but I see 2 problems that I want to know if it is possible to solves as faster as possible please. One of this problems is that the Kcal of what do you register, in the days goals...There is always bad calculated the Kcal compared to the macronutrients, it count less calories that it should count. The other observation is that when you set a goal, you should personalize it; I mean the amount of fiber, sugar, unsaturated fats etc. Please check this points; but apart of these points, the app is awesome.",
1073,4,2015-11-01T15:15:47.000Z,Bviva,"Great app, user friendly","This is a great app to customize and track macros.  As a first time macro tracker, I find this app user friendly and helpful. The colors and numbers on the home page keep me aware of where I am number-wise throughout the day. The daily weight tracker keeps track and shows the user where you are compared to previous days. The user can search foods by brand, find recipes within the app from other users (macros included,) and add food that is not in the app using the barcode or manually adding numbers. I really like how you can save a meal and name it, so that way in a few taps the meal desired is added. The only complaint I have is when searching ""by brand"" for food, one has to scroll as opposed to tapping the letter on the side like an address book or song search on an Apple product. Super minor detail but nonetheless, awesome app! :)",
1074,5,2015-12-25T14:22:49.000Z,DeCa05,Fantastic Tool,"This is a wonderful tool for tracking your macros. The only draw backs are that sometimes it doesn't have the food your looking for so you have to create a ""custom"" food (but the app saves it for future use, so it's not so bad) and it doesn't track the time that you actually ate (yet you can label each meal and even create custom labels, aka snack1 or snack2). Other than those minor things I can't think of anything that I would change (well except if they started adding features that tracked weight and measurements/connected to a fitness tracker/recorded exercise/etc., yet that would  a super all-in-one app, lol). The layout is simple and easy to use. This app basically takes away all excuses for not tracking your macros!!!!! Buy it!!!!!",
1075,4,2016-03-18T14:56:18.000Z,MuchoHola,Overall a solid app,"Pretty easy to use and has a clean UI, although there are some things that make it a little weird sometimes. As of right now I can't (or maybe I don't know how to work It correctly, also possible) have multiple ""snack"" meals. So, if I have an apple in between breakfast and lunch, and then maybe some nuts between lunch and dinner, they will be grouped together and I am unable to have my meals organized chronologically. I find also that some of the ways that food is calculated/shown (grams/oz/etc) also can be slightly problematic for me since I don't always measure my food that way. I understand that it is much more accurate, but I'm not really weighing the strawberries that I'm cutting up to put in my oatmeal in the morning.",

Most ""diet"" app's are geared only towards counting calories. I was delighted when I came across this app AND that it was easy to use! I love the features & the ability to view graphs based on fats/proteins/carbs. The barcode scanner is a blessing. While there is a decent sized pre-added food inventory, it's very nice to add you own manually or by using the barcode scanner. The ONLY thing that gets to me is that when using the barcode scanner occasionally the nutrients are off from what the actual package says. Just a little thing! Otherwise this app is perfect for me! Thanks so much!!",

However, where it excels in interface, it greatly lacks in its food database and search engine. Adding food is not too difficult, but is a nuisance when an easy search in MFP would bring it up.",
1080,3,2014-04-30T11:35:23.000Z,chescaleigh,Good but not great,"I really like this app but it's severely lacking in a few areas. I really like how the daily journal is set up because it's easy to read and keep yourself on track. You can instantly see how much you have left for each area, which is crucial. No guess work or on the go math needed. It has the ability to back up all of your data...but it doesn't really work. I took a month off for travel/work and now my custom foods and goals are no longer in the app. The barcode scanner is great in theory, but again, it doesn't work. Things will scan and not have any data or will pull up the completely incorrect product. If the food database was larger, the scanner was more reliable and the profiles were actually saved this world be a 5 star app.",
1081,4,2015-05-28T19:31:00.000Z,hooverALgal,Perfect for customizing macros,"Since MFP changed their app, you now have to pay to enter custom macronutrient values (which is total bull). I downloaded this app because of the good reviews and it has been great. I will admit it was a bit confusing at first coming from MFP but now that I know how to operate it, it is so much easier. Completely customizable macro values. I'm currently reverse dieting so my macros are changing weekly and it is easy to change them through the app. Well worth the money. Only thing I wish was that the search engine worked a little better. When I search for things they don't show up all the time but when I scan the barcode they do. Not sure about that but otherwise a wonderful app!",
1082,5,2015-07-05T03:13:56.000Z,AndrewB.95,Great customer support,"This app is wonderful once you get used to its workflow. Loaded with functionality, including weight tracker and the ability to look up foods, I have yet to find a food that is not in this apps library. I also love how in the recipes section I don't have to input my own nutritional values for all the ingredients I just look them up individually from within the recipes menu and the app does the work for me! I also had a question about functionality and I emailed the staff using the send feedback button to ask it and I got an answer within hours on a Saturday from the co-founder of the app, who better for a functionality question?! Amazing app that's well worth the 3 dollars, keep it up!",

However, there are still some bugs that the developer doesn't address nor respond back in bug reports. Animation is also very sluggish/choppy. He is very responsive for feature inquiries prior to you buying to sell you the app though. Afterwards, nothing but silence.",
1084,5,2015-10-19T12:32:20.000Z,Witness this,GREAT EASY TO USE APP,"I have been using this app for a little over a year and couldn't be more pleased. I just add all my foods via the custom input and track my macros from there. I also love how it shows the remaining macros of each day and the percentages of each food group. It also has an awesome feature where it sends you an email at the end of each week to show what you kcal intake was for each day. The only things I would add to app is a time when I eat each meal or when you enter your info in and on the email it shows your overall kcal for the week, so I don't have to add it every time. But other than that totally recommend. Great easy to use app.",

There was a power failure that lasted for twenty four + hours, and I was like a fish out of water, as MFP would not work off line, so I looked for a app that would as I will soon be traveling on a cruise ship for four weeks. Once I found MM+, started using it, I fell in love with it. It is easy to use, you can put in the amount you eat and it calculates the nutrition value for you. As it works off line, I take my iPad to dinner with me as I have been diagnosed as a borderline diabetic, I have reduced my body weight from 203lbs. to 155lbs, and I want to maintain that. I gave the app four stars, as there is always room for improvement.",

For some reason some foods don't seem to ""save"" in my custom and favorites either (or maybe I'm just not finding them). So I need to rescan (my butter for example). The longer I use the app and the more foods I add, the nicer it would be to search only my foods. Same goes for search by brand. I wish I could then select the global search or just my foods. But these are wish items. The current app functions great and is helping me change my body. Huge thanks to the creators and the team!!",
1088,2,2017-01-13T16:00:39.000Z,Kincade70,Disappointing,"This app is disappointing… I use Fitbit to track cals and have just moved on to tracking Macro’s, I didn’t want to pay for a subscription to MFP so tried this app instead. Overall I found the interface clunky, not intuitive to add items. Also, its heavily focused on fast food outlets and brands… I cook a lot, and fresh food and vegetables tend to be way down the list of items. Also, each item only has one weight variable so often hard to find items that meet my specific foods with appropriate measurements, such as kgs, or lbs, etc., had to use “a cup of this, a piece of that, an oz something else…” no consistency. I didn’t subscribe and therefore did not use the extended database, which might be better, but I doubt it. I ended reverting to Fitbit to track cals and developed a simple spreadsheet to track macros. Waste of $2.99 for me.",
1089,5,2017-01-28T03:03:53.000Z,Krd0613,Fantastic Macros Tracker.,I switched over from MFP. Iv have been using that for about a year. It always felt bloated and full of stuff I didn't want. I just wanted to keep a food log and track my macros. This app does this with ease. It is well designed and everything iv thrown at it has been in the database. If not then it's just 5-10 seconds to enter it yourself it has a clean interface and is quick and easy. I'm so glad I found this app and support it fully. Thank you to the creater. Please keep making it better. It's already a great app. One suggestion I would ask of though would be to add a + button on the main screen to use the scanner a little quicker. Besides that this app is epic.,

This is the app I have been looking for. After spending months calculating and manually adding/updating and recording macros/cals in the ""notes"" app, this was a breath of fresh air. It is very easy to use, efficient and extremely accurate. (I've double/triple checked many of the available listed foods and they are spot on!) I can really say this borderline changed my lift and I recommend this for anyone from someone who is ""dieting"" to drop a few lb's... To the serious competitive athlete or bodybuilder. Thanks for developing this!",
1091,3,2014-01-31T19:36:07.000Z,jenneskimo,Not as convenient as I thought,"I wanted an app that I could track my macros per meal as well as daily. The search function is almost useless as the current database is so small. For example I searched ""brown rice"" only to get one option (great value) for actual rice and a bunch for rice cakes. The serving isn't outlined so I have to guess how much is one serving based on calories. The barcode function is also useless. Instead of finding the actual item, I get a list of completely unrelated items (infant formula?!) I'm finding it's taking a lot more time to log food on this app then any other I've tried. If I have to spend at least 5 mins logging a 250 calorie meal every time I eat, I won't bother logging at all. Very counterproductive.",

At first I tried myfitnesspal and was left feeling frustrated because the system wasn't intuitive and I couldn't figure out how to set my macro goals precisely. I then began hunting for an app on google.  I StumbleUpon MyMacros+ and loved it from the start. It's super easy to use, it remembers my favorite meals and I can seamlessly switch from a low carb day to a high day back to a low day and then to a Refeed day all with the touch of a button. You enter your different goals once, it remembers and you can toggle through them easily. I highly recommend this app!!",

Since my goal is weight loss it's important to me to be able to easily track calories in and calories out but the sync function between this app and my workout+ needs some work. The data between the apps is not accurate. Even when I hit ""upload all"" to sync the data between the apps one is always off. Right now, my data for today is suddenly my data for yesterday too. Too cumbersome. Would've given the app 2 stars but their response to my email was super quick. Unfortunately their suggestion didn't rectify the issue.

The customization with the food is awesome & being able to add your own food and have the app calculate the exact macros for whatever serving size is great. On top of that Jason has awesome customer service. I emailed him with several questions and within minutes I had responses directly from him. He answered all my questions and was great to talk to. This was literally the first app I purchased off the app store and so glad I did. Thanks Jason for the best app on the app store.,

However, with that being said it could use a few changes. I would like if they made it so that you could move your food around to different meals would be nice without having to delete then search and add then add the food to the corresponding meal. Another is if they would add a barcode scanner icon on the UI for quicker access without having to go search for the barcode scanner to scan food.",

I do agree with others that the database has lots of entries that could be right or wrong, but you'll find the same thing with my fitness pal... and it's not that hard to look on the Internet and enter it yourself! otherwise, I love the goal tracking and the display, and everything is so seamless. love it!",

Which is especially useful for athletes who are constantly changing macro ratios. With more people using the app, there are now more pre-tracked food options in the ""search"". Save your favorite meals, most tracked foods, recipes etc.",

There are a few quirks that I am sure will be improved. The food list seems to be a bit small compared to others. If more items get added this app would be 5 star. Also, if it were compatible with MapMyRun and/or other apps for working out, that would improve the app as well. I like the connection that a different app has so when wearing my hear rate monitor and knowing how many calories I burned would be added to this app. Again, I really love this app for food tracking alone, it rocks.",

Manually adding food is easy too. The best thing I like about this is that I can see in each of my meals how much of each macro is in each entry - so I can adjust my amounts of food when I'm meal planning so I can make my macros fit in my day.

The fitnesspal app wants (for premium) 10$ a month or 50$ a year. With Macros you get premium for a one time payment. Looking back I now would have gladly payed more than 3$ the UI is easy to use and after a week or so of use all your regular foods are there and makes things quick and easy. If you are new to or have been doing IIFYM this app will help you be accurate and will be easier to use than the under armour app with tons of ads (myfitnesspal). Also try pairing this app with the workout one as well!",

Takes 2 seconds to enter a whole day. And it's all super accurate. I'm down 4lbs in 1 week and without knowing exactly what I'm putting in my body everyday thru this app, I wouldn't have been able to do that!!

However, MM+ has been a godsend.  It doesn't focus on calories but macros instead which has helped me tremendously.  The food library is fairly comprehensive and I find it very easy to track my meals.  MM+ is a simple but effective tool for macro tracking and is well worth the small fee, especially when compared to apps like MFP that requires a $10/month subscription for macro tracking",

I really like the layout of this app. The only things I would like to see improvements on are the search engine (type in a restaurant name and see food options for that place and so I don't have to be as exact with wording), have recent foods sorted by most recently used instead of alphabetical order and I would also like to add multiple foods to a meal at once instead of individually. I rarely eat the same exact meals each day so saving a meal to add it again later doesn't help me out very much.",

Very simple and practical,"The way this app is set up is perfect, it keeps your goal and current macros on display and even counts down how much you have left every day. It also synchronizes with avatar nutrition accounts which makes using those macro numbers 10x's easier. Some certain branded foods can be a little difficult to find in the search, but you will at least get something similar. Entering in the food measurements is very easy, instead of having to enter grams in multiples of 100 like other tracking apps, you can enter in the precise number and go as high as you want.",
1109,2,2017-02-25T17:21:43.000Z,Nixrvca,Customizable but extremely clunky and not user friendly,"Coming from MyFitnessPal, this thing is difficult to use. Yes, I can track my macros to the gram, unlike free MFP. Foods entered into MM are saved, but in no way except a forever-long alphabetical list. There's no way to organize your foods in a way that makes any sense. Foods that are entered with the barcode scanner work most of the time, but instead of coming into the app as a serving, it comes in in individual grams. Even a pre-measured yogurt cup that I shouldn't have to know how many grams are in it, since it's pre-measured. To access MM online, you have to pay a monthly subscription. This app isn't worth the $3. I have been using it nearly a month now, hoping it will get easier, but it's just annoying. Don't waste your money.",

You have the option to create multiple goal profiles with different macros (I have ""training day"" macros and ""rest day"" macros"") and it displays your goals clearly at the bottom of your food log, along with your current macros, and with just a tap it shows your remaining macros as well! You can create as many meals as you want and name them yourself, so whether you practice intermittent fasting or classic bodybuilding practice with several meals a day I think you'll find this app useful.

Unlike livestrong, you have complete control over the food nutritional values with this app which was the one reason I switched. It's easy to add new foods for easy re-entry into new meals. Since the app is geared towards Marco counting, it makes easy work for staying on track. For example you can set Marco goals per day, ie training day vs rest day. It's a great start and with some polishing it'll be a 5 star app. I hope the Macro progress improves, even add calories targets with graphs would be great. You can track your weight, awesome, by why not add tracking measurements too. Even as a paid addon.",

It makes it easy for me to check up on their weight as well as make sure they are hitting their macros. Great for people like me who do IIFYM/flexible dieting. I never review apps, but this one is well worth my time to review! Also if you have issues or suggestion, the developer responds quickly, as he is always looking for ways to improve his app.",
1113,5,2015-06-05T01:04:42.000Z,Cbluey,MFP is better hands down however..,"For the price you pay for this makes this a much better macro tracking solution. Only bothersome part is the food database is static meaning you won't be searching a constant and always growing database, however this could be nice for when you have no data connection.",
1114,5,2015-09-12T17:20:35.000Z,Pkoslowski,Great App!,"I've just started a serious fitness program and am totally new to the whole tracking your food thing. This is the first food tracking app that I have ever used, and it's so easy that its quickly become second nature to just enter my food and go. And I absolutely LOVE the barcode scanner! I actually let out a ""woo hoo"" the first time I used that!",
1115,4,2016-02-24T19:29:41.000Z,Chel_say,Not bad,"I do like this app as a macro calculator, but I feel as though it still has a way to go.",
1116,5,2016-06-29T18:29:37.000Z,Hop Nugget,Hands Down The Best!,"This app gives me everything I need without having to ""trick"" it into working the way I want it too.  Finally a gram tracking app that doesn't assume it knows better than me, or force me to use percentages when I want to track precise grams. Fully customizable to my needs.  Recommending this especially to anyone following a ketogenic lifestyle.",
1117,2,2016-12-24T04:22:31.000Z,kthypear,Had high hopes,"I loved all the nutrients this app can track.  The list of food is quite a large, and being able to enter custom food was a plus.  I hate that you can only enter one meal.  Once you select lunch or dinner you are stuck with that meal all day.  Every time you add food it just piles on the one meal, oh and there is no breakfast option.  But you can copy that large meal to the next day and delete off what you didn't eat, I guess that is a plus.  So if you track food all day, you either look like you ate 1800 calories for lunch or dinner, I hate the way that looks. And what no snacks! Again you just lump them right in. Will be finding me a new app, as this might be a gimmick to make me by pro, oh wait I did, right?",

Once you start using the app, you can create weight goals, micronutrient goals per day, and more! Love the interface design as it is clean and stores food favorites. You can create your own recipes and enter into the app for serving sizes and measurements. Works well when baking yummy treats and I want to know how much each serving yield for proteins, carbs, and fats. Highly recommend for anyone wanting more freedom in healthy eating and an easy-to-use app, accessible via phone and tablet and soon, computer!",
1119,5,2017-01-19T12:00:12.000Z,entspeak,An excellent app for tracking macros!,"For what I need a calorie tracker to do, this is better than MyFitnessPal. Primarily, because it is less expensive and doesn't require the subscription for basic things like the ability to have multiple daily goals - which is necessary if you're carb cycling, or doing something like LeanGains. And, the developer listens to what the community needs. The one thing I found lacking was an ability to choose a different nutrition goal before making a food entry; I wrote the developer about it - now, it has that ability. (I'm sure it was requested by others, as well.)",
1120,5,2013-12-28T22:52:13.000Z,mal1ce,Great App!,"Best app for tracking macros IMO. Very easy to setup custom foods, meals can be copied within day, or from one day to another, and Fast Track feature allows you to add macros for a meal or foods that are not in your list already.",

The only thing that needs to be added is which is crucial to an app like this are more food options when searching for foods and their brands, its very limited when it comes to that. But again if you know the nutrition facts of what youre eating then you can always add it to the customize section. Overall its an easy to use app!!",

The search feature is a little weird, you can't search for specific things, if you want a brand you can't search for it you have to go through the Brand tab, which is a little annoying. Also I would like to be able to edit my sugar info/goals.. Otherwise, this and the track my workout+ app together is better than anything else I have used!",

My Macros + allows a better breakdown as well as per meal macro breakdown which is a huge plus over most everything else I've tried.,

It takes some time the first week to get used to tracking, but it holds you accountable for the food you eat! I love how it keeps store of frequent meals making things a lot easier after the first week.  Turns out my problem was I wasn't eating enough food!! My performance in the gym and my energy level has increased tremendously. My advice is to stick with it. It's hard to figure out meals that fit your macros initially, but once you get the hang of it the results are worth it!",

For example macros being counted based on the food labeling and also better barcode scanner with a flash. I also think it's imperative that all nutrition facts are labeled down. Like potassium and vitamins are essential information logs for everyone. Proper food search with macros for various restaurants. A home dash board to view macros is a great idea to implement In an update for this app. I love it can be better great work. 😊❤️👌",

It doesn't make sense to be so meticulous about macro tracking, and then encouraging to judge progress based on just WEIGHT alone. We all know the scale isn't everything. Second thing is I would love for it to convert from imperial to metric and vice versa like some competitor apps do (Lose It!). If both of these features were added, it would absolutely blow everything else out there out of the water.",

Once you get your customized list of foods down it's very easy to see what ratios and percentages of each macro you are eating. The whole app is very streamlined and I have had no problems with it. Setting goals for each macro (F/C/P) is easy and finding out what you need to eat more or less of each macronutrient is nice. Plus, it's all on the go with your iPhone…..what more could you want?",

The only thing I have a gripe with is the nutritional calculator. In my opinion it should use the newer formulas and should include Katch-McCardie and Harris-Benedict to predict caloric needs. You should also be able to adjust your calories and macros on your own and have them on the GUI so you can see them as you track your food. I'll stick with tap and track pro till I find this is resolved, but still a very clean app",

I use the barcode scanner often. Also you can't switch btwn oz, grams, cups, etc. when using a food from the database. Sometimes I just use one of my other apps to get the macros and enter them manually.",

When entering a custom food, I like how it breaks the serving size, regardless of entry, down to the ""1"" ounce, gram, fl oz, etc. so you only need one entry per food instead of multiple entries for each serving size. It also comes with some pre-loaded recipes, multiple macro profiles, allows weight tracking and following other users. That's just some of the features. It's well worth the $2.99 in the App Store!",

Both are absolutely perfect if you are tracking your macros and calories in vs calories out since the two apps link together. However, the Workout app might fudge the numbers on calories burned a little but it's still a somewhat accurate depiction of what you're burning throughout your day and during your workout. Anyways, love both apps and will be using them forever.",
1138,2,2016-07-20T21:03:38.000Z,hgoodwyn,not as good as MyFitnessPal,"I switched from MFP to this app so that I could input my specific macros, but found it not to be worth it. It's much harder to navigate, and while it's easy to ""create"" new foods, it makes for a lot of repeating items simply because each entry is spelled differently or something. It makes it really hard to find the food you're looking for, thus prompting you to create a new entry and restarting the cycle. With some tweaking of your percentages, MFP can give just as accurate macro goals, and you don't have to spend any money. If you're just starting to track your food/macros I suggest starting with MFP before spending money on more difficult apps like this.",

WAY off. this is minor but just be aware of foods you search for rather than input manually.",

I switched from MyFitnessPal to this and have to say its one the best decisions I've made. One of the best futures is that you could actually manually enter your protein/carbs/fat goals for the day. it has made tracking easier for me and would like to thank Jason for creating such an amazing app. My only recommendation would be to add in a barcode scanner and create a bigger food database. Other than that, the app is one of the best.",

I recommend this app to anyone and can promise you that it is well worth the money.",

The only thing I wish they would add (which would perfect this app) is that at the end of the week that they would email you a grid of your total cals consumed each day of the week AND your macros. It would make it a lot easier if you have a trainer or like to spreadsheet your macros to see you're coming along. But i guess for now, I'm stuck scrolling through each day righting them day separately.",

Once you've built your own database with your most eaten food you are clear sailing the weight tracker is pretty useful to. The barcode scanner is fantastic and if you noticed a discrepancy between the macros when you scan the barcode to when you check the label it is very easy to edit the entry and update the numbers,

Now that I have built a substantial food database, it takes me no time to track my food plan daily. It really makes you aware of what you are eating and whether or not it's worth the macros so you don't sabotage your workout. The only thing I wish it would have is the option for your trainer to log on and see your meal plan at any given moment and offer feedback. Now that would be awesome!!",

This app is made to track your MACROS...and your macros consists of calories, protein, carbs and fat. If you're looking to track anything else, than this app is not made for you.

It was working fine with my old phone, but didn't transfer all my food entries from the past and even daily which I am doing at the moment. I will enter data into my iPad, and only some of it will get transferred on my iPhone. Really weird and annoying.

One really nice feature is the option to create multiple macro goals. This is really nice for folks who modify their intake depending on whether it's a workout day or not. The interface is clean and easy to use. I'm knocking off one star because the food database is fairly limited. However, once you've added the foods you eat on a regular basis, they are easy to access going forward. So it's not much of an issue.",

You just input the macronutrients and it doesn't save it to your database but saves it to your day of eating. Covinient when your eating out. What I would like to see added is a option to take notes on the days of eating. I believe it would make the app more versatile and totally separate it from all competitors.",
1158,4,2017-01-11T10:12:36.000Z,CamKiddoh,Great attempt,Good execution at a macro app. I just wish it were easy to find the nutritional facts for basic items like a medium baked chicken drumstick and the ability to delete items from your meals without having to delete the entire meal itself. A more reliable and broader food database would be a positive and welcomed addition to this app. Scanning is a positive of this app but you can't exactly scan a chicken leg. This is the best cheapest alternative to the fitnesspal appwhich will cost you $50 annually just to track your macros if carb cycling.,

It just doesn't seem very user friendly, and I am a 20 something who grew up using Mac products. Just a little confusing and not intuitive to me!

I can't even track my exercise! MFP can link with Runkeeper, MapMyRun, Fitbit and many more but in order for me to track my fitness I would have to spend another $1.99 to get the exercise app that goes with this food tracking app.  Needless to say this lasted less than 3 days and I am back to my happy place using MFP. Waste of $3.",
1170,5,2015-01-31T13:59:55.000Z,mrs hursh,Love!!!,I just recently started iifym & this app has made the whole process sooo easy!! I love everything about this app. Cant say enough. Totally worth the very small fee! It doesnt have everything in the barcode system but its super simple to add a food & adding a recipe is super simple also. The only thing id change is that i wish it would show your fiber intake with each meal along with the protein fat & carbs. But thats not a huge deal. Love love love this app!!,
1171,5,2015-09-08T17:44:07.000Z,Sherbearidan,Really great app!,"I love this app! It is so easy to track and has a really large database. The only thing I would change is I'd like to be able to copy other user's meals. My husband and I both use the app and we would love to be able to copy each other's meals when we're having the same thing for dinner or if I find something I like that he tries later. Other than that, it's a perfect app! I've lost 20lbs using it.",
1172,5,2015-12-29T14:43:52.000Z,Im ticked,Easy to Use,"I have given this app a 5 star rating because it's so easy to use and it helps me keep track of everything going into my mouth. I love the scanner feature, it makes adding foods so much easier. My only gripe is that in the profile section you can't change the height very well. I am a guy that is 6'4"" and it won't let me accurately put in that height. Otherwise this app is beautifully put together.",
1173,5,2016-03-07T19:35:20.000Z,Sheltonholmes,The best,"I wrote a review about 6 months ago about this app and gave it 3 stars because of a few features that made it less user friendly than it could be. Well I'm back to change my review to 5 stars because those things have been fixed and this is now the fastest, most user friendly app out there for tracking macros. I love it and can't think of any ways to improve it. Buy it!",
1174,5,2016-03-16T13:45:59.000Z,Rubyfusion814,Who knew I could keep a food journal?,"I love this app! Took me a little time those first few days to get things set up, to get my basic foods entered (not that it takes a long time), and to figure out how to use the app. But now I can typically enter my meals and snacks in no time at all. So easy and super helpful for the LCHF eating plan I started in January. I've never been a fan of tracking meals, but this app makes it easy and actually kind of fun?!?!!",
1175,5,2016-05-22T20:41:44.000Z,5shogun,Definitely worth buying,I was very hesitant on buying this app and didn't like it at first but then I grew to love it!!,

1177,4,2017-01-07T00:57:00.000Z,Janyberry,Very promising for carb tracking,"I have been using MM+ for about a week now and find it much more satisfying when tracking macros/carbs than any other app I've tried before. The searchable database could be improved, but I can live with it. The scan feature works best on my iPad compared to iPhone, but I can live with that too. I appreciate the ability to see meal as well as daily totals. Generally, there's room for improvement but it's more usable than any other I've tried!",
1178,4,2017-01-30T02:23:10.000Z,intrepid14,Best Food Tracking Yet!,I love how simple this is to use and how easy it is for me to add the foods I eat with the barcode scanner! I hope they find a way to sync with Fitbit at some point so I can have all of my tracking information in one place and that it integrates more seamlessly with the workout app data and I could see how a meal or snack would contribute to meeting my goals for the rest of the day before having to add it! I think that last thing would definitely make it 5 stars.,
1179,5,2017-02-17T13:01:40.000Z,Wrappedhelicallyaroundanaxis,Great app,It's a great app. I can track my macros efficiently. Very simple to use and understand as far as interface goes. Even go so far as to today options which if you like me on a ketogenic cycle you can choose your different days so your macros will change as you choose it. I recommended it to my girlfriend and likewise I would recommend it to other people as well if you're serious about physical fitness,
1180,5,2015-12-14T22:50:31.000Z,Ah8989,"Didn't like it at first, love it now!",I was a MFP user for a couple years. I tried the online version of MM and was hesitant to buy the mobile version. At first it was annoying to use because I tried adding foods like I did with MFP. Once I started using the Barcode Scanner to enter my food it got so much easier. Really user friendly and I love the weekly email summaries that show how I did that week. Definitely recommend it!,

It doesn't matter what your goals are, whether it's to lose weight, maintain weight, weekend warrior, or professional bodybuilder/model...you plug in the macros you want to achieve and it tracks them for you by the food you log, and it gives you the remainders you need to meet throughout the day as you eat. Works great with the Renaissance Diet.",

I've used it literally every day for the past two weeks and love it. It's not as highly polished as some of the other food logging apps that have been around longer, but macros are my main concern and this app keeps them front-row-center and helps me make more informed and better dietary choices that fit my specific goals.",
1185,3,2016-06-29T08:39:23.000Z,BassHedz,"Not bad, but could use some improvement","Overall, a decent UI and easy to understand. However, one HUGE annoyance is when you pre-fill an item using the “recent” list. When you tweak the numbers for that one particular meal only (sometimes portions are larger or smaller), it goes back and changes them on EVERY SINGLE instance that specific item appears. This is EXTREMELY annoying.",
1186,5,2016-07-15T19:07:31.000Z,mlp03909,Love it!,"This app works perfectly for me. It is the first time I have tried the system of tracking macros, and I love being able to make my plan the night before or in the morning, so that when I'm deciding what I'm going to, or NOT going to eat, I can see where I'm at. I also find that this method really reduces my anxiety around food tracking because I'm tracking what's important, and focusing on that.",
1187,5,2016-12-09T04:07:08.000Z,Dyrrrrrin,Amazing app!,"Personally, I consider myself to be a rather avid and regular gym-goer/lifter, and when I began my individual fitness journey in 2013 I knew I would need something great to track my calories/macronutrients with that was more reliable than a notepad every single day. Since then, I've used this app literally every single day to add and log my daily nutrition and to keep track of my dietary progress (or sometimes lack thereof!). Great app!",

I've used it for the past 3 weeks and love it. My prep coach has me changing macros constantly for training days, non-training days, and refeed days. This app makes it easy to change meals from day to day as well as keep favorite meals and foods stored for easy access. I highly recommend if you're a competitor looking to track your daily macros!",

I like it because it's simple compared to other apps but there are a lot of things that is wrong with it. Camera is slow to read the barcode, not a lot food information in the database, and most importantly i noticed that some of data i already put in gets deleted so when i look back to see how i did for the week, it looks like I didn't hit my numbers. Fix it please.",
1193,5,2015-10-07T18:43:45.000Z,Theharlot,Best macro tracking app,It might take a bit of getting used to if you're used to using MFP but it's leaps and bounds better. You don't have to pay to customize macros by grams (instead of percentage). You can set parameters for different days. Updating macros doesn't retroactively change past days. Most products can be auto converted to grams. Come out with a web API and it will basically take over the world of macro counting.,

My only recommendation for improvement would be to include the option to add notes for each day (for example, note the workout you did or how you felt consuming the foods you ate, etc.). It would enhance the ability to really drill down into nutrition day-by-day.",
1196,4,2016-03-11T11:51:03.000Z,Alltakensosuckadick,Good but could be great,"My fitness pal is killing you guys with the food database the only reason I don't like them is the monthly or yearly or charge instead of a one time payment. If you could update your food database and instead of a default 1 OZ entry of everything make it the actual serving amount, if we could preview how something will effect macros before adding it that would be awesome and if we could add pictures to the weight log this app would be perfect !",
1197,4,2016-04-26T04:47:41.000Z,Hiddentempo,"Excellent, recommending it to everyone I know","Such a great app. Time consuming but well worth it, and much better than the other over priced monthly subscription calorie tracking apps out there. My only problem with it is that the barcode scanner often yields slightly incorrect or even totally off macro counts, and custom adding foods is a little clunky and slightly confusing. Overall amazing app. You're not eating how much (or how little) you think you are.",
1198,5,2016-07-01T21:36:08.000Z,Runfloresrun,Best Tracking App Available,I utilize this app daily.

I think there could be some things added to it to make it better than the rest. My fitness pal essentially does the same thing, just a little more of a messy interface than my macros. I think the food needs to be better verified and tracked. I, however will continue to use my macros.",

My only gripes are that I liked being able to use the barcode scanner when entering recipes (like in mfp), and just because I'm creating a recipe doesn't mean I wanted it added automatically.  The food database will increase over time, I'm sure, but I could also see why this would be a deterrent off the bat.",

If I had written this review while using my iPhone  5, I would have given it 4 stars. Now, on iPhone 6 plus, and if I'm in the middle of input and lay my phone flat the entire screen compresses into a very narrow column, jumbling all info and I can't do anything.

You can adjust macro goals by gram and save different ratios to easily switch between. My complaint is with the database, as it seems many foods taken from usda's database are measured in cups instead of by weight. This goes for pretty much any vegetable I've searched, so I've had to look up info by weight and add custom foods. Fix this issue and I'd say it's the best app I use.",

1234,4,2015-11-15T14:05:09.000Z,BCalvo,"Great app, needs a little help though","I really like this app.  It's very user friendly and accurate.  One thing I would like to see is the option to barcode scan while putting in a recipe.  I made a recipe last night and I tried to put the recipe in MM+.  I gave up after being unable to find some stuff in the database.  Other than that, and the almighty limited database, this app rocks.  Much better than MFP.",
1235,5,2015-11-19T18:11:35.000Z,Stevie0050,Great App,"I've tried to diet on one other occasion. Had limited success due to lack of ability and desire to track my intake of caloric, protein and fat consumption. This App makes ability and desire not only possible but fun. Great to look at my goals versus actual intake. Just to know where along that continuum I stand at any hour of the day is an incentive to keep up the effort.",
1236,5,2016-03-30T01:16:36.000Z,Ar4246,"Easy to use, great to track!",I am a huge fan of this app! The food database seems to be accurate and covers many many foods. The tracking is easy to use and I love the color coding of my macros goals. I have consistently used this app for a few months now and think it has positively impacted my health goals. High five to the developer for great work!,

Keeps regularly used foods easily available, barcode scanner works 9 out of 10 times. Adding new foods is super easy. It even allows you to apply different macro profiles for re-feed days, cutting, bulking, etc.",
1238,4,2016-04-30T16:26:05.000Z,Ladypmff,Pretty Good,"Easy to use app for counting macros.  The format is pretty simple, but watch the nutritional information and servings.  I found I had to change the info on quite a few products.  I would like to see a comment section on each food, just to get more detailed.  I send my food journal to my trainer so she can see what I am eating and how much it affects my macros for the day.  This is a good tool for online food menus/training :)",
1239,5,2016-08-01T16:07:02.000Z,Travelandadventurejunkie,Good way to track macros,"This app is great. It has a lot of verified foods, but also allows you to customize for homemade foods. You can store favorites for quick search of the food you eat most often. It also provides a weekly summary to really show you how you are doing on a larger scale, rather than getting too lost in the day to day. Works great!",

Not only can you track calories and macronutrients, you can now use the built in diet calculator calculate your ideal calorie intake based on your body and activity, plus you can set up custom macro ratios, perfect for setting up any diet.",
1241,1,2014-10-25T16:11:02.000Z,Alek_Z,DONT BUY unless you want to enter everything in manually,"I purchased this with the hope that since it was designed by a fitness professional the nutritional information would be better than that found in other apps. I was therefore greatly disappointed when the app failed to recognize four out of the five items I had for breakfast. I don’t eat anything special; yogurt and berries with some flax seeds and almond milk. I purchased this app because I have little time to enter these items individually. Save your money, just use My Fitness Pal or other similar apps.",

I also like the scanner option, it saves on data entry time. Finding foods you already entered is super easy with the ""Recent"" or ""Custom .."" tab.  I was looking for an app. to track my Ketosis meal plans, I was not impressed with the Keto apps., I'm very happy with this app.",
1245,5,2015-10-24T14:03:34.000Z,Nguyeh6,Love it!,This app is so accurate! I used Myfitnesspal for years and was always fixing the numbers to make sure the calories came out correctly. With this app it does the work for me! It takes some time to re-enter everything again but I use MFP for the numbers to plug in and will be using this to track from now on.,
1246,5,2015-11-01T16:51:26.000Z,E busta619,Great for bodybuilders,"Have used this app for multiple years, and is very efficient for cutting and bulking cycles.  I like that I can use the barcode scanner for quick look-up of nutrient info.  Great that I can see break-down of macronutrients as well and track calories to meet goals.  5/5 in terms of software interface and ease of use.",

Tells you how much macros you consumed and how much you have left. Almost any food you can think of, this app has nutrition info for it.  Highly recommended for the fitness enthusiast.",

You need a little know-how in order to understand tracking calories, but otherwise quite intuitive, and you can build your own base of foods to use.

Unlike other apps, this one lets you see the macros of each food as you're adjusting it. Like if you have 50g of protein left in your meal and go to say a chicken breast, as you're toggling the amount, it shows you the macros at each weight. Then shows the macros/cals on the main screen",
1253,4,2015-06-01T11:37:59.000Z,Mariaislovingthia,Good Product for flexible dieters,"I think it's easier to work with than MFP. I love that once you input an item, it changes the serving size to 1 so you can customize it. Cons: I wish you could copy meals from other people, rearrange day on the main interface, and be able to check off meals you've already consumed. Overall great product that makes tracking easy.",
1254,1,2016-01-07T04:06:33.000Z,Lepilogc,DO NOT BUY THIS APP!!!!,"I cannot believe this app has 4 and a half stars. I don't even know where to begin. First of all, the food database is absolutely horrific; it is missing some of the most common brand name foods and furthermore, 95% of the foods have either the wrong name, brand, or both. The worst part is, the nutritional information on the food that is in the database is all over the place. As if that wasn't bad enough, the interface is absolutely horrible and has no organization anywhere in the app. This app is seriously a scam and I can't believe I really spent 3 bucks on it.",

Some people are using it just to lose weight (and there is a way to track that) BUT what about those of us using it for performance? There should be a way I can track how I felt, how I performed, how I slept, etc on each day so I can compare fuels/foods. Please add a feature like this and THEN I can give it 5 stars :)",

I've been and a MFP junky for years, but recently they changed to a paying membership and I lost the ability to change my macros..and I wasn't paying for a yearly membership.

I do wish that my recipes showed up on my daily log as the recipe name, rather than the ingredients, but that's a pretty minor quibble. And it's a little frustrating that there are five thousand of the exact same food in the list. People, why do we each have to add ""egg"" to the database? It's already in there! A thousand times!",

BUT would be 4 stars if it could help me calculate my needed macros. Instead I use a site online. I would give a 5 Star rating if it had the search ability of MyFitnessPal which I still use to get much of my food's nutritious fats which I then input into this app. Does a good job remembering my foods but for the price should add some features like MyFitnessPal, such as saving meals.",
1262,4,2015-10-20T14:27:37.000Z,Johnny_Leopold,Good App - Food Info Needs Work,"Overall a great app for keeping track of your macros. I'd give it 5 stars if I didn't have to use the custom input so much due to food info/serving information being off. I find the serving sizes to be the biggest problem. The sizes range from grams, to ounces, to servings, to cups, to entire meals. It's hard to know what someone else was thinking when they input the info.",
1263,2,2015-12-04T04:03:18.000Z,BSimpson0916,Has potential,"This app has potential, however there are better apps out there to track your macros. There are very limited food options and units of measurement to chose from. I tried to input a single days worth of meals and couldn't due to the lack of options to chose from. I will go back to my old tracker until this is more user friendly. The biggest plus for this is the initial user interface, it's pleasant to look at and easy enough to navigate.",
1264,3,2016-01-17T14:25:16.000Z,KemiNchicago,Okay,"The app overall is ok. I would not recommend. The food search really needs to be upgraded. A lot of healthy store bought foods cannot be found, yet you have an abundance of fast food from restaurants. The barcode scanner is horrible. If I am not under bright light it will not work. Upgrade this to turn on the phones flashlight to get a better read. There are basic and free apps that have this function.",

It reminds me of Windows XP. They definitely need to bump up the app in that sense.

1301,5,2014-02-26T22:53:20.000Z,Drewbfit,My macros,"This app is a must have for avid food trackers. So much better than my fitness pal. Easy navigation allows for quick entry. Great layout. Best part about the app is creating your own nutritional goals and being able to toggle between them, if you have a high/low carb day etc. Buy this app!!",
1302,5,2015-03-10T02:30:59.000Z,MattOstraszewski,Outstanding!!!!,This app is just above and beyond expectations! You really can't ask for anything better than this app to track macros super easy to work and super easy to understand I would not hesitate to buy this app if you're seriously wanting to gain weight or lose weight in a healthy way,
1303,5,2015-06-24T20:44:54.000Z,intomywin,Convenience!,"This app is awesome because you can adjust daily macronutrient intake, edit foods and caloric information which makes precision tracking so much easier! I love it because it has helped me tremendously during my first contest prep for my first men's physique show! Highly recommend, and worth the few dollars. 👍🏻",
1304,5,2015-07-05T15:58:02.000Z,Tcamp088,The best in macro tracking,"While the database isn't as extensive as what you'd find with myfitnesspal, it's the best and simplest app out there for tracking macros.  I am a competitive natural bodybuilder, and it's hands down down my favorite.  Any limitations you might find with the database are mitigated by your ability to input a custom food",
1305,5,2015-11-11T16:54:21.000Z,rocknrola,Great app!,"As a former myfitnesspal user, this is a nice change. Once I got all my foods in (still a work in progress), it's been a piece of cake. I like this much better than myfitnesspal. I like having the ability to change my macros whenever I want and I love that it uses the proper calories on items based on macros.",

1307,4,2016-03-31T06:54:23.000Z,HopeMarie_,"Great App, Need Website Access",This is a fantastic app. I have been using it for the past few years and I love how it gives the macro breakdown of each meal at the bottom. Only downside is I might have to switch so my coach can see my food log as you cannot access MM+ online that syncs with the app. If that happened this app would be perfect for my needs!,
1308,2,2016-07-02T17:16:50.000Z,Lana2951,Not worth it,"I was disappointed in this app for two reasons. First, it doesn't track activity. Even after I bought an activity tracker of the same company, I was unable to synchronize them and ended up calculating the total calorie intake myself. Second, the main page shows how many carbs, proteins, and fats were in one dish, but not calories. Why?! Used this app for one day, will delete it and look for another app. Wish I could get my money back.",
1309,5,2016-12-01T04:13:07.000Z,Jess61591,Best nutrition app out there,Love that it's not a calorie counting based app. The library of foods is getting more and more in it so you do not have to add in as much. Also love the serving sizes are mostly in what I measure all my foods out in. I credit the app for getting me to where I am in my physique and my progress in the sport of bodybuilding!,
1310,5,2015-02-19T01:40:06.000Z,Jodalina8765,Impressed so far!,"I started to make an Excel spreadsheet because I thought it would be the easiest to track my Macros and, well, I gave up quick when I read about this on the IIFYM website.  This is an awesome app!  I’ve used other tracking apps, like Lose It & MFP, but this is way better!  Great price too!",
1311,5,2015-02-19T21:17:27.000Z,llamasaysrawr,Really good,This is a really great app to help you keep track of macros and calories. The only thing I don't care for is that sometimes when you enter a custom food and all the macros it changes what you put in or if you scan a food it changes the serving size from the package to half,
1312,4,2015-08-25T21:22:20.000Z,aubry177,Great tool,I prefer this over MFP. I think seeing everything on one screen is great. I love that you can choose exact macros instead of percentages and keep different goals/ profiles and switch them up depending on the day. My one hope is for it to have a web interface. It would be amazing to be able to log online as well.,
1313,5,2016-03-18T22:35:00.000Z,Sl0ppyJ0e,Amazing app OUTSTANDING customer service,Amazing app for tracking macros!!! I've used half a dozen and this one trumps them all.  Customer service is top notch as well.  I've sent several emails asking newbie questions and always get a prompt response.  Updates have been very useful as well.  Best nutrition app hands down!,

The food database isn't perfect but it's quick to add custom foods easily and it's easy to google for anything that doesn't initially pull up in the results. Good UI, reliable and rewarding to use.",
1315,5,2016-07-12T00:52:35.000Z,Hitechmuscle,Beat macro tracker,"I love this app! I can honestly say, it's the best macro tracker I've used to date. It's easy to use, very intuitive. The fact that you can set multiple macro goals makes it very easy to cycle carbs or do a re-feed. I really like the ability to save and/or copy part or the entire meal, thats a real time saver.",
1316,5,2016-11-16T17:28:04.000Z,Bruins007,User Friendly,"Great app, easy to use. However, every time I make an update to the nutrition information to a certain item, that item gets deleted from every day's log that it was in.

Example... today I spent the better part of ten minutes trying to bring up cheese, or cheddar cheese... I tried brands, mild vs sharp, etc. nothing. I know it's in there, but search needs a lot more refinement. Cream cheese brings up a result.",
1318,5,2017-01-09T21:19:57.000Z,logancmc,Fantastic!,"I LOVE this app and use it to track everything about my diet. It's very simple to use but has some more hidden, advanced features that make it pretty powerful (I love the recipes feature, where you can combine multiple foods into one. I use this for my morning smoothies and it rocks!)",
1319,5,2017-03-01T23:45:35.000Z,Bearoni,The best!!!,"By far THE BEST app for people that are serious. Great layout, I wish they had a better food library but it takes me a second to load something in anyways so whatever. I love how I can enter my macros and a computer the calories automatically. It was right to the tea to my calculations! Great app!!!!!",
1320,4,2013-09-17T15:35:09.000Z,TenaciousByNature,"Great app, very useful.","Great app, very useful. Couple of issues I'd like to see fixed though. App crashes frequently and the barcode scanner is basically useless, foods are never found when scanned or they're very inaccurate when they are found. Overall, great app though, especially if you're creating and entering all foods manually.",
1321,4,2013-12-30T11:36:44.000Z,Danawig,So Thorough!,"I just downloaded this and at first glance it looks awesome!  As a figure competitor, I am always in search of the best nutrition logging app that has exactly what I need and offers ease-of-use and total customization.

1322,4,2014-08-15T13:24:10.000Z,Strommination2013,Good buy,"This was exactly what I wanted. It gives you total control over your daily macro intake on the go. You can even see pie charts for your calorie distribution breakdown from day to day to see how consistent you are being. It's easy to input your custom and favorite meals and save them for later, as well as copying meals from a previous day into a new day. Love this app!",
1323,1,2014-10-27T00:26:22.000Z,Ahja Reyn,Not worth it.,"I bought this app figuring it would be better than Myfitnesspal. It's not. It's more confusing. It is not user friendly at all. The food database is too small and has recalculated all foods up to a base of 1. Not one serving, but one cup, one ounce, etc. So when I went to enter my cereal at its 2 servings, I had to redo the math to figure out what 2 servings equated to according to this app.",
1324,4,2015-12-29T01:25:18.000Z,AdminUser,Almost perfect,"Definitely worth the purchase. I switched from MFP a while back. It's great for cycling days. I wish, how ever, fiber showed up in the meal bar like protein, carbs and fat. And most importantly, I wished the recipes would not break into ingredients in your meal. If I log my food the night before, I always have to go back, delete and renter bc I have forgotten how much of the recipe I entered.",
1325,5,2016-03-07T17:53:46.000Z,Niksecret,Calculates your macros!,Love how this app calculates your macros and allows you to save more than one option especially for those that like to carb cycle or low carb days for rest days. My only wish is a larger food database with the option to scroll to the unit of measurement within the selected food.,
1326,3,2016-03-11T07:06:36.000Z,SlashaLO,An app for the ages!,I love the app. What brought me to it is the ability to create goals SPECIFICALLY BASED ON MACROS! This is huge for me. Then I get in and see I can make different daily goals?! Heck ya!,
1327,2,2016-06-24T18:41:49.000Z,MissRo35,Don't Buy Just Yet,"It has some good starting points but not enough to buy yet. First, when scanning food from a barcode it does not allow you to enter correct info when it's wrong and it's set to 1 gram as a serving for all products. Secondly, why do I have to sign up for your free account when I just paid for the app and your global database of food. NOT COOL.",
1328,5,2016-07-09T15:09:12.000Z,Priscillatroutner,Better than MyFitnessPal,I like the fact that you can use precise measurements! It also keeps track of you're weight. Overall easily the best 3 bucks I've spent! One thing I would recommend is allowing users to upload progress pictures like MyFitnessPal.,

Unlike my fitness pal, it doesn't have those constant annoying advertisements, that are ALWAYS getting in the way. I myself am a personal trainer, and I recommend this to all my clients.",
1330,4,2014-08-26T22:50:27.000Z,Xtremesk8er21,Awesome app,This app is the best $2.99 I've spent in a long time. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I've had issues adding a saved meal from time to time (just refuses to add to the meal # I've selected or to anywhere on my days macros).,

The designer did a fantastic job!",

1333,5,2015-10-20T01:19:18.000Z,Mork83,Way better than MFP,I was apprehensive at first to pay $3 for this app. I was immediately well pleased. Yes I spent my first week plugging in my usual foods but after that it has been smooth sailing. It's just what I need for my macros tracking and no extra unecessary garbage. I have had about 5+ friends purchase this.,
1334,5,2016-03-07T20:27:53.000Z,Ninja Cow32,Love it!,"I have used my fitness pal for tracking food and find this just as easy to use but easier to see macros!  One suggestion would be when creating a recipe to be able to use the scan function.  Other than that, I love it!",

Very easy to use while tracking your intake and can customize it to your needs. The best part is the service in case you have questions or suggestions! You won't be disappointed!,
1337,1,2016-07-05T23:39:58.000Z,GuinnessCR,Don't waste your time or money,Use a free site to determine your macros needs and use MyFitnessPal. This app is so annoying and clunky to use. You're constantly have to change the amount of food because it defaults to 1 gram or 1 Cubans it's hard to make changes to that unlike MyFitnessPal (which also tells you your macros in the free version). I really don't see any benefit at all in using this app. It also doesn't have the amount of foods MyFitnessPal has. I've never had to search so much!! What a huge waste of time.,
1338,5,2016-11-30T05:23:47.000Z,Igotsuckedin,Perfect.,"Love this app. Well worth 2.99. And I hate spending money on apps. Super easy to add foods and I love the clean, uncluttered look. Only negative I noticed is when you scan your food the info can be really off but it's not a big deal since they made it so easy to enter the info manually. 5 stars. 😊",
1339,5,2016-12-07T16:41:29.000Z,jmmckenz,Love this app,I would be lost without this app. I especially love the analysis feature which helps me track my averages to ensure consistency. This keeps me sane on days when I've eaten too much. Being able to see that my averages over time are still on track is all that matters.,
1340,5,2014-01-08T16:52:57.000Z,Rutytuu,Outstanding,"Not the best database of foods but you can put them in little by little.

While I realize I am not counting calories here, the macros are based upon that max calorie amount and it always then looks like I am going over my allowed macros. I do like how you it shows you your food and remaining macros and the barcode scanner but without being able to set the calories my macros are based on, it is not useful for me.",

Not a single item that the barcode scanner has scanned as accurate information! The name and brands of the food work. But calories, protein, carbs, sodium, everything is off. It was saying my turkey meat had 2 grams less protein, 30 fewer calories, and 1 carb less than actual packaging states. Very upsetting for someone trying to really make lifestyle change and can't even trust the app for accurate numbers. I hope this is fixed very soon.",

Cumbersome for finding the raw foods, tons of duplicate entries are frustrating when searching...it would be really cool if you could scan QR codes on the packaged products and have the info populate.  Overall it has helped me a ton over tracking and tallying by hand.",
1348,4,2016-12-10T16:08:24.000Z,Adowler88,Overall a great app,"This app is helpful to track your daily and weekly macros.

THIS app is one of the few I've seen that actually focuses on the macronutrient goals, and it's faster and far less crash-prone than MFP. My Macros+ isn't quite perfect, but the author is responsive and I find it indispensable for planning meals that meet my goals.",
1355,5,2016-01-27T13:45:07.000Z,NickyMemz,excellent tracking app,"Spent a lot of years tracking and trying out the standard tracking apps—MM+ is without a doubt my favorite.

1358,4,2016-09-24T20:25:14.000Z,TonyTeaBags,Very Practical,"Works as advertised. Good, quality, practical recording and manipulation of useful data. 4 of 5 because the learning curve is shallow, and until you are entering frequent foods, searching foods is slow, tedious, and somewhat frustrating. Hang in there! After you learn to use frequent, repeating entries, the app becomes second to none.",

I wanted to try it on my watch and not only do you need the app to be running o  your phone but the fast track does absolutely nothing after you select the type of food "" breakfast, snack, post workout, etc."" no information is uploaded therefore this is useless on my watch. Disappointing because I do like the app but sometimes don't have time to sit around and add an entire nutritional menu on my phone.",

1362,2,2013-08-15T00:24:53.000Z,MeyEJane,Worst database,I was really excited when I downloaded this app because I was able to have custom macros set up unlike myfitnesspal. Once I started scanning and searching for the foods I ate I couldn't find any and the ones that I did find were incorrect. I would love to see this app have a larger database of foods. Manually entering all my foods is too much work even though I eat a lot of the same stuff. I don't want to spend all my time doing this.,

1364,1,2015-01-25T06:26:02.000Z,Swedriguez,Not as good as MyFitnessPal,Started counting my macros with MyFitnessPal. Worked great because it had any food imagined at a 1 oz measurable. Although on MFP you couldn't select an exact macro goal you still could keep track by looking at our goal detains. On this app the first foods I looked for for meal 1 didn't even find anything. 1 oz of grilled steak brings up different steak servings from various restaurants. Same for over easy egg or anything I searched for. This app isn't worth the money. I'll stick to using MyFitnessPal. Don't waste your money.,

The only reason I didn't give the full 5 stars is because I have to input a lot of foods into the system. Not a big deal, but it does take a little extra time.",
1371,5,2015-09-26T14:24:42.000Z,PaulSpot,The best for the price,I tried many other apps and this was the only one that easily let me set goals per day (train/rest) and for cheap. Searching could work better but it's still better than the rest. Don't blow 50 bucks a year elsewhere.,
1372,5,2016-03-05T21:15:36.000Z,definenormal32,Favorite nutrition app,This is by far my favorite nutrition tracking app. I use it every day to track my macros and make sure that I am on point.

I was really disappointed in the fact that the app won't automatically parse a recipe from a website like MFP. I cook a lot from websites and it is such a time saving tool, especially when you are a busy mom. I also would say MFP has a better food database, but I guess that comes with time.",

After taking a few months hiatus I came back this week and I have to say the search function and barcode scanner do not work at all. I have tried multiple times to find foods or scan a barcode and it literally does not work. What in the world is going on? Very frustrating!,

I find myself wasting a lot of time having to manually plug everything in myself. PLEASE expand your database so I can keep using this.",
1381,4,2013-11-29T20:26:40.000Z,SaschatheGreat,Great,"Excellent macro and calorie tracker! Very user friendly input system. Better than MyFitnessPal for inputting your own macro ratios and/or per gram amounts if you don't use ratios. Only down fall in my opinion is the item scanner, which isn't the most accurate.

1386,1,2016-03-28T11:06:18.000Z,MKMMatt1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this app to replace MyFitnessPal so that I could get more detailed nutritional info. After reading many positive reviews and seeing that they had so many foods loaded in I tried it out. What a waste of money. MFP has virtually every food I plugged in, not so here where less than half of the foods I looked up were either not listed or not listed in the size I used. I started plugging in the data from MFP and then realized what a waste of time that was and filed the app. Hugely disappointing.",
1387,5,2016-04-08T16:02:53.000Z,Sarbear8887,Wonderful app,Love this app! It would be great if you could wrote notes attached to your meals and if you could pre-set future macros because I do carb-cycling and it would make it that much easier than having to go switch the goals every day. Thanks!,

1395,5,2016-01-13T06:44:22.000Z,WolfeRose,Mint app for your calories,This app takes the confusion out of counting macros- it has so many food options and a barcode scanner for items that you can't find in the app. Customize your own ratios and get a summary emailed to you each week. It's amazing,

I've been using My Fitness Pal for the longest time, but wanted to set macro goals in grams rather than percents. My Macros + allows you to do that. However, the search engine is terrible. It's hard to find the exact food you are looking for. Even with the barcode scanner, I wasn't able to find nutrition data for many foods I wanted to log. It's far too time consuming to do this manually. The database in mfp is so much better.",

Trying to find foods is a complete 'scratch-your-face-off' nightmare. I have the global search on but finding something as simple as ""nectarines"" was nearly impossible. We also eat a lot of organic foods and no matter what I type after ""organic"" the first option is a tomato basil sauce. I'm so frustrated that I've been using my previous app (mynetdiary) to get my food totals and THEN entering it here.",

This app touts analysis and graphs to map your meal progress. NOPE, you want that, be prepared to fork over $20 per year. Completely misleading description and pictures. I was mainly interested in the Macro tracking and reporting. I find it hard having to manually enter foods I've ate or drinks I've consumed. It's a waste of time and money. MFP works better than this app. Save your money.",
1410,5,2012-11-27T05:44:55.000Z,Proudsoldierswife,Worth every penny!,Definitely an app worth the $2.99 investment.

1447,4,2015-11-23T02:55:47.000Z,Tekantskya,Perffff,It's an overall awesome app to track your daily food intake. You can even set different goals for different days. You can track your weight and even have a circle to follow. I give it four starts because I really need the micronutrients to be tracked too. They're just as important!,

So if I want to measure a bowl of berries by grams instead of cups, I'm out of luck.  Very inconvenient for an app that is supposed to make measuring food consumption and planning very convenient.  Needs a little more thought.",

One update I would like to see is implementing background app refresh so the widget is up to date. As it stands now the new day shows yesterday's data (stale data) in the widget.

I don't particularly like the design of the app or anything of how it works (personal opinion). Other (Free) apps I have had prior would do just as well, if not better, than this app. Wish I could get my money back.",
1530,5,2014-12-26T16:53:26.000Z,danigsoell,Easy to track!,Love this app! Just started tracking macros and this app makes things much easier than MFP. Also love the fact that I can have different nutrition goals and easily alternate.,

Mfp doesn't let you customize unless you pay the upgraded version & so I decided to give this app a shot but once I set my macros & tried logging in my food discovered that logging in grams isn't always available & when it is it's not accurate. Simply logging in raspberries in grams took 2 over 10 mins & the info is incorrect.,
1536,5,2016-07-04T05:38:29.000Z,Jordanhartley777,Excellent,Very happy with this app. It's better than my fitness pal. The only drag is that the pre imported foods that they have in the app aren't that accurate.,

Furthermore, searching for specific foods does not yield accurate results. When I add a banana, I should have the option of adding a whole banana. Instead, this app only offers ounces as a quantity. I guess I'm the chump for paying for this terrible service. I have decided to switch back to one of the free apps that is much much better.",

1619,5,2016-03-27T00:23:05.000Z,Kar1013,Awesome app!,Love this app! Makes tracking macros a breeze. Took a minute to get used to this app (had used MFP previously) but I wouldn't use any other app now. Highly recommended!!,
1620,5,2013-12-28T19:06:18.000Z,Alitalk,Best app available,By far the best diet tracking app on the App Store. Completely customizable to my needs and really helped me reach my goals. 100x better than my fitness pal.,

1623,5,2015-07-07T15:31:53.000Z,Elisa Coon,Pretty Good,"I love the app. I chose it over MFP and it does a good job of tracking my macros. Wish it had more foods in its database and a way to have those food's nutritional value verified. Overall, worth the $3!",
1624,5,2015-08-17T00:55:54.000Z,AlphaSwag480,Great App!,I have been using this app consistently for the past 6 weeks and I am very pleased with it!  Really helping me hit my macros for my goals! Thank you for this fitness tool!,
1625,5,2016-04-17T13:18:09.000Z,Bmacleod90,Can be confusing.,When you first set a goal it is confusing on how to add that macro goal to your main screen but once you get that on there. It's great.,
1626,5,2016-10-11T23:35:06.000Z,Jojo__fit,Love it!,Whenever I want to see some improvements in my physique this is the first tool I use and I always make the changes happen!,
1627,1,2016-11-12T04:57:41.000Z,JensMacros102890,Extremely disappointed,"HATED this app. Really inconvenient. If you misspell or can't remember a brand of a food item, it is impossible to find. I usually log and plan while I'm away from my kitchen so this is so inconvenient for me. MFP worked a lot better. I can't work with an app that doesn't give close suggestions like MFP. Not a lot of food in the database either. Waste of $2.99!",
1628,5,2017-01-16T00:29:29.000Z,ValZ333,User Friendly,This app is very easy to navigate and the barcode scan is very useful! I have shared this with friends and family!,

Barcode scanner still not functioning.  Disappointed.",
1630,3,2013-06-19T18:46:06.000Z,posey55,Good app-would be better with more food choices,The concept of the app is great. Love that it tracks my Macro goals but its lacking in food choices. Most selections are fast food which is annoying. Spending more time imputing food individually than I have with any other app.,
1631,5,2015-09-22T21:41:07.000Z,Scottymoe20,Awesome Capabilities,By far the best app I've used for nutritional info tracking. Tons of cool ways to analyze what your daily nutritional intake looks like. Very user friendly. Highly recommended.,
1632,3,2015-12-30T15:29:46.000Z,Team C.J.,Good but not great.,The user interface is a it cumbersome. For example you cannot enter in custom ingredients while putting together a recipe. You must first separately define an ingredient under another menu then go back into the recipe. Also a glitch will not allow me to enter my height.,
1633,4,2016-01-09T22:16:29.000Z,McCauley84,Solid app!,Search function can be a bit buggy. I also used a different macro calculator and plugged the numbers in manually. Does everything else I need though.,
1634,5,2016-02-02T00:28:40.000Z,JoJoHowe,Makes life easier.,This app is so much easier for tracking macros than any other app I've tried. Totally worth it.,
1635,5,2016-03-22T03:53:57.000Z,shannonap,Great app,This is a simple and effective app. It allows for customization and is simple enough to use. One time purchase and definitely worth it.,

1642,4,2014-12-26T15:27:43.000Z,EmilyOT,Love it!!!,"So easy to manipulate and switch between diet plans on carb cycling days.  The only reason this app doesn't get 5 stars is because the food library isn't that big, but that's not even a deal. Great app & does the trick.",
1643,5,2015-01-08T05:06:17.000Z,Dylan Kight,A must for macro trackers,"Great app. The UI isn't as good as some of the major apps but it is good at what it says it's good at, macros. The layout isn't super intuitive but that's okay. That will come in time I hope.",
1644,4,2015-03-30T13:54:36.000Z,Clasfco,Great app!,"Love the app, very convenient easy to use! The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars it's because it needs an upgrade so that it can include more products when using barcode scanner.",

1647,5,2016-12-22T20:20:32.000Z,Kangator,Great App.,Have used this for 3 months now since being told about it by my nutritionist. Great way to keep track all day long.,
1648,5,2017-01-04T19:26:37.000Z,Wopito,Needs more items in search,Best app by far for counting macros. Database updated this year so many foods can be found by searching,

1652,5,2016-01-10T13:38:45.000Z,Pretzelpenpal,Easy and precise,I use this every day. It's user friendly and more precise for tracking macros than other apps I have tried,

1657,4,2016-12-07T19:15:21.000Z,Fyre1x,Macros,This app has proven super useful for tracking those macros.  I used it in conjunction with my journal for a while but I feel comfortable switching to just the app.  I haven't paired it with the workout tracker yet though,

1660,2,2013-03-28T00:56:26.000Z,Golf1978,Review,Not at all satisfied. Took forever to input food. When I searched for a food it was never what I ordered at a restaurant or the macros were off on the food label of my purchase.  Deleted the app and went to My Fitness Pal which is easy to use and the librarynis awesome. Save your money on the MM+ app. I wish I could get a refund.  This clown stole $3 from me. Smh,

1819,1,2017-01-24T15:16:34.000Z,ThePLAYERway,Inconsistent.,If you cook your own food and don't eat out much the database won't work well for you. Many times barcode scanner doesn't bring up the correct food or servings which makes things difficult. I wouldn't purchase this again or recommend it.,
1820,5,2013-05-29T01:40:43.000Z,Francisco36,Incredible app for those serious about their diet,This is a perfect app for keeping track of macros!,

1824,4,2016-01-16T15:59:55.000Z,Whatluck1025,Nice app!,"Wish it was a little deeper in their food database, but I love the macro count and the day by day planning. MFP was my choice for years, but way too expensive to get the day to day macro plan.",

1828,4,2016-09-17T22:59:35.000Z,Steveo M,Great app but needs to allow different units,"The app adds foods in oz or grams. It needs servings, cups, etc. as options. The units are also not consistent with items that are scanned",

1832,1,2016-06-07T19:59:17.000Z,No One You’ve Ever Heard Of,This app is terrible,"MyMacros+ is probably the least intuitive app I've ever used. Primary actions are hidden 2 and 3 layers deep. Looking up foods is frustrating. Finally, the tool for setting your macro goals just consumes input, it doesn't guide you through any suggestions or help set goals. Truly disappointing. Save your money.",
1833,4,2016-06-26T03:33:09.000Z,D00Dlifter,"Tracking macros works, app needs better lookup and conversions for servings.",Effective practice. App allows good metrics but acts funky finding accurate estimates rather than exact item lookup.,

1841,4,2014-10-23T16:50:06.000Z,LadyPippen,Love it!!!!,I love this app. I get my exact macros instead of percentages which is ridiculously annoying. The only problem is I tell the app I'm female but it keeps changing it to male. Wassup with that?!,

2265,3,2016-07-16T16:16:08.000Z,Findanotherapp,I'm revising my review...no longer five star.,"As of yesterday I switched back to MFP even though I despise ads. At first I loved this app, but as I used it I found it to be glitchy and not as user friendly as MFP, unfortunately. First, the barcode scanner isn't nearly as sensitive as with MFP. It's not a quick process. Second, there are glitchy aspects when I try to manually enter in a food and/or edit nutritional info. Sometimes it works, but often I receive an error message or it just won't allow me to do it or for some wonky reason it defaults to ""almonds"" out of no where. What?!?! Moreover, many times the default serving size is ""1gram."" Now don't get me wrong...I'm totally in favor of the US transitioning to metric units but the fact of the matter is we're not there yet. That means since I'm not massing out every morsel that I put in my mouth, grams would be inaccurate for me. I'm not proficient enough at estimating portions based on grams, even knowing one paper clip is about a gram. Measuring out a certain quantity of potato chips (not grams) works for me, but I'm thinking this app is for people who do literally mass out every morsel. I'm not there yet - I'm alright with a little bit of estimating - and don't know that I'll ever be. Additionally, the food database isn't as expansive as MFP. Finally, MFP has figured out the easiest way for people to use their app, whether it's adding a food, exercise, etc.  This app isn't terrible, but it's not as smooth sailing either. Although I downloaded the paid companion fitness app to sync with this one, I prefer MFP's all-in-one app. I do like that I can see percentages of macros in this app, but it doesn't outweigh what I don't particularly like about the app. Bottom line - although I won't pay the monthly fee for MFP I am switching back.",

After customizing my daily goals it doesn’t calculate the rest of your meals for you. Maybe I just got too spoiled with my last app. Definitely deleting this one and going back to just lose it.

This is great for having high/low days or carb cycling. The issue I had was with finding foods and also manipulating serving size. Other apps let you choose between any unit of measurement but this one restricts you to just one or two.All in all the foundation of the app is great, and much better than others, but the process of actually entering foods and servings needs refinement.

I have watched the tutorials to show me how to log my meals, then I go to log them and it only allows me to log one meal per day. The tutorials are terrible and don’t show or explain you how to continue to add the next meals for the same day. I was only able to log my breakfast and track my water. What a waste of $2.99. Now I have to figure out how to cancel the 7 day free trial for the pro version I signed up before I get charged another $19.99. I’m still working on this too. If I follow the tutorial on canceling my account, it is futile and I get no where. I’ll be upgrading My Fit Pal app instead, it’s much easier to navigate and they don’t charge to just download the app like My Macros + does.",

2406,1,2020-03-17T04:34:40.000Z,EMS21092,Garbage,"App is not capable of basic math. Bar code function only works sometimes. You can scan a bar code and even if the item I’d found it may have zero nutritional values included. I thought that was reasonable, but custom entries don’t calculate correctly either. For example, I created a custom entry that had 240 calories, 20 g of carb and 12 g of sugar. When I applied the item it calculated it at 80 cal, 20 carb and 12 sugar. I capfuls track better with an Excel spreadsheet. Don’t waste your $2.99",

If you want to change the measurement it takes forever, if you scan using the bar code the information doesn’t match the nutrition label. The food library is as over crowded as MFP, no generics from a USDA food database. If you search banana there will be 60 options all vastly different and each in a different measurement. Editing anything is slow and glitchy. Overall this is a great concept with great features but the app is slow and not user friendly. Inputting food takes way too long.",

However, I decided to try the web version, foolishly signing up and paying for the $19.99 annual membership. When I first open the web version, all of my meals which are planned in the app don't show up on the web. When I tried to add my first meal in the web version, I received an error message. After having zero success with the web version, I contacted customer service and I received a response the next day telling me a refund would be processed once I went through the steps of cancelling it via the web site. Well we are going on 3 weeks and I've reached out multiple times and each time I get a response and then it is radio silence. Moral of the story - don't waste any money on the web version, stick to the one time payment of the app or mfp.",

There are mostly pros over the cons in comparison. Hitting macro totals being the primary focus here, and it is easily visible almost everywhere on the screen. It took a bit to get the hang of the format but once I did I'm able to fly through easily. One tweak to consider would be when you try to enter what you plan to eat tomorrow and the day changes, it still says tomorrow until you go back a day and it will change. This app fixes the things that annoyed me about MFP (annoying homepage and difficulty seeing macro targets vs reality).",

2429,1,2018-07-10T13:54:36.000Z,JoeAndyPaul,Needs a ton of work,"Database is empty for the most part. I do like that it is cheaper than MFP. Custom macros and day-to-day goals is a winner for me. You have to pay $49.99 a year on MFP to do that. Fix y’alls database and add more options of how much of something you consume (ex. 1 cup, 1/3 cup, 1TSP of milk rather than just a 1 cup option). If you used 3TSP of milk for a recipe, you’d have to manually compute how many cups 3TSP is. This will save consumers a lot of work, which is the whole point of an app like this. It should be stress free and easy, yet this is the opposite.",

Goal is to gain muscle and get leaner. Only thing I don't like is the lack of exercises that I do in the My Workout + app, it could use some fine tuning.

It makes everything so simple for you plus you can add your own macros depending on what food you are eating.

The only logging option is per single chip. How does one add up all the broken pieces? The bar code scanner quit working. When it was working the bar code scanner did not recognize many common foods. Logging quantity of food intake is about worthless because common units are usually missing as an input. Want to add a banana? The logging unit is one cup mashed. Why no grams or ounces - you know, typical units of kitchen scales. Do not waste your money on this app unless you want to spend all your time working out unit conversions and searching the internet for nutrition data information.",
2468,5,2016-03-11T00:05:37.000Z,fitnessbygretch,Mrs,"I absolutely love this app!! I am a trainer and a figure competitor so I count my macros year round. It took me some time to figure the app out but the more familiar I have gotten, the more short cuts I have found. (The tutorials were very helpful.) I initially liked the app but kept using fit click (on my computer) but because I was going to be traveling over seas for a few weeks — I felt I needed to force myself to get familiar with it as I would be tracking while traveling. I am so glad I did! It has been so easy to track — even on the road! I can’t say enough good things about this app. I find it very easy to add custom foods (which I typically do for all my food to ensure my numbers are accurate) — even w/out using the bar code scanner. Again - I couldn’t recommend this app enough. The only thing I would like to see is a web site that we could use to track that would be linked. When I am at home, working from my computer, using a web page may be a little faster for me but overall - no complaints.",

2470,2,2015-04-22T18:31:44.000Z,Shoegal773,Not worth it,This app does not allow for you to put in your own measurements. If a certain food pops up as a cup but I only had 1/2 a cup you can't input that. Even when bar code scanning. If the label gives info for one tablespoon but I measured & only used a teaspoon. You can't change that either. Therefore I don't feel it gives an accurate total. Some top brands of items aren't listed. Jarrow protein powder. I'm having buyers remorse.,

I love that you can set your goals and it shows you what you've consumed and also what you have left. The food search is pretty good although I did find a few items listed were off from the actual nutrition facts. The bar code scanner is super useful for popular products, I just double check that the amounts are correct. I would love more social options with those in my circle like messaging or commenting.
