0,5,2021-02-20T18:44:41.000Z,worst game ever oof,Amazing app!,"My name is Dhruv and I was a bit fat a few weeks ago but then I came across this app. I started of with the beginners sessions and finished it so that I could go for belly burn. What I found out was I had already burned a lot of calories just with the beginners package. But I did not stop there as I knew that if I had stopped, then my fat would have kept on increasing. So I went for the belly burn. The first package of the belly burn which was the beginners one started out great. The instructor explained all the steps in detail and I got the hang of by the end of the sessions. Then when I started the first session of intermediate, I realised that all the calmness the instructor had in the beginners package took a huge dip. But that was fine as I did understand everything the instructor had explained. Then when I dot to advanced, I realised that this was not easy and that the beginners training would take me up for something like that. But I was impressed as by the end of the whole belly burn package, I had lost over 5 kg.p and I was very happy. So I would easily recommend this app to anyone looking to get exercise, yoga, dance and much more. Thank you for all the support!","We absolutely adore you and your determination, Dhruv! Way to go, buddy."
1,5,2019-07-07T09:00:18.000Z,Sharathshashidhar,Best workout experience ever.,"I have worked out is several gyms for the last 10 years and I must say this is the best so far. In terms of everything from start to finish. If you have a busy schedule and don‚Äôt know what time you can get to gym this is the best as you can choose the time accordingly. Also, you just have to show up to class and they make sure they understand your intensity and suggest easier or tougher variation based on your endurance. The different variations is what gets you hooked. If your idea is to go regularly then try out all the classes and pick and choose what you like. It‚Äôs been 3 months and apart from Sunday‚Äôs I go every other day. The app and software part of cult is amazing, as a software engineer I can totally tell they have done an amazing job. They have the outdoors and swimming pools which are a good addition. You won‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs monotonous at all. Try the yoga classes as well. They are super good and relaxing after a great workout. Kudos to cult.","Thanks for this detailed review, Sharath! You made our weekend :)"
2,5,2019-06-08T18:32:28.000Z,JMMoni07,Worst customer support,Since my stay was for a short while in India I wrote an email asking for one month packages. After patiently waiting for 24 hours I got a reply stating there are one month packs available in the app for your location. I eagerly went and checked immediately and saw nothing but the 6 months and 3 months available. I again wrote to them stating I don‚Äôt see it. After again waiting for 1 day the reply they send me is to reinstall the app from App Store. Which I had already done and sent them a screenshot as well. The next time when I still do not see any one month packages I sent them an email and this time no body even cared to reply to my email.,We apologise for the poor experience. We are constantly working to be better everyday. We hope to give you a better experience next time.
3,5,2019-06-24T05:33:00.000Z,Suman Julka,Just brilliant !,"I am amazed to see the professionalism ingrained from entrance to the exit ... it‚Äôs just mind blowing ; the way eat , plan , fit is put together  ... all is well thought of ... never imagined there will be so minute detailing done on keeping water area too :) just great ... I attended one session and booked and have told 3 people within 12 hours .. I wish the quality is maintained and people are smiling as they are now ; being in‚Äôs hospitality it‚Äôs important to keep fit and energetic people to meet the athletes ( as you call us ) ;).... I lost trust in the good gyms because they hardly maintain quality forever ... also the intelligence is seen when you have opened so many Centers... that‚Äôs really cutting the deal as I always wanted this kind of place but either it was far off from my place or blowing me off .... :) well done ! And it‚Äôs not easy to get complements from new athletes like us ;)",We're so humbled by this! Thank you for writing this review & inspiring us to be #BetterEveryday !
4,1,2019-12-27T14:43:40.000Z,Dr S Nagpal,Food is good but delivery and hygiene during delivery was pathetic. Back to back spilled curries.,"Honestly I have high respect for cult and curefit. But food delivery which is most important these days(specially after cautions deliveries by Swiggy and Zomato) was worst. Remember I am not quoting here quality of food, it‚Äôs the casual packing and henceforth spilling and then enforced delivery and then complain attended by one Mr Deep quoting that only cutlery got spoiled owing to spilling, so henceforth nothing big to cry. Spilling means loose seal and contaminated food, that itself is not acceptable. Sadly spillage spoils your complete order and no one feels like eating that kind of food. Imagine kheer with curry on top. What health man and what calories if open food is kept in a riders bag full of dust.",We're sorry about this Dr Nagpal. We hope to serve you better next time.
5,2,2019-07-30T22:03:06.000Z,nashcheez,"Beatuiful app, has metrics to keep you motivated","The app is very well built. Love how the home screen is pretty minimal only detailing the important info that one needs to glance at any time of the day. Has a good body vitals and step/sleep tracking in built. However, the new class booking section feels less intuitive and too crowded for my taste. I would prefer the previous UI where the class booking buttons were more vibrant and easy to read. The current white background smaller buttons don‚Äôt have that impact. Hence, deducting a star from the rating.",Appreciate your candid feedback. We're always working towards being a better version of ourselves.
6,5,2020-09-19T13:30:48.000Z,Amrapalli K,CureFit is an absolute fire!!,"I have been very whimsical about workouts. Even though I hail from a family with sports background but then too I am not someone who would dedicatedly continue the workouts. CureFit has help me achieve what I have been trying to achieve since a very long time..Motivation. With the variety of workouts, yoga, kickboxing etc. that they have in service is something you do not come across everywhere. The intensity of the exercises and the duration is perfect. The availability of classes at the tip of your fingers in Live classes, is something which is praiseworthy.","Thank you for your encouraging words, Amrapalli! You made our day! Cheers to being better everyday! :D"

I have to get better. Thankyou so much cultfit for live classes. It‚Äôs been almost a year I have started seeing lot of changes in myself because of workout.. hoping to improve more soon.. To increase my stamina to give my 200 percent. Hoping to achieve soon. Looking forward to open cultfit soon.. so that I can try more workouts which I use to think I will not able to do.. the best part that live classes got me a realization I can do any type of üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Thankyou so much for amazing family of cult.. To all the members specially to the trainers and the managers. Really proud to be part of Cult family. üòÉüòçü§©,
9,1,2018-03-21T20:35:28.000Z,Vm0023,Flawed pricing policy,I took 2 trial sessions at cult. I very much enjoyed the class and was motivated to buy their package at the offer price of 9999 for 4months. Which now is 9950 for 2 months. The terms and conditions clearly mention they can take back there offers at any given point in time. The problem is the price manipulation and the frequency they do it at. Company only gives a small window for discounts on smaller duration packages and promotes purchasing a higher package and this is where i got disappointed with cult. From being so advanced with their programs and plans they decided to go with same old business model which every gym follows luring in customers who are first time fitness enthusiasts and recover revenue for a year. Eventually adding zero value to the final customer. They enabled an option to book a session at 450 at the centre? Who wants to pay that much for a session with 10 people? Unable to see the value add though i was a customer at first but highly dissatisfied and disappointed.,Sorry to hear that you missed out on our 4 months offer. We do have an amazing offer running at the moment where in you get 6 months of membership for Rs 13990 against the base price of Rs 27980.
10,5,2018-10-31T01:27:21.000Z,Xpert.,It brings discipline in life,I dont agree with review done by miss damani. I believe. Its good to be disciplined in life. And being on time is first thing. I am not at all a gym person. Too lazy for Work outs and walks. But i joined cult three months back as a trial and i am addicted to it already.  My initial mission was to loose weight but now its just pure happiness. I feel happy through out the day when i spend an hour in the morning working out at cult. Trust me there r no tantrics doing jadu tona to hypnotize u there. They r just hard working trainers who spend their entire day to give u sessions at ur chosen time. I already extended my membership and love working out there. Have a lot to say but will conclude,Thank you so much for your undying support!
11,5,2019-01-12T15:30:17.000Z,Neo345678,Consistency,"First of all, concept is too cool, a revolutionary program for indian fitness. Abt Branding ,absolutely thrilled. Working out since 1 year. No concerns hassles from staff or amenities or customer care.

12,1,2019-03-27T18:58:19.000Z,Deepak763,Cheap business strategy,The classes are good and the offers as well. Most the time they will have 40-50% discount so nothing so get super excited about offer. The pain starts after getting the subscription. They say unlimited classes but u should feel very lucky if u get a single class in your preferred timings(obviously not 2pm in the afternoon ) and location. I get the feeling of IRCTC ticket booking.,"Hi Deepak, this needs a detailed conversation over the phone. We'd like to address all of the concerns mentioned in your review. Please share your contact details with us on hello@cure.fit. We'll get in touch."
13,4,2019-04-08T02:44:46.000Z,AtomicAve001,Excellent experience (few suggestions),"I had an excellent experience using the App. The integration across different areas (Cult, Eat, Cure) is well executed. For example the meals, tests, workout plan are all listed together helping it plan our day. I love how the calories for the food that I order gets logged automatically. Appreciate the sessions available on app for some extra home exercise. Overall I think this is a good app.",

16,2,2020-08-11T04:07:19.000Z,Sean987656,Frequent bugs,"Overall a great app with good features, but there are many of these features that are frequently moving or conflicting ... for eg on PT sessions , we need to know the sessions to be prepped but the session details keeping coming and going every week. You have to toggle multiple screens to gather info. As a feedback, it will be best to keep a single window for all details on a particular workout and an overall dashboard for everything else ... there is also no place to give this feedback on the app. I have been using the app for more than 20 weeks now so this constant bothering has slightly becoming annoying now hence giving a low rating so that someone can take a note and fix .... again, overall much ahead of many other similar apps in terms of bundle of features available just needs to be but more efficient",

This‚Äôs really a multi useful app. Before installing this app I used to be very sleepy,exhausted,lazy but after, my schedule is totally changed. I decided to start workout at home though there‚Äôs no cult center in my place. First I started session for beginners. I was quite excited to do them by seeing the videos. Those videos are absolutely fantastic...the way you elucidate and timing perfection and encouragement brings up a new interest. During my beginning stage, I felt some pain and soreness in my muscles...but I didn‚Äôt give up since NO PAIN NO GAIN!",

However during these times of lockdown when one looks forward to accessing your workout videos, I am never satisfactorily able to view the content on the app even though I have a good internet connection. Firstly, getting to open a workout video seems to be a insurmountable task, and even if you achieve that, it just keeps getting stuck every 10 minutes. Umm..no.. every 5 minutes. It would be really amazing if you could look into this and make watching workout videos a seamless experience. Thanks!!",

I enjoyed the format of workout to choose from, the professionalism displayed by each athlete during the sessions, and the 50 min workout regime that‚Äôs designed to perfection. Things went on as usual and then comes the lockdown due to covid-19, cult takes the country by surprise by releasing a live session workout, and it‚Äôs open to non-members too.

Only few branches have separate area/hall the rest are just open where people walk in with shoes in the mrng and in the evening we put our face on the same carpet while doing yoga .,"Hi Anu, thanks for sharing such candid feedback, it helps us be better everyday.

843,1,2019-03-20T17:58:03.000Z,Akanksha.12,Would never recommend- rigid policies. Money making monsters .,"This was the third session that I was going to attend today. I fully paid the membership for the entire year . I was late for . 7 minutes to my third class due to last minute emergency. I marked the attendance, however was simply denied access to the class by the management. In my previous two sessions, nobody from cult side explicitly told me that you can‚Äôt be even 5 minutes late to any class otherwise entry won‚Äôt be allowed. I politely asked the manager to give me this one time exception as I was not aware of the rules . Also , anyone can have last minute emergency and if that has not been a pattern of that person. Nobody listened and was humiliated in front of the whole group and was simply advised to leave . I am a working professional in the service industry and understands the importance of rules and punctuality . I respect the culture of discipline . However one time exception to that person who wasn‚Äôt even told the proper rules should have been taken into consideration as a courtesy . Top of it , I am paying for the session. Also they have a no show policy , if you don‚Äôt turn up for any class pre-booked , they would reduce the same number of days from the membership duration. A person who is coming late has to come to the class to avoid being marked as a no- show even though entry to the class will be denied . Am I studying in some school ? I understand how a customer treatment and experience can be deal breaker. In this case , it has been for me . I would never ever recommend cult to any of my friends, family members or colleagues.","Dear Akanksha, While bringing in a culture of discipline might be one of the reasons for having such a a philosophy in place. The biggest reason for denying entry to a class after 5 mins is to ensure member safety. The first 5 mins are where the bulk of your warm up happens. A good warm up prevents common workout injuries. Since you've only begun your fitness journey with us, the last thing we want is an injury to disrupt both your personal as well as fitness routine. We truly hope that you understand that our philosophy is not one that's meant to go against you but one that ensures your safety. We hope to see you soon at Cult."

And many more friends along with me. Please do not make me regret my decision for taking the 10 month package. 7 more months remaining of my membership and just to think about not doing zumba is sad! Please do not remove zumba and maintain the same way how it was earlier!,"Hi Naseer, we've been receiving several requests over the past few months for incorporating local flavours in terms of movements and music in the dance based workouts.

They don‚Äôt care about your demands, they only care about their own benefit. I was supposed to get extension for referring a friend to join cult who joined cult successfully but they gave me no extension, even though it was their own marketing scheme. Moreover, I was supposed to get extension after resuming my pack, they first said they will give the extension but they didn‚Äôt do so. I sent them an email again saying they haven‚Äôt given the extension and they simply ignored it. After a day or two, I sent them an email again for them to reply. I legit had to remind them to reply to me. Even then they‚Äôre unwilling to give extension, their records are not updated. They have no clue about the timings I paused and resumed my pack. And the worst part is- they didn‚Äôt comply with their own statements. They said they would give extension, but they didn‚Äôt. There have been many other instances like this. Their customer support staff is highly incompetent.","Hi Nikita, apologies for the back and forth. We see that your pack was extended to Jul 1st. If that is not the case. Please top up the email thread & we'll fix it."

Within a few weeks of joining, they have removed 6 AM classes on alternate days. And the 7 AM class is usually extremely crowded. So now I have signed up for a ten month membership that i cannot use because the administration decided to do away with time slots at their own discretion - probably they do not make profit if the classes are not overflowing. Tomorrow if they do not get enough members, they may cut down on the classes further. Be careful before you join! And don‚Äôt pay for long term memberships!","Hi Priyanka,"
