0,5,2018-10-07T13:03:20.000Z,Crmnvds,So elegant and visually appealing,"What a gorgeous app- that alone makes me want to open it and track. I love that it there's a water tracker, daily fruit and vegetable and weekly seafood tracker and that they give you a life score with details on what to improve each week. Sure, a few glitches like not currently syncing with Health app (I open both then close both and open once more then it tracks), and the recipes and sometimes the database doesn't have the exact food but does have something comparable, just takes a smidgen more work. The beta camera isn't the greatest if you have a deep dish as opposed to a plate but it sure is handy and easy enough to adjust. And there's not many recipes, but the ones available are easy to follow and pleasant to eat, plus how often does one follow a recipe to a T? I've tried other tracking apps (looking at you MFP) and all the ads and monotone color scheme make them too unidimensional- this is beautiful, too beautiful not to use. And the step counter that equates steps to what you burn makes me just competitive enough with myself to make me want to walk even more (I burned 1.5 croissants?!? Bet I can burn 2!). I'd like to buy the app developers a beer. Then go walk said beer off. I saw a couple of review that say the app is rigid in terms of certain foods like sunflowers, and though I appreciate the sentiment, I am using the app for weight loss and do indeed want to know if a food is high in caloric content.",Thank you very very much for your detailed feedback! We are glad to hear that you like Lifesum!
1,5,2018-02-10T14:31:26.000Z,BitsyJo,Beautiful! But could use customized notifications.,"This app is gorgeous! I love the articles and the recipes look absolutely scrumptious. The aesthetics alone are what make this the most effective app, and it is super smooth! Even on this old phone, where everything else crashes. Huge thanks to the devs for achieving this. Now, I turned on notifications expecting reminders to update my water or add my meals and exercise, which would be really nice! Sometimes you get busy and don't track anything; it is the LAST thing on your mind. I did, however, get constant reminders to update my weight. As someone who has a Lifesum of 119 (almost completely perfect! üò≤), I find that a little unhealthy. No-one should be weighing themselves every day, especially if you already have an unhealthy relationship with your weight, body fat percentage, or food. Even on a practical level, it doesn't make much sense. So I turned off the notifications, but it would be nice to be able to select what kind of notifications we get in the future! Such as for new recipes or articles, and reminders in other areas of body and health maintenance. Or a way to change the frequency: Weighing yourself every X amount of days. If there is already a way to do this, I hope the settings for it become easier to find. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks for reading!",
2,4,2021-02-06T23:22:22.000Z,Jackinzi,Beautiful and easy to use with some adaptability issues,"First of all, the visual design of this app is incredible. Other similar apps have designs that make it feel outdated, which in turn can make the data or plans feel outdated even when that‚Äôs not true. Gorgeous color scheme, icons, motion design, etc, and lots of great features like the barcode scanner and ability to quickly select previous days‚Äô meals.","Thank you so much for your positive feedback and kind words, we have shared it with the teams in charge!

3,3,2019-01-30T00:43:11.000Z,stuphunuu,Meal plans impractical,Just downloaded this today and got a premium subscription for 3 mos. Haven‚Äôt been able to do much but most of the features seem nice! I like that it tells you how good certain foods or meals are for you and tracks how ‚Äúon track‚Äù you are. It puts it a step ahead of most other trackers I‚Äôve seen.,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts on our app! The meal plans are designed to be a kick-starter to your diet and are supposed to last a short period of time. It is possible to swap meals throughout the week in order to eat the same meal each day, so there are small adaptations possible. Thanks again for your feedback and good luck with your goal!"
4,5,2019-10-15T00:23:50.000Z,Liccie D,Delete My Fitness Pal!,"I don‚Äôt normally review apps but this is one EVERYONE should definitely try. This is the first app that I‚Äôve actually lost weight with.. it actually helps you develop better eating habits. I know that there‚Äôs a lot of hype behind My Fitness Pal, but I swear, after trying both, LIFESUM BEATS MY FITNESS PAL HANDS DOWN. Nearly everything since the app has gone through updates is perfect. The user-face is simple and easy to use, without the annoying ads other apps have. You can adjust everything to fit your personal goals, even if they go beyond what the app recommends. They even include a macro calculator that makes things easy to calculate. The grading scale is really helpful to see where you can improve. It takes everything into account, calories, macros, sugar, fiber... it‚Äôs pretty comprehensive. Also, I love that I can keep everything private, it‚Äôs not necessarily a competition against all of my Facebook friends. The graphs and diagrams make seeing long term trends quick and easy. One thing I would love to see is something that suggests meals or specific items that would meet the goals of the meal. If I have 200 calories left and haven‚Äôt met my protein, fat, or carbs goals, what can I add to my meal that fits my goals? Other than that, the developers have done an absolutely stellar job.","Hi, thank you very much for your 5 star rating and awesome feedback! We were very happy to read that our app has contributed to your healthier lifestyle and we truly appreciate you sharing your success with us. Our developers are collecting all feedback here https://bit.ly/2gB0KKd - we really appreciate all ideas and suggestions for improvement!"
5,4,2020-10-23T23:34:48.000Z,Kcarrasco09,Fun Macro Tracker,"I really love the design of this app and that you can follow plans that will adjust your macros for you. I also like like that you can capture a photo of your food for each meal, however, unfortunately, this functionality doesn‚Äôt work most of the time. Once I take a picture it doesn‚Äôt show in the app right a way, most of the time I have to take the pic a couple of times, close the app, reopen it and then the pic may or may not show up. So it would be nice if that could get fixed. Also, there isn‚Äôt an easy way to copy a meal from another day to a different meal. So if I ate something for breakfast yesterday, there‚Äôs no  easy way to copy that to lunch the next day. And when searching for foods, your recents don‚Äôt come up. For example, if I wanted to add a food and it‚Äôs not showing in my most recent but I‚Äôve logged it before, it would be nice to have it so up in my search when I go to search the food in the search bar. Another thing this app is missing is the ability to see what foods were highest in each macro. So if I wanted to see what foods I ate that day where highest in fat or protein.. Other macro apps have this, which was nice because then you could see what foods may be bumping up a macro too much or vice versa. Overall I have enjoyed this app and really like the design. However there are a few functionalities that are missing.","Hi there, thank you for the valuable feedback! Please feel free to leave suggestions for improvement on our UserVoice: https://lifesum.uservoice.com. Regarding the photo feature please feel free to email us more details directly at contact@lifesum.com so that we can take a closer look at the matter. Thank you!"
6,5,2020-05-16T12:18:16.000Z,Hwbfowuhrofi,"Awesome, but there are some errors.","I‚Äôve been using this app for as long as I can remember and I recently just upgraded to the Premium, which I love! I love the aesthetic of the app and the visuals and colors it uses. I love the wide variety of recipes, even thought I don‚Äôt use them that much. I love the weekly rating I get so that I can look at my past week and see what I need to improve on for the next one. However, there are a couple things I find I have trouble with. The main thing is that when I go to update my weight, I check on it the next day and it says ‚ÄúNothing lost, nothing gained.‚Äù So whenever I update my weight and maybe i‚Äôve lost a pound or two, i‚Äôll update my weight. But the next day when I go to look at my weight it erased it or changed it back to the starting weight. It does this almost all the time and is pretty annoying because I have to delete the starting weight that it put it back on for that day, at the same time deleting the weight that I put in. Another thing that‚Äôs minor is that when I go to take a picture of my food, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work and the picture never shows up. I do really love this app but I don‚Äôt know if anyone else has the weight changing itself issue or not.","We apologize for the issue you are experiencing.

7,5,2020-10-03T16:56:37.000Z,juneauTracy,Love the app as is but would also love upgrades,"I started using Lifesum to track my intake.  It is easy to use and very visual.  However, there are a couple of upgrades I would like seeing.  First, I would like to see Fat broken down into Total, Sat, Monounsaturated, and Polyunsaturated.  I would also like to see Carbs broken down into Total, Fiber, Sugar Alcohols, Added Sugar, and Net Carbs.  (Currently, the app simply subtracts fiber from total carbs to calculate net carbs.). Also, since I work with a functional medicine professional who is interested in seeing my intake, I would like to see the ability to export data.  As I used to program (albeit mainframe),  I know how long upgrades take to implement; it is possible some of these are already in the works.  They were meant only as suggestions.  Long story short, I am very happy with the app as it is even if it misses some of my personal desires.  Thank you for the work you put in to bring such a useful app to market.  Oh, last but not least, I think it would be better to let users know that full, continued use of the app requires a subscription.  The cost is nominal for the usefulness, but it was frustrating when I first found out about the cost after downloading the app.","Thank you so much for your valuable feedback, we much appreciate it! We have sent your feedback to the responsible teams for their knowledge!"

It is cumbersome to find the food and/or measurement needed for accurate tracking at times; requiring the user to do some creative math or mental gymnastics to figure out what should be entered. I paid for a membership and feel it‚Äôs okay‚ÄîI won‚Äôt likely be renewing. The recipes offer some tasty and decently filling alternatives, but are HORRIBLY written, as often as not. If you‚Äôre not familiar with finagling and ‚Äúfiguring out‚Äù a recipe or if that type of this is frustrating, this is not the app for you. This feels most functional for a few scenarios: first, the casual user who already has a decently healthy understanding of food, quantities, cooking, etc., and is just looking for a little guidance, new ideas for recipes or to literally track calories. Second, any of the diets, I‚Äôd bet, would work if you‚Äôre a person who can follow the recipe EXACTLY (I follow ‚Äúclassic‚Äù and ‚Äúvegan‚Äù but would struggle with both if I didn‚Äôt already have experience eating/cooking alternative foods).  This WOULD NOT be for the user who doesn‚Äôt really know at least some about healthy eating (novice) nor would it be for the serious weight loss/health person (expert) as it just doesn‚Äôt support specifics well enough.",Thank you for the feedback!

9,1,2019-11-23T23:17:36.000Z,BaeNextDoor,Support unavailable,Loved the interface of this app and found it easy to navigate my way around pretty easily when I did use it. The one star rating is due to my recent experience today. I have tried several times now to contact support through the Contact Us (in app chat) link and it continues to crash. The app is updated to the most recent version and so is the software on my phone. Have tried to resend the message several times and the app keeps crashing. I want to cancel my subscription and plan on deleting the app TODAY. I purchased the Premium version of the app about a year ago at a discounted rate during a promo offer they had at the time. They seem to have it set it up where you subscribe to their Premium services outside of iTunes so the subscription is actually processed through their own website. Renewal dates or expiration dates of said Premium services are nowhere to be found anywhere in the app. They then attempt to auto renew it later on at almost $50 USD with no communication beforehand via email or otherwise that they will be processing this amount. I did not even locate the option to downgrade my account or cancel anywhere within the Settings option within the Lifesum app. Luckily my bank caught the attempted transactions as fraud and did not allow them through. I‚Äôll stick to apps that allow me to manage my subscriptions within iTunes to avoid headaches like this.,Thank you very much for reaching out to us!

Don‚Äôt need to weigh myself every single day, and also don‚Äôt need notifications for things I‚Äôve already done (like log breakfast, etc.).

How it is set up now- you have to scroll through all of the days and once you finish one day you have to scroll alllllll the way back down to the next day. Also, not sure if it‚Äôs just a diet they are trying to promote, but no matter what answers I choose when taking the quiz I always get the Keto Burn. I don‚Äôt necessarily have a problem with this diet, I just would like to see what other diets I could choose from that would also be recommended.

I‚Äôve been using it since late December and recently switched to premium a couple weeks ago. While I don‚Äôt regret going premium because of all the additional features, this app is far from perfect. My main complaint is that the entries could stand to be more consistently regulated across the board. Often times I‚Äôll see multiple entries for the same product, all different from one another, yet still all somehow verified by Lifesum with the blue tick. Sometimes the difference in nutrition info between these listings has to do with how the person entered in the serving size, but other times all the nutritional information is out of whack on two or more listings of what is allegedly the same product. This kind of negates the convenience of being able to just quickly search up a food and add it to your diary. I end up adding most of my food manually in order to be sure my entry is accurate. Even when I scan barcodes, I double check the entered nutritional info with the info on the label. All in all, unless this changes and the info on the app becomes more reliable, I‚Äôll probably try another similar app when my membership is up, maybe MyFitnessPal.",Thank you for your review.

If a smooth flow and  easy navigation is important to you this might be a great place to start in your search for the perfect dieting app.  In addition to the look and feel it also has some great content.  My wife and I both tried the Paleo Diet for the first time in our lives. We loved the diet and everything it had to offer.

15,2,2020-09-13T05:07:55.000Z,CSnotLewis,"Awful navigation, terrible tracker","This hets 2 stars instead of 1 because i do actually use it to track, mostly because there‚Äôs little better out there. But the rest of the app is total garbage. It is inaccurate and poorly sourced, confusing to navigate if you want to change your plan, and the nutritional meals are extremely confusing. First, it only allows you to choose one dietary choice. For example, i try and eat a low carb diet but i ALSO want to keep that diet by eating clean and whole foods. But i have to choose one or the other. I am a pescatarian, and for some reason I still get recipes that suggest chicken or other meat. Also the ‚Äúnutritional tracker‚Äù is literally never happy‚Äîyou could have the healthiest meal and it will say you are nutritionally off track because you didn‚Äôt hit *exactly* the nutritional intake it demands to the exact gram. If you have baked salmon, an extremely healthy food with lean protein and omega 3‚Äôs it says the meal is ‚Äútoo high in fat,‚Äù the same as if you had pizza. It doesn‚Äôt differentiate between good fats and bad. There‚Äôs no pleasing the nutritional tracker. It is annoying to search for recipes, and it seems like just a way for celebrity fitness influencers to make even more money when this could be an actual social app for real users to share recipes, exercises, and fitness data. What a waste.","We are very sorry to hear that you feel that way! We will make sure your feedback reaches the responsible teams.

It would be nice if I could import/share those into lifesum without having to manually enter everything one at a time. A few of them have options to add those values to Apple health directly from the app. Lifesum writes data to health, but does not read. I think it would almost be better to separate functions out to apps. Have food apps handle entering / removing data into health and then have trackers reading and analyzing what you just ate so you can make informed decisions. I‚Äôd rather have two clean apps rather than one bloated app. I would imagine narrowing the scope would take out a lot of the overhead needed to maintain and update the app, thus making it even more clean and user friendly. Anyways, this is just my observation after using lots of food tracking apps. The interface may be different but functionally they are all kinda doing the same thing. I would also like to see more support for the Apple Watch when it comes to simple things like adding water and quick calories. The front end of this app is really beautifully done.

However, when you go to enter the food choices several different versions of that food pop up all with caloric differences for the same food.

Another feature that is annoying is if you want to review past food logs, & u leave the app open & go to do something else on your phone if you click back to the app it will reset to you viewing the food log of the current day. Which if you had to scroll back 8 days, you‚Äôd have to scroll back 8 days again even if you just go to do something else even though the app is open which again is annoying & there should be a better way to compare past to future logs.

I like that it offers many different plans and gives you instant feedback on the quality of food you are eating, but many of the features advertised do not work properly. For example, I chose the three week weight loss plan. It generated recipes and a shopping list, which I thought was cool. But it does not let you add the recipes directly to your food diary -- clicking on the recipe did not do anything and I had to enter each ingredient manually, even though I followed the recipe exactly. This seems like a waste of time and a pretty big thing to overlook. Searching the recipe database for the recipe did not work either, as they are organized by tags and not by title or ingredient, making it even harder to find what you're looking for. I had to delete and reinstall the app to even get the water tracker to show up. There is also no way to manually sync the app with Fitbit; it just kind of does it when it wants to, which I also see as a major flaw. It's a beautiful app, but very clunky and full of dead ends. I paid for premium and at this point I wish I hadn't.",Thank you very much for your feedback! The idea behind the 3 weeks weight loss is that the user just has to track by clicking on the meal and not think about calorie counting. That's why the calories are not mirrored in the Diary. But it seems that we have to make that clearer so thank you for your feedback. The trackers do not show in the plan as well but will appear again as soon as you finish the 3 weeks weight loss.

I contacted the developer about this issue but was just told that they were working on it and informed as to how to get a refund and cancel my subscription. That was definitely not the answer I was looking for but may just take them up on it. What I really wanted to hear was a timeframe for getting this right.

It‚Äôs awesome when you track your food and are able to see a rating beside what you‚Äôve had. Also, it‚Äôs very easy to track your exercise. As of recently, I have purchased an Apple Watch and it makes it even easier because it just takes the activity information from my watch and coverts it into the app. There is also a cool weight tracker you can use to count towards your weight goals. Tracking water intake is also nice and the app even gives you tips and encouraging words to reach your water, calories per meal, and exercise goals. I thought every app like this was the same and they all seemed so hard to figure out.

Its not very smart, it doesn‚Äôt have a lot of foods in its database, and the recipes provided are few and not impressive. There‚Äôs no way to find easy meals, it seems to be time consuming and not super appetizing. For example, a suggested recipe to me was a tomato and buttermilk shake?? While that might not be hard to make, it sounds disgusting. Most of these recipes seem to be more about looks and ‚Äúinstagram‚Äù quality than nutrition and simplicity, which is what most people loom to food trackers for. In the app‚Äôs attempt to be more millenial-geared and well-rounded, they made a complicated app with a few flashy features (choosing your type of diet, taking a picture of your food to log it-which didn‚Äôt work when I tried-, and recipes-which have limited options and seem complicated). I wish they offered a trial of the premium but I understand why they don‚Äôt because I definitely wouldn‚Äôt have bought premium if I knew that not much would change, and the additional features are less than satisfactory.

26,2,2020-06-22T23:03:16.000Z,MCinATX,Great for tracking calories. Overall discouraging.,"I read so many reviews to find an app to help me keep track of my food intake when I restarted the 5-2 Intermittent Fasting plan. This app does that, but overall is really discouraging and unrealistic. In 7 days of tracking, I have not had ONE meal that was not labeled ‚Äúimbalanced‚Äù on this app. I‚Äôm either too high on protein or too high I‚Äôm carbs or too high on sugar (ANY meal that includes fruit) and frankly I am already sick of all their frown face icons and impossible standards. Today is my 500 calorie day ‚Äî just finished dinner of a piece of broiled tilapia and a cup of broccoli with a tiny bit of garlic sauce.  Too high in protein and not enough carbs! For goodness sake, I‚Äôm limited to 500 calories! Almost all of my breakfasts have ‚Äúnot enough protein‚Äù, yet I looked through all their breakfast recipes and NONE of the low calorie recipes have the amount of protein they recommend.  Last week on my fast day it said I was too low in protein so I ate a hard boiled egg as my snack ‚Äî and it said it was too much fat. There are no suggestions about alternatives that would be a better choice.  I fear this app has the propensity to lead to disordered eating and obsessing.  Very disappointed and I regret buying a six month membership that is not refundable.","Hi there, thank you so much for your feedback, we much appreciate you sharing it.

However I really have many issues with their nutritional content, so if you‚Äôre needing this for something like diabetes where you‚Äôre doing insulin to carb ratio‚Äôs, or specific dietary needs gastroparesis, reduced fat things, I don‚Äôt think I would recommend it. There are many times where I will scan an item in and what presents on the screen is not what is on the label it‚Äôs really strange. There are other things were a number of carbs the serving size whatever or just incorrect. Not just of labeled items but regular things like banana whatever. Anyway it doesn‚Äôt work all that well when you don‚Äôt have exactly the serving size and even then a lot of the time it‚Äôs just not right. If you don‚Äôt need that level of detail it‚Äôs very easy to use and adds everything up for the day for the meal. They only offer one snack per day so if you have three small meals three small snacks, you just have to lump all your snacks into one snack.

I‚Äôve read that the database isn‚Äôt as big as MFP but I haven‚Äôt run into any problems with being able to track my food or scan barcodes. When I first started using the app I lost 8 pounds in the first few weeks, so I‚Äôm finally under 160lbs! I haven‚Äôt been very consistent recently but I‚Äôve just picked it back up again tracking calories and staying under my daily goal. I also love how simple it is to track macros. Overall, I‚Äôve been wanting to lose weight for YEARS and stop gaining 10lbs/year on average and this is the FIRST tool I‚Äôve found that has actually helped me make progress. Only negative I have is the meals on the different plans can‚Äôt be changed so I can‚Äôt really do them because I‚Äôm allergic to shellfish (I could probably just substitute though LOL)",Thanks a bunch for your feedback!

Unlike most of the other ‚Äúsuggestive criticisms,‚Äù though, my chief complaint/wish is that there are never any ‚Äúnight shift mode‚Äù capabilities in health tracking. Many of us in healthcare like me and hundreds of other careers have had to switch their lives nocturnal. 24-hour gyms and grocery stores have helped, but there is still so much room for improvement! If there were just a way to tell the apps to switch from breakfast/lunch/dinner at 8-ish, 12-ish, and 6-ish to those equivalents during the night!

You can‚Äôt customize the macro goals unless you have premium and mine are different from the ones they set for me. The one thing that really irks me is their meal rating system. It doesn‚Äôt teach indulgence in moderation, which I think is key to maintaining a healthy diet, and it doesn‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense. If you eat one sweet thing it ruins your entire meal rating. For example: I had scrambled eggs and protein powder in coffee this morning ‚Äî it gave both of those an excellent rating on their own, but didn‚Äôt give the meal as a whole a good rating because I hadn‚Äôt consumed enough calories. Then I had half a serving of honey vanilla Greek yogurt and it gave it a :| rating, which then ruined my whole meal rating. And you can get an explanation for why things are rated that way unless you pay for premium. I try to get good ratings all day so it really bugs me when I get a bad one.

It works to keep me accountable and mindful of my choices without restricting anything. I like that it connects to my Apple devices and adjusts my available calories based on exercise (the more I exercise, the more I can‚Äôt eat)! That feature has been very helpful. The scan tool works mostly well but there have been several items not yet in their database. There is an option to help grow that if you take the time to enter in all the nutritional info on a package. The most difficult thing with this (and all the food logging apps) is entering in homemade food, e.g. the chicken noodle soup I made last Sunday... other than that, I give it 5 stars and will continue to use it.

If I‚Äôm going to have the ease of using a barcode, why do I have to put in more work? If you want to be able to accurately measure and count calories, you should use grams. When I use grams on anything, the measurements are totally inaccurate. They‚Äôll make something that should be 200 calories look like 12,000 calories.

However, if there is one thing that really ruins my experience, it‚Äôs that you cannot view the nutritional values. It is illegal for packaging companies to withhold nutritional facts, and chain restaurants have to offer nutritional values for their food as well in order to ‚Äúhelp Americans be healthy‚Äù. So why is an app, specifically designed for dieting withholding that information unless you pay for it? I think this is actually quite unjust. Yes, they do display protein, carbs, and fat, however the rest is blocked. The second problem with this app is that there is limited choices for entries. What I mean, is that if you try to log an exercise, there are many that are not included so you must guess on the amount of calories you burned.

Beyond that, it gives you recipes, weekly ratings (in premium version, but the free version is well worth the download too) on how balanced and healthy your diet is, what you can improve on, and even gives you additional trackers for the areas you‚Äôre working on.

Even though I scanned the exact items I was using to try to make it more accurate, it was saying my bread had half the protein and double the calories is really has, then for my plant milk says it has 27 grams of protein instead of 10? Very confusing and completely wrong. It also gave a better rating to my vegan Caesar dressing than HALF of a small avocado and celery.. Also I put that my food preference was vegan and every single meal suggestion it gave me wasn‚Äôt even vegetarian, they were all meat? It‚Äôs also inaccurate for the amount of protein you need, it shows that I‚Äôm low in protein because it says I need just under 100 grams a day which is literally double what I need for my weight? I feel like I can‚Äôt trust it at all and it‚Äôs honestly annoying how even when you scan the item it doesn‚Äôt pull up the correct nutrition facts and the ratings are so off. Like Caesar dressing is really healthier than celery and avocado.. definitely not a good app. Disappointed.","Thank you for your feedback.

The original reason I downloaded this app what is to integrate it with the Walgreens app in order to earn bonus points at that store. Once I open the app, I found it useless. I took all kinds of quizzes which were to determine my eating habits and to suggest diets. I can‚Äôt imagine why eating vegetables watch a week or fruits just three times a week would indicate a balanced diet. Then it offered to give me suggestions. After every quiz, in order to get the answers or suggestions or meal plans or diet suggestions I was directed to sign up to get the paid version. This app is a complete rip off. I don‚Äôt have to take the time to go onto my phone just to keep track of how many glasses of water I drink! I have chronic kidney disease and was looking for a few other suggestions. Since I have to pay for everything here, I‚Äôll stick to the FREE Davita app. It‚Äôs easy to set your calorie goals (along with protein and other nutritional content). You don‚Äôt have to have CKD to use Davita, either. Their food database is enormous.

It has some great Keto recipes and gave me planned meals complete with a grocery list for the whole 3 weeks. I really like the look of this app, especially over MFP. However, I find myself unable to do all of the functions that I could in the former. Mostly, editing or even deleting a custom recipe/meal-- I can only add them not get rid of them. Most importantly however, there's issues transferring a tracked meal the app suggests from my paid meal plan into my food diary. The servings get all messed up and the nutritional information gets significantly reduced. This makes me go back and delete/""untrack"" the meal and input it manually, which defeats the point of the feature. I really want to like this app but unfortunately I will not continue using it after my paid trial ends.

68,3,2020-11-20T00:17:13.000Z,AlphaWithLove,Why can‚Äôt you delete meals or food?,The premise of this app is great and when it starts listening to Apple health to factor in your exercises it really sets itself apart. Our issue appears to be more of a bug than a missing feature: you can‚Äôt delete any meal once you add it. We are in a Keto focus and we cook all our meals from recipes we create (we have a personal menu). When we create a meal with all of the ingredients it exists in the ‚ÄúMeals‚Äù section as a choice we have from now on to enter into our diary any given day we may have chosen to eat that meal. But there are meals we made years ago when we tried this app once and didn‚Äôt know much about nutrition. And we can‚Äôt delete them. A meal just consisting of black beans is in there forever cluttering the list and it can‚Äôt be deleted. The same problem occurs in anything added in the food category. It makes daily use of this app cumbersome and overtime it will become so crowded that it will be unusable,"Thank you for reaching out and leaving your feedback!

69,2,2019-08-10T22:30:29.000Z,aretephora,Beautiful UI but not remotely functional,"Giving two stars for the UI. Very visually appealing. But not functional. Lots of basic issues that constrain functionality. 1) you must log water by 8.45 ounces and can‚Äôt change that. 2) if you choose one of their diets, you can‚Äôt edit the calories. I was on the 5:2 diet and it had me eating 1600 calories on non-fasting days. I‚Äôm doing 1400 calories, but there‚Äôs no way for me to change that. And none of their plans allow for different calorie goals for different days. 3) app crashes a couple times a day and I have to log out and log back in. 4) the food insights are very limited. They tell me my nutrients are imbalanced if my meal is a couple grams over/under with one macro. 5) most scanned foods come out with incorrect information. 6) can‚Äôt move foods from meal to meal or day to day. 7) doesn‚Äôt show you the foods you eat regularly, have scanned recently, or generally prefer over others.

My main issue is with adding foods for the next day. I often meal prep and input my food the day before so I can plan for the day ahead at work. However, many times I think I am putting in the food for the next day but the app adds the food to the current day instead. It happens over and over again and it takes me twice as long as it should to meal prep. I really hope this can be fixed or an option is added which allows you to change the day and/or meal on the food itself (the weight watchers app allows this).","We apologize for the issue you are experiencing.

I will say though I‚Äôm a little surprised there is no paleo option and it feels super focused on Keto. I‚Äôm paleo based, so while I wanted to try out the plan choices, I just stuck with the classic because they aren‚Äôt close enough. With options in recipes too, if they could add in an avoiding soy section, I‚Äôm sure a good portion of their users would appreciate it. I also wish I could customize the water tracker since I drink two 40 oz hydroflasks of water a day and it doesn‚Äôt really let me accurately track that. And also the macro counter would let me input my macro goal since it was over 100% according to the app.. I‚Äôm in a bulking stage, so it was a little frustrating having to adjust it just to track in the app. Overall though I still like it better than MFP.",Thanks for the feedback!

It‚Äôs very appealing and simple to use and i love the personalized diet plans which are the only positives it has over the other app I am comparing it to. In terms of everything else, I truly prefer MyFitnessPal. I hate the fact you can‚Äôt multi add foods when adding your meals for the day. The most irritating thing about this app is the lack of consistency/accuracy when tracking foods. It seems like most of the foods in this app aren‚Äôt verified and are completely based off of users creations. MyFitnessPal adds a healthy mix of both verified foods and user added meals. For example, I had Chipotle for dinner and I wish I could be able to choose ingredients with verified nutritional facts from the restaurant. Also, it‚Äôs unhealthy and irritating to be told to update your weight every single day.

For a number of months I was in a bad relationship with food‚ÄîI was a binger and a restricter. This app helped me overcome this so quickly. What's different about this app from others is that looks much more in-depth than most free nutrition apps. I recommend the subscription for the whole experience, but even without it, it's very helpful. I am now numerous weeks clean from binging because this app gives many more notes. It informs you for approximately how many calories you should be eating per meal, the balance of macros, and the nutrition/rating of food. It even gives you a complete rating for your meals and day! I've tried MyFitnessPal, but it never really gave as much info as this app. It really is a helpful app, and I completely recommend it!",

With LifeSum, you get high-level overviews of what you‚Äôre eating along with easy, actionable ways to improve your diet. By contrast, with MFP and Cronometer, I would often get so caught up in the minute details that I wouldn‚Äôt know what to change in my diet. LifeSum strikes a much better balance of giving the details most people need without overwhelming you with data. I highly recommend LifeSum if you‚Äôre someone who gets obsessive when using other apps because I‚Äôve found it to be much gentler on my mental health (although please talk to a doctor if you have a history of disordered eating because any kind of calorie counting can be touchy)",

All you have to do is scan a barcode and bam, all the info is in there and you can easily track what you‚Äôre eating and your macros. It‚Äôs also extremely easy to add your own items if they aren‚Äôt in the system, or if it‚Äôs a home cooked meal you made. I highly recommend this app! I‚Äôm trying to lose weight in the new year, and this has really opened my eyes to how much fat and sugar and crap I was eating that I thought was healthy.

For example any keto eater knows an avocado has a low amount of net carbs. about 4 per avocado. this app logs it as 17. it does not minus the fiber despite me confirming that I am tracking NET carbs. :/ so I cannot track my food. chia seeds it says a huge number of carbs. it does not minus the fiber. so basically if you need to know your true macros then this database is not so good. I redownloaded carb manager app today and wow the avocado has less than 4 grams net carbs. now I know I can eat it and not worry. and chia seeds is accurate on that app (carb manager app) too so I recommend switching to a better app and for the makers of this one to fix the data so it is not only an app with good looks. thank you.",We are sorry to hear this!

HOWEVER, if you are expecting to use Apple‚Äôs Health app to sync data from Lifesum (which the app claims to do), then skip it. While Lifesum does record and sync data to Health, its consistency is not reliable at all. Data may sync to the Health app for a couple of days, but for some reason, it will skip other days entirely. But more annoyingly, on days that it decide to sync data, it will sometime not sync every category which you have selected (i.e. water intake, sodium, sugar, etc.). Additionally, the app will sometimes glitch and erase data which you have recorded INSIDE of the app itself.

Unlike MyFitnessPal, which is the easiest food logging I‚Äôve ever done, Lifesum is not only difficult in finding the food you‚Äôre trying to log (they don‚Äôt have the database that MFP has), but the serving sizes and entering the amount you‚Äôre eating is more often in grams instead of cups or the MUCH easier options on MyFitnessPal. A lot of the nutrition information is also wrong, meaning that I have toggle with the ‚Äúamount‚Äù of food that I ate in order to get the calorie count correct. I also don‚Äôt love the often negative feedback that pops up if you occasionally eat something that‚Äôs non-nutritious.

Its integration with other apps like mySugar is a great idea, but it‚Äôs limited in some ways. 1) The inability to make necessary adjustments to information such as meal time. This is an unnecessary constraint on a paid app. I use lifesum to track and plan my meals along with my insulin intake, and this restriction on specifying meal times makes much of my data charts worthless. 2) When exporting the carb counts to other apps, it automatically excludes carbs that it has not verified, even if I have entered the numbers myself. There should at least be the option to include all data. 3) The app is often buggy. It crashes upon opening, and food input sometimes simply doesn‚Äôt work. Clicking to add an item results in a blank field that then disappears. A paid app should not have these problems.","We apologize for the issue you are experiencing.

As someone who is going to school for nutrition and has a few friends and family who have tested all sorts of things; with different weights, metabolisms, and health, we all can agree that carbs and even protein are not good for us in the least by not raising our insulin too much.

For instance, it locks you into a ‚ÄúClassic Plan‚Äù that has macros and a calorie count that doesn‚Äôt fit with my current lifestyle and I can‚Äôt adjust them because it‚Äôs locked into a membership.

Then when the trial ran out all it did was count up calories and basic nutrients like sodium and sugar.,"Hi there, thank you for your feedback!"
128,1,2020-10-11T17:16:40.000Z,CorgiRunner,Regret I paid for premium,"I really want to like this app because it is very attractive, unlike MFP.  However, it needs a lot of work, especially the recipe function.  First, I found a lot of mistakes in the database, too few/many calories etc, and no way to report errors, unlike MFP.   Next, the recipe function keeps making the app crash and when I finally get a recipe entered, there is no way to edit it later.  For instance, you use a different brand a cheese the next time you make it, you can‚Äôt correct the calories/nutrition. Next, there is no website availability so you have to enter recipes in the app and personally, I can type much faster in a keyboard than a mobile device.  Last, but not least, there is no recipe import function so you do HAVE to enter each ingredient and instructions by hand, unlike MFP.  So while MFP may not have the glitzy, cutesy presentation, it is HANDS DOWN a much more functional app even without paying for their premium membership.","Hi there, we are sorry to hear that you feel this way but thank you for your feedback! Regarding the database and reporting errors there is a function for that; When you're in detailed view of a food item, please scroll down to the bottom of the page until you see the Report button.

I was so excited that I even bought the yearly subscription. After a day I regretted it. The food database is incomplete and not accurate. For example I was tracking for a few days and was wondering why it said my fats were so high...it said a serving of grilled chicken breast had 20 grams of fat.....the scanner doesn‚Äôt work either so you‚Äôre out of luck if you can‚Äôt find. The ‚Äúrating‚Äù gets irritating as well. If you‚Äôre trying to center your carbs around when you workout it‚Äôll constantly tell you that you‚Äôre off track because your macro distribution. Would also like to see an app that has the option of Meal 1, Meal 2, Meal 3, Meal 4, Meal 5 etc. rather than breakfast lunch dinner snack. Will be going back to my fitness pal. I just wish I hadn‚Äôt spent 50 dollars on a year subscription (which adds near no value to the app)","We are very sorry that you feel that way! If you prefer a refund, please contact us directly.

134,2,2018-12-19T18:06:13.000Z,Sgabel,Unreliable Diet Information & Poor Functionally,"The app itself has a very nice layout. However the functionality seems to be very wonky. For example, one day it says my calorie intake should be1650, the next day it say it should be 500. Not sure what to make of this. Based off two other apps I‚Äôve tried, my goal intake is around 1250 calories. The other thing I noticed was for the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù Keto Diet, it was showing 80% carbs, 5% fat and 15% protein. Anyone familiar with the Keto Diet knows this is incorrect. Finally, one feature I liked was the 3 week weight loss plan that would show menus for the week. The day after I paid for the premium version, this feature was no where to be found. So far I have found this app to be very confusing and not at all accurate with the information it is supposed to track which is diet. Carb Manager is great for those focused on the Keto Diet and MyFitnessPal for all other diets.","Thank you for rating our app and for your feedback. We are sorry to hear that you find our app confusing! The  3 week weight loss plan requires specific settings in order to be available to you https://bit.ly/2A5T6Co.

This is one of many tracking apps I‚Äôve used before, but this is the first I loved so much that I paid for the premium version. I love the idea of the plans, BUT, I so, so wish I could swap out a single ingredient in each recipe. I follow a vegan diet, but the plan offered for vegans is very limited. Instead, I like to follow other plans, but swap out proteins or cheeses for vegan options. I would LOVE to see an option where I can go into each recipe and swap these out rather than having to fill in the whole recipe myself just because of one substitution. This would also help when making sure I‚Äôm getting as much protein/calories as the meat option would have. Please add this feature; it would help the app become more vegan-friendly!",
137,5,2021-01-08T16:06:18.000Z,I don't know...Username?,Overall Such a Great App!,"I really enjoy this app! I initially downloaded it to help count macros because I am vegetarian and sometimes struggle to ensure I get enough protein every day. This app helps keep my protein intake (and fat and carbs) top of mind. One thing I wish I saw more was I take of other key nutrients - like fruits and veggies, which currently are just counted for carb intake. Since all carbs aren‚Äôt created equal, it would be helpful if carbs such as breads and pasta were differentiated from sweet potatoes and greens, for instance. But, a great thing it does do is account for added and naturally occurring sugars, so that helps a bit with fruit sugar vs pasta, packaged goods, etc. I also love the barcode scan function. All in all, I plan to use this app for a long time. Good work!",Thank you so very much for your positive feedback! We are very happy to read that you are satisfied! We will forward it to the responsible team for their knowledge.
138,1,2021-06-26T05:17:41.000Z,Caligrl24,Very disappointed,"I am so beyond sick of fighting with this app. If you care anything about tracking your macros correctly- go with myfitnesspal. I‚Äôm frustrated that I upgraded to premium only to hate this app so much, I dread using it. Everything I scan- has the wrong info and often times the barcode is associated with the wrong food item. So I edit each time, carefully putting in the exact info off the food packaging, only to have it tell me calories etc are wrong and not allow me to save it! Why bother?  I also hate that it won‚Äôt allow me to track other things, like vitamin content- except for potassium. Also a joke that it won‚Äôt allow you to remove food items you create, or most of all, edit them. Which is exactly why you see so many duplicate items created by ppl on here. I know I sometimes change my recipes up, so why not allow me to change it on here?  This app has been around too long to be this dysfunctional.","We are very sorry to hear that you have had a bad experience with our app and we appreciate your feedback. It is absolutely possible to edit and remove your created items - you can do this by entering the item through Favorites, not your Diary.

It‚Äôs a  beautiful user interface, which was the initial appeal for me as a user. However, without the ability to access simple data from my food intake, this app is not as useful as I would hope for it to be when tracking more than just macros. Calcium, magnesium, and so many other minerals that should be easily imported on the developer side (I am familiar with development), but somehow, even with a user forum requesting such simple tracking, and for years now, this data is not available to users. The alternative for tracking not just macros but the various minerals we need to survive and thrive is My Fitness Pal, which is free, for my purposes at least. I will happily return as a user when these simple yet essential pieces of data are shared and easily accessible as well.",We are very sorry to hear that you feel that way! We will make sure your feedback reaches the responsible teams.
140,4,2018-01-18T19:17:16.000Z,Gymgoer4813,Love it- but a few places for improvement,"The app is beautiful - which may be shallow but the design has certainly made me want to engage with the app far more than other food tracking apps I‚Äôve used before. The reminders and prompts are helpful and motivating, and Lifesum offers a lot of easy-to-select plans (keto, 5:2) that I was interested in. I‚Äôve paid for the 6 month subscription and am using the 5:2 plan. However, the food database to search from is far more spotty than Myfitnesspal and I‚Äôm putting most of my food in manually, and I am unable to move around my fast days throughout the week to account for my schedule, which causes some really discouraging feedback from the app when I‚Äôm either blowing my fast day calories or way under eating on a non-fast day.",Thank you very much for your feedback!

It‚Äôs hard because I work overnights and I log my dinners as breakfast and so on but it does help me maintain accountability of my food.  I like being able to find the foods I eat from popular restaurants to foods I prepare at home.  My favorite part of the app is being able to scan the barcode of the food I prepare and input my portions.",Thanks you so much for your positive feedback!

142,4,2018-04-26T11:17:30.000Z,jadeycakes777,Overall amazing,Overall I think this app is amazing. I love the reminders and the weight tracker. I love the label scanning and entry capabilities. I love that you can track for different types of diets. Where I think this fell short is in the Keto diet tracking area. I track net carbs and yes it does track them to a certain degree. I occasionally buy low carb treats with three and under in the net carb department they are higher carbs but the majority of carbs are sugar alcohols which should be subtracted from the overall carbs just like fiber to get the net carb total. Like I said overall an amazing app just needs a little tweaking for net carbs to calculate correctly. I should add that I don‚Äôt buy apps but I did purchased this for the three month timeframe to try it out and will definitely be purchasing for the next time frame!,"Since we do not support sugar alcohol in our app our approach can differ a bit from other net carb calculators. There is no ""true and only"" way though."
143,3,2019-01-15T14:54:54.000Z,emmytobias,Wish the food entries were more accurate,"I like that this app allows me to make low carb/keto choices without judging me for consuming too much fat (*cough*MFP*cough*). I also like the premium feature of following a plan with recipes and guidance.  The app is beautiful in design. But I feel like if I‚Äôm going to pay for a food/diet journal app when there are sooo many free ones to pick from, the food entries need be accurate. I find myself fixing a lot of foods and barcodes in this database. And making a food a favorite should be right there on the nutrition facts breakdown‚Äîit‚Äôs not straightforward how to access recents or favorites. If I hadn‚Äôt paid for a 3mo subscription, I probably would have returned to another app by now for the convenience of a user-verified and more accurate database. A little more tweaking on the UX and accuracy of this app and it will be the bomb.","Thank you for your review - we truly appreciate you sharing your thoughts on our app and we have forwarded your feedback to the team!

This makes it difficult to track on dieting. I‚Äôve had this app just 2-3 days of premium subscription and I feel it‚Äôs just not for me. The app isn‚Äôt really accurate on intake on calories. I‚Äôve already paid for the subscription for a year, so it‚Äôs a waste of my money now which I paid for a year. The amount of water someone should take is helpful. Also, for someone to be using this, you have to have a decent income to buy most of the healthy products suggested to stay on track of diet plans. For myself I‚Äôm a student, so this is kind of difficult since I don‚Äôt make that much while going to school with a part time job.

There are only 3 main meals that should be of large portions and a really small snack. However, I eat more meals but in smaller portions and the way of submitting your food when you eat like me gets difficult.

While there‚Äôs a lot to like about Lifesum, the app has many flaws. Mine has not synced with Apple Health since mid-December, despite several reinstallations as instructed by customer support. It displays my calorie count as the next day, for some reason. And the food search needs work. Entering something as standardized as a Chipotle order involves searching through dozens of entries for the same ingredient, all with different calorie counts. I‚Äôve tried editing foods to correct them, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to work either. All in all, Lifesum is better than the My Fitness Pal app, but it needs work.

But I would like to see a space where I can upload progress pictures along with my weight and the ability to turn off weight log reminders because I‚Äôm personally not big on tracking what the scale says or setting a ‚Äúgoal weight‚Äù when I‚Äôm just focusing on gaining muscle and eating healthier.

But this newest update is absolute garbage. I reached out to lifesum support and followed their recommendation to delete and reinstall the app. However, now the app is choosing to import my Fitbit data for random days! So now it looks like I have a ton of days where I ate hundreds of calories over my limit because it is missing my Fitbit data (I consistently reach 10k steps nearly every day). I have tried everything listed in the FAQ and nothing works. I feel as if I have lost all of the progress and work I‚Äôve put into this app and my lifestyle for months now .... I am tempted to just delete this app and go back to myfitnesspal. Hopefully you guys in app development will figure this out soon!!!",Thank you very much for your feedback!

Don‚Äôt worry, they don‚Äôt show you anything really on the basic plan. Literally you can look at some meals, and you get a free workout and meal diary... that is it. If you go with the premium you get recipes and tons of other perks. The dilemma for myself and so many others is that I have such a restricted diet I don‚Äôt know if your app allows all my preferences. I am not signing up for anything without knowing what EXACTLY I am getting in return. $30 to hope that you can provide the recipes I can actually eat??? Pass. This hopefully works for many who do not have serious restrictions but for those that do you are asking us to throw our money on a very unlikely bet.","Hi there, that you for your feedback.

The benefits for paying $30+ a year aren‚Äôt normally enough to make me go premium, but I would just to support the work of the team building lifesum. The ONLY thing keeping me from upgrading is the weird payment system. It‚Äôs monthly but managed by where you upgraded (iTunes or website) and the only way to cancel is to take it up with Apple, or whoever handles the payment. If canceling a subscription with lifesum directly, it looks like you email them and hope they‚Äôll come through on manually cancelling. It‚Äôs just not worth the potential headache later. I would rather pay a one-time fee than deal with a weird, fragmented subscription model.","Thank you for your positive review!

It‚Äôs difficult to determine because the app seems to have a delightful unisex interface. However articles and content posted by lifesum are geared towards females with almost all imagery being that of women and article titles like ‚ÄúEat Like A Goddess‚Äù. Great health isn‚Äôt bias, but the sex of an individual will affect it. I assume this is why the customizable features within the app are available. That in conjunction with the unisex interface should be more of a reason to creat an app geared towards everyone to enjoy.

However, the functionality is where I feel Lifesum falls short. I was a loyal MyFitnessPal user for years and I decided to try Lifesum Premium to see if I liked it. The small library of food items and the difficulty through which food is logged proved to be too cumbersome for something that I KNOW can be easy, as it is through MyFitnessPal. The ‚ÄúMeal Plans‚Äù include eating 500 calories for 1 or 2 days a week... yikes. Every nutritionist will tell you that starving/fasting yourself is terrible for losing weight and your metabolism. The recipes are not worth premium, in my opinion. (Boiled eggs with mayonnaise as an exampleü§Æ) I tried Lifesum for about 2 weeks and I will sadly be going back to MyFitnessPal, even though I have 2 months left of Premium on this app.","Thanks for your feedback. We never recommend something that would not be health beneficiary, including the 5:2 diet that has 2 fasting days a week in the plan. Research has proved that a short fasting period has a positive impact to your health and that people who follow this lifestyle tend to lead longer lives. There are many other plans available to choose from if that is not your thing! Our food database is improving constantly. It is partly user-created and that results in some items having inaccurate nutritional values. We recommend that you either select items verified by us or, for items that you cannot find in our database, create custom items under Favorites. Find out more here: http://bit.ly/2CSyBYp."

As I was playing around with it for the first time I noticed that many of the features were locked and I need to buy premium in order to use them. Every time I saw something that I wanted to know or a feature I wanted to use, it was locked. Then I realized that without premium there is little the app can do. I think it would be nice to have a month or few week long free trial to test out premium before committing to paying for it, or something like that. Or, the app can just unlock some of the great features that made me download the app in the first place. For example, the camera to take a picture of my meal would save so much time!","We are charging for some of our features in order to cover our running expenses, which include a team of designers, developers and nutritionist and a total of over 60 employees.

It‚Äôs just not worth that. I like the look of it, it‚Äôs not too difficult to navigate. But, every time I scan a food item, it is either not in the system and I have to add it, or the nutritional information or measurements are incorrect. (Sometimes the calories are correct but it says the standard serving is 1 cup instead of 1 tbsp, etc). I would say this is the case for 85% of foods that I add to my day and it gets so frustrating having to change everything. I wouldn‚Äôt mind having to add a new food or correct something every once in awhile, but I feel like it happens literally every day.  Even items from big companies like Quaker are not in the system sometimes. Pretty disappointing considering how much I paid.","Thank you for your feedback.

The recipes are VERY vague. Often with ingredients measured in ‚Äústandard serving‚Äù or in grams. The ingredients lists are either odd or so short that I was constantly adding to the recipe to give it flavor. The instructions more or less just say ‚ÄúCook food and eat it‚Äù. There‚Äôs no way to add a custom meal on the food tracker so tracking an actual meal you cooked is a huge pain. There are various diet plans to choose from but very little explanation on how to actually live within that plan. Also the meal plan itself is a pain to try and navigate in order to plan and meal prep.

When I downloaded the application, I was immediately amazed by the beautiful interface. Carefully designed and crafted, Lifesum includes everything you need to lose weight. It motivates you to stay and eat healthy when your about to go off track. It also makes sure you eat well. If you don't drink enough water, it sends you a notification of what you have done and the affect is has on your diet. So far I have lost 5lbs with Lifesum in the first week, so I'm very excited for future progress ahead.",Congratulations! We are happy to read that you are satisfied!

I am on the Mediterranean diet now only because it allows me to set my own fat, protein, and carb intake (I am ACTUALLY on a Keto diet) but in the diary it only suggests calories and I have to calculate the fat, protein, and carb myself for my meal preps.  Once I input into the diary the app does the calculation but it would be more useful if it shows it in advance so I can immediately measure out my portions.  Also, the available Keto plans lock the carb count so I can‚Äôt put in my individual carb grams and percentages.  Hopefully, the app team will address these two issues in the very near future.",Thank you very much for your review and feedback!

I have tried to use it anyways since I‚Äôm paying for 6 months (whether I like it or not) and now the app keeps crashing randomly when I try to view the plan section.

I just got out of a 3 month long stay in inpatient and residential ed treatment at 15 years old and am still in a partial hospitalization program. This app lets you set ridiculously low calorie limits and doesn‚Äôt fight you on them with more than a notification that the goal is too low. In addition it sets your original goal at 1200 cal which isn‚Äôt even enough to feed a person in a coma. We need at least 1400 per day to exist in a coma and at least 2000 per day to exist a normal life. It encourages people to eat way under the amount their body needs.

If you put in all the effort to track your meals you really become more aware of what your eating and how many calories it is. The reason I only put 4 stars is because they give you a lot of pop ups for their plans you pay for and I was really just looking for something free and easy to help me feel more self confident. This app is totally free unless you chose to pay for one of the special plans which I don‚Äôt intend to do. I would say the free version is probably better then the paid plan.

Yet if you cook, there‚Äôs no means (certainly not an intuitive one) for putting your own recipes into the app. So if you make, for example, egg roll bowls (essentially the innards of an egg roll, but as a stir fry/salad without the shell), you have no practical means of just entering ‚Äú4 oz golf egg roll bowl‚Äù based on a pre-entered recipe with its nutritional info. That makes the product useless as a food diary unless you totally rely on the lazy forms of food a good diet plan should encourage you to avoid. Disappointing. Will reconsider if you can explain (and make way more visible) a way for entering your own recipes.

The premium version has very limited functionality, and trying to enter real food is a battle that just isn‚Äôt worth fighting. It seems to think that all food comes from restaurants instead of my own kitchen. Too bad if you didn‚Äôt have a side of potatoes with that omelette. The app just decided that you did and you‚Äôre stuck with a food journal that isn‚Äôt representative of the actual food that you actually ate. And just try adjusting your macros to something you would want to track. The app pigeon holes you into one of a few predetermined meal plans and expects you to stick to that.

On a low carb/keto diet, fiber is subtracted from total carbs to give you an idea of the number of grams of carbohydrate that are actually impacting your blood glucose levels (net carbs). Without net carbs, it shows that my daily carb intake is WAY over what it should be when almost half of that is fiber.

Quite frankly, it‚Äôs underwhelming and seems like it wants to be more like MyFitnessPal or Fitbit. However, its scanning function hardly works, and a lot of the information it does have is wrong or incomplete. It also does not track vitamins and minerals, which are really important, especially if you‚Äôre dieting. You also have limited control over what information you can input for a meal or recipe. I will say that I like the faces next to individual food items, but again, this is only effective if the information attached to the food item is correct.

277,4,2019-09-18T03:09:48.000Z,musicabby,Great app and has helped so much but..,"I‚Äôve been using this app for 2 months so far and have already lost 15 pounds. It has become part of my lifestyle. The only thing that I wish would be improved would be for there to be more exercises for me to look up and log. I have been adding the approximate amount of calories burned for each exercise that I do, but it would help a lot if more exercises were added to the database. A thing that I find odd is that things like ‚Äúcleaning the house‚Äù and ‚Äúplaying drums‚Äù are exercises in the database while things like battle rope and vertical pull-ups aren‚Äôt. Love the app but this is my only advice.","Many thanks for your review and awesome job with your weight loss! We are super happy to hear that Lifesum has contributed to your success!

278,5,2021-04-08T01:59:55.000Z,Jenjendoitagain,Easy and Fun!!!,I‚Äôve had SEVERAL ‚Äúweight loss‚Äù apps and this one so far is my favorite‚Äî mainly because the free options are better than most and i don‚Äôt feel much pressure to download and pay $25 for the premium version. It gives me the option to log my water which is great because I really try to drink a gallon of water per day so it‚Äôs easy to log. The meal logging options are easy and he little apple animations are super cute! I gave it 5 stars because you can use almost every feature for free which is not the case for most apps like this. Highly recommend!,Hello Jen! Thanks a lot for leaving your feedback! We are glad to read that you are satisfied with your Lifesum experience and that you are using a lot of our features!

The emojis that judge your meal choices are cool, but when the food info isn‚Äôt correct, they‚Äôre not much help. The search database is completely off calorie-wise and most things are misspelled (even cell phones have spell check now..), so if you don‚Äôt have a barcode on what you‚Äôre eating, you‚Äôre screwed. I found myself Googling how many calories were actually in foods - most of the time, MyFitnessPal was the first search result - and adding it manually. When you add manually, you can only input calories, no other nutrition info. Also, with MyFitnessPal, you get recipes/articles without upgrading to premium.",Thank you very much for your feedback!

There‚Äôs a huge library of recipes, but they all show as ‚Äú4 Servings‚Äù with no way to change it. The meal plans don‚Äôt last more than 3 weeks, which definitely isn‚Äôt enough time to meet most people‚Äôs weight loss goals. The water tracker doesn‚Äôt let you customize the size of a bottle or glass, and the notifications don‚Äôt work at all (they're enabled in the app settings and the iOS settings). It would be great to pick recipes from the app and turn them into a shopping list, or even the ability to import recipes from the web (via the share buttons in browsers), and have the ingredients auto-import into a meal plan with a shopping list.",Thank you for your feedback!

The meal plans are thought and valuable. The photo the food works surprisingly well too. However the app is buggy, crashes a good portion of my uses and sometimes the data gets munged but quickly fixed with a restart of the app. It probably deserves 2 stars, but I am hopeful the quality will improve, features will be added and the food database is cleaned up. I‚Äôm not sure I would spend the 40-50$/annual subscription.

If users can‚Äôt use the barcode scanner, they can only enter calories without macros. It defeats the purpose of having any plan that tracks those, and makes the premium account kind of useless UNLESS you‚Äôre eating foods that are already in the database. Combing through customer discussion boards, this has been a requested feature since 2016. Clearly this customer concern hasn‚Äôt risen to the degree of import necessary to compel a design or architectural change at Lifesum in four years.

If I‚Äôve purchased something made by a keto bakery and have the macros, why can‚Äôt I add this food? The only self add I see is the simple calorie add. I was forced to purchase the app in order to use the keto strict plan, and now it‚Äôs limiting me in how I can use it. Also, i don‚Äôt always have a barcode for my food. Some eggs are naked in a bowl and have no carbs. But when I take a photo, they show up as .9 carbs. This is a big deal when you can only have 20 carbs a day. Another annoying thing: I don‚Äôt have time to enter an entire recipe for food or meal and allow the app to determine the macros. I have a good idea based on what I can read for myself. Why can‚Äôt I just input it myself when need be? It‚Äôs very limiting and frustrating to be this expensive.","Thank you for your feedback.

The only issue I‚Äôm having is that it crashes at least 5 times a day.

My recommended meal plan was to eat what I want 5 days a week, and fast 2 days a week. Are you KIDDING ME?!?!? Please someone else agree with me that this is unhealthy both physically and mentally. I mean really??? A NUTRITIONAL ADVISOR is helping me meal plan by telling me NOT TO EAT FOR TWO DAYS. Outrageous. This type of ‚Äúmeal plan‚Äù is what encourages eating disorders. I pray this portion of the app can be removed in order to spare others from the damage it may potentially cause.

It gets the workout calories right but the step calories are completely off - first of all, they double count between steps and workouts (when I go for a run, the app adds calories for the workout and then for all of the steps); second, the amount of calories per step is huuuuge.

The app itself has been a little frustrating to figure out. I don‚Äôt think you can create your own recipes. I‚Äôm doing the keto burn plan and likes the idea of not having to think about the food or plan it out. However, I‚Äôm only allowed 20 carbs a day and I just ate the breakfast on the plan without looking at the nutritional info, and it was 16.5 carbs. Looking at the rest of the day, my carbs are WAY over the limit, which will put me out of ketosis. So I‚Äôm either going to have to go hungry or get knocked out. The whole point of paying for this was so I didn‚Äôt have to figure out my amounts. I ASSUMED that the recipes they used would be within my range.","Thank you for your feedback and sorry to hear about the issue with tracking meals from our Meal Plan.

My last complaint is that I‚Äôm very underweight, so underweight that the app won‚Äôt let me enter my weight. It keeps saying ‚ÄúAre you sure that‚Äôs what you meant?

I am currently doing the keto plan and a lot of the meals have salmon, or random ingredients like halloumi or bresaola. I tried to find those last two in multiple grocery stores, but haven‚Äôt been able to. These ingredients and some others are also too expensive to eat very often. I‚Äôd prefer if I could easily swap the ingredients (like there were substitutes I could edit the recipes with rather than having to enter an entire meal into the tracker just because I changed one ingredient), or the recipes used more accessible and affordable ingredients.","Thank you so much for your valuable feedback, we will forward it to the team in charge!"

The measurements are in an odd combination of deciliter, cups, grams, and the occasional teaspoon or tablespoon, all in one recipe. The Turkey Spinach Omelette and Quinoa with Eggplant and Spinach are terrible recipes...they do not include anything in the way of spice or flavoring and are inedible as-is. Tracking plan meals is buggy - sometimes they do not show up in your calorie count and sometimes they do. The recipe for the Crispbread with Apple, Cream Cheese, and Walnuts tracks as 2298 calories and there is no way to fix the calorie count.

I‚Äôve noticed some annoying glitches with the tracking though. For instance, it seems to switch back and forth between adding back exercise calories and not. This isn‚Äôt a huge deal but it‚Äôs pretty annoying when you are 400 calories under your limit then suddenly 50 over without having eaten anything new.

The reason is when I went to start food tracking again, I wasn't able to change my macro percentages unless I switched to premium. I used to be able to change this no problem with the free one, and was so shocked I decided to switch immediately. Changing macro levels should be no different than changing your calories.

The app was recommending for me to have only 457 calories a day! And as I continue using the app it recommends I only eat 328 calories!!! Calories are energy and that‚Äôs what your body needs. To eat less than 1,000 a day is not healthy. For the app to even recommend that is not ok. While it is good to eat healthy like fruits and vegetables, carbs and protein should be included.

I have tried signing out and signing back in and even deleting the app and then re downloading. Neither of these seemed to help.

The application however extrapolates that that is the nutritional information per slice. It has done this with every single thing I have scanned. The data is the same for what is already cached in the application. Which is why I have been scanning my food, because it‚Äôs wrong. The application itself looks great.

I like that you can just add in calories if the app does not have your food items stored though I wish we could manually enter macros in ourselves also. Sometimes I have a recipe with calories, carbs, protein and fat written out but I am limited to only entering my calorie number in the app. It would be nice to be able to put in the macros myself to keep an accurate count!!",Thank you very much for your positive review!

Or looking at past days I'm unable to scroll. Syncing is also hit or miss. Overall, using this app is sort of tragic since it's so close to a seamless experience but they haven't yet taken the extra step to make it as reliable as it could be.

Additionally adjusting your cal goal is also nearly impossible, while it‚Äôs under settings, it doesn‚Äôt actually adjust no matter how many times you save so it‚Äôs hard to track how on target you are.

The only thing I don't like about this app is that the water tracking feature only allows you to track two different amounts , this makes it very hard to add in water when your water bottle / cups aren't that amount . it would be great and would really help the apps likeability if the delevopers could make it so you can add your own custom amounts to their liking !",

It would be wonderful if there was a net carbs feature for ketogenic diets. I have been under eating carbs because I assumed the app took the fiber out of the carb count but as it turns out it doesn‚Äôt. Also, I have scanned certain foods like an avocado, and my avocados get a bad rating but other avocados are okay. Is this because some foods do have their fiber subtracted out of their carbs?

It keeps me motivated and even though I struggle greatly with my relationship with food.,"It is up to you if you want to consume the calories you burn when exercising. It is most likely that you will reach your weight loss goal faster if you exclude those calories, however, faster doesn't always equal a better result in the long run. You should also make sure, if you decide to exclude your exercise calories, that you are never hungry and that you feel well. If you feel hungry, fatigued or have any other symptom of unwellness, this most likely indicates that you are not consuming enough calories. The important thing is to listen to your body!

I used to be a lot more overweight than I am now and it is because this app helped me to lose weight and also helped me get on a better diet so I really do think that every one who wants to loose weight should try this app. Also another cool thing is that if you get premium there is so many different recipes on so many yummy things to make and so I think you should try it,"Yay!

You have to go into each recipe to find out what ingredients to use. I can find the same recipes by searching keto sites and I can track my fitness through my fitness watch.

So, it keeps fluctuating and jumping back to original weight even though I‚Äôm not entering that info. I mentioned it to the ap company.

This would not be a problem if there were some way to correct it. There also doesn‚Äôt seem to be as many stored food options and restaurants as MyFitnessPal, which requires me to go to google to look up everything I eat on cheat days, which is annoying.

None of the brands are the ones I buy, many of them are fast food (I don‚Äôt do that either) and a simple homemade option is buried someplace (if even there). So, entering foods in my diary is a bit cumbersome and time consuming. Sometimes I give up on trying to find the fit and choose whatever from the list.

One of the things that appealed to me when I previewed the app was the variety of plans. The downside was that it doesn‚Äôt explain the details of each forcing me to try and research each. After signing up I found that the meals did not appeal to me. I grew up on the Pacific Rim cuisine of Hawaii and I could not see preparing and eating the recipes included. Also it‚Äôs extremely difficult to enter food consumed. The inventory is not as comprehensive as another app that I am not naming. Expensive lesson learned as I am not going to be using this for most of the 6 months that I purchased.,We are very sorry to hear that you feel that way.

Instead, It's ruined my diet streak. In the Paleo diet, I'm not allow to intake any carbs, sugars, or fruits. But the ""unhappy face"" doesn't really know what my body needs, nor does this app have any good recipes for the Paleo diet. It's a pure meat and veggie diet. How hard is this to understand?","Thank you very much for your feedback! Currently we do unfortunately not have Paleo among the offered diet plans yet. That can, of course, still change in the future. So if you haven't chosen a specific diet from the Plans section in the app you are currently on the Classic diet and the feedback you get on the tracked food is based on that.

It gives you a break down of how much you would pay each month when purchasing multiple months. This leads you to believe you paying monthly and can choose to cancel at anytime if you choose. After receiving a $30 bill, I realized that you pay the total upfront and you are not billed monthly. When I reached out to the App Store, I was told the purchase is non-refundable. Even though I am now stuck with the app for a year, I doubt I will even try it now. I am disappointed that I was lead to believe I had the flexibility of cancelling if I chose to do so.",Thank you very much fro your feedback! You are eligible for a refund within 14 days.

It‚Äôs slow to sync with my Apple Watch, and it‚Äôs impossible to add meals by their macro amounts. For example, i wanted to add a treat (soy green tea frap from Starbucks) and I can‚Äôt add it unless I submit each ingredient, rather than inputting the nutrition information from starbucks‚Äô website (title, number of carbs, protein, etc).

Really makes me angry because this is basic foods. I made a half pound Hamburger and salad and I can‚Äôt get a proper count, but a Big Mac or some obscure fast food is easily found.

However, I don‚Äôt recommend following the amount of calories it tells you to eat especially if you input how many calories you burned during your workout. The amount is way too high. As long as you know how many calories you need to eat this app is great. I chose the lose weight option and it told me I needed to be eating over 4000 calories which is way off.",

Your health score is based off the amount of plants you eat and though I hit all my micronutrients almost everyday, I‚Äôm classified as ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù. Also, the biggest issue is the premium.

What a disappointment. I can see how this would be useful for people who eat meat, though‚Äîotherwise, not many choices or options to choose from, and not as customizable as advertised.

It presets it but not to what would be accurate for what your goals are. The app isn't exceptionally user friendly all in all.

However the food ratings seem to be way off. Whenever I add a healthy food it always has a frowny face saying it is high in carbohydrates-- honestly we NEED carbs for energy and I just find it pathetic that a banana has a frowny but a frozen food high in sodium has a smiley face. I find it upsetting and I think it could lead people in the wrong direction! Is there anyway to turn off the smiley+frowny faces because fruit+veggies+legumes+etc. are NOT unhealthy :),"Thank you very much for your feedback!

899,1,2019-02-07T18:15:02.000Z,LookAtACellBioTextbook,This app recommends STARVATION,"Hi, prospective doctor here. For people attempting to lose weight, this app recommends you undergo ‚Äútwo days of fasting‚Äù or the keto diet. Both of these options cut out sugar which is necessary for glycolysis, the metabolic pathway that fuels your body and synthesizes the ATP and Pyruvate that is used for Pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. All these processes keep your body alive and functioning. Eliminating glucose long term will lead to muscle deterioration and in severe cases, keto acidosis or self-canibalisation. Both are LIFE THREATENING. I suggest seeking a nutritionist who knows the bodily processes and not a trendy app that favors body image above health.","Thank you for your concern. We believe that both 5:2 fasting and the ketogenic diet are low risk in the short term and indeed many users report success with these diets. We find the risks due to being overweight are far higher, which is why we include these diets in our recommendations. We would like more long-term research on both diets, but unfortunately these studies take time. We always attempt to offer the healthiest version of a diet that we believe is possible today. For individuals with health conditions, please consult your doctor before making large changes."

Can you send us more details at contact@lifesum.com and let us know if you detect a pattern that triggers the app to crash? Thanks in advance!

First off it‚Äôs too difficult to import your own and there is not enough variety of the recipes that I‚Äôm looking for.

And yet the diary is the main point of the app. Just take a bottle of red wine for example: 100 grams (silly claim with 95% carbohydrates !!!and a wopping 210 gr. of net carbs!!! ) I pity someone who believes this.

Also makes really bad mistakes when entering food for previous day. Automatically adds it to today every time and you have to keep deleting and correcting it. Super unreliable. Also lots of junk stats in random entries that need to be cleaned up. Very few products actually verified by Lifesum. It‚Äôs pretty.

1621,1,2018-04-27T20:01:36.000Z,Stephaanieex3,Very difficult to find food,"Even for large retailers like Trader Joe‚Äôs. I think more time should be spent making logging food easier. I find it a bit lazy to make the users in charge of the database, and as we can all see it isn‚Äôt working out. If other apps managed to do it I‚Äôm sure lifesum can too. And as I‚Äôm paying to use the app I think resources should be delegated to this.","The verified foods are from several food databases: the USDA, food items from Livsmedelsverket in Sweden, from the UK Food Standards Agency and the BLS from Germany."

Which is confusing when using apps because we assume it‚Äôs per month and then you can cancel. Now I‚Äôm stuck again with an app that I won‚Äôt use probably!  Doesn‚Äôt even provide that many options for the price. Don‚Äôt buy,"When you purchase a Premium subscription you can either choose to be charged monthly (1-month subscription) or you can pay in advance (all other subscriptions). Choosing a subscription with a runtime longer than 1 month you will get a discount, just as you get one when you are signing up with, for example, a gym membership."

2453,5,2018-04-11T14:34:05.000Z,dandelionlion,Incredible and perfect,"This app is with every penny. I purchased the annual subscription and have been using it for only about a week but so far it's been incredibly valuable. I have been entering in every meal, snack, and my water intake. Drinking water has helped me to be healthier and stay hydrated! I've been hitting my goals every single day. I love the design of the app, it's so beautiful. The designer did an amazing job at creating a very nuanced and detailed experience. It's a joy to use this app and it's fun! The illustrations and colors are fantastic. I was a MyFitnessPal user for years and since they were acquired by UA they stopped updating, improving, and evolving the app in any way. This is fitness and food tracking at a new and modern level. It's really a wonderful app. It is absolutely helping me to reshape my lifestyle. The added bonus is the integration of recipes that you can easily add to your meal tracking, not to mention the food is actually pretty good and simple to make. What more could you want? Also it's really nice to be able to choose between different types of diets, with each adjusting the calories you should be having at each meal. A feature that's really awesome is being able to see a summary of your intake for the day, which is broken down and categorized across protein, carbs, and fat, in a beautiful infographic of graphs and pie charts. I love just looking at this app!  So in that way it's quite personal, which makes the whole experience far more engaging than any other fitness app I've ever used. It's well worth the price and I will continue to use the app throughout my day to stay on track and be as healthy as possible. Keep up the amazing work Lifesum!",Thank you so much for your feedback! We very much appreciate that!

This app, is honestly the HOLY GRAIL of nutrition tracker app. AND YES I SAY NUTRITION, because it is not just a weight loss, cal counter, water tracker, it‚Äôs so much more than that. I know this because I can probably say I have used every freakin app to try and make the habit of healthy living stick. So there is a few bugs here and there but nothing I can say that would make me stop using it. Mainly just certain calories not matching up etc. but I doubt the makers of this app can control that due to it probably being inputted from other resources, BUT I will say, it‚Äôs almost 75% accurate if you‚Äôre not specifically measuring anything out. I‚Äôm saying this because I do measure everything out, and honestly if you do measure your food and put it into the app, it is extremely accurate, some of the work has to be put on your side because a phone screen cannot accurately calculate how much your eating. It is a tool!!!! An extremely useful, well made, and STUNNING tool to help you along whatever health journey you are going on. My FAVORITE function of the app of all is you can create your own recipes where it calculates the calories in what you made, let me tell you, an absolute game changer. If you have an Apple Watch, it pairs the app to your activityüòç. I lost 14 lbs and toned up (of course with exercise and such) but with this app by my side I honestly felt like it was effortless.

2554,4,2020-04-26T13:41:26.000Z,Brookliey C.,"So many great features, but can be difficult to use.","I‚Äôve actually enjoyed the many many features that are all bundled into this one app, and I don‚Äôt think any app can compare! However, I think there‚Äôs still some bugs and things that make it less easy to use. For one, sometimes you can scan the barcode of the food you ate (thinking it‚Äôll be faster and easier), but then the calories that Lifesum logs are actually different from the calories on the package with the same serving size. I‚Äôm often having to jerry-rig the serving size to make it match the package because even an extra ten calories can make the app give you a frowny-face for the meal. Secondly, maybe it‚Äôs just my account specifically, but my weight is never recorded in permanence in the weight log. Everyday that I log my weight, it starts me right back off where I weighed before I started using the app, saying ‚Äúwow you lost 5 pounds today!‚Äù when really I lost one pound and the other lost pounds were logged on previous days. In my calendar of weight statistics, it‚Äôs a stagnant, flat line from my goal weight for about a week and then will drop down as soon as I update it. Tomorrow, though, it‚Äôll pretend I never logged a change yesterday and go right back to my starting weight. Lastly, I wish that the units the servings were marked in was more clear. Often ‚Äúpieces‚Äù will actually mean the one serving size as mentioned on the package of the food, yet pieces makes you want to type in te NUMBER OF PIECES you ate. Like pizza rolls. ‚ÄúOne pieces‚Äù is actually 6 pieces and 220 calories. In spite of all this, I think the app is beautiful in design and I love how many features are available. I also think that premium might not be worth it... I‚Äôm using premium now during a free month trial, and I don‚Äôt feel like it gave me a whole lot more. I don‚Äôt feel like having this premium month gave me a taste of anything I‚Äôd consider buying after my free period is over.",Thank you for your thorough review and feedback!

2825,3,2020-10-16T22:02:25.000Z,miraiza63,Not what I expected.,"I decided to do the 3 month Lifesum. I've had enough time to determine it is not for me. (I only used 1.25 months) It doesn't scan food items correctly. I will scan in the package and the calories and protein wouldn‚Äôt be accurate to the item I just scanned per serving. I‚Äôd either get the calories right or the protein but not both. Over half the time, you have to measure your food by weight instead of doing it by cups. I have to tweak most of my stuff and you can't look up uncommon food items a little under half the time. And I haven't once used there meal plans because at least one item in the recipe we don't have in our home. It normally is an uncommon ingredient that poor people wouldn‚Äôt have in their cupboard. They don't set up planning for a weekly bases or grocery lists like I was hoping. And there recipes aren't exactly set to your style. Chose clean eating and most recipes still lacked the protein factor which is my hardest obstacle. (I can never seem to eat enough in my diet) So don't get this app unless you are only counting calories and if that is the case don't do the upgrade. Not worth it. But I'm glad I did it so I now know what it all entails. This was a good step to finding what I AM looking for. Calorie counter and meal planner combo. But even that isn‚Äôt needed if you have the Fitbit app. PS it also doesn‚Äôt hook up to MY version of the Fitbit which was disappointing. If you still decide you‚Äôre going for it and want to pay for the upgrade double check in your Fitbit app to see if you‚Äôre Fitbit is compatible. And if you DO have a Fitbit I highly suggest you just pay the premium for that.","Thank you for your valuable feedback, we appreciate it."

2925,3,2019-08-06T17:08:21.000Z,Kree8vkim,Need help/suggestions,"Hello! Thank you for what appears to be a really good app to get me on track for losing weight. However in just starting out it hasn‚Äôt been very user-friendly. For instance I wanted to input a burger, with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise, no bun. It would be helpful if, next to each item I need to track, there was an ‚Äúincrease‚Äù or ‚Äúdecrease‚Äù button. For example, currently,  to input 2 slices of bacon, I have to type the word ‚Äúbacon‚Äù in the app two separate times and add it to be tracked, where it would be much simpler and less time-consuming if you had the ability to hit an ‚Äúincrease‚Äù or ‚Äúdecrease‚Äù sign next to each food to indicate that you‚Äôre having two slices of bacon (or three or four), without having to go back and input the bacon slice two, three, or four times (If that makes sense!) Also, the ability to delete anything on the ‚Äúpre-planned menus‚Äù that the app suggests. For instance, on the ‚Äúbeef burger and lettuce leaves‚Äù dish, I do not eat onions, and I cannot eat cheese. There is nowhere for me to subtract those items from the ‚Äútrack this item‚Äù so then my calories, etc, will not be accurate. Also during the ‚Äútest questions‚Äù there is no place to put foods that I wish to specifically avoid (ie in my case, cheese and fish). I‚Äôm not vegan/vegetarian;  I do eat beef, poultry, pork... but not seafood. And I don‚Äôt care for cheese and yogurt. So it would be nicer to have the ability to input foods to avoid so that I don‚Äôt get the suggested ‚Äúsalmon‚Äù meal ever! This is just my first day of using so I may have more thoughts as I go along but these are what jumped out at me to begin with! Thanks!",Thanks for the feedback!

Lifesum has such little integration with health/fitness products that, yes, I had to enter my weight daily. My Garmin watch and scale had zero integration with Lifesum. And because of the lack of integration with standard fitness products I was unable to even track my steps or enter my step count from my Garmin watch.

Lifesum not only allows me to track my calories but it calculates macros and gives food/meal ratings. I really enjoy the food and meal ratings and the tips it gives to balance your diet. It does more than the average app. It feels more like a change for a healthy lifestyle than just a fad diet. I purchased the premium because it goes more in depth with ratings and how to better your ‚Äúscore/rating‚Äù.,Thank you for your review! Can you please send your details and issues directly at contact@lifesum.com so our support can help you further? Thank you very much in advance! We apologise for the inconvenience.
3078,3,2019-10-09T15:13:48.000Z,CxxSxx7,Okay...,"But there‚Äôs no free trial period for premium. Most apps give the option of testing out premium for a week for free which gives the user the option of purchasing a membership if they found the app to be phenomenal. I kept trying to see if there was a free trial period, but all they offered was a 30% off premium and like a dummy, I caved. Now, I‚Äôm stuck between continuing the membership for the $30 something I paid for or just dealing with the fact that I wasted $30 something dollars on an app I feel like I got stuck with because a lot of the reviews claim it‚Äôs hard to get the refund. Aside from this, the app is okay.","Thank you for your feedback. We do offer a 2 week free trial upon request.

You‚Äôll get that, but with only certain ‚Äúplans.‚Äù  I‚Äôm not vegetarian. I‚Äôm not into paleo. I surely don‚Äôt want to eat like Denise every day. You‚Äôll get enough meal options for a week.  I tried all meal tracts that came with grocery lists  (you‚Äôll get grocery lists for 4 plans, you‚Äôre on your own for the rest). I really did. For a month. The recipes provided are horrible. No taste, bland, and quite frankly, I‚Äôd rather pay $10 for bulk unsalted butter than a 4 oz container of ghee. I cooked enough for my family of four. We ended up throwing over half of every meal in the trash. The dogs would not even eat it. Money wasted because the recipes tasted like trash.  What chefs approve of these recipes? Please let me know because I‚Äôll keep an eye out for their names and avoid them. I‚Äôm open minded about different styles and food preps, but this is just bad. I 100% wasted money on this app and on the grocery store trips. The turkey on rye sandwich was the best offering of the bunch and even that‚Äôs a stretch. Yeah, I lost weight, but it was because the recipes were unappetizing, tasteless, and with the money wasted on groceries, I did not want to eat. If you are really and truly looking for help with weight loss and meal prep, please look elsewhere. This app could be great, but it‚Äôs not. So much potential, just not there yet",Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on our app and sorry to hear that you were not satisfied.

We offer variety of meal plans where the set ratio of macro nutrients differ.

We will suggest a recommended ratio for the specific diet chosen, but it is adjustable - so if you would prefer to eat a low fat diet, you can lower the fat and raise the carbs and/or protein."

3109,1,2020-01-14T23:16:10.000Z,CCW223,Misleading,"My family and I do a Paleo/Whole Foods lifestyle which means we eat very clean with sugars that are non-processed like honey, maple syrup, and dates in limited amounts. I found this app very misleading because certain carbs are rated unhealthy but it then tells you your carb count is low and to eat more???? Which is essentially what the paleo diet is: low carb and higher protein with healthy fat choices. As an example Cassava flour is 100% carbs so it is rated as üòê but your total daily intake of calories will tell you to eat more? If your rating certain carb foods as üòê but pushing increased carb content how in the world is someone supposed to eat carbs unless it is essentially fruit based. I will state white potatoes are rated 88% carbs but are also a great nutrient source which is misleading again. So I do realize the app is pushing a healthier choice of carb but when food is mixed in the right proportions cassava can be a healthy choice so again??? Secondly, cashews and other nuts are not a healthy choice if they are in flour form but again in the right proportions they can be. Third, Ghee, avocado, and olive oil are not considered healthy choices either. Lastly, you can eat meat sources on the app (red meat) which drastically increases your fat intake for the day which is rated as a great source of nutrients and minerals. The concept is a good idea but very misleading and costly if you pay for the in app purchases which I will not do. I will be going back to my FatSecret because there is no ‚Äúfood shaming‚Äù going on in that app. By the way if your going to rate foods based on ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù maybe developers should consider a system that rates the use of pesticide and herbicide exposure along with nutrient depleted farmlands that have even vegetables highly unhealthy!","Thank you for your review.

Also, it would incorrectly tally up negative net carbs.  There were several times I ended up with more net carbs left to eat than I started with, all because the app calculated a food and gave it a negative net carb total.

They thought alot about what operations will take the most time and tried to make them easier. You can create custom foods, then create meals (sets of food items) and add them to the directory. The dirctory is well organized with features like searching and marking favorites. People complain about the food database, but these things take time to develop and it sounds like they will be user submitable, so they will be handled by the community. Also the nutritional information varies a lot between different brands, so you are going to have to end up entering in a lot of custom foods anyway, I don't see this as a problem or an issue that iShape could possibly solve aside from doing what they have already done and make an expandable database.",

It has made me exponentially more aware of what I am eating and how much I snack throughout the day. By tracking what I eat carefully, I have been able to make smarter food choices and I snack mindlessly far less than I used to. I also love the water, fruit, and vegetable trackers because I have also been consciously drinking more water and making a point to eat more vegetables. The app is beautifully designed and very user friendly, and I enjoy it so much that I paid for the full subscription. I use this app more than I use social media. I appreciate that the app helps making healthy choices fun and simple, and I would highly recommend it regardless of whether you are trying to lose weight or not.",

I'm not trying to lose much weight.. just working to get into better shape and improve my overall health. I really like using Lifesum so far. It integrates nicely with the Apple Watch, and my suggested intake changes based on my activity throughout the day. I love that you can add your own recipes and save meals! These features, along with the ability to save favorite foods will eventually save me lots of time logging food going forward. I also find that I save time by planning my meals in advance vs. logging each meal throughout the day. I haven't tried any of their recipes yet, but it looks like they have some good ones! Suggestions for improvement: This might be too complicated, but I'd love to see some integration with Allrecipes / the ability to quickly add favorite recipes from this site. I would also like to see more nutritional data (vitamins and minerals). I feel like most of their plans are a little crazy with the suggested daily protein intake (it's usually very high). All in all, though, the only thing that's really disappointed me is that I recommended this app to my mother and after a few days it wouldn't let her use it anymore unless she upgraded to a premium membership. I was under the impression that you could still use basic features without upgrading.",
3166,3,2017-08-01T00:57:13.000Z,semperes,Love a lot of aspects but definitely still needs to grow!,"As soon as I downloaded this, I loved how easy it was to use and how the interface was so visually pleasing and quick to get the hang of. I also loved how I could track my water intake as well as my exercise of the day. But as the days went by, some issues popped up that I really wanted to address in a review. Firstly is the accuracy of the food you can track. There have been more than a few times that the nutrition label read differently than what Lifesum had listed and because of that, I find this app not all that trustworthy on the nutrients I'm getting day to day and that's disappointing. I would also add that I wish the database had a more rigid system, it's a little weird to see more than one listing for a banana and not knowing which one would be the most accurate. Secondly I wish the targeted calories could be adjusted by the user if they so choose. I don't exactly want to follow what this app suggests when it comes to how much I should be eating for weight loss, I definitely think it overestimates. Lastly I wish there was an easier way to track meals you ate days before or ate for dinner one day and ate it for lunch the next. I will still continue to use this app but I hope in the future to see some changes!",Thank you very much for your feedback!

3171,5,2015-02-12T18:28:22.000Z,pgscg,"So easy to track calories, protein, fat!","I used to do this in a spreadsheet. After adding foods I eat frequently that were not already in the huge database, I can easily set up my day and make changes if my schedule, dining out, grocery shopping changes. It's so clear I need to add exercise, as I know my precise intake and don't want to eat less. Things I would like added: ability to add a food to My Things when after scanning, finding it barcode was already in the database and verifying the food had been correctly entered, instead of only having the ability to add it to my diary. I had searched for it before I tried to manually add it, but it didn't show up. If it's in My Things, it will show up quickly at the top. I would also like to see a schedule of my nutrition, exercise and weight progress in addition to the progress bar that shows my starting, current and goal weight.",
3172,1,2015-11-17T00:32:34.000Z,arual9109,Disappointed,"This app has great potential but after using it for less than 24 hours (yes, that's all it took), I must admit that it is a letdown. I entered my personal information, updated my goals, connected to my Fitbit, logged my food and exercise... Only to find out that the information I was inputting was not saved accurately. Regardless of how many times I changed it, my birthdate and starting weight kept reverting back to an incorrect amount (that wasn't entered by me at anytime). This led me to doubt about the application saving the other information I was entering such as calories or workouts. When I spoke to a representative, I was told this issue would be fixed in about 3 weeks. That is ridiculous! Don't launch your app until it's ready to be used. Especially one that customers pay for! Another complaint is the meal logging. It is very difficult to determine meals based on ounces or grams. There are few foods that I found that were listed by serving size or quantity. Lifesum's selection of meals is not very expansive and most days, I found myself looking up the meals with another application to ensure I was accurately logging them. NOT WORTH THE TIME.",
3173,5,2016-01-29T05:46:39.000Z,Jstew88lifesumfan,Fan of Lifesum it's helped me a lot,"So Lifesum has seriously helped me. I haven't had any glitches with my app and don't struggle with added food to my food diary tracker. It's really easy and simple to follow, it does the math for you, to figure out how many calories your eating, how many grams of carbs, protein, and fat your consuming and how many you have left to consume. I've done the ketone diet before I got Lifesum... I only lost 2 pounds a month and was completely confused why I wasn't losing more! I got the Lifesum app and it showed me (by tracking everything I ate) that I wasn't eating the right balance of carbs, protein and fat for the ketone diet. I was floored when I found out certain brands of food that I thought were healthy was totally ruining my diet. I lost about 10 pounds within less than 6 weeks solely by using this app. I can scan in barcodes of food items I get and see how much of it I can eat. It's great, Lifesum rates it for me too to see if it's a good fit for my diet. I'm gonna keep and use this app for a while. And they have awesome recipes too.",
3174,4,2017-02-09T12:48:42.000Z,D. Hill,Lifesum,"Lifesum to me is an application that represents the potential of how our mobile devices can assist in us reaching the best physical version of ourselves. While my initial review is only based on the free version, I believe I can note how beneficial this application is. The application begins by asking about your age, gender, height and weight. Lifesum incorporates a beautiful colorful yet simple to navigate design. The bottom menu tabs are where users can bounce from category to category whether it be diet, nutritional facts or another section. The app makes it easy to input your diet with a comprehensive database that caters to any meal of the day as well as water cup diagrams that fill up and mark your progress with a simple tap on the image. Users can read daily nutritional facts and articles to better determine what is best for you. The premium version allows you to receive specialized recipes. I feel I have only touched a tip of the iceberg when it comes to the effect Lifesum can have on my life and many others.",
3175,3,2017-02-12T19:38:38.000Z,Henryjperc,Lots of potential but improvement needed,"I recently upgraded to the premium version after using the free version for about a week. I was very happy with the free version but found that the premium version has left me slightly less satisfied. One reason for this is the fact that you must constantly answer the 41 Life Score questions to get an updated score. To me, this is an annoying process and I wish it would update automatically from the foods I've recorded in my diary. Secondly, I also wish the fruit and vegetable trackers would update based off the food that I've recorded in the diary. It seems redundant to have to press an extra button to record this information. Finally, I was under the impression that the premium version would provide some sort of ""eat this, not that"" feature for the foods it deems unhealthy. I haven't seen this feature and I think it would be great. In the end, I really like this app but I don't feel like I'm getting a the best value for the premium version. I truly believe that it can get there with some updates and adjustments but for now I remain slightly unsatisfied. The app seems pretty new so I am more than happy to stick with it with hopes that it makes adjustments in the future.",
3176,4,2017-02-14T03:39:39.000Z,Lo-sim,Near perfect,"This is my favorite app for tracking calories. It blows My Fitness Pal out of the water in terms of its ability to teach you how to eat right for your fitness goals and how to generally lead a healthy lifestyle. The only flaw is that it has crowd sourced some of its nutrient data from users, which means there is some noticeable human error as you start searching for foods and looking at calorie counts and serving sizes. As long as you are being conscious about your foods and understand the basics when it comes to measurements and serving sizes, you'll avoid improperly tracking your meals. As with anything in life -- it's on you to think critically even when you want an app to take care of the bulk of the work. Trust that Lifesum does a lot for the small fee you pay to unlock those features. It's incredibly well designed. They thought deeply about UX and how to drive reengagement and motivate the user to make good choices. Well done Lifesum!",
3177,1,2017-02-18T16:34:27.000Z,Whirlygirl13,Hugely disappointing,"No room to customize, not even with the upgrade (based on the description of added features). We prepare a large number of ingredients and dishes from scratch, so logging food in Lifesum is not accurate, as we're restricted to what's in the database. Also, the inability to see what's in the upgrade, specifically diet plans is frustrating. The default plan limits users to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack, all of which are calorie restricted. So for users who consume 5-6 small meals/snacks a day, this isn't helpful. If I log meals as meals, then I'm WAY under my calorie allowance as dictated by Lifesum, and some of my snacks don't get logged. If I log all of my snacks under the single ""snack"" tab, my meals are way under and my snacks are way over, according to Lifesum. There also isn't a way to log times food is consumed. Lifesum is probably alright for someone interested in very basic nutritional record keeping, but for someone needing to log for medical or serious health/fitness tracking, Lifesum has completely missed the mark. And to charge ridiculous monthly fees for a product that is mediocre at best is just ludicrous. Save your time, money, and frustration and use another method.",

It works very similarly. I love that I can log a photo of my meal along with the data. I like the smiley faces I get for healthy choices.

It is very easy to navigate and I like getting the little smiley face by my meal when I made good choices. I have many reasons why I need to keep track of what I eat, mainly because my skin tends to react to what I eat and I have been recently cutting out dairy for health reasons. That being said, since this is a overall ""healthy lifestyle"" app, I would LOVE to see more options for tracking, such as dairy-free diets, as well as maybe incorporating other lifestyle habits such as hours of sleep (it plays a big part in our lifestyle!) I would also loooove to see a way to track specific symptoms or reactions so a clear connection can be made between our food and how it affects us, such as how well your skin is doing (breakouts specifically), energy levels, cravings and how to target them, ability to focus, and things of that sort. Overall the app is great so far and I'm looking forward to seeing it's growth!!",Thanks for the feedback! Please feel free to leave suggestions for improvement here: https://lifesum.uservoice.com

I actually like the fact that the entire database of food is not on here, there is a bit of a setup getting the foods you eat entered but once it's in it's easy and you don't have 50,000 others to go through to find the one you want. Having the database online didn't make a lot of sense to me at first but after using the app it was a well thought out way to go. A simple points calculator would be helpful so I don't have to leave the app to get to my other calculator and I'd like to see a notification icon telling me how many points/calories I have left for the day but these are extras that would be nice but are not necessary.

I anticipated that the Gold version would be even that much better. It is NOT!   Adding food and snacks to this app is a nightmare. User-friendly it is not. I even tried to edit ""My Food"" on my computer by logging into the program via the internet.  It was no more helpful. In fact, it was a little bit more frustrating doing it that way. I do like how it imports my data from my Jawbone Up app &  how it relays information to the Jawbone app. It is very frustrating that there is no quick way to add food. I noticed that even when I scan the food items, the information uploaded to the app is incorrect.

The positive part of the app is that it integrates the Apple Watch and the tracking feature works well. I could have gotten that from the free version however. The paid version gives you a few recipes and a bit more nutritional information about your food.

Also does a great job keeping me honest on the weekends. Every improvement I can think of such as coordinating with say Subway to put all their data in is probably beyond the price.

Then on Saturday it'll say that my Friday calories went way over the limit - I was actually supposed to only eat 1000! There are a lot more bugs, like not registering changes I make to my personal details, not syncing properly with the web site, and this one really small but irritating thing it'll do in the search, wherein I'll type a search query and then try to go back to change it, it'll delete the whole query automatically and force me to type it again. Pretty sure that's what the ""x"" on the right side of the search bar is for. Anyway, until the MYRIAD bugs get fixed, it's more irritating to use than anything.",

Then, when I go to scan barcode, or search for the food, the food item does not show up on the list!!! 2) after successful food entry, I go to the webpage and the numbers dont match up?? For example, I go and add some Russell Stover‚Äôs sugar free candies, and instead of the calories reading 210 for 3 pieces, the total shows 99 calories/3 pieces, and all my macros show as decimals?? I added several foods and NONE of the values on the website was right.",

They want you to eat healthily, not less, because they give you how many carbs, and how much fat and protein you've had that day. They have it automatically set to a certain amount, but if you don't feel that's how many carbs you should be eating, or how many cups of water you should drink, you can change that! There's even help for gaining weight. I don't like the grading system, but I can ignore that. This app isn't magic, you have to have discipline and patience to enter everything you eat, but it works. Dropped 5 pounds the first week. After I stopped needing to lose weight, I kept it around just to help me eat healthier. This app is üëå",

The last step is for me to send Lifesum a bunch of screen shots of the app not syncing? Huh? What, you don't believe me? The burden is on me to prove to you that your app doesn't work?

Anyway, this app has been amazing for me, I took the test to see what diet would fit my needs and found that Keto-light was a fit. After reading up on it, I decided to give it a go. It grades my meals and tells me what to do to improve my food choices, helps me find recipes and able to save my own, I have been using the app for a little over 2 months and have lost 15lbs.

I really love how it has the scanner and adjusts you calorie amount for the day based on what you eat. I really like the tips that describe the effects and stages of what diet your on each day. I was so excite when I saw it tested me to see which diet is good for me based on my wants and needs. I gave four stars because the scanner is a bit wonky and they need to expand the food from groceries stores like publix, Whole Foods and popular restaurants. The scanner usually is okay but sometimes it refuses to recognize basic food like a potato.

The interface has a great aesthetic and the overall brand has a high-end feel to it vs my FitPal.  After playing with the free version I opted to pay for the full version to get a more personalized plan and recipes.  That where my disappointment came.  While I loved the questions to find a right plan for you.  The recipes are very intricate and not family friendly if you have small kids.  Not only that, but there are only a handful of recipes to pick from.  Add the fact I don't eat pork, and the list is cut even smaller. It does seem there's a bit of a rotation to a few.  And at least half look delicious.  If you're a foodie looking to get healthy.  Or don't have the constraints of super busy evenings and early bedtimes, this may be a good app for you.

I think this app should allow you to either choose the amount of calories you plan on eating or how long you want it to take for you to get to your goal weight.  This would  be cool because if you chose how many calories you plan on eating each day, Ishape would tell you how long it will take you to to get to the goal weight.  Also, if you choose how long you want it to take you, it could tell you how many calories to eat.  What if I don't want to lose 2 pounds per week?

I'd pay if I could search a food library like in MyFitnessPal, especially since you guys have cool things like choosing your own diet, in a pleasing-to-look-at app. HOWEVER, having to pay to sync my Fitbit (which I already paid money for) is beyond ridiculous when (you guessed it) MyFitnessPal does syncing for free.

Apparently, I am supposed to be consuming -238 calories for snack... How am I supposed to do that? Plus, research has shown that snacking throughout the day (with healthy foods) is good for you! Also, the measurements are weird and I wasn't the only one to notice that (I saw another complaint above). I wish there was a way to turn off criticisms and just count calories! I'm not by any means overweight and the app seems to be telling me to become skin and bones because of how it rates my portions!

The one problem is that the goals they want you to reach are virtually impossible. I eat very well, what I would consider to be average-healthy. This app basically tells me to eat raw protein powder for every meal. If I input that I ate whole grain toast with Nutella and strawberries (pretty healthy I would say) it gives me a frowny face because I was supposed to eat 30g of protein. The amount of some of the nutrients it expects you to eat are actually unhealthy. The recipes they give you are not easy. They involve buying very specific health related ingredients only found at some stores. The only reason I use this app now is for tracking how much water I drink. I think you guys should really re-evaluate what is considered healthy and what is considered excessive. Make the goals more reachable for an average human.",Thanks for the feedback!

CONS:  It only saves 7 days (bad!!) and there is no way to email/save the data.  I work with a personal trainer and I don't have anyway to give him a copy of my log and it's hard for me to look back to see my progression week over week and analyze.  Please FIX!

The one good thing about this is the food database it has; it's very extensive. However, in terms of workouts it lacks - A LOT. Some of the most frustrating things are the way it logs workouts. You can ONLY use time and not sets, reps, weight - the main things I was wanting to use this for and figured that it would be there considering they do have workouts you can select from. It is only helpful if you are doing cardio. Other than that I would strongly recommend you pass and get the free app ""Lose It!"" which does the same thing but its FREE.",

Well, I am back on and it's great to be able to have a fresh start with this app. Food library is great. I did notice with this latest version when you add a food it won't let you scroll all the way down to enter sodium and fiber. Also, the custom minutes on exercise is not working quite right.

I switched from MFP after they added the gaudy Under Armour logo to the app icon. The design and functionality is great and it's very easy to add food and recipes. The one problem I have is that when making food, you're locked in when you try to add the serving size. For example, I added peanut butter whose serving size is 2 tablespoons. I could select different units like cups or teaspoons but it would only let me have the serving as one unit like ""1 tablespoon"" or ""1 cup."" This isn't a huge deal for this, I just cut the nutrition in half but there are plenty of times where this becomes inconvenient like when the serving is ""11 crackers"" or ""6 ounces.""",

It could use a lot of upgrading though. More diet plans would be nice, such as vegan and paleo as options instead of the standard, ketogenic, and 5:2. It also needs a A LOT more food tracking options. I can barely find some of the foods when I eat out if they're on there at all, or even basic foods that I eat at home. Also the suggested recipes could be a little easier for us cooking challenged folks. I don't have easy access to obscure ingredients and it's hard to tell how to substitute them for the recipes I really want to make. Most of them are labeled as ""medium difficulty"" but I wouldn't be able to make them if I have a culinary degree. Very great potential for this app, if only it was about 3 years more mature.",

It's great that we can see brands, but it's really hard to input things that are not logged as brand items. For example, today I had a bacon egg and cheese breakfast Sandwich on an English muffin. I typed that in and no results would come up. I searched just ""breakfast sandwich"" and it was mostly all Starbucks entries or other random things but not any homemade or prepared food items to select. I ended up just logging each piece of this food separately, which I find myself doing pretty often.",

I did it for about 3 days, was super happy with it, then quit doing it because it took a lot of effort for a busy person like me, then started again a few days ago. It has helped me a lot overall. Another issue I have with it is that it has so many plans and recipes, but only premium members can use most of them. I have to pay for the food that it tells me I should eat to be healthier or reach my daily goal, and paying for premium is too much for me.

3233,3,2016-03-29T03:11:37.000Z,aventyr,"Beautiful, useful, yet frustrating","I love the design and the idea behind the app but it falls a bit short. I found that if I search a meal or food item to add, there aren't a lot of choices and most often I can't find what I'm looking for. This being the case, I can't add this to my daily meals, thus negating the usefulness of this app. I am also very disappointed in the rating system in that I could have multiple A items but it equals out to a D or E because of the total calories. I feel like the rating should be based on healthy choices and not the number of calories, seeing as I could eat nothing but raw vegetables and still get a low grade. I think this whole system needs re-thought and is sadly becoming another app that wasn't very well executed.",

Deleted the others. And lost 20 pounds so far. They make it easy to make intelligent food choices, even when eating out with friends, by putting all the data about your options right in front of you! And the recipes have been the real time saver. They really understand the different diets and push recipes to you that fit your diet, unlike the other apps that are totally calorie-centric (and completely untrustworthy for carb-sensitive people). A few more tweaks and they'll be the perfect app, but it's already a 5-star app.",

It focuses on doing deferent diet types, gives a relatively small list of recipes that work with said diets, and allows a certain amount of customizability. But there are some functionality that seems clunky and slow, which makes this app more of an obstruction, than help. They have a custom meal feature, but it's not convenient. I'm not going to take the time to input all the products that aren't in the database, and the ones close to what I have seen strangely too healthy. It would be great to have more features that build custom meals in a less round-about way and an expanded database. Having a feature that recognizes nutrition fact stickers would be amazing.

I've been trying for the past day to be able to get it open again but it won't. So it's awesome until it quit working. You put in your height, weight, age, your goal weight and it'll estimate how much weight you should lose over a certain period of time. It also keeps track of what you eat by entering in the name or scan the barcode and just hit The button and it'll calculate all the calories you had for that meal. It'll tell you if you've had too many or too little calories for that day and it will also keep track of how much water you drink by just tapping on a little picture of a glass.",

I'm not too hot on the fact that it only shows active calories on the main screen next to consumed calories. It would be nice to have all calories (resting plus active) so I can quickly see where I'm at calories in/out instead of having to look up my resting and do the math myself. The biggest problem though, and this is a more redent one, which has caused me to cancel my subscription is the glitch that resets a lot of my food entries. I enter my dinner and the app says 1 serving = 300 cal then I go back to check it later and it says 1 serving = 1 cal. So I constantly have to reenter food in creative ways in order for the calories to be correct (ie 300 servings/300 cal). That's if I can remember what the nutrition facts were on the frozen dinner I had a few hours ago.",

Highly recommend using with a Fitbit or similar unit though, because you are constantly burning calories, not just when you're exercising. My favorite part of the app is the database of foods and the bar scanner tool. It's good for keeping track of caloric consumption and how much fluid you drink. But it changes the calorie limit depending on how much you exercise which can be misleading or confusing. I like that you can add unlisted foods. I also like that you can add your own exercise activity and calories burned, but you can't put how many minutes spent on that exercise. (It always just says 1 minute).",

You have only one thigh machine, even though there are at least 8 that I know of. I'm sure they all burn different amounts of calories. Bicycle kicks not on the app; no planking, amazing exercise & still not on your app! Lying leg lifts? No. Flutter kicks? No. Leg raises? No. Russian twist? No. Plank kick throughs? No. Plank knee to elbow? No. It's really concerning the amount of exercises not on your app. CHEST PRESS!? How can you not have something so fundamental?

For the past 8 days my Fitbit wouldn't sync because of a server error. I emailed them about it and they replied back almost immediately saying that they're working on it already.

The database is pretty big and im not worried about being 100% accurate with my calories so i just put in approximates. Id really like a tutorial on like, what an ounce of food looks like, or like how much is an average glass, idk but i dont know that stuff. But it wasn't that hard to look it up.

The team continuously makes the app better every month and actually listens to user feedback on what could be improved on. It's super easy to log what I eat during the week and be able to balance it out with my workouts. Some of my favorite features include a useful(though somewhat limited) recipe book and the seamless integration with Apple Health Kit and other smart health products(such as my withings scale). This app is extremely easy to use and I encourage anyone who needs help getting fit to definitely try it out! Thanks Lifesum Team!,

The only complaint I do have is sometimes the specific items listed do not have accurate nutritional information (Ex. A certain brand of something says 1 cup has X amount of calories, but it actually has Y amount of calories per cup). And fixing the inaccurate information is a process because you have to report it and it has to be approved before it is changed. Highly recommend this app, though.

There are options for everyone, whether you ARE trying to lose weight, maintain your weight but eat healthier, or even gain weight (muscle mass). Also, there are so many options for different foods you can put in to your log, including brand names so you know that the macro count is accurate. I recommend this app to anyone who wishes to track their eating habits! Remember, workouts won't get you anywhere without the proper meal plan!",

Lifesum is simple, easy to navigate, and has just enough on it to tell you what you need without clouding up the dashboard with things you don't want. It has nearly every exercise already on it (though I found when I input my climbing the calorie burned count seems high).  This app is amazing!

Biggest issue because it's crucial to what the app is for: Because portion sizes are really confusing to set when you add a food, calorie values are just all over the place. If I hadn't been tracking calories so long I would have no clue how many calories is actually in anything. Finally, navigating is a bit tedious, even when entering food.

They make it so quick and easy to keep track; there is even a barcode scanner for expedited food entry.  Props!

The catch is though, that in order to unlock all of the recipes, I had to upgrade to the gold version. BIG mistake! Logging anything is difficult. It's nearly impossible to get accurate food portions or even exercises for that matter.  There's some type of arbitrary grading system that makes no sense whatsoever. On top of that, I haven't gotten any new recipes! I can't believe I bought a year-long subscription to be told how to put avocado on toast everyday.  The most disappointing part is once I paid for my subscription, I'm stuck with it for the full term. There's no way to cancel it until it's over. Save your money!",

It also offers the option to help with eating healthier and getting leaner.  The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the fact you have to pay a fee to be able to get the full use out of the app. Overall it could use a few minor changes but I really do love this app. Highly recommend.",Thanks a lot for your rating and feedback!

Especially once you realize what you've been cramming into your face hole.

It reminds me to stay hydrated as well. You can also track your exercises and it will change your macros based on exercise. The only problem is that it doesn't have all the exercises you would do in the gym, but I usually assume all chest workouts under the ""push-ups"" category.

Also LOVE that they give you an option to be on meal plans and rank your day based on the plan. For example, I eat low carb so I'm on their Keto diet program that way it tells me when I've eaten too many carbs. Most apps will only tell you the standard American diet recommendations, but this one has multiple options! Highly recommend!",

My only complaint is that the inventory of food they have is quite poor. I've noticed that entries done by real users are not accurate and then get circulated around. Example: There is a sweet potato entry that at 0 grams is over 2000 calories! Clearly incorrect... with that being said this app is great and I use everyday!

It will not allow me to input food for the next day, as it puts that food on the current day. It's so frustrating. Also, recently it is not correctly searching for food products that it has brought up in the past. I am very disappointed. With each bug fix, these problems get worse. In fact, ever since I started paying for it, I have had more issues than before paying. I will continue to use it since I paid for 3 months, but at this time I absolutely cannot recommend it.

You can usually fudge it by putting the components of what you ate into the log separately.  Just takes a little more time. However, I will say that the ability to track what you are eating really helps.  That extra piece of cake, nope, gonna push me over the limit.  I think that the new update and the ability to add foods will add to the utility of the program.   It might sound fussy, but no olive oil, really...

Not only does it let you keep a calendar that tracks points and daily percentages for you (with some effort), it also allows you to search an online database and save submissions as favorites.  Then, you just need to add that favorite to your daily food list.  I also like the weight tracker with added charts to see how you have progressed.  It even lets you add exercise points, though adding the info yourself is sometimes necessary.  I have found that this app works great alongside the free iPoints app, which allows you to calculate points based on calories, fat and fiber.  Definately worth the money if you are serious about losing weight.",

Then, the next day when my phone only recorded 2000 steps, the app said I burned 500. 2. I have been trying to record my daily weights, but instead of adding it into the chart as a new weight, it changes the starting weight. 3. The faces seem to have no correlation to the food I eat.

Apparently i ate nothing yesterday  and what a actually ate yesterday it says i ate the day before. And it has doubled everything i have eaten. It's all on there twice so it messed up my averages and my goal date. And so i deleted it and redownloaded it hoping it would fix it but then it pushed everything back another day.

However, I think there could be some improvement with tracking food. I think you should be able to quick add calories and carbs and protein so that if you go out to lunch and look up the nutrition, and they don't have it on the app, you can still track it. Also, the exercises could use some improvement. I like to track everything with my workout, like how many lunges I do and with what weight. That exercise is not on here, and it doesn't give me an option to create my own like My Fitness Pal does.",

It's improved so much since its last update. My only concern is the lack in the food library. I've been using other resources to create my own foods and it doesn't have enough diversity in cuisine. Also, the built in step tracker is very inaccurate, which doesn't bother me as much because I have my own pedometer.

I looked at updating my diet plan, and when I found what was most like my original plan, now it is rating nearly every day as an ""A"" when there is no way that the lasagna I ate a few days ago should be an ""A"" meal on an LCHF plan!? Plus many meals or food options are reading ""(null)"" next to them when before it would read how carbs. Also, I miss my meals telling me my carb goal rather than a calorie goal for the diet I'm on... My subscription is up soon, so I may cancel of this what I am left with.",

You set a goal, tells you how healthy the food you add is, and tracks your calories intake but gets annoying if you eat the same thing everyday and have to search for the same food. It would be helpful if they add a ""favorite"" list or an easier way to add the food you eat on a daily basis. Overall it's worth it if you have a little time to add your diet and info.

It syncs to the health app which will keep your weight and steps.  You can add exercise and activities which allows your to see what calories you have burned through the day.  The scanning tool is great for home as you prepare meals.  I would highly recommend this app for anyone looking for a easy and simple to use for beginning to get healthier!,

It appears that the Health app is syncing days from my Apple Watch and iPhone. There has to be a way to only count my Apple Watch the way MyFitnessPal does. I purchased the premium version of this app in October because I love having food plans. However ever since the update I'm frustrated that Lifesum is over-counting my calories and making it hard for me to leverage the great things about the app and making me do double the work by figuring out which exercise values I should be using. I would like to see a fix soon because I really do love this app when it works well.,

Also helps you see how big potions should be. I love how it helps me keep track of my meals and what areas need improvement. One downside is that once you add your exercise it recalculates your goal for the day and that throws me off so now i do not add exercise and that helps me stay on track.

No other app comes close to what they have done. The point of a food diary is to want to use it to become more aware of what your eating. Lifesum has accomplished this for users.

Was already on the fence since so much of the data and motivation is focused on losing weight, no matter how I set it up. I don't want to lose weight, I'm working more towards a holistic process for pain management, taking into count WHAT I eat and how it can relate to pain/inflammation. It also seems to only share some data with the iPhone Health app. May try again with an updated version, but will keep looking for the right app.","Thanks for your review!

To lose one pound a week, calculate your BMR (basal metabolic rate) and input your desired cals per day. Easy-peasy. Weight Watchers? Never tried, never will. Don't need it.

The setup is great as well. The major downfall is the discrepancy in the food stats. For example, this morning I logged a fiber bar and the app says it was 120 calories when the box says it is 140. This can make a big difference in your results when it happens on a regular basis. Hopefully they will work it out so that the app is accurate because the app is really well done otherwise.",

One concern is that the calories burned from steps (synced from Health) vary wildly from day to day. One day may be 2000 steps and 888 calories burned while another will be 6000 steps and 31 calories burned. It is inconsistent and inaccurate. This should be addressed. I will echo others concerns with inability to add foods and exercises. You must rely on logged activities with questionable calories burned, or food with fishy nutritional info.

Some days it's smooth and easy to record meals, other days it sticks and crashes, bringing my iPhone 7 Plus to a screeching halt. When it works, this app is the best meal+exercise tracker and an essential part of my day. When it doesn't, it's a constant thorn in my side. There's something really good here, but it's gets covered over too much",The fix has just been launched. Please update your app and check if you are still experiencing any issues. Thank you very much!

What might be useful would be some type of nutrient tracker as well (vitamins, minerals). I am a vegetarian and it's difficult for me to recognize which nutrients i'm lacking. But this is a weight loss tracker after all, so it's not entirely necessary, I guess.",
3391,5,2013-02-06T15:40:50.000Z,Happylai,Great Calorie Counter App,I love this app the most because you submit your target weight and it gives you a set calorie limit and how many wks it could take if u stick with your calorie intake. The only thing I would change is maybe having to pay for full access but the limited works fine for me. I have been using this app for 11wks and have lost 27lbs so far so I highly recommend this app.,

If I go back to the app or close and reopen the app the same thing happens. I can't do anything on it now because it's so buggy, but when it's not, it's a great app.",
3396,5,2016-12-05T03:30:13.000Z,Babvkitten,Love it!!,I recommend this to all my friends looking to eat more healthily! It's so great at getting you to alter what you eat to be better for your body with the way it grades you. The key to benefiting from the app is logging what you're going to eat before you eat so you have time to rethink your choices if they generate a low grade. Overall I find the app much more health oriented than other similar apps.,

You can look at you statistics and even plan meals for the future.  Its not just a diet app.  You can also keep track of your exercise, too.

I guess that just means free members just can't make mistakes, then (which is stupid; if I'm trying to track my kcal intake and exercise amount I'd expect to at least be able to change errors as a just in case, not be forced to pay for an account to do so... or maybe this site gives so little features that they have to lock out editing as an incentive to gain more customers; either way they lost this user)",
3402,2,2015-06-20T17:09:50.000Z,Abit-ti-tar,Awful for tracking carbs,A lot of the carb counts are wrong. This is a very big deal if counting carbs. So with those wrong I question everything and have to look at other sources so I end up not using the app for that. It also has lots of names brand and restaurant food. Which makes looking up just basic raw food you cook or prepare at home a chore. If you already do not eat processed foods and rarely eat out this app becomes tiresome. On a good note they said they would refund my gold account since I contacted them right away and the one good thing I like is drunk water reminders.,

Also when you add an item, it also puts half the info you put in behind the paywall too. You can't even view nutrition info that YOU PUT IN. Also when I scan a barcode, app says it's not in the db but after I spend time entering all the info, it says it already exists! So frustrating! Two stars for app and UI design only. Functionality usefulness is next to nothing.",
3404,5,2016-05-05T20:04:38.000Z,Zesty wings,Great app that could be more!,Really love the app! It really gives a visual way of tracking calories and your diet rather than having to just put numbers. I was maybe thinking of adding a budgeting part of the app because we all know how costly it can be to eat healthy. So adding maybe a price range or just by putting how much each meal cost could be a benefit to healthy living and saving money.,

I like how it encourages me with little reminders throughout the day to drink more water and if you haven't been very active.  I so far have lost about 20 # in about a month,
3406,1,2016-08-16T13:11:34.000Z,AbraxasTrevor,Do not pay for this app.,"Not worth the money at all. The # of recipes is laughable and you're better off just using Yummly. The meal and day rating system is generic (not tailored to the plan you're on as is implied during the sales pitch, very vague and not helpful). The scan barcode feature to register food items almost never has the food items in the system and in the rare event it does the nutritional facts are always wrong. I have to spend a ridiculous amount of time manually inputting the nutritional facts for each ingredient I use. Basically, you are paying to build up the database for them. Very unhappy customer.",

Only downside is that if you want to keep it free, you have to deal with TONS of ads telling you to get the paid app not only in the app but through emails as well. It would be much smoother without the ads but I'm not paying monthly just for those to go away.",

Overall, it's great. However, I wish there were more opportunities for customization without having to pay so much.

3411,3,2009-01-11T20:21:41.000Z,old_school1960,good but...,Good but not exactly what I was hoping for.  It would be nice to have more freedom to just enter caloric intake on some items rather than to have to estimate oz's etc. till I get close to the actual calorie amount.  I keep close tabs on what I am eating - and watch labels.  I would be able to enter more precisely what i've eaten if the app allowed.,
3412,5,2009-03-30T21:09:47.000Z,Jusco,Works great!,I've used it for about a month now and it works great. It all depends on how much you're willing to put into it. It can be a bit tiring putting in how many calories you eat every meal but it's eye opening when you realize just how many calories certain foods have.,

I get a poor rating for a healthy salad with tuna but Hostess cupcakes and combos get the highest rating for a snack? Today the app started crashing after exactly 8.2 seconds from opening.

It does seem to have a little math difficulty (I entered two beverages at 4 calories each, and it is showing the total so far as 7?)  It would be nice if they would add a place to enter cholesterol, if you are watching that in your diet as well.  For under a dollar, it's a good little ap to keep careful track of your calories - something I have never been able to do with any consistency!",

Why does it still insist, to recommend recipes with fish and meat? One can eat a healthy diet without killing sentient beings.

The format of this app is great and I like that aspect a lot. However, the rating system is very, very poor. How can coconut oil be rated an ""E"" or an organic fully green juice a ""D""? It seems this app takes data from the early 90's to rate the food rather than current nutritional information. There should be an option to turn off the rating system as it has me questioning my meal choices when, in reality, they're some of the healthiest options.",

With not spending any money, I couldn't do very much or track very much. I didn't even keep the app for very long because almost everything I clicked on was something I had to pay for.

It doesn't let me add my own nutritional information or at least let me import the info from a recipe I used online (one that wasn't provided by the app). That would make things helpful.

When I entered it into the iPad, it synced with the iPhone and my computer site. Now, it does not. I do not want to enter everything more than once, nor do I want to wait until I have access to the iPad or computer. My iPhone is the quickest way to keep track, but I like to review and keep notes on the iPad or computer.  If everything would sync again, it would be the perfect app it was before. As of right now, I will not be renewing my Gold Membership. It's no longer worth it.",

When I tried it kept adding the same exercise again and again. Now my entire diary is all jacked up. Read directions for app and online and could find no guidance for this other than swiping left to delete which I tried and didn't work. Reset app and phone to no avail.

Any update to this would be greatly appreciated since I like using this app so much.,
3521,5,2015-10-07T17:47:11.000Z,Bs812,Excellent for my limited use case,I am really benefitting from this app but I must say that I'm only using it to track food consumption and water consumption. It does that very well. I find many of the foods I eat already in the database and I have added a few custom recipes of things I often eat. It's really raising my awareness of my food intake.,

Contacted customer support by email and got the run around with computer generated messages. It has been a week now and still no refund or anything. I don't recommend this app to anyone,

That is the MOST the average person should attempt to lose (or you are actually losing muscle as well). There should at least be additional options to lose 1 pound and 1.5 pounds per week. Also you should be able to adjust the percentages of protein, fat and carbs if you are following, say, a lower carb diet.",

The interface is much better than MyFitnessPal but basic functionality that MyFitnessPal does for free costs $3/month or more in Lifesum.

By then the problem might be resolved or you have lost two days on the system tracing calories & exercise.  Would not recommend due to the sporadic nature of service and very generic customer service.",
3562,5,2011-09-19T22:18:42.000Z,Mummy2twomunchkins,Great Weight Loss Tool!,This is an excellent tool for losing weight by tracking calories.  I have been using it for 5 weeks and have lost 10 pounds and it's free!  Don't really need the gold.  Only negative is that the exercise calories are WAY off.  They are much too high so I have created my own exercises with mote realistic calories burned.,
3563,5,2013-02-04T14:50:54.000Z,AoHines7,Great way to hold yourself accountable!,I have really been able to keep up with what I'm eating & it helps me make better choices. I love being able to scan  barcodes too. Before this I would try to mentally keep track of what I was eating & that was ineffective. Definitely recommend this app!,
3564,4,2015-09-09T21:16:13.000Z,Woodenfreakbot,Great app but I have one suggestion,"I really like the app because it helps me focus on how much and what I need to eat to live healthy. I just wish that the Apple Watch version would support voice integration. For example, it would be great to just tell the app on the watch what I just ate, instead of just giving me the option between small, medium, and large meal input.",
3565,4,2015-09-27T12:54:44.000Z,Jewel Daab,Switched from MFP,I've used My fitness Pal for three years now and have managed to lose 70 lbs and manage it. I recently discovered Lifesum when browsing apps and decided to check it out. I like the interface and design over MFP and it seems like this app is on the right track. Looking forward to updates and improvements in the coming months.,
3566,4,2016-01-19T14:54:51.000Z,Valerie__Hogan,Still needs work,"Love the design, UI is alright. Adding food via scanning is nearly always incorrect and won't let me edit it if it's ""already in the system"". Doesn't  sync correctly to my Fitbit and I can't see my calories burned until the day ends. Customer service has been no help. Also, I wish there was a way to track cups of coffee / caffeine intake.",
3567,5,2017-02-13T00:14:31.000Z,Ardenchild22,Love!,What a great app! I love that it helps me see not only how many calories I've had but also the nutrients and if I'm on track or not with my healthy choices. I did opt to not have my exercise count in with my calories for the day because it was saying I needed to eat more due to my workout. Easy fix. I love it!,

Shouldn't it still help, regardless? I could get a similar app (fitness pal) and get some of the features that this app locks up. The only reason why I stick with it is because of the little smileys and the overall appearance is a good change from the other app.",

I do not want a free trial of something that will be paid later on, so the app gave me no choice but to go through the trouble of throwing it out and reinstalling the previous version. Now of course all of my data is gone. I paid for the app a long time ago when I bought it, making me pay more in order to continue to use it is just obnoxious. Zero stars would be better.",
3573,5,2011-05-23T13:29:01.000Z,Sharron Mathews,Great App!,Very helpful with weight and calorie management. My whole family uses the app to keep calorie intake and portion size control in the right limits. I've used this app since March 2010 and not experienced many glitches at all. No glitches in the past many months. There have been many updates.,
3574,5,2016-06-09T03:43:05.000Z,HappyDieter,Helpful and user friendly,This app makes it so easy to track calories and input exercise. It has so many food choices and portion sizes.

I like the tracking and accountability but accurate this app is not. I will continue to use the app mainly because I paid for the year after that I am not sure.,

3583,4,2015-11-10T16:01:55.000Z,Ams5213,Easy to use,I think that this program is very easy to use and I love how it tracks the water that you drink and reminds you actually drink because sometimes I forget whenever I'm busy. I like the recommended recipes that they have I wish that they would use a larger variety and maybe even show community and start a blog section.,

It's based on a balance between carbs, protein, and fat, which seems like a good idea. However, it doesn't work in practice. I put my lunch in today - a salad and some steamed vegetables and it gave me a D because it said both were heavy in carbs. So, I add in the two chocolate cookies I had, and it jumps up to a C! How does that make any sense?",

I definitely think that Lifesum is interactive and a good guide to beginning to record meals and dietary habits. A constructive thing I might add to the app is the ability to edit items, meals, foods added (interns of nutrition tables).",
3696,5,2017-03-16T16:41:00.000Z,Frannieks,Love it!,This app has helped me keep track of what I'm eating.

Having said that, I do wish you could create separate profiles and weight loss plans.  The preloaded foods needs to be expanded as well, perhaps a tie in with the restaurant app allowing the calorie info to import into your daily count.",

Even if my food item wasn't in the database there is an easy way to add your own food by entering calories, fat, fiber, carbs, protein, etc. I have lost 15 pounds since Feb. 1st using weight watchers and this app. I LOVED it, until the new update today took away the ability to track points! Does anyone know of a good app that tracks points like this one did? I am seriously so disappointed!",

I find that at any age you can set goals and you don't have to be limited by your age. It says 4+ on the AppStore but I guess it was a lie. She was so upset and she wanted to try it out because she had an AppleWatch of her own.,We are sorry to hear she was disappointed. We believe that as a teenager this should not be easily accessible due to the susceptibility to body ideals and such. At a young age this can do more damage than good as we can not supervise our users closely as an app.

These are easy to enter and once you have a few meal items (or meals as the food entries are easily defined either way) in the database it takes no time at all to do the diary.

It is SO motivating for me and I'm so thankful I found it, because it has helped completely transform my eating habits. The app itself is designed very well (love the graphics, colors, and animations). I really love the food diary, meal and day ratings, lifescore, the different food/water trackers, as well as the daily and meal-specific calorie tracker. The ratings are what really help me, because they guide me on what foods are best and not-so-good for my health and for my goals. The smileys are awesome. Lifesum even has a weight/body measurement tracker so you can see how many pounds you have lost/gained, as well as an exercise tracker so you can see how many calories you have burned, which is so helpful. I purchased the premium version pretty quickly after downloading, and while it is a little more than I'd like to pay yearly, it's definitely worth it in the long run for me personally.",Thank you very much for your detailed feedback!

Ridiculous.,"When you purchase a Premium subscription you can either choose to be charged monthly (1-month subscription) or you can pay in advance (all other subscriptions).

5372,2,2009-06-21T17:16:57.000Z,Goody2211,"User updatable online database a good think, but a fiasco in practice; Cumbersome to add food/recipe","Tracks water. It does not track sodium although screen shots of the upcoming version suggest that sodium will be trackable. While you can enter total fat, you cannot break out the saturated fat or trans-fatty acid numbers. It covers the other major nutritional items and gives you the daily totals of each. Foods are in categories and that works most of the time. However, why are muffins under snacks and not under breads? You can edit just about everything, and there's a trash can where you can go and undelete an item you've deleted. I can add an exercise and edit it. I can ""edit"" a database exercise but the only thing I can change is the name. Can edit everything about custom foods as well as database foods. When I add a new food to the database, I can't enter the nutritional information by serving as it is listed on the food label -- I have to enter it based on 1 of whatever measurement I've chosen. While on the one hand this makes sense, on the other, I now have to have a calculator so I can convert the nutritional information from the food label serving size to 1 of my measurement. That's what computers are for -- I don't want to have to have a calculator on hand when I'm doing my data entry into the app. I could enter a recipe from a cookbook that already has the nutritional values as a custom food. However, if I'm cooking a recipe that does not already have the nutritional values I have to figure it all out manually before I enter it as a custom food in this application. When I add a food to my diary, one of the categories I can select is ""Brand Name"" but it's empty. When I search for a brand food, for example ""General Mills"" nothing is found, so I have to do an online search. I saved a cereal from my online search for ""Genera Mills""; *now* if I go to ""Brand Name"" category I see an entry. If I search for ""Cheerios"" on line, there are tons of entries for ""Cheerios"" -- all different (two different ""1 cup"" servings had totally different nutritional information) -- so I either have to sift through them all to find the accurate entry for my serving type or I have to create my own entry, which would then end up as still another ""Cheerios"" entry in the on line database, adding to the chaos. The on line database needs more brand foods and restaurant foods and once that's done, the on line database needs to be cleaned up. That would solve the problem of everyone making their own entries a la this ""Cheerios"" example. We cannot use this app right now because some of the nutritional items we need to track are not available. When the next version comes out and if tracking the additional nutrition items, cleanup of the online database, food entry with ""per serving"" data entry of nutritional values, and recipe entry with generating of nutritional values are added we'll be happy to use this app and will change the score.",

What an excellent app,"I never write reviews, but this one is so good that I felt compelled to applaud the developers and company in general. Can‚Äôt believe how robust this app is and how simple it is to compile ‚Äúmeals‚Äù out of individual ingredients just by scanning a bard code, and saving them for use later.

The reason why we currently only have two options available is due to our current calculation of daily energy requirements. We are calculating the daily energy requirement based a validated equation called The Harris‚ÄìBenedict equations revised by Mifflin and St Jeor, were we calculate the BMR and then multiplying it by the given activity level. This equation take into account variables such as sex, age, height, weight and goal weight. Unfortunately, there are only two sexes available for the equation - male or female. In order for us to proivde the correct nutritional guidance for our users, we currently only have these two available. We are, however, currently working on a better solution for this, as we of course want to be able to include all people - and guide them towards a healthier life though better eating."

The water log on the watch app is supposed to be easy, but it‚Äôs needlessly frustrating, making you choose between a full cup or a full bottle for one-touch input. You have go into the settings to change the amounts each time you want to log a different type. I assume this is because goals are set as cups/bottles per day, but people don‚Äôt always drink water out of the same size containers every time every day. I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt just input by ounces. It‚Äôs also not possible to edit your intake via the app, so good luck if you don‚Äôt have a watch, and don‚Äôt have a 8.45oz cup or 16.91oz bottle. Most of my daily logs are inaccurate so the water feature is pretty irrelevant and needs a major overhaul.","Many thanks for your review!

Everything works great for the most part other than some rare times the app doesn‚Äôt boot and my phone requires a restart to get it working. My main problem lies in the lack of sharing towards others who use the same app. For example, my sister made a different more low calorie lasagna but even after making the recipe and putting the steps on Lifesum, she couldn‚Äôt send it to me. I know there is a feature coming where you can share recipes with people, but if we could add to that and make a way to also friend other people, it would allow some cool features like looking at more creative recipes other people might‚Äôve made, as well as ingredients people have favorited.","Thank you very much for your feedback, and well done on the streak!

5604,4,2021-03-23T19:14:48.000Z,AngelaElizondo252009,"Good, but needs some work","Great calorie counting app that has a bar code feature to make calorie counting super streamlined. I also like that is breaks down your meal into grams carbs, fat, and protein.  I don‚Äôt like how it rates food by smiley faces because it is not very accurate. I am not diabetic and using the classic diet plan, but it rates a medium apple as not a good snack food. I can tell you that an apple is a much better snack than chips, yet they get practically the same rating?? Other things that don‚Äôt make sense or could be changed: it adds your calories from exercise to the total number of calories you need to consume. In other words, the app wants you to eat as many calories as you burn???? The whole point of exercise to help you create a calorie deficit to lose weight. If you burn 600 calories working out and then go eat several slices of pizza you just defeated the whole point!!! Because of this the app always shows that I am consuming only 700-800 calories a day, but in reality I am consuming about 1300 a day and also exercising. I also don‚Äôt like that you cannot adjust your daily goal calorie intake‚Äî I would like to choose 1300, but the app is set at 1500, so I just watch the total number of calories consumed instead of looking at how many calories I have left. If you are total novice at portion control, healthy eating, and exercise this app could make it difficult to actually lose weight. I also don‚Äôt like that I have to manage my progress by weight unless I wantto purchase  the deluxe version. I don‚Äôt need meal prep plans, meal ideas, or all the other bells and whistles. I would like to track my weight by body measurements, which is a much more accurate approach since a person can gain and lose up to 4 lbs on average during a day in water weight alone. Also measuring by inches instead of lbs is less disheartening for the above mentioned reason. I just track this on a weakly basis on my own, but the stupid app asks me every morning to input my weight. Overall good for calorie tracking if you are mindful of the pitfalls.",

The food tracker is so dumbed-down, it lacks the option to customize your entries in the most basic ways. For example, you tap a water glass icon to enter your water but you can‚Äôt adjust glass size- it‚Äôs 8oz or nothing. My glasses are 12oz pints. Yes, I can do the math but for a $49.99 app, I shouldn‚Äôt have to. It also doesn‚Äôt sync accurately with my Fitbit. Only a fraction of my steps show up in Lifesum- it seems to sync once early in the day but doesn‚Äôt update. I do like the look of the interface and the way it shows your macros- very easy to read & understand.

However, when purchasing a subscription I was confused because I thought I had bought the one year subscription, for only $3.69/ month, but I was charged $47.80. I say this was confusing because these numbers were right next to each other and I thought I‚Äôd only get charged $3.69. This was extremely inconvenient and I think they should definitely clarify what you‚Äôre paying for and how much will be charged instead of just throwing both numbers out there.","When you purchase a Premium subscription you can either choose to be charged monthly (1-month subscription) or you can pay in advance (all other subscriptions).

Additionally, it has a giant box that says ‚Äúeat healthy, not hangry‚Äù at the top when you don‚Äôt meet your calorie goal, and this isn‚Äôt something I appreciate given current food shortages in stores from COVID-19. I also think saying I should eat ‚Äúhealthy, not hangry‚Äù because ‚Äúmy friends will appreciate it‚Äù misses the mark.

That‚Äôs absurd considering I put in the same information (height, weight, etc.) on a separate website and I was told I needed to take in at the most 1700-2300 calories a day depending on how active I am during the day, to lose weight. The math doesn‚Äôt add up and it‚Äôs kind of frustrating to have the app telling me I‚Äôm failing at meeting my daily goals outside of my 2 fasting days.

5685,4,2019-05-12T21:53:35.000Z,Veenie81,Calorie counter is TOO HIGH,"This would be a great app, but it allows you to eat too much. I know it‚Äôs healthy to do so, but I‚Äôd rather it allow me to lose weight faster by limiting my calories a lot more. Other research has shown me that it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to eat less than the 1600 calories LifeSum believes I should eat to ‚Äúlose‚Äù weight as fast as it will let me. I end up gaining weight instead even if it‚Äôs perfectly clean eating because that‚Äôs A LOT of food. Sometimes I‚Äôm sedentary so I logged my lifestyle in to fit a diet for that, but 1600 is impossibly high for my low metabolism to keep up with & I start to feel bigger and bigger & the scale reflects that. I do want to be more active, but that has nothing to do with the app so any progress I make that way is now help from LifeSum. Many other approved sites suggested I subtract 500 calories a day from my regular intake (about 1600 more or less) to lose 1 lb (3500 cal) a week. And then raise my cal intake back up to 1300-1400 to maintain my weight once I reach my goal. So if I don‚Äôt BURN 500 extra cal per day while eating 1600 cal, I‚Äôll never see progress, and I may actually see worse. It‚Äôs annoying that it will not let me lower the counter one bit. 1600 cal is hardly a weight loss diet for anyone! It‚Äôs just about normal for maintaining for most people (especially sedentary) & easily well fit for GAINING for sedentary or less active people in general.","Thanks for you feedback! Our normal plans/diets are calculated on an individual calorie goal, based on the Harrys Benedict formula. This formula gives us the BMR (basic metabolic rate) and then, depending on activity level and goal, we calculate the users TEE (total energy expander). We do not recommend a deficit of more than -500 kcal per day since that has been proven less successful for a long term weight loss. A larger deficit than that also makes it very hard to retain muscle mass."

I am now attempting a lifestyle change again and logged in to my account using the email I originally purchased my membership under. The app now tells me I need to resubscribe to premium and am only on a free access account. On the free account you can‚Äôt use the Keto diet plans. I should not have to resubscribe when I already purchased a subscription that has 2 more active months. This app stole money from me by changing my account status without my consent.

Well when I selected this package and allowed it to charge my card, the total said $47.51. At this point it had already processed through and the only thing I could do was cancel the subscription, which I did immediately. I also immediately contacted the app support and informed them of the situation. I didn‚Äôt hear anything back from them, and the next day I got a receipt from apple saying the charge went through. I contacted them as well and only received an automated message back saying they could do nothing about it.

I expected that I would be charged monthly as it was advertised but when I received an email with my bill I was charged the full $44.99. I reached out via email to ask about this and get a refund and the company responded that I must get permission from Apple iTunes to get this refund. So now I have to jump through hoops to get my money back and what is their response when I ask why it is advertised that way instead of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù or ‚Äúhow else can we help?‚Äù?? That I should have read the purchase before subscribing. Now that is just sneaky. Do NOT advertise your company as being a monthly payment then charge people the full amount. I‚Äôm sure it was written somewhere in tiny font that no one can even read. That is just bad customer service too. I am very disappointed with this company and how they handled this.,"We are sorry to hear this!

I love the setup, the meal ratings, the tips & the ease of use but I‚Äôve found that SO MANY food nutrients are incorrect, even when scanned. For example: International Delight Sugar free Coffee Creamer is labeled on the bottle as <1 carb per tablespoon. When scanned it says 0 everything & even when I go in to manually edit the food for correct information it changes back to the original incorrect information. I was trusting the info in the app when scanned & thought wow I can have more than I thought. Come to find out my few cups of coffee with cream that I thought was no carbs was actually 9g of carbs! That‚Äôs half a days worth of carbs in 3 cups of coffee üò≥ also Ground Cinnamon says you are -2.5 per teaspoon; also incorrect. I scanned the label & got so excited that I was negative carbs! Wrong again. I had to go out of my way to find the correct nutrients online & come to find out it actually was adding carbs. Too late though, cause I had already ate the food. I feel that paying $49.99 for a yearly subscription is extreme when I have to go out of my way to research anyway to ensure what is in your system is correct. I really loved this app until I found out that information on things I‚Äôve been eating was wrong. Now I‚Äôm questioning if I‚Äôve even been in ketosis at all because who knows now what my carb intake, fats, & proteins really were for all the times I just scanned & trusted your system. Also with the exercises, there are so many standard ones that aren‚Äôt even listed.

I chose the Keto Strict, and will move to Keto Moderate when I‚Äôm ready however there are many great options with inspiring meal plans, Mediterranean, etc.   I never knew how sated I could feel.

This makes me want to buy myself more calories and fat just by exercising‚Äîagain and again. The app made me feel good about not following it perfectly.

5733,3,2018-03-06T17:45:14.000Z,Ugvicmk,Needs net carbs calculation,"Pretty good app. Recipes are great. What is seriously lacking for Keto diets is the calculation of net carbs. For a day that is limited to 20g carbs, the app calculates based on carbs and not net carbs (g carbs - g fiber), so you have to manually calculate how many carbs you have left and be ‚Äúout of sync‚Äù with the apps recommendations.

To be fair, it might take some time to get a hang of logging certain things, but I keep finding new features and I love it! As a rule I never buy premium versions of apps (with the exception of Spotify) but I bought the premium version of LifeSum and I don‚Äôt regret a penny of it. This has helped me out so much - I highly recommend the Clean Eating Plan, or the Keto Easy Plan (even if you aren‚Äôt keto ‚Äî I‚Äôm not, but I am trying to cut down on carbs and Keto Easy helps so much).

Most of the functions now require you to buy a ShapeUp Club Gold monthly subscription account or go to their website for their ""online food database, containing 400,000+ foods."" Umm, I think that defeats the purpose of buying an ""app"". If I wanted to go to my computer & browse the web, why would I pay you a subscription to be limited to just you site?...because it syncs to your app?

This app does that quite well. And it is pretty simple to use. Only issue is that you have to sign-up with Shape Up Club for a rather high price to access all features.

5818,3,2011-01-04T18:25:12.000Z,Bri_something,Basic but very helpful. (pre-update),"I am happy with this app. Not thrilled but happy. It's helped me lose 5 pounds in 4 days (since beginning my New Year's Resolution) but that is a testament to counting calories in general. I enjoy very low-cal crash diets and this app doesn't hassle you about not eating enough like others do so that's a plus. I often have to enter my ready-meals myself as this app doesn't have as many entries (brands and varieties) in its database as I would like. It doesn't do anything special but definitely serves its purpose and was free when I uploaded it. However, I am reading the newest reviews and see that it is no longer a free service as of the update. Some have mentioned a recurring membership fee?!? I'm sorry you guys were duped but I thank you so much for warning me before I updated this app. I do like this app but it is not worth paying for. Sorry. If you folks are willing to pay, I'd recommend the Calorie Counter Pro by MyNetDiary which is much more comprehensive and user-friendly. No recurring membership fees, just $2.99 up front and worth every penny. I was unable to transfer that app to my new iPhone4 because my MacBook operating system is antiquated so I tried this app instead. I will continue to use this for as long as I can without updating but I would not pay for it. It just isn't worth the money. Especially since I have no interest in joining their club. I just want to log the calories I eat and burn and there are other apps that make doing so simpler and more fun.",
5819,5,2011-01-05T19:32:00.000Z,Amyn119,Calm down people,"I updated this app to v3.3.1. My backup data is still saved within my iphone. You only need to sign up for the account and get the Gold feature for 3 months such as complete sync etc. After gold expire, you'll status is just back to free account like before, and you still can use this app for its core feature. The free account is only lack feature of complete sync(etc.?), and you can only backup your data for last 1 month(maybe?), the data older than that will be deleted. I still love this app.",

5822,4,2011-01-26T00:49:26.000Z,DyWalkr,Pretty good,"I have used this program on and off for three years. I always lose weight when I use it. I generally get tired of entering everything I eat individually and wish the database had more commercial items, like common restaurant items at major chains. Even if the exact item I ate wasn't in there, I could more easily find a substitute. It's a good program overall and for the price I think it's a great deal.",

The two searches I did--eggos and Illy--were found immediately by the MFP app, but this one required the qualifier ""waffles"" to be appended to ""eggos"" and only found ""Illy"" as parts of other words (e.g., Philly). You've got the form nailed--make the function match it, and you'll have a 5-star app.",

5827,4,2010-12-11T20:59:02.000Z,Livy Lou 42,Overall good app.,"I like the app. However, I think there should be away to manually write your own fat, protein, and carbs in as a custom meal. It will allow you custom calories, but why not further that and also allow the fat, protein, and carbs which should then auto calculate the calories. There are times when there are unique foods you cannot search for, and would be easier just to estimate the fat, protein, and carb grams manually. If you could do that, I would give it 5 stars.",
5828,5,2010-12-13T15:50:17.000Z,Ej_lookin_boy,Wonderful management tool,"I like counting calories instead of points (too complicated). This is easy to use, has an extensive food database plus you can add your own favorites and custom meals. I've tried other apps but keep coming back to this one for its simplicity.",
5829,4,2010-12-14T00:34:10.000Z,Marie8171673,Good program,"This is a good program for different weight loss Programs since it easily tracks protein, carbs and fat along with calories on the home screen.  Lots of settings for goal planning and like yhat you can go online on pc or Mac and print stats out for a week or month, etc.  Food database isn't as robust as others I've used, but still good.

However, it's extremely biased towards on the calories-in-calories-out paradigm. There are very few customization options for paying members. For instance, there is no way to easily view net carbs, and viewing the carb breakdown takes several clicks. The weekly graphs dont display much more than your caloric intake, which is frustrating if you are trying to figure out how you did on your macros. There's some weekly test that a)doesn't work most of the time and then b)grades your responses by some pop culture nutrition nonsense. There is also an annoying emoji that reprimands at ever.single.meal if you for not adhering to the standard American diet. Most of the navigation options are useless. Why are plans so incredibly persistent? I don't need to see that all the time after I've picked a plan. Strangely, low carb and keto plans are listed, but they lack any customization options. You're stuck with whatever white girl nonesense the app has decided is good for you.","Thanks for this great and detailed feedback, we really appreciate it."

It is cheaper to be fat than to loose weight. This app proves that. $44 a year. Every app cost a fortune. Add to that the cost of eating healthy, which is much more expensive than eating junk food. No wonder so many people die fat. Waiting for the day when it is cheaper to eat healthy and to loose weight. Until then, guess I need to look for another app to help me.Edit: Fitbit sync fir free would really be nice.

For instance it told me that 4 large eggs had 135 carbs. Ummmm...escuse me? I didn't eat Cadbury eggs, just regular 'ol chicken eggs. That was more carbs than I was supposed to eat for the day.
