0,5,2018-10-07T13:03:20.000Z,Crmnvds,So elegant and visually appealing,"What a gorgeous app- that alone makes me want to open it and track. I love that it there's a water tracker, daily fruit and vegetable and weekly seafood tracker and that they give you a life score with details on what to improve each week. Sure, a few glitches like not currently syncing with Health app (I open both then close both and open once more then it tracks), and the recipes and sometimes the database doesn't have the exact food but does have something comparable, just takes a smidgen more work. The beta camera isn't the greatest if you have a deep dish as opposed to a plate but it sure is handy and easy enough to adjust. And there's not many recipes, but the ones available are easy to follow and pleasant to eat, plus how often does one follow a recipe to a T? I've tried other tracking apps (looking at you MFP) and all the ads and monotone color scheme make them too unidimensional- this is beautiful, too beautiful not to use. And the step counter that equates steps to what you burn makes me just competitive enough with myself to make me want to walk even more (I burned 1.5 croissants?!? Bet I can burn 2!). I'd like to buy the app developers a beer. Then go walk said beer off. I saw a couple of review that say the app is rigid in terms of certain foods like sunflowers, and though I appreciate the sentiment, I am using the app for weight loss and do indeed want to know if a food is high in caloric content.",Thank you very very much for your detailed feedback! We are glad to hear that you like Lifesum!
1,5,2018-02-10T14:31:26.000Z,BitsyJo,Beautiful! But could use customized notifications.,"This app is gorgeous! I love the articles and the recipes look absolutely scrumptious. The aesthetics alone are what make this the most effective app, and it is super smooth! Even on this old phone, where everything else crashes. Huge thanks to the devs for achieving this. Now, I turned on notifications expecting reminders to update my water or add my meals and exercise, which would be really nice! Sometimes you get busy and don't track anything; it is the LAST thing on your mind. I did, however, get constant reminders to update my weight. As someone who has a Lifesum of 119 (almost completely perfect! 😲), I find that a little unhealthy. No-one should be weighing themselves every day, especially if you already have an unhealthy relationship with your weight, body fat percentage, or food. Even on a practical level, it doesn't make much sense. So I turned off the notifications, but it would be nice to be able to select what kind of notifications we get in the future! Such as for new recipes or articles, and reminders in other areas of body and health maintenance. Or a way to change the frequency: Weighing yourself every X amount of days. If there is already a way to do this, I hope the settings for it become easier to find. ❤️ Thanks for reading!",
2,4,2021-02-06T23:22:22.000Z,Jackinzi,Beautiful and easy to use with some adaptability issues,"First of all, the visual design of this app is incredible. Other similar apps have designs that make it feel outdated, which in turn can make the data or plans feel outdated even when that’s not true. Gorgeous color scheme, icons, motion design, etc, and lots of great features like the barcode scanner and ability to quickly select previous days’ meals.","Thank you so much for your positive feedback and kind words, we have shared it with the teams in charge! Furthermore, we really apologise for the issue you are experiencing.

3,3,2019-01-30T00:43:11.000Z,stuphunuu,Meal plans impractical,Just downloaded this today and got a premium subscription for 3 mos. Haven’t been able to do much but most of the features seem nice! I like that it tells you how good certain foods or meals are for you and tracks how “on track” you are. It puts it a step ahead of most other trackers I’ve seen.,"Thank you for sharing your thoughts on our app! The meal plans are designed to be a kick-starter to your diet and are supposed to last a short period of time. It is possible to swap meals throughout the week in order to eat the same meal each day, so there are small adaptations possible. Thanks again for your feedback and good luck with your goal!"
4,5,2019-10-15T00:23:50.000Z,Liccie D,Delete My Fitness Pal!,"I don’t normally review apps but this is one EVERYONE should definitely try. This is the first app that I’ve actually lost weight with.. it actually helps you develop better eating habits. I know that there’s a lot of hype behind My Fitness Pal, but I swear, after trying both, LIFESUM BEATS MY FITNESS PAL HANDS DOWN. Nearly everything since the app has gone through updates is perfect. The user-face is simple and easy to use, without the annoying ads other apps have. You can adjust everything to fit your personal goals, even if they go beyond what the app recommends. They even include a macro calculator that makes things easy to calculate. The grading scale is really helpful to see where you can improve. It takes everything into account, calories, macros, sugar, fiber... it’s pretty comprehensive. Also, I love that I can keep everything private, it’s not necessarily a competition against all of my Facebook friends. The graphs and diagrams make seeing long term trends quick and easy. One thing I would love to see is something that suggests meals or specific items that would meet the goals of the meal. If I have 200 calories left and haven’t met my protein, fat, or carbs goals, what can I add to my meal that fits my goals? Other than that, the developers have done an absolutely stellar job.","Hi, thank you very much for your 5 star rating and awesome feedback! We were very happy to read that our app has contributed to your healthier lifestyle and we truly appreciate you sharing your success with us. Our developers are collecting all feedback here https://bit.ly/2gB0KKd - we really appreciate all ideas and suggestions for improvement!"
5,4,2020-10-23T23:34:48.000Z,Kcarrasco09,Fun Macro Tracker,"I really love the design of this app and that you can follow plans that will adjust your macros for you. I also like like that you can capture a photo of your food for each meal, however, unfortunately, this functionality doesn’t work most of the time. Once I take a picture it doesn’t show in the app right a way, most of the time I have to take the pic a couple of times, close the app, reopen it and then the pic may or may not show up. So it would be nice if that could get fixed. Also, there isn’t an easy way to copy a meal from another day to a different meal. So if I ate something for breakfast yesterday, there’s no  easy way to copy that to lunch the next day. And when searching for foods, your recents don’t come up. For example, if I wanted to add a food and it’s not showing in my most recent but I’ve logged it before, it would be nice to have it so up in my search when I go to search the food in the search bar. Another thing this app is missing is the ability to see what foods were highest in each macro. So if I wanted to see what foods I ate that day where highest in fat or protein.. Other macro apps have this, which was nice because then you could see what foods may be bumping up a macro too much or vice versa. Overall I have enjoyed this app and really like the design. However there are a few functionalities that are missing.","Hi there, thank you for the valuable feedback! Please feel free to leave suggestions for improvement on our UserVoice: https://lifesum.uservoice.com. Regarding the photo feature please feel free to email us more details directly at contact@lifesum.com so that we can take a closer look at the matter. Thank you!"
6,5,2020-05-16T12:18:16.000Z,Hwbfowuhrofi,"Awesome, but there are some errors.","I’ve been using this app for as long as I can remember and I recently just upgraded to the Premium, which I love! I love the aesthetic of the app and the visuals and colors it uses. I love the wide variety of recipes, even thought I don’t use them that much. I love the weekly rating I get so that I can look at my past week and see what I need to improve on for the next one. However, there are a couple things I find I have trouble with. The main thing is that when I go to update my weight, I check on it the next day and it says “Nothing lost, nothing gained.” So whenever I update my weight and maybe i’ve lost a pound or two, i’ll update my weight. But the next day when I go to look at my weight it erased it or changed it back to the starting weight. It does this almost all the time and is pretty annoying because I have to delete the starting weight that it put it back on for that day, at the same time deleting the weight that I put in. Another thing that’s minor is that when I go to take a picture of my food, sometimes it doesn’t work and the picture never shows up. I do really love this app but I don’t know if anyone else has the weight changing itself issue or not.","We apologize for the issue you are experiencing.

7,5,2020-10-03T16:56:37.000Z,juneauTracy,Love the app as is but would also love upgrades,"I started using Lifesum to track my intake.  It is easy to use and very visual.  However, there are a couple of upgrades I would like seeing.  First, I would like to see Fat broken down into Total, Sat, Monounsaturated, and Polyunsaturated.  I would also like to see Carbs broken down into Total, Fiber, Sugar Alcohols, Added Sugar, and Net Carbs.  (Currently, the app simply subtracts fiber from total carbs to calculate net carbs.). Also, since I work with a functional medicine professional who is interested in seeing my intake, I would like to see the ability to export data.  As I used to program (albeit mainframe),  I know how long upgrades take to implement; it is possible some of these are already in the works.  They were meant only as suggestions.  Long story short, I am very happy with the app as it is even if it misses some of my personal desires.  Thank you for the work you put in to bring such a useful app to market.  Oh, last but not least, I think it would be better to let users know that full, continued use of the app requires a subscription.  The cost is nominal for the usefulness, but it was frustrating when I first found out about the cost after downloading the app.","Thank you so much for your valuable feedback, we much appreciate it! We have sent your feedback to the responsible teams for their knowledge!"
8,3,2020-08-19T15:27:57.000Z,foodeats,"It’ll get the job done, but it could be better","Calorie tracking and dieting options work well and seem to cover a wide variety of needs. It is cumbersome to find the food and/or measurement needed for accurate tracking at times; requiring the user to do some creative math or mental gymnastics to figure out what should be entered. I paid for a membership and feel it’s okay—I won’t likely be renewing. The recipes offer some tasty and decently filling alternatives, but are HORRIBLY written, as often as not. If you’re not familiar with finagling and “figuring out” a recipe or if that type of this is frustrating, this is not the app for you. This feels most functional for a few scenarios: first, the casual user who already has a decently healthy understanding of food, quantities, cooking, etc., and is just looking for a little guidance, new ideas for recipes or to literally track calories. Second, any of the diets, I’d bet, would work if you’re a person who can follow the recipe EXACTLY (I follow “classic” and “vegan” but would struggle with both if I didn’t already have experience eating/cooking alternative foods).  This WOULD NOT be for the user who doesn’t really know at least some about healthy eating (novice) nor would it be for the serious weight loss/health person (expert) as it just doesn’t support specifics well enough.",Thank you for the feedback!

9,1,2019-11-23T23:17:36.000Z,BaeNextDoor,Support unavailable,Loved the interface of this app and found it easy to navigate my way around pretty easily when I did use it. The one star rating is due to my recent experience today. I have tried several times now to contact support through the Contact Us (in app chat) link and it continues to crash. The app is updated to the most recent version and so is the software on my phone. Have tried to resend the message several times and the app keeps crashing. I want to cancel my subscription and plan on deleting the app TODAY. I purchased the Premium version of the app about a year ago at a discounted rate during a promo offer they had at the time. They seem to have it set it up where you subscribe to their Premium services outside of iTunes so the subscription is actually processed through their own website. Renewal dates or expiration dates of said Premium services are nowhere to be found anywhere in the app. They then attempt to auto renew it later on at almost $50 USD with no communication beforehand via email or otherwise that they will be processing this amount. I did not even locate the option to downgrade my account or cancel anywhere within the Settings option within the Lifesum app. Luckily my bank caught the attempted transactions as fraud and did not allow them through. I’ll stick to apps that allow me to manage my subscriptions within iTunes to avoid headaches like this.,Thank you very much for reaching out to us!
10,1,2018-04-16T05:53:39.000Z,TheDMTD,Won’t let you choose water bottle size,Update 2: Finally responded to my actual review. But they still are not going to implement the simple feature. I’m extremely disappointed that they are not prioritizing customer concerns.,Thanks again for your feedback! We are very sorry that you feel that way. Currently there are no plans to implement any changes when in comes to the bottle size in the near future. We are sorry that we cannot be of more help in this case.
11,5,2018-05-01T23:30:47.000Z,Deekajane,Great app that’s sure to get even better,"Ive been using Lifesum for a couple months now. Honestly I don’t use it everyday (I don’t track on weekends) but I love it! I love the look of it and the fun and encouraging tone. Love being able to see my macros front and center and seeing how my meal is looking on carbs, fat and protein. Two edits: as a previous review stated, notifications could use some work. Don’t need to weigh myself every single day, and also don’t need notifications for things I’ve already done (like log breakfast, etc.). Also get a note at 6 asking how my dinner was and I don’t eat til about 7:30 bc of my commute (this notification reminds me how much I hate it!! lol).",Thank you very much for your feedback!

I like organization when I diet and i just wish you could more closely edit your planner from day to day. How it is set up now- you have to scroll through all of the days and once you finish one day you have to scroll alllllll the way back down to the next day. Also, not sure if it’s just a diet they are trying to promote, but no matter what answers I choose when taking the quiz I always get the Keto Burn. I don’t necessarily have a problem with this diet, I just would like to see what other diets I could choose from that would also be recommended. If I am just overlooking how to do this please let me know! Other than these two things I am very impressed with the app and how affordable it is!","Thank you for rating our app - we truly appreciate your feedback!

I’ve been using it since late December and recently switched to premium a couple weeks ago. While I don’t regret going premium because of all the additional features, this app is far from perfect. My main complaint is that the entries could stand to be more consistently regulated across the board. Often times I’ll see multiple entries for the same product, all different from one another, yet still all somehow verified by Lifesum with the blue tick. Sometimes the difference in nutrition info between these listings has to do with how the person entered in the serving size, but other times all the nutritional information is out of whack on two or more listings of what is allegedly the same product. This kind of negates the convenience of being able to just quickly search up a food and add it to your diary. I end up adding most of my food manually in order to be sure my entry is accurate. Even when I scan barcodes, I double check the entered nutritional info with the info on the label. All in all, unless this changes and the info on the app becomes more reliable, I’ll probably try another similar app when my membership is up, maybe MyFitnessPal.",Thank you for your review.

If a smooth flow and  easy navigation is important to you this might be a great place to start in your search for the perfect dieting app.  In addition to the look and feel it also has some great content.  My wife and I both tried the Paleo Diet for the first time in our lives. We loved the diet and everything it had to offer.  We also both experienced incredible results in both energy and weight loss.,Thank you very much for your review! We will inform the responsible team regarding your feedback. This is definitely valid points. We will be continuously working on more features so hopefully we will be able to soon improve your experience.
15,2,2020-09-13T05:07:55.000Z,CSnotLewis,"Awful navigation, terrible tracker","This hets 2 stars instead of 1 because i do actually use it to track, mostly because there’s little better out there. But the rest of the app is total garbage. It is inaccurate and poorly sourced, confusing to navigate if you want to change your plan, and the nutritional meals are extremely confusing. First, it only allows you to choose one dietary choice. For example, i try and eat a low carb diet but i ALSO want to keep that diet by eating clean and whole foods. But i have to choose one or the other. I am a pescatarian, and for some reason I still get recipes that suggest chicken or other meat. Also the “nutritional tracker” is literally never happy—you could have the healthiest meal and it will say you are nutritionally off track because you didn’t hit *exactly* the nutritional intake it demands to the exact gram. If you have baked salmon, an extremely healthy food with lean protein and omega 3’s it says the meal is “too high in fat,” the same as if you had pizza. It doesn’t differentiate between good fats and bad. There’s no pleasing the nutritional tracker. It is annoying to search for recipes, and it seems like just a way for celebrity fitness influencers to make even more money when this could be an actual social app for real users to share recipes, exercises, and fitness data. What a waste.","We are very sorry to hear that you feel that way! We will make sure your feedback reaches the responsible teams.

16,3,2020-04-24T15:16:27.000Z,Mijuto82,Keep Improving This App,"I use a few apps for recipes already. Those apps all include nutrition values and labels. It would be nice if I could import/share those into lifesum without having to manually enter everything one at a time. A few of them have options to add those values to Apple health directly from the app. Lifesum writes data to health, but does not read. I think it would almost be better to separate functions out to apps. Have food apps handle entering / removing data into health and then have trackers reading and analyzing what you just ate so you can make informed decisions. I’d rather have two clean apps rather than one bloated app. I would imagine narrowing the scope would take out a lot of the overhead needed to maintain and update the app, thus making it even more clean and user friendly. Anyways, this is just my observation after using lots of food tracking apps. The interface may be different but functionally they are all kinda doing the same thing. I would also like to see more support for the Apple Watch when it comes to simple things like adding water and quick calories. The front end of this app is really beautifully done.

However, when you go to enter the food choices several different versions of that food pop up all with caloric differences for the same food. I weigh my foods, & I see different caloric amounts for the weights of the same food. For example, Red grapefruit will have a few different choices to select from but no matter the ounces, the calories will slightly differ 30-50 cals. I don’t understand this & it can be very frustrating. & makes me feel as though my efforts are not always accurate & ultimately a wasteful purchase. The app has a nice design but could be better. Another feature that is annoying is if you want to review past food logs, & u leave the app open & go to do something else on your phone if you click back to the app it will reset to you viewing the food log of the current day. Which if you had to scroll back 8 days, you’d have to scroll back 8 days again even if you just go to do something else even though the app is open which again is annoying & there should be a better way to compare past to future logs.

I like that it offers many different plans and gives you instant feedback on the quality of food you are eating, but many of the features advertised do not work properly. For example, I chose the three week weight loss plan. It generated recipes and a shopping list, which I thought was cool. But it does not let you add the recipes directly to your food diary -- clicking on the recipe did not do anything and I had to enter each ingredient manually, even though I followed the recipe exactly. This seems like a waste of time and a pretty big thing to overlook. Searching the recipe database for the recipe did not work either, as they are organized by tags and not by title or ingredient, making it even harder to find what you're looking for. I had to delete and reinstall the app to even get the water tracker to show up. There is also no way to manually sync the app with Fitbit; it just kind of does it when it wants to, which I also see as a major flaw. It's a beautiful app, but very clunky and full of dead ends. I paid for premium and at this point I wish I hadn't.",Thank you very much for your feedback! The idea behind the 3 weeks weight loss is that the user just has to track by clicking on the meal and not think about calorie counting. That's why the calories are not mirrored in the Diary. But it seems that we have to make that clearer so thank you for your feedback. The trackers do not show in the plan as well but will appear again as soon as you finish the 3 weeks weight loss.

I have been a paid subscriber for about 4 years now but am thinking that I might not be renewing this year. I’m not sure if the problem is with the Lifesum app or the Apple Health app, but the nutrition data will just not sync properly from Lifesum to the Health app. I am using the Health app to aggregate all of my health data which syncs properly from my sleep app, glucose app, exercise apps, etc., but not my diet/nutrition app which I consider to be essential for getting a complete health picture. I contacted the developer about this issue but was just told that they were working on it and informed as to how to get a refund and cancel my subscription. That was definitely not the answer I was looking for but may just take them up on it. What I really wanted to hear was a timeframe for getting this right. What I got from the response was that it wasn’t really a priority for them. I would like to know whether it is or not because if it is and they are expecting a breakthrough in the near future I would definitely stick with the app.",Users are currently experiencing issues with the data sync between Health and Lifesum.

It’s awesome when you track your food and are able to see a rating beside what you’ve had. Also, it’s very easy to track your exercise. As of recently, I have purchased an Apple Watch and it makes it even easier because it just takes the activity information from my watch and coverts it into the app. There is also a cool weight tracker you can use to count towards your weight goals. Tracking water intake is also nice and the app even gives you tips and encouraging words to reach your water, calories per meal, and exercise goals. I thought every app like this was the same and they all seemed so hard to figure out. Lifesum is short, sweet, and simple and I give the creators and developers of this app major props because usually I get bored within this category of apps, but this one has kept me focused and excited to use it.

Its not very smart, it doesn’t have a lot of foods in its database, and the recipes provided are few and not impressive. There’s no way to find easy meals, it seems to be time consuming and not super appetizing. For example, a suggested recipe to me was a tomato and buttermilk shake?? While that might not be hard to make, it sounds disgusting. Most of these recipes seem to be more about looks and “instagram” quality than nutrition and simplicity, which is what most people loom to food trackers for. In the app’s attempt to be more millenial-geared and well-rounded, they made a complicated app with a few flashy features (choosing your type of diet, taking a picture of your food to log it-which didn’t work when I tried-, and recipes-which have limited options and seem complicated). I wish they offered a trial of the premium but I understand why they don’t because I definitely wouldn’t have bought premium if I knew that not much would change, and the additional features are less than satisfactory. I absolutely regret purchasing this.","Thank you for your feedback. It’s a big challenge for us to allow people all across the world to track their everyday foods.

Overall discouraging.,"I read so many reviews to find an app to help me keep track of my food intake when I restarted the 5-2 Intermittent Fasting plan. This app does that, but overall is really discouraging and unrealistic. In 7 days of tracking, I have not had ONE meal that was not labeled “imbalanced” on this app. I’m either too high on protein or too high I’m carbs or too high on sugar (ANY meal that includes fruit) and frankly I am already sick of all their frown face icons and impossible standards. Today is my 500 calorie day — just finished dinner of a piece of broiled tilapia and a cup of broccoli with a tiny bit of garlic sauce.  Too high in protein and not enough carbs! For goodness sake, I’m limited to 500 calories! Almost all of my breakfasts have “not enough protein”, yet I looked through all their breakfast recipes and NONE of the low calorie recipes have the amount of protein they recommend.  Last week on my fast day it said I was too low in protein so I ate a hard boiled egg as my snack — and it said it was too much fat. There are no suggestions about alternatives that would be a better choice.  I fear this app has the propensity to lead to disordered eating and obsessing.  Very disappointed and I regret buying a six month membership that is not refundable.","Hi there, thank you so much for your feedback, we much appreciate you sharing it.

I don’t have the premium plan so you can lose weight on it without having to pay for it which is amazing! I will continue to use this app until I reach my goal weight and I truly believe I can do that using This app. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to lose weight while still feeling in control with the classic weight loss plan.,Boom!

However I really have many issues with their nutritional content, so if you’re needing this for something like diabetes where you’re doing insulin to carb ratio’s, or specific dietary needs gastroparesis, reduced fat things, I don’t think I would recommend it. There are many times where I will scan an item in and what presents on the screen is not what is on the label it’s really strange. There are other things were a number of carbs the serving size whatever or just incorrect. Not just of labeled items but regular things like banana whatever. Anyway it doesn’t work all that well when you don’t have exactly the serving size and even then a lot of the time it’s just not right. If you don’t need that level of detail it’s very easy to use and adds everything up for the day for the meal. They only offer one snack per day so if you have three small meals three small snacks, you just have to lump all your snacks into one snack. So if you’re looking at your finger across the day it’s a little in accurate. If it were only that I would recommend it, but there are too many other issues for me","Thank you for your feedback.

I am finding several issues when going into certain screens where the text at the bottom if the screen is “running off” the screen, and I am unable to get out of certain screens because the “X” that you press to close the screen is in the upper left hand corner and it is partially off of the screen and you are unable to push it (the iPhone 12 Pro Max screen is .2” larger, so an update is needed.).","Hi Robert, thank you for your feedback.

I’ve read that the database isn’t as big as MFP but I haven’t run into any problems with being able to track my food or scan barcodes. When I first started using the app I lost 8 pounds in the first few weeks, so I’m finally under 160lbs! I haven’t been very consistent recently but I’ve just picked it back up again tracking calories and staying under my daily goal. I also love how simple it is to track macros. Overall, I’ve been wanting to lose weight for YEARS and stop gaining 10lbs/year on average and this is the FIRST tool I’ve found that has actually helped me make progress. Only negative I have is the meals on the different plans can’t be changed so I can’t really do them because I’m allergic to shellfish (I could probably just substitute though LOL)",Thanks a bunch for your feedback!

The recipes are great, being able to track your meals/diet/and even overall health is very impressive. The only place I would suggest change is, like many have said, the notifications. Unlike most of the other “suggestive criticisms,” though, my chief complaint/wish is that there are never any “night shift mode” capabilities in health tracking. Many of us in healthcare like me and hundreds of other careers have had to switch their lives nocturnal. 24-hour gyms and grocery stores have helped, but there is still so much room for improvement! If there were just a way to tell the apps to switch from breakfast/lunch/dinner at 8-ish, 12-ish, and 6-ish to those equivalents during the night! Or for activity and sleep to be better tracked at the opposite “normal” time!

You can’t customize the macro goals unless you have premium and mine are different from the ones they set for me. The one thing that really irks me is their meal rating system. It doesn’t teach indulgence in moderation, which I think is key to maintaining a healthy diet, and it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. If you eat one sweet thing it ruins your entire meal rating. For example: I had scrambled eggs and protein powder in coffee this morning — it gave both of those an excellent rating on their own, but didn’t give the meal as a whole a good rating because I hadn’t consumed enough calories. Then I had half a serving of honey vanilla Greek yogurt and it gave it a :| rating, which then ruined my whole meal rating. And you can get an explanation for why things are rated that way unless you pay for premium. I try to get good ratings all day so it really bugs me when I get a bad one. I’m starting to just not take them seriously.","Thank you for your review - we appreciate your feedback and it will be shared with the team in charge, for future reference.

The first 10 days of using it, I mostly focused on eating healthy and staying under my daily intake. I lost two pounds and have since incorporated working out in the past week and have lost an additional 1.5 pounds plus 1.25” off of my waist. My pants are beginning to get a little looser and my face is noticeably thinner as well. I’ve been using this app since May 17th and I am happy with my progress so far. I gave the app four stars, however, because I’m paying $21 for three months but the add-ons don’t seem worth the money. I’m grateful for them but they are things so could have figured out with a quick google search.

It works to keep me accountable and mindful of my choices without restricting anything. I like that it connects to my Apple devices and adjusts my available calories based on exercise (the more I exercise, the more I can’t eat)! That feature has been very helpful. The scan tool works mostly well but there have been several items not yet in their database. There is an option to help grow that if you take the time to enter in all the nutritional info on a package. The most difficult thing with this (and all the food logging apps) is entering in homemade food, e.g. the chicken noodle soup I made last Sunday... other than that, I give it 5 stars and will continue to use it. It’s  already had an impact on my lifestyle (and I’ve lost several pounds)!",We love to hear about your success with Lifesum! Keep it up!

36,1,2019-08-02T15:29:02.000Z,EmeraldHayez,Totally Inaccurate,"Lifesum is beautiful and fun. But none of that matters because all the entries are inaccurate or straight up wrong. If I’m going to have the ease of using a barcode, why do I have to put in more work? If you want to be able to accurately measure and count calories, you should use grams. When I use grams on anything, the measurements are totally inaccurate. They’ll make something that should be 200 calories look like 12,000 calories. Or something that should be 600 calories will come out to 3 calories, all because of inaccurate measurements on this app. Even the “verified” entries are wrong. Sometimes I’ll Enter a meal and the calories won’t show up until I fully close the app and reopen. Today I tried to search for an item from McDonald’s, and all the entries were the meal without the biscuit. And even those entries didn’t match! I’ve tried to continue to use the app because I was conned in to paying for a full year. (NOTE: when it says $3/month it’s actually going to charge you for a whole year at one time.) Not worth it. I’ll take my losses and use an app that’s accurate and that doesn’t make me angry because everything is hard to track and everything is just plan WRONG.","Thank you for your feedback and sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with our app. The reason we show the monthly cost, is for our users to see the difference in price from subscribing yearly and monthly.

However, if there is one thing that really ruins my experience, it’s that you cannot view the nutritional values. It is illegal for packaging companies to withhold nutritional facts, and chain restaurants have to offer nutritional values for their food as well in order to “help Americans be healthy”. So why is an app, specifically designed for dieting withholding that information unless you pay for it? I think this is actually quite unjust. Yes, they do display protein, carbs, and fat, however the rest is blocked. The second problem with this app is that there is limited choices for entries. What I mean, is that if you try to log an exercise, there are many that are not included so you must guess on the amount of calories you burned. Additionally, many of the food values and/or portions are incorrect, and many foods are still not on there.",Our product team is collecting all user suggestions directly here: http://lifesum.uservoice.com/forums/274566-feedback-ideas/filters/top

Calories, protein, carbs, fat, etc. It tailors all of it to the specific diet you choose and how much weight (if any) you want to lose, based on your height, weight, and timeframe. Beyond that, it gives you recipes, weekly ratings (in premium version, but the free version is well worth the download too) on how balanced and healthy your diet is, what you can improve on, and even gives you additional trackers for the areas you’re working on. You get fun smiley faces to denote how healthy your food choices are. All in a wonderfully designed and eye pleasing package. They even include stickers too!

I also feel like theres some issues with entering food, I can’t always find what I’m looking for and very often the things I eat don’t have ratings. I’m vegetarian and sometimes I feel that this app doesn’t understand that someone who is a vegetarian or vegan needs different things or nutrients than someone who eats meat. I also feel like the grading/motivation part of this app could use help. As someone who has struggled with eating disorders, the grading can make me feel bad about my eating choices.

However, when I’m eating out, I would like the app to be ready to know and look up what I’m eating. It just makes it a little easier for the user to get an exact match to food while eating out. The other thing is workouts and calories burned. I wish the app would let you track workout videos and burned calories through trackers rather then estimating. It would be a really cool idea to insert a direct link to the video you did, so you can keep track of your fav workouts and closely monitor your progress with said workouts all in one app. Correct me if I’m wrong in thinking this way.

I saw an earlier review saying that daily weigh ins are not healthy, and I completely agree, due to minimal change day to day and fluctuating weight (if you have a cheat day, for example).

The original reason I downloaded this app what is to integrate it with the Walgreens app in order to earn bonus points at that store. Once I open the app, I found it useless. I took all kinds of quizzes which were to determine my eating habits and to suggest diets. I can’t imagine why eating vegetables watch a week or fruits just three times a week would indicate a balanced diet. Then it offered to give me suggestions. After every quiz, in order to get the answers or suggestions or meal plans or diet suggestions I was directed to sign up to get the paid version. This app is a complete rip off. I don’t have to take the time to go onto my phone just to keep track of how many glasses of water I drink! I have chronic kidney disease and was looking for a few other suggestions. Since I have to pay for everything here, I’ll stick to the FREE Davita app. It’s easy to set your calorie goals (along with protein and other nutritional content). You don’t have to have CKD to use Davita, either. Their food database is enormous. Lifesum (free) is useless in conjunction with the Walgreens app.",We are very sorry that you feel that way about the app. Thank you very much for your detailed feedback!

It has some great Keto recipes and gave me planned meals complete with a grocery list for the whole 3 weeks. I really like the look of this app, especially over MFP. However, I find myself unable to do all of the functions that I could in the former. Mostly, editing or even deleting a custom recipe/meal-- I can only add them not get rid of them. Most importantly however, there's issues transferring a tracked meal the app suggests from my paid meal plan into my food diary. The servings get all messed up and the nutritional information gets significantly reduced. This makes me go back and delete/""untrack"" the meal and input it manually, which defeats the point of the feature. I really want to like this app but unfortunately I will not continue using it after my paid trial ends.

68,3,2020-11-20T00:17:13.000Z,AlphaWithLove,Why can’t you delete meals or food?,The premise of this app is great and when it starts listening to Apple health to factor in your exercises it really sets itself apart. Our issue appears to be more of a bug than a missing feature: you can’t delete any meal once you add it. We are in a Keto focus and we cook all our meals from recipes we create (we have a personal menu). When we create a meal with all of the ingredients it exists in the “Meals” section as a choice we have from now on to enter into our diary any given day we may have chosen to eat that meal. But there are meals we made years ago when we tried this app once and didn’t know much about nutrition. And we can’t delete them. A meal just consisting of black beans is in there forever cluttering the list and it can’t be deleted. The same problem occurs in anything added in the food category. It makes daily use of this app cumbersome and overtime it will become so crowded that it will be unusable,"Thank you for reaching out and leaving your feedback!

69,2,2019-08-10T22:30:29.000Z,aretephora,Beautiful UI but not remotely functional,"Giving two stars for the UI. Very visually appealing. But not functional. Lots of basic issues that constrain functionality. 1) you must log water by 8.45 ounces and can’t change that. 2) if you choose one of their diets, you can’t edit the calories. I was on the 5:2 diet and it had me eating 1600 calories on non-fasting days. I’m doing 1400 calories, but there’s no way for me to change that. And none of their plans allow for different calorie goals for different days. 3) app crashes a couple times a day and I have to log out and log back in. 4) the food insights are very limited. They tell me my nutrients are imbalanced if my meal is a couple grams over/under with one macro. 5) most scanned foods come out with incorrect information. 6) can’t move foods from meal to meal or day to day. 7) doesn’t show you the foods you eat regularly, have scanned recently, or generally prefer over others. Even more issues, but this review is getting to long.

Problem is, more than half the time I go to search a food to add it to my meal or create a recipe, the search turns up blank. There’s no error message, just no results.

My main issue is with adding foods for the next day. I often meal prep and input my food the day before so I can plan for the day ahead at work. However, many times I think I am putting in the food for the next day but the app adds the food to the current day instead. It happens over and over again and it takes me twice as long as it should to meal prep. I really hope this can be fixed or an option is added which allows you to change the day and/or meal on the food itself (the weight watchers app allows this).","We apologize for the issue you are experiencing.

I will say though I’m a little surprised there is no paleo option and it feels super focused on Keto. I’m paleo based, so while I wanted to try out the plan choices, I just stuck with the classic because they aren’t close enough. With options in recipes too, if they could add in an avoiding soy section, I’m sure a good portion of their users would appreciate it. I also wish I could customize the water tracker since I drink two 40 oz hydroflasks of water a day and it doesn’t really let me accurately track that. And also the macro counter would let me input my macro goal since it was over 100% according to the app.. I’m in a bulking stage, so it was a little frustrating having to adjust it just to track in the app. Overall though I still like it better than MFP.",Thanks for the feedback!

It’s very appealing and simple to use and i love the personalized diet plans which are the only positives it has over the other app I am comparing it to. In terms of everything else, I truly prefer MyFitnessPal. I hate the fact you can’t multi add foods when adding your meals for the day. The most irritating thing about this app is the lack of consistency/accuracy when tracking foods. It seems like most of the foods in this app aren’t verified and are completely based off of users creations. MyFitnessPal adds a healthy mix of both verified foods and user added meals. For example, I had Chipotle for dinner and I wish I could be able to choose ingredients with verified nutritional facts from the restaurant. Also, it’s unhealthy and irritating to be told to update your weight every single day. I did pay for the premium plan and so when that is over I’m heading back over to a MyFitnessPal.",Thank you for rating our app and sorry to hear that you are not satisfied!

For a number of months I was in a bad relationship with food—I was a binger and a restricter. This app helped me overcome this so quickly. What's different about this app from others is that looks much more in-depth than most free nutrition apps. I recommend the subscription for the whole experience, but even without it, it's very helpful. I am now numerous weeks clean from binging because this app gives many more notes. It informs you for approximately how many calories you should be eating per meal, the balance of macros, and the nutrition/rating of food. It even gives you a complete rating for your meals and day! I've tried MyFitnessPal, but it never really gave as much info as this app. It really is a helpful app, and I completely recommend it!",
75,5,2021-01-28T03:32:02.000Z,Velma White,Less data but more useful than other apps,"I’ve tried all the big names in calorie tracking but this is the only app that actually encourages a healthy relationship with food, in my experience. With LifeSum, you get high-level overviews of what you’re eating along with easy, actionable ways to improve your diet. By contrast, with MFP and Cronometer, I would often get so caught up in the minute details that I wouldn’t know what to change in my diet. LifeSum strikes a much better balance of giving the details most people need without overwhelming you with data. I highly recommend LifeSum if you’re someone who gets obsessive when using other apps because I’ve found it to be much gentler on my mental health (although please talk to a doctor if you have a history of disordered eating because any kind of calorie counting can be touchy)",
76,5,2020-01-13T16:34:17.000Z,1Tina14,Learning how to use this is key!,"At first I gave this app a bad review because I honestly wasn’t informed about how to use it. I was having difficulty adding my own items and macro information and I thought you couldn’t. After getting some help, this app is seriously the best! All you have to do is scan a barcode and bam, all the info is in there and you can easily track what you’re eating and your macros. It’s also extremely easy to add your own items if they aren’t in the system, or if it’s a home cooked meal you made. I highly recommend this app! I’m trying to lose weight in the new year, and this has really opened my eyes to how much fat and sugar and crap I was eating that I thought was healthy. This easily allows me to immediately see and track the nutritional value of what I’m putting into my body. I love it!","Amazing! Thank you Tina, that is music to our ears!

I really enjoy the looks of it, how fast it feels to log food and create meals. I have been eating keto, so I need my carbs to be low. You have the option of tracking net carbs, but sadly the data is not being processed correctly. For example any keto eater knows an avocado has a low amount of net carbs. about 4 per avocado. this app logs it as 17. it does not minus the fiber despite me confirming that I am tracking NET carbs. :/ so I cannot track my food. chia seeds it says a huge number of carbs. it does not minus the fiber. so basically if you need to know your true macros then this database is not so good. I redownloaded carb manager app today and wow the avocado has less than 4 grams net carbs. now I know I can eat it and not worry. and chia seeds is accurate on that app (carb manager app) too so I recommend switching to a better app and for the makers of this one to fix the data so it is not only an app with good looks. thank you.",We are sorry to hear this!

It’s very motivational and clicking on the water icons to report your hydration instantly gives a feeling of satisfaction. You can take pics of food to help you figure out calorie content. My only complaint is that the search feature is very lacking. It can be difficult to find what you are in the apps recorded selection of food. This makes the barcode feature important but so many things have not been scanned by other users that you often have to stop and take time to fill out the information for a “new” item of food yourself. This issue will go away when more people start using the app however. I found this app when apple recommended it on its health app.,"Thanks for your review!

I’m using it to evaluate what food I intake, the nutritional content of those foods, and how I can eventually make better choices. HOWEVER, if you are expecting to use Apple’s Health app to sync data from Lifesum (which the app claims to do), then skip it. While Lifesum does record and sync data to Health, its consistency is not reliable at all. Data may sync to the Health app for a couple of days, but for some reason, it will skip other days entirely. But more annoyingly, on days that it decide to sync data, it will sometime not sync every category which you have selected (i.e. water intake, sodium, sugar, etc.). Additionally, the app will sometimes glitch and erase data which you have recorded INSIDE of the app itself.

As long as you have a good scale and measuring cups you’ll be able to get a pretty accurate calorie count.

That’s fine, I don’t rely on those. My only major issue is that it doesn’t show calories burned while sleeping, sitting, etc from my Fitbit in the calories burned section, it adds them to “calories left” so I have to switch between apps to figure out my caloric deficit. Also, I can’t manually add workouts to increase my life score because it will add calories that I didn’t actually burn, so I guess I have to ignore the life score as well.

Unlike MyFitnessPal, which is the easiest food logging I’ve ever done, Lifesum is not only difficult in finding the food you’re trying to log (they don’t have the database that MFP has), but the serving sizes and entering the amount you’re eating is more often in grams instead of cups or the MUCH easier options on MyFitnessPal. A lot of the nutrition information is also wrong, meaning that I have toggle with the “amount” of food that I ate in order to get the calorie count correct. I also don’t love the often negative feedback that pops up if you occasionally eat something that’s non-nutritious. Because of this, I’ll likely be canceling my subscription at the end of the 3 months and looking back at MyFitnessPal.",Our product team is collecting all user suggestions directly here: http://lifesum.uservoice.com/forums/274566-feedback-ideas/filters/top

Got suckered into the 3 month subscription by all of these false reviews (or perhaps completely clueless people). It allows you to scan items and just move along to add them to your food tracking. However serving sizes are wrong, calories wrong, sugars, proteins, fats—everything. It’s different things for different items but when you look it over there is always something that is off. You literally need to sit there and go through every item even serving size, if it is tsp or tbsp to make sure the scanned item is right. I Deleted the app. I’ll be asking for my money back but this trash app and it’s lazy developers will probably tell me I can’t..just like they can’t get the correct nutritional info off a label.

Its integration with other apps like mySugar is a great idea, but it’s limited in some ways. 1) The inability to make necessary adjustments to information such as meal time. This is an unnecessary constraint on a paid app. I use lifesum to track and plan my meals along with my insulin intake, and this restriction on specifying meal times makes much of my data charts worthless. 2) When exporting the carb counts to other apps, it automatically excludes carbs that it has not verified, even if I have entered the numbers myself. There should at least be the option to include all data. 3) The app is often buggy. It crashes upon opening, and food input sometimes simply doesn’t work. Clicking to add an item results in a blank field that then disappears. A paid app should not have these problems.","We apologize for the issue you are experiencing.

This app is great for tracking and recommending certain things for my goal weight. However, when I first logged my morning fatty coffee as my breakfast, it gave me the “okay” symbol. I don’t pay for premium, but it seems to me that the picture of the fruit and bread are recommended as a “happy face”. As someone who is going to school for nutrition and has a few friends and family who have tested all sorts of things; with different weights, metabolisms, and health, we all can agree that carbs and even protein are not good for us in the least by not raising our insulin too much. I’m not keto, but I have everything in moderation. So I think that this should be updated or have more research put into it other than what the government or food industry thinks or portrays as “healthy”.","Many thanks for your review!

Contacted support for each of these with a wait time of over a WEEK for initial response each, and the responses weren’t helpful. The food database is lacking (still new I guess compared to my fitness) - A lot of the items are way off on accurate nutrition, and it allows you to flag them - had to flag a lot. The barcode scan works pretty well. The app does look and feel nice. But it doesn’t come close to Fitness Pal food database and functionality and lack of issues... canceled subscription for this and renewed my fitness pal membership - works flawlessly now.

First, the recommended daily meal plan in the keto burn have more carbs and or protein or calories than i need, so if i go with the recommended meals i would be exceeding my limits of carbs or protein, the recipes are great i like them but they don’t suit my plan. I mean i can choose only one and plan the rest of the meals of the day myself. Second, sometimes when i log food it counts more carbs/protein/calories then i have to close the app and open it again or delete the food and re-log it again.

It has reset my updated weight over and over again making it impossible to keep track. The app deletes food you’ve already logged for the day so that you have to keep adding it.

I do a lot of cooking and have used calorie counting apps before that let you add all of the ingredients to a custom dish or recipe along with how many serving that you prepared and calculates the calories that you consumed per serving. I haven’t seen this feature on this app so I just enter the calories per serving as a custom item but it doesn’t include any of the nutritional information.

This looked like a winner at first, it has a great layout and design. But there are features that require membership when they should be basic. The two biggies are 1. No daily nutritional information (I have potassium issues and I need to see that info) and 2. You can’t modify your daily intake (macros) based on your needs/desire without paying for Premium. For instance, it locks you into a “Classic Plan” that has macros and a calorie count that doesn’t fit with my current lifestyle and I can’t adjust them because it’s locked into a membership. With most other apps, including MyFitnessPal, these options are both included for free and pretty basic features. This app is basically a pretty calorie tracker without Membership.

My goal with Lifesum is to help me eat more, since I under eat a lot. While my under eating problems have been getting better since using Lifesum, there is one bug that kinda annoys me. Whenever I log a meal, it says that it is a few calories under, which is a really helpful aspect of this app. Sometimes, this feature bugs out, and gives the incorrect number of calories under. For example, if I log 200 calories of food, it will say that I am 200 calories under the minimum goal, which isn't true.

However, it needs a lot of work, especially the recipe function.  First, I found a lot of mistakes in the database, too few/many calories etc, and no way to report errors, unlike MFP.   Next, the recipe function keeps making the app crash and when I finally get a recipe entered, there is no way to edit it later.  For instance, you use a different brand a cheese the next time you make it, you can’t correct the calories/nutrition. Next, there is no website availability so you have to enter recipes in the app and personally, I can type much faster in a keyboard than a mobile device.  Last, but not least, there is no recipe import function so you do HAVE to enter each ingredient and instructions by hand, unlike MFP.  So while MFP may not have the glitzy, cutesy presentation, it is HANDS DOWN a much more functional app even without paying for their premium membership.","Hi there, we are sorry to hear that you feel this way but thank you for your feedback!

130,1,2018-02-24T18:56:50.000Z,emztuck,Useless compared to my fitness pal,"I started using this app because I thought the interface was more aesthetically pleasing than my fitness pal. I was so excited that I even bought the yearly subscription. After a day I regretted it. The food database is incomplete and not accurate. For example I was tracking for a few days and was wondering why it said my fats were so high...it said a serving of grilled chicken breast had 20 grams of fat.....the scanner doesn’t work either so you’re out of luck if you can’t find. The “rating” gets irritating as well. If you’re trying to center your carbs around when you workout it’ll constantly tell you that you’re off track because your macro distribution. Would also like to see an app that has the option of Meal 1, Meal 2, Meal 3, Meal 4, Meal 5 etc. rather than breakfast lunch dinner snack. Will be going back to my fitness pal. I just wish I hadn’t spent 50 dollars on a year subscription (which adds near no value to the app)","We are very sorry that you feel that way! If you prefer a refund, please contact us directly. We would also appreciate if you could send us some details abut the barcode scanner issue so we can start investigate. Thank you very much!"

There seemed to be an overly heavy emphasis on fad diets, but give the people what they want, right?","The verified foods are from several food databases: the USDA, food items from Livsmedelsverket in Sweden, from the UK Food Standards Agency and the BLS from Germany."
134,2,2018-12-19T18:06:13.000Z,Sgabel,Unreliable Diet Information & Poor Functionally,"The app itself has a very nice layout. However the functionality seems to be very wonky. For example, one day it says my calorie intake should be1650, the next day it say it should be 500. Not sure what to make of this. Based off two other apps I’ve tried, my goal intake is around 1250 calories. The other thing I noticed was for the “easy” Keto Diet, it was showing 80% carbs, 5% fat and 15% protein. Anyone familiar with the Keto Diet knows this is incorrect. Finally, one feature I liked was the 3 week weight loss plan that would show menus for the week. The day after I paid for the premium version, this feature was no where to be found. So far I have found this app to be very confusing and not at all accurate with the information it is supposed to track which is diet. Carb Manager is great for those focused on the Keto Diet and MyFitnessPal for all other diets.","Thank you for rating our app and for your feedback. We are sorry to hear that you find our app confusing! The  3 week weight loss plan requires specific settings in order to be available to you https://bit.ly/2A5T6Co.

This app doesn’t have a way to acknowledge this and therefore their “tips” about nutrient recommendations are off, since they’re counting on me eating three meals a day and not just two. I wish this was an option.","Thank you very much for your valuable feedback, we really appreciate it and will make sure to send it through to the team in charge! Thank you!"

This is one of many tracking apps I’ve used before, but this is the first I loved so much that I paid for the premium version. I love the idea of the plans, BUT, I so, so wish I could swap out a single ingredient in each recipe. I follow a vegan diet, but the plan offered for vegans is very limited. Instead, I like to follow other plans, but swap out proteins or cheeses for vegan options. I would LOVE to see an option where I can go into each recipe and swap these out rather than having to fill in the whole recipe myself just because of one substitution. This would also help when making sure I’m getting as much protein/calories as the meat option would have. Please add this feature; it would help the app become more vegan-friendly!",
137,5,2021-01-08T16:06:18.000Z,I don't know...Username?,Overall Such a Great App!,"I really enjoy this app! I initially downloaded it to help count macros because I am vegetarian and sometimes struggle to ensure I get enough protein every day. This app helps keep my protein intake (and fat and carbs) top of mind. One thing I wish I saw more was I take of other key nutrients - like fruits and veggies, which currently are just counted for carb intake. Since all carbs aren’t created equal, it would be helpful if carbs such as breads and pasta were differentiated from sweet potatoes and greens, for instance. But, a great thing it does do is account for added and naturally occurring sugars, so that helps a bit with fruit sugar vs pasta, packaged goods, etc. I also love the barcode scan function. All in all, I plan to use this app for a long time. Good work!",Thank you so very much for your positive feedback! We are very happy to read that you are satisfied! We will forward it to the responsible team for their knowledge.
138,1,2021-06-26T05:17:41.000Z,Caligrl24,Very disappointed,"I am so beyond sick of fighting with this app. If you care anything about tracking your macros correctly- go with myfitnesspal. I’m frustrated that I upgraded to premium only to hate this app so much, I dread using it. Everything I scan- has the wrong info and often times the barcode is associated with the wrong food item. So I edit each time, carefully putting in the exact info off the food packaging, only to have it tell me calories etc are wrong and not allow me to save it! Why bother?  I also hate that it won’t allow me to track other things, like vitamin content- except for potassium. Also a joke that it won’t allow you to remove food items you create, or most of all, edit them. Which is exactly why you see so many duplicate items created by ppl on here. I know I sometimes change my recipes up, so why not allow me to change it on here?  This app has been around too long to be this dysfunctional.","We are very sorry to hear that you have had a bad experience with our app and we appreciate your feedback. It is absolutely possible to edit and remove your created items - you can do this by entering the item through Favorites, not your Diary.

139,2,2021-03-03T22:01:21.000Z,Rosaa,Beautiful app but for targeted users only,"Hello, I have been a premium (paying) user of this app, but I had to cancel my membership. It’s a  beautiful user interface, which was the initial appeal for me as a user. However, without the ability to access simple data from my food intake, this app is not as useful as I would hope for it to be when tracking more than just macros. Calcium, magnesium, and so many other minerals that should be easily imported on the developer side (I am familiar with development), but somehow, even with a user forum requesting such simple tracking, and for years now, this data is not available to users. The alternative for tracking not just macros but the various minerals we need to survive and thrive is My Fitness Pal, which is free, for my purposes at least. I will happily return as a user when these simple yet essential pieces of data are shared and easily accessible as well.",We are very sorry to hear that you feel that way! We will make sure your feedback reaches the responsible teams.
140,4,2018-01-18T19:17:16.000Z,Gymgoer4813,Love it- but a few places for improvement,"The app is beautiful - which may be shallow but the design has certainly made me want to engage with the app far more than other food tracking apps I’ve used before. The reminders and prompts are helpful and motivating, and Lifesum offers a lot of easy-to-select plans (keto, 5:2) that I was interested in. I’ve paid for the 6 month subscription and am using the 5:2 plan. However, the food database to search from is far more spotty than Myfitnesspal and I’m putting most of my food in manually, and I am unable to move around my fast days throughout the week to account for my schedule, which causes some really discouraging feedback from the app when I’m either blowing my fast day calories or way under eating on a non-fast day.",Thank you very much for your feedback!

It’s hard because I work overnights and I log my dinners as breakfast and so on but it does help me maintain accountability of my food.  I like being able to find the foods I eat from popular restaurants to foods I prepare at home.  My favorite part of the app is being able to scan the barcode of the food I prepare and input my portions.",Thanks you so much for your positive feedback! We are very happy to read that you are satisfied!
142,4,2018-04-26T11:17:30.000Z,jadeycakes777,Overall amazing,Overall I think this app is amazing. I love the reminders and the weight tracker. I love the label scanning and entry capabilities. I love that you can track for different types of diets. Where I think this fell short is in the Keto diet tracking area. I track net carbs and yes it does track them to a certain degree. I occasionally buy low carb treats with three and under in the net carb department they are higher carbs but the majority of carbs are sugar alcohols which should be subtracted from the overall carbs just like fiber to get the net carb total. Like I said overall an amazing app just needs a little tweaking for net carbs to calculate correctly. I should add that I don’t buy apps but I did purchased this for the three month timeframe to try it out and will definitely be purchasing for the next time frame!,"Since we do not support sugar alcohol in our app our approach can differ a bit from other net carb calculators. There is no ""true and only"" way though."
143,3,2019-01-15T14:54:54.000Z,emmytobias,Wish the food entries were more accurate,"I like that this app allows me to make low carb/keto choices without judging me for consuming too much fat (*cough*MFP*cough*). I also like the premium feature of following a plan with recipes and guidance.  The app is beautiful in design. But I feel like if I’m going to pay for a food/diet journal app when there are sooo many free ones to pick from, the food entries need be accurate. I find myself fixing a lot of foods and barcodes in this database. And making a food a favorite should be right there on the nutrition facts breakdown—it’s not straightforward how to access recents or favorites. If I hadn’t paid for a 3mo subscription, I probably would have returned to another app by now for the convenience of a user-verified and more accurate database. A little more tweaking on the UX and accuracy of this app and it will be the bomb.","Thank you for your review - we truly appreciate you sharing your thoughts on our app and we have forwarded your feedback to the team!

This makes it difficult to track on dieting. I’ve had this app just 2-3 days of premium subscription and I feel it’s just not for me. The app isn’t really accurate on intake on calories. I’ve already paid for the subscription for a year, so it’s a waste of my money now which I paid for a year. The amount of water someone should take is helpful. Also, for someone to be using this, you have to have a decent income to buy most of the healthy products suggested to stay on track of diet plans. For myself I’m a student, so this is kind of difficult since I don’t make that much while going to school with a part time job.

It is by far my favorite calorie tracking app. I have one problem with the app and if you could fix it it would be great. Lifesum offers 4 places to submit meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and snacks. There are only 3 main meals that should be of large portions and a really small snack. However, I eat more meals but in smaller portions and the way of submitting your food when you eat like me gets difficult.

While there’s a lot to like about Lifesum, the app has many flaws. Mine has not synced with Apple Health since mid-December, despite several reinstallations as instructed by customer support. It displays my calorie count as the next day, for some reason. And the food search needs work. Entering something as standardized as a Chipotle order involves searching through dozens of entries for the same ingredient, all with different calorie counts. I’ve tried editing foods to correct them, but that doesn’t seem to work either. All in all, Lifesum is better than the My Fitness Pal app, but it needs work. If they can’t resolve these issues when my subscription is up, I will not be renewing.","Thanks for your review and sorry to hear that you've encountered some issue with our app!

I was excited for the vegetarian option but they don’t do nearly anything for it. The picture taking ability is always faulty and is not worth the time.

Also, at some point they lost my progress and said I had only lost 2 pounds, which was really disappointing to me. It was very helpful for me to look back on the chart going back many months to see the steady progress toward my goal.

The dilemma for myself and so many others is that I have such a restricted diet I don’t know if your app allows all my preferences. I am not signing up for anything without knowing what EXACTLY I am getting in return. $30 to hope that you can provide the recipes I can actually eat??? Pass. This hopefully works for many who do not have serious restrictions but for those that do you are asking us to throw our money on a very unlikely bet.","Hi there, that you for your feedback.

The benefits for paying $30+ a year aren’t normally enough to make me go premium, but I would just to support the work of the team building lifesum. The ONLY thing keeping me from upgrading is the weird payment system. It’s monthly but managed by where you upgraded (iTunes or website) and the only way to cancel is to take it up with Apple, or whoever handles the payment. If canceling a subscription with lifesum directly, it looks like you email them and hope they’ll come through on manually cancelling. It’s just not worth the potential headache later. I would rather pay a one-time fee than deal with a weird, fragmented subscription model.","Thank you for your positive review!

However articles and content posted by lifesum are geared towards females with almost all imagery being that of women and article titles like “Eat Like A Goddess”. Great health isn’t bias, but the sex of an individual will affect it. I assume this is why the customizable features within the app are available. That in conjunction with the unisex interface should be more of a reason to creat an app geared towards everyone to enjoy.

However, the functionality is where I feel Lifesum falls short. I was a loyal MyFitnessPal user for years and I decided to try Lifesum Premium to see if I liked it. The small library of food items and the difficulty through which food is logged proved to be too cumbersome for something that I KNOW can be easy, as it is through MyFitnessPal. The “Meal Plans” include eating 500 calories for 1 or 2 days a week... yikes. Every nutritionist will tell you that starving/fasting yourself is terrible for losing weight and your metabolism. The recipes are not worth premium, in my opinion. (Boiled eggs with mayonnaise as an example🤮) I tried Lifesum for about 2 weeks and I will sadly be going back to MyFitnessPal, even though I have 2 months left of Premium on this app.","Thanks for your feedback. We never recommend something that would not be health beneficiary, including the 5:2 diet that has 2 fasting days a week in the plan. Research has proved that a short fasting period has a positive impact to your health and that people who follow this lifestyle tend to lead longer lives. There are many other plans available to choose from if that is not your thing! Our food database is improving constantly. It is partly user-created and that results in some items having inaccurate nutritional values. We recommend that you either select items verified by us or, for items that you cannot find in our database, create custom items under Favorites. Find out more here: http://bit.ly/2CSyBYp."

As I was playing around with it for the first time I noticed that many of the features were locked and I need to buy premium in order to use them. Every time I saw something that I wanted to know or a feature I wanted to use, it was locked. Then I realized that without premium there is little the app can do. I think it would be nice to have a month or few week long free trial to test out premium before committing to paying for it, or something like that. Or, the app can just unlock some of the great features that made me download the app in the first place. For example, the camera to take a picture of my meal would save so much time!","We are charging for some of our features in order to cover our running expenses, which include a team of designers, developers and nutritionist and a total of over 60 employees.

After I read the reviews and contemplated paying for the $40 yearly subscription, I did. The app and platform itself is simple and aesthetically pleasing, therefore I felt this app would hold me accountable better than I could hold myself accountable. Although I didn’t log food every day and only used a couple recipes, the “update your weight” button kept me motivated to weigh myself everyday and think more consciously about my intake. I also enjoy that my watch activity connects to the platform, adjusting my goal caloric intake based on my plan. After 4 months I am down 50 pounds and I’m not done yet.

It’s just not worth that. I like the look of it, it’s not too difficult to navigate. But, every time I scan a food item, it is either not in the system and I have to add it, or the nutritional information or measurements are incorrect. (Sometimes the calories are correct but it says the standard serving is 1 cup instead of 1 tbsp, etc). I would say this is the case for 85% of foods that I add to my day and it gets so frustrating having to change everything. I wouldn’t mind having to add a new food or correct something every once in awhile, but I feel like it happens literally every day.  Even items from big companies like Quaker are not in the system sometimes. Pretty disappointing considering how much I paid.","Thank you for your feedback.

The recipes are VERY vague. Often with ingredients measured in “standard serving” or in grams. The ingredients lists are either odd or so short that I was constantly adding to the recipe to give it flavor. The instructions more or less just say “Cook food and eat it”. There’s no way to add a custom meal on the food tracker so tracking an actual meal you cooked is a huge pain. There are various diet plans to choose from but very little explanation on how to actually live within that plan. Also the meal plan itself is a pain to try and navigate in order to plan and meal prep. In short use this for a free tracker (it really is pretty) but don’t waste your time on the premium meal plans.,Our product team is collecting all user suggestions directly here: http://lifesum.uservoice.com/forums/274566-feedback-ideas/filters/top

It’s not easy to add your own, but try and try again, you’ll get it. And the recipes should let you see the nutritional value of each item, and maybe be able to delete items you aren’t going to use, but then you would find some of the issues with improper nutritional reporting. I’m have labels that claim there are no carbs, but items in the app assign them carbs. WTH. It’s been frustratingly, enough to test your resolve.

Even when searching for a recipe I made, there was nothing that popped up besides the few options on the explore page. If I want to make anything other than the recipes on the app itself I have to manually enter every single ingredient.

If I paused while tracking the meal to get more info and went back, the entire meal was gone, and I’d have to start from scratch. I had some issues tracking weight and trying to delete info I added on accident, which isn’t very helpful when tracking. Overall, I liked the look and idea but I wouldn’t recommend paying for this app until many bugs are fixed.","Thank you very much for your feedback, we appreciate it and have sent it through to the team in charge."

I’ve even lost 5 pounds just by being more motivated to eat healthy and exercise. The big difference for me is it rates the healthiness of foods, not just the calories. The app also nudges you if you eat too little, which I really appreciate! When I have an unhealthy day, Lifesum has good tips on how to improve, and congratulates you when you have a great day! I just wish you could turn on fruit/veggie/etc trackers without having to struggle in the Life Score first. Great app, WORTH the subscription!",Thank you very much for your feedback!

The food selections are limited. I find myself having to make things up or selecting an option from a source I’ve never heard of. Thus, throwing accuracy to the wind. Secondly, the diet feature is limited. You can only select from a few diets but you can’t customize your plans or mix them. The options offered are specific and do not cater to dietary restrictions. The helpful hints are catered toward a user who is following the diet perfectly and do not adjust based on actual consumption or input trends.

I only started doing this app at first because I had to go on the low iodine diet for testing. I just wanted to track what I was eating. I started loosing weight on the diet and decided since I was finally loosing weight I would continue using the app.  It shows me how many calories my body needs and if I eat something that’s not acceptable I get a sad face. I’m just three weeks in and weight 277.4 pounds. I’ve done several diets in the past! This isn’t a diet, this for me is a teaching tool of how to live a better in more healthier way.

I noticed today after putting a new recipe in that it added almost 5x the amount of net carbs that are actually in the recipe— using Lifesum’s “verified” number of each of the macros, it should have been around 2.8 net carbs.","Thank you for your feedback!

It knows 99% of things you can. If it doesn’t, you can easily just add the calories (which is all I care about). My one and only gripe about it is the water intake. I wish the water intake configuration was a little more customizable. Even though I’m an American, I prefer to use ml. As of right now you can only go by a 8 oz glass of water or a 16 oz bottle of water. A lot of people use refillable water bottles that typically like 24-64 oz. so no matter what you do, you can’t measure your water to the exact amount.",Thank you for your positive feedback and 5 star rating.

For me personally it didn’t work very well. It’s what triggered  me to an Ed way of eating.  I lost a ton of weight in a very unhealthy way. Leading my body to not function optionally. I started to ditch the app and educate myself on health and nutrition. Going towards a more “listening to my body” type of way. That truly helped me gain my weight back and get out of my ed ways. I’m not saying to not download this app. All I am saying is to please if you feel restricted, unhappy, and making food become a number. Then please do not get the app!

There are very limited food plans and not a lot of offered recipes. Also it is very difficult to receive a refund if you are unsatisfied. I tried to cancel about 10 min after i purchases after I realized it did not include what was promised, and was directed to Apple Support who will not refund (Lifesum hides behind the fact that they do not directly handle the payment platform). I have tried to use it anyways since I’m paying for 6 months (whether I like it or not) and now the app keeps crashing randomly when I try to view the plan section. Disappointing, not worth it for premium, might be useful if you stick to free but my fitness pal is just as good with a larger database.",We are awfully sorry for the inconvenience.

I just got out of a 3 month long stay in inpatient and residential ed treatment at 15 years old and am still in a partial hospitalization program. This app lets you set ridiculously low calorie limits and doesn’t fight you on them with more than a notification that the goal is too low. In addition it sets your original goal at 1200 cal which isn’t even enough to feed a person in a coma. We need at least 1400 per day to exist in a coma and at least 2000 per day to exist a normal life. It encourages people to eat way under the amount their body needs. If you want to lose weight please do NOT use this app. Restricting your calories will not work long term. Listen to your body. It knows what it needs. You don’t want to end up where I and many others are.,"We are very sorry to hear about your experience. Lifesum has been designed to help our users eat better.

But I’m pretty tired of my exercise not syncing from my Fitbit, or having exercise I’ve manually input just disappear. The app also changes my weight on its own accord. No, I did not lose weight or gain that weight....I clearly haven’t entered the amount it decides for that day. Sometimes it just reverts back to my starting weight for no reason at all. If you’re looking for an accurate graph for weight this is NOT the app you should be using. I’d be better off with a pen and paper. I’ve reported this issue many times, yet it still seems to be broken. Funny....my LoseIt app doesn’t do this....and neither does my FitBit app. It’s frustrating keeping food tracking in one app and weight tracking by in another.","Thank you so much for your feedback, we understand how frustrating this must be.

Net carbs is the only feature improvement during this time I've actually used. Fitbit exercise syncing gets worse and worse.

I don’t like that the app tells me what my calorie intake should be and doesn’t allow me to adjust it. I like that you can adjust the carbs/fats/protein ratio but ONLY AFTER purchasing a subscription and the ratio HAS to fit within the calories which are not accurate for me! Please allow users to adjust total calories and ratios based on our own goals.

If you put in all the effort to track your meals you really become more aware of what your eating and how many calories it is. The reason I only put 4 stars is because they give you a lot of pop ups for their plans you pay for and I was really just looking for something free and easy to help me feel more self confident. This app is totally free unless you chose to pay for one of the special plans which I don’t intend to do. I would say the free version is probably better then the paid plan.

The only things I am hoping are added are the ability to customize the water logging AND being able to log calories with the option to add the nutritional information. I eat a few meals that I have the nutritional information for, but I have to log the calories instead.

I got the 1 year subscription and hoped it would work for me. So far it hasn’t. I am trying to go keto to lose some weight and I am also vegetarian (not vegan, so not that restrictive) and when I looked for recipes to fit the bill they only had maybe 10 available. Granted I can look up recipes but I was hoping for more ease with this app. They also don’t have a plan ahead feature which means if I want to plan a meal in advance I have to go through and add it to my daily count and try to delete it after. I disappointed to say the least, never have I felt compelled to leave a review but this app is a waste of money.

Unfortunately, the calories gained/burned associated with different foods and activities are so wildly absurd that the app is unusable. No, I did not burn 1000 calories at my water aerobics class. If that were the case, all of the little old ladies there would be going into hypoglycemic shock. No, I did not burn 800 calories walking around the grocery store. No, I did not burn 160 calories from going on the elliptical for 10 minutes. The app also suffers from a mediocre and inaccurate food library, seemingly comprised mostly of user-inputted data.

However I do have a big problem with the “premium” content that you have to pay for.  Without paying for the premium, this app is just meh. It seems like every time there’s something that could potentially further help you, you have to pay premium for it. You see that they offer specific diet plans and all this great stuff but that’s only if you pay premium for it. If you aren’t willing to pay the price, then this app is basically just a calorie and exercise recorder. That’s my one issue with this app. If more things were available to those not paying, then I would’ve enjoyed this app more.","Thank you for your review!

Yet if you cook, there’s no means (certainly not an intuitive one) for putting your own recipes into the app. So if you make, for example, egg roll bowls (essentially the innards of an egg roll, but as a stir fry/salad without the shell), you have no practical means of just entering “4 oz golf egg roll bowl” based on a pre-entered recipe with its nutritional info. That makes the product useless as a food diary unless you totally rely on the lazy forms of food a good diet plan should encourage you to avoid. Disappointing. Will reconsider if you can explain (and make way more visible) a way for entering your own recipes. And if that’s a premium feature, it’s not obvious...it just says access to more of yours.","Thank you for  your feedback, we are sorry to hear that you feel this way.

I can’t believe I purchased the premium version based on other reviews, only to find out that it is so bad. The premium version has very limited functionality, and trying to enter real food is a battle that just isn’t worth fighting. It seems to think that all food comes from restaurants instead of my own kitchen. Too bad if you didn’t have a side of potatoes with that omelette. The app just decided that you did and you’re stuck with a food journal that isn’t representative of the actual food that you actually ate. And just try adjusting your macros to something you would want to track. The app pigeon holes you into one of a few predetermined meal plans and expects you to stick to that.  I am deleting the app even though I paid $30 for it.","We are sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with our app and we thank you for your feedback. Besides being able to find single items (not paired restaurant-style) in our database, you also have the possibility to create your own items/recipes/meals through Me > Favorites and track EXACTLY what you are consuming.

I use the barcode scanner to enter in tons of foods and I've also linked my Fitbit to keep track of my exercise. The only thing I can't STAND about this app is that there is no setting for net carbs on the meal/eating plans. On a low carb/keto diet, fiber is subtracted from total carbs to give you an idea of the number of grams of carbohydrate that are actually impacting your blood glucose levels (net carbs). Without net carbs, it shows that my daily carb intake is WAY over what it should be when almost half of that is fiber.

Quite frankly, it’s underwhelming and seems like it wants to be more like MyFitnessPal or Fitbit. However, its scanning function hardly works, and a lot of the information it does have is wrong or incomplete. It also does not track vitamins and minerals, which are really important, especially if you’re dieting. You also have limited control over what information you can input for a meal or recipe. I will say that I like the faces next to individual food items, but again, this is only effective if the information attached to the food item is correct.

I used it daily for months and it drove me insane that it constantly crashed. I should mention that I currently have an iPhone 8 so it’s not an issue with an old phone. I don’t mean once and then it would work if you opened it again. There are just periods where it doesn’t work at all and you can open it 20 ones in a row and it will just continue to instantly close. It is insanely frustrating. Once you’ve got some of your favorite foods in the history, it’s annoying to switch to another app. So my advice is not to invest in it at all. Go with my fitness pal.

It should also be noted there aren’t complications for all Apple Watch faces, if you have a favorite face make sure there is a complication for it.

Login with Apple gets a big thumbs up from me. Not sure about the canned eating plans - I’m not into ‘diets’, just want to track overall calories, maybe macro and fat/carb/protein balance so I started the ‘classic’ plan. At the end of the day the app yells at me for not eating enough, even though my body says I’ve had enough. Thought the vegetable tracker would understand that a salad counts as a vegetable and clock it accordingly - guess not. Must be a manual thing. I probably just need to use it for a while longer to get comfortable.","Thank you for choosing Lifesum and for rating us!

I found myself Googling how many calories were actually in foods - most of the time, MyFitnessPal was the first search result - and adding it manually.

It would be great to pick recipes from the app and turn them into a shopping list, or even the ability to import recipes from the web (via the share buttons in browsers), and have the ingredients auto-import into a meal plan with a shopping list.",Thank you for your feedback!

The meal plans are thought and valuable. The photo the food works surprisingly well too. However the app is buggy, crashes a good portion of my uses and sometimes the data gets munged but quickly fixed with a restart of the app. It probably deserves 2 stars, but I am hopeful the quality will improve, features will be added and the food database is cleaned up. I’m not sure I would spend the 40-50$/annual subscription. The $20 I spent on the “pleas come back” offer was a fair price for quality right now.",Thank you for your review and sorry to hear that you're encountering some issues with our app!

If users can’t use the barcode scanner, they can only enter calories without macros. It defeats the purpose of having any plan that tracks those, and makes the premium account kind of useless UNLESS you’re eating foods that are already in the database. Combing through customer discussion boards, this has been a requested feature since 2016. Clearly this customer concern hasn’t risen to the degree of import necessary to compel a design or architectural change at Lifesum in four years.

If I’ve purchased something made by a keto bakery and have the macros, why can’t I add this food? The only self add I see is the simple calorie add. I was forced to purchase the app in order to use the keto strict plan, and now it’s limiting me in how I can use it. Also, i don’t always have a barcode for my food. Some eggs are naked in a bowl and have no carbs. But when I take a photo, they show up as .9 carbs. This is a big deal when you can only have 20 carbs a day. Another annoying thing: I don’t have time to enter an entire recipe for food or meal and allow the app to determine the macros. I have a good idea based on what I can read for myself. Why can’t I just input it myself when need be? It’s very limiting and frustrating to be this expensive.","Thank you for your feedback.

I’ve been struggling with losing my last 10 lbs and although I eat healthy this app makes me pay more attention to the full picture tracking calories, fat, carbs & protein (plus some) for a more balanced meal/day. The only issue I’m having is that it crashes at least 5 times a day.

Absolutely not.,"Took the test to see which meal plan I should follow and my “nutritional advisor”, Lykke, told me “When you befriend your hunger, you can lose weight without actually changing your lifestyle”. My recommended meal plan was to eat what I want 5 days a week, and fast 2 days a week. Are you KIDDING ME?!?!? Please someone else agree with me that this is unhealthy both physically and mentally. I mean really??? A NUTRITIONAL ADVISOR is helping me meal plan by telling me NOT TO EAT FOR TWO DAYS. Outrageous. This type of “meal plan” is what encourages eating disorders. I pray this portion of the app can be removed in order to spare others from the damage it may potentially cause. I understand in limited circumstances the reason for a fast, but encouraging ongoing multi-day fasts is damaging in more ways than one. Thanks, but I will never “befriend my hunger”.",Thank you very much for your feedback! We are very sorry that you se the 5:2 option that way.

I have recommended this app to so many people but I’ll have to stop if you can’t even adjust your macros to your lifestyle. Looks like they’re getting rid of workout tracking too which is sad. Please bring those 2 things back to all users.

It gets the workout calories right but the step calories are completely off - first of all, they double count between steps and workouts (when I go for a run, the app adds calories for the workout and then for all of the steps); second, the amount of calories per step is huuuuge.

The search mechanism is busted. You removed the brand name from the search which is pretty important. When someone tries to search something there is no longer the tab “recent” and “favorites”. I lost 2 days from my diary, I have to scroll past all my favorite items to get to my meals. Really I dont know who thought that would be good, but UX is falling behind.

What the cost actually unlocked was a few specialized diets that largely were all comprised of the exact same meals. In addition the meal planning feature had a small handful of meals available with no real flexibility. For example - you can’t even block a day out. I downloaded today with the intention of shopping and starting at the end of the work week and yet I was required to have a meal selected and added to the shopping list for days I didn’t need.

They also automatically auto renew at the end of user package you subscribe. So if you sign up for a month or a year, at the end of that period you will be automatically renewed and charged again. I tried to cancel through Apple but as this is a 3rd party developer, Apple doesn’t have the ability to do anything. And when I went to the Lifesum website and emailed customer support, I received an automated email about 3 days later informing me to follow the unsubscribe link through the app!!!!

I started taking care of my nutrition a couple years ago, and this app that I found a month ago has been a really helpful tool when tracking my meals and calories. I strongly recommend it! Reason I give it 4 stars is that it doesn't have monthly plans. I know many apps manage yearly subscriptions but that's something I don't like. I prefer to pay a month and if I like it I keep it. This one has a 3-month but the price ends up being too high and close to a yearly payment. It's good even for its free features, but if it had a month by month I would pay for it.",

The premise is great, the calorie counter/home page is super useful, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to use the plans and the calorie count at the same time. Maybe I’m just missing a major step, but tracking food from the plan doesn’t automatically add it to the calorie counter so I’m spending way too much time importing nutritional info-which is exactly why I paid for the premium, thinking I could just use their meal plans.... no such luck.

However, I’m only allowed 20 carbs a day and I just ate the breakfast on the plan without looking at the nutritional info, and it was 16.5 carbs. Looking at the rest of the day, my carbs are WAY over the limit, which will put me out of ketosis. So I’m either going to have to go hungry or get knocked out.

However I’ve noticed that a lot of the recipes you can look through outside of the ones designated for your plan don’t actually follow the plan you chose. For example, the keto plan. It suggests you stay under 20 net carbs per day, which is fine! But then you go look at the “keto recipes” and they have recipes that are 15 net carbs in one serving alone.

The app is easy to use and it encourages you to stay within your calorie limit and gives a good breakdown of the nutritional value of the foods you’re eating. I also like the ability to enter almost any exercise you’re doing and have those calories added to your daily allowance. The water reminders are also a definite aid for me.

I’m on day 3 and am very frustrated with the recipes...the Carrot Soup with Garlic Creme Fraiche omits most of the instructions and I had to search through the Recipes tab to find something similar (but not exact). The measurements are in an odd combination of deciliter, cups, grams, and the occasional teaspoon or tablespoon, all in one recipe. The Turkey Spinach Omelette and Quinoa with Eggplant and Spinach are terrible recipes...they do not include anything in the way of spice or flavoring and are inedible as-is. Tracking plan meals is buggy - sometimes they do not show up in your calorie count and sometimes they do. The recipe for the Crispbread with Apple, Cream Cheese, and Walnuts tracks as 2298 calories and there is no way to fix the calorie count.

Without premium you can get an accurate measure of how many calories you should be eating and how many you do eat. It also keeps track of the amount of water you drink. The problem is if you can afford premium the app really doesn't do much for you. You cant get help with dieting, personalized insights, recipes, or any suggestions on what you should be eating.

You don’t have the ability to 1. Create your own recipes 2. Create a grocery list. With this app you HAVE to pick from a very limited number of diets in order for it to generate a meal plan (I only had the option of 2 diets) and you can’t add anything in addition to what the app gives you. It seems kind of like a waste unless you only want to eat exactly what it gives you in there.

The thing is I already paid for it and I tried using the special features but there’s nothing there that’s really accessible! All of the recipes call for expensive and unattainable (only available at whole foods) ingredients. I didn’t think it was helpful in suggesting where I needed to go and what I needed to do.

I am on the Keto strict diet and from the research and endless videos I’ve seen I should be counting net carbs not total carbs. Unfortunately this app counts total carb and not net carbs so that really limits me on my eating. I would love it if it keep track of my net carbs instead of total.

I LOVE the barcode scan to make tracking food way faster. The carb/protein/fat tracker is also a nice bonus. My only complaint is that it seems to be operating for someone who has a traditional 9-5 life. So when I get up at 10:30 AM it’s telling me that it’s almost time for lunch, it gives me a bad score when I haven’t eaten enough by 7, and stops notifying me and updating by like 9 PM. Rather annoying for a night owl like me, but it’s an easy thing to ignore. Overall I’m very pleased!",Many thanks for your positive review!

The only thing I wish was different would be the ability to enter foods specifically to what you ate, (i.e. I made a breakfast sandwich this morning that was a plain bagel, provolone, chicken and egg, but they didn’t have anything similar to choose from for my breakfast so I had to choose a chick-fil-a sandwich instead) rather than making you choose from pre-made selections, it would allow your calorie intake to be more accurate and help with your program (whichever you choose to do).",Thank you for your feedback!

However the app is glitchy and some of the functionality really annoying.  This morning I logged my breakfast with a picture.  It only correctly identified the red pepper (it was eggs with veggies, banana, peanut butter and English muffin).  So after adding the rest, it didn’t actually save the picture.

I have gained the weight back and tried using this app to maintain my weight. Normally females should have around 1,600-2,000 calories. The app was recommending for me to have only 457 calories a day! And as I continue using the app it recommends I only eat 328 calories!!! Calories are energy and that’s what your body needs. To eat less than 1,000 a day is not healthy. For the app to even recommend that is not ok. While it is good to eat healthy like fruits and vegetables, carbs and protein should be included. The app recommended me to only eat 41 grams of carbs a day. The app is promoting orthorexia and should be reevaluated.",Thank you very much for your feedback.

I want to switch over from MyFitnessPal to Lifesum, I really do! But MyFitnessPals ability to scan bar codes to input food, to manually put in the calories and nutritional information of a food and to save my own collections of meals is really what’s keeping me from using Lifesum. Also the database of food, restaurant menus on MyFitnessPal is way WAY bigger, accurate and better than Lifesum.

I really love the details it shows you from what you eat, my only issue with this is that I wish there was a paleo plan but I can also see a difficulty in that existing since paleo doesn’t track calories nor does paleo track macros. I guess it would just be an open nutrition count. It would be cool if they added some hints or guiding info on how to work on the paleo diet for others to follow as beginners.",Thank you for your review!

Having actual metrics available at any time is enlightening.  It’s easy to think I’m doing well with my diet, but Lifesum provides me with real data.

No problem, just a few bucks a month. Issue is now that I’ve paid for the premium membership the app keeps telling me I need to upgrade, but when I go to upgrade it tells me I already have. I have tried signing out and signing back in and even deleting the app and then re downloading. Neither of these seemed to help. I have also reached out to the developer and not received any response. Seems like it would be a nice one stop app to monitor calorie intake and physical activity, if it would just work.","We apologize for the issue you are experiencing.

Pay close attention... you scan a package of sliced pepperoni (for example) the package gives the nutritional facts, per serving. A serving of pepperoni in this instance is 4 slices. The application however extrapolates that that is the nutritional information per slice. It has done this with every single thing I have scanned. The data is the same for what is already cached in the application. Which is why I have been scanning my food, because it’s wrong. The application itself looks great.

Unlike other trackers it wants you to create healthy habits that will last long after you’ve lost or gained the weight you want. Other food tracking apps are ugly and too complicated while Lifesum is a gorgeous app that simplifies healthy eating. The only thing I don’t like about the app is the frowny faces it gives when you eat “bad” foods.

I’ll log my weight and then it’ll be different next time. This happens on all sorts of areas, even my birthdate has changed on me, and I continually need to check back on things and correct. And it’s a little weird. It measures water intake by 8.45 ounces, and it’s hard to enter the exact the nutrition facts, like it’ll recalculate my calories to be 59 rather than 60. Also, I can’t set my own nutrition goals or macros, I have to use one of their five preset plans. It’s just odd. Also, huge annoyance is that it doesn’t sync steps with Fitbit, only workouts!

I thought there would be more plans with the paid version, but turns out there are maybe 10 tops and I wouldn’t call them “plans” per se, more like “general themes without much personalization”.  I like the Lifesum UI but when I’m without a barcode and have to use the search bar to enter food, I end up with lots of odd, misspelled options with ENTIRELY different calorie counts!  One of the first options that came up for olive oil said there were 58 calories in a TB, roughly half the actual amount.

Like it’s great to be able to track on a given day that my mood and/or energy felt high, and also I did or didn’t have a stomach ache.

403,5,2019-04-02T11:25:02.000Z,PaulCassso,A Great way to be healthy,This app makes recording your meals and tracking your calories so much easier than any other app that I’ve ever used. Plus all of the feedback that you get when you’re recording your meals helps you to know what’s better for you and worse for you all without forcing you to be on a meal plan. Premium is definitely worth it if you’re trying to get your health on track plus they give you a discount for like 30% on your first year subscription.,Thanks you so much for your positive feedback! We are very happy to read that you are satisfied!

Visually interesting enough to provide a sense of accomplishment when being healthier and already feeling the results in the first week. Would love for the option to see why certain foods are unhealthy for my diet to be a “free” addition to the app, but understandably an app needs paying customers to keep running without huge advertisements plastered over it.",Thanks a lot for leaving your feedback! We are glad to read that you are satisfied with your Lifesum experience.

In just 10 weeks, I went from 249lbs to 217lbs, my waist went from a 47 to a 44, and my BMI went from 44.1 to 38.4! I did this with just the free version. This app kept me accountable and is beautifully designed. Watching my charts change and been so motivating! I coupled this app with the Fitness22 Workout app to achieve my results and I couldn’t be more grateful! Thank you so much for such a fantastic app! I recommend this to everyone!!",We are super excited to hear that Lifesum has helped you improve your lifestyle! Thank you for sharing your positive thoughts on our app!

I wish it persisted data a little better. Every few days it will reset my weight back to my starting weight and log that instead of my input, which has gotten annoying. It also loses connection to the Fitbit every other day and I have to go connect it all back up again. I’m sadly searching for a new app even though I love this one the most.

But the user experience is made awful by the clunkiness of its execution. Surprisingly often I'm unable to scroll past my lunch entry when I attempt to input dinner. Or looking at past days I'm unable to scroll. Syncing is also hit or miss. Overall, using this app is sort of tragic since it's so close to a seamless experience but they haven't yet taken the extra step to make it as reliable as it could be. I'm hoping they can update this app to be as seamless as other cloud-reliant services.",We are sorry to hear that you are having a bad experience with our app and we thank you for your feedback!

408,2,2019-06-20T19:08:14.000Z,Whooperss,Can’t customize a “plan” for vegetarian or Vegan,"Unfortunately even though this app is lovely and easy to use, it’s hard to customize vegan meal plans with limited choices. You are forced it’s choices for dieting but when you click vegan there are about 3-4 choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner qhich gets boring fast. Additionally adjusting your cal goal is also nearly impossible, while it’s under settings, it doesn’t actually adjust no matter how many times you save so it’s hard to track how on target you are. Lastly you can’t change your macros by day so you are stuck to whatever macros you enter as the target regardless if you likely have variations by day. 😞",Thank you very much for your feedback!

I like all the features and how easy it is to use , I also like how you can add water and have veggie / fruit / sea food goals as well for the day / week !! The only thing I don't like about this app is that the water tracking feature only allows you to track two different amounts , this makes it very hard to add in water when your water bottle / cups aren't that amount . it would be great and would really help the apps likeability if the delevopers could make it so you can add your own custom amounts to their liking !",

There’s not a coach on line to give you ideas on what to do, where to cut back exercise. For the price I was expecting more.

However, the units listed for many foods when trying to add to the food diary are often confusing or just wrong. You might see something listed as “one serving” or listed as 190 calories when you know it to be 100 calories. I believe it is possible to edit these, but I do not always know the number of calories in my foods or I’m in a hurry. This is not a great app if you’re often on the go, because you may have to double check the number of calories using other sources.","Thank you very much for your feedback!

I enjoy the way it recommends meals and allows you some options. So far my only question is whether or not there will be anymore plans added in the near future. Personally I’m looking 16/8 hr fasting option. The last option that would really advance my experience would be if there was an option to enter your personal MACROS to try and follow. Are either of these options available in the near future? Thank you.","Thank you for your review! If you use the Classic plan, you can set your own calorie allowance and macros.

I don’t know why they would lock that SINGLE feature. It says pay for premium to be able to edit your macros but when you do you can only change your proteins and fat. I’m so annoyed with this because it’s saying I need to intake way too many carbs for my ketogenic diet. Please PLEASE unlock this feature ASAP, this feature alone might make me cancel my newly paid subscription.","Thank you very much for your review and for sharing your thoughts on our app! It is possible to customise your calorie allowance and all macros when following the Classic diet plan. The percentage for the carbs is locked in the keto plans as we otherwise do not have any technical solution to allot matching recipes. You can now choose between three plans (20, 50 or 100 grams of carbs) and you are able to manually change fat and protein. Good luck with reaching your goal!"

Literally it does not get any easier, and this is all free! I love that they made a widget, I put it on my Home Screen next to my activity widget and I can quickly see where I’m at for the day.

I don’t feel hungry all day.  The food is delicious. The step by step cooking is wonderful. (JUST ONE MAJOR COMPLAINT.)>>>>>I have to fit all the ingredients in a measuring cup. That is extra work.

It would be wonderful if there was a net carbs feature for ketogenic diets. I have been under eating carbs because I assumed the app took the fiber out of the carb count but as it turns out it doesn’t. Also, I have scanned certain foods like an avocado, and my avocados get a bad rating but other avocados are okay. Is this because some foods do have their fiber subtracted out of their carbs? Either way... confusing.",The good news first: we are working on a net carbs implementation!
423,5,2018-03-22T23:27:04.000Z,elysasms,Glad net carbs have been added! Still a few kinks,"So glad to see they’ve added Net Carbs as an option to help those of us on a keto diet. I noticed the “Nutrient Distribution” still reflects the Total Carbs not net carbs though, so it shows as “Imbalanced” nutrient distribution, and that your food is high in carbs even if it’s low in carbs, which is confusing...This also means some of the meals i eat inaccurately show a frowny face when they’re actually very balanced. Hopefully the developers fix this...adding net carbs is definitely a good start!",Please be so kind and contact us with examples at contact@lifesum.com so we can have a look at this!

My only criticism is that it’s hard for me in the US to gauge what I’m eating because almost everything is measured using the metric system. I wish there was a capability to toggle between different measurement units. I also noticed that some of the calorie information that comes up when scanning the barcode doesn’t always match up. These are small things, but occasionally annoying.","Thank you for your review! Our food database is partly user-created and that results in some items having inaccurate nutritional values.

Needs a little improvement,Firstly I’d like to comment on the aesthetic of this application it’s calming and smoothly runs on my iPhone however adding food seems a little hard because adding specific portions that aren’t based on serving size requires decimal conversions that off the top of my head I don’t know making logging the food a much more tedious task than using the app lose it however i still prefer this over the other so i will continue using Lifesum.,Thank you very much for your feedback!

That’s what drew me in, but it is the glitchiest thing on earth. I’m a customer who recently upgraded to premium in order to fully access all the features of the app. I recently noticed that this app always disconnects from my smart watch, reboots the calories, and provides macros of 0 carbs, 6% protein, and 0 fats.

It keeps me motivated and even though I struggle greatly with my relationship with food.,"It is up to you if you want to consume the calories you burn when exercising. It is most likely that you will reach your weight loss goal faster if you exclude those calories, however, faster doesn't always equal a better result in the long run. You should also make sure, if you decide to exclude your exercise calories, that you are never hungry and that you feel well. If you feel hungry, fatigued or have any other symptom of unwellness, this most likely indicates that you are not consuming enough calories. The important thing is to listen to your body!

While there’s a couple of good ideas, there’s only 4 to choose from for each meal; hardly worth paying for a premium membership. Also, I use the suggested meal and the nutritional tracker STILL tells me I’m off track, whether it be too high in carbs or protein.

It is true that you can collect recipes into favorites, but (unless Im using the app wrong) there is no way to create meals for the week and to generate shopping lists from there. You have to go into each recipe to find out what ingredients to use. I can find the same recipes by searching keto sites and I can track my fitness through my fitness watch.

I have noticed that a lot of the nutrition facts on the scanned barcodes or search option for foods are inaccurate, so you really have to pay attention to what you are entering.

More than half of the recipes I was able to view have a startling high percentage of fat—45-56%. It’s just my opinion but there shouldn’t be any recipe, let alone many recipes, on a health app or site that is that high in fat. Any kind of fat. Second is sugar, fiber, sodium and saturated fat are locked in the free version, items that are free in other food trackers. I’m all about paying developers. They deserve it.

I also really like all the smiley faces to let me know how healthy or not my meal was. However, My Fitness Pal has a much better list of food options to choose from, probably because it has been around for so much longer. It would be a better app if the developers could pre-load more nutritious information from brands and restaurants without relying on users to have to input it.

That is tedious though because not all of the recommended recipes are appropriate for your selected diet plan. There is also a feature where you can select diet preferences and allergies.

It’s great that you can measure your overall fitness and choose a food plan to follow based off your health. But the food recipes in my opinion are lacking. I find them to be a little too much with ingredients. I’ve seen people lose weight just by eating simpler meals than what they offer.

My suggestion is to add a body type feature to help men and women cater to their body type. I’m speaking of the categories of Ectomorph, Mesomorph, and Endomorph. I’d love for the daily caloric intake to be shaped around certain people’s body types. It would help people to target their dietary preferences.

Hadn’t been on the app longer than a few minutes before they were offering plans. Premium says it was only a few dollars a month for a wide variety of benefits. Thinking it was a month to month plan only to find out they outrightly charge you $50. They also don’t email you to let you know that you subscribed to it except for a receipt from Apple for an amount. Apple won’t process a refund either. $50 isn’t worth the basic features they give you for weight loss. Spend carefully.,"We appreciate your feedback!

Also, I don’t understand why it shows “monthly” rates for 3-6-12 months but then takes the whole sum out in one transaction - I feel like that’s pointless and you may as well have it make sense and make it into a 3-6-12 mo contract and take out monthly. Otherwise it’s a great calorie tracking tool and I like the smiley faces, it’s a nice little touch of motivation.","When you purchase a Premium subscription you can either choose to be charged monthly (1-month subscription) or you can pay in advance (all other subscriptions).

The first food I tried to enter was totally inaccurate a d there was no way to change it without creating a new food. Accuracy is pretty important if you are counting calories. On the particular item it was over by 40 calories. I wanted to give it a shot but the inaccuracy straight out of the gate made me decide to delete. The design is really appealing.

Lifesum shows me good choices, bad choices and where I stand at the end of the day. The notifications are great encouragement to drink, eat or move. It syncs with my Fitbit so I know what I burn and what I eat. And that’s just the beginning! There are diet plans, recipes, blogs and so much more to help you get to where you want to be.",Thank you very much for your awesome review and feedback!

I love how it connects with my Health app on my iPhone and it allows me to scan the barcodes of the things I eat for easy access. This app is great for anyone who is health conscious or trying to loose/gain Weight. I see a lot of applications in this app to be used for people trying the Keto diet. My only recommendation would be to work out some of the bugs with the scanner because sometimes the app didn’t give me the right calorie to portion ratio that was printed on the box,Thank you very much for your positive review and sorry to hear that you're having some issues with the scanner!

The only thing I would like is if I could manually add food with any known nutritional values like protein, fat, etc. instead of just having the option of putting calories in only. I also wish there was an option to maintain weight versus only lose/gain weight. Sometimes it stops recording your exercise as well.",You find the requested option as follows:

One of the things that appealed to me when I previewed the app was the variety of plans. The downside was that it doesn’t explain the details of each forcing me to try and research each. After signing up I found that the meals did not appeal to me. I grew up on the Pacific Rim cuisine of Hawaii and I could not see preparing and eating the recipes included. Also it’s extremely difficult to enter food consumed. The inventory is not as comprehensive as another app that I am not naming. Expensive lesson learned as I am not going to be using this for most of the 6 months that I purchased.,We are very sorry to hear that you feel that way. Please contact us at contact@lifesum.com with more details about your experience so we can understand better what you do not like about the app.

It doesn’t allow you to see graphics of your macro nutrients. Long story short, all of these features that are missing are free on my fitness pal. I regret paying $50 to use this app when I could’ve gotten all of this for freeWith my fitness pal. You do get recipes that are specific for your type of diet (vegan, keto, etc.) But you can find it for free extensively on the Internet. This app is not worth it.",We are sorry to hear this!

But as soon as I downloaded it and put in my info, I realized it doesn’t let me set my macro targets myself. What’s the point of this then?? The carbs were waaaay too high for me to lose weight and the protein was way too low. It’s not useful as is. I have to pay to go premium to get a bunch of features I’m not interested in just to be able to set custom macro targets? There’s not even a free trial to see if going premium is worth it, which every other app I’ve seen has. This is very disappointing.

The recipes seem pretty easy and straightforward to make, however the description said that there was a digital shopping list. I can’t seem to find that. How do I know which foods to eat on a Paleo plan that are not part of the recipes? There doesn’t seem to be any food lists in this app that I could work off of and perhaps create my own recipes. Can someone give me an answer on that? Thanks!","HI there, thank you for your feedback! Glad to hear you  like the app. The shoppinglist feature is really for the meal planner, so that when you choose a meal from the planner e.g breakfast you can put all ingredients from that recipe in your shopping cart/list.

The app gave me a suggestion to look at certain recipes and then I would try to scroll and look and BAM “Get premium” would pop up again.

However, the food data base is a mess. First, the scanner functionality works about 50% of the time; and second, the food database is SO difficult to use.

My only complaint is they keep trying to promote this new Life Score thing, but every time I take the test it crashes while I’m halfway through and then it won’t allow me to try taking it again for like a month. I’ve gone through this cycle like three times.

I like how it calculates net carbs and the app is visually appealing. However, I am so disappointed with the bugs! First of all, I’ve used many diet/fitness apps and never had calories and macros so off as this! One listing of a cup of pistachios says 170 and another says 617!! Also the measurements are way off on a lot of items. One tablespoon of half and half is 3.5 ounces?!! And then the calculations are off. For example I put in 2 tablespoons of half and half which is 40 calories, and then 3 tablespoons is 105! Please fix these issues!","Thanks for your review.

I accidentally forgot to record my weight yesterday, and needed to update my weight today. For some reason, every time I put in my weight (only 1.5lbs lighter than the last time i updated it in app) the app gives me a notification saying they thought I typed the wrong numbers and wanted me to try again. I’m super frustrated as I obviously want to track my progress, but cannot. Is it because it thinks I lost weight too quickly? I’m pretty young and have had an active lifestyle my whole life, so losing 1.5lbs in ~2-3 days isn’t concerning to me.","Thank you very much for reaching out.

The database for homemade foods in extremely lacking. You can always look up brand name foods but if you eat chicken breads with rice and broccoli good luck finding and accurate nutrient spread without adding it yourself. Really makes me angry because this is basic foods. I made a half pound Hamburger and salad and I can’t get a proper count, but a Big Mac or some obscure fast food is easily found. Honestly the only reason I’m using this app is because I made a mistake and purchased it because I thought I was choosing Lose It.

It logged a weight for me incorrectly and I can’t figure out how to remove it. I was missing the updated plans and only had the option of 4 plans.

Protein too, because I want to be fit and plants are lower in protein by calories and amino score. Though this is basic knowledge, this app doesn’t allow you to specify you eat grass fed only and that all the meat you eat must be conventional low quality meat. Your health score is based off the amount of plants you eat and though I hit all my micronutrients almost everyday, I’m classified as “unhealthy”. Also, the biggest issue is the premium. It’s not monthly, so if you want to cancel, well there goes $40 to $80.","Thank you very much for your valuable feedback, we have forwarded it to the team in charge for their knowledge!

What a disappointment. I can see how this would be useful for people who eat meat, though—otherwise, not many choices or options to choose from, and not as customizable as advertised. However, the calculator for the macros isn't beneficial and doesn't guide you through what the proper % balance would be for your goals. It presets it but not to what would be accurate for what your goals are. The app isn't exceptionally user friendly all in all. Great concept of an app, though; just needs a lot of work.","Thank you for your feedback, We are sorry to hear that y ou feel this way!"

The one issue that was bothersome for me was that the Daily Progress bar is a day ahead of my tracked day. Ex: I recorded my meals on Wednesday July 24th but then see it portrayed in Thursday’s Daily Progress bar. It’ll then tell me I ate too many calories that day because it was meant to be a fasting day. I’m not sure how well I explained that but perhaps it was my own mistake.,Thank you for your feedback and sorry to hear about this issue!

620,3,2018-01-02T15:19:36.000Z,DustyBaker.78,Good Concept But...,I like the idea of this app-- tracking food/exercise weather it's to get in shape or stay in shape. However the food ratings seem to be way off. Whenever I add a healthy food it always has a frowny face saying it is high in carbohydrates-- honestly we NEED carbs for energy and I just find it pathetic that a banana has a frowny but a frozen food high in sodium has a smiley face. I find it upsetting and I think it could lead people in the wrong direction! Is there anyway to turn off the smiley+frowny faces because fruit+veggies+legumes+etc. are NOT unhealthy :),"Thank you very much for your feedback! Part of the database is user-created and unfortunately there are cases where fruit or vegetable gets a ""frown"" as the creator did not enter the correct macros. So this can explain the ratings."

Then they told me, essentially, ‘Too bad, so sad, you’re SOL.’ They don’t know how to fix the problem and don’t know when it will be fixed. And, no, they won’t refund what I paid. I’ll have to go through Apple for that. The moral? Don’t give them any money.","Thank you for your review.

This app is exactly what I wanted until I realized they are front runners for keto. I want a plan for EVERYONE. Meat eaters, paleo, keto, vegetarian, all the other diets out there, AND VEGAN.

But after buying the subscription I’ve noticed that the food data base is very flawed. There is limited food options listed, and often it will not pull up options for simple searches such as “egg” or salad. In addition, there is little to none data of any sort of fast food.

The recipes are insane & include things I wouldn’t even think about eating on a normal day. Lots of smoked salmon, fennel, purée and other things that my local grocery store don’t even carry.

Anyways fast forward a year later LifeSum charged my credit card for a new year. I double checked in my subscription on my iPhone to see if I still got it and to cancel. GUESS WHAT?!?! It’s not in my subscriptions on iTunes. Not only I have to contact multiple parties to cancel I can’t even do it manually because I did and they still charged me. Just don’t do it. Don’t get this app. Very deceptive,"Thank you for reaching out to us. If a subscription renews that means that it is still active on the payment platform - otherwise, a renewal is impossible.

I wish. 160 calories for a whole cup of roasted pumpkin seeds? No. Someone needs to really fix this information - isn’t this a large part of the value of the app? And those were “verified” listings!

I upgraded, it said 5.99 a month I think for six months. I got access to plans like keto things, which I wasn’t interested in the diet plans they have and more diagnostics for your fat,  calories, etc and it wasn’t worth it. Then I tried to cancel my subscription and it charged me the full amount that would have been charged in six months.","Thank you for your review. You were charged the full amount upfront and not when you tried cancelling your subscription. The reason we show the monthly cost on the 12 month membership, is for our users to see the difference in price from subscribing yearly and monthly. A monthly subscription is also available. We show you the total price before you pay. We are sorry if this wasn't clear enough. Let us know through contact@lifesum.com if you need assistance with a refund!"

899,1,2019-02-07T18:15:02.000Z,LookAtACellBioTextbook,This app recommends STARVATION,"Hi, prospective doctor here. For people attempting to lose weight, this app recommends you undergo “two days of fasting” or the keto diet. Both of these options cut out sugar which is necessary for glycolysis, the metabolic pathway that fuels your body and synthesizes the ATP and Pyruvate that is used for Pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. All these processes keep your body alive and functioning. Eliminating glucose long term will lead to muscle deterioration and in severe cases, keto acidosis or self-canibalisation. Both are LIFE THREATENING. I suggest seeking a nutritionist who knows the bodily processes and not a trendy app that favors body image above health.","Thank you for your concern. We believe that both 5:2 fasting and the ketogenic diet are low risk in the short term and indeed many users report success with these diets. We find the risks due to being overweight are far higher, which is why we include these diets in our recommendations. We would like more long-term research on both diets, but unfortunately these studies take time. We always attempt to offer the healthiest version of a diet that we believe is possible today. For individuals with health conditions, please consult your doctor before making large changes."

You can scan Sara Lee 45 calorie bread, pretty clear how many calories, right? Not on Lifesum and this is the norm.

985,4,2019-01-16T15:31:48.000Z,Bokehgirl,Good looking app,I love the variety of weight loss plans my one thought though is that for intermittent fasting plans if you could also offer ones like 16:8 where you fast for 16 hours then eat. I am more partial to a plan like that but could use guidance and the ability to track it accordingly on the app. Is there any possibility to add this soon?,Thank you very much for your review!

I’m really disappointed. Done with this app.,Thank you very much for your feedback!

I’m on a specific medically prescribed diet and I eat a specific number of grams of my macros and none of the plans fit. If I’m paying almost $50 for this app, I should be able to design my own plan. My free app lets me do this!!","Thank you for your rating! You can customise your plan when following the Classic diet plan, in which you can adjust both your calorie allowance and macros. Good luck with reaching your goal!"

Recently they have taken away the cool customizable features that have always been FREE. Now you have to pay monthly subscriptions....no thanks. What happened to paying for apps once? I would gladly pay $5 for this app total, but $5 a MONTH is ridiculous.",Thanks for your feedback. We had to remove this feature for several reasons but the app will still automatically calculate the calorie goal / macros that match your goal based on your details and follow the recommendations for healthily reaching your goal.

1591,1,2019-01-30T07:48:16.000Z,bugwash19,Does not calculate net carbs,"So this app is pretty. I bought it. I regret it. This does not work for keto dieters. Why? This app counts total carbs for your daily allowance instead of net carbs! What?!?! Even with the correct macro distribution, the carb intake is always over for me. For instance- hass avocado has 6gm of carbs and 5gm of fiber. Net carb is 1gm so that is what the app should count towards your daily carb allowance. But it doesn’t! Soooo disappointed! Please fix it! This app is useless for keto!!!!!",Sorry to hear that! Can you send us some screenshots at contact@lifesum.com so we can look into this? Thanks in advance!

I find it a bit lazy to make the users in charge of the database, and as we can all see it isn’t working out. If other apps managed to do it I’m sure lifesum can too. And as I’m paying to use the app I think resources should be delegated to this.","The verified foods are from several food databases: the USDA, food items from Livsmedelsverket in Sweden, from the UK Food Standards Agency and the BLS from Germany."

Which is confusing when using apps because we assume it’s per month and then you can cancel. Now I’m stuck again with an app that I won’t use probably!  Doesn’t even provide that many options for the price. Don’t buy,"When you purchase a Premium subscription you can either choose to be charged monthly (1-month subscription) or you can pay in advance (all other subscriptions). Choosing a subscription with a runtime longer than 1 month you will get a discount, just as you get one when you are signing up with, for example, a gym membership."

My fitness pal or lose it is just much simpler to edit sorry guys deff not coming back to this!,"Hi BosnianAJ01, thanks for your feedback! Sorry to hear that you have had some negative experiences. When tracking an item, you can edit the amount of servings as well as the serving type. For your example of eating half of something, you would want to select the serving type, and then the amount of that particular serving, so, if you ate half of a banana, you could select 'whole banana' as the serving type, and 0.5 as the amount to track half! Hopefully this helps with the issue you were having, if not, feel free to reach out to our support contact@lifesum.com"

Much better apps available to count net carbs!,Thank you for your feedback!
2453,5,2018-04-11T14:34:05.000Z,dandelionlion,Incredible and perfect,"This app is with every penny. I purchased the annual subscription and have been using it for only about a week but so far it's been incredibly valuable. I have been entering in every meal, snack, and my water intake. Drinking water has helped me to be healthier and stay hydrated! I've been hitting my goals every single day. I love the design of the app, it's so beautiful. The designer did an amazing job at creating a very nuanced and detailed experience. It's a joy to use this app and it's fun! The illustrations and colors are fantastic. I was a MyFitnessPal user for years and since they were acquired by UA they stopped updating, improving, and evolving the app in any way. This is fitness and food tracking at a new and modern level. It's really a wonderful app. It is absolutely helping me to reshape my lifestyle. The added bonus is the integration of recipes that you can easily add to your meal tracking, not to mention the food is actually pretty good and simple to make. What more could you want? Also it's really nice to be able to choose between different types of diets, with each adjusting the calories you should be having at each meal. A feature that's really awesome is being able to see a summary of your intake for the day, which is broken down and categorized across protein, carbs, and fat, in a beautiful infographic of graphs and pie charts. I love just looking at this app!  So in that way it's quite personal, which makes the whole experience far more engaging than any other fitness app I've ever used. It's well worth the price and I will continue to use the app throughout my day to stay on track and be as healthy as possible. Keep up the amazing work Lifesum!",Thank you so much for your feedback! We very much appreciate that!

2481,5,2020-08-22T03:43:01.000Z,Pegasister23,READ THIS,"So I think everyone can agree that losing/maintaining/gaining weight or just even remembering to eat healthily can be a very tough thing for anybody. This app, is honestly the HOLY GRAIL of nutrition tracker app. AND YES I SAY NUTRITION, because it is not just a weight loss, cal counter, water tracker, it’s so much more than that. I know this because I can probably say I have used every freakin app to try and make the habit of healthy living stick. So there is a few bugs here and there but nothing I can say that would make me stop using it. Mainly just certain calories not matching up etc. but I doubt the makers of this app can control that due to it probably being inputted from other resources, BUT I will say, it’s almost 75% accurate if you’re not specifically measuring anything out. I’m saying this because I do measure everything out, and honestly if you do measure your food and put it into the app, it is extremely accurate, some of the work has to be put on your side because a phone screen cannot accurately calculate how much your eating. It is a tool!!!! An extremely useful, well made, and STUNNING tool to help you along whatever health journey you are going on. My FAVORITE function of the app of all is you can create your own recipes where it calculates the calories in what you made, let me tell you, an absolute game changer. If you have an Apple Watch, it pairs the app to your activity😍. I lost 14 lbs and toned up (of course with exercise and such) but with this app by my side I honestly felt like it was effortless. Just try it for yourself I promise.",Thank you for your review and positive words! We are happy to read that you like Lifesum!

2554,4,2020-04-26T13:41:26.000Z,Brookliey C.,"So many great features, but can be difficult to use.","I’ve actually enjoyed the many many features that are all bundled into this one app, and I don’t think any app can compare! However, I think there’s still some bugs and things that make it less easy to use. For one, sometimes you can scan the barcode of the food you ate (thinking it’ll be faster and easier), but then the calories that Lifesum logs are actually different from the calories on the package with the same serving size. I’m often having to jerry-rig the serving size to make it match the package because even an extra ten calories can make the app give you a frowny-face for the meal. Secondly, maybe it’s just my account specifically, but my weight is never recorded in permanence in the weight log. Everyday that I log my weight, it starts me right back off where I weighed before I started using the app, saying “wow you lost 5 pounds today!” when really I lost one pound and the other lost pounds were logged on previous days. In my calendar of weight statistics, it’s a stagnant, flat line from my goal weight for about a week and then will drop down as soon as I update it. Tomorrow, though, it’ll pretend I never logged a change yesterday and go right back to my starting weight. Lastly, I wish that the units the servings were marked in was more clear. Often “pieces” will actually mean the one serving size as mentioned on the package of the food, yet pieces makes you want to type in te NUMBER OF PIECES you ate. Like pizza rolls. “One pieces” is actually 6 pieces and 220 calories. In spite of all this, I think the app is beautiful in design and I love how many features are available. I also think that premium might not be worth it... I’m using premium now during a free month trial, and I don’t feel like it gave me a whole lot more. I don’t feel like having this premium month gave me a taste of anything I’d consider buying after my free period is over.",Thank you for your thorough review and feedback!

That does not mean that you are not allowed to eat anything but limited in order to get the desired effect."

2825,3,2020-10-16T22:02:25.000Z,miraiza63,Not what I expected.,"I decided to do the 3 month Lifesum. I've had enough time to determine it is not for me. (I only used 1.25 months) It doesn't scan food items correctly. I will scan in the package and the calories and protein wouldn’t be accurate to the item I just scanned per serving. I’d either get the calories right or the protein but not both. Over half the time, you have to measure your food by weight instead of doing it by cups. I have to tweak most of my stuff and you can't look up uncommon food items a little under half the time. And I haven't once used there meal plans because at least one item in the recipe we don't have in our home. It normally is an uncommon ingredient that poor people wouldn’t have in their cupboard. They don't set up planning for a weekly bases or grocery lists like I was hoping. And there recipes aren't exactly set to your style. Chose clean eating and most recipes still lacked the protein factor which is my hardest obstacle. (I can never seem to eat enough in my diet) So don't get this app unless you are only counting calories and if that is the case don't do the upgrade. Not worth it. But I'm glad I did it so I now know what it all entails. This was a good step to finding what I AM looking for. Calorie counter and meal planner combo. But even that isn’t needed if you have the Fitbit app. PS it also doesn’t hook up to MY version of the Fitbit which was disappointing. If you still decide you’re going for it and want to pay for the upgrade double check in your Fitbit app to see if you’re Fitbit is compatible. And if you DO have a Fitbit I highly suggest you just pay the premium for that.","Thank you for your valuable feedback, we appreciate it."

2925,3,2019-08-06T17:08:21.000Z,Kree8vkim,Need help/suggestions,"Hello! Thank you for what appears to be a really good app to get me on track for losing weight. However in just starting out it hasn’t been very user-friendly. For instance I wanted to input a burger, with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise, no bun. It would be helpful if, next to each item I need to track, there was an “increase” or “decrease” button. For example, currently,  to input 2 slices of bacon, I have to type the word “bacon” in the app two separate times and add it to be tracked, where it would be much simpler and less time-consuming if you had the ability to hit an “increase” or “decrease” sign next to each food to indicate that you’re having two slices of bacon (or three or four), without having to go back and input the bacon slice two, three, or four times (If that makes sense!) Also, the ability to delete anything on the “pre-planned menus” that the app suggests. For instance, on the “beef burger and lettuce leaves” dish, I do not eat onions, and I cannot eat cheese. There is nowhere for me to subtract those items from the “track this item” so then my calories, etc, will not be accurate. Also during the “test questions” there is no place to put foods that I wish to specifically avoid (ie in my case, cheese and fish). I’m not vegan/vegetarian;  I do eat beef, poultry, pork... but not seafood. And I don’t care for cheese and yogurt. So it would be nicer to have the ability to input foods to avoid so that I don’t get the suggested “salmon” meal ever! This is just my first day of using so I may have more thoughts as I go along but these are what jumped out at me to begin with! Thanks!",Thanks for the feedback!

It’s only after you pay that you find all that is lacking. Most important, you cannot go back and add or edit past data. I missed entering my weight yesterday and now it’s impossible to enter it. Lifesum has such little integration with health/fitness products that, yes, I had to enter my weight daily. My Garmin watch and scale had zero integration with Lifesum. And because of the lack of integration with standard fitness products I was unable to even track my steps or enter my step count from my Garmin watch. It is unbelievable that Lifesum doesn’t integrate with any of the  Garmin products. The list of fitness products Lifesum integrates with is unfortunately very small.

My biggest complaint though is as an extremely active person I do my own macro and calorie calculations. Lifesum’s app though (when you aign up) tries to be helpful and did them for me and they are not correct, and there does not appear to be any easy option to manually edit them. So while the app gives me an accurate calories and macro count, the “goal” total that shows whether I hit my marks or not is always off base. If they added a simple update to allow a manual altering of it this app would go from decent to great.","Hi there, thank you so much for your valuable feedback. We appreciate it and have sent it to each responsible team for their knowledge.  When you set up your Lifesum profile you get your calorie goal based on height, age, weight, sex and daily activity level.

I feel as if I was a bit misled while researching an app. I needed a meal plan for every day with a grocery list. Well, guess what? You’ll get that, but with only certain “plans.”  I’m not vegetarian. I’m not into paleo. I surely don’t want to eat like Denise every day. You’ll get enough meal options for a week.  I tried all meal tracts that came with grocery lists  (you’ll get grocery lists for 4 plans, you’re on your own for the rest). I really did. For a month. The recipes provided are horrible. No taste, bland, and quite frankly, I’d rather pay $10 for bulk unsalted butter than a 4 oz container of ghee. I cooked enough for my family of four. We ended up throwing over half of every meal in the trash. The dogs would not even eat it. Money wasted because the recipes tasted like trash.  What chefs approve of these recipes? Please let me know because I’ll keep an eye out for their names and avoid them. I’m open minded about different styles and food preps, but this is just bad. I 100% wasted money on this app and on the grocery store trips. The turkey on rye sandwich was the best offering of the bunch and even that’s a stretch. Yeah, I lost weight, but it was because the recipes were unappetizing, tasteless, and with the money wasted on groceries, I did not want to eat. If you are really and truly looking for help with weight loss and meal prep, please look elsewhere. This app could be great, but it’s not. So much potential, just not there yet",Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on our app and sorry to hear that you were not satisfied.

We offer variety of meal plans where the set ratio of macro nutrients differ. However, none of the meal plans focuses on a low fat intake - but instead promote a intake of healthy unsaturated fat such as olive oil, avocado, nuts and seeds. On our diets on the other hand, you can adjust your own macro ratio. We will suggest a recommended ratio for the specific diet chosen, but it is adjustable - so if you would prefer to eat a low fat diet, you can lower the fat and raise the carbs and/or protein."

3109,1,2020-01-14T23:16:10.000Z,CCW223,Misleading,"My family and I do a Paleo/Whole Foods lifestyle which means we eat very clean with sugars that are non-processed like honey, maple syrup, and dates in limited amounts. I found this app very misleading because certain carbs are rated unhealthy but it then tells you your carb count is low and to eat more???? Which is essentially what the paleo diet is: low carb and higher protein with healthy fat choices. As an example Cassava flour is 100% carbs so it is rated as 😐 but your total daily intake of calories will tell you to eat more? If your rating certain carb foods as 😐 but pushing increased carb content how in the world is someone supposed to eat carbs unless it is essentially fruit based. I will state white potatoes are rated 88% carbs but are also a great nutrient source which is misleading again. So I do realize the app is pushing a healthier choice of carb but when food is mixed in the right proportions cassava can be a healthy choice so again??? Secondly, cashews and other nuts are not a healthy choice if they are in flour form but again in the right proportions they can be. Third, Ghee, avocado, and olive oil are not considered healthy choices either. Lastly, you can eat meat sources on the app (red meat) which drastically increases your fat intake for the day which is rated as a great source of nutrients and minerals. The concept is a good idea but very misleading and costly if you pay for the in app purchases which I will not do. I will be going back to my FatSecret because there is no “food shaming” going on in that app. By the way if your going to rate foods based on “healthy” maybe developers should consider a system that rates the use of pesticide and herbicide exposure along with nutrient depleted farmlands that have even vegetables highly unhealthy!","Thank you for your review.

But, do yourself a favor and use it for a month before committing to a $50 year long plan.  I really wanted to like the app, but the macros were incorrect on the food about half the time. If you caught it, you could report the error, then look through the database until you found something similar, but that’s about all you could do. Also, it would incorrectly tally up negative net carbs.  There were several times I ended up with more net carbs left to eat than I started with, all because the app calculated a food and gave it a negative net carb total.   The serving sizes were often incorrect for the macros given, as well. That can really throw your Ketosis out of wack.",We apologize for the issue you are experiencing.

The User Interface is nicely laid out, the tabs are great and the icons are helpful. Even the food catalog is very nicely laid out with multiple levels of meaningful entries.",

3163,5,2008-09-15T15:56:35.000Z,dujoducom,"Great app, worth the cost, getting better","I really like this app! They thought alot about what operations will take the most time and tried to make them easier. You can create custom foods, then create meals (sets of food items) and add them to the directory. The dirctory is well organized with features like searching and marking favorites. People complain about the food database, but these things take time to develop and it sounds like they will be user submitable, so they will be handled by the community. Also the nutritional information varies a lot between different brands, so you are going to have to end up entering in a lot of custom foods anyway, I don't see this as a problem or an issue that iShape could possibly solve aside from doing what they have already done and make an expandable database.",
3164,5,2017-03-16T18:03:05.000Z,Brodak,Excellent and Easy to Use,"I use this app every day without fail. It has made me exponentially more aware of what I am eating and how much I snack throughout the day. By tracking what I eat carefully, I have been able to make smarter food choices and I snack mindlessly far less than I used to. I also love the water, fruit, and vegetable trackers because I have also been consciously drinking more water and making a point to eat more vegetables. The app is beautifully designed and very user friendly, and I enjoy it so much that I paid for the full subscription. I use this app more than I use social media. I appreciate that the app helps making healthy choices fun and simple, and I would highly recommend it regardless of whether you are trying to lose weight or not.",
3165,4,2017-04-05T19:41:48.000Z,CE360,I'm enjoying it!,"This is the first time I've ever tracked my food or paid close attention to how many calories I'm consuming every day. I'm not trying to lose much weight.. just working to get into better shape and improve my overall health. I really like using Lifesum so far. It integrates nicely with the Apple Watch, and my suggested intake changes based on my activity throughout the day. I love that you can add your own recipes and save meals! These features, along with the ability to save favorite foods will eventually save me lots of time logging food going forward. I also find that I save time by planning my meals in advance vs. logging each meal throughout the day. I haven't tried any of their recipes yet, but it looks like they have some good ones! Suggestions for improvement: This might be too complicated, but I'd love to see some integration with Allrecipes / the ability to quickly add favorite recipes from this site. I would also like to see more nutritional data (vitamins and minerals). I feel like most of their plans are a little crazy with the suggested daily protein intake (it's usually very high). All in all, though, the only thing that's really disappointed me is that I recommended this app to my mother and after a few days it wouldn't let her use it anymore unless she upgraded to a premium membership. I was under the impression that you could still use basic features without upgrading.",
3166,3,2017-08-01T00:57:13.000Z,semperes,Love a lot of aspects but definitely still needs to grow!,"As soon as I downloaded this, I loved how easy it was to use and how the interface was so visually pleasing and quick to get the hang of. I also loved how I could track my water intake as well as my exercise of the day. But as the days went by, some issues popped up that I really wanted to address in a review. Firstly is the accuracy of the food you can track. There have been more than a few times that the nutrition label read differently than what Lifesum had listed and because of that, I find this app not all that trustworthy on the nutrients I'm getting day to day and that's disappointing. I would also add that I wish the database had a more rigid system, it's a little weird to see more than one listing for a banana and not knowing which one would be the most accurate. Secondly I wish the targeted calories could be adjusted by the user if they so choose. I don't exactly want to follow what this app suggests when it comes to how much I should be eating for weight loss, I definitely think it overestimates. Lastly I wish there was an easier way to track meals you ate days before or ate for dinner one day and ate it for lunch the next. I will still continue to use this app but I hope in the future to see some changes!",Thank you very much for your feedback!

The new design is nice.. BUT!!! why take away the nutrient macro pie chart?!?!?!?!?!? That is just as important to know either you are slimming down or putting on some mass!!!! Doesn't help when you take in 3000+ calories when the majority was fat, or you didn't take in the amount of protein you needed. Please please please bring back the macro pie chart... That's is the only thing I ask for... Thanks....",
3171,5,2015-02-12T18:28:22.000Z,pgscg,"So easy to track calories, protein, fat!","I used to do this in a spreadsheet. After adding foods I eat frequently that were not already in the huge database, I can easily set up my day and make changes if my schedule, dining out, grocery shopping changes. It's so clear I need to add exercise, as I know my precise intake and don't want to eat less. Things I would like added: ability to add a food to My Things when after scanning, finding it barcode was already in the database and verifying the food had been correctly entered, instead of only having the ability to add it to my diary. I had searched for it before I tried to manually add it, but it didn't show up. If it's in My Things, it will show up quickly at the top. I would also like to see a schedule of my nutrition, exercise and weight progress in addition to the progress bar that shows my starting, current and goal weight.",
3172,1,2015-11-17T00:32:34.000Z,arual9109,Disappointed,"This app has great potential but after using it for less than 24 hours (yes, that's all it took), I must admit that it is a letdown. I entered my personal information, updated my goals, connected to my Fitbit, logged my food and exercise... Only to find out that the information I was inputting was not saved accurately. Regardless of how many times I changed it, my birthdate and starting weight kept reverting back to an incorrect amount (that wasn't entered by me at anytime). This led me to doubt about the application saving the other information I was entering such as calories or workouts. When I spoke to a representative, I was told this issue would be fixed in about 3 weeks. That is ridiculous! Don't launch your app until it's ready to be used. Especially one that customers pay for! Another complaint is the meal logging. It is very difficult to determine meals based on ounces or grams. There are few foods that I found that were listed by serving size or quantity. Lifesum's selection of meals is not very expansive and most days, I found myself looking up the meals with another application to ensure I was accurately logging them. NOT WORTH THE TIME.",
3173,5,2016-01-29T05:46:39.000Z,Jstew88lifesumfan,Fan of Lifesum it's helped me a lot,"So Lifesum has seriously helped me. I haven't had any glitches with my app and don't struggle with added food to my food diary tracker. It's really easy and simple to follow, it does the math for you, to figure out how many calories your eating, how many grams of carbs, protein, and fat your consuming and how many you have left to consume. I've done the ketone diet before I got Lifesum... I only lost 2 pounds a month and was completely confused why I wasn't losing more! I got the Lifesum app and it showed me (by tracking everything I ate) that I wasn't eating the right balance of carbs, protein and fat for the ketone diet. I was floored when I found out certain brands of food that I thought were healthy was totally ruining my diet. I lost about 10 pounds within less than 6 weeks solely by using this app. I can scan in barcodes of food items I get and see how much of it I can eat. It's great, Lifesum rates it for me too to see if it's a good fit for my diet. I'm gonna keep and use this app for a while. And they have awesome recipes too.",
3174,4,2017-02-09T12:48:42.000Z,D. Hill,Lifesum,"Lifesum to me is an application that represents the potential of how our mobile devices can assist in us reaching the best physical version of ourselves. While my initial review is only based on the free version, I believe I can note how beneficial this application is. The application begins by asking about your age, gender, height and weight. Lifesum incorporates a beautiful colorful yet simple to navigate design. The bottom menu tabs are where users can bounce from category to category whether it be diet, nutritional facts or another section. The app makes it easy to input your diet with a comprehensive database that caters to any meal of the day as well as water cup diagrams that fill up and mark your progress with a simple tap on the image. Users can read daily nutritional facts and articles to better determine what is best for you. The premium version allows you to receive specialized recipes. I feel I have only touched a tip of the iceberg when it comes to the effect Lifesum can have on my life and many others.",
3175,3,2017-02-12T19:38:38.000Z,Henryjperc,Lots of potential but improvement needed,"I recently upgraded to the premium version after using the free version for about a week. I was very happy with the free version but found that the premium version has left me slightly less satisfied. One reason for this is the fact that you must constantly answer the 41 Life Score questions to get an updated score. To me, this is an annoying process and I wish it would update automatically from the foods I've recorded in my diary. Secondly, I also wish the fruit and vegetable trackers would update based off the food that I've recorded in the diary. It seems redundant to have to press an extra button to record this information. Finally, I was under the impression that the premium version would provide some sort of ""eat this, not that"" feature for the foods it deems unhealthy. I haven't seen this feature and I think it would be great. In the end, I really like this app but I don't feel like I'm getting a the best value for the premium version. I truly believe that it can get there with some updates and adjustments but for now I remain slightly unsatisfied. The app seems pretty new so I am more than happy to stick with it with hopes that it makes adjustments in the future.",
3176,4,2017-02-14T03:39:39.000Z,Lo-sim,Near perfect,"This is my favorite app for tracking calories. It blows My Fitness Pal out of the water in terms of its ability to teach you how to eat right for your fitness goals and how to generally lead a healthy lifestyle. The only flaw is that it has crowd sourced some of its nutrient data from users, which means there is some noticeable human error as you start searching for foods and looking at calorie counts and serving sizes. As long as you are being conscious about your foods and understand the basics when it comes to measurements and serving sizes, you'll avoid improperly tracking your meals. As with anything in life -- it's on you to think critically even when you want an app to take care of the bulk of the work. Trust that Lifesum does a lot for the small fee you pay to unlock those features. It's incredibly well designed. They thought deeply about UX and how to drive reengagement and motivate the user to make good choices. Well done Lifesum!",
3177,1,2017-02-18T16:34:27.000Z,Whirlygirl13,Hugely disappointing,"No room to customize, not even with the upgrade (based on the description of added features). We prepare a large number of ingredients and dishes from scratch, so logging food in Lifesum is not accurate, as we're restricted to what's in the database. Also, the inability to see what's in the upgrade, specifically diet plans is frustrating. The default plan limits users to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack, all of which are calorie restricted. So for users who consume 5-6 small meals/snacks a day, this isn't helpful. If I log meals as meals, then I'm WAY under my calorie allowance as dictated by Lifesum, and some of my snacks don't get logged. If I log all of my snacks under the single ""snack"" tab, my meals are way under and my snacks are way over, according to Lifesum. There also isn't a way to log times food is consumed. Lifesum is probably alright for someone interested in very basic nutritional record keeping, but for someone needing to log for medical or serious health/fitness tracking, Lifesum has completely missed the mark. And to charge ridiculous monthly fees for a product that is mediocre at best is just ludicrous. Save your time, money, and frustration and use another method.",

It works very similarly. I love that I can log a photo of my meal along with the data. I like the smiley faces I get for healthy choices. And it's visually pleasing, which matters when you are trying to use it all day long. I just use the basic, free version.",

It is very easy to navigate and I like getting the little smiley face by my meal when I made good choices. I have many reasons why I need to keep track of what I eat, mainly because my skin tends to react to what I eat and I have been recently cutting out dairy for health reasons. That being said, since this is a overall ""healthy lifestyle"" app, I would LOVE to see more options for tracking, such as dairy-free diets, as well as maybe incorporating other lifestyle habits such as hours of sleep (it plays a big part in our lifestyle!) I would also loooove to see a way to track specific symptoms or reactions so a clear connection can be made between our food and how it affects us, such as how well your skin is doing (breakouts specifically), energy levels, cravings and how to target them, ability to focus, and things of that sort. Overall the app is great so far and I'm looking forward to seeing it's growth!!",Thanks for the feedback! Please feel free to leave suggestions for improvement here: https://lifesum.uservoice.com

I actually like the fact that the entire database of food is not on here, there is a bit of a setup getting the foods you eat entered but once it's in it's easy and you don't have 50,000 others to go through to find the one you want. Having the database online didn't make a lot of sense to me at first but after using the app it was a well thought out way to go. A simple points calculator would be helpful so I don't have to leave the app to get to my other calculator and I'd like to see a notification icon telling me how many points/calories I have left for the day but these are extras that would be nice but are not necessary. The quality of this app makes me excited to see what they do with the updates as they perfect their already great design.",

I liked that you could customize it to work with whatever diet you are on.  So when Lifesum kept pushing to upgrade, I thought, ""it is the New Year. Why not?""  I anticipated that the Gold version would be even that much better. It is NOT!   Adding food and snacks to this app is a nightmare. User-friendly it is not. I even tried to edit ""My Food"" on my computer by logging into the program via the internet.  It was no more helpful. In fact, it was a little bit more frustrating doing it that way. I do like how it imports my data from my Jawbone Up app &  how it relays information to the Jawbone app. It is very frustrating that there is no quick way to add food. I noticed that even when I scan the food items, the information uploaded to the app is incorrect.

The positive part of the app is that it integrates the Apple Watch and the tracking feature works well. I could have gotten that from the free version however. The paid version gives you a few recipes and a bit more nutritional information about your food. The app is designed to make tracking an obsessive behavior, which is great for those trying to achieve their health and fitness goals.

Being able to track everything on a device I carry anyway was a huge difference maker for me. Quickly realized I was not eating enough on my workout days and over compensating on the rest days. Also does a great job keeping me honest on the weekends. Every improvement I can think of such as coordinating with say Subway to put all their data in is probably beyond the price. I usually end up manually putting in one meal a day so overall I spend 10-15 minutes a day which is way less than I exercise, but those are the minutes that are making a difference for me on the scale.",

For one, the app randomly changes my date of birth for no reason. No big deal, but it also will change important things. For example, on Friday it'll say that I can eat 1200 calories. Then on Saturday it'll say that my Friday calories went way over the limit - I was actually supposed to only eat 1000! There are a lot more bugs, like not registering changes I make to my personal details, not syncing properly with the web site, and this one really small but irritating thing it'll do in the search, wherein I'll type a search query and then try to go back to change it, it'll delete the whole query automatically and force me to type it again. Pretty sure that's what the ""x"" on the right side of the search bar is for. Anyway, until the MYRIAD bugs get fixed, it's more irritating to use than anything.",

Then, when I go to scan barcode, or search for the food, the food item does not show up on the list!!! 2) after successful food entry, I go to the webpage and the numbers dont match up?? For example, I go and add some Russell Stover’s sugar free candies, and instead of the calories reading 210 for 3 pieces, the total shows 99 calories/3 pieces, and all my macros show as decimals??

They want you to eat healthily, not less, because they give you how many carbs, and how much fat and protein you've had that day. They have it automatically set to a certain amount, but if you don't feel that's how many carbs you should be eating, or how many cups of water you should drink, you can change that! There's even help for gaining weight. I don't like the grading system, but I can ignore that. This app isn't magic, you have to have discipline and patience to enter everything you eat, but it works.

It grades my meals and tells me what to do to improve my food choices, helps me find recipes and able to save my own, I have been using the app for a little over 2 months and have lost 15lbs. This was with no extra exercise, just diet! I'm also a breastfeeding mom and I appreciate that it allows me to add to my calorie allowance to account for the extra that I need.",

I really love how it has the scanner and adjusts you calorie amount for the day based on what you eat. I really like the tips that describe the effects and stages of what diet your on each day. I was so excite when I saw it tested me to see which diet is good for me based on my wants and needs. I gave four stars because the scanner is a bit wonky and they need to expand the food from groceries stores like publix, Whole Foods and popular restaurants. The scanner usually is okay but sometimes it refuses to recognize basic food like a potato. Overall thought I think this app is going to be life changing for me and I'm hoping to lose 30-40 pounds with life sum!",

The interface has a great aesthetic and the overall brand has a high-end feel to it vs my FitPal.  After playing with the free version I opted to pay for the full version to get a more personalized plan and recipes.  That where my disappointment came.  While I loved the questions to find a right plan for you.  The recipes are very intricate and not family friendly if you have small kids.  Not only that, but there are only a handful of recipes to pick from.  Add the fact I don't eat pork, and the list is cut even smaller. It does seem there's a bit of a rotation to a few.  And at least half look delicious.  If you're a foodie looking to get healthy.  Or don't have the constraints of super busy evenings and early bedtimes, this may be a good app for you.  I really wish you could see a sample of even like 3 recipes with the free version.  It would have saved me $50 for an app I'll never use.",

The only reason why I marked it down one star was because I really want to be able to change the amount of calories I intake per day.  I think this app should allow you to either choose the amount of calories you plan on eating or how long you want it to take for you to get to your goal weight.  This would  be cool because if you chose how many calories you plan on eating each day, Ishape would tell you how long it will take you to to get to the goal weight.  Also, if you choose how long you want it to take you, it could tell you how many calories to eat.  What if I don't want to lose 2 pounds per week?

For instance, personal meals entered on iPhone show up on the previous day on BOTH the iPhone and the website (but individual personal food items do seem to work ok going from iPhone to OLD website.)

On the home page I can see my calories and exercise and everything but the lifestyle section is screwed up.  My average does not include my new info AND when I add new weight data it doesn't show up on the bar.  This didn't star happening until today.

I'd pay if I could search a food library like in MyFitnessPal, especially since you guys have cool things like choosing your own diet, in a pleasing-to-look-at app. HOWEVER, having to pay to sync my Fitbit (which I already paid money for) is beyond ridiculous when (you guessed it) MyFitnessPal does syncing for free.

I was super psyched to have finally found an app that counts calories and has a nice UI but then the app started to screw with me... Literally within the same day. Apparently, I am supposed to be consuming -238 calories for snack... How am I supposed to do that? Plus, research has shown that snacking throughout the day (with healthy foods) is good for you! Also, the measurements are weird and I wasn't the only one to notice that (I saw another complaint above). I wish there was a way to turn off criticisms and just count calories! I'm not by any means overweight and the app seems to be telling me to become skin and bones because of how it rates my portions! I know it may seem like I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to portions but I assure you there is no reason to be limiting myself like this for an app.",

Well selected my meal plan and all it did was basically tell me my option was selected. Didn't give me meal plan or even meal ideas. Just gave me a picture of random food I could eat for every meal. There are seven days in a week. What the hell am I supposed to do with three ideas and some of the food is not in season or I wouldn't eat? They give you a teaser of three meals when you are doing your daily log but again that's it! I paid for something that got me nothing. A word of advice, do not pay for the gold.

The one problem is that the goals they want you to reach are virtually impossible. I eat very well, what I would consider to be average-healthy. This app basically tells me to eat raw protein powder for every meal. If I input that I ate whole grain toast with Nutella and strawberries (pretty healthy I would say) it gives me a frowny face because I was supposed to eat 30g of protein. The amount of some of the nutrients it expects you to eat are actually unhealthy. The recipes they give you are not easy. They involve buying very specific health related ingredients only found at some stores. The only reason I use this app now is for tracking how much water I drink. I think you guys should really re-evaluate what is considered healthy and what is considered excessive. Make the goals more reachable for an average human.",Thanks for the feedback!

It's definitly helped me keep better track of my caloric intake and burning.  I thought I was doing ok with pen and paper, but I would forget sometimes to write things down -- this is so easy, I have stuck to it without a problem.  The updates with this new version are great.  CONS:  It only saves 7 days (bad!!) and there is no way to email/save the data.  I work with a personal trainer and I don't have anyway to give him a copy of my log and it's hard for me to look back to see my progression week over week and analyze.  Please FIX!

The one good thing about this is the food database it has; it's very extensive. However, in terms of workouts it lacks - A LOT. Some of the most frustrating things are the way it logs workouts. You can ONLY use time and not sets, reps, weight - the main things I was wanting to use this for and figured that it would be there considering they do have workouts you can select from. It is only helpful if you are doing cardio. Other than that I would strongly recommend you pass and get the free app ""Lose It!"" which does the same thing but its FREE.",

BIG + is being able to start over and erase profile. I downloaded this a few versions back and used it for a while then kinda got off the bandwagon. Well, I am back on and it's great to be able to have a fresh start with this app. Food library is great. I did notice with this latest version when you add a food it won't let you scroll all the way down to enter sodium and fiber. Also, the custom minutes on exercise is not working quite right. Hopefully these minor bugs will be fixed so they work right again. These developers are doing a great job and I expect them to keep up the good work!",

I switched from MFP after they added the gaudy Under Armour logo to the app icon. The design and functionality is great and it's very easy to add food and recipes. The one problem I have is that when making food, you're locked in when you try to add the serving size. For example, I added peanut butter whose serving size is 2 tablespoons. I could select different units like cups or teaspoons but it would only let me have the serving as one unit like ""1 tablespoon"" or ""1 cup."" This isn't a huge deal for this, I just cut the nutrition in half but there are plenty of times where this becomes inconvenient like when the serving is ""11 crackers"" or ""6 ounces.""",
3214,3,2015-10-23T00:22:28.000Z,emma_stone,Really good start to a great app,"The app is so easy to use and very helpful in tracking meals and exercises for diets. It could use a lot of upgrading though. More diet plans would be nice, such as vegan and paleo as options instead of the standard, ketogenic, and 5:2. It also needs a A LOT more food tracking options. I can barely find some of the foods when I eat out if they're on there at all, or even basic foods that I eat at home. Also the suggested recipes could be a little easier for us cooking challenged folks. I don't have easy access to obscure ingredients and it's hard to tell how to substitute them for the recipes I really want to make. Most of them are labeled as ""medium difficulty"" but I wouldn't be able to make them if I have a culinary degree. Very great potential for this app, if only it was about 3 years more mature.",
3215,3,2016-04-16T00:28:14.000Z,Sarah's thoughts,Food log/input should improve,"This app needs to get it together/ generally make the food log better. It's great that we can see brands, but it's really hard to input things that are not logged as brand items. For example, today I had a bacon egg and cheese breakfast Sandwich on an English muffin. I typed that in and no results would come up. I searched just ""breakfast sandwich"" and it was mostly all Starbucks entries or other random things but not any homemade or prepared food items to select. I ended up just logging each piece of this food separately, which I find myself doing pretty often.",

However, something bugy has happened with accessing the food database when off line. I've always been able to access the data base when off line but all of sudden I can't seem to do that anymore. I'm not sure if an update with fix the problem but if it doesn't then it's really worthless to me. I travel internationally a lot and mojority of my time is not around easily accesseble WiFi. There are other quirky things that many of the users find frustrating but I've been able to do a work around with those, and having been an avid user since 2014, I'd say up until now it was the best diet up, regardless.",

I did it for about 3 days, was super happy with it, then quit doing it because it took a lot of effort for a busy person like me, then started again a few days ago. It has helped me a lot overall. Another issue I have with it is that it has so many plans and recipes, but only premium members can use most of them. I have to pay for the food that it tells me I should eat to be healthier or reach my daily goal, and paying for premium is too much for me. Overall I think it's a great app that helps a lot, but there should be more options for free members.",

It breaks down the nutritional components for the most part. You can choose calorie count or not, that is great there are options/choices. What I do notice is the app will freeze at time where you have to log out wait a few and the log back in to put your information in.

The graphs are great and I live the tracking tools. But, the app doesn't follow Apple's standards and it is extremely difficult to use. The touch screen is very unresponsive in this program, and there is no blinking cursor to inform the user where try are typing. This, and about a million other bugs, makes this app very hard to use. Many times I will click on a touch region and it won't respond. I have been having these problems since I bought the app months ago and they haven't been fixed. Also, the database could have more foods and it would be cool if it could track points. I love the idea an without bugs it would be 5 stars. The bugs are just so bad that it affects usability. P.S.

Whenever I input a meal it will not show up until I force quit the app and reopen. About once a day, all of my data will disappear and the only thing that brings it back is restarting the phone.

Not to mention, they also say in their ad that you can cancel this subscription at any time, but that is awesome misleading and untrue because there is no option available for you to cancel it. And even if I was able to cancel it I doubt that I would see a penny of my money back.

I found that if I search a meal or food item to add, there aren't a lot of choices and most often I can't find what I'm looking for. This being the case, I can't add this to my daily meals, thus negating the usefulness of this app. I am also very disappointed in the rating system in that I could have multiple A items but it equals out to a D or E because of the total calories. I feel like the rating should be based on healthy choices and not the number of calories, seeing as I could eat nothing but raw vegetables and still get a low grade.

Deleted the others. And lost 20 pounds so far. They make it easy to make intelligent food choices, even when eating out with friends, by putting all the data about your options right in front of you! And the recipes have been the real time saver. They really understand the different diets and push recipes to you that fit your diet, unlike the other apps that are totally calorie-centric (and completely untrustworthy for carb-sensitive people).

I'm not going to take the time to input all the products that aren't in the database, and the ones close to what I have seen strangely too healthy. It would be great to have more features that build custom meals in a less round-about way and an expanded database. Having a feature that recognizes nutrition fact stickers would be amazing.

It also keeps track of what you eat by entering in the name or scan the barcode and just hit The button and it'll calculate all the calories you had for that meal. It'll tell you if you've had too many or too little calories for that day and it will also keep track of how much water you drink by just tapping on a little picture of a glass.",
3238,5,2017-02-20T05:43:30.000Z,Cyounger404,Really helps with weight loss,"I invested the yearly/ monthly fee in this app expecting it to help me loose weight. Well it did and I am 60 pounds lighter. There was a girl in my college English class that I liked, but I was 287lbs so I had no chance. Three months later I seen her and said hi and stuff, but that's about it. That night she started texting me and now we're going on our first date.",

3240,2,2015-08-20T02:02:57.000Z,Hobo schmoe,Needs work,"When I first got this app it was decent. I'm not too hot on the fact that it only shows active calories on the main screen next to consumed calories. It would be nice to have all calories (resting plus active) so I can quickly see where I'm at calories in/out instead of having to look up my resting and do the math myself. The biggest problem though, and this is a more redent one, which has caused me to cancel my subscription is the glitch that resets a lot of my food entries. I enter my dinner and the app says 1 serving = 300 cal then I go back to check it later and it says 1 serving = 1 cal. So I constantly have to reenter food in creative ways in order for the calories to be correct (ie 300 servings/300 cal). That's if I can remember what the nutrition facts were on the frozen dinner I had a few hours ago.",
3241,4,2016-02-27T09:06:47.000Z,anymouse88,I use it everyday as a tool.,"This is a great app. I use it to track my intake and outputs. Highly recommend using with a Fitbit or similar unit though, because you are constantly burning calories, not just when you're exercising. My favorite part of the app is the database of foods and the bar scanner tool. It's good for keeping track of caloric consumption and how much fluid you drink. But it changes the calorie limit depending on how much you exercise which can be misleading or confusing. I like that you can add unlisted foods. I also like that you can add your own exercise activity and calories burned, but you can't put how many minutes spent on that exercise. (It always just says 1 minute).",
3242,3,2016-05-05T21:52:56.000Z,Steleoj4eva,IMMENSE LACK OF EXERCISES,"The variety of exercises is very thin. Also, the search engine on the app could be better. You have only one thigh machine, even though there are at least 8 that I know of. I'm sure they all burn different amounts of calories. Bicycle kicks not on the app; no planking, amazing exercise & still not on your app! Lying leg lifts? No. Flutter kicks? No. Leg raises? No. Russian twist? No. Plank kick throughs? No. Plank knee to elbow? No. It's really concerning the amount of exercises not on your app. CHEST PRESS!? How can you not have something so fundamental? Shoulder press, different variations of squats, back extensions, other back exercises.",

For the past 8 days my Fitbit wouldn't sync because of a server error. I emailed them about it and they replied back almost immediately saying that they're working on it already. Not only that, they went beyond what most companies do when the problem is minor and emailed me again saying ""Hey, it's working now. Here's how to connect Fitbit again."" I'm pretty impressed!",
3244,4,2017-01-05T06:18:24.000Z,jessiuss,Pretty good,"Pretty visuals, very interactive. Theres a couple of text errors when you pick the gain weight option, like they added it in on a whim and didnt change all the text. The plan survey was... what?? Most of the questions were unintelligible the rest were not applicable to what i was trying to do.. but whatever about that. The database is pretty big and im not worried about being 100% accurate with my calories so i just put in approximates. Id really like a tutorial on like, what an ounce of food looks like, or like how much is an average glass, idk but i dont know that stuff. But it wasn't that hard to look it up.  Uh yea ive only been using it 2 days but no big complaints so far.",
3245,5,2017-02-01T05:59:55.000Z,neon_simba,Amazing Fitness App!,I love this app and have been a premium member for more than a year. The team continuously makes the app better every month and actually listens to user feedback on what could be improved on. It's super easy to log what I eat during the week and be able to balance it out with my workouts. Some of my favorite features include a useful(though somewhat limited) recipe book and the seamless integration with Apple Health Kit and other smart health products(such as my withings scale). This app is extremely easy to use and I encourage anyone who needs help getting fit to definitely try it out! Thanks Lifesum Team!,

The only complaint I do have is sometimes the specific items listed do not have accurate nutritional information (Ex. A certain brand of something says 1 cup has X amount of calories, but it actually has Y amount of calories per cup). And fixing the inaccurate information is a process because you have to report it and it has to be approved before it is changed. Highly recommend this app, though. Keep improving it and it will be huge in no time.",
3248,3,2017-05-04T15:16:26.000Z,Jessums,Love it buuuuuut...,UPDATE: I've been using this app for almost a year and it really is a great tool to measure how much activity I do throughout the day and to utilize as a food diary.,Please add your suggestions to our uservoice forum here: https://lifesum.uservoice.com/forums/274566-feedback-ideas

But as college is want to do, I got lazy and gained roughly 50 lbs (Mostly primanti bros and chipotle, had the munchies like woe). Now I weigh 224 lbs, down from 230 and I started two days ago. I've been trying to get back to 190 but to no avail because I lose track of what I eat.",
3251,5,2015-06-22T03:38:36.000Z,Billybob2chainz,Great option for everyone,"Best part about this app is that it's not specifically for people who are trying to lose weight like most other apps like this are. There are options for everyone, whether you ARE trying to lose weight, maintain your weight but eat healthier, or even gain weight (muscle mass). Also, there are so many options for different foods you can put in to your log, including brand names so you know that the macro count is accurate. I recommend this app to anyone who wishes to track their eating habits! Remember, workouts won't get you anywhere without the proper meal plan!",

However I would like more options and customization when it comes to setting goals and counting macros. Sometimes the diet and percentages don't match the goals Im trying to reach and would like to set my macros in grams per day. Also would like a tab to view the entire day and sum of all the macro and micro nutrients like myfitnesspal does so I know how many macros I have, or don't have left.",
3253,5,2016-03-01T02:27:14.000Z,Eman's son,Fantastic,"I have used Lifesum for quite a while now and just loved how it is set up. I switched to MyPlate because I heard some hype about it, but found even with its features it just isn't nearly as nice as Lifesum. Lifesum is simple, easy to navigate, and has just enough on it to tell you what you need without clouding up the dashboard with things you don't want. It has nearly every exercise already on it (though I found when I input my climbing the calorie burned count seems high).  This app is amazing! If you need a macronutrient tracker or a calorie counter or a fitness tracker, use Lifesum! 100% recommended!",
3254,3,2016-04-19T17:17:27.000Z,Lauuurennn,Things to fix in next update,"This app has a lot of positive qualities and great potential. I have had a lot of success losing weight since this app sets a daily caloric intake goal for you based on your current weight, your goal weight, and the amount of time you want to lose the weight in. I also like being able input recipes and meals that I make often so they're easy to track. There is also a good database of foods and their calories.",
3255,4,2017-01-05T23:48:02.000Z,Made2k,Good but with inaccurate food info,The app so far seems great. I wanted to get this to try and eat healthier in general and also have a way to see nutritional info for things I'm eating so I can take insulin for all the combined ingredients (I'm a type 1 diabetic).,
3256,4,2017-03-16T00:00:23.000Z,Hannah Bircher,Mostly satisfied,"It is a great and thorough app. Lots of features and plans. You can track water, exercise, food. It helps you set goals and it also tells you how you are doing at each meal and how to improve. It also has a quiz that shows you what you eat enough of and what you need to intake more or cut out. I have premium and it's $45 for the year which is cheaper than fitness pal. I think this app is better than fitness pal by far.",

At first you had to add everything yourself and the app crashed often or was slow, but I've been delighted to find that every time I pick it up again it just works better. The copy from previous day is a dream and I love typing in recipes and having calories per serving automatically calculated -- saves guessing from similar foods on the web. Plus, the app is speedy and hasn't crashed in a long time. Thanks for continuing development and making this a great, reliable app that keeps getting easier to use!",

It's (VERY) easy to use which is great and it has a lot of food and exercise options which is great because all you have to do is look up the food, and click on it, it counts the calories for you! And he exercise options are great, especially with sports practices, because it has a lot of options like if I did easy, medium, or a hard workout!

So I'm thinking, ""No problem,  I'll get a membership.  $3/month is doable.""  Come to find out it's $9/month unless you buy 12 months.  Ridiculous!  This is my favorite of all the food logging apps but what is up with the ridiculous price tag?  I like getting grades for my meals although I feel like it wasn't always accurate.  There is also a problem with the accuracy of the food that I would scan in.  I was constantly having to double check that the calories and servings were right.  I'll probably go back to my fitness pal or 'lose it'.  Too bad because I like this interface the best.",

I do like that this app has recipes and a specific plan based upon you desired goals. I do feel that there's a good amount of features though that you must pay for which is quite upsetting. Just to track my measurements I have to pay, yet my fitness pal, I can do all of that. I do wish there was a way to customize your water intake. I maybe not finish all my water and prefer to just input the correct dose. I do love the smiley faces next to the each food and for each meal, as well as, the recommended calories for each meal.",

It's been so helpful, so easy and Kees me motivated. I've struggled with counting calories before. It made me feel super restricted but this app somehow makes me feel in control and makes me want to stay on track to reach my goals. I love tracking my food as crazy as that may sound!

I still have some ways to go, but it is completely worth the time and effort. Although, I never did use the premium packaging because I cannot afford it, I do believe that this app has truly changed how I feel about my eating habits. If there is anyone reading this who feels nervous or humiliated about the awkwardness of using a fitness app, don't. It will get more natural and easier the longer you use it, so don't be worried.","Congratulations on that awesome progress, and thank you for the nice review 😊"

The GUI is great, it responds nicely, works as promised, and they have just added a *HUGE* online database of food. Yes, I no longer have to skip over foods because I don't feel like typing in the nutritional facts myself! How great is that? Searching for words like ""Stuffing"" and ""pot roast"" will bring up numerous choices that you can chose from, then once you pick the one you want, you can add it to your database with one click. It works seemlessly over the 3G, great app. Let's lose some weight!",
3272,4,2016-02-09T04:03:20.000Z,whatmakesmesmile,Great...but you  can tell it's a new app,"It's a great idea, love it much more than lose it, but like everyone has said, the system has a lot of flaws that seem weird for an app that looks as good as this one does. Biggest issue because it's crucial to what the app is for: Because portion sizes are really confusing to set when you add a food, calorie values are just all over the place. If I hadn't been tracking calories so long I would have no clue how many calories is actually in anything. Finally, navigating is a bit tedious, even when entering food. If they can work on the above this app will be in a much better place.",

Adding food is a bit tricky at times but this is the best attempt by an app I've seen thus far. My only issue is the subscription options. I'm not one to sign up for monthly plans. Especially via the App Store. I like to purchase in blocks or buy 1 time and done. I also wish they would offer the first month or 2 for free. I can't see the full potential of the app until I buy it for a month. If they offered the first month free, I probably would have loved it so much that I would have subscribed. IMO.

You can document your meals consisting of raw food (fruits, eggs, etc), homemade meals (honey balsamic chicken with broccoli and cheese), and even dining out!  They make it so quick and easy to keep track; there is even a barcode scanner for expedited food entry.  Props!  You also get recommendations for items that would benefit your diet, such as adding peanuts or a specific protein like fish.  It's like having a professional nutritionist right at your fingertips!",

Even better, it syncs seamlessly with apple health kit, and also provides a range of nutrition plans (they are not ""diets"") to choose from to help you reach your own goals!

I like the ability to see the breakdown of fat/carb/protein and set goals for yourself based on these values.

The catch is though, that in order to unlock all of the recipes, I had to upgrade to the gold version. BIG mistake! Logging anything is difficult. It's nearly impossible to get accurate food portions or even exercises for that matter.  There's some type of arbitrary grading system that makes no sense whatsoever. On top of that, I haven't gotten any new recipes! I can't believe I bought a year-long subscription to be told how to put avocado on toast everyday.  The most disappointing part is once I paid for my subscription, I'm stuck with it for the full term. There's no way to cancel it until it's over. Save your money!",

It also offers the option to help with eating healthier and getting leaner.

I have waited two months to write this review so I really hope you take my advice and look no further for another diet program.",

It's just how am I supposed to know how much of something I ate? Oh well, it's still good to keep track and useful for developing better eating habits. Especially once you realize what you've been cramming into your face hole. Another great thing about this app worth mentioning is the fact that it also has a lot of the different brands of certain foods too. I really recommend this app, it's very worth while and worth a try. Give it a chance!",

It reminds me to stay hydrated as well. You can also track your exercises and it will change your macros based on exercise. The only problem is that it doesn't have all the exercises you would do in the gym, but I usually assume all chest workouts under the ""push-ups"" category. Also negatively, you have to pay to be able to track all the micro-nutrients.",

I work on the computer a lot but I'm also physically active, this app makes eating good well-balanced diet a lot easier. It helps, it has become such a habit and helps me keep on top of my calorie and nutrient intake. I highly recommend Lifesum if you want to step away from eating so much processed or junk foods, the food ratings make decisions a lot easier and helps reaffirm my food choices throughout the day.",

You can see your macronutrients, calories and foods for the day. Very easy to find any foods you have eaten in their database. Also LOVE that they give you an option to be on meal plans and rank your day based on the plan. For example, I eat low carb so I'm on their Keto diet program that way it tells me when I've eaten too many carbs. Most apps will only tell you the standard American diet recommendations, but this one has multiple options! Highly recommend!",
3297,5,2017-05-23T04:41:40.000Z,_belinds_,Great and beautiful app,I think this app is awesome because it holds my attention and the design is something I enjoy looking at everyday (unlike myfitnesspal). My only complaint is that the inventory of food they have is quite poor. I've noticed that entries done by real users are not accurate and then get circulated around. Example: There is a sweet potato entry that at 0 grams is over 2000 calories! Clearly incorrect... with that being said this app is great and I use everyday! Super easy to customize the setting to your needs without upgrading to premium.,

It gets me to drink more and eat more vegetables and fish. However, it crashes multiple times a day for me. It will not allow me to input food for the next day, as it puts that food on the current day. It's so frustrating. Also, recently it is not correctly searching for food products that it has brought up in the past. I am very disappointed. With each bug fix, these problems get worse. In fact, ever since I started paying for it, I have had more issues than before paying. I will continue to use it since I paid for 3 months, but at this time I absolutely cannot recommend it.  Use any other app.",The fix has just been launched. Please update your app and check if you are still experiencing any issues. Thank you very much!

You can usually fudge it by putting the components of what you ate into the log separately.  Just takes a little more time. However, I will say that the ability to track what you are eating really helps.  That extra piece of cake, nope, gonna push me over the limit.  I think that the new update and the ability to add foods will add to the utility of the program.   It might sound fussy, but no olive oil, really...

Not only does it let you keep a calendar that tracks points and daily percentages for you (with some effort), it also allows you to search an online database and save submissions as favorites.  Then, you just need to add that favorite to your daily food list.  I also like the weight tracker with added charts to see how you have progressed.  It even lets you add exercise points, though adding the info yourself is sometimes necessary.  I have found that this app works great alongside the free iPoints app, which allows you to calculate points based on calories, fat and fiber.  Definately worth the money if you are serious about losing weight.",

I was down 5lbs by the end of week 1. Not because I did anything out of the ordinary, I just kept better track of what I was putting in my body.

The fact that there are friends on Lifesum helps keep us motivated to log, and we can each other's food. if they didn't log, we sent each other reminders to do so. Our first day on Lifesum we were surprised on how many calories we usually eat and got many E and D ratings!!! Long story short, I lost 9 pounds in 4 weeks! Get this app if you don't already.",

But needs ironing out.,"Lifesum has helped me to be more conscious of my eating habits, and gives me a greater sense of how many calories I am eating. However, the Apple Watch app doesn't always keep up with the iOS app; for example when I track water and exercise in the iOS app, the Watch app shows that haven't had any water and have not exercised at all! I'm not sure why this happens but it is a bit frustrating. There is a lot of potential in Lifesum, I suggest that the developers keep at it!

I have it synced to Apple health for steps, and on the day I walked 8000 steps, the app told me I burned about 200 calories. Then, the next day when my phone only recorded 2000 steps, the app said I burned 500. 2. I have been trying to record my daily weights, but instead of adding it into the chart as a new weight, it changes the starting weight. 3. The faces seem to have no correlation to the food I eat. It told me that grilled zucchini was bad but rice is ok? I'm debating whether to keep using this app or just switch to another one.",Thanks for getting in touch.

Apparently i ate nothing yesterday  and what a actually ate yesterday it says i ate the day before. And it has doubled everything i have eaten. It's all on there twice so it messed up my averages and my goal date. And so i deleted it and redownloaded it hoping it would fix it but then it pushed everything back another day. So with the original day and this one everything is two days off.  And if i try to delete one of the doubles the next time i open it both the double and the one i left are gone.

However, I think there could be some improvement with tracking food. I think you should be able to quick add calories and carbs and protein so that if you go out to lunch and look up the nutrition, and they don't have it on the app, you can still track it. Also, the exercises could use some improvement. I like to track everything with my workout, like how many lunges I do and with what weight. That exercise is not on here, and it doesn't give me an option to create my own like My Fitness Pal does.",

It's improved so much since its last update. My only concern is the lack in the food library. I've been using other resources to create my own foods and it doesn't have enough diversity in cuisine. Also, the built in step tracker is very inaccurate, which doesn't bother me as much because I have my own pedometer.

I like that this app has macro-nutrient info as well as calorie info.

You set a goal, tells you how healthy the food you add is, and tracks your calories intake but gets annoying if you eat the same thing everyday and have to search for the same food. It would be helpful if they add a ""favorite"" list or an easier way to add the food you eat on a daily basis. Overall it's worth it if you have a little time to add your diet and info.

It syncs to the health app which will keep your weight and steps.  You can add exercise and activities which allows your to see what calories you have burned through the day.  The scanning tool is great for home as you prepare meals.  I would highly recommend this app for anyone looking for a easy and simple to use for beginning to get healthier!,

It appears that the Health app is syncing days from my Apple Watch and iPhone. There has to be a way to only count my Apple Watch the way MyFitnessPal does. I purchased the premium version of this app in October because I love having food plans. However ever since the update I'm frustrated that Lifesum is over-counting my calories and making it hard for me to leverage the great things about the app and making me do double the work by figuring out which exercise values I should be using. I would like to see a fix soon because I really do love this app when it works well.,
3354,5,2017-01-10T15:45:59.000Z,Tatiana11xo,User friendly.,"This makes dieting so much easier. Calorie counting, macro counting, clean eating, whatever you're into this makes it easier to do. Also helps you see how big potions should be. I love how it helps me keep track of my meals and what areas need improvement. One downside is that once you add your exercise it recalculates your goal for the day and that throws me off so now i do not add exercise and that helps me stay on track. Otherwise i love this app!",

No other app comes close to what they have done. The point of a food diary is to want to use it to become more aware of what your eating. Lifesum has accomplished this for users. At this time the app is ill for anyone with Apple iOS 10.3.1.,That is very odd! Please contact us at contact@lifesum.com and we will help you out!

Was already on the fence since so much of the data and motivation is focused on losing weight, no matter how I set it up. I don't want to lose weight, I'm working more towards a holistic process for pain management, taking into count WHAT I eat and how it can relate to pain/inflammation. It also seems to only share some data with the iPhone Health app. May try again with an updated version, but will keep looking for the right app.","Thanks for your review!

To lose one pound a week, calculate your BMR (basal metabolic rate) and input your desired cals per day. Easy-peasy. Weight Watchers? Never tried, never will. Don't need it.

I do like the diet plans, the meal grades, the look and feel, and the way they make carb and calorie recommendations by meal. But until the bugs are worked out its not useable.",

The setup is great as well. The major downfall is the discrepancy in the food stats. For example, this morning I logged a fiber bar and the app says it was 120 calories when the box says it is 140. This can make a big difference in your results when it happens on a regular basis. Hopefully they will work it out so that the app is accurate because the app is really well done otherwise.",

One concern is that the calories burned from steps (synced from Health) vary wildly from day to day. One day may be 2000 steps and 888 calories burned while another will be 6000 steps and 31 calories burned. It is inconsistent and inaccurate. This should be addressed. I will echo others concerns with inability to add foods and exercises. You must rely on logged activities with questionable calories burned, or food with fishy nutritional info.

Most importantly you can't set your macronutrient goals, so if Lifesum thinks you should have 35% carbs there's nothing you can do about it. Also their product data base is much worse and less accurate than MyFitnessPal's. Lastly, it doesn't always make sense, like when each individual meal is under my protein target for that meal, yet I am over my protein target for the day. It's a shame such a nicely designed interface is going to waste.",

Lately, the app nonstop has crashed either right when I open it, when I'm trying to update my food diary, or just 30 seconds after I open it. If I go back to the app or close and reopen the app the same thing happens. I can't do anything on it now because it's so buggy, but when it's not, it's a great app.",
3396,5,2016-12-05T03:30:13.000Z,Babvkitten,Love it!!,I recommend this to all my friends looking to eat more healthily! It's so great at getting you to alter what you eat to be better for your body with the way it grades you. The key to benefiting from the app is logging what you're going to eat before you eat so you have time to rethink your choices if they generate a low grade. Overall I find the app much more health oriented than other similar apps.,

The food database is off by a tiny bit at times, and I try to help by correcting info or adding new products. The app is beautifully designed and easy to use. One thing that is kind of bothering me is the fact that they push premium features too strong. I would like to get premium but I don't think the price is worth it. Overall great app, recommend it 100%!",

I love that you can set your own custom plan and goal calorie intake, etc. My complaint is that I wish upgrading was only a one time payment and not a monthly payment, it's way too much. Because of that, I can't upgrade to premium, and premium adds SOO much more to the app but unfortunately I can't get it I would love to get all the custom recipes and extra tracking features.",Thanks a lot for your feedback and the nice review!

You can look at you statistics and even plan meals for the future.  Its not just a diet app.  You can also keep track of your exercise, too.  If what you did is not in the library, simply add it just like you would for foods.  This is a great app for those who would like to get(me) or stay in shape.",

I guess that just means free members just can't make mistakes, then (which is stupid; if I'm trying to track my kcal intake and exercise amount I'd expect to at least be able to change errors as a just in case, not be forced to pay for an account to do so... or maybe this site gives so little features that they have to lock out editing as an incentive to gain more customers; either way they lost this user)",
3402,2,2015-06-20T17:09:50.000Z,Abit-ti-tar,Awful for tracking carbs,A lot of the carb counts are wrong. This is a very big deal if counting carbs. So with those wrong I question everything and have to look at other sources so I end up not using the app for that. It also has lots of names brand and restaurant food. Which makes looking up just basic raw food you cook or prepare at home a chore. If you already do not eat processed foods and rarely eat out this app becomes tiresome. On a good note they said they would refund my gold account since I contacted them right away and the one good thing I like is drunk water reminders.,
3403,2,2016-01-01T16:51:37.000Z,bmac981,Waste of time,"Thought this would be a great way to kick of a healthy eating plan for the new year, then found out that more than half of all useful information was behind a pay wall. Also when you add an item, it also puts half the info you put in behind the paywall too. You can't even view nutrition info that YOU PUT IN. Also when I scan a barcode, app says it's not in the db but after I spend time entering all the info, it says it already exists! So frustrating! Two stars for app and UI design only. Functionality usefulness is next to nothing.",
3404,5,2016-05-05T20:04:38.000Z,Zesty wings,Great app that could be more!,Really love the app! It really gives a visual way of tracking calories and your diet rather than having to just put numbers. I was maybe thinking of adding a budgeting part of the app because we all know how costly it can be to eat healthy. So adding maybe a price range or just by putting how much each meal cost could be a benefit to healthy living and saving money.,
3405,5,2016-07-22T21:41:59.000Z,Bigdogs83,Love it,Life sum really helps me stay on track.  It has you take a quiz and configures a diet plan that works for you. I like how it encourages me with little reminders throughout the day to drink more water and if you haven't been very active.  I so far have lost about 20 # in about a month,
3406,1,2016-08-16T13:11:34.000Z,AbraxasTrevor,Do not pay for this app.,"Not worth the money at all. The # of recipes is laughable and you're better off just using Yummly. The meal and day rating system is generic (not tailored to the plan you're on as is implied during the sales pitch, very vague and not helpful). The scan barcode feature to register food items almost never has the food items in the system and in the rare event it does the nutritional facts are always wrong. I have to spend a ridiculous amount of time manually inputting the nutritional facts for each ingredient I use. Basically, you are paying to build up the database for them. Very unhappy customer.",
3407,5,2016-09-04T00:03:52.000Z,Hsjskdhso,Love it,"Great app. Very useful and I love the barcode scanner and daily calorie counter that keep you on the right track for your goals. Only downside is that if you want to keep it free, you have to deal with TONS of ads telling you to get the paid app not only in the app but through emails as well. It would be much smoother without the ads but I'm not paying monthly just for those to go away.",
3408,5,2017-03-20T16:46:32.000Z,Kass❤️❤️,So Helpful!!,I have been using this app for a couple of weeks now and it has been very helpful to my weight loss journey! I have it automatically paired with my Apple Watch and it tracks my movements throughout the day. I also love how you get a rating on each of your meals and the day by what foods you've ate or if you've hit your calorie goal! Overall a very useful app ans would highly recommend,
3409,4,2017-04-10T15:35:58.000Z,APinks9088561,A little misleading but good overall,"I'm a health nut who fell off the wagon and desperately looking to get back on so I will admit I'm a little more critical than the average user. Overall, it's great. However, I wish there were more opportunities for customization without having to pay so much. Also, confused as to how eating an apple for a snack is off track, especially when it also gave me the goal of eating 3 servings of fruit a day, tracked by icons shaped like apples?",
3410,5,2008-08-17T20:14:56.000Z,BlueStone01,Great iPhone app!!,Bought this app today after viewing iShape's excellent video...  i particularly like the ability to enter favorites and customized food entries... by itself the food items list is the perfect tool for those who shun pre-packaged and prepared foods in favor of maintaining a whole-foods diet... much better than the other app i tried with a built-in food nutrition database which was based mostly on packaged foods.,
3411,3,2009-01-11T20:21:41.000Z,old_school1960,good but...,Good but not exactly what I was hoping for.  It would be nice to have more freedom to just enter caloric intake on some items rather than to have to estimate oz's etc. till I get close to the actual calorie amount.  I keep close tabs on what I am eating - and watch labels.  I would be able to enter more precisely what i've eaten if the app allowed.,
3412,5,2009-03-30T21:09:47.000Z,Jusco,Works great!,I've used it for about a month now and it works great. It all depends on how much you're willing to put into it. It can be a bit tiring putting in how many calories you eat every meal but it's eye opening when you realize just how many calories certain foods have.,

And its reoccurring payments but there isn't anyway to turn off automatic payments on the app.  I would rather have a free trial before fully committing to something I've never used. I would however like if the app had a lifetime buy. Where you pay for it once and that's it. I don't want to pay for months or years. I would like it if they made a free trail for this before I invest money into it. I can't even look at the recipes. 🙁,

Love how it supports different diets with guidelines, suggestions, macronutrient targets and good recipes (although some recipes need to be rewritten for clarity and/or missing steps or ingredient amounts). I've tried eating Ketogenic before, but this is the first time I've had success with it, because of Lifesum's encouragement and knowledgeable guidance.",
3416,1,2016-07-06T17:53:43.000Z,BlindPhoenix,Accessibility Lacking for VoiceOver Users,"I love the promise Lifesum for iOS holds out; but since its developers consider requests by users who are blind to make the app accessible as feature requests to be voted upon according to overall popularity and awareness of the issue, I can't actually use the app The developers' attitude toward accessibility, seeing it as an additional feature that might be nice rather than an essential element of good design, means that the company loses customers because of its effectively discriminatory attitude, and that people like me, who rely on VoiceOver and accessibly designed apps, can't benefit from the promise of Lifesum's otherwise enlightened approach to wellness.",

I also liked how it broke out vegetables and fruit instead of just calories like other apps. It made you focus on a balanced diet. Now to the negatives. The ""health algorithm"" for meals is broken. I get a poor rating for a healthy salad with tuna but Hostess cupcakes and combos get the highest rating for a snack? Today the app started crashing after exactly 8.2 seconds from opening. You could use the regularity to set a watch. I chose to delete and return to my normal, less colorful, app.",

I wish there was a test trial to see if we would like to buy the premium version. 25$ is a steep chance to pay for a college student ya feel?",Please contact us directly at contact@lifesum.com and we will see what we can do for you.

However, it is a very good design.  I had the chance to play with it and I like the graphics and it has many exercises available.  I hope in a future update there is a fix for the BMI Calculation.

It does seem to have a little math difficulty (I entered two beverages at 4 calories each, and it is showing the total so far as 7?)  It would be nice if they would add a place to enter cholesterol, if you are watching that in your diet as well.  For under a dollar, it's a good little ap to keep careful track of your calories - something I have never been able to do with any consistency!",

I've lost 5 pounds the first week and a half by keeping careful count. I would like to suggest getting verifications on nutritional information input by users. There are some numbers that are wildly off and I edit them when I can, but it makes a tedious process (counting calories) even more time-consuming.",

Also math is wrong - my breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack can each be 200 calories under individually and my overall calories will only be 200 under. This app is getting worse.

Its hard to eat on the run when ive committed to track my meals and the ease of the program on my phone meant success for me. This app works.,
3451,5,2015-10-08T00:49:21.000Z,Aaaaaalice199222ee,Helping out a lot with meal planning,This app has been awesome so far! I've only had it three days now but it really has helped to keep me more on track with what I consume and when I consume it. I especially love the water feature that tracks how many cups of water you drink. I could definitely see this helping me with fitness goals well into the future! 🙌🏽🍌✨,

3453,2,2016-06-02T16:38:06.000Z,Crd0104,Like the format but terrible ratings,"I tried to contact the app directly but there wasn't an option. The format of this app is great and I like that aspect a lot. However, the rating system is very, very poor. How can coconut oil be rated an ""E"" or an organic fully green juice a ""D""? It seems this app takes data from the early 90's to rate the food rather than current nutritional information. There should be an option to turn off the rating system as it has me questioning my meal choices when, in reality, they're some of the healthiest options.",
3454,5,2016-09-08T18:13:11.000Z,Pink995,"Amazing, Love it","It's wonderful, I think everyone should have this, if nothing else, just to see the impact of the food we eat. I love that it can accommodate my celiac disease/lactose intolerance. (Can't have bread or milk) and how accurate the products are. I like how easily you can add products that aren't there. I kind of wish I had the paid stuff for free, but that's kind of the point. 10/10. 😊",
3455,1,2016-10-18T05:15:48.000Z,KTBell13,Not for broke people,"This app seemed very nice and very simple to use. It looked like a great tool to start helping me try and become healthier all around. I created an account knowing that there were parts that required payment to use, but I assumed that still meant I could use most of the features. I was wrong. With not spending any money, I couldn't do very much or track very much. I didn't even keep the app for very long because almost everything I clicked on was something I had to pay for. I'm a college student that can't afford to spend any extra money. Overall a disappointment.",
3456,5,2016-10-28T15:03:46.000Z,Ahad I.,Great app for counting,"Recently I've been trying to start living a more conscious lifestyle. When I came across this app I was pleased to find it had everything I was looking for when it came to looking at the food I eat. The subscription to me is a little pricey but I find myself satisfied at the moment, will definitely update this in the coming months.",

After using this app for a few months I continue to experience the same issues over and over: my date of birth keeps changing, my weight keeps changing and my goal calorie intake keeps changing to ridiculous values. I also noticed that a lot of the nutritional values for commercial foods are incorrect. I'm also disappointed that it doesn't connect to Strava.","This is very odd!

I downloaded it on my iPad but cannot get the premium version on my iPhone without it needing to upgrade to premium. Anyone else have that problem? I've deleted it on both devices and reinstalled.

I depend on it immensely to count my macros, track my water intake, and (sort of) track calories burned. I do have to say that the calories burned might need some work because I don't think it's super accurate.

They don't always seem quite reliable or correct. I like that you can choose between a couple different diets (for premium users). Nice look and easy to use to stay on track with your diet!",
3461,5,2015-11-21T14:15:23.000Z,Some Irish fella,You need this,"Great app. The upgrade is well worth the extra though. I thought ""no way do I need to spend $8 per month on this""... As I drank a $9 whiskey at a bar. Perspective kicked in. A surprisingly large number of restaurants and food retailers have already inserted their specific data for you so your food diary is extremely specific.",
3462,5,2015-12-18T19:34:07.000Z,Mari.Jo.,Makes me want to get an A,I've tried other apps that just count calories but that doesn't do anything for me. I love that it grades you for each meal/the day. If I get a low grade on my breakfast it motivates me to pull myself together the rest of the day so I can get an A or B!! Preferably an A! I've tried other apps that just track calories but that doesn't do anything for me.,

I liked that you could set the number of pounds you wish to lose/gain, as other apps don't and they pick by their best option. This really made me think about how I eat and how important it is to get an A! ;)",

I'm trying to lose the weight I gained from freshman year and I'm surprised I found an app I like more than Fitnesspal and Lose It! I'm even considering paying to upgrade to Gold/Premium version of this. Looove this app!,

I've tried to track my food before and have always given up but this makes it easy and not feel like a chore. The food library is huge and has everything I eat. It's super comprehensive to know what I'm putting in my body. I only have the free account but am thinking of upgrading.,
3467,4,2017-02-04T18:42:38.000Z,Ckpointe11,Easier to add recipes,"I am really enjoying this app. The way it looks and function are both mostly great, however, it would great to be able to add your own recipes and foods from the home screen. It doesn't make sense to have to go through ""add to my diary"" to get to favorites when I'm actually just adding recipe and not to my diary. And it may not be a favorite either. To simply add a recipe would be more ideal.",
3468,4,2017-03-28T15:35:10.000Z,HoneyB925,Needs to be fine-tuned,"It has made a huge difference in my eating habits, but the calorie tracking is questionable. It doesn't let me add my own nutritional information or at least let me import the info from a recipe I used online (one that wasn't provided by the app). That would make things helpful. All in all, the interface is great and I enjoy tracking the water, veggies, exercises, and meals that I eat daily.",
3469,4,2017-06-01T17:26:41.000Z,visiobsbycara,I love the app....,I love this App! I wanted to give it 5 stars BUT there are a few reasons why I couldn't bring myself to do it. The first is that it's was spendy. $45 A YEAR to get the plan I wanted and one of the main reason I buy the bullet and bought it was for the recipes and there honestly weren't enough to justify the price. 😕,Thank you very much for your feedback! We will continously develop the app and its content so hopefully you will be fully satisfied!

Entering data for food items can be frustrating and confusing. For example, entered data disappears when moving to another field. The diary page is way too busy! It needs to be simplified. The database is quite inadequate and lists many food items I've never heard of.  But, I bought it and hope that improvements are made in the near future.",

Existing recipes use ingredients that are not all readily available at my nearby grocer. Recipes are also limited and food database limited vs other apps. Would be nice to have an option to see what would be a healthier option before we ingest the food. I.e. Scan a cookie and then an alternative pops up or a recipe.

I have it set to the ""maintain weight"" setting, but the best daily ratings I get are on days when I go to bed hungry.

The biggest of which is that you can enter a food and have no idea what date the app will log it in. Could be today, yesterday, or 3 weeks from now. Seriously. They even acknowledge this massive glitch in their FAQ section. The second biggest nuisance is that the website does not interact with the app. Log a food online and expect it to sync with the app?

There is an ability to edit foods, but it's bulky. The portion sizes are very clumsy--in ounces, in many cases, for example, rather than teaspoons. I came from a Treo background, where I had used CalorieKing--which is MUCH better, but sadly not available for iPhone. I've tried a couple of other apps; this seems to be the best of the bunch.",

However, after a few days with it, I’m not convinced that the ratings are worth anything. My fried egg in the morning earned me an A, but the fresh blueberries were rated a D because of added sugar. I’m not sure the developer understands what added sugar means. This app also seems to have some issues with internationalization. My 42 mile bike ride on an American English system was listed with a comma as the decimal separator. I’ll be cancelling my gold membership.",

This app, and service is a deep dive into thinking about food in a healthy way every time.  Yes, I am losing weight, but I also feel great!  I am more active and feel like I am winning.  Lifesum is a tool and if you use it, you can build healthy habits and change yourself.",

They are pushing an update soon but in the mean time follow these steps that worked for me.  1. Turn off automatic tracking 2. Delete the app.  3. Re-install app 4 turn on automatic tracking.

Then I saw the potential it had so I upgraded to the Gold version. So I thought anyway. They charged me for the upgrade but never converted me over to Gold status. Contacted customer support by email and got the run around with computer generated messages. It has been a week now and still no refund or anything. I don't recommend this app to anyone,

3540,3,2009-04-12T01:30:30.000Z,MoonSinger,Not Bad,"This is not a bad app but it does need a bit more functionality. Not everyone wants to lose weight at the rate of 2 pounds per week. That is the MOST the average person should attempt to lose (or you are actually losing muscle as well). There should at least be additional options to lose 1 pound and 1.5 pounds per week. Also you should be able to adjust the percentages of protein, fat and carbs if you are following, say, a lower carb diet.",
3541,3,2014-10-17T15:09:53.000Z,6ryph3n,Has potential to be the best,This could be the best food diary/tracker I’ve found if they didn’t push so hard for Gold upgrade. The interface is much better than MyFitnessPal but basic functionality that MyFitnessPal does for free costs $3/month or more in Lifesum. I understand paying for a subscription if I want an ongoing meal plan but why can’t I just pay a one time price for basic functionality like logging my own food?,

It couldn't be more perfect for my needs.  Thank You Thank You!!",

Also love that it keeps track of calories burned. Just wish that my calories burned with exercise weren't added back into my ""left to eat"" calories since I am working on losing weight, not maintaining it.  Other than that, I love it and all of the features!",

I do not want a free trial of something that will be paid later on, so the app gave me no choice but to go through the trouble of throwing it out and reinstalling the previous version. Now of course all of my data is gone. I paid for the app a long time ago when I bought it, making me pay more in order to continue to use it is just obnoxious. Zero stars would be better.",
3573,5,2011-05-23T13:29:01.000Z,Sharron Mathews,Great App!,Very helpful with weight and calorie management. My whole family uses the app to keep calorie intake and portion size control in the right limits. I've used this app since March 2010 and not experienced many glitches at all. No glitches in the past many months. There have been many updates.,
3574,5,2016-06-09T03:43:05.000Z,HappyDieter,Helpful and user friendly,This app makes it so easy to track calories and input exercise. It has so many food choices and portion sizes.

I like the tracking and accountability but accurate this app is not. I will continue to use the app mainly because I paid for the year after that I am not sure.,

It's based on a balance between carbs, protein, and fat, which seems like a good idea. However, it doesn't work in practice. I put my lunch in today - a salad and some steamed vegetables and it gave me a D because it said both were heavy in carbs. So, I add in the two chocolate cookies I had, and it jumps up to a C! How does that make any sense?",

UI is beautiful & intuitive, but what's keeping me from rating this five stars (and from buying a subscription) is the inability to create a recipe and apply it to your diary like in mfp. Until this happens, I'll just have to use Lifesum and mfp on different days, depending if I'm cooking a dish for multiple people or just myself",

Additional meal planning suggestions are locked unless you pay for it. All you really can do is log your own food and personal recipes - I already know what I eat and that its not working for me.

I loved how the the app was set up, it's all organized and very easy to find everything. The one thing I had a problem with was that I'm allergic to fish and they kept suggesting salmon. I don't know how to do that.  But other than that the app was superb.",

I would like to see more metrics for instance I don't always see when I'm measuring a cup, tablespoon, teaspoon. Also I did pay for this app because I loved the idea of it synching to my Fitbit. It does not do so accurately. For instance I worked out for an hour tonight burned 458 calories according to my Fitbit, I did synch it to Lifesum on Lifesum it says I only burned 229. I am NOT happy I paid for this app. Since the metrics and synching with Fitbit is not accurate.",Please feel free and contact us with more details at contact@lifesum.com so we can start investigating your issue.

I agree with others about the reliability of some of the numbers. I do appreciate the healthy recommendations in the upgrade. The earlier version recommended an unhealthy daily calorie goal.

I would like it if the graph for tracking your weight had all the way down to your goal weight on the y-axis instead of just your current weight. It would be nice to have that visual.

Does anyone know of a good app that tracks points like this one did? I am seriously so disappointed!",

It would be nice if this app would allow bidirectional sharing of nutrition info with other apps. A key advantage of HealthKit, in my opinion, is to allow users to get the best combination of features thorough multiple participating apps. No information silos.

Question for the developers: it seems like the data from the Apple Watch activity and iPhone activity app get added up together in the calculation of calories burnt when they are the same thing.

I had been using another app to keep track of my calories and what I was eating but LifeSum is just so much better and gives me what I really want to see!!,Thanks a lot for your feedback! We are very glad to hear that you like our app!

Since I'm a vegetarian I needed something to track if I was sticking to my diet but this doesn't help in the slightest. But beside those negatives, one positive was the recipes were amazing!",We are very sorry to hear that you are not satisfied! Thank you for your feedback!
3927,3,2017-08-08T21:18:54.000Z,B************+*+,Food Library isn't as good as Lose it,"The food library is okay. It isn't as good as the lose it app. They have so many brands and options compared to Lifesum. It's okay having the protein calculated and I love how bright the app is, but I think Lose it gives me more accuracy although it isn't as pretty",Thank you for your review - we appreciate your feedback! We are constantly working on improving our database! :)

Please update your app and check if you are still experiencing any issues. Thank you very much!

3931,1,2013-11-07T02:06:17.000Z,Kevin Alexeff,Latest update is awful...,"I have been using this app for four years and loved it.  But the latest update is awful.  The graphics are beautiful, but the function is gone.  Lost all my added foods, can't search shared foods on-line, can't copy from a previous day, everything takes more steps.  I'm going to switch to another app even though I lose my historical data.  It's that bad!  Too bad.",

The paid diets aren't extensive, nothing you couldn't find on Pinterest. They also don't account for vegetarianism/pescatarians or the like. Makes no sense paying for three diets and additional stats that would be available for free in other apps. Deleted!",
3935,4,2016-01-05T16:46:27.000Z,Customer1837574,Great but could be better,"I love this app. But it would be great if they allowed one to input more that just sodium, cholesterol...

3938,2,2016-06-27T20:14:01.000Z,AddyZG,Good App but Buggy.,I truly like this app but at the moment it's still quite buggy hence my two stars rate. I've reported to their customer service and they reply me fast and with a good explanation. I hope their software engineer is fixing this issues ASAP and new update will be release soon. Looking forward to use this app more often in near future.,
3939,5,2017-01-10T02:34:18.000Z,Plattyplatter,Great!!!,This app is great. Although sometimes I wish it had a bit more information on some foods or some foods or brands aren't on there. But otherwise it is the best food tracking app there is.,

3949,5,2017-06-26T16:07:44.000Z,H_Smo,Great app,"Not only does it track you, but it sends you motivational messages too. It gives you a detailed health plan to fit your specific needs.",We're very glad to hear you like it ⭐️

The food percentages are wrong, and adding food doesn't seem to work right.   There are numerous spelling mistakes throughout the app. I'm going to put it on the shelf. Hopefully an update will be usable, otherwise I wasted $10.",
3951,3,2012-05-15T20:14:47.000Z,Jmaddox1213,Not so much,"I used this app everyday for almost 6 months and then it stopped letting me ""create food"". So every time I needed to add a food that wasn't in the database, I had to get on the computer and add it. I like Myfitnesspal way better, because you can scan the barcode on whatever you eat and add it that way.",
3952,5,2015-07-09T03:35:57.000Z,Swaggorilla,So fun and useful!,After 90 days on MFP I switched to lifesum and love it so much I wish I had used it in the first place. It's super easy and artsy (especially the little water glasses ;) ) and it is such a fun way to track my health. Keeps me goin man!,
3953,5,2015-10-28T00:14:17.000Z,mcowell526,Update is great!,Simple to use and great features.  Definitely my favorite health app thus far.  HealthKit integration is awesome.,
3954,1,2016-03-12T01:28:28.000Z,lucaskd,No!!,"Let me start by saying this is a beautifully designed and user-friendly app. I used it primarily as a food journal, but I can't get behind the injustice it's doing to people accepting and acknowledging these food ratings as accurate. Frankly, it's unethical to (mis)lead users to believe that a Diet Coke is an 'A' and regular Coke is an 'E'. Tisk, tisk... Hoping for a moral update 'cause the app is otherwise a great tool for tracking intake + outtake!",
3955,4,2016-12-30T19:58:23.000Z,11010 Steve,Great!,"It's a great app, but I have one problem. When you choose the weight loss plan, it asks you for your weight, and what your ""goal weight"" is. So I entered both it said ""try a different number"" for my goal weight. But that is my goal weight.......",
3956,5,2017-01-03T13:29:39.000Z,Zigoat,Easy and simple,I am surprised that the free version offers as much as it does. The food tracker has a wide range of options making it much more accurate.,
3957,3,2017-03-15T21:48:51.000Z,Sammcbettis,Great if you pay for it,I caved and bought the premium account for 3 months to see if it's worth it and u suppose it is. My main gripe is that all the recipes are in metric measurements and I'm a xenophobic American and I need my dumb imperial measurements that I'm used to! Idk what the heck 200g looks like! An option to convert inside the app would be awesome.,
3958,3,2017-07-21T16:40:06.000Z,vpqm2,it keeps shutting down!!,"I have been using the app for 3 days and I was loving it, but now I can't get it to stay open!! it opens for a few seconds, then just shuts down.

3960,4,2009-11-06T14:31:41.000Z,sbharris,What can I say!,I have had this app for about 6 months now and I have lost 25 lbs.! The food database is huge! The only thing that I would like to see different would be it's ability to calculate body fat %. You have to rely on an outside source.,

3966,1,2017-04-30T06:20:26.000Z,JCDearest,Bugs!,New to Lifesum first week went smoothly. Now I'm having issues with the weight tracker. I update my weight every morning but the app has gone nuts and changes what I entered to 30 pounds less!!! I keep switching it back to what's it should be but every time I open the app to log meals and water intake it has dropped it again to 30lbs less that what it should be. This is becoming very unreliable,That is very odd! Please contact us at contact@lifesum.com and we will help you out with this!

4426,1,2017-05-28T23:56:21.000Z,Tulltill,Don't get if your 12 or younger,My friends' cousin couldn't use it because she was 12 years old. I find that at any age you can set goals and you don't have to be limited by your age. It says 4+ on the AppStore but I guess it was a lie. She was so upset and she wanted to try it out because she had an AppleWatch of her own.,We are sorry to hear she was disappointed. We believe that as a teenager this should not be easily accessible due to the susceptibility to body ideals and such. At a young age this can do more damage than good as we can not supervise our users closely as an app.

The ""meal plan"" are just one meal per day with no option to choose something else or plan ahead and see upcoming days. There are no exercises. And worst of all, no way to contact support.

There are so few recipes and additional information that is truly not worth it.  And they make you sign up for at least 3 months and it's not easy to cancel.,

It is SO motivating for me and I'm so thankful I found it, because it has helped completely transform my eating habits. The app itself is designed very well (love the graphics, colors, and animations). I really love the food diary, meal and day ratings, lifescore, the different food/water trackers, as well as the daily and meal-specific calorie tracker. The ratings are what really help me, because they guide me on what foods are best and not-so-good for my health and for my goals. The smileys are awesome. Lifesum even has a weight/body measurement tracker so you can see how many pounds you have lost/gained, as well as an exercise tracker so you can see how many calories you have burned, which is so helpful. I purchased the premium version pretty quickly after downloading, and while it is a little more than I'd like to pay yearly, it's definitely worth it in the long run for me personally.",Thank you very much for your detailed feedback! That is very much appreciated!

5024,1,2017-05-31T21:15:21.000Z,Raquel93dlr,Not actually free,This app's free price tag is inaccurate. You are required to pay to upgrade to premium if you actually want to use it. There isn't even a free trial to see if it's worth the money.,The app as you download it is free of charge but as you mention - it does not offer all functions.

Ridiculous.,"When you purchase a Premium subscription you can either choose to be charged monthly (1-month subscription) or you can pay in advance (all other subscriptions). Choosing a subscription with a runtime longer than 1 month you will get a discount, just as you get one when you are signing up with, for example, a gym membership."

5372,2,2009-06-21T17:16:57.000Z,Goody2211,"User updatable online database a good think, but a fiasco in practice; Cumbersome to add food/recipe","Tracks water. It does not track sodium although screen shots of the upcoming version suggest that sodium will be trackable. While you can enter total fat, you cannot break out the saturated fat or trans-fatty acid numbers. It covers the other major nutritional items and gives you the daily totals of each. Foods are in categories and that works most of the time. However, why are muffins under snacks and not under breads? You can edit just about everything, and there's a trash can where you can go and undelete an item you've deleted. I can add an exercise and edit it. I can ""edit"" a database exercise but the only thing I can change is the name. Can edit everything about custom foods as well as database foods. When I add a new food to the database, I can't enter the nutritional information by serving as it is listed on the food label -- I have to enter it based on 1 of whatever measurement I've chosen. While on the one hand this makes sense, on the other, I now have to have a calculator so I can convert the nutritional information from the food label serving size to 1 of my measurement. That's what computers are for -- I don't want to have to have a calculator on hand when I'm doing my data entry into the app. I could enter a recipe from a cookbook that already has the nutritional values as a custom food. However, if I'm cooking a recipe that does not already have the nutritional values I have to figure it all out manually before I enter it as a custom food in this application. When I add a food to my diary, one of the categories I can select is ""Brand Name"" but it's empty. When I search for a brand food, for example ""General Mills"" nothing is found, so I have to do an online search. I saved a cereal from my online search for ""Genera Mills""; *now* if I go to ""Brand Name"" category I see an entry. If I search for ""Cheerios"" on line, there are tons of entries for ""Cheerios"" -- all different (two different ""1 cup"" servings had totally different nutritional information) -- so I either have to sift through them all to find the accurate entry for my serving type or I have to create my own entry, which would then end up as still another ""Cheerios"" entry in the on line database, adding to the chaos. The on line database needs more brand foods and restaurant foods and once that's done, the on line database needs to be cleaned up. That would solve the problem of everyone making their own entries a la this ""Cheerios"" example. We cannot use this app right now because some of the nutritional items we need to track are not available. When the next version comes out and if tracking the additional nutrition items, cleanup of the online database, food entry with ""per serving"" data entry of nutritional values, and recipe entry with generating of nutritional values are added we'll be happy to use this app and will change the score.",

What an excellent app,"I never write reviews, but this one is so good that I felt compelled to applaud the developers and company in general. Can’t believe how robust this app is and how simple it is to compile “meals” out of individual ingredients just by scanning a bard code, and saving them for use later. Beautiful UI and fluid and intuitive UX. Love the detail of verifying nutritional information with a little check mark next to each product as with most calorie tracking apps you’re given a slew of products and never know which one to choose from the search results.",
5595,1,2021-03-04T19:59:14.000Z,jgfvnhtdx,More genders,....,"Thank you for reaching out. The reason why we currently only have two options available is due to our current calculation of daily energy requirements. We are calculating the daily energy requirement based a validated equation called The Harris–Benedict equations revised by Mifflin and St Jeor, were we calculate the BMR and then multiplying it by the given activity level. This equation take into account variables such as sex, age, height, weight and goal weight. Unfortunately, there are only two sexes available for the equation - male or female. In order for us to proivde the correct nutritional guidance for our users, we currently only have these two available. We are, however, currently working on a better solution for this, as we of course want to be able to include all people - and guide them towards a healthier life though better eating."

5598,4,2021-07-11T15:20:03.000Z,krn20!,Not Bad,"Design of the app is good, but it should be more customizable to input my own measurements. The water log on the watch app is supposed to be easy, but it’s needlessly frustrating, making you choose between a full cup or a full bottle for one-touch input. You have go into the settings to change the amounts each time you want to log a different type. I assume this is because goals are set as cups/bottles per day, but people don’t always drink water out of the same size containers every time every day. I don’t know why I can’t just input by ounces. It’s also not possible to edit your intake via the app, so good luck if you don’t have a watch, and don’t have a 8.45oz cup or 16.91oz bottle. Most of my daily logs are inaccurate so the water feature is pretty irrelevant and needs a major overhaul.","Many thanks for your review!

Everything works great for the most part other than some rare times the app doesn’t boot and my phone requires a restart to get it working. My main problem lies in the lack of sharing towards others who use the same app. For example, my sister made a different more low calorie lasagna but even after making the recipe and putting the steps on Lifesum, she couldn’t send it to me. I know there is a feature coming where you can share recipes with people, but if we could add to that and make a way to also friend other people, it would allow some cool features like looking at more creative recipes other people might’ve made, as well as ingredients people have favorited.","Thank you very much for your feedback, and well done on the streak!

5604,4,2021-03-23T19:14:48.000Z,AngelaElizondo252009,"Good, but needs some work","Great calorie counting app that has a bar code feature to make calorie counting super streamlined. I also like that is breaks down your meal into grams carbs, fat, and protein.  I don’t like how it rates food by smiley faces because it is not very accurate. I am not diabetic and using the classic diet plan, but it rates a medium apple as not a good snack food. I can tell you that an apple is a much better snack than chips, yet they get practically the same rating?? Other things that don’t make sense or could be changed: it adds your calories from exercise to the total number of calories you need to consume. In other words, the app wants you to eat as many calories as you burn???? The whole point of exercise to help you create a calorie deficit to lose weight. If you burn 600 calories working out and then go eat several slices of pizza you just defeated the whole point!!! Because of this the app always shows that I am consuming only 700-800 calories a day, but in reality I am consuming about 1300 a day and also exercising. I also don’t like that you cannot adjust your daily goal calorie intake— I would like to choose 1300, but the app is set at 1500, so I just watch the total number of calories consumed instead of looking at how many calories I have left. If you are total novice at portion control, healthy eating, and exercise this app could make it difficult to actually lose weight. I also don’t like that I have to manage my progress by weight unless I wantto purchase  the deluxe version. I don’t need meal prep plans, meal ideas, or all the other bells and whistles. I would like to track my weight by body measurements, which is a much more accurate approach since a person can gain and lose up to 4 lbs on average during a day in water weight alone. Also measuring by inches instead of lbs is less disheartening for the above mentioned reason. I just track this on a weakly basis on my own, but the stupid app asks me every morning to input my weight. Overall good for calorie tracking if you are mindful of the pitfalls.",

I do OMAD which is one large meal (1200-1400 calories) a day and 22 hours of fasting and weekends I eat like normal. You don’t have this as an option so I’m forced to go over my intake for the day when I’m fasting since it’s a 500 calorie limit. Please update this.,Thank you for your feedback!

The process to add foods that aren’t recognized is pretty simple. Only thing is the app inconsistently syncs with apple health. Sometimes the calories match most times it doesn’t.,"Thank you so much for your feedback, we are glad to hear that you like the app!

5607,3,2021-03-17T23:57:17.000Z,MBPDR82,"Good for casual use, but not best",I tried Lifesum premium a few months ago and it was pretty good. I am not sure it is worth it to pay for the added nutrition facts and nutrition goals. If I’m doing the work to scan an items bar code (that I have in front of me) why wouldn’t the app show all the nutrition facts? MyFitnessPal pal is definitely the better app if you are not looking to pay a premium fee.,Thank you for your feedback!

5608,2,2021-03-10T16:47:40.000Z,LanaIsPretty,Limited control,"When I saw this was voted “best health app” I wanted to give it a try but it turned out to be so much less than I expected. The food tracker is so dumbed-down, it lacks the option to customize your entries in the most basic ways. For example, you tap a water glass icon to enter your water but you can’t adjust glass size- it’s 8oz or nothing. My glasses are 12oz pints. Yes, I can do the math but for a $49.99 app, I shouldn’t have to. It also doesn’t sync accurately with my Fitbit. Only a fraction of my steps show up in Lifesum- it seems to sync once early in the day but doesn’t update. I do like the look of the interface and the way it shows your macros- very easy to read & understand. Just overpriced for what it is- I have found it more frustrating than helpful so far!","Thank you for your feedback, we are sorry to hear that you are not happy with your experience"

When I start planning lunch it tells me my snack was now 21 calories over I know for a fact that it said 525 calories before. Not to mention that you shouldn’t have to PAY to be healthy.

Helps you in every aspect you can account for when you’re trying to plan or follow a diet. But the major drawback is the app is bug-ridden. For instance, when you add food to a meal and leave the app and come back, that good is shown 2 times. Also if you remove one, you come back to see that the item is completely removed. Then the total calories will show 400 or some random number cals left even though you have had 1500/1500 cals.","Thank you so much for your review and feedback, we have sent it through to the team in charge.

Additionally, it has a giant box that says “eat healthy, not hangry” at the top when you don’t meet your calorie goal, and this isn’t something I appreciate given current food shortages in stores from COVID-19.

My only problem is the lack of fine tuning for your personal goals. For example I’m following the 5:2 diet plan and for the 5 days that I’m not fasting during the week I’m expected to eat close to 3500 calories a day? That’s absurd considering I put in the same information (height, weight, etc.) on a separate website and I was told I needed to take in at the most 1700-2300 calories a day depending on how active I am during the day, to lose weight. The math doesn’t add up and it’s kind of frustrating to have the app telling me I’m failing at meeting my daily goals outside of my 2 fasting days. I suggest a future update that allows members to pick their diet plan and then be able to fine tune it to their individual needs. Other than that it’s an outstanding app that’s been really keeping me committed to eating healthier!","We apologize for the issue you are experiencing.

5685,4,2019-05-12T21:53:35.000Z,Veenie81,Calorie counter is TOO HIGH,"This would be a great app, but it allows you to eat too much. I know it’s healthy to do so, but I’d rather it allow me to lose weight faster by limiting my calories a lot more. Other research has shown me that it’s perfectly reasonable to eat less than the 1600 calories LifeSum believes I should eat to “lose” weight as fast as it will let me. I end up gaining weight instead even if it’s perfectly clean eating because that’s A LOT of food. Sometimes I’m sedentary so I logged my lifestyle in to fit a diet for that, but 1600 is impossibly high for my low metabolism to keep up with & I start to feel bigger and bigger & the scale reflects that. I do want to be more active, but that has nothing to do with the app so any progress I make that way is now help from LifeSum. Many other approved sites suggested I subtract 500 calories a day from my regular intake (about 1600 more or less) to lose 1 lb (3500 cal) a week. And then raise my cal intake back up to 1300-1400 to maintain my weight once I reach my goal. So if I don’t BURN 500 extra cal per day while eating 1600 cal, I’ll never see progress, and I may actually see worse. It’s annoying that it will not let me lower the counter one bit. 1600 cal is hardly a weight loss diet for anyone! It’s just about normal for maintaining for most people (especially sedentary) & easily well fit for GAINING for sedentary or less active people in general.","Thanks for you feedback! Our normal plans/diets are calculated on an individual calorie goal, based on the Harrys Benedict formula. This formula gives us the BMR (basic metabolic rate) and then, depending on activity level and goal, we calculate the users TEE (total energy expander). We do not recommend a deficit of more than -500 kcal per day since that has been proven less successful for a long term weight loss. A larger deficit than that also makes it very hard to retain muscle mass."

5705,1,2019-01-15T14:57:05.000Z,a.red8,Unhappy with customer service,This app is advertised as being a certain price per month so I purchased the one advertised as being $3.99 a month for a 12 month subscription which would be $44.99 for the year. I expected that I would be charged monthly as it was advertised but when I received an email with my bill I was charged the full $44.99. I reached out via email to ask about this and get a refund and the company responded that I must get permission from Apple iTunes to get this refund. So now I have to jump through hoops to get my money back and what is their response when I ask why it is advertised that way instead of “I’m sorry” or “how else can we help?”?? That I should have read the purchase before subscribing. Now that is just sneaky. Do NOT advertise your company as being a monthly payment then charge people the full amount. I’m sure it was written somewhere in tiny font that no one can even read. That is just bad customer service too. I am very disappointed with this company and how they handled this.,"We are sorry to hear this! The reason we show the monthly cost, is for our users to see the difference in price from subscribing yearly and monthly. A monthly subscription is also available. We show you the total price before you pay. We are sorry if this wasn't clear enough. If Apple doesn't refund you, please contact us again through email for further assistance."

As in, not telling me I’m 100 calories over for my lunch meal when I had 15 calories for breakfast.

I even got my boyfriend to download it because he was curious about it. After a week of tracking our food, water intake and steps. We realized that it was inaccurate on certain items. For instance large sonic fries said it has 57000 calories but when we looked it up on the app because we thought that seemed high it says only 470 Calories. Also I dislike the fact that I can’t customize the meals I make and it gives me options for meals in restaurants that I’ve never heard of because we don’t have them in the south. As well as the water intake. It only gives you options for 8.45 & 16.91 fl oz. The cup I use is a 32 oz.

I love the setup, the meal ratings, the tips & the ease of use but I’ve found that SO MANY food nutrients are incorrect, even when scanned. For example: International Delight Sugar free Coffee Creamer is labeled on the bottle as <1 carb per tablespoon. When scanned it says 0 everything & even when I go in to manually edit the food for correct information it changes back to the original incorrect information. I was trusting the info in the app when scanned & thought wow I can have more than I thought. Come to find out my few cups of coffee with cream that I thought was no carbs was actually 9g of carbs! That’s half a days worth of carbs in 3 cups of coffee 😳 also Ground Cinnamon says you are -2.5 per teaspoon; also incorrect. I scanned the label & got so excited that I was negative carbs! Wrong again. I had to go out of my way to find the correct nutrients online & come to find out it actually was adding carbs. Too late though, cause I had already ate the food. I feel that paying $49.99 for a yearly subscription is extreme when I have to go out of my way to research anyway to ensure what is in your system is correct. I really loved this app until I found out that information on things I’ve been eating was wrong. Now I’m questioning if I’ve even been in ketosis at all because who knows now what my carb intake, fats, & proteins really were for all the times I just scanned & trusted your system. Also with the exercises, there are so many standard ones that aren’t even listed. I’m just really disappointed.","Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on our app and we are sorry to hear that you have been disappointed.

5714,4,2018-10-02T02:58:19.000Z,SteffNeff,Love this app!,"Found this app randomly. Downloaded it accidentally. It’s been love ever since. Shared it with a table of friends at dinner who couldn’t stop asking me questions about the app and my results. I chose the Keto Strict, and will move to Keto Moderate when I’m ready however there are many great options with inspiring meal plans, Mediterranean, etc.   I never knew how sated I could feel. Ever. The app showed me how much fat, carbs and protein it wanted me to have at any given meal for my “daily diary,” and even made adjustments to allow me more food after exercising. This makes me want to buy myself more calories and fat just by exercising—again and again. The app made me feel good about not following it perfectly. (Since when was guilt never part of dieting?) anyhoo, I love the reminders and alerts. Know that Keto is not the “high protein low carb” and this app has made all the difference in my education on the issue. I have found that Healthy fat is King and is probably the vital nutrient missing in most people’s diets these days. ...Never knew how much fat one could/should have in a day on a Keto strict diet. Freaking amazing! Once I got up to par on my daily intake needs, the rest was a piece of cake, without the temptation!",Thank you very much for your positive feedback!

I like that it tells what is good and bad in food choices, and that it reminds me to eat fruit and fish. I paid for the premium, to get the most out of the app, but these are some things I would like to see: 1) I can edit my macros to my ideal goals. Right now my goal is kinda in the middle of being healthier/cutting fat and gaining muscle. I’m skinny, a tad muscular but have some fat to lose. My macros I like to aim are 30-50/30-40/20. 2) more choices/variety for the “how much”. It’s pretty difficult to exactly see how much I eat or drink but how I would measure it isn’t on the list so it’s difficult to track on the app. 3) recommendations for food products. If it’s saying the slice of bread I’m eating is high in sodium and is processed, show me breads that would be better choices.",Thanks for the feedback!

5818,3,2011-01-04T18:25:12.000Z,Bri_something,Basic but very helpful. (pre-update),"I am happy with this app. Not thrilled but happy. It's helped me lose 5 pounds in 4 days (since beginning my New Year's Resolution) but that is a testament to counting calories in general. I enjoy very low-cal crash diets and this app doesn't hassle you about not eating enough like others do so that's a plus. I often have to enter my ready-meals myself as this app doesn't have as many entries (brands and varieties) in its database as I would like. It doesn't do anything special but definitely serves its purpose and was free when I uploaded it. However, I am reading the newest reviews and see that it is no longer a free service as of the update. Some have mentioned a recurring membership fee?!? I'm sorry you guys were duped but I thank you so much for warning me before I updated this app. I do like this app but it is not worth paying for. Sorry. If you folks are willing to pay, I'd recommend the Calorie Counter Pro by MyNetDiary which is much more comprehensive and user-friendly. No recurring membership fees, just $2.99 up front and worth every penny. I was unable to transfer that app to my new iPhone4 because my MacBook operating system is antiquated so I tried this app instead. I will continue to use this for as long as I can without updating but I would not pay for it. It just isn't worth the money. Especially since I have no interest in joining their club. I just want to log the calories I eat and burn and there are other apps that make doing so simpler and more fun.",

You only need to sign up for the account and get the Gold feature for 3 months such as complete sync etc. After gold expire, you'll status is just back to free account like before, and you still can use this app for its core feature. The free account is only lack feature of complete sync(etc.?), and you can only backup your data for last 1 month(maybe?), the data older than that will be deleted. I still love this app.",

It will allow you custom calories, but why not further that and also allow the fat, protein, and carbs which should then auto calculate the calories. There are times when there are unique foods you cannot search for, and would be easier just to estimate the fat, protein, and carb grams manually. If you could do that, I would give it 5 stars.",

However, it's extremely biased towards on the calories-in-calories-out paradigm. There are very few customization options for paying members. For instance, there is no way to easily view net carbs, and viewing the carb breakdown takes several clicks. The weekly graphs dont display much more than your caloric intake, which is frustrating if you are trying to figure out how you did on your macros. There's some weekly test that a)doesn't work most of the time and then b)grades your responses by some pop culture nutrition nonsense. There is also an annoying emoji that reprimands at ever.single.meal if you for not adhering to the standard American diet. Most of the navigation options are useless. Why are plans so incredibly persistent? I don't need to see that all the time after I've picked a plan. Strangely, low carb and keto plans are listed, but they lack any customization options. You're stuck with whatever white girl nonesense the app has decided is good for you.","Thanks for this great and detailed feedback, we really appreciate it."

I thought ""whatever, I'll buy the premium version"" because like I said, I had heard good things AND because the little upgrade screen says ""$3.75/month"".","Hi, thanks for your feedback! Can you send us a message with your registered email at contact@lifesum.com so we can see what we can do for you? Thanks!"
5844,4,2017-08-22T02:24:55.000Z,Rarararareavdjjdbsgsj,Almost perfect but great!,The app has been crashing recently and the share a meal function isn't working at all. I send it to my boyfriend because we cooked it together and he gets the link it opens his app and then nothing. The meal I shared is no where to be found.,A fix has just been launched to solve the crashes. Please update your app and check if you are still experiencing any issues. Thank you very much!
5845,5,2017-03-15T18:15:54.000Z,Stevemezz,Best app ever used!,I have used my fitness pal for about a year now and I was watching Rachel Austs YouTube the other day when she mentioned this app. I decided to give it a try because honestly MyFitnessPal stresses me out. I ended up falling IN LOVE with this app and the design of it. It's so clean and user friendly. Going to recommend it to EVERYONE! ❤️,
5846,5,2017-03-23T11:18:32.000Z,"Fahrenheit, Celsius, ... you know the rest",LOVE Lifesum,Purchased the yearly pass one month ago and have loved having one location to manage my weight loss. Diary with the bar code scan so easy to use. Haven't spent a great deal of time in the recipes but would love to dive further into those in the near future.,
5847,2,2017-03-25T18:57:46.000Z,Mitchellteam5,Would be awesome if I could use it.,I had this on my android phone and loved it with no issues. Now I've got an iPhone 6 and the app only stays on about 10 seconds at a time and shuts itself down.,
5848,3,2017-03-31T10:20:12.000Z,CreemCheez226,"Awesome, but could be better!",Hey!,"Some of this does sound a little bit odd, so I would encourage you to contact us at contact@lifesum.com. As for the issue with newly added weight showing as ""Start weight"" this might be because you are on the ""Be Healthier"" Goal. If not, please also report this to contact@lifesum.com!"
5849,5,2017-04-03T16:06:45.000Z,03sarah87,"Love it, can only get better","Invested in myself with the premium version and use it on both my android and iPhone. Slightly different interfaces but both good. Some nutrition macros are off, but I don't mind correcting them. I Iike how I can add recipes, and the ketogenic ""fat burner extreme"" meal plan tool offers exactly the kind of tracking I was looking for. After years of different eating plans, this app has been a tool that helps me stay on track, its day 12 and I'm 8 lbs down in ketosis. I like the graphics and feel of this app more than others. A desktop version would be great for rapid entries, but I'll still use this without it.",
5850,5,2017-04-09T18:00:13.000Z,B_LAG_O,I'm here because of Monica Church,I saw it in her YouTube video and was interested in trying it out !,
5851,5,2017-04-26T03:47:22.000Z,Wolfgang Amadeus Beethoven,Amazing,Really good features. I found out about this app threw my favorite YouTube channel. Bramty Juliette. I love this.,
5852,5,2017-05-02T03:44:08.000Z,Ig: @shanell.eshe,I Definitely recommend this app to people tying improve their lives.,This is a great app if you are trying to lose gain weight or maintain a good lifestyle.it helps keep you trying and keeping up on your goals you set .,

5854,2,2017-05-26T03:55:36.000Z,Memeelyn,2 Stars,I used to love this app but now that there constantly asking me to get there premium version I'm starting to not like it before they came out with it you could look at any recipes you wanted but now they made premium you can't it's not that special if you can tell they just want money. I need a diet and they're trying to make me pay for it ugh no. And I barely have any storage and I don't want to get a new app unless it's worth it and doesn't make the people who have premium the only privileged ones so if anyone can recommend/Suggest something for me I'd be so happy and I suggest you not waste storage on this unless your looking forward to paying $5 per month or $29.99 p.s I was gonna rate 3 star but I decided to do 2 cause this made me rethink my options,
5855,5,2017-01-15T18:10:14.000Z,Chris9597,YouTube ?,Whose here from YouTube ??? Whitneyyyyy,
5856,2,2017-02-01T21:37:10.000Z,NinjaYogini,they try too hard to get you to upgrade,"it's really annoying, like i can't even save more than two recipes? and every time i open the app, or try to go somewhere it's an advertisement for upgrades!! $29.99 and so on. very annoying! i'm going back to Lose It.",
5857,5,2017-02-04T10:38:05.000Z,Josequesadajr,Obsessed,Freakin easy to use i love it.help me track my sugar intake. overly obsessed !! 👌✌🏻️🌚,
5858,4,2017-02-06T17:33:14.000Z,ImYourDoom,Great App,Similar to the MyFitness Pal app. Sends notifications if you prefer. Enables you to log your food/water intake. Has the bar code scan feature to make logging simple. It has different meal plans for you to follow.,
5859,5,2017-02-06T17:50:29.000Z,xXxAndyxXx,Great.simple.easy,It is totally easy to use and motivating in itself. Keeps you logged and healthy.,
5860,5,2017-02-21T14:11:10.000Z,mafiamama,Love it!,"I have desisted from trying the premium version due to the recent reviews but I love the basic, especially the bar code option! It is fast to add food to your diary and easy to make improvements to your diet by keeping track. It is missing a few features and could be improved but it serves its purpose.",
5861,2,2017-02-22T16:50:00.000Z,The Magno Collection,"Still searching for a single, smart app","Out of the nutrition apps I've tried this one is the most visually pleasing and easy to use.  However the simplicity overlooks features and makes this app unappealing to me.  I just bought myself and Apple Watch and want a system that is fully integrated without redundancies, but Lifesum comes up short in its integration.",
5862,5,2017-03-03T01:37:19.000Z,ELBolton,Amazing,Amazing,
5863,4,2017-03-04T00:39:10.000Z,Cindy VAC,Pretty good,I used to use MyFitnessPal but I heard about this app on YouTube. The only issue I found is that you can't manually add food or exercise that isn't in the app data base,
5864,5,2017-03-08T20:42:21.000Z,KAYG08,Love this app 🍗🍗🍗,I love this app because i can mark everything I did like exercise and foods,
5865,4,2016-01-26T01:28:04.000Z,Andresitoo90,The Best,Savage App. Very useful.Price should be lower or great updates should be made frequently.,
5866,4,2016-02-15T07:40:17.000Z,Patrick smart,With every new update this app gets less stable,Now i have to close the app in order to see the foods that i've add.Updates are meant to fix bugs not to add more of them.,
5867,1,2016-05-30T17:58:04.000Z,Peabody42,"Well, it's a good try.","They layout and interface are beautiful, gave me hope for over all experience. But even with an upgraded plan I still wasn't able to adjust my macros, I was just given three choices. I like being able to set my own protein/fat/carb instead of having to choose what they give me and then having to figure it out on my own. The app also has a very limited database of food with the bar code scanner. It also does not sink with Fitbit/garmin. Also, some food is WAY off. For instance it told me that 4 large eggs had 135 carbs. Ummmm...escuse me? I didn't eat Cadbury eggs, just regular 'ol chicken eggs. That was more carbs than I was supposed to eat for the day. Since I KNEW that was WAY off it made me wonder about the rest of the food.",
5868,1,2016-06-08T12:47:32.000Z,shagunster,Don't pay to upgrade!!!,It's not worth the money to upgrade. I also misunderstood the subscription terms and paid for 3 months and thought it would be paid per month and not all at once for $21.99. Big mistake. The recipes are very limited and that's pretty much all your paying for. Definite waste.,
