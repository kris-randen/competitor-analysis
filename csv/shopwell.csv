It was so frustrating shopping for food and reading labels. I can‚Äôt have gluten, dairy, and sugar. It was a nightmare to ready labels and figure out what is what. I literally had a melt down in the store and started crying when I had spent two hours reading labels and had nothing in the cart to eat.",
1,1,2020-09-15T00:34:49.000Z,jasmineMicjel,DOWNLOADERS BEWARE! Sounds like a good idea except the app doesn‚Äôt work,"I am gluten sensitive and have to avoid foods that contain gluten. I have been in desperate search for food scanner apps that help weed out diet restrictions and this app came up. I love the idea that this app will help because gluten takes forms in many ingredients and it‚Äôs hard to remember each ingredient or have to search it up while food shopping. However, upon installing the app it‚Äôs been giving me a hard time setting up an account and loading each screen on the app! Navigating through each screen and on each page the app is malfunctioning and there‚Äôs a pop up saying ‚ÄúError! Something went wrong‚Äù ... what is this madness?! I have deleted the app, restarted my phone and reinstalled, still nothing. It‚Äôs being downloaded over strong WiFi, so I know connection isn‚Äôt the issue. However this is very disappointing to the point that I had to write a review and let the developers know there is a serious bug and it needs to be fixed, my review won‚Äôt be changed until then, when I can get the full experience of the app.","Hi Jasmine, we would love to help you on your gluten free journey. We found and fixed the issue you are referring to. Please try once more. If you need additional support, we can help at support@innit.com"

It is so easy (and fun) to adjust your personal/family diet settings, and then search for products that match what you are looking for. When you open the app, it automatically shows several products that are good matches for you.",

However, it has some issues that make it less usable than I want it to be. It seems like any attempt at editing profiles or lists ends in an error message. The search function could also be improved, as you don‚Äôt really get to see all the results when you search something. For example, I searched ‚Äúcondensed soup‚Äù and only got a handful of results when I know there are many, many soups logged on the app. It would be nice to have more results and maybe even a way to filter them in the future.",
5,4,2021-06-28T19:23:15.000Z,pleae reAd developers üòá,I have a recommendation,I love the app and have been using it for a week. I really feel like this would really improve the app so I wanted to inform the developer about it. While doing the sign up process there are certain things which are asked of people; their wants and avoidances of certain food categories. As an example I‚Äôll use the terms disaccharides and sulfites from the app. Let‚Äôs say a new user sees these terms and doesn't know what they are. It would be really cool if there was a way for its information to be displayed through a double click or if it was just there. I hope I came up with something useful.,

I have developed allergies later in life and having successfully raised a child with food allergies I thought I knew what I was in for but my allergies are so different and so much more complex that I knew I needed help. This is the best app I have found for people suffering from food allergies. It is capable of alerting you to allergens not listed on the label which is where I was finding myself in trouble. Thank you so much for this life saving app!!!!,

My schedule doesn‚Äôt really allow me to cook, so my focus moved onto what kind of food/product I consume. I was struggling with my new goal, but discovering Shopwell changed my game. Shopwell makes it super easy for me to know which product I can trust and consume, knowing that it is good for me.

When searching an item I wish it would sort them into best choices 1st. It‚Äôs annoying to look through several lists of avoids before finding something. Also, there are a lot of foods, especially store brands, that are not in the database. I‚Äôve tried to add them but get the error that the barcode wasn‚Äôt included, but there is no way to add it.

They understand that junk food is a special treat, but they can grab from the fruit bowl without asking.  This is great, but can be overwhelming at the grocery store when I'm bombarded with ""Dad, is this junk food?"" over and over.",
71,5,2013-10-22T20:10:25.000Z,Chellelove808!,Extremely useful,"I disagree with what some reviewers are saying about this app being misleading.  It is accurate in telling you what you should avoid according to YOUR preferences you input. While there may be some things on here that will score ok that you wouldn't eat because of GMO's or additives and things like that. But if you are a super naturalist you don't need an app to know that the most ""clean"" foods are organically grown produce from local farms and non caged and well fed animals for meats. HOWEVER this app is used for scanning PACKAGED foods!! And the reality is, although we are more health conscious than ever, most companies can't keep up with demand w/o some unfavorable preservative ect. So that being said, I've found this app extremely useful!! The scanning feature easy and fun. It's helped me stay away from gluten and from there you can determine if something they suggest is ok for you particularly. Totally worth it app. I've never used a nutrition/food shopping app more. :)",
72,5,2014-06-14T20:56:16.000Z,Matt De G,Perfect!,"This app is perfect. Not only is it specifically designed for those with food allergies (nuts, dairy, wheat, gluten, etc.) you can customize it to let it tell you what to avoid based on your specific diet needs. So, if you want to avoid foods with high fructose corn syrup, or eat foods high in protein, or avoid foods low in saturated fat, anything specific, then this app does that too! The scanner is fast and accurate, letting you know to ""avoid"" it and why or letting you know if the food is good for you based on your diet/allergies. It will even rate the food for you on a percentage scale and gives you better suggestions to increase what it is you want to intake more of!",

80,4,2012-07-06T19:40:21.000Z,Ven0m Vixen,Great app- could use added features,"I just started using this app and quite like it so far. The break down of what is good vs bad in the nutrition and ingredient lists is fantastic and I enjoy knowing why a food is rated with it's particular score. I think the app could use a little more personalization in the profile set-up. When determining what's right for you it should take into account your true age (not a 31 year gap- since being a 22 year old is certainly different than 44). It would also be useful if it took in a persons weight, height and body type; all these things can influence what is better or worse for your diet. A food diary that notes needed calories and nurtritional needs with daily intake would be nice too. It would be great to see this app take things just one step further- then it would be worth 5 stars.",
81,4,2012-08-17T21:01:33.000Z,Mamagoose79,Has really opened my kids eyes,"I really like this and it has been helpful with my kids making better choices.  We probably scan everything to see what score comes up or to see how much healthier it is. My kids don't want to touch anything with a scale lower than 60 (not sure why, probably because of the grading scale).  However, I have been surprised how much healthier some kids cereals were over ""healthy"" brands and I have rethought some of my own choices.  I would give it 5 Stars, but I am not sure how to add a product and suggested alternates were little off (scanned diced tomatoes and alternatives were tomato paste).  There were options for things to like and don't like, but I really don't know what they were there for.  Also I wish I could my own products on the shopping list.",
82,5,2013-01-03T14:12:00.000Z,Nikki McKeever,Awesome decoding food app!!,"Love that this app is able to let you know if a product has harmful preservatives without you needing a degree in nutritional science to figure it out.   Also, it gives you examples of every type of food that you could think of that would best match your health requirements or simply scan an item's barcode to find out, so convenient.  Another great idea was the coloring/numbering system that tells you where a particular food weighs in, in terms of whether or not it is the right food choice for you.  So whatever your diet situation needs are like avoiding foods with certain allergens, avoiding foods because of high blood pressure or certain diseases, or just to be health conscious and savvy to maintain general health this is a really great tool for all these.",
83,5,2013-01-15T18:05:28.000Z,BCE75,Love this app,"I have been looking for something like this for a while now! It makes it easy to figure out what to buy at the store, and I found that some of the stuff I was buying wasn't as healthy as I thought. I also discovered some stuff was actually better than I thought! It's great when confronted by so many different brands of the same item, and now I can choose the healthiest choice. I wish it had more store brand items available such as Kroger and Hy-Vee store brands, but I can compare their nutrition info to the name brands. I can vouch that it DOES NOT promote the major brands like the first review states. If your ""health"" food doesn't rate very high, it's probably because it isn't actually that healthy.",
84,3,2013-10-11T15:01:17.000Z,Ydnammandy,Could stand a few changes,"It's a useful app for the most part. It's easier to read the ingredient list on it than on some packaging - provided the product is in the database. The first improvement needed is the ability to add your personal food allergies. In my case it would be grapes, cilantro, bell peppers, and broccoli. I became extremely sick a few weeks back because I didn't realize I had accidentally grabbed something with grape juice in it. The other thing that needs to be tweaked is the fact that the app will flagged added sugar products, even if you don't select that as something you want to avoid. If it's going to flag the substance anyway, there's no point of pretending we have a choice in the matter. I know that processed sugar is not the best of substances, but it's better than digestive problems I get from grapes and artificial sweeteners. Frankly, it would help me more if the app differentiated between raw sugar, brown sugar, and white sugar.",
85,5,2014-01-18T17:33:26.000Z,ColombianCuti3,Great App for food searching!,"This app lets you search for food and look at the nutrition, ingredients, and benefits it will have or not have for you, based on a personal profile that you create about yourself. You pick what you want in food (protein, calcium, low fat, etc.) and what you don't want (sugar, sat. fat, sodium, etc), so can find out if that food you're looking for is healthy or not, and if it isn't then there are healthier alternatives available for you to look at and learn about. This is a great app for shopping, learning. It helps teach you more about what's in the food you eat. I recommend this app, I use it when I'm curious about buying food, whether it's candy or a type of yogurt.",

Plus it provides badges for accomplishments who doesn't love rewards. Speaking of rewards, this app offers missions which will potentially offer such items as gift cards.

It's helped me to choose better quality items and avoid items I didn't realize had ingredients that were undermining my goals; and I've been reading the nutritional labels closely. There are a couple things I'd like to see improved. One, a larger database but this app is still pretty new and I know the nutritionists making sure the data that is in the database is correct. Two, and I know this is asking a lot, but if this some how could sync with some of the fitness and health monitoring apps that would be great.

Still waiting to hear from the company about the source of their dextrin. Otherwise, ShopWell has been immensely helpful and makes shopping fun!

You can browse categories, search, or scan your foods (and see what higher scoring options there are).  You can create shopping lists off of it as well... But this isn't really an all-in-one grocery shopping app, in that it doesn't have prices, stores, etc like you can get in an app like Grocery IQ.  I'll use this app to determine which products I should buy, and use a dif app to create my shopping list of those products.  Very cool and well executed idea.",

It won‚Äôt load, I can‚Äôt log in, I‚Äôm at the grocery store and it won‚Äôt scan properly...so it kind of defeats the entire purpose of having it. I messaged the app via Facebook today after it once again wouldn‚Äôt allow me to log in, and they said they were having an issue they expected to resolve shortly. That was at 5pm and it‚Äôs  now almost 11pm. I even deleted and reloaded it. It‚Äôs clearly an issue with the app. Kind of disappointing, especially after it was recommended to me by a GI doctor and dietician.",
120,5,2012-05-10T13:47:21.000Z,Drastik07,Amazing,Love this app works wonders on my iPhone 4s I don't usually rate but being able to scan and look up items in my fridge and pantry and being told its good or bad is amazing also the customizable lists that tell you what to get or what to avoid is awesome I find myself scanning most things just wish it had more of a database there are smaller stores that don't sell the brands or the brands they do sell aren't listed I don't normally review apps but this one is amazing the built in shopping list deserves 3 stars by itself,
121,5,2012-06-29T14:02:08.000Z,Nvbduey,Addictive...,"Very helpful App. Love all the ways you can find ANY item out there. Also like that you can see the nutrition facts and ingredients. This is a good App even just to compare foods when you need to with the healthier option and yet have little time (or patience) in supermarket to stand there and try to read labels, this does it for you in advance, and then you can add the items to a list to know exactly which one you need to just grab off te shelf (with the exception of price comparisons...) I recommens this App.",

In practice it's turning out to be very useful and helps me plan my weekly meals according to my weight loss plans and exercise/health goals. My only complaint is that it doesn't recognise the two closest grocery stores - which are chains and not local. This makes for some uncertainty on whether or not the store will have exactly what I've added to my list. Other than that, wonderful.",

Shop well has made it so that if there is a product which I am not sure is gluten free, I can scan it and it will tell me. Also, for awhile I was on a low FODMAP diet and Shopwell gives you the option to select that so it will avoid certain foods. If you have any allergy, are on any type of diet, or want to manage special types of vitamins that you are in taking, I definitely recommend this app!",

So, for example, if I can't hv grains, don't show me the big AVOID sign, show me my options & if I hv none, show the AVOID sign when I go to that category (& since programmers can do just about anything, hv the category go away if there are no options & possibly encourage users to offer alternatives if the app doesn't hv any.)

All you need  to do is scan the barcode on a food and it tells you how well it scores for you.  Thumbs up and amazing!  It is üëçüòÑ for allergies or just eating healthy.

In keeping with my personal goals I found the shopping list and where I can find items that are truly better for me super handy.

What does it all mean, and what does it mean to me?  This app does a good job helping me sort through the clutter and find more foods that are a good fit for my needs.  I've used it before, and now i'll use it more often since they started offering rewards that show up every so often when I use it to find out about the food I'm thinking of buying.",

If I scan a cereal that isn't good for my diet, why would it suggest a whole grain pizza and not another cereal that would be good? Would make sense to suggest something in the same category that you are scanning. I like it otherwise and believe that it will be helpful in losing weight and staying away from lactose.",
136,3,2013-04-01T03:49:15.000Z,Mlshaughnessy,Almost awesome,"I love this app. It is highly helpful and provides immediate feedback that is much faster than googling individual products. This app would get 5 stars except for a few things. Although dietary preferences can be selected the feedback is still bias towards traditional diets that I do not follow. For example, on my list of red ""avoids"" saturated fat is not checked. However it still appears in the feedback as a red frown face and is factored into the match. Also I would like there to be a ""carbohydrate"" or ""high sugar"" Avoid option, or a ""low carb"" option under the Wants tab.",

But it is a great tool for checking what ingredients are in line with your health needs, as you dictate in setting your profile. The categories of menu items to avoid or items you want to include in your diet are a bit too broad for me. With some tweaking, this app will help to eliminate  anymore wasted time on fact-searching for products at grocery stores!!!!",

If you need information on what to shop for as you're shopping, this app is definitely helpful.",

I recommend taking the time to make your food list by category (dairy, breads, etc), which makes shopping easier.  There are name brands I am not familiar with, but I add them to the list because they are 100% in meeting my goals, then I add ones I am familiar with that my store carries that may be at 86%, just in case I can't find the 100% name brands.

I love that there is a score on how healthy the food is. I love that the app highlights the preservatives and other ingredients that are not so good. However, there are redundant food items, which often times has different scores even though its the same item. Cheerios is an example.

For example, if an item has added sugar it is docked points. This is good but they dock it the same amount if it has 20 g added sugar or if it has 1 g added sugar. There are cereals with 15 g sugar that are rated better than similar cereals with 5 g sugar because they have a little more iron. This app also does not take into account calories or portion size. There are veggie burgers with 300 calories and 15 g protein rated higher than veggie burgers with 100 calories and 10 g protein. This doesn't make sense. I have found numerous examples like this. I hope no one is basing what they eat on this app!",

Put in your own personal goals to customize and I have been constantly surprised by the results of things I've been buying - sometimes items are better than I thought. The scan piece is wicked fast too so you can balance item and scan in a millisecond instead of laying it perfectly flat and looking like a tool at the grocery store,

The scanner has trouble recognizing some barcodes (but searching for the product turns up the desired result usually) and, sadly, I sometimes cannot find the suggested alternatives in my area. Overall, it's another great tool that helps rank foods based on personalized preferences. An app will never replace common sense and general nutrition knowledge.",

Don't assume everyone has the same goals. If I want to personalize it to my high fat diet, let me do so, or don't tell me it's customizable. It also needs a bigger data base. Or let people enter their own foods and add to the database. I scanned two snack bars, one by larabar and one by Rise and it didn't recognize either. Great idea. Poor implementation. Hopefully it'll improve and I can use this in the future. For now it won't waste space on my device.",

There are several products in the system, I'd say for every ten items I scan two to three do not go through. 4/5",

I'm a vegetarian and a lot of products sneak meat in them and it would be nice to be able to not have to worry about reading all labels!

So I hit the ingredients button and it's reading ""sunflower butter"" and classifying it as dairy because it says ""butter"". To me, they're tried to make a shortcut, thus, providing inaccurate information and ultimately very poor customer service. The missions are gone, as well. I enjoyed doing them. Please correct the ingredient ""sensitivity"" and bring back the more accurate scanning process. Thank you.",

Let's you select your food allergies, intolerance or goals and then gives you detailed information about specific products you scan or browse based on your settings. The best part is, it highlights all the ""bad stuff"" out of the ingredient's list, contains full nutritional information and gives you healthier alternatives!",

I now use it for myself as well and it saves me from a lot of researching and planning before and while shopping. My only Suggestion would be to be able to save multiple profiles on the same acct.,

It's very helpful and I appreciate it very much.  To the creators of this app hats off!!!,

Due to my inability eat or drink anything containing lactose and a new found inability to ingest gluten I've struggled figuring out what I can and cannot have anymore.  Now I'm not worried if I can have this or have that!  It has an abundance of items and suggestions on foods I can eat!  Made my life just a tad easier :),
191,1,2012-07-27T15:31:41.000Z,jmayo32158,Can I trust it?,"It is a stellar concept but less than satisfactory execution. It seems that if it is not a major brand it‚Äôs not listed and if it is listed the major brand gets a better rating. I scanned some juice that had no additives it was rated very much lower than a major brand with more additives than you can shack a stick at. Than sativa is an artificial sweetener. Really! That brings the whole app into question. What else do they have wrong. In my opinion I can‚Äôt trust the app to give me good information, therefor it is of limited use. Hopefully I will be able to trust it sometime in the future.",
192,4,2012-12-19T02:30:52.000Z,Shadow&Zowie,One improvement,I was just diagnosed with high blood pressure and cholesterol.  This app is really helpful to make better choices. I would suggest an area where you can search for a specific item rather than having to sort by product name. It takes way too long to scroll through all that is listed. Otherwise seems to be very helpful,

Like a kid with a new toy, I started scanning everything in my pantry. Items were coming up as ""containing gluten"" when the item package was CLEARLY labeled ""gluten free"". Last night I scanned some ice cream (just for fun), your app said it contained wheat & gluten.. NOT ONE ingredient listed would've contained wheat or gluten. PLEASE fix this! Or at least have a way for users to leave a comment on specific items. I will be deleting the app til bugs are fixed. Such a shame.",

I realize the app isn't meant for baby type food but would be nice of there was some option for those. We homemake mostly everything so the snack type stuff we could use a little guidance on.

Also when I do a search I want more comprehensive info to compare things with for instance I searched Halls Drops but it only came up sugar free. I didn't want sugar free and Shopwell didn't recognize my 2 brands. I need to check my current house items for gluten to know to stay away from it later. Thx!,

For instance, a product containing a lot of protein but also a ton of preservatives and GMO additives is not an ""excellent source of protein"", it's a product with a very high amount of protein; there are certainly other healthy products that are truly 'excellent sources' of protein and are overall more nutritious. Please consider this change; the philosophy behind this app is otherwise great.",

However, I'd really really love it if the app designers would make it where I could add other members of my family onto my profile to make sure I'm shopping for them as well!

244,3,2012-12-04T17:20:23.000Z,Dlr1979,Ok,"The only thing that would make this app better would be the ability to add your own list of allergic foods. I recently found out I'm allergic to 24 different foods, including pork, beef, yeast, sugar cane and iceberg lettuce, to name a few.  I'm allergic to so much I have to carry an epipen. Sometimes I can't remember all of the things I'm allergic to, and certainly not when I'm shopping.  I'll try this out for a while to see how it works.",
245,4,2013-03-28T20:08:46.000Z,Jilshiva,Reason for a 4 star and not 5,I would have given this app a five star since I have used it before on my husbands iPod and i loved it but when I got an iPad it was difficult to use because the screen is small and when you enlarge it everything is pixelated. If this app was for the iPad as well i would have given it a five star.,

It constantly freezes up when I scan an item, and half the things I scan have no rating. It worked better before all the updates, now it's a huge waste of time and the constant pop up rewards are annoying! I think it's time to look for something that actually saves shopping time.",

253,4,2014-03-21T05:49:52.000Z,Khaleesi110,Great app but with some limits,I love this app to help track down celiac friendly foods! However I also have several other food allergies that aren't an option for avoidance. My biggest complaint (and the reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5) is the lack of option to avoid meat and animal products for vegetarian/vegan diets.,

I am putting my autistic son on a GF/CF diet and am a little intimidated. Lots of options on this app from typing in the product name you want info on to scanning barcodes for nutrition info. And it takes into consideration the parameters you set for allergies.,

Very impressed with the quantity of products in the database.",

I've tried to set up a login account an it won't go beyond the screen that ask if I'm male or female the number of people I shop for and my age.   Not sure why that I for is important.

270,1,2012-03-11T23:14:22.000Z,Bubahloo,To be seen,I absolutely love this app I use it every time I go shopping. However I gave this app 1 star so hopefully this comment will be seen. Most of the time while shopping I try to be reasonable and look at both store brand and non-name brand items. I was a little disappointed to see that the brand Kroger was nowhere to be found on this app along with grocery stores just as King Soopers brand. I hope to see these brands and many more soon. And when it happens I will definitely give the app five stars.,

320,1,2011-11-25T21:09:10.000Z,Mags Magee,Unreliable for gluten free foods,"If you must avoid wheat gluten, it's all or nothing. So what am I supposed to think of a product rating that is less than a 100 percent match for the search term ""gluten"" and a sole profile of ""gluten-free""? A product either has gluten (NOT acceptable in ANY quantity for those with celiac disease) or it does not. Expensive processed packaged ""health"" foods dominate the lists. We don't all live in sophisticated cities where grocery stores have aisles and aisles of this stuff. In summary, app is useless if you need to avoid wheat gluten.",
321,5,2012-03-28T01:12:57.000Z,Eats Healthy on Weekdays,Spot hidden transfats with Shopwell and awesome shopping list!,Love to use this app to learn about foods and nutrition and to make my list.  What's really cool is the app actually spotted trams fats in a food I was considering.  I didn't realize that even if the label says 0% trams fats it is not always true.  Great app for grocery shopping.,
322,3,2012-06-28T11:33:23.000Z,GlobalWarmer,What about Carbohydrates?,"One of my biggest focuses as an athlete is juggling my macronutrient I take through the seasons. Right now, my main focus is cutting carbs and upping my protein and healthy fats... With that said, why doesn't this app allow the user to select ""High Carbohydrates"" as a flag to set for foods? It seems like everything else is perfectly fine but I find this missing feature bothersome.",

Also, another great feature would be to add KOSHER/HALAL seal of approval.  That'll really cut my search.  On top of that, is to add alcohol listing thread in the search factor.",

This app is great for that and I love the missions. I only have this 4 stars because every time I go out of this app it logs me out. If the was not a problem it would be 5 stars.,

I guess there is no point in using this app if it is going to give me the wrong. Information on such an important allergy, who knows what other foods it will get wrong?",

339,4,2017-04-14T01:21:08.000Z,VeroCon,Great app but freezes,This is the best when it comes to finding what's not good for you based on your specifications. It even tells you what other options are better for you based on your specifications. It freezes up shop that's the only downfall.,

349,1,2016-04-15T00:03:44.000Z,Wggshdifjheheuafsyufofu,Get it if you want to turn your phone into a snob that judges you,It automatically assumes I care about a tiny amount of added sugar and that I'd literally rather have everything be organic.  I set it to only check for gluten and it is telling me that spaghetti sauce is a medium match for me only based on sodium and it doesn't say anything about gluten and then suggests other stuff that is way worse in other aspects like fat and saturated fat.  Go for it if you're a cuckolded hipster.,

If you simply buy really mass-produced goods, basic brands that you find at you're mainstream grocery stores this is a good application, but if you shop at Whole Foods, healthier places, use healthier brands, or organic this would not work for you.

1728,5,2016-10-21T19:11:31.000Z,Linestein,I couldn't live without this app,"I truly LOVE this app and couldn't live without it. I have celiac disease and can not eat gluten. If I want to eat it and it does not say gluten free I scan the items bar code and it instantly tells me if it's safe for me to eat. Omg I can't say enough about this app, I could go and on. It's easy to set up to your health needs and if they don't have a particular product you take a picture and they will work on adding it. AMAZING app that I'm using as we speak to check on a candy bar. ‚ù§Ô∏è this app. Thank you.",
1729,5,2016-12-07T21:09:49.000Z,Bhupinder Bali,Fabulous and Wonderful,I follow vegan diet. It had always been pain reading ingredients of products. This app has simplified my purchases and I love this app now while shopping. Just configure diet once and scan the bar code whenever you buy any products.,
1730,5,2014-04-20T07:04:42.000Z,Muffin25674,I'm amazed,Ok so first I love this app!!!! It makes it much easier with it! It tells u what's good and bad!!but a lot of foods and drinks it will say item not found.so a little improvement but its A OK,
1731,1,2014-04-21T17:26:40.000Z,Vagieray,Decent but frequent logoffs make it a pain,Decent app but frequently doesn't have the data you need and the frequent log offs and password re entry make it a pain in the butt to use.,
1732,5,2014-04-30T23:30:10.000Z,BBDeux,Easy does it,"This app makes going to the grocery store soooo much simpler! Having dietary restrictions is a pain in the butt and this app is the light at the end of the tunnel, no more label reading for me!",
1733,5,2014-05-17T06:31:47.000Z,ZenZombieJen,Amazing!,I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and this app has been a huge time saver for me at the grocery store. So much easier to scan the bar code then read tiny print to look for hidden glutens. I showed the app to my doctor and he is recommending it to his other patients!  Thank you!,
1734,5,2014-06-24T23:18:48.000Z,Dee Dee 2012,I never review or rate apps,"Love, love, love this app. It takes all the guess work out of finding foods that are in your personal guide lines. So far hasn't crashed or crapped out. I have been going through my pantry & checking my foods, lol.",
1735,1,2014-06-27T05:17:00.000Z,takswagger,Meh,The amazon gift card thing doesn't work useless app !!,
1736,2,2014-08-16T10:56:25.000Z,Lim700,Can be better,This App is pretty good.This app takes away the time you spend in the supermarket holding produces comparing and reading all the nutritional value in each and ever thing . You just scan and go . The only reason I didn't give it a higher rating Is because I would like them to add more supermarkets / stores to its list . For example I can't get to Walmart all the time  ( which seem to be the main supermarket/store) . So I go to my local supermarket which is Keyfood . When I scan the Keyfood brand foods (which is the the equivalent to  great value- Walmart ) it shows no info. This can be a number 1 app if only it can add more .,
1737,4,2014-08-17T19:05:26.000Z,VetTechTNStair,Fun App to Use,"Aside from the obvious use of it for healthier shopping options, I love the missions it gives you to complete for Amazon gift cards. I just wish it would actually redeem my gift card points when I complete my missions!",
1738,3,2014-10-08T13:17:35.000Z,kalthoffdesign,Ok but missions need work,"I like the new missions feature and the opportunity to get an Amazon gift card. However, within the mission when I need to type something out there is no way to hide the keyboard again and I can't get to the bottom of the questions to finish. Very frustrating when I'm standing in the middle of the grocery store trying to complete as quickly as possible. It would also be nice if there were a way to save your scan and picture of the display so you can complete the questions later.",
1739,5,2015-01-23T03:12:40.000Z,Hennessy 123,The best ever!!!!!!,This app is really great it has helped me tremendously.it helps you to watch on what you eat for example I love chips and it told me some other chips that were better for me than hot Cheetos. It finds foods for you that are not only healthier for you but taste very similar. Hopefully it helps you the way it helped me.üëçüëç,
1740,5,2013-01-16T20:16:21.000Z,Elizabeth (Beth ),Bar code scan,This app. is great! It will help you to monitor and make better choices at the grocery store. Anything to live a healthy life! üòÉ,
1741,5,2013-01-29T03:29:16.000Z,Redhead66,I'm learning...,"I just downloaded this app yesterday and already I've learned that some foods I thought were good for healthy eating aren't necessarily good.  I like that I could determine which things I want to avoid (added sugar, refined grains, etc.) and that the app gives explanations for the score each food receives.",
1742,5,2013-02-01T03:50:21.000Z,DennardSr,Truck Driver/Ex-Athlete,Love this app!Really helps me with my NY's resolution to eat healthier especially due to my being on the road as much as I am.Big up's ShopWell!!!,

1744,2,2013-02-06T22:38:26.000Z,Uncle.Lou,Does not deliver,I was careful to select my nutritional parameters and it completely ignored my preferences and recommended foods that did not fall within my guidelines. Disappointing. I really wanted to like this app.-----deleted,
1745,5,2013-07-01T21:51:23.000Z,2014ever,Great App,Shop well is an excellent aid for determining what products to buy relative to one's dietary needs & what products to stay away from. The bar code scan feature is highly valuable for decision making.,
1746,5,2013-12-14T04:19:51.000Z,Britt9111,Fast and easy,I have Celiac disease and I'm lactose intolerant so this app is very helpful when reading labels. All I have to do is scan the bar code and it will tell me if it's a safe food or not.,
1747,5,2014-02-15T10:17:20.000Z,Yola3366,Love it,Best app on here.finally a app that helps me to pick the right food.thank you,
1748,5,2014-03-16T17:33:21.000Z,Rosie posie08,Bomb.diggitycom!!!,Just started using this bad boy today!!! And I love love love it!!! Amazing at detecting anything and EVERYTHING you don't want in your food.,
1749,4,2014-03-26T01:55:55.000Z,Jdavis410,Newbie,I'm fairly new to closely watching what I eat and this app has been so helpful! A few tweaks to better color code the ingredients and added allergens would make this a 5 star app!!,
1750,5,2012-01-16T01:38:13.000Z,Vintnerd,What a great app!,"It sure makes it a lot easier to identify foods that contain gluten.  I love the bar code scanner feature, it takes all of the guesswork out of shopping for healthy foods.",

1753,4,2012-07-11T11:36:45.000Z,Tutu6x ªs,More options in profile,Iam new to this app but anxious to use it. I am battling a tough cancer and i would like to see more options in the avoid category and maybe soon there will be skin care products etc. because theres so much hidden bad ingredients that feeds cancer. Just an idea that many ppl will surely use.thanks,
1754,4,2012-07-14T15:29:45.000Z,WaitingGame,Good APP,Will give 5 stars when I can delete scanned items without having to put them in my list first and then deleting them.Takes to much time to delete if you add to list and then have to delete.,
1755,4,2012-07-24T15:58:27.000Z,El Waylondo,Interesting,"So, it makes grocery shopping take a little longer.  So, it seems a little inconsistent in the ratings it gives to some foods, and some of the alternate choices are completely alien to me.  Still, this app gives me the ability to scan nearly any item in the grocery store and quickly confirm or debunk the claims of the manufacturer.",
1756,5,2012-09-09T16:43:23.000Z,Lingtone,Cool,Cool app tells u the details of food u can also get a iTunes card for downloading app redeem and use my bonus code lingtong,
1757,5,2012-10-02T07:51:35.000Z,Chi-Chee,Amazed,"Once I learned how to use this app and created my own personal choice list as in what I really wanted in the foods I ate, it became really easy to distinguish what was good and bad. I love how you can scan the bar code any where and receive all the info needed.",
1758,4,2013-01-06T13:51:43.000Z,Thamagickman,Great app,My only complaint is that the bar code scanner makes this loud piercing sound. Is there a way to turn it off?,
1759,5,2014-03-22T18:33:18.000Z,Jeneeleebee,Great First Impression!,Just got it and can't stop scanning! Love it so far. An actually USEFUL app for this mom that has a child with milk and wheat intolerances.,
