1,1,2019-05-03T07:08:14.000Z,SubuhiS,Barely average,When you open the app it recommends you buy the Smart Plan - a daily meal plan. You cannot really see anything before you purchase the plan and once you’ve paid you’ll realise it does not provide any recipes just names dishes and gives nutritional information. For example the veg sandwich - what vegetables am I supposed to add for it to get the number of calories the app requires?,"Hey there!

Specifically, I record my water consumption using WaterMinder which in turn stored the information into Apple Health. My weight (and a bunch of other parameters) is recorded using Xiaomi’s Body Composition Scale and Mi Fit app, which in turn stores the same into Apple Health. My BP is recorded using Omron’s BP monitor and app, which stores the information into Apple Health. Most importantly, a plethora of information is collected by my Apple Watch and stored into Apple Health.","Hi Ashish, Could you please write to us at support@healthifyme.com so that we can assist you.

3,4,2020-08-12T14:12:39.000Z,myonecent,Great app. Some basic features could be free though,It’s great that we can track calories on this app and there are a wide range of Indian dishes here which really aren’t there on any other apps because most of them aren’t Indian apps. But it would be really great if the adding a custom meal is not a paid feature.,

When my body health went slightly out of control, I have downloaded this app; and within a week, Healthifyme has brought me back in track and disciplined my daily food regime. Ria is an excellent source of feedback and knowledge. Due to this disciplined approach, I have lost 8 kgs and went back to my normal self. Over the time, one enjoys entering details of what he or she has eaten, everyday and becomes conscious of what’s good and what’s not good, what are good calories and what are bad calories. That’s what I love about this app. Yes, I had very miserable time with the nutritionist. None of them were prompt and consistent.",

Initially along with few exercises, I was able to come down from 79 kg to 65 kg in 6 months. I track every food and drink that I consume. Exercises are also tracked. Keeping track and seeing the excess calories you tend to take some days reminds you of your target goal. This app surprisingly has almost all the food in the database, even the very rare ones you think may not be there. I recommend this app to those who plan to bring down their weight. I must also say that simply controlling your calorie intake alone will not help. You definitely have to do some form of exercises as well for faster change.",

On top of multiple ""technical errors"",  the support usually replies after 10-20 minutes, and nobody is crazy enough to sit there for that long with an open screen. I paid 200 AUD without any clarification of the amount because on the app it said 143 dollars so i assumed i was paying the same. When i found out i requested a cancellation and refund as soon as i purchased. And there starts three days of stress and me wondering whether these guys just ripped me off of my money. No response from the customer service at all, no clarification as to where the hell my money is. As of this day, my i am still waiting for my refund. It has been three days since i requested the cancellation, which should be otherwise done on the same day if there was such a thing as good customer service.",

However, it was vice-versa of that... actually, I was supposed to seek their appointment based on slot available in their schedule. Mostly they were all booked. Later after lot of request I got my coaches changed to those who are comparatively free. I lost my one month in this process. Later, the diet coach shared one diet plan (with maximum 3-4 different dishes in all meals). Just one diet plan continued till the end of the plan. {I paid more than 5000/- for a chart of 1&half page dishes) :(","Hi Yatin, This seems to be extremely distressing.

Signed up for premium plan after some research. Everything went on well till I showed dissatisfaction towards the assigned dietician. Not to blame, but the dietician could not understand my background and asked me to ignore the concerns I raised. The diet plan was never customised to suit my needs and even after repeated requests, the sales person did not even lend an ear to the complaints raised. I did not hear from him again.",

But from past few days, it keeps changing target calorie, water in take etc. So I had lost like 6.4Kgs in 108 days and my target was 72 Kgs. And today it deleted all my data, asked me to set target again. Showed that I am obese and my Ideal weight is 58.8 Kgs. Before that it was 72 Kgs. I am 5’8”. Should I just vanish in air. Calorie target increased to 2600, before it was 1650, then 1800, then 1950. I am really confused. I had also talked with Customer care. My Premium worked for like 15-20 days, then vanished. Kept asking me to set my meal plans, then asked me to buy premium and when I tried that, it says you have already purchased this. I admit that this app has helped me a lot in keeping track of calorie and workouts etc, but these things keep messing up my mind. I have uninstalled it.",

The USP of this app is its extensive database it has got every variety of local food you usually eat along with nutritional info. Hats off thats an achievement in itself.

It would have been better to add health related articles instead.","Hey Priya, Feedback noted!!!!"

112,3,2018-11-12T15:42:59.000Z,Elena447,Calorie mistakes.,It is perfect for people on indian diet as it has virtually all indian dishes in it’s database but it has a lot of calorie mistakes. It tends to underestimate proteins in dishes and overestimate fat and when you match it with Google it turns out wrong so that’s quite a bummer as how would I know if my diet is adequate or not?. Sometimes the live exercise option shuts down or does not reflect in the workout log. Otherwise the app is pretty good.,

Having said this we would genuinely like to know what made you feel this way about our app so that we can assist you.
