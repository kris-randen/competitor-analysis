I tried 6 different apps and this one trounced the competition at the time. That was 3 years ago, and since then, the app has gotten better in many ways.","Hi!

2,5,2021-06-17T13:29:59.000Z,Lambsmurf,Incredible App,I’ve been looking for an app like this for a long time. I had one similar a few years ago but for some reason they discontinued it. The best thing I can say is not only how easy it is to use but that it gives you a A1C average. I won’t know how accurate (close) it is until I go to the dr in late July for my Diabeties (type 2)check up.,
3,5,2020-12-31T17:52:47.000Z,Rodfle,Make tracking easy,New to being diabetic but this app tracks all my blood sugars if you have the Apple Watch it connected to their exercise app and keeps track of that you can log your food quite a heavy little program and if you want you can actually pay for the premium version which gives you unlimited test strips.,Hi! Thank you so much for the positive review! We are so glad you found us and that our app has been helpful for you.
4,4,2020-12-07T22:56:59.000Z,laura_lyonhart,Really good! Could easily be great.,"I’ve been using this app (I pay for the Pro subscription) for over a month now to track my glucose, diet, supplements, and medication for gestational diabetes. I love that it integrates with my Apple Health so it automatically shows how much I’ve exercised, the steps I’ve taken, and even confirms my glucose readings as my Contour Next app also integrates with Apple Health. The automatically generated reports allow me to easily keep my midwife updated on my readings. My one and only complaint and the only reason I’m docking a star is this: why can’t I see my scheduled reminders and update them? Once you input a meal the app allows you to set a reminder. However, once it’s set it does not display that you’ve even set one anywhere within the app or allow you to edit it. I’d also love to be able to set a daily reoccurring timer within this app for my supplements and medication since I also track it here, but there’s none to be found. This would be a really simple add that would take this app up to perfect!","Thank you so very much for your awesome review! We're happy to hear the app has been helping you! We'll be sure to share your feedback with our developers, too."
5,5,2019-11-28T18:06:25.000Z,msantiago1256,I’m simply blown away,"When I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes I went into data overdrive trying to get a hold of the problem and find a solution that works for me and my lifestyle. One of the key things I wanted was a solid, practical, and well designed tracker to help me paint a real world picture of my blood sugar daily. Of course the App Store doesn’t lack for applications and I downloaded nearly a dozen before settling on mySugr.",
6,3,2017-10-27T04:31:58.000Z,awargo4,Easy to use; needs a lot of work,"This app is really easy to use, which is great because I really don’t have any desire to spend my time recording this data. The layout is relatively streamlined and the ability to customize the fields is nice. In a free app. Since I paid for the pro version, I expect some better features:  1) the ability to get rid of that infuriating monster. Stress raises blood sugar. Stop annoying me with that thing. 2) The developer team could really use some help from people skilled at data visualization. The visualizations aside from the color coded entries are useless.  Add better graphs. 3) Add the ability to customize the tag tiles. And why the hell is menstruation on there?  The app knows I’m male. Spend a little time having the app respond better to user data. 4) Get rid of the advertisement on the report in the paid version.  And make it easier to get to the reports. 5) Take advantage of the fact that everyone with an iPhone expect visualizations to be better and more detailed when we rotate the phone. This app does nothing to take advantage of that capability.",Thank you so much for the feedback. We've had a chance to make some pretty awesome updates since October but we're always looking to improve and your suggestions will be passed on to our developers.
7,5,2019-01-12T23:19:48.000Z,sunburntbrain,This is the best diabetes app ever! GET THE BUNDLE!,"I was a diabetic with little control. I had given up. I ran into this app and it all changed.  I started using the app and it was fun. I wanted to use it. I bought the bundle that came with the Accu-Chek Guide Meter and UNLIMITED STRIPS. I started poking my fingers all the time! Wanting that control. My A1C was 9.6. I learned that with more knowledge came more control and an interest in a diabetic diet and lifestyle changes that have helped me noticeably lose weight. I can’t wait to see what my next A1C is. I’m sure it’s going to be a lot better. Oh I forgot. With the bundle comes a Diabetic Educator right in the app. Well worth the 49 dollar investment each month. No appointments needed just message her in the app. If you combine the bundle, a new meter lance and lancets all you can poke strips and an educator you’re making money to save your own life. This was the best medical decision I’ve ever made. Tame your monster! Get MySugr today!",Hi! Thank you so much for the positive review and for sharing about your experience with the mySugr Bundle! We are so glad to hear it has been such a great experience for you. Keep up the great work and we've got your back :)
8,5,2019-02-04T12:55:31.000Z,BigV1952,Helped me drop my A1C from a 11.5 to 5.5 in six mos!,"When I first got diagnosed it was really scary, and overwhelming  time. This app gave me something to concentrate on, it really helped me to log all of my eating and glucose records easily. Six months later now, things have gotten better for me and my need for logging every meal became less and less necessary and less testing too under Dr’s advice. I still enjoy doing a daily log in the morning, I enjoy the apps giggle when I log a 98 it’s a great way to start your day on a healthy step in controlling your sugar . I feel every newly diagnosed person should use this app, the free one was great, but the paid gives you the  photo option which I use to take a picture of my meter Incase I key it in wrong. Essentially this is a very important tool for recording your monitoring of your blood glucose and diet intake to help you lower your A1C.",Thanks so much for the awesome review and feedback!! The free version is awesome! The Pro version offers more logging options and is just $2.99 a month...less than a cup of coffee :)
9,4,2020-10-22T13:42:57.000Z,Kellymomof3,"Awesome app, pricey","We have enjoyed using this app to track our newly diagnosed t1 son. Over the three weeks we have been using it, we were able to earn the pro version by “taming the monster “ by logging 50 points worth of activity a day, for a week. This was not difficult as we logged every BG check, the insulin he received, what he ate and when, and how active to was. It has been a great help to us to have this format to do it. That hearing said, if we didn’t earn the pro version by our frequent use, there’s no way we would have bought the pro version ourselves. Everything with diabetes will nickle and dime you and this app is no exception. But we would have kept using the limited version indefinitely because it is totally adequate for our needs and we enjoyed that version as well. I’d recommend this app to anyone looking to keep good track of their or their child’s diabetes, especially before you are approved for and using your CGM or pump.",
10,4,2018-11-14T06:48:33.000Z,joanwolk,"Great app, missing one convenience for gestational diabetes","This app is great overall. I’m using for gestational diabetes, and at my first meeting with a diabetes counselor, they were really impressed with the data report mySugr generated.

11,5,2019-01-28T08:23:56.000Z,kayt.e.k8,"Super easy, very grateful!",This app is crisply legible w/out the add-ons and is also free from advertisements! Had this app on my droid and have recently switched back to iOS and it performs exactly the same way between both systems. Type 1/ accu check- aviva; use basic edition of app. Love the update options but currently have great insurance and endrocrinoligical care. Bug issues and/or crashing/freezing have never been an issue between both systems. Incredibly grateful to have found this app as any other app I’ve used in the past will allow about ten logs before demanding a monetary upgrade. This app allows everything you need for free and saves unlimited logs since account setup. This tells me that whoever created this app finds that the health and well being of a diabetic means more than monetary success; otherwise they wouldn’t offer SO MUCH FOR FREE! Thank you thank you thank you!,Hi! Wow! Thank you so much for the positive review and all the positive feedback. We are so glad to hear that our app has been so helpful for you and that your experience has been so great so far! We are so happy to be able to offer such a great service for free and we are so glad to hear you appreciate it. Keep up the great work and we've got your back!
12,5,2019-06-08T17:04:02.000Z,PennRev,Thanks for making a more abundant and long life possible!,Really enjoying this app!! For the first time in 20 years my diabetes is under control!  My doctor LOVES the detailed reports! I love the ease of operation and entries. My eyesight is improving and I am losing weight! I do not feel hungry all the time and I have a tangible way of seeing my progress.,
13,5,2019-07-30T03:44:02.000Z,ViiViiV,My most used app.  Love it.,"I use this for tracking glucose, blood pressure, carb intake, and a1c.  I use another app to log my food and calculate carbs and I manually enter the carb values in mySugr.  I also use another app for tracking activity and for tracking my weight, and mySugr imports this data with no problem via Apple Health.",
14,4,2019-07-21T14:34:21.000Z,HailieC,Better than paper,"When my doctor handed me a piece of paper, I searched for something better and found MySugr. It tracks almost everything I need. I was surprised that my diabetes educator had not heard of it. I like that it estimates the A1C and the monster is cute. I like the idea of the package but I don’t need unlimited test strips-just the coach. Not worth paying extra for. To make it perfect, integrate with MyFitnessPal so I don’t have to enter meals in 2 places AND integrate with Freestyle Libre. This is such a need that I suspect you could charge a reasonable amount for it. I rarely use my Accucheck meter which does integrate. I would also like the ability to enter my own medicine not on the pre-defined list. The last thing I would like is the ability to rearrange or hide some of the icons. I rarely use some and have to go over 2 screens for those I use often. Great concept just keep improving.",
15,2,2021-08-09T23:15:19.000Z,NonnaAsh,Could be so much more useful,"If this is the only app you use, it’s possibly adequate. If you track with multiple apps, it’s next to useless. CGM Data is not entered into the logbook other than as a graph. This means none of that information is used in estimating A1c, or other parts of the app. My meters (Accuchek Guide/GuideMe/Connect) often fail to import readings, necessitating multiple attempts. It would be easier to just keep a paper logbook, which is what this app is supposed to eliminate and make easier.",
16,4,2020-05-04T13:20:45.000Z,Mllertyvy,Great so far!,"I’ve only been using this app for about a week.  It’s been working well, however I’m confused about the difference between the free version and the pro version. What are the differences between the two? What are the added benefits of the pro version? I Love how well it syncs with my AccuChek Guide monitor.  I don’t need a coach but that’s the only upgrade option offered to me in the app ... so I’m not upgrading because I’m afraid I’ll loose all my other data!  Also, I like the challenges, but they can be confusing to figure out.  Like the Greenhorn one ... I keep thinking I’m doing it correctly ... but then it’s telling me I’m failing!  Over all a solid app ... but user direction could be improved. I also love the reports feature and how easy it is to use the app — it’s nice that the free option is so robust too (as I mentioned above, I’d upgrade but I’m afraid of loosing my data).",Thanks for the review!! :) Here's a link where you can find the differences between the mySugr basic and pro versions https://www.mysugr.com/en/diabetes-app
17,3,2019-08-08T20:57:40.000Z,BlackbirdFlying13,What happened?,"I’ve been using this app and the subscription service since my diagnosis in 2015. Overall it’s been an amazing app for my needs BUT in the last few months it’s become really buggy, unbelievably slow and crashes all of the time. I turned off it’s access to apple health thinking that would help as it often cant seem to  connect, but nope...still slow like 1999 dialup. It’s a dilemma  because I have so much data there that I don’t want to switch to a different app but it’s getting super frustrating to deal with a long wait for every field I fill out, then a crash that makes me have to fill it out all over again...all while my food is getting cold. I have a iPhone XR that’s caught up with all updates and this is the only app on my phone that seems to have a problem so I don’t think it’s my phone. I don’t know. I do love this app otherwise though so I’m hoping something gets worked out.",
18,5,2019-10-31T01:04:58.000Z,nbette,"Excellent, but","This application is excellent. I can use it to track symptoms, meals, and activities throughout the day. I wish I could use it as my main app to have everything consolidated, but I’m disappointed that I can’t link the Fitbit app or the device, the Cronometer app, or MyFitnessPal app. I also wish that it had more options for people with hypoglycemia, such as reactive hypoglycemia or dumping syndrome. It only has different types of diabetes as options. I’m also great value to pay $49 for the premium membership considering the unlimited test strips that will pay for themselves many times over if you need to test multiple times a day. However only Accu-Chek is supported. The cheaper memberships are good too and reasonably priced. In general, this app is fantastic.",
19,4,2020-10-10T20:41:25.000Z,Auntie mom,User friendly...for the most part,"I was diagnosed only a few months ago so I knew next to nothing about diabetes let alone the management of it. This app is pretty straight forward, easy to use, and most importantly (to me), it doesn't take forever to enter your data. I like the feature that allows you to list medications and how many pills you're supposed to. The downfall of that feature is that it is not the easiest to set up and the instructions aren't clear. However, once it's done, all you have to do is scroll down to the medication and # of pills. By the way, if you have more than one medication,  you can't use the ”next” tab. You have to use the down arrow (to the left of the ”next” tab) then select the next medication. Overall, I would still recommend this app.",
20,5,2017-12-02T21:14:25.000Z,DystoniaSucks,Luvin' it,"Went with the AccuChek Guide meter w/unlimited strips bundle deal for $40 a month. Received my meter today, had been poking around the app prior to receiving it though, and so far, I'm delighted with it - meter connected easily without any issues at all, so bonus. Lots of good features to help recognize patterns and log everything easily - access to well known CDEs is a great bonus for the paid version of the app. Can't beat the deal offered, it's really helpful for those uninsured or under insured with high co-pays or tight restrictions on allotted amount of strips. The app is a great tool to use to aid in management of type 1 or type 2 Diabetes, and could even potentially be useful for those with hypoglycemia to help spot patterns with foods and drops.",Thanks so much for the great review! We're so happy to hear that mySugr is helping :)
21,5,2019-08-21T16:46:01.000Z,Punmaster.Rose,A steal!! UPGRADE IMMEDIATELY,"Two words: UNLIMITED STRIPS. The deluxe features are great for notating the day so you can notice patterns and the detailed reports look so nice. Im able to print them or email them to my doctor, and this app gives an estimated A1C once you give it enough data. They send you a Bluetooth enabled glucometer, which has simplified my life. If you have a continuous glucose monitor, mySugr links up with it. My diabetes educator is the first healthcare professional ive met with T1D just like me, she’s extremely accessible. I don’t feel judged for once and my diabetes is in MY control now. And i adore how the app lets me name my “diabetes monster”. Externalizing my condition like that really helps me disconnect from my diabetes and see it as a virtual pet i have to take care of. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS ENOUGH",
22,5,2020-04-09T14:23:12.000Z,watchursix,Great way to track BG,"I am absolutely horrible at tracking my blood sugars and keeping up with the numbers so every time I do get asked at the endo I either 1. Have missing blood sugars on the sheet for my 14 day report or 2. Have blood sugars but the times are sporadic so I have to eyeball when breakfast,lunch, and dinner was. With this app I literally have all the times and the exact blood sugars and I can even put in my bolus amounts for my meals, overall great app for being free and even if you do put a buck or two into it you get a whole lot more including graphs and labels for what you where doing when you checked, I would even dare to say it beats some of the sensor trackers in terms of graphing so long as you put your information in everyday, great app overall!",
23,5,2020-08-01T16:34:16.000Z,Dolores S,Keeps me on track,"Great app that automatically sends my blood sugar readings from my Accu-Guide meter to my iPad and iPhone so that I (and my doctor) can easily review them at a later time without using up my meter’s battery.  Also love the fact that I can track my medications so that I will be able to see if I remembered to take them, especially my insulin since it can’t be tracked by a daily pill box.  Also love that I can keep track of other health items, like my weight, blood pressure, exercise log, just to name a few, all in one app.  Also love being able to share 2 week or 3 month report, showing an approximate A1c score if I’ve recorded enough blood sugar readings.  Wish I would have had this meter and app sooner.",
24,4,2019-11-18T23:39:56.000Z,Larry Seltzer,"Comprehensive, easy to use app for sugar mgmt","I needed to track my blood glucose and food..this is free and does way more than that, offering summaries, charts, and reports - those are a paid feature. I got a trial of the pro version and used it to print out PDF and Excel versions of my report, which I have to my endocrinologist. He was able to see the results easily. I’m continuing to use it. Since the data is all online, I can use the app on multiple devices and sync.",
25,5,2019-10-07T13:20:11.000Z,mfethers,"Would have been 5 stars, if more devices synced","***updated review** They have added more brands of testing kits.  I also asked them to be able to delete test results en masse, instead of 1 @ a time. They agreed & said they will try to get that done.  For now,  customer service walked me thru deleting the app & old testing info (which did not want to delete) then reloading the app.  They still have not included my One Touch Verio IQ (which is only test kit I could get thru UnitedHealthCare). I like this app, & use it multiple times each day.  Being able to print out my reports is very helpful @ Dr visits. It is silly, but I enjoy the little green monster's sounds and sayings.  Also, I wish more diabetic Rx options were included (like Byetta).",Thank you for the positive review! I will include a link to our page that shows all the devices you can sync. You're suggestion for more Rx options is a great idea and will be passed on as we're always looking to improve :)

Tame the Monster,"I’ve seen many used more than a few but I have to say this one has kept me doing the tedious logging with all of the tame the monster fun. Cheers for making something a daily painful chore into fun. Once again I suggested to start logging my days for the next couple of weeks. I dreaded the paper trail options and felt apps weren’t gonna give enough. Yet to my amazement, I am so grateful to have stumbled upon this app. It has made a HUGE world of difference on my logging.  And my life living DB-MONSTER!! NOW I look forward in being the slayer in my own story and enjoy it most when I have tamed the BEAST.",Thanks for the awesome review!!

The indicators or what you ate, what you were doing, etc. make it really easy to determine what causes spikes and what helps level spikes out. The ability to have my sugar levels synced to multiple devices means that I don’t have to worry if I am somewhere with only a single device.

28,5,2020-01-07T23:34:48.000Z,sophr452,No complaints,"Honestly I have no complaints and it’s super easy to use.  Very self explanatory as well but even if it wasn’t I love how they have the support for any questions.  The best thing is that my son, the one we use this app for, can and does put in his own information quite often.  Last and I feel most importantly, when we were newly diagnosed and looking for a simple way to track all of the information the doctors would need, this app was suggested and when we showed it to the doctor he said this was the best one he had seen.  He said it was very comprehensive and loved the report capability which we still continue to take to his doctor at every appointment.",Thanks for the great review!! :)
29,5,2019-09-07T13:59:42.000Z,Laurlament,Please make more “add on” options,"The only option to get the pro edition is $50/month and includes unlimited strips. For someone that doesn’t have insurance that covers strips this option is fantastic. If you would make it so that the pro option is available without the unlimited strips that would be great!! Please oh please developer gods hear my humble request! Aside from that this app is the best thing that has happened to me since i was told i had to use insulin. Its great to hold yourself responsible for everything you eat, to keep track of your meds and everything else you do during the day. Oh and the little diabetes critter is so adorable and makes having to do this fun.",
30,4,2017-09-21T12:27:38.000Z,tBasco,Good App,"I was looking for a simple app for just tracking glucose levels and this was it. It takes awhile to get used to it but once I figured it out, it's easy. You just have to spend the time to log the info. Tip: if you don't have a BT monitor and have to log by hand, this app syncs with Health and if you have another device like a BP monitor, it's syncs and has the date already in there to record the BG. Just noticed recently that sometimes the app does not transfer over to Health. Check you data.",

It allows logging of pertinent data, as well as excellent analysis. It gives continuous feedback about how you're doing. There are challenges to help keep you motivated and on track. And designers are open to suggestions. I love this thing. It's the best app I've found for logging diabetes data, especially if you're on a pump.  I've been using this for several months now, and I'm still using it!  It keeps me interested and provides useful data and analysis. I can print out PDFs for my CDE, which helps us fine-tune insulin for life. This app is so helpful!",Thank you so much for the positive review!!

I understand charging for the personal help (which I do not need or want).","Thank you for the great review and feedback! The mySugr bundle is $39 a month which includes unlimited test strips as well as a certified diabetes coach. There is also a Pro version that's just $2.99 a month...less than a cup of coffee :) There are a lot of us that work here and also live with diabetes as well and can totally understand you about the costs, unfortunately, that is as low as we can offer at the time.

This app easily allows me to post my morning daily blood sugar. More importantly, it makes me count my carbs and control my diet. I love that it allows me to push all the information over to the Apple health app. This allows me to combine information from my scale and other apps to give me a full picture of my health and activity. I would love it to provide me the A1C as stated but I only stick once a day. So evidently I don’t have the appropriate number of sticks to allow that to happen. That is the reason for four stars instead of five - if after several months of blood sugars I have enough sticks to allow the A1C average to happen then I would recommend five stars.",Thanks for the awesome review and feedback!! We're so happy to hear that the app is helping :) The estimated A1c does require three inputted readings a day to produce an accurate estimate.

I use mySugr for 2-3 week bursts at a time to get my T1D back on track if I’ve been slacking. I have recommended it to several people and the occasional blog/Instagram post.

It syncs with the Dexcom and allows me to track patterns, adjusting insulin for various factors. I love that I'm able to search based on keys words I’ve entered (e.g. food or restaurant name) or the type of entry. I use it extensively and as a result his A1C results from his Endo have always typically matched that of the estimated A1C that the app shows you. Since diagnosis his A1C has decreased significantly, and although this is also a result of using the Dexcom and his pump, this app has also played a large part in it.

I’ve gone through different meters and pumps for years and currently I’m taking shots of Humalof with Tresiba as my long-acting at night. This app is a perfect way for me to see trends (such as going low in the mornings) so I can discuss them with my endocrinologiat and adjust my routine.

Other apps might have more features, such as a built in carb catalogue, but were so tedious and expensive I didn’t use it. This app gives you a number of features free, and if you use it will give you the pro version for free, at least for a while. If you decided to subscribe to the pro version, it is significantly cheaper than the other apps I’ve used. I am hoping that they start including more of the challenges, as I find those to be a fun way to motivate myself to stay on top of my sugars.

I have wanted to get my 8 year old more involved in tracking his levels and meals and this Diabetes Monster app (as likes to call it) is just perfect. The use of the sounds on the little monsters when you feed the app is his favorite part, but the entry guides for noting readings, meals, insulin units, etc is so easy for him to follow.",Thanks so much for the great review!

I wrote to mysugr and asked them to ""flip a switch"" allowing my verio to apple health to register as blood sugars and integrate with DEXCOM.  Yippee!  One more step to set us mixed tech users free, get the bolus wizard information from MiniMed care link and it will all be on one location.

After leaving some major stress behind a year ago, my numbers are finally coming down. I have had to relearn what I can eat as I have avoided many foods for decades.

I helps me keep me track my blood glucose with lots of tools a bit of humor. The little monster is so funny and helps me keep my perspective when I get a higher reading (fortunately not too often) and it says “It happens”. I went for the pro version to get the exported charts. I have been testing daily for almost 3 years now so I don’t keep that detailed a diary to get 50 points a day.

The responses that the developer gives me is for someone who is a rocket scientist at this. I finally quit paying for the full version. I always tell myself that I will pay for the full version when it finally has no bugs with apple health. But it has been around three years and no changes. I also wish that I could connect somehow with my freestyle libre 14 days. Every day it gives me the message that I need to restart my phone in order to get it to work correctly. The funny thing is that I restart my phone every single day at the end of the day regardless and it still happens.","Oh no! We're so sorry to hear you're having trouble syncing your phone.

Is has all the items I want to keep track of regarding my health. The trend line and average A1C tracking is awesome. Just one thing. I also like the other items the App is capable of but I think $49 a month is a bit steep. I could see $20 a month or perhaps an outright $250 per year. The additional information is valuable, just not at $49 a month. Overall though, the App is the best I’ve seen that does what I, and perhaps other diabetics need it to do.",

The app also integrates with Apple Health so you can bring in Dexcom CGM data, and I can also bring in my Strava activity data.",Thanks for the awesome review!!

So I see this as a wonderful way to manage my numbers, and I give my full appreciation to the mySugr team, and I hope for them to even have a system where your numbers are automatically done for you. As it would be simple, the person just has to put in the ratio of their insulin doses",Thank you for the great review! We love hearing that mySugr can help :)

I recommend it to other Diabetics, any chance I get!  I do wish that there was an option saying 1 hour after meal and another saying 2 hours after meal which is how a lot of Diabetics check their blood sugar.  There is an “after meal” but it doesn’t say how long.

I like the expanded pump logging options like temp basals.

I have struggled with finding out where I can improve to get my a1c down without a sensor (I personally do not like them) so this is helping!","Thank you for the great review and feedback!

There is some evidence that this tends to lead to prediabetes, which seems to be what is occurring with me. I am finding the mySugr app to be very helpful in tracking glucose levels, and, hopefully, I can do what I can to prevent it. The mySugr app is well designed and rather amusing, with the Sugar Monster.

I would love to come back but I need to track my carbs and other nutritions.  Since Loose It is no longer allowed to communicate with my sugar it doesn’t help me. Is there any plans to bring back this communication? Or, is there any other way to get the carb/nutritional information from the Health app into my sugar. It’s up to you guys wether I can come back. Right now one drop does allow loose it information to come over. However I like your reporting a little better.

If you’re willing to pay an arm and a leg for the full deal of extras is just crazy and not worth it to me since I only check my level once a day, first thing in the morning. Maybe if I was one that had to check my levels a few times to several times a day, it might be worth it. Plus there is no features to allow you to repeat your meds or other information from the previous day to speed up your entries. Also supposedly it should link with your Apple health, but it doesn’t.

The graph is so helpful; I email it to my doc at check-up time, so it's great for her too! Fabulous customer service—that’s what finally convinced me to write this review. She was so helpful when I didn’t understand something. I will recommend this to every diabetic I meet! Thank you! 🙌🏻","Wow, thank you so much for this review! <3 We are so honored you think so highly of us. We are so glad you had a good experience with our customer service team and we really appreciate all the recommendations! Thank you."
132,5,2019-03-05T15:12:49.000Z,LayneRed14,CDE recommended for a reason,"As a type 1, my diabetic educator suggested I start logging my carb consumption and BG etc with this specific app now that I’m expecting. Logging an entry is very easy and easy to edit, plus you can enter as much or as little info as you please. Very easy to share reports with her and my doctor as well so they know I’m taking this seriously (and they don’t have to decipher my handwriting). I’m using a Freestyle Libre to test my BG FYI.","Hi! Thank you so much for the positive review. We are so happy to hear our app has been helpful for you. Haha! Yes, not having to decipher handwriting is definitely a plus."
133,5,2020-03-22T19:55:00.000Z,Isildür,"Easy to use, thankfully","I’m new to having type 2 diabetes, but needed an easy way to log information so I could keep track of everything. This has made it incredibly simple for me and makes it really easy to show my doctors what I’ve been up to. I like the customization ability on the data entry page and also the drop down past day info feature.",
134,4,2019-11-07T19:16:40.000Z,Laniwbug2122,Helpful tool,"I like all of the options they give you to enter factors you want to keep track of, and you can simplify those fields by removing them if you want.",
135,3,2020-04-21T16:13:04.000Z,Ford-Mack,MySugr Review,"Not so easy to set up and understand. The Accu-Chek Guide Me meter lost connection with my iPhone and I haven’t figured out how to reconnect it. That should not be so difficult! And I don’t want to waste a lot of time on the phone with a stranger. So, don’t call. I’ll just go back to my old way of keeping track. I don’t want to be part of some world-wise study that someone else will use to get rich. If you want that kind of data from me, then start paying me. I’m doing all the work on this end. I will be deleting your app. Goodbye.",
136,4,2019-09-09T00:53:22.000Z,gwh57,Not so enthralled,I really really like the app except for one thing – I don’t really like having an app laughing at me when my sugar is high. I get it- you’re trying to motivate people. Unfortunately some of us just aren’t able to get extremely tight control without experiencing constant hypo events. I figure if I can get it in the ballpark most days I’m ahead of the curve. Maybe do away with a little animations and sound effects and just let people log their blood sugar.,
137,5,2021-01-09T17:58:06.000Z,BlueEyedLotus,It's cheerful and easy to use,"I'm newly diagnosed with type two, and I'm still fighting that horrible feeling that comes with knowing you have this overwhelming problem to face.",
138,5,2021-05-30T14:59:32.000Z,TeeTee's Treasures,Great for keeping track,I like the picture function most. I keep track of everything to show my doctor because portion size is my enemy. I was keeping a weitten log but this will be way more accurate at my visit because the dr will actually be able to see my plates.,
139,4,2021-06-06T16:41:00.000Z,jo2105,"Awesome app, just one suggestion!","I just downloaded this app, and I’m already in love with it. By far, it’s the best app for tracking sugars that I’ve used.",
140,5,2018-03-04T15:20:23.000Z,Nailbender63,I love this app!,I use this app every single day to track my blood sugar and I love it. The reports you can generate for your own use or to give to your doctor are great. Decisions on adjusting insulin doses need to be based on facts not guess work!,Thanks so much for the positive review! We're so happy to hear that mySugr is helping :)
141,4,2018-10-20T01:57:00.000Z,501kimkat,Nice tool for diabetics,"I just got diagnosed with diabetes last week. Currently my doc only wants me to test prior to breakfast and 2hrs after my biggest meal. This app makes it super easy to record my sugars. The little monster makes me laugh especially since I also suffer from major depression. My only complaint is there doesn’t seem to be a way to record what I’ve eaten, only the number of calories. Other than that, I think it’s worth downloading","Hello! Thank you so much for the positive review and for sharing your story. We are so happy that our app has made you smile. In regards to entering what you have eaten there is a spot right under ""Carbs"" where you can enter ""Meal"" and ""Food Type"". Please let us know if you are having trouble finding these entries, we are happy to help here or on our support line at support@mysugr.com."
142,5,2018-11-02T05:48:25.000Z,EvaLStu,So simple! Great motivator,"MySugr helps me keep track of everything I do and it allows me to stay on top of my diabetes. There’s so many easy tools in the app to personalize each entry. Of all the sugar journal apps I’ve tried, MySugr always wins hands down because of how simple it is and how motivating it is. Never laggy, either. Which is super nice, as well as the fun colors and concepts that makes diabetes a little more enjoyable.",Hi! Wow! Thank you so much for the positive review :) We are so happy to be your favorite! Thanks again for the great review and keep fighting the diabetes monster! We've got your back.
143,5,2020-05-25T05:41:00.000Z,meslo66,Nice!,I’m loving MySugr. I’ve been all over the board with my blood sugar. Since my monitor is linked with MySugr all I have to do is use it. Many times I wouldn’t have paper or a log book so it never worked out and many times I just gave up. Now even if I’m out my phone and MySugr communicate and no hassle.,
144,5,2019-11-17T06:04:24.000Z,MzFireKatt,So far so good,I’ve been using this app for a couple weeks now. I love how easy it is to use. Looking forward to learning more about the app as I go. The interactive “monster” is just cute enough that I could see kids enjoying using this app to track their levels.... a bright spot in what might otherwise be a trying time. I’m actually having fun trying to “tame my monster” :),
145,5,2021-01-07T17:11:30.000Z,MaurokNC,Great tool,"By far the best diabetes app out there. This app imports my glucose levels directly from my AccuCheck meter every single time without issue unlike the actual AccuCheck app that I had to mess with about every other time and re-pair the meter and my phone at least 3 times a week. mySugr strangely has never had a single problem and I’ve only had to pair my meter once, and that was the first time.",
146,3,2021-02-16T00:19:25.000Z,Calexg,"Love the Giggles, But...","For the yearly price this app is far too expensive to just be cute (do we really need all those cutesy icons which I rarely use?) and it’s basically easy to use, but sorely lacks in convenience. I refuse to become a Subscriber again until I don’t have to use another app or go online to calculate my carbs in order to calculate my Bolus dosing - that’s a real pain when I’m typically short on time and am trying to keep a tighter rein on my BG. Having to retrieve my carb info elsewhere is why I won’t give this app five stars",
147,5,2020-09-20T14:16:18.000Z,Dunnoboutit,Good for tracking,"I’m just starting to test each morning. I like the app because it makes it easy for me to track my numbers. Also, you can track how you are feeling, if you’ve eaten or exercised, etc. Once you start recognizing how your body is feeling, after you’ve eaten, or based on what’s going on in your day, you can get a better sense if you are high, low or normal.",
148,5,2020-06-01T04:36:13.000Z,4TeamRE,Thank you for helping me take control of my life,"This is a great app. I recently became diabetic and this app has all the tools to help me manage and monitor my condition. I use it in conjunction with myfitnesspal to monitor what Im eating and the carb impact to my blood sugar. I decided to upgrade to the premium version so that I can fully record my meals with photos. I pray this tool helps me to put my diabetes in remission. Great job to the developers, thank you 🙏🏾",
149,4,2020-05-27T23:32:23.000Z,A very new diabetic,"Overall great service, wish I could be more detailed without upgrading","Useful for dietician visits, way easier alternative to keeping a journal (in my opinion), extremely easy to use, wish it had more options or at least a notes section to be more detailed without paying (which I understand is how the world goes round but do I really have to pay to tap a button that I did housework or tried a new food?)",
150,4,2018-03-22T19:59:51.000Z,RyanFamily98,"Great, but bigger fonts needed","I love the app. Still learning to use it, but the important part, recording my blood sugar is incredibly simple. The only problem I have is that the font size can’t be changed (I searched). For people with diabetes, who are prone to vision problems, a bigger font would’ve been a better choice. An option to choose our own would be even better. But otherwise, I’m happy. I seriously recommend it!!",Thanks so much for the positive review! You can change the font size in your phone setting and it should reflect in the app. I would suggest making it larger and trying bold.

151,4,2018-11-18T08:48:37.000Z,iilynn,I can’t thank you enough,"I just found out about this app from my dietician. I can’t thank her enough. With my crazy busy schedule and life, it was hard for me to manage or remember to input my numbers and track what I eat. This app is amaaaazing omg. Only complaint I have is that I wish the numbers would input and auto sync faster. My device is brand new but it seems to lag. I’ll have to keep turning it on and off. That’s why I gave it 4 stars",Thanks for the positive review!! I'm sorry to hear you're having problems with syncing your machine. If the problem persists please feel free to reach out to our awesome customer support team support@mysugr.com and they should be able to fix the problem in no time :)
152,5,2019-05-24T16:30:38.000Z,snowrose2,Log,For the beer lol.  It is a handy app makes it much easier for my doctor to keep up with my readings he can scroll down and see them much better than paper logs and reading my tester. I like the meal logs myself. The app makes it much easier for me to track what makes my sugars pop up when food is our enemy but one cannot live without food or carbs,"Hi! Thank you so much for the positive review :) We are glad it has been easier for you and your doctor than using paper logs, we think it is a lot better too!"
153,5,2020-06-09T18:45:55.000Z,SolarBeagle,Nice record keeping app,"I have the accuchek guide meter and this app helps keep all the data together, plus I can export it to excel. (It should also work as a generic logbook for any glucose meter I suppose.) Also it has helped me track my carb intake and insulin dosing to see patterns on a single screen, which is nice too. Wish they would unlock the Bolus Calculator for the US, but I guess the FDA needs to ‘ok’ that. Keep up the good work!",
154,4,2021-04-17T14:57:43.000Z,Sculpto,Comprehensive and easy to use,I have been using MySugr for several mont. Very pleased with its straightforward entry. The integration with Apple health and other health apps is what makes this app more useful than other logging apps.,"Thank you so much for your feedback and great suggestion, we really appreciate it!"
155,5,2020-12-14T15:55:01.000Z,mcmaori,Exporting reports to my care team is a breeze!,"This app is so easy to use and the graphics make it easy to follow what different entries are: eg color-coded blood sugar values to track when in and out of range, a color for insulin entry, a color for carbs. This applies to both the graphics in the trending setting and in the reports. I can’t think of anything I would add to improve the ease of use of this app.",Thank you so very much for your review! We're happy to hear you enjoy the app!
156,4,2020-02-06T01:44:17.000Z,BfbsLL,MySugr,"I like the app, it’s simple to use and is quick to add an entry.  For enhancements I would like the ability to add a note to the entry I made for items that are out of the norm and connect to my Fitbit where I’m tracking my calories in/out and physical activities.  I’d also like to be able to use the microphone to make entries especially when I forget a few days in a row, that part is time consuming when you have 15 entries to make.",Thanks for the review!! We love feedback and are constantly looking for ways to improve.

158,2,2021-02-21T17:41:11.000Z,Fatty 4,Have to pair frequently.,"In October 2019, I discovered the software and it was a very useful tool at the beginning. As times goes on, for no reason, the data cannot connect with the iPhone from the meter. It kept dropping and had to pair them again and again. I had contacted the customer service many times and before the customer service responded back to me, I was able to pair the meter again. Now I have been trying to pair the meter with my phone in the last few days with no avail even changing the meter with new batteries.",Hi there! Please send us an email at support@mysugr.com we would love to help you get your devices paired once again.
159,4,2021-04-04T15:42:47.000Z,Bernt Fartens,Pictures & Notes,Love that mySugr allows  note taking & pictures. This is great for identifying which food had a stronger reaction to blood sugar spikes. Also when on the go can look back at picture of portions and more accurately log. Also helps remember so I’ve become more accurately intuitive of carb affects on my blood sugar.,
160,5,2018-07-13T02:43:01.000Z,ShannonHazleton,Useful and super User-friendly,"I’m really appreciating the way this app is making my complicated journey with Gestational Diabetes easier. Logging my numbers is simple and fast and I appreciate the options to customize my entries by noting wether the reading was fasting, post meal, etc., while also being able to list exactly what I ate. I am pleased enough to upgrade. Thanks so much for a useful tool.",Thanks so much for the positive review!! We're so happy to hear that the app is helping you through gestational diabetes.

161,5,2018-12-01T23:51:07.000Z,Huckthe1,Good way to record blood sugar,I have used this app for a few weeks now and it’s nice way to record my blood sugar. I am newly diagnosed so anything to help with this process is good. My machine records this but it’s nice to graph what’s going on and to see what I have ate or what exercise is doing what to my blood sugar. Do wish there was a way to see the entire graph and run different reports but bed app I’ve found so far,"Hi! Thank you so much for the positive review and we are so glad you found us!

Also it could be a five but after the first week or two of having app I cannot get logged in online either. Keeps telling me to delete my cookies. I even tried on a brand new laptop and no luck. It was the first site went to and gave same error.

164,4,2020-05-31T15:04:57.000Z,hattette,Very good app,It keeps all of the info I want in one place. The charts are very good to more easily assess your trends. The one thing I wish is that it took data from Apple Health and reported the info I manually enter back to Apple Health. I have other apps that use the same data. It would be nice not to have to manually enter the data multiple times. But this app is the best I have found for organizing and visually presenting the data.,
165,5,2019-11-23T21:09:06.000Z,Weight 4 it,Sugr that helps my blood sugar,"This app says it’s easy and fun. It actually is both. More than that, after only the first two weeks, it’s helping me see how to impact my A1c in a positive way. After trying dozens of more complicated apps, I’ve finally found one that links to my meter, uploads fast as a breath, and gives me the chance to track actual important information. Sweet Sugr!!",
166,5,2021-03-03T03:02:55.000Z,EatmyToe1!,So Cool,I was not sure at the beginning but it so nice to have a record all located together.  As a diabetic recognizing patterns with my sugars really is key to regulating my eating and foods.  This allows me to easily see several sugar reading all together do seeing patterns in sugar spikes or dips is awesome. And it’s just an added bonus to have blood pressure handy too. Great for giving information to your doctor.  Just a Great App !!,
167,4,2020-10-31T02:10:17.000Z,Chief Bob T,Satisfaction Critique,I just use the basic app and record my tests in AM before breakfast and basically fasting all night. My evening testing is two hours after dinner. My ability to track and record results has resulted in my ability to stay below 7 for the last 10 years and without meds. Your app has provided me with that ability. It helps ME to stay in control of my monster. So thank you!!!,
168,4,2020-03-27T18:29:31.000Z,Bobby McC3,Very good. Needs a couple of improvements,"So many great things to say. Love that it integrates with the Accu-Check Guide, but I’ve now switched to the Freestyle Libre and it will not integrate. This is a huge drawback. If I have to pay for pro now I probably won’t I’ll just switch to Freestyle‘s app.",
169,4,2020-02-11T22:44:51.000Z,Danieledgardolopez,Really good but could use some features,I really love this app. Even though I love this app I think it could use some features like more meters that it could connect with I have a ACCU-CHEK Aviva plus and it’s the only one my doctors office could connect to so it kinda hard to get to do it every time . Also if you can you add on to it a desktop version so we could make it more convenient for people who can’t always get to there phone.,
170,5,2019-01-08T19:29:43.000Z,SpindleMonkey,I love this app,"I actually use this app every day to track insulin, carbs, and food and can see how well I’m doing (ok, sometimes I see how poorly I’m doing). The charts are key for me—thank you. I need that visualization. I used to keep a notebook with the same info but no charts and couldn’t understand why I had so much trouble figuring out what was going on. Love your app, love you all for making it!","Hi! Thank you so much for the positive review. We are so glad to hear our app has helped you, seeing your data is so important!"
171,5,2020-12-08T20:54:50.000Z,HappilyHadea,Just right.,"I love this app. I have avoided recording my blood sugar for most of my adult life, in part because of the poor options available that were easy, intuitive and helpful in how they displayed information provided. I am continually appreciative of the way this app is set up and I hope you continue to update it and keep it available to diabetics like me.",
172,4,2020-12-29T21:11:10.000Z,StrangeBlueEyes,Needs coffee,"Having been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, this app has been a great help in tracking my glucose. However, it needs a way to track coffee consumption! I can mark soda or diet soda as part of my meal, but not coffee. Definitely need that adjusted. I will also go for days with no issues, then suddenly I have to re-pair my phone and meter every time I take a reading. It only takes a minute or so, but it can get frustrating.",
173,5,2020-09-02T01:17:46.000Z,Debalina23,Great tool for diabetics,I love this log app. It helps me keep a record of my blood sugars and the amount of insulin I take. The only thing I would change is that I would like to see the app be more compatible with monitors such as the Verio or one touch. Also it cannot import the data from my Dexcom CGM4. I hope that when the 6 comes out it will be compatible with that.,
174,5,2020-05-22T23:13:52.000Z,Billy D Bear 🐻,MySugr great app! Easy to use.,"Tracks almost everything I need. Works well with Apple health. Only missing things are pulse & blood 02 level. I can’t find a way to add medications to the original list I made. Not show stoppers but would be great if I could. Wish list items: would be great to track grams of sugar, sodium & fat with meals. ability to get EKG & Blood Pressure data directly from Kardia app.",
175,5,2020-03-07T23:35:38.000Z,SB02904,Great tracking app,"Tracked manually and entered data in spreadsheet to run analysis. Love the ease of use and intuitiveness of the app. And, having a coach to look over the data with fresh eyes is a plus for giving feedback and suggestions to reach my goal of no meds. I’ve three months to lower my numbers significantly. Using this tracker, I see immediately what the trend is and can identify triggers.",
176,4,2019-11-22T14:19:12.000Z,Busyangel,My sugr helped me take control.,I’m a post operative new diabetic patient on steroids that caused or instigated sudden onset of type two diabetes. So no classes no warning. I went to sleep (anesthesia) normal and woke up a full blown diabetic. This app helped me learn to keep a log of not only my glucose and corrections but of many other metrics important to my recovery. The little chuckling icon was annoying at first but eventually became a comfort as I learned to keep my glucose in check.,
177,5,2020-07-28T23:42:30.000Z,Jolight77,Awesome app,"Great app to keep your sugar checks logged in every time you get a reading. You can add what you ate. How much medication you took. What activities you’ve done, if your just doing your morning check or whatever type of day you just hit an icon that’s already there and it shows what your doing , what your eating, what times. PERFECT app! Highly recommended!",
178,3,2021-08-27T09:55:37.000Z,minaajjsjdkendjdns,it was good until,"This app is excellent, if been using it for a month but now the bolus calculator isn't working and it is forcing me to pay. When this was recommended to me I was told I could pay if I wanted the extra options like the ""fasting"" or ""traveling"" but now I have to pay 27$ for a calculator?? It didn't even say anything about a free trial. I'm very disappointed. At least tell us before hand this wasn't a permanent thing and that we'd have to pay for it.",
179,5,2020-07-22T18:34:31.000Z,RachelWolf,Helpful for a future college student,I’ve been using this app for the past few weeks and it’s really helped me to track everything and make sure I’m putting in carbs. I really enjoy this app and I know it’ll help me keep on track when I’m in school away from home in a few weeks instead of letting everything go crazy.,
180,5,2018-05-25T00:01:31.000Z,mom of a two-year-old T1D,Great app,"This app helps both my husband and I see my son’s numbers with every reading. If one of us is at work and the other is watching my two-year-old T1D, the person at work can also see the numbers and relax a little.  It’s also helped me see a pattern for when his numbers might be consistently high or low, and easily log food intake, too.",We love hearing that mySugr helps kids living with diabetes too!

Sometimes when I have to edit I’m unable to put the numbers in for long acting insulin by tapping on the field. I have to press ‘next’ from previous field to get that field. Additionally it would have been great if the export facility for reports  was free of charge,
183,5,2019-10-11T16:09:19.000Z,Aharper318,Vastly Improved,"I chose this title to represent both the app and my health. This app was crap in the early years, however after my wife became pre-diabetic and borderline obsessed with checking her BG, I decided to give it another go. I’ve gone from maybe checking x/day to at least 3. I’ve noticed a large improvement in my readings and overall health. Super easy to use.",
184,5,2021-01-08T00:33:24.000Z,THIS APP IS HORRIBAL,I love this app,this app is wonderful! it’s extremely helpful when trying to log my numbers especially because normally writing them out is so tiring. plus it estimates your A1c which is helpful at working on getting it down or making sure it stays in good range. the layout of the app is also pleasing and super easy to use!,

Will no longer connect to my meter (yes, I tried everything). It has been really slow and lagging a ton. Now, it will drop my readings suddenly when I add them manually. Really seems like it is a mess right now. I have reversed my diabetes but like to track so I can finally convince my doctor it can be done. May have to try another app.",
186,5,2020-10-09T11:49:07.000Z,Northern Gal 60+,Great App!,This has made my tracking of my blood sugar so much easier and efficient.  Has a lot of additional features that would be helpful to those who have major issues with their BS levels.   I don’t use them but have looked around and these would be very helpful to others.  So glad I found this app.,

The monster is a cute feature and “taming” him gives motivation to log through the day. I do however, wish more of the features came without the premium. It’s a great package deal, but I don’t like that it has to come all together. I would like some more features on the app, but don’t need the whole package.",

204,4,2019-04-25T01:37:28.000Z,aveunalliv,Pretty Cool,I downloaded this app after I heard a friend talk about it and then saw it mentioned in Diabetes Forecast magazine. I like that it shows an estimated hba1c because that keeps me motivated to bring it down! The only thing is: I wish there was a way to have friends on the app. I’m doing an hba1c challenge with diabetic coworkers and it’d be so neat if we could keep tabs on each other and cheer each other on.,

Different types of breakfast items, lunch items and dinner items would be great, this allows one to see exactly what foods effect the A1C. Types of fast foods would be helpful along with types of soft drinks. Ability to add multiple types of foods eaten throughout the day; such as fruits, vegetables, water, and etc. If someone eats multiple burgers, potatoes or sweets throughout the day makes a big difference in numbers. These all play a role in sugar levels.","Thank you for providing your valuable feedback.

If I want to send a report to my health care team it should either be free, because it matters in terms of my diabetes management, or make it $40 or less.

316,2,2019-07-18T03:32:49.000Z,HistoryBuff:),Whaaaatttt the .....,I am newly diagnosed and I’m looking for an app to use so I download your app. The first thing that I see is a pizza for a snack. Diabetics shouldn’t have pizza!!! Then I notice it’s a hamburger and a bowl of noodles As a graphic. What the heck! I feel it is very insensitive to use food graphics that diabetics should be avoiding. A snack could be a slice/wedge of cheese. Lunch could be a salad. Breakfast should be ham and eggs and dinner could be a fish. Honestly I don’t know if I will use your app just because there is a pizza assaulting me visually!!,"Hi there, sorry to hear that you feel this way!

It would be perfect if the developers could add a carb counter of basic food items that would enable us to look up foods quickly. There are a million apps out there that have this but most of them are geared towards keto dieters and really not applicable to PWD.,

1920,5,2019-05-22T17:15:51.000Z,gmb-md,Nice stable app,"Nice stable app for recording sugars and medications and viewing trends. The “slaying the monster” approach is used as a lighthearted incentive (and you can turn off the audio when you tire of it). The free version is definitely useful. The subscription version might be nice if you have a meter that syncs data with mySugr covered by your health plan (mine doesn’t). There are some extra features available in the subscription version (e.g., photos of meals and extra event categories/rationale), which also enable you to “earn” more points to slay the monster.  My largest negative/frustration is the way it defines the minimum number of results for calculating HA1c estimates. My insurance only pays for 3 finger sticks a day (for type II), so even if I have months of data recorded, mySugr will often state it has insufficient data. Most people will visit a doctor during the day, so there will always be a partial day of data (for me that is less than 3 sticks). It does not make sense that it will provide me an estimate of HA1c at 11:59pm, but won’t at 12:01am (2 minutes later), although it has the same amount of data. Based on responses to help tickets, this is currently considered a “feature” rather than a bug. Technically, this would appear to be an easy fix [e.g., using 24 hr periods (rather than “days”) or calculating using the previous full day]. I’m guessing that changing the calculation might require a recertification cost, since it is certified as a medical device, so maybe we will see an improvement in later?",

2920,5,2014-02-21T22:28:14.000Z,FriendlyNeighborhoodDiabetic,Best Diabetes Management App EVER.,"Never, in all the years since I've had type 1 diabetes, have I had a better time taking care of myself than with this app.",
2921,5,2014-03-05T00:41:48.000Z,GlassyLady01,WOW and Double Wow!,"I've been a diabetic almost 20 years and have been on an insulin pump for almost 10 years. I have to admit that my record-keeping had become rather lax. Some of my blood sugars are transmitted to my pump but since I use multiple meters, many values were not in my pump. I thought I was remembering to manually enter values into my pump, but when I compared  values in the pump to all my meters, I wasn't even getting half of them. I knew I would not keep up with a manual log and had tried a couple of other diabetes trackers but found them cumbersome.",
2922,5,2014-06-21T23:00:56.000Z,elissafro,HIGHLY Recommend THIS APP!,"This app is the best app on my phone. Considering the circumstances it's also the most used app. I haven't found a more well rounded, fully integrated, user friendly app for tracking blood glucose levels than the MySugr app. I have my Mom, Dad, Sister, and two Aunts now using it, and my favorite thing about it is that they are keeping better track of their numbers and living healthier lives because this app makes it easy for them to do so. My fav feature is the timer, but I really would like to see it extended out to 6 hours. I am on a 4 hour testing/insulin schedule and usually set it for 3 hours and then reset it for 1 hour. So I'd really like to see more time on the timer. Also...with the mood icons, I'd like you to add one for nausea and/or vomiting. Nausea/vomiting can have a significant impact on blood glucose levels. Other than that, the app is great. Keep up the good work, and I can't wait to see what you have to make the app bigger and better down the road!",
2923,5,2014-09-30T05:50:31.000Z,Kona Biker,By far the Best!!!,I've tried everything and all have been quite inadequate in their functionality and display. From buggy software to confusing readouts that separate one single time entry into 3 separate lines making unneeded clutter mySugr solves all with grace & fun! It even was the 1st app to make me stop using my own created app with Numbers. A lot of time went into this and I find myself just looking through all the features & info because it's fun doing so with this motivational reward based app emulating the fitness apps with points and reward notifications. No matter how we get we never outgrow the desire to receive a 'Gold Star' like accolade. I find myself subconsciously trying harder and thinking through my choices throughout the day. The only gripe: I wish I could at least reorder my logbook tabs without having to pay the extra $20 since that's the only added feature I want. Great work mates!,
2924,5,2014-12-07T10:48:46.000Z,Sascha Endlicher,Amazing app!,"I installed MySugr the day I was diagnosed with diabetes. I started with a blood sugar level of 280 mg/dL in the morning and 350 mg/dL one hour after a meal. After a constant monitoring and logging with this app, walking 5 km per day outside (I use the Health app to keep track for now) and a reorganization of my eating habits, I am down to 89 mg/dL in the morning and 133 mg/dL one hour after a meal, 8 days after the initial diagnosis. I am giving this app a 5 star rating, although I am missing a few features. I hope they will be integrated in the future: I would love to have a more extended integration with the Health app, as there is valuable data in there (i.e. how many steps I walked and when I walked). I would also love to see integrations with third party apps. For example, I use MyPlate to keep track of my food and fluid intake and it syncs carbs, fat, etc with the Health app. It would be great if MySugr would a) sync those nutritional values from the Health app and b) import what I ate from the MyPlate app as a comment into MySugr and c) import my burnt carbs, so that I could show this data to my diabetologist in the report. There is now a lot of data out there and I hope MySugr will make the best out of it. Just seeing what you do and how it affects you can have a very positive impact on your life style. This could be useful and helpful for so many people!",
2925,5,2015-09-25T15:58:55.000Z,Summerin3D,Life Changer for a new Diabetic,"I was recently diagnosed with T2 diabetes and I wanted to be proactive in my treatment. After doing a lot of homework and trying out really clunky and frankly boring apps, I found mySugr. I cannot say enough about it. It has changed my life. It’s easy to use and fun. My whole family smiles when they hear the Diabetes Monster laughing or squealing. I show their intro video on their website to so many of my family and diabetic friends. Why does diabetes have to be so boring and like an awful curse? This app helps me stay on track and the monster helps me motivated. I would love to see them add a carb dictionary/encyclopedia to the app because as someone who is new to this it’s hard to know or remember how much things count for. That would be tremendously helpful. Also, perhaps some more food category choices under the food boxes and also under the action items at the bottom (lunch, dinner, work, etc). Some of those are a bit random and there are other more obvious ones that could be included. Overall, I love this app and the mySugr Suite. Thank you for having a different outlook on this disease. It’s not a death sentence and therefore we can have fun with it.",
2926,4,2015-12-12T07:35:36.000Z,DharmaScientist,Not bad... Getting better!,"I have been using this app for a few years and I'm a premium user. It's pretty great but I wish it would sync better with other apps. If I enter my glucose in another it doesn't end up on here but if I enter it here, the other app always picks it up. I also really need an Apple Watch app/complication. I'm having to use diabetes kit also because it shows an estimate of insulin on board and your last check. Pretty awesome. If this app had that it would be hands down the best app available. I really wish there was an Apple Watch but I still can't let this app go because it's been there for a long time and is pretty good.",
2927,5,2016-03-21T05:27:24.000Z,Ted Ninja,Worth the yearly sub!,"I've used a few different diabetes apps, some far better than others. Those don't hold half a burned out candle to this one. I've had horrible control over my diabetes through the years, and none of the apps have engaged me enough, or motivated me to keep up with it. I know for some this might not help you keep up with the logs but somehow this app has what I need. The challenges certainly help engage me, and I'm motivated to keep up with it since I put up money for it. But the added features I pay for are worth it as well, I can email my doctor my logs easily and they can get back to me on a regular basis. This has helped me curb my high blood sugar levels.",

This app has made it fun and gives me an actual motivation to log my sugars regularly! As I recently made the switch from pumping to injections, the user-friendly design and charting has allowed us to see trends in my sugar and adjust accordingly. Plus, I love the challenges and they help me stay motivation and strive for an even better level of self care. And who wouldn't love the 'scary' diabetes monster- my toddler loves him, and likes to help me input my sugars and see what the monster does! It's been a great tool to introduce him to diabetes and he thinks mommy's medicine time is fun!! Thank you for such a creative, user-friendly, and fun app. Definitely makes my daily care a lot more enjoyable!!",
2931,5,2013-08-06T12:32:12.000Z,Marshmellow03,Best app ever!,"I have tried various diabetes related apps, but this is the first one I haven't deleted, and which I really enjoy using! I'm a type 1 diabetic on multiple daily injections and this app is such a great way for me to track trends and have some fun while trying to control this crazy and unpredictable disease. Yes I said fun! The little interactive diabetes monster always makes me laugh or smile, if my blood sugar results aren't up to standards. The challenges provided are also a really fun and helpful tool!",
2932,4,2014-11-25T20:04:11.000Z,Kamalalynne,New to App,"I recently started using the app. It's only 2.5 weeks and so far I like it . It is easy to use and informative! I like having an easy and fun way to track my BGL's. I wouldn't  track on paper and I find I'm more committed to tracking now because of the app. I like the visuals and the graphs .. Of course ""ramming the monster"" lol. The only thing I would like added at this point would be to divide the sections into before meals and after meals and snacks.. Just for more clarity and for those of us who need to test more often. I never printed out a report yet.. Looking forward to that for the insurance company and Doctors office as well. I'll save that for my next review. I have the new iPhone 6 plus and have not had any crashes, or bugs as of today. I recommend this app for anyone who is looking to learn how to control their diabetes and track BGL.",

2934,5,2015-06-28T05:17:27.000Z,Poetthing,Life changing technology,"I have had type 1 diabetes for 34 years. I have always struggled with record keeping and with controlling my diabetes monster. This tool is so easy to use and is clearly designed by people who GET IT. I have used all the diabetes apps and this one is the only one that has worked well enough to keep using. It's about time that we had this technology and the attitude and mindset behind its design. Since I started using MySugr and consistently and honestly tracking all of the factors involved in managing the monster my HbA1C is lower than it has ever been and I feel better and more positive about my ability to control that number and I am able to be realistic about the data without beating myself up about specific numbers. To all the My Sugr staff, you rock! You are changing the world! Thank you!",
2935,5,2016-03-11T18:48:39.000Z,jbuniverse,Life Changing App,"This app has been life changing for me and my quest to better control my type 1 diabetes. First off it has a really nice, easy to use interface that's attractive on my iPhone 6 plus and also pleasing to the eye. It's very easy to input and keep track of important data, and the points scale makes it fun and rewarding even for this guy in his 30s to keep tabs on his blood sugars and diet. I have even started counting my own carbs and using them to better control my numbers daily! The feedback from this group has been great and they are very involved in emails and on social media. If you need help or have a question just ask and they get back to you in great time! Thanks for the support and I hope to continue making strides in my health with the use of this great app!",
2936,5,2017-02-20T15:01:12.000Z,TCinWV,Good app. Kind of fun.,"Let's face it. There's nothing ""fun"" about diabetes or about stabbing yourself multiple times per day. However this app is ""kinda"" fun! I'm only using the free version.  It provides enough of what I need.  But if I stick with it then eventually I'll probably upgrade to the paid version.  Another reviewer posted that it's $20 per month.  That is incorrect.  I'm pretty sure it's $2.99/month or a yearly subscription for less than $30. I think it's $27 or $28.  Getting the paid version opens up more challenges, which might motivate me to do more good things like .... exercise.  Upgraded version also offers more export options for the info you're tracking. But for now the export offered with the free version works for me.  It's not real clean but it works. I applaud he developers for trying to make this fun.",

I owe it to this app******Diagnosed in 2000 with type 2 diabetes.  I didn't take it seriously until I was put on insulin 2 years ago.  Now I am on 3 insulin medicines and have muscle loss and eye issues and my A1c was at 12.6.  I wasn't taking my medicine correctly mainly because I couldn't SEE the affects.  With the MYSUGR app I can set up reminders on a busy day, I can see how much the insulin is working and how certain foods make my sugars rise.  I will be getting my A1c done by the lab and it will be interesting to see if it is close to my estimated A1c on the app.  This has also made me aware of how many carbs I have been taking in.  I pay monthly and it is such a small price for what I'm gaining in health benefits and knowledge!",
2939,5,2017-07-12T04:51:21.000Z,Pappa Lover 64,Finally the perfect BS AND BP app!,"My blood pressure wasn't coming down even on meds and we discovered the  reason: I was diabetic. So I needed an app to track both BP and BS concurrently to watch for  correlations. So surprised to find how few apps do both! And before mySugr - none of them did it well! This is the perfect app for diabetics and especially those, like me, who need to track their BP as well. It's easy, all your entries can be made on one screen. And entry options not only include BP and BS but also meds, food, activity notes,etc. And the cute little rewards and cheers are actually fun and motivating- even for a 52 year old. After a month I was sold on this app and upgraded to premium. Well worth it! Very excited to now be able to set reminders and take food pictures to speed up my entries and guarantee I won't forget to take my meds and do my Glucose tests! Wish I could give mySugr MORE than 5 stars!",
2940,5,2014-06-24T01:56:34.000Z,Altermatt,MUST HAVE for parents!,"Our son was just diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, and we found this app about two or three weeks after diagnosis. We tried out a few other apps, but this is by far the best one we've found. We upgraded to the paid version, and any caretaker can input data on any device and it synchs without problem. While I'm at work I can see what his sugars are running and how much insulin he has needed. We use this with the mysugr jr app, and the data transfers between both. The little monster guy is cute, my son named it, and he can tickle it and make it talk. So there are features that parents love, and the kids enjoy. You can even pick a date range to create reports and e-mail or print for doctor visits.",
2941,5,2015-03-13T10:34:28.000Z,Parents of new diabetic,Amazing!!,My 2 year old son was newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. We had tried several other apps to log his blood sugars. One app we had a hard time syncing with and emailed for support and still to this day have gotten no response. We immediately looked for another app and stumbled upon this one. We love how eat it is and that we can each add info and the other can see it right away without having to sync it. We have even emailed with suggestions and got a thank you email within an hour! We love that there are reports that you can view and email to your doctor. It's such a simple and easy app too. I know once my son gets old enough he'll be able to enter in his own info once he's in school. Definitely worth the full purchase of the app!!,
2942,5,2015-05-30T16:30:45.000Z,Cyclonaut,Best diabetes tracking app BY FAR!!!,"My wife and I use this app to track our seven-year-old's  numbers so it is critical that the app stays synced between our phones to accurately keep him in range. We've NEVER had a problem with logbook not syncing (unlike other free apps). We switched to this app about a year ago and instantly loved it. The new update is even better, well worth the cost of the pro version.",
2943,5,2015-05-30T20:37:50.000Z,zombiecatt,The updates keep getting better.,"I have always loved the application since I started using it last summer (2014), and every time there's an update, it keeps getting better. This last update was the best because it added more variables that I can keep track of as to why I might have low or high blood sugar, such as allergies! for the past few months I've been saying I feel sick instead of allergies which can be confusing already. I really like the correction insulin feature too so I can distinguish between my food and correction amount.",
2944,5,2015-06-26T01:10:58.000Z,HydePryde,Best app I've found for diabetes management,"I have gestational diabetes, and I've tried several different apps. I particularly like MySugr Logbook because it allows me to track with photos as well as food types and descriptions, it lets me easily export my data for my doctor to view, and I can set up reminders (in the paid version) to check my post prandial blood sugar. There are challenges built in that keep me motivated to track everything, and that data has helped me determine how to control my sugar through my diet.",
2945,5,2015-08-05T14:57:48.000Z,Kathy4Paz,Best app for my diabetes control,"I seldom write reviews but I am so impressed with this app that I feel compelled to. I've tried pretty much all the apps for diabetes and I always come back to this one. It's easy to use and making entries is hassle free. Thus, I tend to consistently record all the pertinent data. Because of the visuals (graphs, etc.) I find that I analyze my control and am able to make adjustments on a more consistent basis. Since starting to use this app, my control has improved considerably and I've dropped a full 3 points on my A1c. The development team is also continually tweaking it and making improvements. The diabetes monster is also a fun (albeit silly) component. I highly recommend this app!",
2946,4,2015-12-10T06:05:25.000Z,Duck crazed,Pros and cons,"I love this app because it's both interactive and informative. It's fun to keep the sugar monster at bay. I am more willing to log my carbs and such because of the little guy. And also, it gives me a good look as to how my actions affect blood sugar.",
2947,5,2016-09-20T14:17:27.000Z,Ouryear02,Best App for Diabetics!,"Without question this is the best diabetic app on the market. I have managed to lower my A1C as a result of it. I am careful to track all my food and blood sugars, and this app makes it very easy to see trends. I've been able to adjust my basal rates on my pump to fine tune my numbers. I purchased the ""pro"" version after one day!",
2948,5,2017-01-04T05:00:28.000Z,Baby-betic,The Only Diabetic app you need!!,"I downloaded this app the day I was diagnosed and have kept track of my blood glucose (BG), carbs, exercise, and so much more ever since.  This app provides a team that are here for you if you have any questions. I love how it graphs your BGs and does all the statistics for you.  I have used this to print PDFs for my endocrinologist and dietitian to look at my progress. You can set alarms to remind you to check your BG.  It also has optional daily, weekly, and monthly challenges to motivate you to exercise more and live more healthy.  This company also has other apps that can help educate you in diabetes through videos and fun quizzes.  I highly recommend this app to the newly diagnosed, parents, friends, and loved ones!!",
2949,5,2017-03-03T01:39:59.000Z,le-cerk,You can't improve what isn't tracked,"This is the most simple and thorough logbook I've used, it is integrated with HealthKit, it can be synchronized with CGM data. Sign up for the weekly emails because even if you fall off the boat, you're reminded every Sunday that you're not keeping up with your logs, you're congratulated if you are. It's everything you need in a diabetes app. I tried the paid coaching($20/mo promo), but I am already lucky enough to have some of the world's best cars with my diabetes team. This was redundant for me, but if I had lesser care and lived in an area without research hospitals around, it would be a godsend. The pro version of the app can be unlocked by simply using the app with a challenge, so it's totally worth it to use the app. I cannot recommend this enough.",
2950,5,2014-10-10T14:01:13.000Z,Tara Neff,Can't Live Without It.,"As parents of a tween type 1 diabetic we constantly walk the tightrope between allowing our child to make choices and take responsibility for her care and making sure that she is doing so in the best way possible. This app is well worth the pro price. It is the only way that we have been able to successfully allow our young daughter to track her bg and allows us to monitor everything without feeling like we are hovering. The downloadable logs are incomparable in their ease for taking to the dr. And we were able to get her log without the fight or ""forgetfulness"" the paper logs used to inspire. This app is our family's ""can't live without"".",

On top of that you can access logs on their website from a pc and print out amazingly formatted log sheets for your doctor. Now if only it could link with my meter.",
2952,4,2015-04-08T02:18:57.000Z,OuztsBoots,"Clean, stylish, but lacking","This app makes keeping track of blood glucose levels super easy and fun. Most competitors look really cheap, while this app looks like it's had some care put into it. I think this is more focused for folks with type 2 diabetes, but it obviously still works fine for type 1. Even the print outs of the logs look really neat and professional. The main thing I wish was present was the ability to make a print out for different averages during the day. For example I wish it could give you averages for the last month of ""before breakfast"" and ""after breakfast"". I find myself having to go manually do the math for my doctor for things like that. This would be 5 out of 5 if they would just add that in.",
2953,5,2015-07-27T04:13:40.000Z,Sarah Catharina,Worth the extra $$,"This is by far is the most user-friendly and attractive Diabetes app I've ever used. I'm T2 and insulin dependent, and paying the few extra dollars a month makes it so much easier to track all my numbers. I love how they added bi-weekly and monthly reviews with the new update, which helps me to get an idea of my average numbers without blood tests at the doctor.  I'm more than willing to pay extra for an app so that the developers can continue to improve an already great product!",
2954,5,2015-08-13T18:05:49.000Z,Julieg's moosic!!,Great app,I downloaded the app kind of suspicious that I would have to buy stuff. But that's not the case! It is great for keeping up on my diabetes. Yeah you do have to add the stuff in but you can print off what you've done and take it to your doctor. I appreciate that. I do wish we could earn stuff with good blood sugar with like movie tickets or gift cards to get things other than food. That would be awesome!,
2955,5,2016-09-07T20:24:56.000Z,AllieB94,Great detailed app that syncs with Apple Health,"I'm not a diabetic but I like to be in tune to my body and how it's feeling. I think that my blood sugar really strongly plays a role in how I feel, so I like to check my sugar both regularly and when I'm feeling some sort of way. This app is great for that because you can add so many details and see how they related to different glucose levels. It's really helped me feel better because I can identify what makes my body feel bad and stop it so I can feel more comfortable and be healthy. I have a strong genetic history of diabetes in my family so it's also nice to monitor myself and know that my body is running normally. I also love that it syncs with Apple Health",
2956,5,2016-09-23T09:32:31.000Z,Katie Spahn,Great app. Simple but many features,"You can use as much or as little of the app as you want. The main screen is a dashboard that shows a graph of blood sugars that is color coded. You can quickly look at trends. Another nice feature is that you can disable the sound. GPS is a great idea but it needs work- I didn't see a way to add landmarks, and it would be nice to have that ability since some landmarks are preloaded. It would be neat if there were a corresponding desktop app where you could upload directly from the meter over USB. Mysugr might have something that covers this already but I didn't see it in this app- if it's there I missed it. Great app though!",

The built in features, such as the approx HbA1c, is incredible. It's a motivator for me personally,to keep pushing through the little challenges each day. Now I see those little challenges, not challenges at all. Before using this friendly / encouraging App, those little challenges would cause me to throw the towel in so to speak. I'm honest with my notes and aim to be as accurate as I can be,calculating my carbs / insulin / exercise, and working with my incredible Dr. We are aiming to bring my bsls down to basically a non diabetic bsl and keeping in mind my safety first. My results in a week are incredible. Awesome/ brilliant/ motivator in disguise!!!!",

I've been a type one for 22 years and i have never been good about taking care of myself - this app has helped me make so many positive changes in regards to my diabetes and eating habits! I  can't say enough good things about it.... the challenges are a fun way to get you to do what needs to be done and the point system makes you feel rewarded for tracking your sugars. I would recommend this app to any diabetic out there, after using it for a couple weeks it was a no brainer to pay for the pro version!!!! It's WELL worth the money! I love this app!!!",

Graphics are fun and there are many automatic features picked up out of my other installed apps.  I highly recommend it and wish I had signed up a year ago!",
2960,4,2013-11-26T03:34:17.000Z,Mom of TD1 son,record keeping fun ?!,"This app has made it so easy for my husband and I to record and analyze our sons trends. Love the instant analysis telling me average BS in 1, 7, 14 and monthly averages as well as how easy it is to produce and print data for the doctors. My boys (and I) always get a kick out of tickling the diabetes monster. It just makes us smile and laugh - who doesn't need that. I'd recommend it to anyone. My only suggestion for improvement would be to add a food bank and scanner option like my fitness app (and other food apps) use. I get a little tired of always having to repeatedly type in the foods he eats.  A bank of recently eaten foods would help a lot. Even so, this app is the best out there!",

I am 26 years old and use this app almost 10x/day because it helps track everything. The reports are awesome and I can look back and find out why I got low or hi at any time. My A1C used to be 10.5 consistently and after my first 3 months with this awesome tracking tool I finally got my diabetes under control and my most recent A1C was 7.6! This app is fun and easy to use and I've recommended it to all my T1 friends :) please keep it up this app has helped me turn my LIFE around!!! I am so thankful I found this after trying out several others. :),
2962,5,2015-03-13T21:03:00.000Z,CarolinaDingo,Great app,We have been using this app since our daughter was diagnosed with T1D Thanksgiving of 2013. It is an invaluable tool that has made our adventure into the diabetes world bearable. The ability to keep all care takers (my daughter is 3) in sync makes keeping track of her diabetes a breeze. Our endocrinologist is always impressed with the robust reports we provide them because it allows them to spot trends in her BG that may have otherwise gone over looked. This app doesn't just log your diabetes info. It has become a necessary component to controlling our daughters diabetes! Special thanks to the devs for helping make our lives easier!,
2963,3,2015-06-07T19:18:43.000Z,Megan315,Bring back the analysis feature,"I really loved this app until the latest update and now I think it's just okay. I think it's more difficult to enter information now since it's more spread out and there's more scrolling, and I HATE that the analysis feature is no longer available. I used my a1c to determine how close I was to the analysis and was pleasantly surprised by the results. It was incredibly motivating to see what my 7 day, 14 day and monthly averages were and I wish it was still available. I do like the fact that food and correction bolus are now separate, but since my carb ratio is 1:10 it's always pretty easy for me to see how much is going to food. Overall I do like this app, I just liked it a lot better prior to the latest update.",

It has everything we need to log and every details the doctors said to record is included in this app and even more. Sharing the subscription between me and other devices even the web interface made adding and follow up easier. The option of setting a reminder very helpful within the daily stress in the beginning. Having meals, snakes and correction flags helped in adjusting the doses.",

MySugr is the app I finally settled on because it allows me to track not just my BG but it provides a lot of options about my mood, before/after meals, bedtime, etc. this feature is unique to MySugr as far as I can tell! It's also fun because I want to beat the Monster each day and earn those points by tracking BG, taking pictures of my food, and entering other information such as medications and/or insulin. I like this app a lot because it allows me to keep tabs on my disease and have fun while doing so.",
2966,5,2016-10-20T02:53:31.000Z,Momma T100,Love the concept,I love the concept of how this is program is pretty easy to use. Has taken me about 30 days to use this app to learn how to customize the tiles. Love it even more now! The reports that print out are really easy to read and the estimated A1c gives you encouragement to continue to tame the glucose monster. My Dr. Really likes the graphs and print outs as I am able to send to his email just prior to my appointment and he has time to analyze the numbers to make adjustments in the regimen he needs to for tighter control. My only wish is that the app had a place to record meals as well for a full picture. Have to use a separate app for that.,

I'm a teenager that's constantly on the move and always rushing from one place to another, frequently forgetting to monitor my sugars. This app has motivated me to keep checking, because it's so easy and has shown such a visible change in my numbers. It doesn't hurt that you earn points for logging in detail and have a little cartoon mocking you all the time. It makes a not so fun disease a little brighter each day!! My a1c now goes anywhere between 6.9-7.1 the lowest it's ever been!! Thankful for this app.",

When I happened to see this app last week, I gave it a try and immediately loved it. Within 24 hours, my husband and son were also using the app on their devices. We have now upgraded to pro. I love the reports and analysis for spotting and fixing negative trends. I also really enjoy adding pictures of his meals and seeing those as I scroll through his log. My son enjoys the challenges. Absolutely, highly recommend this app!",
2983,3,2015-07-17T05:20:11.000Z,Loveloverlove,Not as good as it used to be.,"Being a young T1D my mom and I used this app to communicate about diabetes before the Dexcom Share came out. Now after taking a break from MySugr for quite awhile while we used Share, I decided to give this a try for when I check myself at nighttime. I was very disappointed to see that all of the things I used to be able to use like marking if I had a headache or if I was sick etc. we're all things I had to purchase now. My family already pays a lot for diabetes care and now it's another bill we could have to pay. I just miss the old app and I understand that MySugr needs the money to create more apps, but all this charging is quite excessive!",
2984,5,2015-11-12T14:36:01.000Z,A happy diabetic,So encouraging,"I used to be very complacent about managing my diabetes, until one day I went to the doctor and my HgA1c was very high. I started using this app and in just a month, it went down 2 points! This app is incredibly encouraging and interactive, it really keeps you motivated to keep logging. For me, just keeping better track of my numbers got me to take care of myself better. I had tried other logbook apps before, but felt that they were lacking in some way. This one is so thorough; it even takes my pump settings into account. I absolutely love mySugr!",
2985,4,2016-02-16T23:38:08.000Z,Chevy_girl_03072005,Helpful,"I find this app really helpful in it encouraging me to test my sugars as much as I really should. The biggest downfall I have is that as an insulin pump user, I wish there was a way to put in a negative insulin correction rate or a spot for insulin on board. It does tend to get a little confusing when putting in a carb/food insulin number and having to subtract for a lower than average sugar or when there is still active insulin in my system. This is important so that when I send the results to my doctor, she knows that I'm not using to much insulin due to the activity of it. Other than that, I don't have any complaints",
2986,5,2016-04-13T04:30:50.000Z,Criswh,Awesome and simple,"I've been type 1 diabetic for a few years now, and I have a pretty good idea of how different foods affect my blood sugar. My main objective was to just keep track of the blood sugar itself, I don't really have an interest in tracking the carb amount since it is all pretty much the same. I feel like other apps pretty much force you to track all that extra info as well. This app gives you more freedom by letting you be as detailed as you'd like, not to mention it is great with keeping you motivated to keep your numbers within the healthy range.",
2987,3,2016-09-15T17:35:37.000Z,Dannilim,Gestational Diabetes,I have Gestational Diabetes and wanted an app to track stuff. The free version is useless. There is no food data base (which a lot of other apps have for free or for a small fee). This app charges $2.99 a month. Forget it.,
2988,4,2017-01-10T15:51:51.000Z,diggerdan1974,Great start - needs a few more features,"The app is very easy to use. Looking forward to seeing a few specific features: auto complete for food and medicine logging; integrated carb, calorie, and food data based on inputs, better/more accurate mapping function (for some reason I'm continually at a restaurant down the street), more standardized feelings and food types, additional medicine/pill logging selections (e.g.: Trulicity, simvastatins) with pill weight included in set up instead of on input screen.",
2989,5,2017-09-17T11:45:50.000Z,Jhromiko,Going Pro,"As a diabetic of over 8 years I really love this app. I was shocked and surprised when I saw all the functionality and options, like how it knew every glucose monitor and pump I've ever used. Most apps for diabetes management I'd seen before didn't know the difference between type 1 and 2, didn't even touch gestational, or were horribly outdated.",

I also love that i can print out my reports and give it to my Dr. to review and compare with my pump reports. I just went to my Dr.s and she loved how I could look up every test and tell her exactly what I ate, amount of carbs, and my insulin rate! She took down the info and said she would share this with others!!!! Thanks for a great app! The only way I could imagine this being better would be if it could look up food counts! :)",
2991,4,2014-03-10T17:45:44.000Z,Gracefulstreams,Awesome App!,Really easy to use! I love the alarm feature because it's difficult for me to remember to check my blood sugar 2 hours after meals. I also like being able to take a picture of my meal within the app because My doctor/dietician can see my portion sizes. I can also go back and add information later if I need too. A few things I would like added are: 1. The ability to add my weight. 2. A place to add water/drink in ounces. 3. More or unlimited note taking space. This is by far the best app I have found for helping me manage my diabetes. Great work! I am looking forward to future updates.,

Some of the apps out there are not user friendly, ugly or the developer has stopped supporting it (even though its still for sale). You can do all your tracking with the free version, though the nice pdf reports come with the pro version. The challenges and ability to ""defeat"" your diabetes monster on a daily basis is a nice incentive to track things as well.",

It so well organized and gives you both a quick and detailed idea of how you are doing with your numbers. Having such a well functioning app has encouraged me to keep track of my numbers and what I eat (on top of so many other things this app offers). I also notice you can print out your logbook and records which will be super handy when I visit my endocrinologist next!,

I downloaded this app when it first came years ago and I was able to use all of the features like taking photos of your meal but I guess since it has become more popular I can't do that anymore unless I upgrade. People with diabetes already pay enough for medical supplies, wish we got let off the hook for once!",

Armed with a glucometer and the internet I was fortunate to find this app! The app helped me get started treating my diabetes with confidence (well at least with records to help me later). It's easy to use. The free version has served as the Best one place to input data. I used it to input my blood sugar levels, number of carbs I am eating, foods, meal descriptions, tracking medications. Which for me helps a ton.",

This app is fantastic. It's friendly and you get great email and in app support from fellow diabetics. It's super easy to keep a log this way and it sends you a weekly report summarizing everything. That's all with the free version!!! The developers have a good sense of humor which really helps cope with this especially when you first get started. Very user friendly. Get it!!  You won't be disappointed,

This is usually the most intuitive and comprehensive and fun app I came across and strongly recommend it. The only thing that would make it even better would be an integration of something like CalorieKing so that you can manage even more closely",

It allows you to track not only your blood sugar but also carbs, long and short acting insulin, exercise, emotions and best of all, it shows the trends and averages of your blood sugar levels. This app not only helps you keep your sugar in check, but can also help you understand how different foods affect it. I absolutely love it! By far the best $20 bucks I've spent at the App Store!

With my printed out levels color coded and notes I was referred to as the ""dream patient"". This app has allowed me to educate my children as well in a fun way to get them to eat better. My daughter (just turned 2) reminds me to check my sugar monster. Thank you for all the work you are doing!",

The program lets user customize what data fields are wanted...blood glucose, food, exercise, carbs, etc. Reports are generated for the user...no tedious paper and pencil, calculators, etc. Screen data fields are in different colors for troublesome or target zones.  Simple to use and to understand....Best of all--the ""Monster"" giggles or makes other appropriate sounds when data is entered.  Brings a smile to the face...even your own giggle.",

All the tracking and poking and rearranging my life around my eating schedule has been hard. This app not only gives me a single location to keep all my tracking notes, it gives me a little smile as my sugar monster giggles and ""noms"" in response to every entry. It's amazing what that little bit of positive feedback does to brighten my day. And my nutritionist was very happy to have so much information at her fingertips when I handed in my two week report.",
3008,5,2016-09-19T04:48:58.000Z,Brodie 15,Very Helpful,"I've been using the app for about a week now. It came in very handy when I talked to my doctor and could just show her what my numbers had been. I love how it links with Apple Health. So everything records to keep track of everything I do. If there is a spike in my sugars, I'll be able to see what may have caused it and share with my doctor at future visits if she needs to know. I would recommend this app for anyone dealing with diabetes. Whether newly diagnosed or have been diabetic for years.",

MySugr is an easy way to keep all my info in one place. I also enjoyed the weekly report I received via email. Of note, I was a bit frazzled when I couldn't see my A1C estimate before realizing you have to input 21 readings in a week before the estimation is given. I typically test twice a day, so this may not be a feature I use, but I am satisfied with the ease of use and will continue to use the app.",

The released version is even better than the version I tested. Plain and simple, my numbers improved because the app encouraged me to pay closer attention to managing my diabetes. The reports are very good and the usability/interface of the app is what you would expect from brand new software. I am very pleased and excited about this app. I'm a type 1 diabetic 25 years and counting.",

Ugh. The report tab would freeze the app; i got very flustered. The support team members were prompt in returning my emails, very helpful and kind! Besides these tag issues, this app is WONDERFUL! It helps you manage your condition; turns diabetes difficulty into endocrinology ease! Just fix the tag issue :) 4 stars ****",

I can see good results as well ;) This app makes logging the information very easy and then makes that information available in a straight forward concise manner. Awesome!",

Plus all my pics were deleted that I had used before. What the heck!

I know I'm not the only diabetic who has spikes from coffee. I was hoping the app would give me a better sense of coffee effects' timeline and intensity, but I have to relegate ""coffee"" to notes or chalk it up as a ""supplement""/diet soda (but diet soda doesn't spike me...). It would also be great if there were autofill options for recent/typical user foods. Otherwise, it's a fab app--I highly recommend this to any diabetic trying to make logging really easy and trackable.",

I had a recent appointment with my endocrinologist and was able to show her my readings and she was impressed with it as well. The only problem I have is that I can't log my exercise because it is not user friendly with my misfit shine which logs my walking daily. I normally don't write reviews but I love this App and check my glucose readings several times daily.",

Unfortunately MySugr logs a time of 11:59pm for every entry coming from LoseIt requiring an edit on all entries. I would highly recommend to anyone. Not a fan of requiring a subscription - would rather have a flat fee.",

I would give it a 5 star except they don't allow type 2 oral meds and other meds, only insulin. If they would add features for type 2 diabetics also, hands down this would be the greatest app. I would love to see them add type 2 meds as well as any other meds that a person may take, blood pressure readings, lab results such as A1C, cholesterol, lipids, etc. This way you have a record of medical history as well, in case of an emergency.",

It gives you an average blood sugar so you can kind of get an idea of what your a1c is going to be. I love that I don't have to carry around a log book and that I can log what I've eaten with the app as well-- the basic version doesn't give calories (don't know if the pro version does either) but being able to put all my info in one app is seriously time saving.,

The 3rd time, we decided to add both a medication and testing.  This app was chosen so I could dump data in Apple Health which allowed me to email weekly results.  I can still put the data in Apple Health, but reports now cost, as do all the other previously free features.  It is decent at its purpose, but if there were something else that accepted Apple Health data that I already use, I don't think I would use this.",

The monster does help make logging things in a little less tedious as well as giving you something to smile at. It definitely is more specifically a diabetic app then a Health app, so if you're looking for something that tracks all of your nutrition values of foods or will look them up for you, this is not it.

Something my old notebooks couldn't do. I also like that it changes color depending on my readings. Makes it easier to see when my diabetes isn't doing so good.  In 15 years of pricking my finger & keeping food journals this is one of the best I've come across. If I had more diabetic friends I'd recommend this to them. Thumbs way up 👍👍,

It's hard to forget to check your sugar and track your eating when there is this much excitement involved.

This would be especially great for young teens and even children, but even at age 23 I find myself sucked into it. Such a wonderful idea!",

I encourage anyone with type 1 diabetes to get this app. I even told my doctor about it and she thought it was very useful and interesting. The only thing is I wish that there were more tags available for the free version, considering that most of them are for pro only. Overall though, very helpful app!",
3036,5,2016-05-20T22:23:53.000Z,Tc527,Literal life saver,"This app is the best I've found for diabetes. I've had it for a while but decided I wanted better control after my eating habits changed. I'm type 1 and it lets me add notes about what I've had to eat, blood sugars and injection amounts. The biggest benefit for me is that I'm living abroad in Ireland where they use a different scale than in the states and the app can automatically switch it so I can show my doctor results in the format used in Europe. Love love love it!",
3037,5,2016-08-02T00:34:10.000Z,MarlaR27,"Easy, quick, fun","I've tried several different methods of tracking and this is the only one that I can maintain. It would be nice if the reports had more options for what info is included and how it is displayed (currently the meal descriptions are tiny, but that is something my drs want to see most), but the reports do have a clever display and only take a moment to figure out. It is definitely NOT a detrimental feature that should deter you from this amazing app!",
3038,5,2016-08-09T10:01:50.000Z,Mekimmielee,The Kid In Me!,I love this app. I love the reactions of the sugar monster and his noises. Even at 51 I need the extra incentives to take my sugars regularly. I am Type 2 but I have recently recommended this app to a friend whose 3 year old has been diagnosed.,
3039,5,2017-01-08T16:10:24.000Z,Winkerz2,Keeps tracking simple,I am a new to having type 2 diabetes. Tracking has been overwhelming.  MySugr has made it easy.  I snap a picture of what I eat and then can figure out my carbs later when I have a moment.  It makes me more aware of what I am eating.  I think it will be a big help in working with my doc. Since it was created by folks that also have diabetes they really have made something that works well.  Love the ease and thoroughness.,
3040,5,2013-08-05T22:49:16.000Z,airbear172,MySugr App,Incredible App that provides the motivation and the fun to test regularly. T2D for 10 years now and would always eyeball my state.  Rarely tested...maybe 4 times a year.  Came across the app and realized diabetes truly is a monster that needs to be tamed.  That coupled with A1C levels rising to Federal Aviation Authority max levels for me to maintain my pilots license and I was ready! Thanks to the developers of this app for providing a valuable and entertaining tool that is contributing so much to my well being!!',
3041,5,2013-12-30T14:32:43.000Z,FormerTechTeacher,Encouraging and coaxing,"Not a newcomer to databases, I can appreciate that this little gem works as well for me as it might for someone new to keeping data. It provides encouragement and subtle coaxing to help you remember to test and record your glucose levels. The reporting options are certainly handy: the glucometer reader in my doctor's office was broken last visit and we reviewed the numbers instead on my phone with this app. I consider mySugr a ""must-have"" for my diabetes management!",
3042,5,2014-05-19T00:09:53.000Z,djzapp,By far best glucose app out there!,I have used countless apps for tracking my blood sugar and this how you do it! My favorite feature is the reminder I can set after eating. That was my biggest problem was remembering to check 2 hours after. Now cherry on top would be they make a glucose machine that connects Bluetooth and integrated with the app!,
3043,5,2014-10-23T12:35:36.000Z,VTHokie76,Love it!!,Makes doing what isn't so much fun a bit better. Can't wait to earn the pro edition to unlock some more features. My 8 yr old daughter has named her 'monster' and thinks all of his expressions and sounds are fun!  Makes tracking blood sugar easy!  My one recommendation would be to add in a carb counting feature that allows you to look up carb values for different foods - haven't found a good app for that yet and it would be nice to have an all-in-one app!,

The app helps me keep track of the patterns I have through the day and weeks to see what has caused my sugars to spike or crash. I love that I've been able to tame my little monster named ""acceptance"" everyday since I got the app. The app has also allowed me to see the symbolism of how I can be in control by taming my diabetes (or monster) that is always with me! It's wonderful!",
3045,4,2016-07-28T17:11:29.000Z,Jorge Tz,Something new for me -- makes it easier,"I have not used a glucose log in the phone, so my review really is not comparing it to others. But I like it a lot so far. It makes me more diligent than the previous method where l used notebooks and never really kept up.  The animation is great for kids, maybe an option to turn it off would be good (not really a deal breaker, more a recommendation). It is easy to use, does its job, and so far it has not broken anything down, it or other processes.",
3046,5,2016-10-28T18:11:16.000Z,GeorgeOJ,Great app and a few requests,"This is a very good app. I have two requests. One, it would be great if it could record and average separately baseline (fasting) and postprandial numbers. I often want to know how high my number got after a meal, and this data messes up my pretty good baseline averages.",
3047,5,2016-11-12T07:35:49.000Z,Davetydavedave,Kinda fun,"Easy input and cheerful design. I was a little bummed that I got the Accu check meter that I thought was compatible and would get a free to ugrade but it was not approved in USA yet. The iHealth Gluco is the meter you want for USA. I decided to just pay the upgrade and do manual input. It's expensive but I'm happy with the app after a few weeks use. I wish it could interface with one of the carb counting apps.. And maybe exercise tracker one day too. Simple to use, good for youth or adult.",
3048,5,2016-12-10T20:34:40.000Z,burnetteprncss,Love It!,"I've been a long time Type 2 diabetic, but recently added insulin therapy. I was using a combination of other apps to track blood sugar readings, carb counts, blood pressure, and weight which has gotten tiresome especially when trying to export a cohesive report to give to my doctor. This app does wonders in tracking all of the above in one place and the PDF report export is a great feature. Definitely spring for the pro version upgrade.",
3049,5,2017-02-11T19:14:48.000Z,Ilda Cortez,Diabetics Life,It's not easy living a life with diabetes because we limit our selves to may delicious foods but with this app I was able to learn what to eat and what not to eat to keep my sugar levels in good range. It's easy and fun at the same time because you can monitor your progress and feel better with our self because you know you are making the right choices in life. I would recommend this app to those like me.,
3050,5,2013-06-06T02:26:34.000Z,Jedi Micah,Great but needs a change.,This app looks amazing and very fun but they desperately need an update to it. In the settings they need to make the ratio more sensitive than merely 1unit for every 20 carbs. My personal ratio is 1 units for every 25,
3051,5,2014-04-05T20:35:30.000Z,ItalianJew1972,Great for Teens and Kids!!,"Our teen is newly diagnosed type 1. This app has made logging glucose levels extremely easy! It's also eased much worry as we sent her to school the first few weeks of this diagnosis. As she would log her blood glucose while at school, my husband and I could monitor her levels, all while at different places during the day, since we are all logged on the same account. This app has given us piece of mind!",
3052,5,2014-11-22T14:13:37.000Z,Nltripp,Fun and motivational.,I was diagnosed with type 1 two years ago and have tried to use non-diabetes focused apps to help me keep on track but they just weren't easy enough. This app is great. The monster theme is cute and silly. The challenges are achievable and the day to day tracking is easy and to the point. I've noticed an improvement in my average blood sugar since using this app for the last month. I highly recommend it!,
3053,5,2014-11-25T19:47:06.000Z,Strawberry921,Love this fun and helpful app!,This app makes logging my son's diabetes info fun and easy. I love the colors and the sounds (sweet and non-obnoxious).  Creating a PDF log is super easy.,

Keeps your averages and let's you know informant information you need. Carb count, medications can be stored plus gives you fun challenges to work on. I used to have an issue using most apps or trying to keep track on paper, no longer will this be an issue. Thanks for the great app!",
3055,3,2015-07-17T19:29:54.000Z,OBXRebel,Good app for tracking Blood Sugar,"I like this app since it is fairly easy to use and syncs data with the Apple Health app. I'm not as happy with the current version. It is now more difficult to use. It used to be intuitive, but now you need to search for things and entering test results is not as easy. Also, when installed, the default does not the option for entering meds taken. You have to goo to set-up and add it.",

My doctor mentioned hearing about mysugr several weeks ago. I downloaded and started using the app and have been able to work with my doctor to adjust my diet and insulin to get the monster back under control. The interface is well organized and the animated monster makes logging fun.,

Starting to use this app has given me direct awareness and ultimately control over my numbers. Using mysugr is easy and comprehensive. I can easily produce reports for my Endo.,
3059,5,2016-05-07T14:03:38.000Z,macesesi,Works so far,"WHEN I use it, it helps keep me on track. The weakest part of it is my part! I've had it for a few years and the data as icons, game-like input, and comprehensive tracking keep me motivated to care for myself. Any data fields you're missing can be placed in the notes. And they've already explained why they need 3 tests per day to give you an A1C. I'm just hoping for a version where my blood sugars cross over by bluetooth.",
3060,5,2013-10-05T21:02:50.000Z,Justanamber,Awesome app for diabetics,"My daughter is T1 diabetic. This app is amazing! Easy to use, keeps up with all of her doses, moods, and any notes I need to share with her doctor to look for patterns to help with management. She loves to input her moods and the challenges are fun. The app exports the info in a way that is easy for her doctor to read. I've tried other apps and this one is by far the best. I hope there is a version available for windows phones soon as well.",

K,Love this app!!!,"I am a teenage girl with T1 diabetes, and I have been struggling to motivate myself to check my blood glucose regularly, which was having a negative impact on my health. I was getting desperate, and so I decided to give this app a try, thinking ""hey, what's the harm""? I am so glad I did, because it's proven to be extremely helpful and motivating. It's helped me set goals for myself, and holds me accountable. If you are struggling with diabetes, and need a fun, motivating log book, this app is for you.",

You know a lot of time and thought by lots of talented people went into making this. Then the idea behind it is genius! Not only are you tracking your BG but this app makes it fun by motivating you to log your results by giving you points and rewards! I'd recommend this app to any diabetic!,

I love being able to lock up my monster and when you do that it's called taming it. I also love getting to see my A1 C and I also love getting to see how many carbs are in my average over the last day week month or 90 days. I definitely suggest this app for anyone with diabetes looking for a Logbook app!!,

The added A1c feature is a great help also just as a bonus. I do not remember how long I have been using this app but it has been a very long time and I have recommended it to everyone who I help in a diabetes support group that I am part of on the Internet for the last 2 years or so.,

Then, I'll update my review. Other than that, it's super user friendly allowing me to enter all necessary info on one page - even temp basal amounts for my 2 year old Type 1 diabetic daughter. Logging all her carbs, what she eats, bolus is so important because it helps me know where to adjust her I:C and why she dropped to low or spiked from what food and when. This app helps us manage her T1d along with her CGM and insulin pump.",HI! Thanks for your feedback and yes the logging out is super annoying. I am totally with you!

Exercise needs to be linked to apple health so your daily steps and running are automatically logged and integrated.  The meal section could be improved exponentially.  Restaurant menus need to be integrated.  Food options with pre loaded carbs should be integrated.  Must admit been helpful, but a 20$ app should be much more complete",

Again, thank you for putting in so much thought into this app. Oh, and I'm using My Fitness Pal with this for the carb counts.",
3095,5,2015-05-23T12:21:38.000Z,Nadja19,Brilliant Diabetes App,I looked around for several and tried a few before settling on this one. It has everything I would need to track and more. The user interface is incredibly accessible to anyone.,
3096,5,2015-10-06T03:50:07.000Z,Diabadass😘,Amazing!,"My endo is always getting on me to log my sugars, log my insulin intake. This app is so easy to use! You can add your sugars, the time, insulin info, and add comments if you had to decease insulin for any reason. It is specific for any type of diabetes. The only thing I wish it had, would be if it had a location where you can add your insulin to carb ratios, that could be in the pro version though.",
3097,5,2016-05-19T03:31:48.000Z,We don't need no stinking nickname,An app that works and fun to use too!,"I have several apps for helping me track my BG levels.  This one by far is the best by far. Having a silly monster make faces or sympathetic noises when levels go haywire, helps make having to deal with T1D that much better.",
3098,5,2016-05-24T18:24:10.000Z,Debi's ipad,User Friendly important tool!,"I've been using this app for only a week, but it's been very helpful. I like being able to take a picture of my meal and looking up the carbs later depending on where and when I have a meal. Visually it is colorful and playful. I've paid for the full year and investing I'm my health is very worth it! As I continue to log, I know the reports will be very helpful. Thank you My Sugr!",
3099,5,2016-09-04T01:40:06.000Z,Pete1952,Good app for tracking sugar levels!,"I found this app and just use it to track my sugar readings. It keeps them all in a handy place. I was wondering about the A1c calculation and was in the hospital and was having my blood checked 4 times a day. The A1c showed an estimated 7.1 and I get a call from a nurse that said my A1c was 7.8, in the ballpark.",
3100,5,2014-08-03T04:14:43.000Z,T1Dad,Best multi-device app out there!!!,"Tried them all, but couldn't find a quick app that tracked the key things we wanted for our T1D daughter. This is so easy and helpful we finally stopped logging on paper. The real power for us is it supports multiple devices, so when I'm at work I can see how she's doing for the day. And the staff . . . Simply Amazing. Kudos to Fredrik for making us feel so welcomed. Vielen Dank!",

I am 63 years old and I need to loose about 100  pounds I feel that I will be able to loose the weight thanks to this app.,
3102,5,2015-03-01T02:58:56.000Z,Nickiness,I LOVE this app!,"I've been looking for an app to log my sugars. Sure, I could upload them via my meter and pump but it's been proven that better control is achieved through actual documentation of one's blood glucose levels and being able to see patterns. I've tried other apps and while they work, they're not as fun as this one. I'm so glad I downloaded this. It helps me stay on track!",
3103,5,2015-09-30T04:34:41.000Z,T. Hersom,Inspirational for T1 Diabetic,"I was recently diagnosed with T1 diabetes as a 25 year old IT consultant who was obsessed with technology. As you other diabetics know, the technology out there, as well as the information, is appalling and shameful to the healthcare industry. The highest rated app for diabetics is s@&t but was our only resource until now. Thank you for providing an app that is easy and inspiring to someone who hates checking their sugars and had no app to motivate!",
3104,5,2016-08-08T20:51:47.000Z,Bhskybolt,Great app,"I Love this app, much easier than keeping a paper log and easier to see your trends.. I was over whelmed at first with all the possibilities with this app but you only have to use what you want to, but the more you put in it the more info you can track and see what your doing and how your body responds to different things!! I recommend this app for anyone with diabetes..",
3105,4,2016-11-14T14:09:32.000Z,RaiderMama,I'm a bad T1D about handwritten paper logging,"So mySugr is pretty ideal for me. I'm also a Dexcom G5 user and you can get your reading through the Apple Health app. mySugr will then use Apple Health as a source and add your result from your Dexcom, so that's nice, but still need to manually enter BS if not integrated with the one meter they off access (Really, guys?! Please add more meter brands. Really wish it had an integrated carb count database of foods, but certainly not a deal breaker. To me, worth a yearly fee because I loathe paper logs.",
3106,5,2017-01-01T19:32:18.000Z,PhillyDude01,Love it,"This is a nice little blood glucose monitor with some cute features. It's a fun and innovative way to track blood glucose. You can export logs to CSV, which is good enough for me because I only want to print for my doctor, not share electronically. You'll have to pony up $28 for the ability to export your history in PDF or Excel format.  I already have enough diabetes related expenses, so I'll stick with the default CSV format.",
3107,5,2017-03-20T12:38:02.000Z,K374758,Perfection! This app is amazing!,This app has helped me and my doctor so much in preparing to get on an insulin pump. I paid for the full year up front and it's the best app investment I've made. The only thing I would like to see is a way to look up carbs in common foods and restaurants stop I don't have to use two different apps.,
3108,5,2017-04-26T18:25:37.000Z,Goat Jones,Love the fun in this app,"I use this app for my 9 year old son.  He loves the noises the glucose monster makes....it brings joy into an otherwise difficult task.  Easy to use, love using it to track numbers, patterns, etc.  My husband and I have it synced up on our phones so we can look at the numbers instead of constantly asking each other what his number was.  Two thumbs up!",
3109,5,2017-09-02T13:31:14.000Z,ostiegh,Love it!,"This app has made my pregnant, type-one-diabetic, accounting heart happy. I have tried many things to keep track of my blood sugar/insulin doses, but they were all inconvenient or bulky and a pain. Now I can always have my log with me, and easily see trends to make adjustments to my doses, which is so important during pregnancy. Love the graph and the monster. I will use this even after I give birth!",
3110,5,2014-06-08T16:15:35.000Z,IceTT,Amazing!,"I searched (once again) for a blood sugar app after having a lot of them. I didn't understand the ""fun"" reviews on this one but I thought I would try it. This app is sooo much easier to use, it looks nice and the monster... Wow.. He's so cute and i look forward to his responses. It's like having my own personal cheerleader. I look forward to his cheers (and boos) with my progress updates. Good job! ✨🌟💫🌟✨",

Every app I tried was either way too complicated or didn't do what I needed it to do. mySugr Companion is by far the best app out there!  It's powerful and logs everything I want to track but is still easy and fun to use. My daughter loves it and so do I!!",
3112,5,2015-01-26T18:25:03.000Z,Starpunk7,Awesome diabetes app!!,"I've only used this app maybe a week or so, and it's already helped me a bunch getting me into a routine of sugar checking and taking insulin like I should be. It turns it into fun rather than a boring chore to manage diabetes. I am type 1 btw. I am considering getting Pro because the app has helped me so much. Thanks to the apps team I know this has helped me and I think it will help many more.",
3113,5,2015-05-30T20:39:13.000Z,M&T<3,Really enjoy this app,"This app has been so helpful. It has helped me get my type 1 diabetes under more control. It makes me want to check my blood sugars more, take my insulins and seizure medication. It's also helping me eat better feel better and feel in more control while still allowing me to feel like everyone else. Few glitches but they are improving :)",
3114,5,2015-07-04T17:34:57.000Z,Realgrrl,Excellent,Have been using this app for quite awhile now and really like it!  It's easy to use and my doctor likes how easy it is to read my sugar readings at my appointments - she can just quickly scroll down them know rather than fight through those old sugar reading books. I like the new app upgrade too where I can keep track of stuff more easily!,
3115,5,2016-02-05T02:08:20.000Z,CharlyBrong,Extremely clever!,"So, I love the professional and intelligently put together interface. The diabetes monster is a really nice motivational touch to what would have been an otherwise monotonous exercise, and my 7yr old daughter loves to hear the giggle. Those things are great and the app would have been deserving of high marks if that were all. But the fact is the app is really a tremendous help to diabetics. Six stars!",

And this app made it all easier to me. My exams are better, my average glucose is way better and I feel great.",
3118,3,2016-07-17T23:44:50.000Z,Telejoke,Main Feature Broken,"The app is advertised by both Aviva and MySugr as being able to import readings wirelessly. Only reason I downloaded it. Unfortunately, this app only recognizes one device. They've been saying support for Aviva is coming soon. I suspect issue is government related and not fault of Aviva or MySugr. Can't give higher rating without trying the features for which I got the products.",
3119,4,2016-09-15T11:39:47.000Z,Ila1941,Has improved,I tried this app a while back and didn't like it. I like it now. I don't really miss that you can't note whether a test is before or after a meal. After all when the A1C is run it doesn't make a difference then. The only negative I have is that even though it works with Myfitnesspal it does not pull all the data in that is available. It also does not take all the data from the IOS Health either.,
3120,5,2013-07-03T14:42:38.000Z,Lynne Swant,Absolutely love this app,"I have had diabetes over 22 years now and the one thing I have hated doing is logging everything.  It was never fun.  With this app, I have fun logging everything I do.  The diabetes monster makes me want to log.  It is so easy to use and have never forgotten to log because of it!  Try it out! You'll like it.  I agree with those who have already posted!",

I love that it graphs her BG readings. It's so easy that she can do it herself!  Since she's newly diagnosed it's been a big help in identifying trends in foods, exercise and times of day. I love that it syncs itself to both phones so both of us can make/view entries no matter where we are. I can't wait to show her dr!",
3122,5,2014-02-21T21:21:56.000Z,sculptor451,Great so far!,"This is the first diabetic app I've used and it's great.  I like the challenges, the ease of tagging and input.  It even can accommodate my Omnipod usage.  I upgraded to pro when they had a sale.  It will be fun trying out the features, like printing out or saving all my info in a form my doctor will like.  The UI of this app is very nice, easy and intuitive to use. Thanks for making a great product!",
3123,5,2014-04-15T01:47:55.000Z,Ttomrightnow,Fantastic app for Type 1s!,"Finally!  A diabetes app that is really useful for Type 1 diabetics.  Most apps I've found are tailored more to Type 2s.  Also, if it's possible to make diabetes management fun, this app definitely does that!  Quite amusing, and clever, while still being very useful.  It also seems like the creators really care and understand which I love.  Definitely recommend mySugar!!!! :)",
3124,5,2014-09-22T18:23:33.000Z,Momi2katie,Revolutionary,I have been diagnosed for several years and was getting complacent about testing and watching what I ate. This has really helped me get back on track by making it fun and educational.  It's making me think about what and when I eat/exercise. The little monster is just so funny!  I laugh now when I record everything instead of heaving a sigh of frustration.,

3127,5,2016-10-11T07:00:50.000Z,LuckyPineapple,Wonderful!!,Thank you thank you thank you for this app. It's colorful design makes it a fun app to use. And taming the Diabetes Monster makes me want to keep coming back and stay on top of my diabetes. I'm 30 and have been diabetic for almost 13 years and nothing has encouraged me as much as MySugr! I've been using this app for over 3 years and I'm doing so much better because of it.,

3129,5,2017-03-26T19:04:57.000Z,@Alc&,Excellent full/featured app to track blood sugar readings,This is a easy to use app to record your glucose meter readings.  Which then allows you to see at a glance what's going on and where you have been. Second only to the meter itself you need a log to help manage your diabetes. MySugr is excellent at doing that.  And its robust features allow you to get as detailed as you want.,
3130,5,2014-03-01T14:11:53.000Z,obh3skadoo,Love it,This app is the only tool that has kept me motivated to track my blood sugars and meals for longer that a couple of days.  It would be perfection if I could also track how much protein I eat.  I use the notes function for now. I email'd this as a suggestion and rec'd a prompt and warm reply that they would bring it up in a mtg. My 4th grader likes to play with my diabetes monster as do I.,
3131,5,2014-09-06T05:44:42.000Z,Guess who!?!?,Amazing app!,"This app has really helped me so much with managing my diabetes. Before, I was really struggling with keeping on track with my blood sugars and staying on top of them.

Definitely impressed!(:",
3132,5,2015-03-28T16:04:58.000Z,Braumeuster,Best of the bunch,I probably tried 10 different apps the week following our daughter's diagnosis if T1DB. This is the only one I found that would reliably sync and output reports that are clear and easily emailed to our doctor right from the device. We are syncing this app with three iPhones and three iPads and it works great. Worth the annual subscription price--look no further. *****,

3137,5,2016-07-24T04:06:04.000Z,MomThryn,Family and Kid Friendly,This app works well for our family with a newly diagnosed Type 1 12 year old. All three of us can see on our phones his logbook and any of us can log at anytime. Print out is great for Doctor appts. Only wish it had a carb counter attached that added up the carbs and figured out the ratio!   Then it would be 10 stars!  Thank you for such a great app.,

Since using this app, along with a carb counting companion app, I have maintained a good blood sugar, and have drastically lowered my A1C to 6.1!!! Only suggestion would be a food diary with a carb counter, and water intake that will link with the Apple health app. Recommend to any and all diabetics.",

3146,3,2016-01-05T11:35:34.000Z,Eddieov,App is ok,The app offers quite a few features.  I really dislike the camera feature. It is hard to get the camera to focus. I also wish the camera feature did more than just remind you what you have eaten. It would be nice if you can take a pic or a scan feature so it can automatically enter the carbs ect.  Keep in mind I bought the pro. I feel it takes to long to log something. But over all it is a pretty good log book.,

This app, which gives you an A1c estimation is great. When I started, my A1c was 5.6. With this app, some serious diet changes and many finger stick later, my estimated A1c is 5.0. That is not to say the app is accurate, but I wanted that goal and the app is really helping me obtain it.",
3158,5,2016-09-25T14:47:49.000Z,CoilySweets,AMAZING!!!,"This app is awesome!  Once I purchased the full app the logging possibilities clearly eliminated several other apps. You can not only log your blood sugar but you can take pictures of your meals, log how many carbs, your blood pressure, exercises, and much more!  So far I'm loving this app! Now if only they can make this app compatible with the apple health app that would be stellar!",
3159,5,2016-11-27T18:54:06.000Z,Fundamentist,A little confusing,"I think I like this app, but I'm still trying to figure it all out, like how to put in that you took some insulin based on your insulin:carb ratio but didn't check before you ate (my insurance only pays for 4 test strips a day).",

All around great app for diabetics of any type!",
3162,5,2014-12-29T23:10:35.000Z,twerppoet,Best Tracker Yet,"This is one of the easiest diabetic tracking apps I’ve tried. Entry is quick. I can make the vital entries quickly, then go back and add extra information later as needed. Along with the Health Kit integration (so I can use other apps for workout and diet tracking) and cvs export (for my spreadsheet habit) it’s made my data tracking and analysis easier than ever.",

So once I found this I was super excited. My endocrinologist gets really mad when I don't have blood logs for her to look at for any patterns, so she recommended an app since us teenagers always have our phones. I love it, and I am never going back!",

And I looked at a few apps before trying this one and I love that it includes gestational as a type of diabetes. Many diabetes apps don't do that.

I like that I can include as much detail as I want but at the same time, I can see the big picture from broader analysis. A definite for those trying to get a better handle on their glucose control! Best app I've seen! I'm shocked more people don't know about it!",

My A1C is 6.5 because of this app, and I will convince every Type 1 I know to use it. MERCI!",

I would love to see them integrate a food log similar to MyFitnessPal that synced macros though, and for some reason it won't let me widen my view by turning my phone sideways. Since my access is all on a phone, I can't see all of my daily data without scrolling. It's a minor inconvenience, but it would be nice to be able to utilize that function.",

Having the ability to see my progress keeps me motivated to lower my glucose levels.  The auxiliary features the app provides like points for meals seemed cumbersome so I abandoned using the other features.  The app is GREAT for how I use it, and yea least I forget the cool sounds you get when imputing your sugar readings.  Tooooo cute.",

It's super convenient, and has helped me log more consistently than I ever have in the 11 years I have had diabetes.",

The fun factor it give makes you want to take your blood sugar where as in the past it was a pain for me.  I would recommend this app to anyone afflicted with diabetes. It kinda makes it as fun as it can be.,

I guess that this is more geared toward kids, we (somewhat!) older people need more explicit instructions. But, after I'd figured it out, I've really found it helpful, and I will definitely keep using this.",
3193,5,2014-09-21T22:05:15.000Z,IndyHansons,Just what I need,Having data is critical to managing my diabetes. The gamification of collecting that data is very well balanced. Enough to motivate me with being so much that it feels silly. I bought the app to get the extra features. I especially like having photos of meals that were difficult for me to carb-count. I later review them with my dietician.,

3195,3,2015-05-18T09:16:04.000Z,MrWheeler77,Handy but no buy option.,I like what options are available in the free option but can't give it more than 3 stars because reporting options are limited in free option. I would but this app if you could but they require a subscription rather than a one time option which I am not interested in. Make it buy able not subscription and I would try the pro version and maybe rate higher.,

That's a really shabby and unfair thing to do to users, and it's not like the App Store let's you back grade to a better old version of it to compensate for this stupidity. If they're going to get greedy like this, I think it's time to start looking for a different logbook app.",

I am very brittle and have food allergies on top of the type1, and this tool makes dealing with food and bgs easier.

I hate the finger sticks and having to eat small meals closer together.  Remembering the protocol is still new to me.  This app does make a not fun lifestyle change a little less, well, not fun.  Even for a middle-aged busy lady, it does keep a humorous slant on accountability...and in my book, that is pretty good!",

For time of blood sugar/meal you can't record earlier blood sugars and mark the correct time. So when I think to log all my blood sugars at the end of the day, it looks like I ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner at 11:37pm. It also doesn't let you edit an entry so you have to know your whole meal in advance of logging it.",

My coworkers also get a kick out of the noises the monster makes when you add a new entry and so they are supportive in the tracking my glucose levels and logging my carb intake.,

I highly recommend it for anyone that is serious about tracking blood glucose levels. I love the follow up emails and the animation used in the app keep up the good work hope you get a million+ users.,
3226,4,2016-12-11T14:44:08.000Z,Saagfdhhfsum,"I love this app, and would have given it a five BUT...","It needs a place to record weight.  I cannot afford to pay for the ""pro version"" - after all having a chronic disease like this is expensive.  Nor do I care to have any of the other features.  But it would be very helpful to keep weight loss on the same app and not using a different one just for that.",

Makes tracking things easy and something I look forward to! Would suggest to allow option for oral medications though. I just use the insulin option as a substitute but that's a way this could be improved.,

My two quibbles are that you can only track carbs, not calories or fats (the later being especially important as too much fat in the diet can also interfere with insulin absorption), and Aldo that there doesn't seem to be a way to turn the 'steps' field off. Otherwise, a nice app that I will continue to use.",

Only thing I wish for is reports in black and white (color ink is expensive) and an untimed way to log exercise that showed up in the daily total. A1c estimates have been accurate for us after using a few months. Love the notes section too.,

3264,5,2016-12-27T16:12:12.000Z,Madamouselle Izzi,Eye opening,This app really forced me to keep track of carbs. Very easy to use & the standard deviation of low and high blood glucose levels helped me focus on managing the hypo/hyper numbers I was experiencing. It illustrates way more info than my Accu-Chek Connect but it would be great to have the meter linked to the app so I don't have to input bg twice.,

It estimates my a1c, I can track my sugars, carbs, insulin, and even whether or not I'm feeling hypo/hyper. The game-like feel to data entry keeps me motivated.

It is a little hard for someone like a caregiver who doesn't use the app a lot to figure out previous or even current trends. My partner is baffled and it even took me some while to figure it out.

I can't speak for the food side yet as I'm just tracking glucose levels and night time insulin right now. It works great for these.,

I would recommend this to anyone with diabetes.  Huge thank you to the people who created this app.  Well worth the money!,
3452,5,2015-02-19T14:28:01.000Z,TheDigsNYC,Excellent,"If you are looking for an app to help you control your sugar intake, to control your insulin, then this is it. Easy to use, it is probably the best app for those people who don't want to get highly technical. Simple to use, it maintains your records and maintains your analytics.",
3453,5,2016-05-10T14:35:20.000Z,Sandyfred,Very useful!,This also helps keep up with your A1c. I'm not sure how accurate. I will find out at my next checkup. Allows you to see what foods might be raising your sugar levels. For a free app it's pretty good. I'm thinking of getting the paid version.,
3454,1,2016-08-17T15:00:23.000Z,Paula Ellis,Crashes upon opening,"I liked this app when I first got it, however, at this point, it crashes when I initially open it. The scanner module I purchased for it is unreliable. It frequently picks a date from last year, even though my meter doesn't display the year. So you'd think the current year would be an implicit assumption for this app, but no, it's not. Getting the data from the scanner reliably into the log is hit or miss too.",
3455,5,2016-12-04T15:24:23.000Z,Susancfl,Excellent,"This app is great for tracking your blood sugar, food intake, and activity. It estimates your A1C after so many readings and all data is automatically transferred to Apple's My Health app. Information can be exported to physicians' office easily.

3462,2,2015-05-29T17:26:18.000Z,snatalie,Do not like the update,The update looks great but it is missing my favorite features like syncing with Apple health. It was so cool to have my Dexcom share data on mysugr! And it's harder to find info. I miss the analysis section. I also cannot find where I used to put my A1c result. Please bring back these old functions. It's upsetting to purchase something for particular features and then those features are dropped.,
3463,5,2015-06-08T14:56:53.000Z,RatingsMaster,Fantastic App,I don't have any complaints the app only keeps getting better. Ever since I was diagnosed with Type 1 about a month ago this app has helped me log and keep track of sugar levels. Highly recommend,

3472,1,2014-02-12T20:22:47.000Z,BACT00,More of a Game,"I've been using Glucose Buddy for a few years now and thought I'd try this app. I read the reviews and decided to purchase the full app. Unfortunately, this app is too gimmicky and seems to be more about challenges and points vs seriously tracking your blood sugar. This app does not allow you to clearly follow your readings before and after each meal. The app is more suited for younger kids. I would recommend Glucose Buddy if you want a clear and simple app.",
3473,5,2014-12-09T19:59:10.000Z,Diabetickidonfleek,WOW!!!!,This app is absolutely incredible. It helps me keep track of my blood sugar as I often forget to check my bg.

4632,5,2014-11-12T03:22:53.000Z,Vlady829x7,Wonderful app!  Needs 10 stars,"I love this app. I've been type 2 for over 10 years and have tried a lot if different logs. This one is the best by far. For the past two years I resorted to an excel worksheet out of frustration with other apps. One of my coworkers overseas recommended this one and I'm extremely pleased. I downloaded the free version and immediately upgraded to the pro version. I have a form of diabetes that is hard to control with large swings in my bg levels; as a result I test about 7 times per day. It's easy to enter data into the log and I love scrolling through the pictures to see what I did right or wrong. I also like staging my food pics to see where I've been during the day. I have an extremely hectic job that is fun but makes me likely to quickly forget that I'm diabetic. The mysugr team responded quickly to my emails and I haven't had any issues with the app loading. After about 4 weeks of usage I find I am logging more now than I did in the first week. Since I started using the app I have had a significant reduction in the number of high values (only 2) and low values (none too low) which is awesome considering I started about a week before  the devils holiday , aka Halloween. My family likes to pick up my phone and scroll through the pictures; they are also big fans. We now have more constructive discussions about how my day is going, which is great. My sons want to find an app like this for non-diabetics. Even the little monster is starting to grow on me. The mysugr team has some improvements to do on the nutritional aspects, but overall I agree with the other reviewers, this app is a life saver.",

4997,4,2017-01-18T04:14:32.000Z,Leighav20,Great,"This app is wonderful. 5 year old daughter is Type 1. We found ourselves needing to remember what she had eaten in the last few days, up to a week prior and couldn't recall. This app lets you put food entries and so much more. It has helped us to keep up with her changing insulin needs just by logging her meals, carbs and correction amounts. She uses a pump and we are able to correct by 0.025. The only complaint I have about this app (and why I gave the app 4 stars instead of 5) is that when I go to log the app the correction her pump says for her food/high, I can only put two decimal places instead of the three that the pump does. Currently, I just put a note on the entry that says if she was given a correction that ends with a 5. The way the app does it right now isn't an issue if, for example the pump gives her a 1.250U correction; I just put it in the app as is. But, if she gets, for example, a 1.225U correction instead, I have to make a note on the entry to clarify that she got the .225U correction, not just .220U. Other than that small hiccup, it's fantastic and wonderful and we love it. We don't let her use the app herself because she can't read yet but she watches us do the entries and we let her poke her diabetes monster. In time, we're going to teach her to use it since she'll be starting school this coming August. We plan to use it and have the school nurse, and possibly teachers, use the app to help us track her diabetes while she's at school. I find the diabetes monster noises particularly cute, myself. There is a kid version of the app which we have fiddled with a bit. She will probably use that instead of this one when she is a bit older but still. It's a great app. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with diabetes. In fact, I have to my aunt who is Type 2. :)",

The testing kit/ starter kit accu check is cheap and terrible and is not worth the 49.00 a month. It constantly has connection issues and when letting support know of the issue constantly they just keep informing me to reset Bluetooth. And requiring customers to commit for three months is insane considering issues with my accu check began within the first three weeks. Stay away I only use this to log sugars from my libre.,

Pretty cool app - I’m a no, I don’t want to waste my data space person however I don’t feel I’ve wasted space or time with this app and yes I suggest using it. It does give me something to look forward to while I’m in the hospital and I think it would encourage diabetics to keep track of their insulin and BG and we do need encouragement that isn’t annoying.

I asked it to send the code to two different emails about six times each and never received an email.  Yes, I checked the spelling of the email address each time, and that is not the issue.  The issue is a glitch in the app.  Unfortunately, no one from the developer checks to make sure the app is working, and there is no way to contact the developer to let them know it screwed up.  So, save your time and energy and find another app that works when you install it.","I am so sorry you're having difficulties signing up for the mySugr app Rhonda!

I do wish they would not focus solely on IOS for the improvements. I've asked about Android & was told ""maybe down the road"". V. Disappointing. I had to go back to iPhone for last big roll out 🙁.",

I didn't know how to manage it before, but now I can see where I've been and where I'm going with dosing my insulin.  It makes keep track for my MD a snap.  Thanks for making it so user friendly, not to mention a cute user interface. ;)",
5472,5,2016-10-09T22:00:02.000Z,DBglutenfree,my Sugr Review,I have been using this app since last spring and I like the up to the minute info it gives me each time I use it! I enjoy the weekly updates that are sent on my email and they help me make decisions too. I was able to print from my IPhone for my MD last spring but since then I have not been able to.,
5473,5,2016-10-29T17:49:11.000Z,AlasKen,Works for me,I find this app helps my track and therefore lower my A1c. Was in low 9s in January. I am now in low 6s. Only difference is tracking it all in one place and therefore doing what I should. I track my time walking and walk 2 - 4 miles a day syncing with Apple health. Tracking carbs and looking for 100 - 150 a day. Monitoring bg levels 3 times a day. I have type 2 and the awareness has made the difference.,
5474,5,2016-11-05T13:12:21.000Z,Tpmgdtjud,Recently diagnosed with type 2,"Love this app! Having just recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes I struggled with tracking my levels, meals, exercise, and understanding their connection.This app has simplified the process for me and I can see what is & isn't working for me very quickly and adjust accordingly.",
5475,4,2016-11-30T00:15:33.000Z,Angelini1973,Nice app,For obvious reasons I need to keep track of my blood sugars for my doctors reference.so far I've been happy with the ease and functions. I do wish I could see a report with all of my numbers kind of in a spreadsheet form. I understand in the premium version there is something like this that you can export to an email form.,
5476,5,2017-01-31T00:35:54.000Z,Lenadollcollect,Just started,My doctor hit me with a sarcastic comment about my A1c and it hit a nerve this time. I needed a app to help me keep track of my blood sugars on a daily basis. I can't wait to record my blood sugar each time I take it and can see how my eating affects it. I'm still learning how this app works. Will update in a few weeks after my next a1c.,
5477,1,2017-02-26T17:51:29.000Z,RubyCaves,$35.88 per year,"I went to the search option & all these colorful icons appeared. I thought this looks great. Icon after icon I tapped read ""This is a Pro Feature!"" I googled the cost of the Pro feature;$2.99 per MONTH!  Not a one time charge or yearly charge, it's a MONTHLY fee that adds up to just under $36 a year. I'm removing this app after the review and downloading a simple diary app.",
5478,1,2017-02-27T21:44:51.000Z,Maddog11RonS,Very Disappointed,"mySugr was very disappointing.  I downloaded the free version just after my diabetes diagnosis.  It came with very little details of operation, so it took me several hours to figure the basic operation and a week later I was still figuring out the many nuances.  I was shocked by the cost of the “pro features”: $2.99/mo. or $27.99 for the year.  I was excited with mySgr because it touted an “estimated HbA1c.”   So, I poked my fingers 3x/day for 7 days to get 21 BG readings.  When I then selected the HbA1c with all those reading, the app gave me an alert that it was only available in pro features.  Nowhere did it specify that Est. HbA1c was only available in pro features.  I went back to the app description at the App Store and reviewed that.  It listed “Features/Add-ons” but did not clarify which Features/Add-ons were part of the paid version.  Even in the intra-app “logbook manual” describing Est. HbA1c, there was no mention of it being a pro feature.   I felt deceived.  Seven days of sticking my fingers to then find out that I was misled.  I was so furious I finally just quit using the app and found other means to track my readings like the Apple Heart App.  Also, I didn’t care for the childish animation, badges, and sound effects.  I am deleting this app.",
5479,5,2017-06-21T07:20:06.000Z,Dixieii2003,Great app! Very helpful!,The app is easy to use. I can see all the results in one page. The report feature makes it easy for me to just click and send it to my doctor. Thank you!,

Update 11/6/14 lowered rating was a 5 but lately I have had to resign in occasionally when I go to log. They need to fix it. UPDATE: I deleted the app because of the issue had before and they updated the app and I reinstalled it and added new features and it works great. Changed my rating to 5 stars.,

It really does encourage you to keep using it and help you visualize trends and lower your blood sugars.",

5489,3,2016-08-17T05:23:51.000Z,ALENABRAH108BRAH,Review,"It's a good app to keep track of your daily glucose levels. It's good for general record-keeping. The sounds are annoying and not too relevant. The logo is creepy as well. However, the app does a good job of letting you know what your glucose levels are and what they have been. Just eat more fiber and watch it go down. @drwashing",

5493,5,2014-07-31T18:36:47.000Z,Rblueyz,So helpful!!!!,I just got diagnosed with gestational diabetes in my third trimester of pregnancy. You can imagine how hard it is to learn all the diabetes stuff while being completely exhausted and 8 months pregnant. This app has really mad it easy for me. The reminders are good so I don't for get and it's so handy to have at every doctor appointment! I even told my nutritionist about it and she loved it too and is going to recommend it to other patients!!!! I also think it's great they have a junior version for kids!!! I paid for the full app and I feel like $19.99 was worth it! Plus the support team is really on top of answering any questions you have.,
5494,5,2014-10-29T14:19:20.000Z,MoriahSue,Priceless,"I recently took in an insulin dependent Type 1 foster kid. She didn't come with instructions! She was removed from last home for medical concerns and her numbers were all over the chart. This app has been priceless in helping me track everything and work on getting her numbers in check. The charts have allowed me to communicate with the school nurse better, and once I can finally get a doctor appointment scheduled we can analyze her trends! I started with the free version, but quickly upgraded to the paid version. This app is easy enough for the both of us to use. We both have it downloaded on our phone and as long as you log in with the user ID you do not need to pay the upgraded amount for each device. Just a one time payment of $19.99.",
