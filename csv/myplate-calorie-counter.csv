0,5,2020-08-18T10:57:29.000Z,J in Portland Maine,Love this app,"I started with Noom but tracking my food was the only part of that program that seemed useful to me and I didn‚Äôt like it much even for that. With Noom there were a lot of clicks required and irritating pop up messages following every single food entry. So I decided to for search for a free app just to track food. Next I tried MyFitnessPal. That lasted less than a day. Then I tried MyPlate. I‚Äôve been using it for about a week and I‚Äôm loving it. It‚Äôs easy to use, clean interface, minimal junk, ads, or other annoyances. Plus it has features I didn‚Äôt even know I wanted like showing how close my intake tracks to my goal percentages for each macronutrient. The goals are also nicely customizable. I‚Äôve already lost a couple pounds. Now I‚Äôve signed up for one of their meal plans which is something I wasn‚Äôt even considering before trying the app. I‚Äôm super happy to have a grocery list of healthy foods all prepared for me (big time and effort saver there) and to try some new recipes this coming week. My only request would be if they could offer the option to double or quadruple recipe quantities since I‚Äôm cooking for a family. But obviously I can do that myself. At the price of free this thing is a heck of a deal. 5 stars. Update: The first day‚Äôs meal plan arrived. The meals didn‚Äôt appeal to me so I‚Äôm probably not going to do that after all. Still loving the app though.","Hi J! Thanks for your feedback! We‚Äôre glad you are enjoying MyPlate.

1,4,2020-07-11T11:41:52.000Z,RP 1015,Just Learning,"I am one of ‚Äúthose people‚Äù that never had to worry about my weight...until I hit 60 and quit smoking. Because I used to be able to eat whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted, I never understood the correlation between food and gaining weight. Fast forward five years and I packed on the weight. I‚Äôve been living with it for three years and decided it was time to start losing some of this again. I knew any fad diet was not going to work for me, so I decided to start paying attention to what I‚Äôm eating and how much I‚Äôm eating. Not having any idea what foods are high in calories or carbs or proteins, I decided to download an app to help me. After reading the reviews on My Plate I decided to try it and I was absolutely amazed at how easy this was to do. Not only am I able to keep track of my portions (calories), but I am learning which foods are high in carbs, fat and protein. I am almost 4 weeks in and have lost 4 1/2 pounds. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is how the list of food I have entered is saved. If you originally enter it for lunch and another time do you want to have it for dinner you have to search for it in the list under lunch and then add it to dinner for that day. I also wish there were some sort of organization to it so you could sort them alphabetically and be able to delete ones that you know you‚Äôre not going to use anymore.  If there is a way to delete them, I can‚Äôt find it. Other than that, I think this app is well worth it.",
2,4,2020-09-01T18:58:29.000Z,Tonioo U,More Accessibility,"I have been using MyFitnessPal for a long time and was looking for a refreshing new experience. Came across your app and actually I think I prefer it more than MyFitnessPal, the concept and it‚Äôs compatibility with the iPhone‚Äôs software makes me (an iPhone user) want to rather use this app instead of MyFitnessPal. I want to make this my go to app except for one feature, the fact that the color choice of the app is in relation to your iPhone being in light mode or dark mode. As someone who prefers having my phone in dark mode, when I opened the app and saw the screen dark, it was a turn off for me. Some people may think otherwise and prefer the dark mode, but to me it gave a depressing vibe. As small as this feature is, if I‚Äôm going to use an app for every meal to count calories I for sure want it to look appealing to me. I think a simple fix for this would be to give the person the option to choose whether or not they want it to be light or dark in the app settings, and to not have it based off your iPhone settings. As nit picky as this critique is, this one feature would make me switch from MyFitnessPal to your app in an instant without hesitation, but until then I‚Äôll be staying on MyFitnessPal solely because of the ability to have my screen continue to be white, even when I‚Äôm in dark mode. This is a great app, but adding in a little personal accessibility would blow the competition out of the water.","Hi Tonioo U!

3,5,2018-11-15T23:53:55.000Z,Baby2cakes,Husband lost 70 lbs just tracking calories,"I was using a different app that my PT was using. I told my husband to get an app like this. Once he got MyPlate and he was tracking his calories he realized more of what he was eating. He was better able to avoid foods that were full of empty calories and keeping track of his foods helped him see what was making him sick and what didn‚Äôt. It tracks carbs, sugars, fats, sodium, and proteins. (More than this but that‚Äôs all we use). Once he realized how much he was actually eating he started making better choices a little at a time. He wanted to see how much he could lose before he started working out and he quickly lost 60lbs. He found that he was eating more than 10,000 empty calories before. Now he keeps it to under 2,000net calories. (It subtracts calories burnt that are tracked with his iWatch- I have an iFITNESS. Which is much cheaper and it syncs to this app as well). He loves it. It‚Äôs like a game to him.  I tell everyone about this app because I‚Äôm so proud of him. Literally, all the motivation he needed was to be shown how much garbage he was eating. Now, because he‚Äôs eating less processed sugar, his sores heal faster, he‚Äôs off his gout medication,($200/month) and we‚Äôre hoping he‚Äôll be off his bp meds next visit. His teeth are in better condition without all the soda. He can‚Äôt even stand to eat all the junk because it makes him sick. LOVE THIS APP!",Wow!! Great review and great story! We're so happy for you and your husband. Thanks for sharing :)
4,5,2020-11-12T05:11:37.000Z,TaylorMarie6136,Saving my future,"Before I had gotten this app, I seriously didn't feel confident in what I was eating at all. This is is saving me and here's why. I'm 14. Before you start yapping about how I shouldn't be dieting and blah blah blah, I have very good reasons so try to hear me out. Both of my parents have very bad health and struggle with their weight a lot. Cancer runs in the family pretty strongly, and my father has hearth issues. My mom is always in pain in her joints and we are pretty sure she has a type of arthritis. I'm currently 158 pounds which is a lot- especially for my age. If I continue eating the way I do, living the way I do, or drinking as little as I do now...I could potentially not live a long healthy life. If I eat healthy and I workout everyday and try to drink 80 oz of water, I think I would actually be a healthy human. Will it stop me from cancer, arthritis, and blood pressure issues? Maybe not, but when you are healthy and living a healthy lifestyle, I believe you have a bigger chance in survival. I have been using this app everyday for about a week and it makes me really happy to say that I am losing weight as we speak! My skin looks really nice and I am finally feeling confident in my body. I am so happy to have this app, it's a life changer and a life beginner. I love that it doesn't have pop up ads either. Thank you creators ‚ú®üíõ‚ú®.",Hi there! Thank you for that awesome review.

5,5,2020-08-07T01:03:50.000Z,Djvyanksfn,Great app! Even without purchasing the subscription,"This app is great! I have been overweight for the last 20 years and I never thought that I would be able to lose the weight.  I downloaded this app with pretty low expectations. After using it for a few days and seeing everything that it helps you keep track of, I was addicted. Between accurately tracking my caloric intake with this app, and eating minimal processed foods, I have lost 40 lbs in about two and a half months and I am officially in a healthy weight range again! You can set a goal of how much weight you want to lose (or gain) and it will show you your daily calorie goal. It has a great graphing function that will help you keep track of progress for the last year. It tracks your daily calories, weight, BMI, carb intake, sugar intake, and so much more. Watching the line on the graph go down for the last few months has really kept me motivated. I couldn‚Äôt have lost the weight without using this app. If you are serious about keeping track of your diet and becoming healthier, I highly recommend the free download. I‚Äôm still using the free version, but I am so impressed with the results, I am going to purchase it tonight to see all of the other stats that I can track.","Hi Djvyanksfn!

It‚Äôs simple to enter your food and I do find most of the products I use are listed, with a few exceptions. The search feature is lacking a bit. A lot of times I can type exactly the name of a product into the search and it won‚Äôt find it, and sometimes just pulls up weird totally unrelated stuff. Often I have to scan the barcode to find things. Overall I think the use of this is generally fairly intuitive and more simple in layout than similar apps like MyFitnessPal. It took me a minute to figure out the excercise tracking, which I think could be set up a little better (for ease of use, the same setup as the food logging) but it‚Äôs not hard to use.",Hi there!

I would love if you had an option to pay yearly not just monthly for the gold plan because if you add that I will defiantly do the gold plan. I would be good if you did like a silver and bronze plan too that have other options. Also you should add a ** drink water remind** where we can have it remind us a few times a day. And it would be cool if we could have friends through the app and see each others calories and support each other because I do this with my mom but we have to go over calories when we‚Äôre together because I can‚Äôt just add her like a friend. Another idea in the meal prep you should have a weeks worth of recipes when you click that tab and you could change them every week. You could do it for the gold of course. Hope you read this post and get back to me. I really would love to see some of these updates it would make the app better and the pay by year would be perfect not everyone likes having another monthly bill.,"Hi zmirandaz!

11,4,2018-06-07T02:33:30.000Z,aubrydan,Almost perfect,"The app is very useful when it comes to logging meals and being able to keep track of my calories. I love that it shows me my macro total percentage-ages for the day as well. Micronutrient info and daily goals are neat but not totally necessary esp with the sodium thresholds and such available to view online. However, it is a very common and free feature of other meal tracking apps to be able to create a meal (with however many servings of individual ingredients)  and then say how many servings that meal makes. Unfortunately, with My Plate when you click on a meal you‚Äôve made, it lists all of the ingredients individually. This makes it very tedious, if not impossible, to accurately input homemade recipes. This is very annoying since I do a lot of cooking at home and meal prepping. I would love to see this one feature changed. Other than that this app is great - especially including all of the online features it allows you to input about your starting point with your body measurements along with weight. The graphs are encouraging. I‚Äôd love to give 5 stars when I‚Äôm able to make my own ‚Äúserving‚Äù sizes for homemade meals!",

Love how it gently reminds you to log in meals. Has nearly every food listed!  Love how we can see calories /weight/ exercise/ water etc by day and totals compared. Do wish it had more brand name foods but it has enough to find something similar. The ONLY negative is many similar items are listed as anyone can enter anything. And we can‚Äôt really trust all those entries in calories since they rarely ever match each other. Suggest: Can you block an entry that is same as other database entries by name and size?  And can you require users enter a quantity / size for items they enter? Sooo many user entries show ‚Äú 1 portion ‚Äù as the size but don‚Äôt say How Big that portion is!??   Or they say ‚Äú1 slice‚Äù....they don‚Äôt say how big is the slice?  I see many listing a burger size as ‚Äú1 burger‚Äù?? How big is that?  Sizes can be from 3 oz to 16 oz!?  Those entries are useless. But do love how we can enter something unique that we don‚Äôt see listed...just need details so others can use those too. Thx for a comprehensive app!",

Many unverified foods that have no information about quantity other than ‚Äú1 serving‚Äù. 2. Search engine is weak. 3.

The meal plan seemed like something fun to try, but I just don‚Äôt like it.  The recipes are not cohesive, and there is a lot of waste with the ingredients (only using 1/2 cup blueberries for the whole week) if I were to actually use this for shopping.  I don‚Äôt like contributing to so much food waste.  Also, I did not get a list of the meals and recipes until the day I start.

I was doing great in the calorie department, but my weight wasn‚Äôt changing much.  I dug a bit deeper, and thanks to the other features of the app I realized I was eating carbs mostly.  The app opened my eyes to the macros, and I did more research online.  I limited my carbs intake to under 50%, and mind you, I hadn‚Äôt been eating candy, cakes, cookies or snacks before, my weight started dropping off at about two pounds per week.  The app taught me that there are carbs in beans and vegetables, and that I need to pay attention to the macros in all the foods, including those that I had thought healthy options; my vegan home cooked meals were packed with carbs.  By balancing my diet better, I actually started feeling better almost immediately.  The fogginess is gone, I have energy, I don‚Äôt drag myself from task to task, and I‚Äôm at my lowest weight in years, and my BMI is normal.  I will reach my weight goal in a couple of weeks.

17,4,2020-11-10T03:04:36.000Z,emesm2,Great Concept,"I like this app a lot, my biggest concern, is that you should be allowed to set your age, because teens and below need a certain amount of calories, and not being a leg to set this, can make it seem like it is okay to eat less than the necessary amount regularly. I also think that there are a lot of uneducated people in the chat feature. I understand that it is hard to educate everyone, but my suggestion, would be that when you sign up for the app, to have to go through a quick flip through, things like self confidence and doing it for you, and about children needing a specific amount of calories, balancing nutrition with exercise, drinking water, etc. I also think that this app should incorporate sleep, because sleep is very important to staying healthy, because we shouldn‚Äôt be doing these things to lose weight, or be pretty, we should be doing them to be healthy and have a better quality of life. I also think that maybe there should be a kids version that not only tracks basic health things, but also teaches kids about nutrition with fun games, and entertaining exercise, it could be a fun way to get they whole family involved.","Hi emesm2!

When you first record a food you‚Äôre given a variety of options to declare how much you consumed (a serving, X cups, Y grams, etc.). But subsequent records only give you the option for the unit ‚Äúserving‚Äù, and the unit for serving is given. But it‚Äôs not always reasonable to measure things by the default unit. For instance, I added 1/2 cup of walnuts to a salad, and the next day ate about 10g of walnuts (i.e. about 5 walnut halves) as a snack. Because I had already recorded walnuts I had no option other than to record my calories as a fraction of a cup. Why? Clearly there are multiple measurement units available for most foods during the first recording, so why take those options away for subsequent recordings. I want to keep using this app, but this issue is just too frustrating, especially when there are so many alternative calorie counter apps out there.",Hello and thank you for this feedback!

I also find the chat helpful for the most part. My biggest problems with the app are the food list and the exercise list. The food list needs to be updated more often to add foods and needs to include mixed food made from scratch. For example, I made a bag of mixed dry beans with low fat reduced sodium chicken broth last night. I had to add each kind of bean one at a time, add the broth, add the onions, celery, etc. and then estimate how much I ate of each item. Ugh. The exercise app needs an overhaul and to include more types of everyday activities as exercise. I have lost 5 pounds so far. I am about a month in now and for the most part I still feel this is a fairly good app for tracking your foods and macros. I feel less positive about the chat portion and I've decided not to use that aspect of the app any longer.

With the other app I am able to find and scan in all the items, that I can't with this app which makes it much easier and faster. Also when I precede to ""add my food"" because I'm now forced to because of the lack of food items within the app, it only asks for fat, protein and carbs, which I find to not be enough information as far as nutrition, on MyFitnessPal, it asks me for sodium, fiber, sugar, vitamins, etc. which I think makes more sense.

Where is it lacking? 1) When attempting to change my calories goal manually, it doesn‚Äôt respond right away and I have to keep fixing it; 2) When trying to set my carbs, protein, and fat percentages, it only gives me the choice of percentages in 5% increments, not grams and not smaller percent increments; 3) When the app calculates grams based on percentages while inside the goals section, the app rounds down (22.5 becomes 22). However, when the app calculates grams while inside the meal tracking section the app rounds up (22.5 becomes 23). I know I am a control freak and some people think these are minor things.

The only issue I have found is the amount of inaccuracies in the stored food information. It would be really cool to have a user rating system to help verify the information of the foods listed. For example, users could upvote or downvote certain foods based on accuracy. Also, there should be a way to report/give feedback on foods that have incorrect information. I have found that even some of the ‚Äúverified‚Äù foods are wrong. For example, I compared the information from the package to the information on the app from the bacon that I had this morning. The app had the nutritional information for raw bacon listed instead of cooked. Who eats raw bacon? The same thing happens with boxed foods that have the unprepared and prepared calories listed.",

I‚Äôve been lifting seriously for the past year and went through a bulking phase where I went from 178 to 205 in a little over 6 months, in large part due to this app. A lot of the things I had been eating before using this app I didn‚Äôt know the exact makeup of the food I was intaking and with this app it helped me so much. So many other apps I tried for my meal prepping wanted to give me different things to eat and to try this and that, when all I wanted was something that could track my calories, carbs, protein, and fat intake. It was a blessing to have this. The ‚Äúmy food‚Äù part of this makes it quick and easy when, like many competitive powerlifters, you‚Äôre on a strict diet and eat the same foods at the same time every day for weeks on end.

27,5,2021-03-16T04:02:29.000Z,swaetiee,By far one of the most useful apps I have on my phone!!!,"So I‚Äôm starting a calorie deficit to try and lose some weight and this app is perfect for calculating calories. I‚Äôm also trying to stick to a 50:30:20 meal plan when it comes to carbs, proteins, and fats. It gives me a percentage of each for every meal I have and a total at the end of the day. I can enter my calorie goal and it will tell me how many calories I have left for each day. It also has other features I didn‚Äôt even know I needed but now rely on, like different articles addressing an assortment of nutritional topics or an entire meal plan where is gives you healthy recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. By far my favorite health & nutrition app I‚Äôve ever used. I‚Äôve tried MyFitnessPal, Noom, Weight Watchers, and MyPlate is by far my favorite and most useful. It also has little to no ad interferences so I‚Äôm never interrupted by them! Overall, 100% recommend it to anyone who wants to keep track of their calories and nutrition!",Hi swaetiee! Thank you for that amazing review. We're glad we are able to provide you with the tools to help you meet your goals.
28,5,2021-01-09T18:17:23.000Z,markkraube,Great app for tracking!,"I really enjoy using this tracker, even with just the free version. The aesthetic is very nice to me compared to MFP. I like that you are able to connect your fitness tracker (Apple Watch for me) and I also like that it has meal recommendations depending on your goals. I love that you are able to put in your own food if it‚Äôs not listed and build your own meals so you can add all of its contents at once, making tracking oatmeal and smoothies and my other favorite food concoctions much easier. Only downside is that you can‚Äôt track only a portion of the meals if you make more than one serving (for example I made muffins and input all the ingredients I used into a meal, until I saw I would only be able to track eating the whole batch rather than 1/6 of the meal). Besides that, I like that there‚Äôs a notification option and how you can schedule daily reminders to track.",Hi markkraube! Thank you for your review and feedback. We appreciate your support.

It is a little difficult entering the nutrition data of a portion of a complex meal, but I tend to keep things simple. It I has forced me to take a look at my actual intake and measure my portions.

31,5,2019-01-14T17:34:21.000Z,nelmoniter,This app helped me drop 60 pounds of fat,"To give backstory, I was an offensive lineman in high school. I was D2 quality coming out of my junior year. My senior year was filled with injuries and eventually I needed shoulder surgery. This surgery and the subsequent recovery process lead me to peruse academics as my means of scholarship. After I had decided this, I was left with about 3 more months of physical therapy. After my physical therapy was done, I was left an atrophied mess. The muscles I once used to push and block were now faded and flabby. I was fat. During my years of football, I had always wanted to be a leaner, more athletic version of myself. I now had the ability to do so, no longer needing the weight for football purposes.",
32,5,2019-05-11T15:29:27.000Z,AJER09040708,Beneficial to my weight loss and muscle gain.,"In July of 2018 I was 204. That kind of weight on my 5‚Äô7‚Äù frame was not good or healthy. I began exercising and was struggling to notice any loss of weight. I heard about MyPlate and began tracking my calories. Being able to monitor my Proteins, Carbs, and Fats allowed me to know exactly what I was getting from one meal to the next. By being able to see if I was meeting my daily macro nutrient goals allowed me to adjust my nutrition accordingly and the weight began to almost fall off. One week I decided to measure everything on a scale to input exactly what my caloric intake was. Not that I would recommend this for everyone or for any consistent time, but in that week I lost at least a pound a day and still felt energized due to getting exactly what was needed for my body to lose weight and still maintain action. I do recommend this app to anyone looking to lose weight and/or gain mass.",

I love that it has a verified badge next to items when you search, because I feel overwhelmed by the amount of choices/repeats in most other calorie trackers. The layout is easy to use and the ads are unintrusive in the free version. However, the chat/forum that I thought would be helpful to me is absolutely overrun with 14 & 15 year old girls who are trying to get from 112 to 109. Girls.... live your life and stop starving yourself. It was so depressing to read and amounted to about every other post as far as I could see. The community was great about telling them to cut it out but it didn‚Äôt seem to help. I had to delete the app off my phone because I couldn‚Äôt handle it. My advice to the developers is to ban teenagers off this app- most teens do not need to be dieting, and if they do for health reasons it should be with the help of a doctor, not an app.",Thank you for this feedback!

The only thing I would suggest to improve is the comment section and the sugar intake system. It would be nice if there was a reply button to other people‚Äôs comments in the community to make things easier to write and read. It‚Äôs kind of just a bunch of comments and to understand what people are talking about you‚Äôd have to read ALL of the comments instead of just the reply section or the original comment that was replied to. It would also be nice if the sugars could be separated from added sugars so it can be clear how much added sugar we should be eating and how much natural sugars we should be eating. As a fruit lover, I love eating my fruits with a low-calorie dip but it‚Äôs super hard to tell if I‚Äôm going over my added sugars or my natural sugars.","Hi solimarrrrrrrrr! Thanks for reaching out!

37,4,2020-04-09T15:00:55.000Z,The Virtual Keyboardist,"Solid app for weight loss, but could use a few tweaks","I am very pleased with My Plate.  I have lost 40 pounds so far, so there is no doubt that the app works well.  There are a few areas where it could be improved.  1.  Once you create a meal, there is no way to edit that meal later in the free version - I don‚Äôt know if the Gold version allows for editing.  This is an inconvenience that could be easily fixed.  2.  I have a recurring item that I am unable to get rid of.  It is not on repeat, and just shows up randomly every few days.  3. The calories database unfortunately contains some false calorie counts for several food items...even some that are ‚Äúverified‚Äù.  I expect this is due to the social nature of the app and people entering incorrect data.  So I always scan barcodes, and for other items when I doubt I do online research. Overall - I love the weight loss I‚Äôm experiencing with My Plate, it would just be nice to have a few of the items above addressed.","Hello! Congratulations on your success and thank you for this feedback. You can edit a custom meal by swiping left on the meal and selecting the ""edit"" button that appears. Please send us an email at support@livestrong.com so that we can address the repeating item issue immediately! Lastly, we do not currently offer keto meal plans or recipes so we'd love some more feedback on why you feel the app pushes this diet.

Not only is there nothing original about the nutrition materials you get with the subscription, but the shopping lists are outrageous. Aside from that you really don‚Äôt get anything else from the app except access to extra data points, which don‚Äôt do anything at all except inform you about what you‚Äôve consumed. Their server went down for several days, and during that time no one was able to log meals unless it was something they had already eaten that was stored in local memory. I inquired about the issue and asked for a refund, and Kali let me know that the server was down but ignored my request for a refund.

43,5,2019-05-08T14:39:33.000Z,C2Run,Easy and effective,"This app works because of its simplicity and its persistence. It is easy because I don‚Äôt have to look up a bunch of recipes or nutritional values. Most everything I eat is already on a list I select. Even the junk food.  It is persistent through reminders that make it almost impossible to ignore. I started by tracking everything I ate without trying to change anything. This gave me a few weeks of data showing all my bad habits. Even after drinking cokes and eating way too much Chick Fil A, I found myself staying under my calorie goal. My calories burned are easy to enter by selecting items from a list such as my favorites ‚Äî walking the dog and gardening. After establishing a routine of using the app, I started focusing more on the nutrition values. I have only used the basic free version of the app.",
44,5,2019-05-09T17:36:59.000Z,GetAttention.work - Josh Pies,App changed my life,"My doctor gave me the bad news that my blood pressure was high, my cholesterol was high, was prediabetic, And surprise-surprise... I was overweight. Time to make a change. I started using this app to track my food and get a clear understanding of how I was eating and exercising. Committing to inputting the information was not easy for the first few days but it became a habit. I am down 20% of my original weight and all of the negative information my doctor gave me has been addressed and there‚Äôs no longer a problem. My Apple Watch syncs my activity to the app seamlessly and helps me really understand what I‚Äôve been up to and give me motivation to do a little bit better every day. The real change comes with you, the person using the app, but this app unlocked clarity of understanding and discipline that I‚Äôve never had before.",
45,5,2019-06-26T07:52:49.000Z,FiFiMertens,Best free calorie tracking app by far,"I haven‚Äôt tried any of the paid features, but even the free options allow me to track both meals & water, which is more than most other free apps I downloaded. The design is simple and makes sense. I also participate in a meal kit service which supplies nutritional facts for each meal; this app makes it easy to enter those facts and track and chart those calories & macros. No better free app for this - I checked all the apps recommended by Apple HealthKit. Apps that looked slightly better usually had a cost for the app itself, and/ or anywhere from $10-$40 monthly fee. At $10 for a single month, $5/mo for 6 months, or $3.75/mo for a year, the Gold membership may well be worth it. Having so many free resources in an app is really heartening; I might upgrade to gold just to support this app & it‚Äôs developers. Thank you.","Thank you for the awesome review!

My foods and meals are saved. I am not sure if recipes I added years ago are there. My frustration with the new version: I see photos of foods under recipes. But I cannot click on them. I went to the recipe page and typed spicy cauliflower wings in the search. Nothing happened. What a teaser! My other frustration: I eat almost no processed foods. When I type in a food, the corporate foods come up first. So I must always be typing in the word homemade, like homemade pasta. Yes we make our own pasta. And I would pay for the gold version if it calculated calcium. As a Medicare adult, I need 1200 units of calcium a day. My bone density is on the borderline. I need to count and don‚Äôt want all of it to come from supplements. I bet a lot of women would appreciate this addition for their health.",
48,5,2019-06-22T02:54:44.000Z,squidDilly,"App is pretty great, but can only measure 100 grams of food?","So the app pretty much has everything I want. I like the food selection, make your own food feature, weight tracking, progress view etc, it‚Äôs all great. There is 1 problem that is major though (for non US people). The grams parameter in the food serving size is limited to 100. People who use metric (everyone in the world except US) have to convert grams to ounces if a serving you eat is over 100 grams. This is actually a pretty lame limitation, since 100 grams is only 3.5 ounces. The reason I‚Äôm using this app in the first place is so I don‚Äôt have to calculate and convert calories myself, so having to convert to ounces is inconvenient. The app is otherwise better than all the other apps I‚Äôve tried, so I‚Äôm gonna keep using it. But it would literally be perfect without this limitation.",

Sodium is a big one for me. I like that My Plate sets a sodium limit for the day and shows my progress so I always know how close I am to my daily limit. However, if I customize my sodium limit, the line graph showing progress doesn‚Äôt work. Also, the last two days, looking at my daily totals by individual day, it looks like I stayed well under my limits. However, I just looked at the progress for the last week and selected sodium. That view shows that I exceeded the sodium limit the last two days. The mg counts are much higher than they show for each day. I have no idea which is right. I don‚Äôt see an option to ask anyone about it. I was so excited when I found that My Plate tracking was so detailed, now I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs not reliable.

Something else I would add would be the possibility of changing the calories/macros some products have. You can only change the serving size but there are times when it‚Äôs inaccurate.

If I need to edit a meal, that is next to impossible as the ‚Äúedit‚Äù link in the meal is so small, I can‚Äôt activate it to make changes.

I can see what my fat and calorie intake is, and it‚Äôs easy to see, but it doesn‚Äôt show what my recommended intake should be, so I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm going over or not. Additionally, yesterday I told it to sync with my fitness app on my phone, and today the option to sync showed up again, and when I clicked it thinking that info was also erased, I ended up with double everything on my phone app.  I would like something that isn‚Äôt too hard to use to enter food and track calories, but it‚Äôs pointless if I‚Äôm going to have to re-enter Items every day and try to remember what else I ate the day before.","Hi there, we're so sorry for this inconvenience.

Just trying to figure out what percentage you should have based on your body and life is like trying to remember my college calculus classes. This app does it all for you and it is amazing! We moved abroad to Europe, and finding a routine and healthy eating given all of the new products was really hard. I gained 8-10 pounds and no matter what I did I could not get rid of it. I had a sense that macro proportions were the key, and sure enough...weight is coming off. I use the scanner and the auto populate is magnificent. I exercise heavily and the app adds those calories back, but I‚Äôm sticking to the low end of 1200 calories to lose quickly.

70,5,2017-09-25T12:09:56.000Z,Subssjb,Love it! Love it! Love it!,I downloaded this app the summer of my freshman year of college (after the freshman 15 was gained). I became really interested in eating healthy and working out but soon realized I got way to skinny way too fast. I started using this app to make sure that I was staying healthy on my fitness journey and I have not stopped using it since (about 3.5 years). I never needed to purchase the upgrade because the free app had everything I needed. I love the scanner and that it has to option to look up restaurant food as well. Overall amazing app for tracking food but it's much harder to track workouts on the free version. This is fine for me because I'm just using it to make sure that I meet my daily calorie and macronutrient requirements!,
71,2,2018-09-11T16:08:06.000Z,Melissnicole82,My review!,"Would love it if it listened to me. No point putting your meal times and preferences in. So if your intermittent fasting or eat later than 10 am don't bother with this app. It won‚Äôt listen to you. It suggests mega low calorie meal plan in my emails thats 1500 less than I actually need, and it reminds me to have breakfast FIVE hours earlier than I put in that I do. The ONLY thing this app is decent for is counting your calories and tracking what you eat. But don‚Äôt expect your times, and all info to be correct for you. Im rating a one bc I am so dang frustrated everyone making things that do not work. Apps that do not work right. People who do not do their jobs proficient etc. Tired of wasting money! That is also why it was important to me bc I am trying to save money eating like this, and Im eating like this to save my life I have been sick a few years. Anyway that‚Äôs all! Don‚Äôt bother with it if you are tracking thoroughly",

73,5,2018-12-28T20:03:32.000Z,Carlosvhgfdgjh,Great app if your serous,I‚Äôm not new to fitness and diet. I have been training and counting macros for over 10years.  I‚Äôve also set up meal plans and gotten great results but now I‚Äôm trying the Keto diet. I wasn‚Äôt use to eating so much fat I I needed an app to count my macros for me and check percentages so I can make sure I‚Äôm eating enough fat and not going over on my protein. I two weeks I‚Äôve lost 4lb which weight loss was not my intention when starting this diet but I can say that all the weight I‚Äôve lost have been water and fat. I‚Äôve seen an incredible amount of definition around my lower stomach and lower back. This app has made it very easy for me to follow my diet and I‚Äôll make it easy for anyone else trying to follow a diet regardless of what kind of diet they want to follow.,
74,2,2019-01-27T17:16:07.000Z,kalthoffdesign,Meals need portion option,"I really love the interface of this app and that it includes a water tracker (would love reminders to drink water throughout the day). However, finding this almost unusable because I can‚Äôt add a recipe and then choose my portion size. How am I supposed to know what portion I‚Äôm eating of every ingredient that I put into a recipe without doing a bunch of time consuming calculations outside of the app? It‚Äôs another app that feels more appropriate for packaged foods, which I don‚Äôt eat because generally they‚Äôre not healthy (kinda defeats the purpose right?) I also don‚Äôt love when I add a meal that it puts each individual ingredient in my list for the day rather than just saying the meal that I ate. I‚Äôm not really sure what the point of the meal tab is if it doesn‚Äôt allow you to calculate portion size or place the name of that meal in your list of eaten foods. With this addition this app would be 5 stars, without it I probably won‚Äôt be using it.","Thanks for the review and feedback, and thank you for trying MyPlate!

I have been dedicated to MyPlate for about 8 months and it truly is a joy to use! I actually look forward to entering what goes into my mouth and it encourages me to choose my foods wisely. Prior to using MyPlate my carb intake was atrocious and I ate hardly any protein! Now, I'm better!

I also love that it gives you workout exercises and connects to other workout apps (I use Apple Health and Workout for Women) to keep track of calories burned. I have only used this app for a few days but it is one of my favorites. I don‚Äôt have the Gold (yet) but even the free version is amazing. It even keeps track of how much water you are drinking.

My ONE suggestion is that there should be a way to enter in a full recipe into the meal section (i.e. a full recipe for 4 servings), and then indicate that you either had one serving of it or 1/4 of the meal for one of your meals (I know Noom has this feature, and it‚Äôs SO helpful!).

I really wish there was an option to remove the community page, even just a switch to hide it if you choose. I understand how it‚Äôs beneficial for some, but it‚Äôs very triggering for others. Some of us are recovering and using calorie counting for things besides weight loss or others that aren‚Äôt dieting strictly, or if you‚Äôre recovering from over exercising and under eating etc, all of these things are easily triggered by the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù.

It‚Äôs very easy to learn and lets you set your own goals or simply enter your weight loss desires and it will set goals for you. I did find that the scanner cannot find many products, but to be fair I live in Central Europe so perhaps it does better with American packages. But to be completely upfront, I do have a different app that can scan many of the packages here so it is a downfall with this app. Another downfall is the ‚Äúmy recipes‚Äù portion of the app. Most people cook for families so I entered the entire recipe as I cooked it but then I wasn‚Äôt able to split that into servings. I couldn‚Äôt even say that I ate a quarter of the recipe, it was either the entire recipe or nothing. I wish that feature were added. But overall, great app, I will continue to use it.",

Similarly, when I log my breakfast of 2 carrots, 2 eggs, and 2 cups broccoli, I am told that I have had 0.3mg of sodium, when the real amount is 260mg. These issues only come up when I have to manually enter those foods whose barcodes aren‚Äôt recognized, but unfortunately that is most of what I eat.

Health is so haaaaard. I wish the magic app unicorn would make that better. Like. How hard is it to add baked chicken breast? But apparently, my options are limited to Stouffer's. And honestly.

I can‚Äôt send myself a password reset request because of the typo in the email I used. I‚Äôm still logged in to the iOS app, but with no way to change any of my login settings. It‚Äôs not a huge effort to make a new account and consider this a throwaway, but it‚Äôs a frustrating first experience that could have been avoided with either an email or password confirmation field, or the ability to change email or password via the iOS app.",Hi there.

I‚Äôve used MyFitnessPal and hated it right off the bat (ads and struggling to find certain foods). I‚Äôve also tried SparksPeople which at first was great and I lost 40 lbs with it. However now, it‚Äôs become ad city and for whatever reason, when I use the app, I severely reduce my calorie intake because I would have my macros ate at 1300 calories and that was maddening to see. With MyPlate, I don‚Äôt have those worries of MyFitnessPal or SparksPeople. The ads are exceedingly manageable compared to the other services and it gives you healthy recipes to try out based on the amount of calories you have left for the day. 10/10 I do recommend!",Thank you for the stellar review!!

I have them switched off and MyPlate still continues to send me at least 5 notifications ‚Äútrack your breakfast track your lunch please come back don‚Äôt for get this this and that blah blah blah.‚Äù It normally would not be a big issue because I could just go and disable them from Apple settings. I am just annoyed because why offer the feature if you‚Äôre still going to blow up my phone daily with notifications?? App is good otherwise. Nice UI and I love the nutritional breakdown.",Hey there!

When you scan the barcode, more often than not, the calories it shows on the app is more than what it shows on the nutrition tab on the box/bag. If you do workout, it‚Äôs impossible to put in what you lost unless you have one of those expensive smart watches that tells you all of that or you‚Äôre knowledgeable in fitness. I work on my feet all day, walking a lot so I know I do burn through calories, but am not sure how much I burn, so that adds to it being inaccurate. I recommend maybe preset exercises put in based off of the average amount people burn calories doing that workout/activity. May not be 100% accurate, but way more accurate than it is now.",Hi there! Thanks for the review and feedback. We do not recommend tracking your daily activities (e.g. work) in the app. These calories are accounted for when you select your Activity Level.

Some of its advice won‚Äôt fit every person‚Äôs body/needs (I *wish* I could eat that many calories and still lose weight!), but that‚Äôs just life. My only minor annoyance is that for a lot of the foods I eat, if you try to log them you‚Äôll get forty results with contradictory information... I generally  just give up and type in the info myself. But that‚Äôs not a big deal.","Hi dudemcmcdudestermeister! Thanks for your feedback!

I feel like food tracking is so much work though. I have to make a lot of meals because I cook a lot, but you have to figure up an individual serving. That‚Äôs kind of crazy. I cook for 4, so I know how much I use for a whole meal, but to break it down to 1? No. Also, I wish you could select multiple foods at once for meals. I find I skip logging my food because it‚Äôs so time consuming, and when I‚Äôm at work, or out to eat, I don‚Äôt want to take 10 minutes to log 1 meal. I don‚Äôt want to go back to my fitness pal, because I love this lay out so much, but I‚Äôve considered it specifically for the ease of logging food.",

At 59, I now dropped 22 pounds and wear a 34 waist down about 5‚Äù. Here is the problem I have experienced recently.  My walking calories are not registering which I really depend on. I had a problem with my iPhone 6+ when the tracking quit working.  I got a replacement from Apple but was surprised to see that the walking calories still are not sinking up even though I have enabled it in the settings. Thank you for this powerful app!",Hi Emerald! We're aware of this issue with the tracker and we're working on a fix. So sorry for the inconvenience but glad to hear that you've found such success so far!

One thing I found, is that there is no editing capability to remove an exercise. Normally a user would be able slide the unwanted item either left or right to delete it. Not so with MyPlate. If by accident, you add an exercise, that‚Äôs it, you‚Äôre locked in. I haven‚Äôt tried removing a food yet. The usability in general has become a bit wonky. The search feature tends to aggregate and sort items sometimes arbitrarily. I went to the Livestrong website and noticed a lot of opportunity for improvement there as well. It would be great to sit down with the dev and walk through usability improvements. The foundation is there it just needs to be polished.",
113,5,2019-03-23T17:23:04.000Z,My Two Cats,Great way to hold yourself accountable!,"Before I got this app, I used to try to mentally track my nutrition. However, I was far less successful than I have been using My Plate. I have lost about 25 pounds since downloading it. The coolest feature is the way you can scan a barcode from a food package and the nutritional info is automatically recorded. Most foods I‚Äôve scanned have been in the database, but it‚Äôs also easy to manually enter the info if needed.",

So I decided to try this one out, and it‚Äôs so much better. I love how it breaks everything down for you in terms of how much sodium and whatnot you‚Äôre eating, not just calories. And it allows you to track water intake as well without charging you to do so, Lose It requires you to go premium to do that. This app also connects rather seamlessly to the health app that comes on your iPhone, and gives you an idea of how many calories you‚Äôre burning instead of just saying ‚Äútake this many steps and get a calorie bonus‚Äù like Lose It does. I find this feature much more useful.",

After several messages back & forth (there is no phone number listed) I was told I can change the daily % but cannot adjust each individual goal. I wanted to set daily limits based on a keto plan but can‚Äôt. So at the end of the day I see I had 70% carbs 20% protein &10% fat. I wanted to see the adjusted breakdown 85 g carbs, 45 G protein, 30 g fat, 1600 sodium, 450 cholesterol, 10 g sugar, etc. why offer a means to change something if it doesn‚Äôt work.

However, I'm not tying to lose anything. So upgrading would be a waste. Overall, I know majority of people are focusing on losing weight but, for an app that pulled me in stating it can help me gain weight it is really lacking the features for my situation.

It was necessary for me to follow the Bariatric guidelines (3 meals/day, no snacks, 64 oz water, no simple carbs) prior to surgery and this app is perfect. Surgery was last year and I am down 72 lbs. My BP medication was cut in half, plus I had been taking 1500 mg of Metformin for Type II Diabetes for 14 years and now without taking that glucose regulating drug I am free of the disease.

Doesn‚Äôt directly track ‚Äúnet carbs‚Äù, although you can get to the information. The database lookup of foods is often wrong, especially for generic raw ingredients like unbranded spinach or onions.  Sometimes food quantity is listed as ‚Äú1 serving‚Äù and it‚Äôs hard, if not impossible, to tell what quantity that is. Adding a recipe is cumbersome and the data doesn‚Äôt always add correctly. Adding a ‚Äúnew food‚Äù often doesn‚Äôt correctly catch the info and cannot be edited - for example, I added a food with 12g of sugar, it listed as 0.12g sugar and it cannot be changed.",

I wish I could input my recipes in here without having to do all this math to figure out exactly what I ate. I cook for a family and I make a meal for a family and 90% of the time it‚Äôs from scratch. So I feel I should be able to put down all the ingredients in my meal into one place. Plug in how many servings it was and then have that saved to my meals with all the calories and info I need. It would be a better time saver then entering 30 ingredients every single time I eat pasta sauce. Instead of going through and saying I had 3 cups boiled Roma tomatoes and 1/4 of an onion and 2 cloves garlic and yada yada yada Every time  I want to ah I ate spaghetti sauce.,Thanks for the feedback and we're glad that you're loving the app!

Also I‚Äôm a bit confused about the way my calorie bar grows when I burn calories as if I should eat more to make up for it, but the breakdown doesn‚Äôt adjust to it. Is that just supposed to show my calorie deficit and I shouldn‚Äôt go above the goal? More coaching with the app would be a major improvement! Continuing my subscription because I like it better than other apps and in hopes improvements will be made.","Hi Natasha! Thank you for your review and feedback. The calories adjusted with your calories burned to maintain a consistent calorie deficit. If you do not consume the calories burned you will have a greater calorie deficit than your goal. Bear in mind, you should not be including extra calories for daily activities, only deliberate exercise."

When I scan something the app shows a different amount of calories than the item says on package. It‚Äôs close most of the time so I just make the adjustments but wish it was more accurate. But it‚Äôs not that big of a deal but makes me wonder when I don‚Äôt have it to scan is it correct? And then I wonder if my counting is way off?

These ads are annoying, I don‚Äôt think paying $9.99 a month is worth it, especially when I‚Äôm not looking for any other features.

Previously weight was tracked with a line graph on a much smaller range making it easy to see how I was doing.

To be fair, it does seem to calculate calories correctly, If you can find the food you‚Äôre consuming and it‚Äôs database. But if you‚Äôre looking to track grams of proteins, carbohydrates, fats then this is not a good program to use.  Worse than the above, when customer services contacted about this flaw all that is given is excuses!  Weeks of excuses. This is not a terribly difficult problem to resolve. But it seems as though the developers intent is to rope in as many paid customers as they can rather than build the best application they can. My suggestion? Use a different application. There are many that are much better.","Thank you for your review. We've been in communication with you on this issue, and we're sorry that we haven't been able to resolve this yet.

Simply providing a Delete function is not by any means a real Edit Capability. Putting these issues aside, it a good app and the web site is an excellent bonus with valuable health/fitness information.

Plus it gives you guidance in meals, you just set it in what you eat ( what I mean by that is if you eat any animal products or your a vegetarian or vegan. Also you can sign up for their exercise programs answer some questions about yourself they send you exercise videos that would fit you. You don‚Äôt feel alone in what you are working towards.

At 6-1, that‚Äôs kinda heavy, especially if I want to keep up with my buddies on mountain bikes. Talking to people and reading, I figured out that it doesn‚Äôt matter how hard you work out, if you‚Äôre exceeding your calorie output with your input. Time for a change.

If you struggle with overeating and want something to help keep you accountable with your calorie and nutrition intake, this is the app for you!

It has the widest variety of food. Another big advantage is the adding a recipe (must be done on the site) or adding a recipe to ‚Äúmy meals‚Äù on the app make it easier to get more accurate calorie/nutrient breakdowns of the food you cook at home without having to re-enter all the ingredients in a recipe every time you eat the leftovers or cook that meal.

This app is, hands down, the best app I have ever used. With a weekly grocery list emailed to you weekly, and your meal recipes emailed you to daily, you don‚Äôt even have to think about tracking food. It‚Äôs literally like having a nutritionist completing all your planning for you. And I super appreciate the vegetarian recipes, which are all amazing. My biggest down fall has always been coming home from work to a bare fridge and  feeling exhausted. Then I binge on crappy food.  Now I don‚Äôt. With a bit of meal prepping, I have everything I need. This app is amazing!!!",Hi there! Thanks for the review. It's exciting to hear how well the app is working for you.

I ate the easy to make meals on the meal plan and did the workouts that were recommended. I lost about 1 pound a week. It has now been 6 months since I first started and I have surpassed my goal and lost 30 lbs and I feel great!  Everyone comments on how good I look and ask me how I did it. I tell them I am using this app.  This is a healthy way to lose weight and I highly recommend it.,

For example, some foods just have ‚Äú1 serving‚Äù as the amount. How much is a serving? It doesn‚Äôt say. Some foods have ‚Äú1 serving (3 ounces)‚Äù which is great that the serving size is quantified, but I find it odd that my only other denomination for amounts are either in pounds or grams.

I also loved how it made me more conscious of what I was eating, so in a way it also helped me choose healthier options. But after barely a month, it started to get really buggy. Adding a food became a challenge, I would repeatedly get told that my request timed out or the data wasn‚Äôt in the correct format. So if I wanted to be tracking my food, I could only track foods I had already added. This was especially annoying because I‚Äôm a person who loves to try new foods and I just couldn‚Äôt track them.

Thank you to anyone who made it! However, since I got the Apple Watch things got a little annoying. The app, for some reason, gets info about the calories I burned from my watch AND my phone. In most cases, I have them both with me, so it dramatically overcounts (usually almost x2). Deleting exercise proved useless (as it just pops back up in 2 seconds) and I cannot find a way to ‚Äúunsync‚Äù just my phone from the app.","Hello! We apologize for the double counting. Our team is aware of this and is working on a solution. In the meantime, we recommend turning off activity tracking in the MyPlate app. This will allow the app to sync only with your Apple Watch.

The lowest is 1/4, and other competing apps go down to 1/8 serving. Also, when creating a meal, I‚Äôd like to be able to divide that into serving sizes. Right now you just add food to the meal and it gives you the total calories for the ENTIRE meal rather than letting you divide it into servings. Laatly, when creating a new food, I‚Äôd love it if I could add saturated fat, sugar, sodium, and fiber instead of just macros. If these things were added I‚Äôd definitely give it 5 stars!",

I find that this app is the most reliable source when it comes to finding foods that you don‚Äôt have a barcode to scan for (restaurant meals, drinks, etc.). I also like the ‚Äúcreate my food‚Äù section. That saves a lot of time when you make your own foods. One click and your done, vs adding each time individually. **I am on the KETO diet, so if you are on the same diet (or LCHF), this is the app for you!**",

I had lost 15lbs due to a bad reaction to medication and I needed to gain it back. This is the only app that has an option for weight gain. The scanner is a great way to get exact nutrient values. Most foods can be found already preloaded in the app! This app is absolutely amazing! The only thing that isn‚Äôt perfect is that it‚Äôs difficult to track calories burned unless you have an Apple Watch. Amazing app tho",

The only thing, however, is that there is no option for being pregnant. I feel that this app would be over the top fantastic if there were an option on how to eat during pregnancy based on my specific body. Overall, wonderful app though.",

I find the best way to lose those lbs is to track everything I eat.

The only thing I am not a fan of is when putting in exercise instead saying how many miles you walked that do you just put in hours which to me is not the most accurate thing to a person if they had been walking around a bit during different moments of the day.

Sometimes a food that is logged would give a portion size of say 21 pieces but you only have 6 of it. It won‚Äôt log what that amount would be in calories.

So this makes the calories burned incorrect. It‚Äôs actually doubling my burned calories.

Other than that, I love the app!","Thanks for trying MyPlate, and thanks for the comments! Our team is aware of this and is currently working on a solution.

First off, when you add in your weight for the day, it changes the amount of calories needed for all days, including past recorded days. This makes it difficult to look back and reflect on how you‚Äôve progressed and such. Second off, I don‚Äôt know if this is in gold, but if it‚Äôs not, could you add in some sort of way to watch vitamins, minerals, fruits, and vegetables or something along those lines?

However, after a year of using it, the barcode scanner stopped picking up food items. It would no longer scan items no matter how many times I tried with different methods. I‚Äôm not sure if the app is at fault or if I did something, or maybe it‚Äôs even my phone camera. Either way, 4 stars for a good overall app",Hi Tommy! If you are using a newer iPhone the barcode scanner is centered differently than previous iPhones models. You will need to move the device slightly up when scanning. This should place the line of the bottom scanning window right on the barcode. Doing so will yield better results.

I‚Äôve searched high and low for one!  It would be great if you can add a Notes section. I‚Äôm diabetic and would love to store my blood glucose reading in your app. Also it crashes sometimes when I try to make a new meal.,

If you‚Äôre trying to gain weight or lose weight, this is your app. They do offer a paid version but the only reason I haven‚Äôt upgraded is because it doesn‚Äôt sync with my Fitbit.

I have a Fitbit so my Fitbit keeps track of everything and I don‚Äôt use my Health app or anything to keep track of my steps. I was just wondering how do you connect the Fitbit app to MyPlate to have all the information. If you can‚Äôt, I understand. This is a great app.","Hi mbaaydjf! We're glad you are enjoying the app. Unfortunately, at this time, FitBit integration is not an available feature. Currently the MyPlate app can sync with Apple's Health app. If you have your FitBit synced to the Health app your activity can be logged that way. To sync MyPlate with your mobile device's health app, be sure to tap the button on the MyPlate app's home screen that asks you to connect with Apple Health. If you do not see the button on the home screen of the MyPlate app that asks you to sync with the Health app, please log out and back into your account. Doing this will force MyPlate to serve you with this option again."

The one flaw is that I can‚Äôt view breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack statistics separately. I count carbs because I‚Äôm a diabetic, and it would be very helpful to view meals separately instead of lumped all together for the day.

Thanks for reaching out. We very much appreciate your feedback and I have passed along your comments to our product development team. MyPlate uses a comprehensive third-party food database, which is a collection of listings from the USDA and some food manufacturers. Unfortunately, we're not able to add or remove items from this database as it is managed by Nutritionix. If the item you'd like to track is not in our database, we recommend creating a custom food entry in the app. If you have any questions/comments we're happy to assist you.

I eat a lot of the same foods each day, and for me, it‚Äôs so easy to make duplicate entries. Very logically set up. Very easy to locate foods in the database. Definitely a 5-star app.  Thank you.",

796,3,2020-02-06T03:54:38.000Z,laura.j12,Basic calorie counting app,"Good for beginners learning to record food log; however not advanced enough for macronutrient counting. You can‚Äôt specify exact macros by gram, only by percentage. Also you can‚Äôt log food by as precisely as MFP does. My plate logs by serving size-2 1/2 pancakes-but you really need to know how many ounces or grams of batter goes into 2.5 cupcakes to be exact. Room for improvement but basic functions are present.",

I would be looking at the nutrition facts on the label and the app is telling me all different numbers. Also when you search something basic to track it brings up such random items! I was trying to track a plum (like a real plum, a piece of fruit, actually food) and I had to scroll through multiple plum flavored drinks and snacks before I could find it. It should be the other way around.","Hello! We apologize for the frustration. MyPlate uses a third party food database called Nutritionix.

Other than that üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ,Hi there! Thanks for the review and feedback. Our team is aware of an issue with grams and other measurement units not being displayed as a serving size option. The team is working on a fix for this issue. If you have additional feedback we encourage you to reach out to us at support@livestrong.com.
1037,1,2020-06-13T01:52:36.000Z,kimberlybrookeeee,Censorship,This app censors content and stifles human discussion. It deleted my comments in the community about eating less than their algorithms recommendation. If they want to include a section in the app for people to offer advice to other people then it shouldn‚Äôt be censored or regulated. As an American I can only support organizations that practice relentless free speech. This app is not qualified to decide what can be considered ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù advice. Either allow people to speak freely or remove that feature on the app entirely.,"Hi there. Our Community Guidelines state that we will not allow promotion of unsafe methods. Our app does not allow calorie goals lower than 1,200 per day, as this is widely considered the lowest amount of calories a person can safely eat without consulting a doctor. Therefore we uphold this rule in the community for the safety of anyone who is not able to consult with a doctor. We wish you the very best on your journey!"

For safety reasons, 1200 calories per day is the minimum caloric goal allowed by the MyPlate calculator.

1308,5,2019-06-24T15:50:28.000Z,JessLeaOs,Helpful & Easy!,This app is great even for beginners like me. I find it very easy to use and I like that it gives me ideas for workouts. I use it with my FlagFit 2.0 app to track my calories burned.,
1309,3,2019-09-17T21:39:56.000Z,annacat097,Fitness tracking,Under activity diary it says iPhone daily steps calories and my Apple Watch calories. Is this double counting the calories I am burning?

Our team is aware of the double counting and is working on a solution. In the meantime, we recommend turning off activity tracking in the MyPlate app. This will allow the app to sync only with your Apple Watch. To do this, please do the following:"

1321,1,2017-12-19T15:14:51.000Z,Justkeepswimming2u,Maintaining is Not an Option,I recently downloaded the app and was disappointed to only see an option from losing or gaining weight. I was looking for a tracker that would be able to tell me that I could maintain my current image. I guess I‚Äôll have to install a different application.

For safety reasons, 1200 calories per day is the minimum caloric goal allowed by the MyPlate calculator. This is commonly considered the lowest number of calories a person can eat in a day without doctor supervision. Since most of our users do not check with a doctor before taking on such a goal, or are unable to do, we implemented this as a safety feature.

We understand the demand for a nursing option with the calorie tracker. Currently there is not a standardized formula for calculating calories burned for a nursing mother as there are many factors that go into the calculation: mother‚Äôs weight, age, activity level and the age of the baby. We recommend consulting with your doctor about how many calories you are burning through breast feeding and then tracking them as Manual Calories burned."

I do have to say that I am disappointed in the scans sometimes because the information that it brings up doesn‚Äôt match the information on the food package. Fortunately, it doesn‚Äôt happen often.",

2875,3,2019-01-18T20:06:09.000Z,Myschultz,Almost there,"I‚Äôve been tracking myself with this app for just about a month and have paid for the membership. Overall, I‚Äôm happy with it. It is an easy way to keep an accurate picture of what‚Äôs going on - once you‚Äôve gone through an initial break-in period. If you are like me, even if you eat a variety of foods, there is still a core menu of things you consume on a regular basis. I was on vacation from work for the first week or so of tracking so I had plenty of time to find an input items in my regular diet. The app allows you to input foods that aren‚Äôt in its database under the ‚ÄúMy Foods‚Äù category and to create custom meals or groupings of food as well. Adding custom foods is fairly easy if you have a product label on hand. I wish that function had a separate ‚Äúbrand‚Äù field so you didn‚Äôt have to try and include it in the item name. I‚Äôd also like there to be a field to track added sugar in nutrition values. Although, not all labels separate that out, so I get it. I found the ‚ÄúMy Meals‚Äù option more cumbersome. In order to create a meal, you have to start from scratch with your food entry. It would be nice to have a repopulated list of items we‚Äôve logged before to start with. And, once in a meal, can you edit case by case? If I eat my normal salad, but switch to a dressing with a different nutrient profile, I can‚Äôt just make a one-time change. Also, I found branded foods listed as ‚Äúverified‚Äù under multiple slightly different names and nutrient profiles. All of these suggestions are small in the grand scheme. It has helped me get a very realistic view of my portions, amounts, and macronutrient balances. A month in, I‚Äôm still leaning. I just realized, for example, that I can adjust my own macronutrient goals under my profile information.",

I love the layout of it and how things sync together, but I do have a number of gripes with it, too, one of which has caused me to request that my account be deleted. 1. Many of the calorie counts are not accurate on it, and they have been wrong for more than a year now. There is not an option to change any of them either. 2. The BIG ONE, which caused me to request that my account be deleted. The recipe builder is messed up when you go to their website and try to use it, and has been for over a year. It will allow you to go all the way through it, adding all of your ingredients, the instructions on how to fix it, and let‚Äôs you get to part where you click on ‚ÄúCreat Recipe.‚Äù Once you do this, nothing happens, and your recipe is not saved. I have reached out to MyPlate about it last year when it first happened, and last night when it happened again, and they still haven‚Äôt fixed this issue IN OVER A YEAR! Their suggestion is to add all of the ingredients and portion it out as a meal, which is very frustrating to say the least because you can‚Äôt just enter the stuff and tell it that you ate this many servings of it like you would the recipe builder. If you enter it there and you eat more or less the next time, you would have to go back in there each time and change the ingredients and the servings of each ingredient to get the calorie count correct. The main thing that is so frustrating is, I understand that things can happen with technology and it may take some time to get the bugs worked out of it, but it has been over a year, and they still haven‚Äôt fixed something as important as the recipe builder.","Hi there!

With this release you enter items you ate and then they disappear and are not displayed as eaten although their calorie counts are in the totals. You thus cannot see or edit all the items you actually ate and the total calorie counts don‚Äôt agree with what is displayed as eaten. The basic functionality of this app is to actually track what you ate and total the calories, carbs, proteins, etc. It is broken and can no longer do this. Thus it went from wonderful to totally worthless. What kind of test and quality control organization could have possibly let this release go to production with such an obvious flaw that made the program hopelessly unusable?","Hello!

3220,4,2013-01-18T03:45:13.000Z,TinaW249,So wonderful & easy to use!!,"I've been using My Plate Tracker for 2 weeks now & I absolutely love this app! I've downloaded others in the past & never really used them much but with the ease of My Plate, you honestly can't go wrong since there is a HUGE database of foods already in there! I lost 2.5 lbs & 2 inches my first week using this app! There is place to set up reminders in case u haven't tracked yet (but I've noticed it only works if you've not tracked @ all that day) but feel it would be helpful to add a second reminder in there in case u have missing meals...ie....forgot to track dinner, etc. I also noticed that, as far as I can tell, u can only track for that particular day ONLY on that specific day, which is a bit annoying if by chance I've forgotten or have gotten too busy to track my dinner meal. Poof, then, that dinner meal may as well have never been eaten according to the tracker. The only other thing is I don't particularly care for the bonus stuff but maybe others prefer it & it is helpful to them to help achieve their goals? Who knows, but it is of no consequence to me. But be aware u don't have to participate if u don't care to, which I love that!!! All in all, this app is wonderful & I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to lose weight & make a healthy lifestyle change!!!",

Much healthier for me & make it easier to do everyday things, including mounting my horses, amazing how hard it is to pull this extra weight up that far, especially since I got a new one that's taller than my head at her back! This all has led to my inspiration to track & lose weight to be healthier!  This app is wonderful & inspiring as I walk around seeing my calories melt as my iPhone tracks me, then I put in my bathroom I just cleaned and wow, I'm negative calories right now!  Almost lunch time so I'll scan or punch what I eat in and drink (water is such nice with its own button!) My dr is gonna love me next month! Maybe I'll break down & go buy a scale to track my weight now! This really let's you see the breakdown and makes it simple to see your protein to carbs ratio too! It's been rainy here the last few days since I loaded this & off work for weekend/holiday can't wait to see what I do on normal days at work & weekends on the farm! I imported this data to my iPhone health app as well to show with my daily mileage and pedometer count! So freaking awesome! So far for a week every day average is 2 miles a day just going about work & chores no exercise getting ready to implement that in!  Everyone Good Luck on your journey!",
3222,3,2016-01-10T14:08:24.000Z,2NickPick,"Loved it, but didn't work for me :/","Honestly, I want to give this baby 4-5 stars! I love how not only can you track food, exercise, and weight; but also water. The water section is great because it allows you to select your container size before logging giving you a better idea of how much water you consumed. I loved that you could review your macros and you could read the newest research in health. I loved the design and the usability. There was one flaw that was a deal breaker for me. I cook for my family and as such I'm typically making meals that serve 4-6. Therefore, I found it very difficult logging my food, because as far as I can tell, there is no recipe function. It has a custom food input so if you know the info for your recipes individual serving you can create it, but for me that isn't easy. I would have to log in the full recipe into meals, divide the nutritional facts that it shows down to 1 in my calculator. Then I'd delete the meal and save it in my custom foods. So much work. No thanks!! I have seen other apps where you can log the full recipe, say how much it serves and it will divide it down per serving for you. If you cook for a single person or  have no problem doing the  work then I would suggest this app because otherwise it's fantastic. If you are like me and need to be able to log full recipes,  I wouldn't recommend this.",
3223,1,2017-04-08T04:26:59.000Z,Haley Gascho,Many issues with this app,"I've used this app on and off the last few years but recent dieting and exercise prompted me to start using it again. Initially it is a good app for tracking and logging your calories and carbs. But it doesn't let you select any less than 100% of your daily nutritional goals. When you're dieting, that's kind of what you're going for. Aside from that, the ""community"" page is a COMPLETE JOKE. You literally can not post anything without people trolling your posts and harassing you. When I spoke up about those internet trolls who literally did nothing but criticize you and insults your intelligence and say awful things, THEY reported my comments and had all my posts removed. Yet I still haven't figured out how to delete a comment or report one? I'm 20 it's not like in some old person who doesn't understand technology. They just have those options hidden very well I guess. Not only that, but when you go to log an exercise for the day, they have VERY limited information on most workouts and their calories burned. Aside from this their latest update made the app harder to figure out and more work than its worth with a lot of unnecessary clicking.",

3230,3,2015-01-11T21:44:49.000Z,Pallavi y,Great app but some annoying things,"I really like this app more than other trackers because it feels more inclusive than most but there are a few things that are really irritating. First, when trying to add a food I frequently get a message saying ""sorry we are unable to add a food at this time. Please try again later."" I don't know what that's about or why it happens - it's completely random, sporadic and annoying. Second, when doing a quick add, you can't add essential items like sodium or fiber but it's often the only option I have when I keep getting the above message and can't add it the other way. Third, it automatically deducts your activity calories burned from the amount you ate. I wish there were an option so that I could track my activity without having it subtract that amount from what I ate - I still ate that much. Just because I did a lot of activity shouldn't give me license to eat a whole bunch more. That's not how weight loss works. Lastly, I wish I could set my own carbohydrate limit instead of theirs which just seems arbitrary and excessive. Would love this app and give it 5 stars if these things got fixed.",
3231,5,2015-04-02T04:21:17.000Z,Miss Reviewer911,It depends on YOU! Do the WORK!,"I lost 70 lbs with the online version of this app years ago. Now I'm more on the go and not to add gained all my weight back and some. The LiveStrong app is really convenient. This application allows for users to track their calorie intake, (especially important for those seeking to loose weight), water, weight, bmi, etc. If I had to give constructive criticism on this app I would say that the daily water intake doesn't allow for mistakes to be corrected. I accidentally put in that I drank 824 oz of water and  there was no way of changing it.  The reminders that you can set for this app also comes in handy. Not to mention the food library is amazing. You can even scan items.  Most other apps like this one you have to manually enter a lot of foods you eat. LiveStrong has almost everything in its food tracker, everything down to 5 star restaurants to the local burger joint, and fresh fruits and vegetables. I recommend this app to make a long story short. It could improve in certain areas but what doesn't need improvements these day. üòä",
3232,4,2016-02-04T14:13:00.000Z,Jupiterinthebarn,Superb w/a couple fixes,"This app is great. It's the only app I've found that suits my specific needs. One issue that I have is that the calories section for exercise has a glitch that recently appeared. I have noticed that it often does not change calorie amount between a 10+ minute record of exercise and sometimes it's completely off. This use to work just fine. I only use the manual food option to record my food consumption. I would really like to see an option to delete previous amounts recorded (such as manual food 24 or 194). This list of past recordings is too long and then I can't locate the ones I use more frequently. That being said, this app is awesome. I have lost over a hundred lbs in the past two years through exercise and watching my calories. This has app has contributed to my success by giving me a place to record exercise and providing me with a guideline to follow for calories. Also, it keeps track of my weight. I continue to use this app for maintenance. This app appeals to people with many types of needs which makes it all the better.",
3233,3,2016-04-08T03:45:31.000Z,Tab1114,Looks nice,"I recently purchased an Apple Watch after using a Fitbit flex for over a year. I wanted to track more of my fitness and I thought the Apple Watch would be the smartest upgrade to make. I have been searching high and low for an all-in-one app like Fitbit has. I thought MyPlate was finally the one. It looks nice and is easy to figure out, everything syncs as it should, but I'm not happy with the food library. Today I wanted to log a tomato. I could not find a regular tomato! There were canned tomatoes and stewed tomatoes and green tomatoes. But not a regular, raw, sliced tomato! There is only one listed as a user submission and it says one serving (what is the serving?!) and zero calories. Ok. And why don't they list what a serving is and why can't I change the type of serving- say tablespoon or teaspoon as opposed to ounces? And when you choose the amount you have, it should update the serving size. For example: when logging chicken a serving is 3oz. When I choose a serving (1, 1 1/2, etc) it should update the size of the serving.  When I see this change, I will definitely upgrade to the subscription app. Please make this more user friendly and add a friggin tomato!",
3234,4,2016-10-07T18:24:18.000Z,Petuniabishco,Pretty Good,"This app is pretty good overall - easy to use, has a pretty big database, and it's easy to add items that aren't already in there. I like that it's easy to track my water intake, too.",
3235,4,2017-01-03T18:20:19.000Z,tlc55,"Like It, however....","I discovered I gained 20 Lb. since I starting using Fitness Pal 2 years ago.  There are many reasons for this. I decided to try something else. For it to be effective for me, the app has to be fun to use, have a nice interface, and be easy to track foods eaten & exercise done. I love the interface on this app. It's very simple and clean & I like the plate idea.  I would like to see fiber listed as well as protein, carbs, calories & fat. I'm finding it won't scan some of the foods I have eaten. It doesn't seem to be able to scan if it's not a well known brand. However it did have Chipotle barbacoa bowl in there.   So I like it, but if it's consistently too difficult to enter my foods, I probably won't keep using it.",
3236,4,2017-02-01T03:09:45.000Z,Deena330,"Pregnant and love the app, but...","After using this app religiously for two weeks, I have to say I love almost everything about it. I'm pregnant so needed an app that would allow me to set a goal of gaining a 1/2 pound a week. Perfect! Interface is super easy, creating new food is easy, and I've found it very helpful in being mindful of what I'm eating. I'd love to sign up for the year plan, and that's where the rub comes in. I'm all about paying for premium content, and am absolutely willing to shell out $45 to get access to it for a year. But please don't ""auto renew"" me unless I cancel one day before! That feels like such a trick. ""Oops you forgot to cancel - that will be another $45 for a year"". If the content is valuable and worth it, we will agree to another year/$45. And if not, we won't. But don't try to ""hook"" us. Final thought - not sure why but the exercises you can select from are super strange! Like they don't have CrossFit (perhaps the most popular fitness routine today) but they bartending.  ?! Next time I bartend I will know how many calories I burned. But no Barre class, crossfit, etc. flying is in there though so if you do a lot of flying you are in luck!",
3237,1,2017-03-23T19:04:28.000Z,Thefirelion,Such potential wasted.,"First the good. This app looks good, user interface is crisp and clean and intuitive to use. The list of foods is complete and specific, all that myfitday app isn't. It's specific with brand names of foods and brings up very relevant products when searching, all that myfitday can never seem to get right. The user experience is way better than MFP so that's also a big positive. That said, This app had every opportunity to be what my fitness pal could not/would not, but missed it's chance. Mainly, these free apps aren't useable in the sense that they provide just enough info to make it work but barely. They get you hooked so the idea/frustration of starting over with another app gets you to give in and pay. This app won't even show you your exact total daily macros, you have to upgrade to a monthly payment level to see that. Really?  The whole point of these apps is to know your daily macro totals and you shouldn't have to pay for that basic bit of info.  I've grown tired of all these fitness apps claiming to be free but to actually use them correctly/effectively you really need to upgrade to the super duper gold level package for 10-20 bucks a month. Can't someone just make a simple flippin app that lets you enter your food, set your macro %'S and see what they are at the end of the day without it looking like a nerd or a 12 year old girl made?  Geesh.",Hi Thefirelion- thanks for your feedback! We just wanted to make sure you know that the free version of the app does allow you to view your total daily macros!

3238,3,2017-04-07T20:50:51.000Z,FHIII,"Easy to Use, Pleasing to the Eye, 3/4 of What I Need","I just started using a calorie tracking app this week as I begin a ketogenic diet. Downloaded numerous apps and started several only to find them unintuitive, very limited in what they offer ($$ for what is actually helpful), and not as tailored to a low-carb diet. So far the scan feature has been great and relatively accurate to packaging. As easy or more so than most to build food and meal data. The UI is motivating and the linkage to the iOS health app is convenient. Now for the demotion to three stars: I need to track net carbs in my macronutrients rather than total carbs. This is not an option as far as I've found in MyPlate (apparently not even in the upgrade) so those nice, slick graphs look good but are completely inaccurate. To be fair no free app for iOS seems to offer this but that is where MyPlate has an opportunity to set itself apart. MyFitnessPal appears to offer a free option for accessing this information but not on the mobile app (a script edit on the desktop app). Entering info on the iOS app should allow me to sync to the desktop and convert the data. I'll most likely try that option but would prefer the MyPlate UI. Please make my life simpler and more accurately informed by adding a ""net carbs"" option to the macro data.",
3239,3,2017-09-01T13:13:38.000Z,StellarAlchemy777,Okay,"I initially tried using MyFitnessPal, but it wouldn't accept my ""macros"" and seemed generally uncooperative (though it was great when I used it before, a few years ago). So I tried this instead. I've been using it for about a month, and I find it tedious and annoying. Which is especially disappointing considering its one job is to remove the tedium and difficulty from tracking your nutrition.",Hi StellarAlchemy777. Thank you for your feedback and review!

I lost over 100 pounds several years ago with careful portioning and living a heart-healthy lifestyle. I have kept the weight off for over 6 years, but this past winter I put on about 5 pounds. I knew I needed to track my food carefully to see where I was adding extra calories and this app has helped so much! I was eating a few too many servings of healthy fats such as nuts and seeds I realized after tracking carefully. Now I am using the app to help me visually plan my daily meal plan instead of in my journal as I had previously. I am creating a calorie deficiency to cause a weight loss by carefully watching my portions and limiting my healthy fats more than I was. This has already caused me to drop the excess pounds over just 2 weeks! This is a wonderful tool. I wish I had it years ago when I started journaling on my journey to losing over 100 pounds, it would have saved me so much time vs. writing everything down and then looking up calories!

It is really easy and streamlined to use, which is my main requirement for any app. Food choices are perfect for foods a person would find in the States, though I wish I could find more approximations for exotic and foreign dishes that we cook at home. I never used to count calories regularly because of the dedication it took- logging on, researching, recording, adding, subtracting from limits, etc. iPhone + this app= no reason to go over calorie limits. Hard to be that lazy! Note- I wish there was a way to add onto yesterday's info without having to do the dance of going to diary, yesterday, +, meals/exercise. If there was a way to just flip back to that on the main page where i add on to today's cals, and have the same easy page setup as that, that would be great, especially since I often don't log dinner until after midnight.",

3243,3,2014-08-09T21:14:40.000Z,Uhl33s,Useful but not accurate,"- I use this app every day because I like most of the design, but with discretion because I know it is not accurate unless you're careful. It lists different calories burned for the exact same activities, and only one of them is correct. E.g., for my height&weight, bicycling 12-14mph is listed as both 743cal/hour AND 562cal/hour. The 2nd one is accurate. Similarly, running 6mph is listed 930cal/hour AND 703. Again, only 2nd comes close. If I was basing my intake off of the first one, that wouldn't work out too well.",

The caloric intake for my height and weight loss goal is spot on. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm limiting myself or starving myself in order to meet the goal. I like how it tracks my steps and deducts calories burned. The database of food is huge and I can always find the food that I am looking for. I like how it tracks what I ate in recent days so that if I have a salad again, I don‚Äôt have to search for individual ingredients again. I have two problems though. The first is that I wish there was a notes section. I‚Äôm trying to track what I eat to see what bothers my stomach, and it‚Äôs hard to see how I felt that day when I can‚Äôt write it down. I also wish the workout section has more options. I am doing workouts that don‚Äôt tell me how many calories I burn, so it‚Äôs hard to track that movement. I wish I can say that I went running for an hour and it can calculate how much I burned.",

Documenting your meals, and being able to keep track of calories, makes everything feel that much more official. It REALLY discourages quitting. Uber user-friendly; if you're not sure which item to choose for your food, simply scan the barcode and voil√†! Everything about this app is extremely useful. I even recommend the water app that is linked to it (MyWater) to keep track of daily water intake as well. MyPlate even has a neat little chart to visually represent your activity throughout days, weeks, and months. Last but not least, it links to the pre-installed Health app on iPhone and uses that information to determine how many calories you have burned, not to mention that you can manually add exercises you have done to add to the calorie burning. For anyone wishing to live a healthier lifestyle, this app is IT!!!",

But doesn't do much good with the % off to the side. Need to see them in relevance to pie chart. Also move the health tool button to the bottom or something. Relevant info should be at the top.

3248,1,2017-07-18T13:50:29.000Z,ElaineAntonLotruglio,MyPlate,"This app is the worst I have used of all fitness apps. To log your exercises, you practically have to create all of them yourself. The are almost no stored exercises inputed by the app creators. For example a burp -- everyone in fitness kows what a burpee is! Only, if you search for a burp in the app there are no matches. This is true with SO many basic fitness exercises. In another example, lets say you have done 50 squats -- the only option in recording this exercise is squats per hour. No one does squats straight for one hour -- which by the way the app says is just 133 calories burned -- completely impossible that if someone did squats for one hour straight he/she would only burn 133 calories! In a more likely scenario someone may do a number value of squats like 50 for example yet with this app you'd have to just guess on calories burned or look it up on the web which adds a whole other step to recording your exercise. The user will run into all of these same issues with food and calorie content. Oftentimes I would have to look something up online and then put it into the app. I would pretty much have to create my food record and calorie intake and then put it into the app. Complete hassle!","Hi Elaine, thank you for your feedback.

At first I loved it, but by week three I was tiring on having to retype in food items in order to find them despite the recently eaten or frequently eaten tab. I found that recently eaten tab only brings up foods in the category you are recording, for instance if I recorded a fruit in breakfast it won't show up under the recently eaten tab when I am recording lunch. In addition several times I have had the system list no matches when searching for food items while connected to phone carrier network as opposed to using the wiifi on my iPad.  Finally like that I can see daily breakdown of my caloric intake but wish I could use this feature when I scroll back to look at other days in order to trend my calorie types. It would be nice to see if I have improved my percentage protein intake over the days recorded. Am going to try some other calorie tracking apps this next month to see if I find anything better to use.",

Adding what I eat is quick, one thumb nav. What I love is seeing how many carbs, protein and fat grams for meals before I eat them as well as throughout day if my carbs are high I can choose to eat more protein and know to skip the bread in order to balance out the whole day. One thing the free app earns you ten reward points every time you use a daily feature like adding a food item. At first the notices annoyed me but then I realized all those points add up to cash gift cards. So now it fun to count my calories, earn reward points and can you imagine my new me Xmas pics to all my friends next year when I have lost all this weight and using my reward points to go on vacation?

I was exercising and eating nutritious foods for the most part, but still wasn't losing weight. That's when I got back to the basics and started using this app to determine calories in and calories out.  I was able to set a weight goal and am working towards it. I have had great results, and I feel like this is something I can do.  I plan to use it daily for a month until I use a few pounds and then adjust the calories for the next month to maintain.  I do not plan on using it daily long term.  I think it is helpful to bring attention to how many calories one is eating comparatively.  I like that it breaks it breaks down the intake of macronutrients, but I wish that it also showed micronutrients consumed.  Overall, it is a great tool to use.",

I actually like it more than myfitness pal (but I'm biased to prettier apps), but there's a couple things that this app needs to work on. The scanner for some reason has a hard time focusing in on the barcode whenever I need to use my camera. It takes 3 times longer compared to other apps. Also, as of lately I've been having a REALLY hard time staying logged on and it's been driving me crazy. Whenever I close out of the app and then open the app to log in something, I will have to sign back in--but then nothing I tracked stays logged so I have to re-imput everything back in. I don't know why it keeps logging me out and keeps reading me as a new member (it keeps showing me the demo of how to do things), and I think it all happened after I downloaded the new update. Currently waiting for the new update.. I hope this gets fixed SOON so I can give this app the rating it deserves.",

I decided to get curious, however, and look into upgrading to a Gold account. This was the first time I was ever displeased with this app and my issue was because of ethics rather than functionality. They tell you how much a Gold Account is per month and when you press ""buy"" they try to hit your account for the whole year's fees when it is clearly implied that you will be paying a small amount monthly. Not a huge deal. It was still a good price. I just cannot stand trickery and dishonesty. Why not just say that a Gold account costs so much per year? Or, if you're going to quote it by the month, charge that quoted fee monthly? Anyway, I'm still happy with the app and may upgrade to Gold soon despite my being put off by the company's unethical procedure in that regard.",

For example, the nutrients it tracks. It only follows the protein, fat, and carbs although there are other nutrients that are just as important and should be included in the pie chart. It would be very beneficial if it also tracked the total number of cholesterol, sodium, dietary fiber and/or sugars as well. And maybe let the user individualize what they want to track in the daily pie chart. That would be amazing! Considering people may have to monitor certain nutrients in order to maintain their health (Like a heart attack survivor would have to monitor their cholesterol and sodium).",

There is a free version of the app, and a ""gold"" version that you pay for. I have the free version, and it includes all the features and functions I need/want. This is a vast improvement from a different app I tied, which marketed itself as free, yet didn't let you even enter meals without paying for the ""pro"" version. MyPlate is very easy to use, and you can customize your daily calorie, macronutrient (carbs, protein, fat), sodium, cholesterol, sugar, and dietary fiber goals. You can also set these to automatic, and it calculates daily goals based on height, weight, activity level, long-term goal (gain, lose, or maintain weight), and other factors. Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a free, comprehensive nutrition tracker with a great community you can go to for help and support.",

If you need something to help you keep an eye on all of these things, this is your app! The only ""con"" is that although the data available for common foods is great, you might not find exactly what you are and have to enter the information manually. A great way to do this is to just split up your meal and enter the items individually (e.g. Cooked vegetables, cooked shrimp, rice, and sauce - as opposed to looking for ""steamed vegetables with shrimp""). My favorite thing about this app is that you can go back and look at the previous days, add things, in case you forgot something, or simply see what you did that day to evaluate your progress along the way. I also love that you can track your exercise at the same time!",
3261,5,2013-05-21T21:12:44.000Z,Icesk8mama,Exercise,"Good and helpful. It is hard to realize what your calorie intake should be,but changing keeps you on track. I really like it doesn't cost and basically it does the same as weight watchers. It is hard work dieting but I like the fact I can still eat the things I like without going overboard. I am tired of the roller coaster ride of dieting at my age and once I get to my target weight all I will do is maintain it so I don't go crazy again. I like the rewards you can get from all the sponsor and that gives me an extra incentive to work at it harder. I have also learn to make time to walk even if I am tired at the end of the day. Not to thrilled about drinking water all the time but I do add tea once in awhile and it does take off on my calorie intake. All exercises are not listed but that can be dealt with by finding close to what you do.",

I am morbidly obese and need to make a drastic change immediately so we went looking for something like this, I described exactly what I needed to my friend and he found this app first on the list. I cannot believe how easy it is! You can look up brand names and even restaurants and find accurate caloric, serving, and carb info, and it tracks your exercise and activities too.  But most importantly, it tracks your water consumption. That is huge for me!  Using this app is going to change my life and quite possibly save it in the process.

3263,2,2014-03-01T19:14:45.000Z,LynnMicheleW,How is this rated so highly!?,"I gave this app two stars because it wasn't COMPLETELY useless.  It calculates a calorie intake goal for you based on your personal goal of losing, gaining or maintaining weight.  When you start tracking the scanner used to scan products into the app is convenient, but not necessary since I can read.  And most food products with a barcode have a nutrition label.  Everything else is a waste of time.  For foods that don't have barcodes (I make almost all of my own foods: hummus, almond milk, ketchup, etc.) you have to somehow magically know the calorie content.  Weight watchers has a search function on their app and if I were to type in hummus, for example, it would bring up a bunch of hummus types and brands and I could choose one to add to my point tracker. Even if it isn't exact, id have some options.  Also: there is a search feature on their activity tracker too.  On THIS app?  Good luck- unless you also magically know how many calories your workout session burned.",
3264,5,2016-04-11T23:27:12.000Z,bakerhood,Be brutally honest with your tracking and this will work,"It's simple to use, it provides a ton of value for the free version. The database is deep, it's been extremely reliable, but only when you don't cheat! If you can be diligent and brutally honest with your entries, this app will keep you on track and on goal. Over time, thanks to repetition, you'll be able to estimate calories without referencing the app, but KEEP entering everything into the app! It keeps you accountable and that's half the battle, to stay brutally honest and accountable for your calories intake. If you're new to this type of app, expect some upfront time logging food into your favorites/recurring meals, but once they're available, the app makes it super simple to select from those food items and emails again. Updating becomes a breeze.",

I lost 25lbs in only a few months 4 years ago using this app. I have always been an athlete but I wasn't the best eater till using this app. I even used it while I was pregnant to make sure I ate enough. I only gained 25lbs and lost it all only a few days later. I only have a few suggestions for the Livestrong App. 1) there should be an option for pregnant and breastfeeding in profile so it changes your calorie intake 2) you should be able to share your plate to someone else's phone (like your husband) 3) there are still some workouts not in the system (ex.

I went ahead and payed for the one year Gold membership since it is working to help me see what I'm consuming, as well as the distribution of protein, fat, and carbs.  This makes it much easier to see where I need to make changes.  I LOVE the scanner for automatic entry of foods!  It doesn't always have them, but it's easy to add a new one and their nutrient value in that case.  I also LOVE that you can make your own meal entries for things consumed often.

Then the app was updated, and the whole thing was changed. Instead of being able to visually see, with both a pie chart and the amounts shown in grams, how much fat/protein/carbs I was taking in each day, the update now shows how many grams of fat/protein/carbs I have ""left"" for the day. Then when you ""run out"" of your allotted fat/protein/carbs, it doesn't even tell you how many grams of each you've taken in through the day; it just says you have 0.0 grams left. It's not until the day after that you can see how many grams of each you ended the day with. With the diet I have to follow, this does me no good.

Some servings are completely useless--a ""slice""? That is not a unit of measure. Measuring chunky stuff like fruit by the cup is terribly inaccurate -- just let me weigh it. They did fix one issue in making foods entered for a given meal available to other meals under ""recently eaten."" But, why can't I create meals within the app? All-in-all, these are fairly minor complaints--app works very well all told.",
3282,5,2014-03-20T05:25:27.000Z,TimI337,Update is awesome,"The update added most of the features I wanted but didnt have before. 1) tracking total grams protein, carbs, fat per day. Before it only showed daily percent. 2) able to add to daily food tracker after day is over.",
3283,4,2015-03-04T17:47:52.000Z,QualityVibe,Enjoy this app,"This apps gets the job done. Simple to understand and easy to customize. If you are trying to track some food you ate and it's not in the database, you can create it yourself. It then keeps the created item in your recently consumed list which is excellent in my book. Perfect for those who may tweak there food and know the macros may need adjustment. On the flip side, the app has a few bugs (nothing that is a game breaker though). Sometimes after you track your meal, if will shoot you a reminder to track your meal...this could be just a input timing issue. I also noted one day it did lose my progress from the day before. Anyways, the app is great imo. Fits my needs of being able to compile everything I ate for the day and track my progress.",

The only suggestion I have is that dessert is also an option. I often find myself piling dessert in the dinner or snack category, making it seem like I ate about 400 extra calories. Also, I think that drinks should have their own category, because I always forget to add my drink to my meal. The last thing is that I think this app should have a wider variety of options of food to add. They should have all popular chain restaurant food items. I hope this review was helpful and do not let this stop you from trying the app. These are just suggestions to improve it. This app has truly improved my health and motivation and I will be using this for a very long time!",

I had always eaten very healthy, i.e. very low fat and low sugar diet. And yet I was gaining weight. With this app I discovered that I was just eating too much! So keeping track of what and how much I eat helped me learn much more about healthy nutrition, but I also lost 39 pounds in 4 months (bear in mind, I exercise hard 5-6 times a week). I also love the high-intensity interval training routines the Exercise section has. They were hard to complete for the first couple of months! Great way to really push yourself in 10 minutes. Long story short, one of the best apps I've ever had on my phone.",

To my great DM surprise, the LiveStrong app is exactly what I was looking for!  It's customizable without too many steps to go through, and - best of all - it works!!  I've been using the app faithfully for about 6 weeks and I've lost 11 lbs and already feel much healthier!   Since I've had so much success using the free version I'm ready now to take advantage of the very reasonably-priced full version to reach my overall goals.  I highly recommend this app!",

I'm not sure where they get the values for some of them as there are obvious errors in many. One Example: Extra virgin olive oil (Colivita). Total calories 120. Calories from fat 126. Where did the extra six calories come from??? A minor complaint, but who knows how many other values are off.",

There is a remarkable amount of foods pre-programmed into the app, I have only had to manually add 2 individual foods, which is so nice because it's very quick & efficient to use the search & everything pops right up. It's not just a calorie counter either, the food list shows fat, protein & carbs nutrition facts per serving as well!  It also allows you to track the water you drink (super important!) and log your weight (which it displays as a chart) so cool!!!

I used another app and did not lose much weight and did not stick with it.  I think this one is working because it give me a more realistic calorie count for my age and activity level.  By the way, I am a senior citizen and can now wear a size 8-10.  Give it a try.  The key to success is to enter every bite you take and plan ahead if you are going to eat out.  Look up the calorie count BEFORE you eat it--not after like I have done a few times.  I never again will scarf down a 7-11 brownie then look up the calories when I get home.  Those suckers have 600 calories in them!  Good luck you can do it!",
3292,5,2012-11-04T18:52:57.000Z,4everGodsgurl,Highly satisfied,First and foremost this app is free so I am still amazed at the quality of this app. For awhile I even thought maybe it was a trial version and after certain amount of time I would be prompted to buy full version. I just knew it had to be a catch. Not only is it still free but at this point if they charged me I would buy it because I'm hooked. I only been using it for one week and lost 5.7 lbs in one week. I recommend it to any and everyone. It's so perfect that its right on your phone so easy to track and keeps you conscious of everything you eat an portion sizes. And any food and exercise you can think of was in database. I'm telling everyone about this!!!!,

And it seems that the app is having major issues since the iOS update. For one, scanning items has become nearly impossible. Every item either doesn't exist or I get an error message. Two, the app crashes constantly. I can't add my exercise on for the day and it drives me crazy to have to turn off my phone and try again. Third, searching food items needs some work. I searched steamed corn a few days ago. After shutting off wifi 3 times, I finally got a few choices. The app doesn't use wifi and doesn't recognize the demand to use wifi. So it does need some SERIOUS TLC. But over all the app looks and feels good to use. It has a sensible calorie goal and in a week I've lost 5 pounds. It feels great to be out of a size 18.",

I love scanning in foods, which for the most part the app recognizes. I've built up a decent database up until this last update. After the update, a lot of my foods' nutritional content were changed (i.e. My peanut butter is now 14 calories per 2 tbsp). And as much as I wish it were true, it's not and it's thrown off my calorie counts. The pictures of the foods were also switched, but that was just convenience. I still love the app, but now I need to revise most of my food already entered which is a pain. Hopefully this will not happen again with the next update. I would've given 5 stars before the update.",
3295,4,2015-01-29T06:11:05.000Z,Jezzy's Girl,"Excellent app, but...","The nutrition info is off on a LOT of foods (as compared to the actual label on the product), even ""verified"" ones. In most cases, it usually seems to underestimate the calories in an item; although I've run into it being over a couple of times. I've also noticed that some specific items have several different options with varying nutrition facts, even if the portion is the same. It would be nice if the food database had fewer repeat items with different info, and had consistently accurate information. It's a bit ridiculous that I can scan a barcode and come up with incorrect nutrition facts.",

If you enter everything you eat honestly it makes you accountable for the choices you make which, hopefully, leads to better ones! It also lets you keep track of exercise which is also motivation to get to enter your workouts in! All in all I love it and it does just what it says, helps you track your calories :) just remember that calories are not all equal so 150 cal of salad and 150 cal or chips are not the same so go healthy when you can!",

It just shows a blank screen with a bunch of horizontal lines, with no ""no results found"" message, or the ability to add more foods or whatever. Not sure if their servers are having issues or what, but it's pretty annoying when you're trying to track calories and no foods are loading, makes it pretty much unusable. I wouldn't recommend getting the paid version until they figure out those loading issues.",

When I plug in half a serving, it's tracking the calories for a full serving- it even says full serving...!8 try to update to half, and save, and the full serving is still showing in my counter. The first few days using the app I didn't notice this, so was under my calorie goal for the day as the app was including calories I hadn't consumed, and telling me if already reached my goal for the day. This is getting very annoying as I'm having to either delete the half serving and tell myself not to up to the max for the day, or make up a food manually to use as a place holder. This app has such a huge list of foods, and I'm having to create a food just to have the calories, in a CALORIE COUNTING APP, correctly be counted... That's ridiculous.

One is a scanner - though the app contains a large database of foods, it also accurately added the data for a generic brand item, from its barcode. Easy to see all your daily meal, exercise and water data in one screen, plus additional screen for overall progress chart. Also has quick (5 to 10 min) workout routines, ability to add custom workouts that you do. Simple profile setup and really thoughtful community sections/topics. It's quick to track everything almost instantly, and get back to what you were doing.",

I experience a few minor issues originally but with this last update it is out of hand. All of my data got overridden by some one else. The only that I could spot that was similar between our two's data was that we both had Apple Watches(figured I would throw this out there to possibly help the devs) When I tried to sync with the server to get my data back it was to no avail. I tried logging in and back out and still someone else's data was there! When I gave up hope and decided to go create a new account, it wouldn't let me, it kept on giving me server errors. Overall I like this GUI more than My Fitness Pal but My Fitness Pal has never had an issue like this.

I have done Weights Watchers (WW) twice in the last five years with fantastic results but the reality is, it's expensive and not conducive to reality. Counting calories is so much easier than counting ""points"" and you feel free to eat what you want, when you want. This app links to you Apple Health which is even better because it also informs you how many calories you burned. I just think it's so great. I can't believe you get as much access as you do for free. There is of course a gold level which costs money but the free offer of this app provides me with all I need and more.

It is quick and easy. Most of the foods are already loaded in and a couple keystrokes will bring it up or something really close. I also love the barcode scanner. One zap and my food choice is logged and calculated. I just wish I could have everything in one app and maybe I do and just don't know it but I use my Apple Watch for fitness tracking, run for weight loss app for a virtual fitness coach, and this for food and hydration.

It's great for setting and visualizing goals which is the first crucial step to realizing those goals. There's an added bonus of mPoints you can accumulate which makes it even more interesting to log in and track each day.

Also, it would be better if it had an area where you could type if you feel bloated, or post pictures of yourself to keep track (with privacy options of course), and maybe tips on how to avoid bloat, or find fiber-rich foods, etc. But it's still a great app. I couldn't live without it!",

It gives you a snapshot of your macronutrient ratios for the day, which I've found very useful -- it's not thorough enough for an in depth evaluation however. The best part about this app is that it makes you aware of everything you put in to your body. I've actually found it hard some days to get up to my calorie goal, especially when eating good foods!

It's a great way to stay motivated and keep on track - and also review progress and slumps!  I've had no problems with it suddenly quitting or freezing - it runs really smoothly. The only thing I don't like is in the exercise section, if you want to log in a custom workout, it makes you calculate the hourly calorie burn and then divide it by the number of minutes you worked out. It used to have a function that just allowed you write in the calories you burned for the minutes you worked out.",

I have used off and on for over a year and find it very helpful to remind me where I'm at. However, the desktop version and mobile version are not syncing. This is problematic because I like to print reports to bring to appointments with me. Just showing someone on the app is too narrow to give a full picture of my calorie intake over weeks to months. If there was a way to email or print reports directly from the mobile app, this would eliminate the need for desktop syncing.

Yes, because it's user entered.  Enter your own if there isn't an entry in a measurement you need... Or use the barcode scanner.

It has everything I have been looking for in a healthy lifestyle app. I love it! It is defiantly worth a shot!

3328,5,2016-05-10T14:14:02.000Z,Susila65,Easy to use,"I really like My Plate. It is easy to use and pretty fast. It doesn't have quite as many foods as other apps, but it feels less obtrusive to me. I tried other apps and felt like I was being hounded constantly through notifications and email. I get a very helpful email from this app that was my choice to get and I actually read it. I also appreciate that it communicates with my iHealth app on excercise and steps. The one thing I find missing, and it's a biggy, is that I can't put a recipe in and have it count and divide servings. I have to go to an external website to do it. I hope they are working on that for the future.",
3329,4,2016-07-20T16:38:24.000Z,T-Mime,Needs better database,When I decided it was time to start eating more mindfully and begin keeping track of calories I downloaded this and another free diet tracker. This one won out because of the interface and the fact that it allowed me 200 more cal/day to reach my goal (I lost 2.5 lb in the first week so it must be right). The only problem is the database of food is more limited than the other app so I ended up keeping that one just as a reference when I can't find a food (especially a brand name or restaurant item) on this one. It also has weird glitches occasionally with not recording everything you enter for a new food. Overall it does the job though.,

Don't get the points part yet, but seems like I am winning and that's fun.  Kudos to you for having a great food list too, you have so much of what I eat and so that is great because it is not punishing or work to log it and keeps me out of doing this 'food math' in my head.

I also feel the calorie estimations for my daily intake are more accurate than others I've tried. A few things I'd love to see improve: 1. Searching for foods can be difficult, it seems to be somewhat limited to the order in which you enter the words in the item. (So ""brand x soup"" might not find ""soup brand x"".) 2. I'd love to see the ideal nutrient breakdown along with my actual one. 3. I'd love to have the option when I go to the recent foods or foods I eat often sections to see items from all meals, rather than just the one I'm in.",

Not only does it track what I've consumed, but I can look foods up before I eat them to see the carb and calorie counts.  Sometimes you have to get creative when listing foods and servings, but the pros far outweigh the cons.  This app has helped keep me accountable.  I love the ability to track my weight, calories, and other specifics and see a graph to identify trends.  No, not every food is on here but it does have a rather large database and you do have the option to add things.  All in all, a great app!",

I have lost 120 pounds and always wonder how many calories I was eating. I tried to count them but I didn't right them down and I would forget how many I had. Now I have found this app, I don't have to write them down or remember how much I was eating, it tells me brands I am eating and get the right calories. It tells me how many calories I am burning off and how much water I am drinking. I will get to my goal weight faster because I will know how many calories I am consuming.

It seems this app is primarily concerned with carbohydrates, fats, and sugars only... which I understand however that's not for me because I like to take into account the whole nutritional profile. So when something I'd like to track has high sodium, but displays 0 sodium since there was no option to edit that when I was adding the entry... that information becomes false (misleading) and ultimately confusing and thus useless to me. 2) I'm a visual person and I did not see the option to add pictures of my food and/or body...",

This really helps me keep track how much she has eaten over the course of the day and how much exercise she has gotten. I like that I can build a ""meal"" and then just click on that when she eats a common meal instead of having to add each ingredient each time. What I'd fix: you can't edit exercise once added and the green color on the graph makes it look good when you eat too little of something (like fiber) that you are trying to exceed. Make it red if you have too little of something like water and fiber, not green.",

I became truly motivated as soon as I saw my weight dropping just a little bit each day! If you had an eating forded or you are under weight you can pick that you want to gain weight and it tells you how many calories to eat everyday and how much to workout to gain muscles.

However, it will cost me money if I want to see how my exercise performance over time.  Older version did this free.  Scan of bar good is a great and easy feature.  Also older version better for tracking exercise by time, not just by calories consumed.  Also would be nice if it could track distances so you could like back and see how far you've gone.  Alas not to be so at some point will find another app that will track both time and distances separately.  So in retrospect probably more 3 rated than 4 but can't change the rating now.",
3345,2,2016-09-12T01:31:40.000Z,Yoga newbie 25,Used to love,"I've used this app since November and I have loved it and recommended it. Though over the past month it has seemed to fall apart. When I use the force sync it changes my weights (or adds ones I didn't enter) to 140. I emailed customer support and was told to just change them and if I needed help they would help. Umm yeah I know how to change it I just shouldn't have to. Now it has changed old dates intakes making the calories the serving size. So a day in June it said I ate 22,000 calories. For breakfast it changed a 1/3 serving of pancakes which was 64 calories to a serving of 64. I shouldn't have to go back though and consistently double check to make sure the program works. Yes I have the free version but I'm glad because if I were paying for this I would be even more infuriated.",

However the search results with key words does not always make sense. Then item unit of measure are always in ""cup"" rather than weight Oz ( like vegetables, etc) I agree that for some food it should be the default setting but the app should always give you oz as a second option (and not fl oz!). The ""create your own food"" menu should allow you to drag in already recorded ingredients so you don't have to add all proteins etc yourself. Beside these little room for improvement suggestions, I am very happy with this App.",

The fat/carb/protein chart really helped me realize how little protein I've been eating and allowed me to adjust. Now my appetite has gone from binge eating 24/7 to actually having to remind myself to eat every few hours because I don't have the cravings I used to. Also, the ""create new food"" under the my food menu is perfect for those who cook solely from recipes.

I have noticed though that a few food items have incorrect nutritional values for them. For example there are two different choices for a single date where one is correct & the other has something like 500ish g of carbs & 600ish g of fat in ONE pitted date. Also when you manually enter your exercises it won't recalculate calories burned if you adjust the times if you went longer or shorter distances. Also not enough exercises to chose from, just the basics. As I said it is a great tool for beginner dieters & those who need refreshed on how many calories they consume but I wouldn't recommend to those who know the general basics of nutritional facts",

It used to have a wheel to spin so that you could easily change your serving size from 1/4 of a serving up to multiple servings, and water from 2 oz up. Now in order to change the serving, you have to hit a tiny little window, that is to close to the ""I ate that"" button and very unresponsive. Often while trying to open it I end up hitting the button above, and then I have to go into the ""my diary"" section to try to edit it. I REALLY wish they would just CHANGE IT BACK!

The two downsides and hence the reason for only four stars are that for as robust as the foods options are when you enter your calories I find a lot of products are not available for scan.  The list of sku's and restaurant foods needs to continue to evolve.  But again I am still giving 4out of 5 stars for the total ease of use and functionality.  The only other downside (and honestly it is a separate app) is the Drink Water app.  I can't remember what is was called but whatever it was I just plain and simply could not figure out how to use it properly.,

The only thing I wish I could do would be to read ingredients and instructions for recipes so I can cook from my phone (this can be done on the mobile site so it's not a huge deal, but would be nice to have access to it on the app).

I'm using mine more for a weight tracker than a calorie tracker but I fin it fun and easy to input my calorie intake. I wish that the progress chart showed my weight first and foremost but I'm okay with switching it because I know this is a calorie tracker and not a weight tracker app. It's very user friendly and very easy to navigate. I think it just needs a little work on some of the verified foods because those are the ones that seem to be off the most. I usually just adjust my intake to reflect the correct amount.,

This is incorrect and careless, and it's polluting my medical record with phony data points. Stop!!! Only record a new weight when I add one! And stop requiring weight in the first place.",

Also, for particular food choices without bar codes, it's difficult to know what to choose as there's no indication of size or what the item contains. For instance looking for pesto pasta pulls up 30 generic options to choose from - all with different calorie counts. Also, some options have the term 'recipe' next to it but it's not clear if you need the gold membership to view these or what.

The only thing I would improve it the exercise portion doesn't have much to choose from. Such as if I did 100 sit ups it wants you to say how long instead of how many or if you did 100 squats there is no choice for squats (it's annoying) other then that it's great!

Fiber is such an important part of a balanced diet, and a easy single look percentage would be super helpful.  But mostly, I really like this app. I do feel like the food journal is somewhat general, since I am not weighing every single meal. So I don't rely on it for 100% accuracy.

I watch my carb intake per meal/snack not only for weight but for diabetic/medical reasons. It doesn't really track that. Some of the exercises are limited; I have to manually enter my long runs from Nike+. The only thing I know that comes with the upgrade is adding recipes and such which I'm still deciding if its worth it. Despite my own personal areas I would like, the app is fabulous for tracking weight, calories, water intake, exercise, etc.",

You can track & scan food and get a breakdown of your protein, fats, carbs etc for the day in a graph. You can also graph your weight loss and scan food. This app is awesome & it's free. I highly recommend it. The only thing I don't like is that you get extra calories based on your exercise for the day. I just ignore the bonus calories but some days I am tempted :) if you're looking for a way to track & lose weight this is it & the reminders really keep you focused. Download it today.",

On my iPhone 5s, however, it does occasionally freeze up and/or crash. I have had to actually uninstall and reinstall it a few times, but it has been a few weeks since that has happened, so hopefully it has been corrected. Obviously, I like the app enough that I went through the ""hassle"" of deleting it, reinstalling it and redoing all of the settings, so it has been worth it, and I have become much more aware of what I eat and have lost a few pounds as an added bonus!",

I liked the amount of foods that were already in the database as well as the ability to make your own manual entries fairly easily. The graphing feature is nice and it synchs to the Health app in my phone. Yadda Yadda...It has worked totally fine up until today and all of a sudden all of my days have a bunch of entries I didn't make and completely ridiculous counts for stuff (uh like my weight is off by +100 lbs and it has me eating about 6000 calories more than I do daily, lol). So I'm not sure whether I'll ever get my data back? I don't think there's any sort of backup. Maybe that's a feature they should add now, given that the system is obviously susceptible to serious bugs. :-(",

I have been trying to get more healthy and exercise so this helps me stay focused on what I need to do to cut back on unnecessary calories. I will say, however, I'm not sure I like not having the ability to alter the portions of food that I take in. Specifically, when you choose a food, while there are many choices, many times I will have half of the portion that is listed. Example, I had half of an ear of corn but my only option was to choose a full year of corn. Otherwise, it's a pretty good app.",

Being mindful or the macronutrients/calories one eats in a day is very helpful for losing weight and reaching fitness goals. In fact, you'll likely find out you should be eating MORE food than you already do, but of course, that doesn't mean upgrading to the large meal combo, it means eating more meals more frequently throughout the day.

My only complaint is the small amount of workouts available, even if you pay (which I didn't, and I won't). Adding workouts should be easier. The provided workouts are in 5-10 minute options, but the custom option seems to be calories burned hourly.

It is the only thing I have found that really works for me and my hectic schedule. Good food selection. Great for a lite app. Only wish is that I could build a meal from scratch and wish it could give me a projected weight loss estimate over time. Also wish it would show the full details of other's recipes. Perhaps that's in the full version? Would highly recommend though! Only a few more pounds to go until I reach my goal.

A couple weeks ago I downloaded this alongside a couple other food tracking apps, and I found myself using this one less and less because of the annoying adds. Yeah, the other apps have all the ""gold"" stuff, but they do it in a way that is much less obtrusive. Livestrong, if you want to win me back, don't have large banner adds on the home-screen.. it really takes away from the experience. Other than that, this is a great app!",

I have lost 30lbs since I started using the app!  The only criticism I have is the exercise portion. I went on an (approximately) 2.5 mile walk/run on Sunday carrying my phone and the app only logged 6 calories burned and the day before that I went on a four mile walk/run and it logged over 2800 calories burned!  Neither one sound right! Need some work on that part of the app. The food catalog is great though, better than my Fitbit app's food catalog. Thanks!",

It's so easy to use because it remembers your favorite foods. I just tracked all the food I ate today in about 3 minutes. It was helpful to do, and I realized I have 100 calories left today after eating dinner, which means I can have a small piece of chocolate. (yum!) I love how it automatically tracks my steps too. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. This is a great app if you want to lose weight. There are also 5 and 10-minute workouts inside the app.",

It can not handle a search for ""saut√©ed kale"" and immediately dies on me. 2- some basic foods take a long time to find and anything homemade is pretty much out of the question. This app is great for people who eat the prepackaged, processed, grocery store foods but if you want to know how many calories there are in apple crisp, good luck. 3- the choices for exercise are limited. Bikram yoga is pretty popular but that app can't find it. The term ""walking"" is also an issue, you can't use the present participle version of a verb, you have to use the present tense verb.",

I also wished there were more information on tracking nutrition rather than simply calories, fat and protein. I'm using this app to keep track of what I eat to ensure that I am getting the nutrients I need. It'd be great if there were an app that helped me keep track of the important vitamins I consume.",

It's adding extra exercises I don't perform and it screws with my calorie intake and it's very upsetting then to make sure I don't eat too many calories and actually keep track. So please fix asap!

I tracked everything on my phone app, then had to manually enter on the computer to transfer the PDF of the class.

I've used myfitnesspal, and it has many more ways to track your progress and allows you to update/edit an entry. Overall, this is far too simplistic, and, should you need to adjust an entry, I've not found a way to do so (for example, I wanted to change my water intake from 8 to 48, I clicked 48, no change, I tried again, no change, and then suddenly, it updated and now I have 250+ ounces and there is no way to correct this!!!, imagine if I made this mistake with a food entry???) There is only a daily tracker for calories consumed and percentages, and let's face it, we all have a bad day, so a weekly total/percentage would be nice. Heading back to MFP until things change.",

I am in control of my own fork, but the DB has both salad and peanut butter by the cup or Tablespoon (which may explain the gain!).  LOVE the new ""scan""-ability; wish it had a somewhat larger DB (flavored coffee creamer: ""I don't think you want to eat that!""). Wish there were on-line instructions to adding customized items.

I have gold so I could unlock everything and I'm glad that I did purchase the extras.  I am very happy with this app!  It also has workouts just in case you need to burn calories as well.

It should e easier to enter in your custom foods and not having to say you ate it right then. Have a general custom food database that i can save seperate from the what I am eating menus. Also the fact that I can't see how many grams of protein and carbs I've eaten is absurd. You are going beyond that to tell me what percentage I've eaten, but why not the exact grams? You have the info so just show it. And finally, the ""rewards/achievements"". Just get rid of them. It's annoying to have that pop up over and over. I'm not gonna use it, so why force it on me? Overall 3/5.",

I'm pretty sure what ever is in it, is what others have added. I say that based on the number of duplicates and why things are named. Simple solution, a scanner! If you can't find what you just ate, I would rate this app 5 stars if it had a scanner to pull up the name and nutritional facts! I know it's possible, because I've used other apps that have the function and its awesome! I really like the charts that this app uses to how you visually what you're consuming.",

I liked the idea of pre-packaged plans -- until I saw the price.  Decided the best way was the simplest -- just count calories.  Saw this app had high marks.  Love it!  the graphics are great, it's intuitive, has a lovely list of indexed foods (haven't tried the scanner), allows for custom foods (mmm. Moroccan stew... and low cal!) -- and it includes water intake, which is actually quite important for me.  Highly recommend this app.",

I don't like the limited fitness choices. If I type in something as simple as ""abs"" or ""biking,"" nothing comes up. The only activities I have found already programmed into the app are running, walking, swimming and UFC strength (not general strength training or weights). The app seriously needs to expand the list of exercise activities to include things like biking, rollerblading, isolated body groups (abs, upper body, lower body), cardio, etc. Not everyone is a runner!",

The food database is jaw dropping. I am an Indian and many times I eat ethnic Indian food. The Indian dishes we make at home here is not what you typically find in Indian Restaurants here in USA and yet I was able to find all obscure Indian dishes cooked only in certain local regions in India. I was not expecting to find it at all but so far I have found every single item I have searched for in the database. It really is jaw dropping.,

I like the circle graph to display your macro's and the bar towards your calorie goal. It's likely not to happen because it's a rare situation, but I would like to set when my day starts and ends because I work overnights and I'd like to track my calories for the day as 2pm to 10am kind of thing. Other than that I have no complaints. The paid-for feature are very fair and definitely not necessary to get the full experience ‚úîÔ∏è",

There are a few things that I don't like for instance when it comes to putting in your food for the day it really doesn't give you a lots of options when it comes to serving size so you have to do a lot of compromising. Second, I don't like the way you input your weight for the week. It does not show a progress chart for that very easily. I went ahead and bought the living strong membership hoping that it would track my weight better but it doesn't. The free ones just as good as the paid one don't waste your money.",

Food, exercise, weight, and water can be tracked easily, and it shows protein, fat, and carb percentages. It's very user-friendly! I've used it every single day since December. Sometimes it crashes, but it's worth it due to that the app is so helpful. The barcode scanning on food packaging and net calorie calculations are incredibly useful.

Right before the new year I was 173 lbs and now it is jan 11th and I'm at 163lbs because this app calculated my BMI and BMR so that I could calculate the right amount of calories I actually needed. Only one downside and that is that this app doesn't show how much sugar you are eating or most nutrients we get from veggies and fruits. Otherwise I think this is great!,

But if you are like me you will be checking the actual calories you burn by double checking other sites. I only do specific exercises and list heavy activity so I figure I am ahead anyway. It could use some work on food but just look for ""verified"" foods and you'll be just fine. I enjoy watching how many calories I consume and being truly honest about it. This app works great for that because when I am close to half my calories consumed I start paying way more attention.",

The only problem is that I can't seem to figure out how to edit my exercise! I put in the wrong thing and I can't take it out, so I end up with 1,000 burned calories instead of 100üòÇ and I can't take it out.

I would have given it five stars before today but all of a sudden everything on my app is wrong it says that yesterday I burn 53,000 calories! Which is clearly wrong everything is totally messed up all of the stuff on the app all of the data that I have tracked over the last two months is gone and it's replaced with all kinds of other things that aren't mine like one of them was Michael's Apple Watch (not me) and playing violin and all of these things that I've never done to burn calories so it's really confusing and very annoying but I've lost everything.

However need to be very careful with serving sizes as the app doesn't always match the package label (ex. the salad I had for lunch was labeled as a 2 cup serving for 110 cals, the app brought up a 1 cup serving for 110 cals when scanned). Also, it appears you can only add exercise not remove it - I mistyped the time I spent walking and was unable to correct it, it just continued adding more time so my ""allowed"" calories were waaay off for the day.

It's very helpful and practical because it tells you the exact calories per serving so I know just about everything about the food I'm eating. I love the calorie tracker and the progress bar :) this is very practical for someone who is trying to lose weight. I can't wait to see my final results!,

This year I just wanted a way to know how many calories I needed to eat per day based on my weight and still lose weight...I love to eat!

If you enter food in enter calories manually for something that's not in the db using a base serving amt and then at some point you track less than the base amount, in future searches what comes up for the food is the base serving size with the lesser serving cal count!  This is a pain to manually edit every single time you eat an amt that differs from the base serving. What is the point of having it keep the non-db foods at all?  I think I will just try and app that actually lets you keep your own additional db of custom foods.",

I feel that it would be nice to see which items on your daily menu are putting you into the red, rather then going back and forth trying to figure out which item(s) are putting you there (in the red). And also made when you do that query that it would have suggestions to what you could op'd for instead.

Haha and I know they can't fix that but a great thing to add would be counting your steps or something because I don't really know how many calories I burned from walking a mile... Another great thing to add would be to have vitamin and mineral consumption count as part of your daily overall health thing because it is in real life!!

When I first started using a couple weeks ago it was great. Now, for the last week, I get no results when I search for an item to add to my diary. No error, no ""no results found"", nothing. It just stops working. If its not something I already added to my diary in the first week (in recent foods), I can't add it. Useless now.

The only thing I wish this app would incorporate is a symptoms tracker or, if that is too specific, a free text field where I could make notes on flare up symptoms. This app is by far the best food/weight tracking app I've tried for Crohn's and I would highly recommend it to anyone with the condition. As a note to developers:  you may wish to add Crohn's as a key word for this app so that it shows up for people who are searching that way.",

3475,1,2016-10-08T14:19:22.000Z,Silly Suz,Frustrated,Many of the aspects of this app look good.  I am frustrated as I downloaded the app 2 days ago and I have only been able to add 1 food item of my own to the more detailed create a food section.  Every time I try to do so it tells me that it can't be saved.  So I end up having to do the quick add.  I need to track some of the more detailed nutrition info.  The one that finally did go through I see that I made a spelling error on the food name.  I try to edit it and it won't let me . I even purchased the app thinking that was the problem. I will give it through today and if it is not fixed I'm seeking a refund. Really disappointed considering how much success everyone seems to be having with it.,
3476,3,2017-02-07T17:27:14.000Z,Emperor Maximilian IV,"Useful, but ...","I like the convenience, and the nutritional analysis, and especially the bar-code-scanning capability. But when searching for the food you want to enter, you have to wade past far too many utterly useless, stupid user-provided entries like ""Lasagna‚Äî1 serving, 200 calories,"" ""Lasagna‚Äî1/6 of pan, 250 calories,"" ""Barbara's Lasagna‚Äî176 calories."" Please eliminate all entries that fail to use standards measurements! At least they have weeded out the user-supplied exercises, which used to include things like ""Sitting and smoking 10 minutes‚Äî15 calories,"" and I'm not making that up.

I can even enter what I will eat ahead of time if I'm going to a barbecue etc. The couple of negatives I have is the graph tracker is all over the place. It didn't start off at my actual weight, much less. That's the little graph on the left. The larger one in the center makes no sense at all. I do love it other than that and in the three months I've been doing this, I've lost 18 pounds! Nice amount in that time, not too fast or slow. That's important at my age, I'm 67 and have about fifty more to lose so have to be concerned with wrinkles!",

I use to love the user interface to this app. It was quick, intuitive, and informative. Now since it changed in March 2017 the user interface is awkward and slow.

I search for ""spin, bike and even cycle"" and the only thing I can find is ""unicycle""... Really??!! Is that popular enough that you have to have that in the database?). Also, if a food item isn't found I normally try scanning the barcode to add it. That really only works maybe 1 out of 10 times. And sometimes when it does work, the item shows up with more calories than what's listed on the packaging. Pretty happy with everything else.",

With my lifestyle and consistent diet it allows me to see what else I need to eat and keep me with my goal. I made so much progress with this app and I sincerely hope the developers stick with it.

3483,4,2014-07-21T15:00:58.000Z,westonyoung,A few flaws,"This app is an all-in-one calorie and exercise tracker, which is very nice to have. I noticed that some of the nutrition facts were incorrect, but that is probably not a widespread issue. Also, when entering your own foods manually, it does not allow you to add fiber or sugar values, which are important to me. Also, I wish it would show you the amounts of fiber and sugar you have eaten over the course of a day, instead of just calories, carbs, fat, and protein. But overall, this app has worked quite well for me with no bugs or crashes so far.",
3484,4,2014-08-18T23:22:24.000Z,iglobetrotter1,Very useful but room to improve,"I'm new to calorie counting, and have found the app very good for tracking calories. Fairly extensive database of foods - good. Some identical food entries have widely divergent calories - confusing. Nice that one can add foods, but would be better if one could also add the details on calories from carbs, protein & fat.",
3485,4,2015-06-02T13:35:03.000Z,Cdk17,Mostly a love,I have been using this app for 6 months and pretty much love it! I downloaded several to try and this was easiest for me and I love the tracking tool to watch my progress. My only gripe is with the most recent update. They changed the water tracking. You used to be able to add your water a little at a time and it would auto add to your total. Now you have to go in and manually change your total every time. I know it's simple math but it was just easier the other way! I hope they change it back!,
3486,5,2015-07-07T05:29:08.000Z,The Dirt Man,Best Diet App Out There,I luv this app. It does everything u could possibly want for a diet app. It regulates everything u eat in a way that makes sticking to a diet seem doable. It also has an exercise regulator so u know how many calories ur burning and makes sure ur staying in shape while ur doing ur diet. U also can scan products so u don't have to search the food ur eating. What's great about that feature is u don't have to figure out how many calories u just ate. It tells u already. This app is awesome an I highly suggest it.,

I would give it 5 stars but I can't find a way to change my exercise on the app once I have input it. So if I put 30 minutes of exercise when I only did 15 minutes, I can't change it on my phone.

Helps you calculate what your calorie intake should be, allows you to account for calories burned in exercise, allows you to add your own meals (like your own favorite Mac and cheese recipe) and figure calories and nutritional info per serving. Only annoyance is often too many items (like ""medium peach"") have too many variations in nutritional content that pop up when you search - should do more housekeeping to identify verified calorie counts.",

The calories remaining bar at the top needs to be programmed to match the net calories number not add the net calories and the allotted amount.

Not allowing a goal under 1200 isn't going to protect someone from a restrictive eating disorder. It will, however, annoy someone who is very petite and eating 1000 per day, or someone who is on a very low calorie diet prescribed by their doctor etc. Seriously, people who've had weight-loss surgery must use this app, and most of those people are on a 500 calorie diet for a few weeks. Please, please change this. <1200 per day can be healthy for many different people, and this app is supposed to be a tool, not my doctor",
3496,1,2016-09-21T14:08:11.000Z,jrasimmons,Poor Exercise Tracker,The app promotes itself with the capacity to transfer exercise logs from iPhone's health app into the app for calorie reduction. This feature does not work well. If it records anything in the app it isn't accurate or consistent. This is a major setback in the app. It also is without enough verified foods. So many inaccurate submissions exist within the searchable food field that it's ineffective to attempt to use any of the apps current data. You're better off entering in your own nutrition count. The other downfall is it doesn't offer a wide enough variety of entry information. Calorie count and carbs are basically the only two items you can manually enter in. It's a major flaw.,

I just wish that instead of having water as a category it'd be drinks as a whole so it could record how much water you get from those drinks as well. Also it's not so easy to record your exercise. Like I tried to log push-ups and it was by time duration not by how many I did. People go at different paces so I feel like time duration isn't accurate.

Also, it lets you customize meals, for example, I always eat the same Lean Cuisines, so I can program those into the app so I don't have to re-enter it every time. On the down side, I can't seem to figure out how to adjust what the app thinks my target calorie I take should be per day...I think it is a bit high based on my height, but I think the target calories per day is based on BMI.",

You can either do a search or you can scan items. I like how you have a running calculation of the calories you have left to consume for the day for the day. One suggestion would be to have some data on how many calories you burn doing different types of simple exercises such as walking for 20 minutes or running for 20 minutes. Other than that great app I'm definitely going to keep this one.,

However I will be purchasing a Fitbit soon so I no longer have to worry about that too much. With MyFitnessPal your able to get EXACT measurements with your food to get the most accurate results. Fitbit doesn't allot calories when you're doing strength training just cardio. But again that may change once I get my Fitbit and it'll monitor that.,

Now instead of showing you what you have eaten and what percent of your day's diet it was, there are bars based on static macro goals with how much you have left in the day. And if you go over, you can't tell by how much. It just says zero grams left for the day. And if you work out that day your calorie goal adjusts, but the macros don't. The old version would show you the macro ratios no matter how much you ate so you could stay in balance during days with varying calorie burns. Plus they added more clicks to do the same thing and the new design requires scrolling to see the same information (calories per meal, calories burned). I used to like this app.",

I tracked everything I ate and it helped me to lose the 5lbs I wanted to shed. It also helped me eat healthier (foods with more vitamins, minerals & protein) and with more purpose (avoid mindless snacking) because it provides the percentages of fat, protein and carbs you're eating daily.

First, when I open the app, often the date on top is something from a year or 2 ago so after I enter my info for a meal and return to the main screen, there is nothing there and it has somehow come back to ""today"" and I ten have to re-enter everything.

My Plate said they would fix it, and all our original data would not be lost, but although they updated the app, all the crazy numbers remain. I had to disconnect My Health and erase all erroneous data. I have been waiting for it to work, so I tried it today. Entered all my breakfast food, but when I went back to enter lunch, it was all gone! What the heck?! Changing over to the My Fitness Pal app since this one no longer works.",

I use the app as well as the website and they often are not synchronous.  The food and workout I input on one does not update on the other. The suggested daily calorie intake and is also different on the app then online so it's difficult to know which one to follow and where I am and hitting my target for the day.

I have made continued progress (11 pounds lost in annual physical) but now want to get to my real goal of another 20 pounds off.  The integration of the exercise also works great as a motivator to get off your posterior to burn off those Fritoes...then don't eat the junk anymore for a double benefit  ;-),

I might even buy the premium upgrade if I didn't have one substantial problem. I believe that if you enable the app to access fitness data from HealthKit, it will ""double dip"" from both iPhone steps and Apple Watch steps. Therefore the app things that I've walked twice as far, and effectively doubles the amount of calories that the app tells me that I can eat.

I'm allowed 1,200 a day to lose weight and if I'm under that by more that 10 it gives a warning saying I'm eating too little to have healthy weight loss without putting my body into starvation mode and that I need to be at the goal.

I started at 366 and am at 275 headed to 210 at 6' 5"" and 70 years old.  The trick is to measure everything, eat above BMR and less than TDEE.  A 3500 calorie deficit is equal to 1 pound of fat.  If you go below BMR, you will go into starvation mode and gain weight while losing muscle.  As you get closer to your target weight, you have to reduce your calorie deficit.

The app is pretty great, but there can be lots of bugs (often shows no results when searching for a common food). My husband and I have the same app, and it worked differently for us- I could look some foods up but he couldn't, which is very frustrating when we eat the same meals. He has moved on to another app, but I'm hoping for many more improvements in future updates since I've used it for so long.",

There is only one complaint that I have, and that is the fact that you can't go back to past days and edit what you ate. I find this a tad annoying because I often find myself at midnight, trying to track my intake for the day, and finding that everything has been reset by 12:00, leaving me unhappy with an inaccurate reading for that day. If that could be fixed, I would have no problem at all.",

I have dietary restrictions and there something for everyone provided. Its also a relief the app does not bug you more than makes you accountable to stay on target!,

Equipped with a huge database of very specific nutritional information (from Olive Garden's Lasagna Primavera to Special K's Cracker Chips), you can easily keep track of your calories. You can set goals; track your weight, exercise, bmi, diet diary; and even get encouragement from others who are managing their weight on the ""community"" feature. I highly recommend it.",

I normally don't even write reviews but I had to for this app. I downloaded my fitness pal and it never really helped me, the format for my plate is so much better! it makes more sense and is easier to navigate. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because sometimes my calories that burned turn to 0 even though they were at a higher number before, but it normally changes back to the actual amount.",

It has almost every item in it and offers the option to add items if they aren't located in the system already. You can add in calories burned by just adding the number of calories or by entering a certain activity and it calculates by time spent doing the activity or by number of exercises.",

It's so nice being mindful of what I am eating. I love that it syncs with my phone and tracks the calories I have lost throughout the day. I've had zero issues. I love being able to see what I have eaten, what more nutrients I need more/less of, how many calories I have burned through exercise and daily things..lovely. Recommend highly.",

However, it is not without its glitches, the one that keeps reoccurring is it loses your daily tracking from the current day and moves it to the day before and since this happens regularly even with the new layout/look I'm hoping this glitch will go away. That being said I like the new layout/look. Fix the glitches and I'll gladly rate 5 stars!",Hi Evansilly- thank you for the review! We'd love to help you with the glitch you're experiencing.

My one complaint is that it does not sync up with my Apple Watch, meaning it does not know the calories I burned that day or how many steps I walked. I really wish this app did this. The app for the Apple Watch is also easy to use and add what you ate, but once again does not account for workouts or calories burned even though it is on my Watch. I would probably pay for this app yearly if it automatically took data from my Apple Watch.",

It makes using it very time-consuming. Additionally, the only way I could get it to save a Custom Food entry (I drink smoothies, so had figured out the nutritional profile to enter) was to say ""I ate this"" which wasn't true- I was just trying to set up my frequent common foods for future use.",
3592,5,2014-09-23T00:50:08.000Z,SerenaSTL,Very Convenient,"I was using the website off and on over the last few years whenever I needed to track my diet. The app is even more convenient. The list of foods already in the system is pretty good and adding an item is easy. Of course the list is not as exhaustive as what you mind be used to if you started out using the website, but it's still better than many of the apps out there.",
3593,5,2015-04-14T20:58:03.000Z,Rey52328,Best Tracker I've Used,"I used to use another tracker for many years, a popular one. This is so much better. It is faster at finding foods. It doesn't segregate your past foods into specific meal times so that you don't have to go searching for them for every meal. It allows you to look at graphs for everything besides weight. It doesn't force you to make an online profile. So much better and much easier to use. Thank you!",
3594,2,2017-03-12T19:24:30.000Z,Magnet79,Update NOT an improvement,"The latest update seems to have added nothing to the app in any way I can perceive while it certainly subtracted much: the visual pie chart for macros is gone; once over your daily amount you now no longer see total grams, just that you have none left; loss of ""nutrition label"" views for total daily. After over a year and a half of using My Plate I was finally considering purchasing the Gold upgrade but that will not be happening unless the great FUNCTIONAL parts of the app return. I have really loved this app and do hope it's made as useful to me again as it was before.",

I really like that your daily protein, carb & fat intake is shown in percentages along with an overall easy to view summary of breakfast, lunch, dinner & snack calories eaten/remaining.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because like any other food app I wish all my food/calorie searches were in the database. Having said that, most are or can be created.",

It is easy to input meals and snacks, it is easy to check how much weight you lost or gained, and I love the fact that it has a community bar that lets you talk to people who are in the same boat. I love the new input buttons and overall it has a clean but still fun appearance. It has helped me reach milestones and I hope it helps me reach my goal.",

Outside of this little jog I've just sat at a computer all day, and now I don't know how many calories I actually have left today. MyFitnessPal never had this issue.

An improvement would be to be able to go back a day or more and add additional foods to the diary.  Sometimes you eat late or are out and cannot get it into the diary b4 midnight and then you cannot add foods as far as I can tell.  You can guesstimate the calories and adjust foods you did eat to reflect the numbers, but the other way would be better I think.",

If you do the work it really keeps you motivated. The one thing I would add, for all the women dieters including myself that I know. I would make the way in the system on a decimal basis. A lot of women look at 142.3 and 137.8 as True measurement and it shows even the most incremental progress. With this app it only rounds off or up.

I like that it keeps track of my weight loss/ gain and that it also keeps track of the calories I have burned from walking for the day based on my weight-height-age. I can also add calories burned through work outs. I will continue to use this app as long as it continues to be free and offer all of these app benefits.",

On my list of frequently eaten foods are items that I have had one time. Missing will be something that I may have eaten as recently as the previous day's meal. I have learned over time that frequently and recently eaten foods are linked up to the Meal that you have selected.,
3613,4,2015-08-20T16:17:13.000Z,AutumnSeasonHarvey13,Decent but some improvements,This is a very decent app. Two things I would like to see improved upon:,

But for the past two or three months the exercise counter has been running amok; I go for a 30-minute jog and it adds 1,100 calories! Or I do an ordinary, 20-minute walk and the calorie count is either unchanged or 1,200 calories higher! I have other, minor complaints about this app, but obviously it's useless if it doesn't correctly track or retain my exercise calories. I'm going to have to find an app that does.",

I have used MyFitnessPal in the past, and I prefer this app because of the design and ease of entering in my calories.

However, one of the first questions it asks is if you want to lose or gain weight. There is no option for maintaining weight. I'm a healthy weight and have no interest in changing it--I just wanted to be able to track my nutrition. I was forced to say that I wanted to lose/gain weight when that is not true. I feel like I'm being told that I should be unhappy with my body and aim to change it. After registering an account you are able to go in to settings and choose ""maintain weight"". There's no reason why this can't be an option while registering your account.",

I have to put each ingredient in as a portion of each recipe. I cannot seem to enter the whole recipe because it tells me that I have to ""share"" it even if it just a personal recipe and makes me put in how to make it, (200 words or more!) even though I know how to make it. Low carb taco salad for example, even if I were to share it I would hope that most people know low to make a taco.

Everything is free to use except a few unnecessary trackers. It has a database of every food I have eaten so far, and I like some strange stuff. It has made it very easy, for the first time, to stick to a healthy diet. Been using for a month now and lost 7 pounds, so I give it 5 stars.",
3635,5,2015-11-10T05:06:20.000Z,Ericag7,This app is fantastic.,This app is so convenient. Anything that you consume is pretty much on their list so you can keep accurate count on your consumed calories. It also has a scanner to scan your product and I have yet to find something that it does not recognize. This really keeps you accountable from food intake to excersise to keeping track of the water you've drank. It has so many features.,
3636,5,2016-03-17T18:22:29.000Z,LassLoves,Intuitive Food Tracking App,"This app is one of best tracking systems I have found -very intuitive and easy to use -love the scanning feature that pulls in the nutrition info of foods. The front page of the app provides a great mapping visual for %  of calories consumed by protein, carb, and fat. As it is compatible with the Apple Watch and phone apps for tracking activity, it pulls in number of calories 'burned' through activities. HIGHLY recommend!",
3637,5,2016-07-07T01:11:10.000Z,"...............,...,.,,,.",great app!,I love this app!! but one problem that occurs with calorie trackers like these is that they're often used by teens struggling with eating disorders and it can lead to an even worse relationship with food and stress over calories/macros. The support section is amazing in this app and offers kind advice and suggestions but it would definitely be helpful to find a way to make sure the app is being used in a healthy way :),
3638,5,2016-09-26T21:57:01.000Z,Landrycakes1,VERY GOOD APP,"i just got this app yesterday and i like it so much, it has a calorie tracker, and when you put in foods that you eat you can either search the food or put in the barcode which is very helpful, and also it has exercises that you can do and i counts the calories that you burn, and i also like the design of the app and it is easy to use.

It is so easy to use, allowing me to track both weight and exercise. And I even get to win rewards!! I will be using this app for a long time, even after I (hopefully) meet my weight loss goal!!",

It is a little annoying that when you  search for foods you get a lot of results for the same food with very differing nutritional info. You also build points by using the app, that you can cash in for gift cards etc. Some of the surveys you can fill in to earn points ask for information that seems to be oriented towards obtaining marketing info about you.",
3642,4,2012-09-22T02:39:48.000Z,1776news,Just what I wanted,"Great app. Intuitive. Has all the desired features, yet is easy to use. Yet there is one tiny (but annoying) bug. As expected the daily calorie allotment decreases as my weight decreases (which is good). The problem is that the calendar does not permanently retain my calorie needs for that day but instead compares my current daily needs against all dates. This has the demoralizing effect of turning all the past days red, implying that I failed to hit my goals in every previous day.",
3643,5,2012-11-25T01:58:12.000Z,Oster64,Simple to use,I have been using the lite version for just over a week. It is easy to track what you are eating since many of the food items or something close are listed in the extensive database. I use a heart rate monitor and like the exercise calorie tracker and the water tracker. Using this app has helped me make better food choices so far. Wish we could have a way to add items to the database.,

I've always used the Web version and just downloaded the app. It's great, but missing one of their most valuable tools: the complete nutrient breakdown. On the Web, I can see how much fat, sodium, sugar, etc., I'm getting in a day and adjust my diet accordingly. On the app I only get a general radio of fats, proteins and carbs.  If Livestrong would just add that function, they would have a perfect nutrition app.",

I work I'm a kitchen and a lot of times you don't have service in the kitchens on NYC so I have to wait til I'm out of work to track what I have eaten. But all in all not too bad. I've dropped about 7 pounds and I've been using this app for 10 days now. Great way to keep track of snacks, breakfast, dinner, water , etc. all in it's own category. Just need offline tracking and I'll be happy to give it five stars",

I've had a tremendous time managing enough calories and protein to maintain, gain, or cut weight.  This app makes it a snap.  I love that I can set my own calorie goals each day manually.  The barcode scan is also a great feature. And all you have to deal with are some minor advertisements at the bottom of the screen.  Well worth it.",

I wish it had all the components of the online tool that you can get for free in the app. Like the water tracker. You can keep track of how many glasses of water you've had for the day. Also, I would like to see them implement a scanning function on here. I also have the fitness pal and it's very convenient TI have that function. Overall a great tool, but there's a few things that can be done to make it better.",
3651,4,2014-03-09T12:12:59.000Z,Scribeo,An educational tool,"I like this apps a lot. It's not a new diet apps, it is just a nice tool to accompany you if you are on a diet. It allows you to realize what you are really eating in terms of calories and how healthy you eat and also how healthy you are with the exercice tracking too.",
3652,4,2014-05-15T16:12:42.000Z,Nuzcat,A few glitches but great app!,"My wife and I have been using this app for two weeks.  We love the carb/protein/fat ratio tab and the automatic import of our weight from our Withings scale!  Interface is very easy to use.  The few glitches we have noticed include a null value if you preview the nutritional information from a scanned food before you tell the app you ate it.  Also, website version seems to miss a lot when viewed online but the app is pretty solid.",
3653,5,2014-09-03T09:30:21.000Z,Gpr540,Very helpful,"I actually give this app most of the credit for my recent weight loss.  Easy enough to use, with very few problems.  I have found that the app and the website do not sync consistently, and the search function can be glitchy when my phone has less than ideal reception, but other than that the app has been incredibly useful.  Highly recommend.",
3654,5,2014-12-24T19:21:36.000Z,Josephine 59,Calorie Tracker,I really like this app especially with the update. It is easy to use. I like that I can scan some of the food I eat.  It does keep me accountable and shows me what foods/meals affect my weight. It also tracks my activity and I can put in exercises I've done. The only thing I find somewhat difficult is portion sizes. Short of weighing or measuring I sometimes just have to guess. But I think overall it works out.,
3655,4,2015-04-24T16:18:54.000Z,hanaoneill,Needs a recipe option,"I've used various apps for calorie counting, and this is by far the best one. The interface is the best and it's the easiest to use. My only complaint is that there is no option for creating a recipe and getting (or even entering manually) the nutrition information. I have had to use a separate website to calculate the nutritional information of my recipes and may even switch apps altogether if this becomes more of a problem for me.",
3656,4,2015-07-07T04:57:15.000Z,Friedl26,Better than the rest,"Easy to find foods. Displays three main macros in circle graphs. Historical data can be viewed in bar chart form including calories consumed. Viewing historical calories burned is a premium subscription feature. Some unique foods require manual input and other users inputs are returned in searches. Bar codes can be scanned for quick itemizing, however sometimes data is stale. Overall a better app than the competition due to its wide range of free features.",
3657,4,2016-02-26T20:55:55.000Z,Weeksla,Really helpful app,"This is a great app, and I use the scanning capability very often to help determine calorie count. It helps keep me accountable, and I have shared it with several friends. The one complaint I have, is that when you use two different devices to input your information, they do not always sync up. Also, it seems as though when I exercise more than once per day that the previous information from the same day gets deleted.",

It is also very simple to find an exercise or manually put in your own. I've had no hassles making sure I'm getting enough protein vs carbs and fat because it has a pie chart that shows you how your calories are distributed every day.",

I wish I could set a preference for foods by weight when searching the database. (I hate to dirty up a bunch of measuring cups, and I'm not an accurate estimator.) Also, it keeps describing my custom foods as ""one serving""--a completely arbitrary and useless phrase. I have it linked to the MyWater app, it would be nice if it recorded my fluid intake, not just the calories. STILL, I'm willing and able to use this app, so I'm calling it a WIN.",

You have to make multiple clicks to enter daily information for food (one used to be able to just click lunch, dinner, weight, etc., now you you have to click an initial ""track"" button. Why? This is a wasted of a button and time. It also doesn't track macros the same. It used to tell you how much you've consumed. Now it tells you what you still have yet to consume. There are days I have to change my macros and so it's important I know how many I've consumed. This change doesn't help. Don't buy this app. I'm probably moving to a new one myself.",

For me this was a huge disappointment as I use my Fitbit to track my activities. Fitbit is the most popular activity tracker so it just really doesn't make sense at all that the app isn't compatible with it. Very disappointed because I actually liked the app but had to go back to using the Lose it app so I can have my activity tracked from Fitbit to know exactly how many calories I burned during the day.","Hi Siunn! While we don't currently sync directly with Fitbit, the MyPlate app syncs with the Apple Health app and will import data from devices you've synced to that app already.

The ""0"" option is grayed out. Best you can hope for is reducing the exercise to one minute. But, that data still gets logged. Using the Community Board is useless and if there is a link to get technical support I wish you better luck than I had. I used to like this app but it has become more trouble than it us worth. Look elsewhere.","Hi DPinch1 - we're sorry you've had this experience. You actually can delete exercises that you've added by mistake.

However there has been a bad trend of the app sending notifications at odd hours outside of the meal logging reminders. The latest one came at 5:20 in the morning and when I contacted support they said ""turn your notifications off."" It seems that a quality app maker would not have their apps sending random notifications at bad times. Normally I would rate this app 5 stars but this notification problem and resulting customer service work against it.",

The one downside is it doesn't recognize supplements when scanning and/or searching. I take mass gainer to aid in gaining weight, building muscle, and getting stronger; and when I scanned the barcode on my mass gainer bucket, it didn't recognize it, so I had to manually input the nutrition information.

The previous one included house cleaning, mowing, laundry, and all the day to day things that I do. It was nice to keep track of exactly everything I was doing. The updates version does not include any of that, or even simple, basic exercise tasks. I hope that everyday tasks like that can be added to the exercise options.

I have lost about a pound a week for four months. I learned the hard way to keep track of my basal metabolism, and keep my daily calorie count higher than my basal. The app doesn't track that for you. Valuable app, even if you don't cash in your reward points (I do.)",

I just choose manual and put in the amount from the machine. I use all recipes (paid version) to plan meals and have a grocery list. I can get the calories for each serving from my allrecipes app and enter it into the food app that way. Love the combo of the two!!,

Not only does it allow you to track calories but also allows you to track your macronutrients in the process. The only complaint I have is the percentages of fat protein and carbohydrates are incorrect. Most of the time it is reading off a much greater or lower percentage then what the numbers calculate out to.,

That's not what I needed, which is why I picked this app AND paid for gold status in the first place. The tracking is more convoluted and the pie chart which showed your daily percentages for fat, protein and carbs on your home page is gone. AWFUL update. You might have asked for user input before changing it. If I could get a refund on what I paid I would ask for it. Now I have to find another tracking app.",
3705,4,2017-03-13T18:15:00.000Z,1_country_boyBRS,Ease of Use,The app is easy to use for me. It has just about everything I need to keep track of my caloric intake for building muscle mass. The only reason why I'm giving it four stars is because the workout feature only gives a select few workouts to do and they don't really isolate any particular section of your muscles without having to pay for an upgrade to get the more isolated muscle building workouts.,

At first I was using the activity tracker but it wasn't accurate enough for me. So I just calculated my own calories burned with a formula from runners world. (Weight in lbs x .57 for walking and x .72 for running.) I also like that as your weight goes down, the daily calories allowed goes down with it. Great tool!",

For example my brother and I have this app on different device. I found out that I don't consume enough calories every day. My brother found out that his breakfast lunch and dinner calories combined is only half of how many calories he consumes for snacks. As I have demonstrated it is a very helpful app,

Sometimes I forget to log my exercises until after midnight but it will only allow you to look at the previous day but not enter information. Another problem it saves everything so if you enter something wrong on a food item you're stuck with the mistake sine the software won't allow you to delete anything you've entered once it's submitted.

That equals 120g of carbs a day. I entered in a banana and Chobani yogurt for breakfast, which the app correctly lists as 30g in total.... but it is telling me I'm already at 40% of my daily carbs?? That's not right... it should say 25%... basic math is not strong with this app, and basic carb counting is clearly glitched. I tried erasing and re-downloading... Same thing. I like everything else but if something as basic as carb counting is off by that much this all is useless. I hope others are over-doing or undergoing their carbs and trusting this app.",

My only question, is the exercise portion seems to be off. I use MapMyRide and I bike ride 20 miles per day in 1 hour 10 min and My plate says much more calories burned than MapMyRide so I go with MapMyRide numbers.  My Plate likely needs to revisit their calorie counts for exercise.  This works so well for my needs, I do love it!",

I have no idea how many calories or fat is in a vegan tuna sandwich. So it's hard for me to say I had a vegan tuna sandwich. These kinds of apps are great for people who are eating out of boxes or restaurants. And what I really like about this app is that I can repeat stuff that I have every single day. That is wonderful but it is hard for me to say everything that I eat!,Hello and thank you for your review!

Lately it hasn't been syncing between my phone and iPad though which makes it pretty useless. If I can't look back a few days to see totals (right now it shows a total of 800 cal on my phone and 400 on my iPad bc they aren't synced) or use the graphing I paid for, it doesn't do me much good.

Seems to happen most often when you change a serving size from anything but 1.00, but all crashes are related to calculation of calories.  Bit silly when that's the entire purpose of the program.  Also I can't figure out how to change your calorie goal once it is set, but that's probably user error.   If they can fix the crashing, then I would gladly rate it 5 Stars.",

For example mowing the lawn in 97 degrees weather am I suppose to use gardening for that?? Then walking while pushing a stroller showed less cal burned than just the walking one.

3812,5,2013-09-11T14:36:02.000Z,Dr. Feelgood1913,Lifesaver!!!,My Plate has been a lifesaver for me! I realize that the key to losing weight & staying healthy is 70% diet & 30% exercise. My Plate gives me the opportunity to track both. I love all of the different features of the app & how it will remind me if I don't track my food one day. It's my accountability partner & has definitely helped me to lose weight & make better food choices. Thanks!,
3813,5,2014-01-05T18:54:40.000Z,Cottensoccer12,Must have this app!!,If you are trying to loose weight and need a little help THIS APP IS FOR YOU!! I'm 13 and if I can use it I think you can too! It really breaks everything down. It gives you a amount of calories after typing in your weight and height and it gives you more calories when you work out their is also a lot more cool features DEFIANTLY my favorite app!,
3814,3,2014-01-23T16:13:36.000Z,GymRatWP,Needs more exercises in search and calories left,"Fairly good. I like the concept and most features but wish it would do two things that it does NOT do. 1.) Show calories eaten in a total number, not just what's been used of  the bar. 2.) Show more exercises in search. I can't find CrossFit, cardio, HIT, high intensity. medium intensity, or intervals. I do NOT do static cardio and you burn WAY more calories than this thing shows when you try to track HIT training. The same will go for a mix of weights and cardio.",
3815,5,2014-06-20T03:18:02.000Z,Bethany Stenger,Overall great app,"There've been a few technical glitches with the most recent update (food search showing no results) but overall I've really enjoyed this app and have been using it a long time. The foods I want are almost always in there which is great, and it's super easy to add new ones. It's also very intuitive and user friendly.",
3816,5,2016-05-11T18:11:27.000Z,kingsgrl54,Awesome,Best diet tracker ever. Highly recommend !!!!   If you are serious about tracking your food and nutrition this is the app you want.  I was able to see that I was not getting enough protein and then easily made adjustments.  I love the ability to track my workouts and see it taken off the total calories.  Get this app. You won't be disappointed!,
3817,5,2016-07-13T19:13:53.000Z,Lallen2882,Can't be beat,I've used this website since before it was with Livestrong - It was The Daily Plate (2006). It keeps getting better!  The app has gone through a LOT of changes and I'm finally happy with it.,
3818,5,2017-01-12T20:09:14.000Z,Katie Scarabino,BEST THING EVER,Many many workout apps kick me off once it knows I'm only 17 and thinks I'm to young to be participating. However I work out regularly and I'm trying to lose some weight so I wanted a way of tracking it. Also if I lie about my age it then won't work right because it's not true. I appreciate that MyPlate let's me on at 17 tremendously also it awesome! This app is perfect and allows a lot for free.,
3819,5,2017-05-16T18:55:22.000Z,mcasdfaf,"Easy, concise, exactly what I was looking for","The ability to scan barcodes to add to my food diary is such a great plus. I love the ease of the main interface. You touch Lunch, you log lunch and hit done. Now you see you lunch button change color and you calorie consumption right under it. Such a intelligent way of tracking. My favorite app in this category by far.",
3820,4,2012-10-01T14:45:33.000Z,Scorchress,Really good,"I have used FitnessPal, Calorie Count and this app to track my food and water. This meets all my needs in regards to adding  nutrition for special foods a well as keeping track of water consumption. I wis it ha a barcode reader like FitnessPal, but I love the options to see a pie chart of the nutritional breakdown I've eaten that day as well as being able to set my daily calorie intake lower than 1200 (I was gaining weight w the other apps that didn't track lower than 1200).",
3821,3,2013-01-08T19:34:12.000Z,Lydialoo1234567,The features need some updates,"I love the app because when it finds my exercise or food I ate, it accurately puts it in. However, it doesn't have any weight lifting calorie counters or plyometric/HIIT calorie counters so its hard to estimate my own calorie burning. Love how you can add a food or sandwich in and refer to it later in the week if you consume it again without having to go through each and every food in that sandwich or meal. Great app, helpful tips And tools, great for anyone with a New Years weight losing resolution!",
3822,4,2013-06-28T18:27:09.000Z,docwolf1,Good app,Overall like the app. A few bugs-sometimes foods you eat all the time are not listed in frequently or recently eaten. Example romaine lettuce. But foods that I had once are listed. Also on the lite version you cannot go back on previous days and check out your nutrient breakdown. Again overall I like the app and it has helped me lose weight and have a better grasp of my diet and its components. Easy to use!,
3823,5,2014-03-06T19:49:43.000Z,Angelrae1022,Convenient & easy to use,This app really helps me keep track of my diet and exercise. Most foods are already loaded so all you have to do is sometimes adjust the serving you ate. I like the fact that this also has Livestrong verified calorie counts which makes me more confident than random people adding calorie counts and not being sure if they are accurate.,
3824,2,2014-03-27T12:19:36.000Z,M..E..C,It used to be great!  Now it's just okay.,"I love the fact that this app is a one stop shop for tracking food, exercise and water!!  It also boasts a huge database of food for you to search which I love!  But - it crashes, it changes the custom foods I have in there in terms if calories/fat/protein/carbs, and the custom recipes function is not used friendly. The scan function only finds my foods like a quarter of the time but I eat paleo so most of my foods don't have a label. Overall, I still use it but I don't expect much and don't rely on custom foods or recipes.",
3825,4,2014-04-19T16:07:58.000Z,ncc2279,Good app with potential to be great,"I've been using this app for about a month. It has been a great help in managing the calories I take in as well as to see what eating patterns I have. A few suggestions - it would be nice to be able to convert 'manual' foods into custom foods. I would also like a more flexible exercise section to put in exercise intensity. As states in other reviews, is like the option to omit exercise calorie burn from my total intake.",
3826,5,2015-01-23T12:50:36.000Z,DLMiller49,Great App!,"I've been using this App for two years. It helped me lose 32 pounds when I first started two years ago. Now, it helps me maintain my weight, and when things get a little wonky, like right after the holidays, it helps me get back on track eating the way I should. It's easy to use, and almost all the food I've needed to list has been found!",
3827,4,2015-01-26T21:05:23.000Z,Anna Fontus,"Great, but needs tweaks","I think it's a great app, more and more foods are added which makes it more attractive for use. Couple improvements I'd like to see: for notifications, I like them, but it's frustrating to keep getting ""track your breakfast"" etc. several times after I've already done so. Secondly, motion sensors are getting better for running, but could use fine tuning :) thanks and keep up the good work!",
3828,4,2015-03-16T07:35:08.000Z,Queen Natasha,"Great except ""community""","This ap is great for tracking! It's EZ, fast & accurate. But the ""community"" is full of negative know it alls who will blatantly post put-downs as an answer to your question. Only about half the people are actually supportive. The rest act like their the sh!t. The worst part is there is no way to block these posters. If that was possible I'd give it a 5 star! Beware people, there's plenty of novice haters in the ""community!"" Thumbs down to their social support!",
3829,4,2016-01-18T17:03:40.000Z,Imaginazian,Great Tracker,I'm a personal trainer and I recommend this app to my clients all the time to help them keep track of their daily nutrition.  It keeps them accountable and also helps me see what their eating on a day to day basis without making things overly complicated. Only thing that I wished this app had is a feature for my clients to message their daily intake to me without having to screenshot it. Otherwise great and easy to use app.,
3830,5,2013-07-29T02:38:52.000Z,Tara Ciriello,Awesome - much easier than expected!,"This is exactly what I was looking for.  Every fitness guru will tell you how important it is to write down what you eat, but it feels like such a hassle.  Now we have no excuse -- a cell phone is always at the table! Counts the calories for you... really always you to see where you are struggling in your daily diet. Love and recommend this app!",
3831,5,2013-09-15T07:20:10.000Z,Angels&Apples,Best App for keeping in track.,This is the best app for me because I've been loosing weight since I've started two weeks ago. Even if I don't exercise like I used to. Turns out I'm just having mindless snacking. This apps made me aware of that and helps me plan my food in a day so that I won't over eat.i It is very easy to use. and I have lost at least 5 lbs. since I've started.,
3832,5,2014-01-27T03:28:59.000Z,Maggiemmmmmmmm,Best calorie counting app!!!!!!,"I've tried this app and the Calorie Counter app and this one is far better! It has a clean simple fun design and great features like progress and achievements and a scanner for foods. It knows the nutrition for every food I eat and it shows a pie chart of each thing for its protein, carbs, and fat so I'm learning about what I eat too! This really helps me keep motivated, thanks livestrong!",

It's an excellent app for its maturity stage! Once I got it, I intuitively knew what to do. And I immediately felt like I had found the best approach for me to count daily calorie intake without having to write it down a piece of paper. Fun to use, makes you want to use it!",
3835,2,2014-12-08T01:33:12.000Z,Shari Saneda,Used to be awesome... Not anymore,"I have used this app for six months. I've been very happy with the tracking that I can do with this application. About two months ago it begin to freeze up and I would have to reboot my iPad to get the app to work. Today the app froze and I lost six months worth of data. It did keep my profile information but food custom food menus and past records are gone. At the end of the day today I reentered on my daily information it froze and I lost today's information. This app is a goner, sorry to say.",
3836,5,2015-01-10T15:39:10.000Z,Mark Tatara,Recommend to all my patients,App is flawless and easy to use without prior instructions.  I am an internist and recommend calorie tracking to all of my overweight patients who struggle or give up out of frustration if they can't lose weight with just good intention to simply eat less. Put some numbers to it!  Guaranteed to work!  Engineers and accountants love this sort of thing.,
3837,5,2015-07-07T15:58:02.000Z,Oqws,Best all encompassing health app,"It tracks exercise and calories, pairs with apps and data from your phone. So when I go for a walk or jog I don't even need to enter it... It's automatic. The calorie counter is easy and clean and pretty... But it tracks so much more and gives me info to see when and how I'm eating more carbs, fats, proteins.. It breaks it down into visually appealing graphs. It's a great tool for a healthy life.",

I tried to log in to my account all morning, but it just got stuck on ""syncing"" forever and never went anywhere. I tried re-downloading the app, logging in through Facebook, and even tried setting up a new account because I really need the app ASAP. But alas, it had this same issue with ""registering"" and wouldn't let me register. I loved this app before, but I'm not going to waste my time all day on this stupid thing anymore. I'm finding something else.",
3840,4,2012-08-31T13:00:18.000Z,MeganM1986,Good app just one error,"Really enjoy this app! Easy to track and reminders are helpful. Just one problem I've run into, when I reduced the amount to a fraction of the singular portion, sometimes it doesn't divide the calories correctly. On a couple occasions, I've ended up tracking less calories than I was supposed to. Also, I haven't yet figured out how to edit something once it's logged, but maybe that's just me.",
3841,5,2012-10-30T06:25:35.000Z,Sarahl.jo,An awesome app!,"I have used this app for the last three weeks and absolutely love it! It is very easy to use, and helps you track calories, weight, and daily exercise. The only thing that could make this app better is if it helped track daily servings of veggies, fruit, protein, etc, along with calorie intake. I would definitely recommend this app to a friend!",
3842,4,2015-02-19T01:46:28.000Z,Fit > Skinny,I love this app.,"This app is amazing. It tracks food, exercises, water intake, and even has a point system within the app to earn fitness gear. (It takes a while though to rack those points!) I am in love with it. The only thing I would change is the accuracy of nutritional facts. I had to change and manually put in a lot of foods because most facts were not accurate. Other than that, it's really fun and great.",
3843,5,2015-03-10T20:05:11.000Z,MunishHazrati,Awesome,"Awesome app (from the view of a fourteen year old) the best part is that you can just scan items instead of searching for them.....I chose the lose 1.5 lbs per week option and basically lost like 0.5 pounds a day....Also, I didn't do this thing on weekends an already lost like 6 pounds in two weeks. Seriously, get this app to lose weight.",

3846,5,2016-03-18T02:09:41.000Z,Morganabelletrix414,So Good,This app is probably the best for counting calories and keeping track of weight.

However, when it came time to add a custom food item, that feature only worked about one third of the time. When it did work? Great! But for the most part it didn't and I was met with repeated error messages or I would input all of the necessary data but only a couple of values (i.e. fat, carbs) would show up while the other info I entered wasn't processed. I've probably burned 100 calories by just yelling at this app. Despite that, I'll be deleting it now.",
3848,4,2017-08-16T04:30:49.000Z,Swelligan,Comprehensive App,"You get a lot of features for free with this app.  What won me over was the exercise feature.  It can tell how many calories you burned anywhere from daily activities like mowing the lawn and gardening to focused exercise like running, walking, and biking.  Plus it includes workout videos.","Hi Swelligan - Thank you for your review! To edit or delete a tracked exercise, please scroll down the main page of the app, tap on the exercise you've mistakenly entered. The option to edit or delete that tracked item will appear.

If I sat back and guessed how many calories, fats, proteins, carbs, etc. I consumed in a day, I would definitely underestimate the amount and wonder why my weight isn't budging.  This gives me a clear view from day to day and even meal to meal.  If I overdid it at breakfast--lunch, dinner and snacks would be adjusted to meet my goal for the day.  The down side, yes, it crashes from time to time.",
3852,4,2013-08-05T16:46:43.000Z,MD272727,Not bad,Pretty good app. Has most food items when you search. If they don't have it within the search you can simply add it yourself easily. The only downside so far is the app crashes a lot! At least once or more times a day.,

I should be able to track 1/8 of that meal or 1/4 of that meal etc. each time I want to track it. Currently, I can create a meal for the whole pizza but have to manually reset each ingredient to 1/4, for example.",

Loved the way you could track calories, macronutrients, water, and have everything right there. With the recent update, that has all changed. It is very difficult to track macronutrients now, and in order to see everything, you have to scroll through the app. It used to all be in a box at the top of the screen. I'm not sure why they felt the need to change the app, but they completely ruined it. I will be looking for a new app to use.",

Takes extra taps to track, used to see %of carbs, protein, and Fat. Now you only see what's left and the total you've consumed....much preferred percentage. After using this app religiously, I sad to say I am going to look for a new one that works the way this app used to work. Why fix what wasn't broken.

I like that you can select your level of activity. It would be helpful if the exercise was precise in the same way, custom calculating the calories burned for the body type and level of exertion. When I add foods I always have to round because their is no decimal point, which is irritating. It's a great app and I will stick with it until I find something more accurate.",

The app keeps changing my weight, adding 100 lbs or more, and this morning, turned me into a man. Syncing every day, or more often, isn't helping, and this is definitely going to mess up the trends.

Also for ""activity level"" it doesn't give descriptions like ""very active means you workout 6-7 days a week for __ amt of time"" so you have to guess.",

A reasonably priced one-time fee might be acceptable, but I can't tell if that's even an option.  I will continue to use CalorieKing's desktop software and delete this frustrating app.",

It's never lost my input after crashing, though, so it's more just an inconvenience. I think the calorie reductions of the exercise is somewhat inflated too, but that could be the difference between their version of ""vigorous"" and mine, lol. Overall pretty good.",
4003,4,2013-08-09T15:14:23.000Z,Kdsteach,Love it,I've found this to help me immensely truly know what I'm eating and drinking. It's a good visual of your day. You have to really look at the foods you're choosing to add because people can add them in and the nutritional content may not be correct. Only improvement I would make is to see a complete nutritional breakdown on one screen at the end of the day. My fitness pal does this. Overall HUGE help to me.,

If you are trying to track macros(protein, carb, fat percentage) this update will not work easily for you because the pie chart that shows % of those things is gone. (App Store images show the old layout) now there are gram markers to show your intake but it doesn't do much good unless you are a math wiz while trying to keep 40% of your intake at proteins or what not.

It's easy to use, and there is a large database of food so that I rarely need to enter data manually. I like the presentation of graphs and stats.  More than once App has lost all data and I've had to uninstall and reinstall to recover the data - I think it's pulling my archived info from the Livestrong website.",

Not that this has anything to do with function, but I also like he layout better. It looks more appealing and less boring.",

Some annoying bugs though cause the program to close spontaneously. Haven't used other similar programs, so I can't compare, but this one meets my needs for now.

And the gold membership is a complete rip off! You pay for nothing! They offer a refund in the first 30days, however if you purchase through iTunes or google play you can't get the refund! And there is no way to just purchase a month membership it automatically makes you buy the one year! There are other better apps that offer more for free!!",

Now with recent updates, if I eat something at lunch and scan it in,  it's not available in the list when I go to enter what I had for dinner the next day... only for lunch. Don't the people that write this software used the app? Why would I have to put something in multiple times?",

Like  that you can add in your exercise, and of course use on smartphone as well as home computer. Didn't see much value in the water tracker.  Found the nutrient analysis a little off, when I knew I had eaten the RDA of Vitamin A the daily summary showed I had only eaten a fraction of the RDA, hence was not altogether convinced of accuracy.",

4083,4,2015-01-08T06:45:08.000Z,Fish2558,Love,Love everything about this app! My only complaint is that I wish there was a larger database for fast foods...panera etc and more items from Walmart and Aldi to scan from...just takes a long time to fine the information and out it in manually...overall this is the best app I've come across and it's not annoying and is very user friendly!,

Very frustrating! It works well with Apple's Health app but it inaccurately adds ALL of the calories from all the other exercise apps you may be using, including iPhone's own tracker.",
4085,5,2015-07-09T01:34:20.000Z,lacksanickname,My plate review,Works very well.  Would be even better if the apps in iPad and iPhones would interconnect.  Now you can keep up with information in one but you must enter at least the totals in the other since they don't communicate.  I end up keeping data on the iPhone and entering totals only in the iPad.,

MyPlate helps me be on top of everything I eat throughout the day and let's me see the good and bad sides of all the foods I eat. Also very convenient being that it's on my phone and I can scan or add the foods not on here. Great app.",

Health is not just about calories and that's addressed somewhat. I would LOVE to see servings of fruits and vegetables in the daily summary. Not all carbs are the same and so much research show how vitally important these are. It would be a perfect app with this simple addition!,

It's easier for me to track the calories that way. Either way it's still a great app.,

4096,5,2016-04-20T19:32:55.000Z,Sara dipite,Really great!!,I love this app. As someone who is really active it is helpful to track how much I'm eating because I usually don't eat enough to sustain how much i work out. I really like that you can add how much water and how much of a serving you have. And the scanning feature is really convenient. Anyone can benefit from this app.,
4097,3,2016-05-22T00:15:59.000Z,Killtrend,BIG flaw,"The app SHOULDN'T ask for user submitted calories, it should do the math. All these idiots adding calories for us to plug in don't do the math and apparently can't read. They put 290g of fat instead of 29 and completely threw me off when I was trying to figure out how things didn't add up.",

It makes you look through a list with entries that are loaded with errors (especially the user submitted entries).  When I've tried to enter my own the ""quick add"" is too simple and the create new food feature does not save the information I've entered correctly. Food adding issues aside, it's a basic calorie and macro tracker, not fancy.",

But I think the app is missing an over all daily nutrition total in grams as well as percentage. I'd like to see more than just my macro nutrient intake. Also, I had issue scanning a few simple items like oat meal and honey. Overall, I love the Stronger web workouts and love how it is all integrated with the app. I just think that the app could use a few extra things. :)",

I can't figure out how to just add on to an amount I've already consumed. Please bring back the ability to simply type in an ounce amount.",

I really like how you can choose your general activity level.  I had a week where I was medically confined to the couch and it identified the difference in the calories I needed!   This has helped keep me honest and keep my weight from trending up!,

This is one area that needs attention. Other calorie trackers I looked at do sync but I chose Livestrong because the social media has to be clicked on special to access.

I won't eat any more calories than before but the information won't be accurate (it will always tell me I have calories to spare) and I'm annoyed that it won't let me decide for myself the number of calories I should eat. It was perfect the way it was. Not happy with the update.,

4135,4,2015-02-12T19:03:24.000Z,Red 001,Great But Needs More Work!,What a great app. The simplicity of the interface is brilliant. I love opening this app. LiveStrong should put more effort into cleaning up the nutritional info. on the foods that users have logged. Less repeat items and more verification. Example: I logged 5 cherry tomatoes and my sodium levels went from 68% to 128%. What? Fix some things like this and it'll be an amazing app.,

I would recommend!,

And it is motivating/interesting to see how the meals and snacks play out. The only thing I don't like is that it isn't detailed in monitoring my nutrients. I would like to see my levels of wellness and not only count calorie/fat. Maybe the upgrade shows this?,

I like being able to see my calories and protein, but saturated fat would be nice!  My biggest complain is that there isn't a big enough database for the exercises. Maybe they can change it to look like Nexercise so we know what exercises are available to record.",
4143,3,2013-05-24T00:12:38.000Z,(&Sam&),I'm assuming the paid version is better...,This app doesn't let you select any preset exercises. How would I know how many calories I've burnt from walking/jogging/swimming??  Other apps like this usually allow you to select the amount of time and the intensity with which you worked out and then gives an estimate of calories burned.  I'm glad it does give breakdowns for what percent of carbs/fat/protein you have in your diet.,

Needs a option to stay logged in always. Won't login using Facebook even though it's been authorized connected. It's a hassle.

I like to track my vitamins and meds. It would be great if there was a section for this that would take ""0"" for the calories for some meds.

Example if you ate a tuna sandwich at home, you cannot put what type of bread you ate it with or how much condiments you added to it. They have a database of food that is already in there and you can only choose from their list which is stupid!! Unless I am doing something wrong...",

Still not as good as it used to be! C'mon, do they even read these?

One thing I would like to know is the specifics such as how many grams of protein have I taken in. How many grams of fat have I taken in. The percentages are good but I think it could add the actual. Maybe in an update.,
4235,5,2014-01-11T21:51:01.000Z,BandGeek723,Fantabulous!,I really like it! It's pretty user-friendly and quick to use. I also enjoy the scan feature for food items with barcodes. It'd be nice if more items were in the system (when scanning) but the content is pretty extensive as it is.,
4236,4,2014-02-03T14:50:05.000Z,Kodeysmom,Great app. Needs some updates,Really love this app. One of the best food trackers. I also utilize the online page with meal suggestions and exercise.

The exercise feature that subtracts calories burned annoys me since calories are burned just walking across the room but not counted in the calcs. Fortunately this feature can be turned off.

The amounts can jump more than 10 grams from one option to another. It would be really nice to have the numbers remaining instead of showing only what is consumed. The scan option is so small you can hardly see it. The choices for amount consumed is also very limited.,

But once you've entered a few of your ""regularly eaten"" food items it's easy to select them again. The point collection system is a little annoying.

4300,4,2012-04-05T17:55:14.000Z,Metro Cowboy,Well designed App,Very helpful for day to day meal planning and weight control. The nutrient tracker during the day is great for learning about balancing food groups. The only thing keeping it from four stars is the lack of source information as to who submitted the calorie choice and how the food was prepared to make the calorie count different from other like foods.,

I will log in what I have planned to eat and add/delete things the next day if things change. I'm also following a weight loss paleo keto diet and seeing the ((percentages)) of my caloric breakdown is vital. Since you changed it to grams vs percentage, it's practically useless.

They do not have all of the brands of food or drinks that you may buy, so you have to either look up your item online to find the calories or you have to pick something from the trackers list.

I failed to use it several days due to frustration. Come up with a better way to search for your foods and activities.  Make so you just type in 2 slices home made banana bread. Biked 2  miles  etc.  I like what your attempting but if it's too frustrating nobody  will recommend it to friends. And your out,

4345,4,2015-06-18T03:09:33.000Z,Cutelg,For your consideration.,"I really like this app, I find it very useful. I would have given it a 5 but I really want for an alternative beverage tracker too, juice, tea, coffee and even though I drink nothing carbonated beer and soda too. I think if you are really tracking EVERYTHING you eat or drink you have to be honest but it's easier to have a place to track it BESIDES a meal or snack area.",
4346,5,2015-08-15T21:16:55.000Z,Darknessconsumesme@icloud,Gold Member,I'm a gold member and have loved this app from the start. The app helps you take a good look at what your eating and what your portion sizes are. I also love that it can be linked to my workout app and subtracts those calories to overall tell me how many calories I have left to consume.,
4347,4,2015-09-24T00:30:47.000Z,Justconfess,Great App,If you are a serious health foodie or a casual one trying to get serious about what goes into their body (like me) you will love this app.,

No nutritional info beyond fat, carbohydrates, and protein pie chart.  Also, food search window is cumbersome, non intuitive and hard to use.  It is unnecessarily small and cuts off long food names and then closes unexpectedly while you are searching.  It literally took me 3 tries to look up greek yogurt.  Maybe the paid version is better?",

4358,5,2014-11-16T05:55:58.000Z,ziswarts,Perfect,This app is the go to calorie tracker in my opinion. It works well with tracking calories burned and with my Nike run app I usually don't have to worry about that too much. Majority of foods are already on there so tracking intake shouldn't be difficult for anyone. Highly recommended!,

I travel a lot, though, and have lived abroad for more than half of the 2 years.

This is the first time I successfully lost weight! I wish the app had other features (some of which come in the paid for version) but the important thing is I got the results I wanted.,
4424,5,2013-08-01T19:20:23.000Z,Pegsweet,Simple and easy to use,I have tried 2 other calorie counting apps and this one is my favorite. It is simple and very easy to use. It takes only a couple of minutes at most to log the days intake. It eave gives a reminder if I forget. I like it a lot.,

What really knocked it down for me was that I paid for Gold and it said I could turn of auto-renewing in the settings, but they actually hid that setting out of the app. There are several design decisions like this that give the user less control than desired.",

It has great goals for specific diets and how you want your body to transform. My complaint is that there is always an add in front of where it lists my macronutrients for the day. Seeing as how I count my macros, this is quite annoying. If this is fixed, then I would rate this app 5 stars.",

The best part is it divides my food intake into protein , fat and carbs. As I'm using this app to reduce my weight so it helps me to measure my grams of carbs in daily routine. It would be so good if you add more food from India / Pakistan so I can track them easily .",
4446,5,2015-05-14T21:20:24.000Z,Steve Mande,Great app but would like to see more features,I use the iPhone app every day to stay on course and love it.

I like that it syncs with your iPhone's step monitor, however, I find that it keeps going back down to 0 calories burned or smaller number after I've seen it track 700 caliries burned from exercise. Fix this bug and I'd give it a 4. The food entry part isn't perfect, but it's good enough.",

Maybe is somethings cultural I mean in the US they have dinner at 18:00, Latin's,  much later and at 17/18 ""merienda"". Positive is it has many dishes in Spanish too, does not means only translation but the kind of meals.",

However it would mean a lot for me if I could track my BG here as well as I dislike most of the diabetic apps. It does what I now consider the basics which is more than I ever realized was necessary but it is not in depth or customizable enough. And the app doesn't have all the features of the online version!?!?!?,

Six and a half months of hard work records gone!  And now they taken down all the customer reviews about that issue.,

4513,3,2013-06-24T19:15:01.000Z,scliver,Close but not quite,"Love the design and layout. Chose this one over my fitness pro because of that and because it counts the calories you burn when you lift weights. When entering your meals, the search results are confusing and, a lot of the time, wrong. Would be nice if it also calculated your fiber intake and you could use the decimal point when entering in foods manually.",
4514,4,2013-07-04T15:21:03.000Z,art's chili,Great app,Using this to track my diabetic diet as I make post partum adjustments.  This is a great app.  It's easy to personalize and I've had no trouble with it crashing or bogging down my phone.  The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because some of the food listings are not correct or do not agree with the industry standard in the diabetic and diatetic meal planning guide.,
4515,4,2013-08-15T14:09:37.000Z,Smitty145,Add Water Amounts!,Overall I love this app. Really helps me decide what to eat and see the exercise pay off. But the water tracker is pretty pointless cause you can either choose mL or oz. I mean really... I either have to do the math with ounces or have something like 5000 milliliters. How about quarts or liters being an option for the non-sippers to use please?,

It asks if you did one of the exercises it recommends or to input your calories burned. So I have to use a different website to figure that out.,

Everything is slow, sometimes the app glitches and there are no other buttons when you press track. The bar to show how many calories is constantly incorrect, and overall just horrible. Will be deleting this app after this.","Hi Gengen9- We apologize that you're not happy, and thank you for your feedback regarding out latest update.

Nor can you download your own recipe to be calculated without putting every food item in individually.  For that reason, I rate it a 3. It's very important to me to use a recipe from the web especially.","Hi Beaoct29, we're so sorry that you're not happy with the app. We will definitely pass your feedback on to our team for consideration in future updates!

4530,3,2012-04-13T02:17:26.000Z,Vnash23,Decent,The functionality of this app is nice however I find that some of the foods are missing pertinent nutritional information.  This could be due to the inability to enter some nutritional values when using this app to enter new foods.  This is important to me in particular because I need to track sodium intake and that is one of the values that are not available when adding items.,

This allowed me to modify the amount or find an alternative. It also lets me keep track of cals burned working out!!! Great!!!,
4568,3,2014-03-12T07:39:45.000Z,JessicaLT,Ok but could use some fixes,"Some basic foods are searchable in the app but others require the user to input the calorie, fat, and protein content. It's a little extra work than I was looking for. Also, if you don't get all of your food info input the same day, the app doesn't have the option to go back. It only shows the current day.",
4569,3,2014-04-02T18:25:31.000Z,devospice,Latest update crashes on launch every time.,"I've been using this app for a while and I love it, but the latest update has caused constant crashing. Every time (and I mean literally every single time) I launch the app it freezes for 3 seconds then crashes. Then when I relaunch it it works. It doesn't make the app unusable but it's aggravating.",
4570,5,2012-04-21T13:46:24.000Z,Kshe4444,Love it!,I started using this app about two weeks ago. I have lost six pounds just by being accountable for what I eat. The food diary is so easy to use and has just about everything I have put in pops up. I have been recommending it to everyone.,
4571,5,2012-09-24T13:27:26.000Z,HelixileH,Simple & works,I've been using it for months and I've lost weight each week. As a vegan I'm impressed at the extensive database of foods. I've quit other similar apps because I was tired of always entering my vegan food manually. That rarely happens with this app.,
4572,4,2016-04-04T11:34:19.000Z,Kdog1112,Great app,Over the last three years I have lost 110 pounds!  This app has been the best I have found at tracking nutrition and exercise.  Would have given a 5 star rating if it was more current with video exercises like the Beachbody line.  They are the most modern form of exercise for busy parents.,

4575,4,2016-08-21T21:15:46.000Z,aobarose,Needs to let us edit and add food,"While i love this app, it has limits. You cant change calorie info if its no longer correct. You can't add a restaurant item if you can't find it. Also a lot of the images are totally random! Chips have ramen pics, tuna just has a weightwatchers logo, etc.",
4576,4,2016-10-18T00:58:55.000Z,Stacer53,I like the reminders,"I like to use the push noticed because it's super helpful in reminding me to track food. I feel like there should be more ""homemade"" food options I don't eat out or cook from a box or package very often so I feel my meals are less salt and fat than is being recorded. But I do like the app.",

4578,1,2017-03-12T19:58:33.000Z,Ckadz11246,Hate the update,"As many previous reviews have stated, I used to love this app before the update. I loved the way I could track my carbs, protein and fat for the day on a user friendly pie chart. Now the app only tells me what I have left for the day, which means I have no way of quickly knowing how many grams I've eaten if I go over. I'm guessing they switched so people would upgrade to gold but it's ridiculously overpriced. I'll be deleting this and switching to something else.",
4579,5,2017-06-01T19:32:33.000Z,Jake Demon,Great App,This app is the best fitness tracking app I've used. I did not like the clunky myFitPal counter. This app is simplistic and has a great UI. Barcode scanners really wowed me.,
4580,4,2015-06-11T17:01:20.000Z,JuleLehua,Very user friendly,"I switched to this one after the everyday health app crashed on me.  It is much easier to use, but I would like to see a sugar tracking feature with all the other nutritional info.  And that is the only reason for four stars instead of five.",

4583,3,2015-10-07T17:05:04.000Z,wydescreen,It's okay.,"What really holds this back for me is the inability to keep track of average caloric intake.  You can do it, for a price.  Otherwise I'd still be using the app.  It works as well as the others, but I just can't get past a developer showing that an option is available (greyed out option) for a monthly fee.  Yes, I know they're trying to make money.",
4584,5,2015-11-10T01:54:53.000Z,the_9th,The App is Back,I had given up on the app earlier this year. Multiple issue made it unusable. Now that I am back I am loving it.

4585,5,2015-12-19T01:52:03.000Z,huntad,Easy and fun to use,This has always been my favorite calorie counting/ nutrition app. It has and easy and fun to use interface. The only complaint I had was not enough foods in the data base but it looks like they have improved much. Great app!,

Like I have to wait for the little green box to pop up when Ive searched the food 3 different times and it's clearly not in the system.. There should be a button for me to add my food right away.. Other than that I really love it.,
4587,5,2016-01-22T03:03:29.000Z,-zb,Easy and Accurate,Love having this app on the phone. very useful for being aware of where you are at for daily nutrition.  you can find most anything you eat here and track progress accurately with ease.,
4588,4,2016-03-14T04:57:19.000Z,1amdeev,Good but...,The application works for me.  I like that it is easier to use than other applications of its type but the page to sign in is frustrating.  If I've not logged out why do I have click in to log in and then get re-directed to Facebook?  Eliminate a step or two.,

4592,4,2013-03-07T08:08:27.000Z,Fitnesshighashley,User friendly,"It's easy to use, I like the graphs and ways you can track. I wish there was a bigger index of food to pick from so I could use less manual food plug ins. Also wish I could view graphs for more than just the day like the one explaining how much protein, carbs, etc you consumed. Overall great app",

4804,3,2015-07-17T18:07:21.000Z,üë∏üèªüëë,Calories vs. Exercise,"I get to track food easily and adding your own food is easy, but there is very limited choices of exercise. Sit ups for example is ONLY sit ups, there's no variation you can put in like oblique crunch, plank, leg lifts none of those are options. Also you can only put in the amount of time you workout, not reps or sets.",
4805,5,2015-07-24T18:37:17.000Z,sl399,Great database,Makes food and water tracking easy because I can open up the app and record something with a few taps. Huge food database to help me get an idea of what I'm really eating every day. Other good features too.,
4806,5,2015-08-19T18:25:35.000Z,Wysoccer,Excellent,I use this every single day. Great way to keep track of your eating and workout lifestyle. It includes a lot of foods already out there. The scanning feature works really well. Definitely recommend this app.,
4807,5,2015-08-23T14:06:08.000Z,Milazen,Love,Clean simple design. Easy to use. You can chose to have it send you alerts when it's time to log your calories. Huge food database. Makes calorie counting quick and easy. I prefer over my fitness pal and calorie king.,

4809,5,2015-09-22T21:15:26.000Z,Meika'sMom,Most Reliable App,This app is very reliable. I have it synced with Health App for iPhone and this automatically calculates my daily steps and exercises into the app. All of the verified calculations are accurate to my knowledge. This is the best calorie counting app I've used- and the best health app in general!,
4810,5,2013-08-01T21:31:06.000Z,Clementhyme,So helpful!,I've been using this app for almost 2 weeks and it is great! I'm using it to lose a few pounds since exercising alone wasn't quite doing it. I needed to become more aware of how much I was eating and this is a great solution for me.,
4811,4,2013-08-25T19:59:38.000Z,Ladydidi1,I really like it,"It allows to search most foods and even  shows the distribution of macronutrients ( proteins, fats & carbs ) which is helpful when trying to aim for a particular ratio I just wish they had a section that added up your total macronutrients for you for example total proteins, fats & carbs",

This app will help you track how many calories you intake but it's up to you to burn those calories and eat right! It's simple as A B C. Always Burn Calories! Good luck!,
4813,5,2014-02-12T12:18:31.000Z,Tedunn1090,Great help!,I realy like how the app is easy to miniver through. But let's you use all the info that you need to enter to track the calories you had. I really recumbent this app to any one who needs to take more control in what they eat.,
4814,5,2014-05-02T21:53:19.000Z,Mysterrid,Live strong,Really a nice app to help keep myself motivated. Love seeing my progress! No technical issues that I have found. Would be nice if we knew the odds of possibly winning one of the sweepstakes. If it's one in a gazillion I don't want to waste my time with it.,
4815,5,2014-05-19T16:56:03.000Z,sashley35,Better than FitnessPal,I love this app! Beautiful layout and simple to use. I've used several calorie/weight loss apps and this one takes the cake. I love the water app! I drink so much more water when I have a visual to keep track of my water intake.,
4816,4,2014-06-21T17:59:09.000Z,Kattygirl18,Great little app,Love this app. I have tried others and always come back to this one. Very user friendly. If food isn't in data bank it's very easy to add. Love it. Have loss 20 lbs using this handy little app. Helps you realize just how many extra calories you are eating a day!,
4817,4,2014-06-23T14:47:20.000Z,Cezarav,Great app for keeping track!,Really easy to use. The barcode database is not as extensive as other apps I've used in the past but it is so easy to manually enter the data I don't mind. Helps me to stay mindful of the foods I eat and my exercise. And that is the whole point. Recommend!!!,
4818,4,2014-12-24T17:53:00.000Z,Johnycque,Helps you eat better,Outstanding. Helps you eat better even if you don't need to lose weight. Has a few minor flaws that don't detract from what it does. Hope they continue to improve without making it complicated. Well done.,
4819,3,2014-12-26T03:10:18.000Z,Sucker 1min old,Should be better,"Data entry is very easy. However goal setting is not up to speed.  Can't set personal goals for carb/protein/and fat.  That really hurts the usefulness of an otherwise excellent app.  Also would be nice to be able to set a weight goal of an amount and a date, and then track if on goal or behind goal.",
4820,4,2013-01-31T06:20:52.000Z,Peckernose,Review,Good program but could be made easier to work with. Such as having the apps we choose to use in conjunction with the parent app fill in automatically when the like info is added to the p/a. Why is it necessary to log exercise into 2 separate places?,
4821,5,2013-02-23T14:24:12.000Z,ÓàÅWhite n' NerdyÓàÅ,Gives motivation,The best thing about this app is that it gives you points towards gift cards for tracking calories. It's extra motivation to keep track of your food intake and weight.,
4822,5,2013-02-26T04:13:39.000Z,Joyouz,Love this app,"Absolutely love this app.  The goals are very realistic compare to other apps that I've used before.  I'm able to watch what I eat and see the effects.  I love that it breaks down what I've eaten for the day, so I know what to eat and avoid next time.",
4823,5,2013-02-26T15:26:00.000Z,176washington,Very nice app,"Just started using this app to track my calorie intake. I like it very much. It has access to a large database of food items with calorie counts at your fingertips. A real timesaver, easy to use, will elp me stay on track with my weight loss.",
4824,4,2013-03-08T02:16:04.000Z,Amadoto1,Rate this app,I really appreciate this app. I had created a tracking doc in Excel . It was working for me. I had to look up foods i eat on the internet to get values so i can track them. This Aap is so convenient. I do better at tracking consistently because the information needed is at my finger tips.,
4825,5,2013-03-19T06:35:37.000Z,Lovingeden,Love it,Super easy to use and it's very cool the way that they track everything...great because I use a combination of apps to track my food and excercise and this adds another dimension with neat information about my health that I wasn't aware of.,
4826,5,2013-06-08T16:07:13.000Z,Msgreatplate,Eater of food,"Easy to use with not a lot of clutter or information you don't need. Also, I have been able to locate all my food choices on the calorie search, which is great since I eat a variety of ethnic food.",

It counts fats and carbs too. It also takes into account exercise. Overall a great little app.",
4828,5,2013-07-02T18:10:19.000Z,Stanflakes,Great App,I've only been using it for 2 weeks and I see the difference already...there's something about seeing how many calories you're taking in that makes you want to eat right.,
4829,5,2013-07-30T01:33:36.000Z,Safety-3rd,It works!,I highly recommend this app...it works flawlessly and is easy to use. Also; it keeps you thinking about what you eat and what you will have to add later to the tracker (accountability in a way).,
4830,5,2012-05-10T00:02:14.000Z,Royz81,Love it,Started using this two weeks ago...really great idea to track what you eating. Thru keeping my cals under recommended levels and exercising I've dropped 9 pounds already. Very easy to use and most things u eat are already Loaded.,
4831,4,2012-07-21T17:06:25.000Z,Overweight Pleasure,My LIVESTRONG,Great App. It work well to track your daily intake of the meals you ate. And it track the amount of water you drank. The only down fall to it is that it doesn't allow you to go back to the previous day to record your intake for that day .just in case you were to busy that day to do so,
4832,5,2012-08-10T03:38:52.000Z,hitachiinlover,Love it!,"To be completely honest, I was a little skeptical to purchase the app. I didn't know if it would actually work, but once I started tracking, a whole world of possibilities opened up! This app DOES work, I've lost about 3 pounds in 3 weeks! Amazing!",
4833,5,2012-08-18T04:43:40.000Z,RachAGoGo,Helpful App,"I've been using this app for about a month now, and have lost 8 pounds. I find tracking food and exercise helpful in keeping me on track, and this is really user-friendly. No problems so far.",
4834,5,2012-09-23T13:14:05.000Z,iGinny,Barcode Scanner,"Love this App. I feel good knowing everything is accurate.  But please add a Barcode Scanner, it would be much easier and quicker if I could just bleep and scan my product instead if searching for it.",
4835,4,2012-11-02T17:26:09.000Z,Tinkdd03,Work at UPS,Love the app so far. The only thing I don't like is that I can't sign into my actual account with the lite version.  I also had to go to another app to track,
4836,4,2013-01-14T22:58:37.000Z,Laceofages,Pretty good,It's very easy to use and convenient. The only downside is that you can't link it to the website. I have an account and love to be able to sync them but you can't (that I know of). It seems like it would be very simple for them to do this. Otherwise I like it.,
4837,4,2017-07-18T06:15:47.000Z,changingtobefit,Great app..just don't know how to log out,I like this app. I've used livestrong in the past and lost weight. Looking forward to using this app everyday. Would like to log out but app says will delete local data and reset application settings to default settings.,"Hi! Before logging out, just make sure to perform a Force Sync with our servers. That will save your data and prevent it from being lost when you log out!

I just want to count calories, not become a 'member' of yet another group. I'd probably pay a few bucks to use without registering or signing in. I have been told by the developer that registering is so I 'can accurately track and save [my] progress!' to which I call BS; plenty of apps store data locally without my registering. Registering is so THEY can track ME!",Hello! We require you to register so that you can accurately track and save your progress!

4841,4,2017-01-01T13:58:10.000Z,BFBike,My Plate - Knowledge is power,Knowledge is power and this app gives all that knowledge you need. Losing weight is all about being honest with yourself about how much you eat and how much you burn and this allows you to track that information so you can be  just that.,
4842,4,2017-02-12T22:30:39.000Z,Panda dog lover 152,Very Good,The app is easy to work and can be very helpful. However I wish it could connect with my workout tracker because I do not always have my phone on me when working out. This is only a matter of getting more accurate results.,
4843,5,2017-03-04T13:30:06.000Z,Fps Russ,Awesome app,The reason I think this app is so great is the fact that it has workouts for you that shows how many calories you burned. Its an easy way to know where you are sitting in terms of calories for the day.,
4844,5,2017-03-09T15:50:24.000Z,Hex_love,This is wonderful!,"I have never been more aware with what I'm putting in my mouth! I weight lift, and getting enough protein is a little hard for me if I want to gain muscle, (I'm a vegetarian) but this app really helps me pay attention to protein especially!",
4845,5,2017-03-12T12:35:50.000Z,ThilmCo,Love this app,Cannot say much more. I like how it is integrated with Apple health. Keeps track of all my steps and cross integrates with other health apps as well. The food tracker works really well. I have the upgraded version and am really happy with it.,
4846,2,2017-03-13T01:27:31.000Z,girlfromky,This latest update is AWFUL,It is ugly but more important it makes it very hard to see or edit what you have eaten - or plan to eat. I generally enter all my daily planned foods in the morning but sometimes plans change - this makes it impossible. Please bring back the interface that you actually show on the app webpage. The new one is ugly and not user friendly at all!,

Helps give perspective and true nutritional amounts. In the medical Community people use it for weight gain and maintenance too. Super easy to use",
4848,2,2017-06-16T16:10:12.000Z,Rika5209,Not good for meals made from scratch,"I like how this app tracks your fats, proteins, and carbs along with calories. However I made spaghetti from scratch and tried to enter into the app. To enter it you need to know the calories, protein, sugar, fats, carbs... Most of that I don't know. So I searched for what others have used for spaghetti and there was a hundred different options. Where I cook most meals from scratch this app doesn't work for me.",
4849,5,2017-07-03T17:57:34.000Z,Mwatersva,Easy to use!,"Very natural usage, excellent to track calories and quick to use. Had some trouble at first  with iPhone and Apple Watch both recording the same exercises, but disconnected watch and all good.",

I have lost 25 pounds just through being more aware of what I am eating. This app and its gentle reminders have helped me form better habits for me and my family.,
4857,2,2016-07-09T17:15:14.000Z,Winks2012,Just OK,Just started using the app but right away the barcode scanner feature is terrible. It takes 5 minutes of holding the phone over a barcode before it is recognized and a search begins. When it finally searches half the time I'm told it's not in the database. I have other scanner apps that work instantly so something is wrong with the programming of this app.,
4858,4,2016-08-03T02:03:20.000Z,Tetley Teddy,"Good app, could be better","It's not a bad app.  Where it is weak is in the nutrition breakdown of foods.  So if you are trying to carefully track you macro diet be prepared that not all foods have all the information.  Same issue when you create a food or meal, can't add all of the macro detail of nutrition information.",

The text entering is also a little bit odd, and you can't include decimals when entering macro values. Unfortunately these things all make the app somewhat unusable for myself.",

4965,4,2012-06-07T17:45:50.000Z,Sudah K,Great app.  Could do more,"This is a great app with a great data base of food.  I wish it also provided fiber and sodium content in foods and permitted the user to specify when a new day begins, rather than at midnight. When I eat after midnight, the food is included in the next days food rather than the day I'm eating it.",

Some large chains aren't represented like Chik-fil-a and when you do a search it's pretty cluttered with user submissions rather than verified calorie counts. Same with exercise.",

5050,1,2012-10-06T15:24:59.000Z,VMF426,Very disappointing,"I expect more from Livestrong brand. This app is glitchy! I couldn't change my weight in settings. It was stuck at the default 145, even after closing and opening/retrying several times. Couldn't find Step Aerobics to track my morning gym class no matter what key words I used. I deleted this app 5 minutes after downloading it and I'm not usually one to be extremely strict on apps. Big disappointment!!!",
5051,5,2012-12-28T02:35:23.000Z,Takes a lot of pix,Great way to help control your eating,This app is a great way to start gaining control of your eating. Not only are their meals that you can search for like restaurant food but you can also manually import caloric information,

Logging keeps you honest. The reward points are a good incentive. It feels good to donate them to charity. I do wish the program could tell me how to tweak my diet for optimal performance though.,
5056,3,2013-02-11T19:00:15.000Z,Bltn1234,Kind of a let down,When I saw the easy interface and the overall very positive reviews I thought this app would be better. The calorie estimates for the foods were pretty good and there was a good amount of variety but the calorie estimates for the exercises had no variety...95% of the types of exercise I do were not listed,

5077,1,2017-03-10T03:32:58.000Z,Florida App purchaser,Bad Update,I have been using this App everyday for 18 months. This update is not good.  You cannot see your macros. All it tells you is that you have 0 left.  Ok - how much did I go over?  No idea.  If this feature is not fixed ASAP I will switch apps.,
5078,1,2017-03-10T16:27:50.000Z,Justuskurtz,Hate the update,"I used to love this ap for the main purpose of tracking how many grams of protein, fat and carbs I've eaten for the day. The new version only tells you how many you have left to eat for the day based on a percentage that relates to your goal calorie intake. So I'll be looking for a new macro tracker that allows me to track it, the original way. I'm a trainer and used to recommend this ap to every client on their very first day. Not anymore.",

I switched from other food- and fitness-tracking apps to My Plate mostly for its user interface and its more extensive food catalog (a greater variety of recognized foods, including restaurant dishes and a variety of cuisines). This latest version of the app is not counterintuitive for users and is mostly frustrating. Please change back. (If not, I'll find a new app!)",Hi- thank you for your review! Our team is testing a few variations of this update and is working on making changes based on user feedback. Please feel free to email us support@livestrong.com with any specific comments!

5086,4,2015-05-16T02:32:24.000Z,Imbad3423,Lots of positives,This is a better app than my fitness pal with only one thing that it's missing and that is that it doesn't allow you to input your homemade recipes to add to your log..... Unless there is something that I'm missing here. Overall a good app.,

5095,3,2014-01-04T01:16:39.000Z,S0541,Livestrong,Average program. It has some great highlights like the scan feature however it doesn't have enough products loaded to make useful. It also needs preloaded food items instead of making you load all the information yourself.,

5100,3,2012-12-14T14:32:38.000Z,Touch Winslow,Crashes alot,For a free App it's very functional and easy to use. However the ads and the more wards are very irritating. They show up every time you enter something. Also the recently and frequently eaten lists are inaccurate and seemed to be arranged in alphabetic order and once on the list don't change,
5101,4,2013-01-04T05:14:40.000Z,Runamateur,Great app that crashes a little too frequently,Though this app is prone to closing for no reason it has one of the best tracking systems I have seen.

I think it would be helpful if the App identified wheat in the food you eat. Also it could add a field to record any extra vitamins and supplements you take.,

That or people will talk down to you and team up to bully you. It's quite sad actually. These people have been there so long that if you don't praise what they say, your wrong and will be humiliated. It's not worth it community wise. Also, the app itself recommends too low of a calorie count, it made me physically sick.",
5150,5,2013-02-02T14:24:21.000Z,Glueckert,Great app,So easy to use. Sometimes finding exercises in the tracker can be tricky unless you word it just the right way. Example spin class or biking can only be found if you type in indoor cycling,

This is commonly considered the lowest a number of calories a person can eat in a day without doctor supervision. Since most of our users do not check with a doctor before taking on such a goal, or are unable to do, we implemented this as a safety feature."

6061,1,2014-11-07T18:49:09.000Z,Vikslav,Macros not updating correctly.,Macros don't update when you enter multiple servings. The calorie count updates correctly but the macros won't increase with multiple servings. This causes confusion when you reach your caloric intake for the day but the macros are low according to the nutrition section. The only work around is to add multiple servings individually. You really need to fix your app.,

6410,5,2012-04-17T10:32:20.000Z,Difrint,Sweet!,This app is informative and easy to use... Great for getting a realistic perspective on how many calories you actually consume...as long as you're honest with yourself of course :),

6412,5,2012-06-30T22:47:18.000Z,Valcour'Mom,Review,Love this app!  It is the easiest way I have ever used to keep track of what I eat .  You can even get calories for  many brand name foods leaving the guesswork out.,

6414,4,2012-09-24T15:02:50.000Z,ccedwards88,Helpful,This app reminds me a lot of weight watchers but instead of keeping up with points you keep up with calorie intake. I find it helpful in keeping track of not just how much I eat but what I eat.,

6417,1,2013-01-09T07:08:23.000Z,Brrrrrrrrds,No thanks,The free version of this app is no good (either that or I just don't know how to use it). I'll stick to Spark People. It's free and has food to choose from (like a medium sized egg for example) without having to either manually enter ALL of your food/calories or pay for the luxury of not having to do so.  Sorry I don't share the enthusiasm of the rest of the app raters.,

6637,1,2014-01-07T19:05:09.000Z,Greyskiesla,Ridiculous.,"Garbage app. How does a 330 cal meal entered on the web version equate to 20,000 cal on the app?  Because the app is unable to distinguish between 100g and 100 servings, that's why.   Oh, and you can't enter recipes on the app, nor does it sync meals that are deleted on the web version. Absolutely bloody useless, one of the most limiting and disappointing apps I've ever used.  Deleting immediately.",

6643,2,2013-07-13T12:05:07.000Z,Disappointed96,Calorie Counter is better,I didn't really like this app. Maybe it's because I've used calorie counter before because I found that this app doesn't have as many foods and their nutritional info stored as calorie counter which has just about every food and beverage.

When i enter something under any section of meals it puts it down & it goes either my foods or my meals, wherever I put it. But if notice a mistake there's only 1 way to fix it. & that's edit it. There's no way to completely delete it & start over. I noticed that several things are listed exactly the same like 50 x's under my foods as well & there is no way to delete all but 1 of the entries. Under my meals are a few entries that were done when I was 1st learning & I would really like to delete them. But like I said, there's no way, at least not that I know of . The only thing I've been able 2 delete are entries under that day 4 each meal or snack , exercise, etc... Would looovvveeee it if u could make deleting items possible from my foods or my meals.

10191,4,2016-02-11T14:09:15.000Z,Aprileny,Just a few suggestions,"Today is day 2 of not smoking and this app with the community support helped dramatically. A couple suggestions that would make a world of difference. 1. I was trying reach out for support(trying to get through a rough moment) and apply a personal message, it didn't allow me too, because the keyboard hides the send button and there's no way to scroll it down(to get it out of the way) so it refers to the pre-provided mess. 2. I reached out to support team because the app nor the website(Livestrong) would allow you to add a profile pic, after asking the community, I realized I was able to do so from the Myplate app, would have been less frustrating had I known this. 3. It would be amazing if we could apply emojisüòçüëäüèº‚úäüèº to our post or comments, as this is a smartphoneüì≤ app, most of the worldüåé uses emojis nowadaysüòä, also it would be nice if we could have a like button üëçüèº (Like on Facebook) to allow others to know we enjoyed their comment/comments without having to reply to every person who's commenting some encouragement. 4. It would be nice if we had a tracker to give us the info of how our life/health is improving hour by hour or day by day from not smoking. Other apps supply this info but not this one. But I like this one much better because of the community support. So overall  you guys have invented a great app and if you tweaked it a little, I would definitely consider buying the premium version!!! I hope you guys read these reviews and take into consideration our tips or issues on how to improve the app/apps. Again thank you for making this app, I literally searched and searched trying to figure out which app was best suited for my needs in quitting smoking, I finally decided on this one.",

The reason I gave it 3 stars is because you cannot enter the food weight in grams for most of the foods and even for the ones you have the option, this app will only give you single digit entry so you would only be able to enter up to 9 grams so I take this to be a bug in the app and it bugs me a lot. Another problem with it is that it does not seem to show much of the nutritional value of what you ate during the day as a summary. It only shows Carbs Fats and Protein. I am contemplating if I should go back to the CalorieCount app that has a very useful nutritional value break down and gives you grades according to how healthy were the foods you ate. While that app does not exchange info with Apple Health, it allows to enter the foods in grams and that is very important when you are using a scale.",Hello!

13955,5,2021-05-05T01:07:40.000Z,rfalco1121,Absolutely The Best Food Tracking App,"I have tried every food tracking app out there and MyPlate is hands down the best. Similar to other apps you can search your food or scan a barcode and have the nutrition information auto fill in. If it isn‚Äôt there, you can always manually add it in too. To be honest though, there are some things that the app won‚Äôt recognize by bar code but almost 90% of those things are your local grocery store self made products and not big name brand products they stock on shelves. The app also has a macronutrient tracker which absolutely imperative when you are trying to lose weight. Other apps make you pay for that feature but MyPlate offers it for free!! The app also offers some healthy food recipes that correlate to how many calories you have left in any particular day should you choose to use them. I have not tried the meal plan so I cannot comment on that. MyPlate also lets you set your goal weight and how many pounds you want to lose per week, which is something other apps allow too but just so you know that feature is also here. Like I outlined above, the app though is absolutely perfect and worth more than 5 stars for being free. I‚Äôve lost 45 pounds so far and have another 30 to go and couldn‚Äôt have done it without this app.",Hi there! Thank you for your thorough review.

Not only does it allow one to look up items easily by typing their names, but it has a fantastic barcode scanner that will automatically enter the calorie and nutrient. data from the barcode after scanning the code. This allows one quickly to adjust only the portion/servings eaten and be finished. It works extremely well even though not every brand is in its database. Never fear, however, one may add the food to the one‚Äôs own food database, and then it will be available for the next time it is eaten. One may also create special recipes or meal items and add those to one‚Äôs own food database such that all the facts are there for easy entry for on a subsequent use. Moreover, when eating out, one can look up foods in chain restaurants, and they will often already be a part of the food database contained in the app‚Äîan added bonus that makes the app even easier to use.",

And if you are simply choosing a food such as ‚Äúcooked rice‚Äù you cannot change the amount consumed. It‚Äôs just a full cup or whatever quantity you clicked on in your search.

MD wanted to start insulin but hubby is one of the people who refuse ‚Äúto live on a needle‚Äù.  I gave him a choice either do a diet with my help or the shot plus a few choice words. I am a retired RN and I‚Äôve been giving him advice to help but he was even refusing my help. I downloaded this app and I had used another app a few years ago that was still on my phone. I tracked his diet for 2 days and showed him how much he was eating. 3-4,000 was his normal day. After my ultimatum he agreed to follow a 2000 calorie diet. When I plugged age 60, ht. 5‚Äô10‚Äù, wt. 198 in with his work activity of moderate it showed him needing 2100 +. We went to store together and I made him help pick out stuff instead of me doing it all. Once home I spent afternoon cutting, chopping, and prefixing salads and diving meat into individual freezer bowls. He is even helping to pack his breakfast and snacks to take to work with him. This past week he has done really well and has not strayed. He is down to 193 and staying at 2,000-2,100 calories. He likes seeing the graph that he is in our goal range. His fasting finger stick was 317 the first time he rechecked and this am it was down to 246. He is tickled and I am thrilled. I got a couple of books in DM foods and he actually looked at one and was making comments and suggestions so we are in the right track for first time in year and a half.

Enter the specifics of the food, and tap ""Done"" in the upper right corner. To group custom (or any) foods together, select Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, or Snack, and then tap ""My Meals"".

I removed & then downloaded this app again. I figured entering my calories burnt manually would be a simple fix.","Hi Jnajam1975! Thank you for your review and feedback. At this time, the MyPlate app syncs directly with the Apple Health app and will read step activity tracked from devices you've synced to that app already. It is not meant to sync directly with the Stepz app."

Most items are in the system already and if not the bar code works great and the ease of entering and adjusting is perfect. I might even upgrade I‚Äôm so satisfied with it!,
14056,3,2018-04-13T06:43:59.000Z,Sari Friedman,Nice But Some Problems,"Doesn‚Äôt track sodium or cholesterol in practice because many ‚Äúverified‚Äù food listings do not include that info. The current ‚Äúverified‚Äù listing for chicken thighs, for example, says they have zero cholesterol - this is not accurate. Also I have had repeated issues with connectivity to iPhone motion and activity data. I have to reset this again and again. Further the program doesn‚Äôt follow progress longer than a year. Good points are that the interface is very friendly, fast, easy and fun. It‚Äôs workable if you don‚Äôt mind paying $44.99 to get basic info like calories.",

Got a pop-up that told me I had won a $1,000 Amazon Gift Card. It would only give me the option of hitting OK to get it off my screen. I called BS and forced the app to close. Was planning on going gold but if you guys are taking money from scammers and giving them access to me...why would I pay you a dime? REALLY loved this app...so REALLY disappointed being targeted by scammers through it. Guess I‚Äôll have to look for something else.",

I don't need your help to tell me what to eat. Especially since you're taking money from food companies--I'm sure that doesn't factor into anything. I was perfectly happy with this app until I had to go thru and create an account and profile just to use an app I was happily using for the last 3 years. The only reason I went through the process was to leave this review. I'll be finding something else.,Hi Mcnulty! We are so sorry for this inconvenience. We completely understand your frustration.

I started my workout routine along with a new diet, with the help of this app, I'm able to keep track of my progress successfully. However, there are some cons, hence why I gave it a 4 stars.",
14186,3,2017-07-20T20:20:10.000Z,Minjesu,I want to love this app...,"However, 90% of the time when I try to add a new food I get an error code - but only after I have taken the time to enter ALL the data. This is maddening. I have used this app on and off over the course of several years now and this problem never gets fixed. I am looking for a better app right now for this very reason. Almost everything else about the app is terrific. I like the scanning feature, I like the number of verified foods (though I do often notice they are slightly inaccurate), I like the charts/tracking feature, the appearance, and the reminders. Not being able to enter new foods though makes me crazy and completely destroys my ability to track accurately what I am eating. Another minor complaint is that the user submitted foods that are shared are often WAY off.  A user submitted baked potato is listed as having 30 grams of protein. Ha! Probably a mistype, but still, if you do not pay close attention to the nutrition content, you could be tracking some very inaccurate protein, fat, sugar, and carb levels.","Hi Minjesu, thank you so much for your feedback! We are aware of the issue with decimal points and we're working on a fix! We apologize for this inconvenience and hope to have a resolution soon."

14188,4,2017-08-04T20:08:12.000Z,Nelson Ned,Nice visuals and works good with watch,I have used this app since the App Store came out on iOS (yes from 2008). It has served me well and the updates have made it even better. The only issue I have is with the scanner. It's almost not worth the time using it since the success rate of reading barcodes is very low. Most barcodes on food packaging are not on an exactly flush or perfectly flat surface which makes for difficulty reading with an iPhone 7 Plus camera. This could definitely be improved with better app code as the camera optics are more than up to the task of reading barcodes in varied conditions. Also a few of the barcodes are bringing up incorrect nutritional information and there's no obvious method to correct or submit a correction.,
14189,3,2017-08-15T12:27:12.000Z,Smt_92,Can't really log exercises...,This would be my go-to health app if it was easier to add custom workouts. For example to add that I did 100 squats in a day would be a pain in the butt. Change this and the app would be perfect! I appreciate the workout programs that come with the app and love everything else though. Please make an update!,

This works very well as it scans almost any bar code and you can custom create your own foods and meals. I upgraded to the premium version and it is worth every cent to me.

I am on a keto diet and need to see the percentage of calories coming from fat, protein, and carbs. This feature is gone! It looks like you have to pay for this now, but the android app has not changed and it's still available on the free version. The overall look of the app is horrible now too! Please bring back the old version! Until then it's useless to me and I will not be using it.",
14206,1,2017-03-11T22:57:53.000Z,Pumkin53,Please bring back the old UI,"I hope the product team reads these reviews.  Why would you remove existing functionality in an update?  Many of your users are bariatric and keto dieters, who closely monitor their protein, carb and fat intake on a daily basis.  Not only did you remove this functionality, you also changed the interface to require MORE taps before logging meals and water.  WTH?  I've happily used this app for 18 months, but now I had to download MFP so I can track my macros.  I'm sad, hope you bring back the previous functionality.",

I even tried doing it again as 22.0g and still, it was logged as some ridiculously small amount.

Quick entry and create new food) from create a new food option it won't put in the correct number formatting.  For instance I put in 22gm of carbs and it displays as 0.0022gms of carbs... And it did this to all the nutrional data which makes EVERYTHING INCORRECT.  I saw another reviewer had this same issue so I tried their trick of adding a decimal point... 22.0gm. And it still didn't work.  PLUS.... there's  no way to delete that food entry if you select that option of adding it. You can tell because there are now TWO ENTRIES for caramel cobwebs from universal studios lol.  No way to edit or delete a food... This is TERRIBLE!,
14214,4,2016-10-31T11:44:09.000Z,jefferydfw,Pretty Darn Good,"I downloaded this app about a week ago to track my caloric, protein and fat intake.  Im only utilizing the free part of the app currently.  Its pretty darn good.  It meets my basic needs.  Id like to see a time stamp (that can be over-ridden) so I can know exactly when im consuming what...plus a comment/note input for each entry so that I can keep track about why I chose that particular food item.  Note entries like pre-workout, post-workout, unable to access something more nutritious, traveling, etc...  The food item list also needs some type of common sense order to it.  Just for example, type in Egg McMuffin, and you will have a very difficult time finding the regular McDonalds Egg McMuffin.  It should be listed first. Its the same with most items.  Kudos though to the scanning feature.  That really is a great ability.  Anyways, I highly recommend this app.  Great job LiveStrong.org.",
14215,3,2016-11-19T16:08:16.000Z,Mrjlaforge,Use it lots but I'm not sure about the accuracy,"The layout of this app is great, and I like using it but it really falls short of Fat Secret's tracker in two major ways. One, most of the food is user submitted and clearly wrong. For example, you can find the same food listed as 200 - 600 calories for the same serving size. Two, the serving selections are really limited. Fat secret let's you measure in many different units but this only gives you one and you have to do a lot of conversions. Finally the paid service gives some useful data but I don't like the way it is calculated (though I haven't found a better option for this so I DO pay for the service and use the app despite that).",
14216,5,2016-12-20T13:30:24.000Z,Long Beach Smitty,Great Calorie Tracker,"I've been using the free version. I've learned over the years that the best way for me to lose weight is to track my caloric intake. This app is fantastic at doing just that. Once you start with the settings and the amount of weight you'd like to lose each week tracking what you eat is simple. There's a vast database of nutritional info and if you can't find it on their database you can enter it manually or scan the UPC code. It sure beats writing stuff down on pieces of paper and looking up the nutritional data in a book or online. It also enables you to account for you fitness regimen as it automatically subtracts calories according to the type of exercise you do. This is a great, easy to use app! You're also not constantly bombarded with requests to upgrade to the premium version.",

14222,2,2016-08-16T13:03:16.000Z,kidsshouldnthavedonethat,Too many errors,"This app has too many bugs and errors, especially with the bar code scanner, that I will no longer be using this app. Almost every bar code I scan results in inaccurate calorie and fat counts. The box will say 270 calories, and My Plate will say 290 calories for example. This happens almost every time. The app also does not allow you to delete foods from your list that you have eaten in the past. It was a pretty good app until the fiasco of March 2016 when an update caused me to have other users' food and exercise in my app. I still have foods I have never eaten in my life that I can't delete. Although it has improved, the synchronization with the iPhone health app step counter is often skewed and My Plate will show a ridiculous amount of calories burned such as 700 calories by 9 a.m. It also does not sync with the My Plate web site. I am still resentful that my iPhone health app contains other people's weights from the March update. Maybe it will go away since I am about the delete this app. I will use the iPhone health app to track my steps, weight and water intake from here forward. I had used My Plate on PC long before it was taken over by Livestrong and long before it was an app. Say goodbye to a user of 7 years My Plate.",

I can not use this app anymore because every interaction with the interface is prevented by this stupid ad. It won't stop. Make it stop. I just want to count calories and cut weight.

I've used plenty of scanners before and this one is a pain to use. It's not intuitive where you hold it over the bar code and it scans like other scanners.

Yesterday it recorded i burned 28000 calories and had data from devices belonging to other people on it. I honestly have to question now if any of my information is accurate and if I have wasted my time.  I have been busting my but eating a low calorie diet and exercising and now i have to wonder how long this thing has been corrupting my data i use to keep myself on track.   There has to be a better solution",

After contacting them about it, they responded very quickly and resolved the problem. THANK YOU AND GOOD JOB!   I'll stick with the 5 star rating.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: After discovering that I had Type 2 diabetes, I downloaded this app to track consumed sugar and calories.  I'm now hook on this app.  I use it whenever I eat anything and love the ability to scan food labels.  Although it seems to have a huge database of food items, I sometimes have trouble deciding which of the identically named items I'm eating, e.g., ""Medium Apple"" at 80 calories or ""Medium Apple"" at 90 calories (this is a minor complaint).  The other issue is whether the proper adjustment is made to accumulated sugar for eating partial portions - I read someplace that this wasn't handled correctly, but I haven't checked this myself.  I also like the integration with the HEART app.  Allowing a daily entry for measured blood sugar would be interesting.",

I also like how it helps you and reminds you to track your food intake . The food options are unlimited and it has found almost all of the foods I have eaten .This app is great but there are a few things that may make it better .I think it should tell you lists of certain diets that have worked for other people because it may help others .It should also give you workouts that a specifically for certain body parts .That way then the app may work better and people would start seeing results fastest.

You will change your routine for the better. They have such a large library of foods you just have to type in if you don't have a bar code (which works ever time in seconds) or you can manually put it in. It's nice knowing what your putting in your body and seeing how your routine affects your health. Again You will change your routine for the better. Only reason I hold one star is bc I see a bright future for this app and I hope the creators will push the limits with its future. But bc I don't want them to have 4 stars I'll post 5.

14314,3,2013-12-14T17:15:23.000Z,DefiantNature,App is good! But crashes TOO much. FIX IT QUCKLY!,"This app is an awesome app but i noticed it does crash a couple of times. It would hav been 5 if it doesnt... Needs more improvement in food searches.  And i hope they could add the feature in custom foods that we could put the saturated fats and other stuff not just the protein,carbs and fat.mthat would really bring this app to 5 star! So work it out app creator! Ty",
14315,5,2013-12-26T17:46:28.000Z,alexmaxis18,No complaints,"I have absolutely no complaints about this app. I've been using it to track my calories and macronutrients (protein, fats, and carbs). It's been 2 weeks now and I've lost 4 pounds of fat while maintaining muscle. This is a straight forward no B.S app that WILL yield results if you track everything and don't go over the calorie intake limit.",
14316,5,2014-01-03T21:47:09.000Z,Todd Blackfox,Super app,"Great app for tracking weight. Helps keep you honest and really shows what you are eating. Only downside is the exercise section, there aren't any tools to help calculate how many calories you burn say at work, or cleaning the house, everything is preset. However, the bat code scanner really helps match your foods!",
14317,5,2014-02-18T13:55:03.000Z,Chr1stymaerend0n,I love it!,"As a person who is barely really learning to count calories to lose weight, this is a great app! It's really easy to use and understand.. Only downside is that the bar code scanner doesn't read everything.. But overall I think it's great!",
14318,4,2014-02-19T14:51:04.000Z,Simbalicious01,Love it!!!,Especially love the sensor. Now I don't need to wear a pedometer to track my activity. Motivates me to get off my butt,
14319,4,2014-02-20T18:06:01.000Z,Yrallthegoodnamestakn?,Great app!,Absolutely love this app! Makes tracking calories and exercise. The only thing that could use done improvement is the bar code scanner. I have found very few items that actually come up.,
14320,2,2013-09-25T23:36:16.000Z,KevinGuzman,iOS 7 update needs fixing,Results don't show up anymore when searching.. loved the app before the update messed this up.,
14321,1,2013-09-26T16:49:05.000Z,Don't fix it,If its not broken,I loved this app that is until  the last update. It crashes all the time no matter what you try to do with it. Why they changed to color from the live strong yellow and blue to orange and blue is beyond me. Basically they killed a great app and added a stupid bar code scanner that doesn't work hardly at all its a waste of time . The app is now crap . When it WAS working it was awesome! My advise is - Don't fix it if its not broken !  You better fix it now because you really broke it this time.,
14322,1,2013-09-27T14:59:59.000Z,"Pullman, WA",Issues,"Used to be really good.  Had to reload for iOS 7. Currently, cannot track weight as the AARP add banner runs right across the track weight button. Too bad, use to be great.  What use is it if you can't track your weight?  Also, graph was better before.",
14323,4,2013-10-01T15:29:29.000Z,Yidra,Needs Repair,"I have been using this app for over a month, and was due to rate it about now. I love the app, and after updating my iOS to 7, I got excited when I saw the bar code reader feature. When it decides to connect to any data base, I am sure it will be awesome. There are too many bugs currently to properly rate it at this time.",
14324,1,2013-10-04T00:07:08.000Z,Kerwinace:),What the heck!!!,"Since updating to iOS7, it says all exercise burns zero calories. Not cool.",

14326,3,2013-10-11T12:45:25.000Z,Jessbnpb,"Great app, but update needed","I have been using the app for the better part of a year to manage my weight. I had no complaints until I updated to iOS 7. I do love the scan option, but the search (scanned/typed) only accesses my recent foods. If I want to add a new food, it simply doesn't show up. The point tracker is really annoying where they moved it. I do like the new color block scheme.",
14327,5,2013-10-23T21:06:48.000Z,hanroy5,Loyal user! :),Have been using for the last two years! Very happy with the selection of foods! I'm so glad they included the bar code scanner! Can't wait to start trying it out!,
14328,3,2013-10-24T02:00:01.000Z,Likingthisgame,Nice but don't like the ads,"Very nice app, like the design but it can get confusing and can look cluttered. I  really like how you can interact with others by asking and answering fitness/health related questions",
14329,2,2013-11-04T17:21:37.000Z,Kym14,Food Search??,"I don't like the app too much. It's hard because I've only been able to keep track of scanned items, as in only items that have a bar code. Maybe I don't know how to work it but it doesn't really allow me to search for my food. Every time I search it gives me nothing. It would be a better app if I could also search for food with no barcode. I do like how it tracks how much water I drink in the day.",

14333,4,2013-04-23T11:21:05.000Z,mutt49,Good way to keep track of calories.,I use this app as a food journal. It is very easy to use and as you get all your foods picked out it puts them in a list so they are easy to find.It works ok for me.,

14340,3,2012-09-27T19:02:00.000Z,KTALNL,Needs improvement,"This app is really nice, I wish it had bar code scanning ability, but otherwise nice. Unfortunately I haven't been able to use it since ios6, it opens and shuts immediately before I can enter any foods. Tried deleting and reinstalling but it just won't work. I think I'm going to delete it and try a different app.",
14341,4,2012-12-04T15:04:37.000Z,Labph7,Please take it from good to great,"Love the graphics and functionality of this app compared to similar apps!!  However, it's missing a couple of features which would take it from good to great. I wish it had a bar code scanner and option to create personal recipes like ""My Fitness Pal.""  Entering food data is more time consuming and laborious without those features. Would love to see those changes!!",

14344,4,2013-01-14T15:59:51.000Z,Drewpac32,Great App,Great app!  Would rate it 5 stars if they add a bar code scanning function to reduce the need to manually search.,

14346,4,2013-02-02T15:02:20.000Z,LALuNa64,I really like this!,This app has been very helpful to track what I eat and monitor the nutrition ratio. I wish it kept the nutrition pie for all days. Also wish you could select food items directly from your recently eaten list for more.convience. But overall I find this app very useful!,

Not only do they automatically calculate your daily caloric intake goal based on the profile that you fill out with your height, weight, goal weight, age, and gender. One of the greatest features of this application is the database, which contains a plethora of different of foods . I was quite frankly in shock with all of the choices! Let's face it diet is 70% of weight loss  and exercise is the other 30%. That being said we MUST MUST MUST eat healthy, we must never restrict ourselves or use extreme dieting to lose weight. Bottom line is eat when you're hungry and STOP when you're full! This App is a must have !!",

14351,4,2012-04-18T14:15:14.000Z,Crav-en,Great App!,"This app has a huge selection of food items with various portions that you just pick and click into your daily diary. At any time, you can see your calories consumed and in what portions of carbs, fat, etc. I don' feel the app saves enough of your food items that you have previously eaten.It doesn't allow you to load your own bank of foods that you usually eat. It seems to only register/save about 3 days worth of items previously eaten. It would be very convenient to choose from your own bank. It's an easy to use app that gives you an 'eye opening' look at what you've eaten for the day.Just when you thought you were 'being good', surprise! This app helps you realize the good and bad choices you make during your day and helps you stay on track with your weight loss process. I have been loading my own exercises with calories burned. It doesn't seem to have a lot of choices except walking. Maybe the upgrade would include more exercise choices.",
