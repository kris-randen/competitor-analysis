                      Title: So nice and easy to use
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I started mid January on weight watchers and I can honestly say if you’re serious about losing weight and keeping it off this is the way to do it. There’s absolutely no reason to be hungry to set yourself up to fail. There’s room for days when you need to eat or cheat, whatever you’d like to call it. In any event this diet should work for every lifestyle and you should not go hungry. I do not drink alcohol so I don’t know how that factors in but the points are the points. I often time say to myself and my partner, I don’t know how I’m losing weight with all of this fruit that I eat. Sometimes I eat 4 to 6 servings of fruit a day. I also treat myself to the weight watchers snack bar peanut butter and chocolate. It’s like two bites and enough to satisfy the sweet tooth urge for two points. I also had a revelation about microwave popcorn which also is satisfying. I just got a healthy pop from jolly time of 100 cal bags. I was just about to check out the points and the review option came up. Well happy trails to all of you in your journey with weight watchers but I just don’t think you’ll find it all that much of a challenge if you’re a newbie

                      Title: Overpriced, needs improvement
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I decided to give Weight Watchers a try when they offered a reduced cost for an introductory period. I felt I needed a boost to my dietary regimen and also was looking for a way to improve my Type II diabetes numbers. I opted for the 6-month intro, and after 4 months I have, indeed, learned a lot and improved my health and lost weight. HOWEVER! I've also used My Fitness Pal for over 10 years, it's database is superior to the WW database, data entry is more intuitive, and virtually all the same types of community support options are available through MFP as through WW, but for a fraction of the price (if you opt for the MFP paid version, which I prefer to the free version). While using WW, I have simultaneously continued to use MFP, and will continue the lessons I've learned from WW but for much less cost. The WW interface is, I feel, lacking in functionality. I find myself using MFP first, and now only using WW as a check on my carb and fats intake. I've now adjusted my MFP daily nutritional goals to reflect the kinds of goals I learned from WW, so for the limited time I've used WW it was worth it, but not on a continuum.

                      Title: Accountability
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been trying to lose weight forever.  Part of the issue was stress eating.  Retiring from my full-time and part-time job gave me the time and environment to address my weight issue.  I tried numerous different weight loss plans with varying degrees of success.  This was during the Pandemic year.  Finally, after getting fully vaccinated, I decided to get serious and went back to the one plan that had always worked for me in the past—WW.  I never liked the points plans  and preferred the old plans.  But, I decided to try the points plan again and it was a breeze!  I’m on the Blue plan and the app holds me accountable.  I enter my food every day and to date I’ve lost 51 pounds.  The app is quick and accurate.  I can look up food choices and also add new foods to my plan.  Normally, I’m a paper and pen person, but this app is everything and I know it’s going to help me continue on my weight loss journey and help when I reach maintenance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I should have signed up much sooner!  I LOVE this app so much!  I love tracking everything I eat and knowing how many more points I have for the rest of day, etc.  Plus this app gives you flexibility, in addition to providing amazing structure that I NEED.  I love and appreciate the weekly weighing part too because this keeps me in check if I need to adjust a little for the following week.  This app works wonders - lost weight gradually and in a very healthy way!  What a dream come true that I reached my goal in a - happy & healthy way and not from some excessively stressful period.  I will continue to use this app for life because I can’t imagine being without this app now.  Also, I love the WW products too like the snacks (barbecue chips) and the frying Pan too - so many outstanding products!  The motivating navy blue cards I received in the mail for reaching “milestones” with the cute little gifts inside the cards gave me huge boosts too!  Thank you so much WW!

                      Title: Soooo many glitches
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ironically, I’m writing this review because I was prompted to complete a survey about the app when I opened it and the field where I could comment stopped allowing me to type after about 150 characters when it appeared there was unlimited space to comment.  There are constant glitches with this app. I frequently have to uninstall and reinstall to try to fix the issues. Most recently I lost my ability to see my blue dot calendar. When I want to edit a comment or post on Connect the cursor jumps around or the part I’m trying to edit scrolls out of view. Connect feed should default to “Following” or “New” instead of “Trending” or we should at least be able to select our own default. There should be an activity calendar where we can see a more broad snapshot of fitpoints earned per day. Please pass along that WW needs to dump DJ Khaled as spokesperson after the misogynistic comments he made. It’s ridiculous they haven’t made a public statement about this yet as far as I can tell.

                      Title: Used to LOVE the app - before most recent update
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The program is great and I used to LOVE the convenience and user-friendliness of the app. With the most recent update, however, the app’s built-in calculator has changed requiring all nutritional data to be entered rather than just the prior 4 requirements (calories, saturated fat, sugar, and protein). Because I weigh all of my food, and the calculator is more accurate than the barcode scanner or food search, the calculator is the main thing I use in the app and has now created a huge inconvenience. I have reached out to WW and spoken with 5 people who have not been able to fix the issue. I supposedly was escalated to technical support however I am still waiting to hear from them and have yet to get any update on this issue. Ironically, out of the 5 different coaches I spoke to about the issue, none of them had this problem on their app, so I must assume it is due to the most recent update 8.16. Please fix this WW. The app would be 5 stars without this issue.

I had started on Keto and it was ok but not for any long period of time . So, a friend told me who had also been on Keto that she was on the new plan and I needed to take a look . The rest is history .... I’m 74 so losing weight is much harder when you’re in the more mature range ....LOL ! My internist was so shocked that I could lose weight . I told her how WW was so easy and it’s just now my way of life .....so, I know now I have found my new and improved way of eating and can finally conquer my life long weight issues....... I prayed for GOD to help me and WW appeared ! Thank you for being my answer !

                      Title: Review of WW app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love the app. It is so easy to use. I have been a member off and on for years. I have always faithfully tracked my food by writing everything by hand as I did not have a smartphone. In December my son bought both my husband and I new smartphones. I love my new phone and this is my first experience using the app. It is so handy in the grocery store and I feel like I’m telling God what I eat so I’m honest as I can be. Like someone is critiquing me on a daily basis. The reason I didn’t give the app 5 stars is because my doctor wants me to keep tract of my sodium intake and that is the only item I have to do manually. I have checked other apps for sodium and haven’t found a good one yet. Otherwise the WW app is wonderful. Thanks for all the work that clearly has been put into this app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Been using the app for 2 weeks since I joined WW.  Used Lose-it app off and on for several years. I am now tracking on both because I think it is very important to keep up with sodium and cholesterol and I cannot do that on the WW. .  Given the number of older adults in your program, I feel this is an oversight that needs to be corrected.  The first week I only lost 1 lb.  I was in my zone and only went into weekly points one time for about 3 points.  2nd week I started watching sodium by logging on to lose-it.  I lost 4 lbs.    Lose it also connects with the heart app on Apple which does a fabulous job charting all the nutrients for comparison day to day and week to week.  For healthy weight loss, I feel WW falls a little short and I probably will not renew after my 3 mos are up.

                      Title: Surprisingly works great
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m not extremely overweight but I have always been very uncomfortable with the size of body. My mother decided to go into this program and pressured me into doing it as well. I had very little hope of it working and even less once I started and realized it was an easy diet that barely changed what I ate. However I was completely wrong and have been losing so much weight. Only a month in and I’m 1/3rd of the way to my goal even after breaking the diet badly for a whole week. This has been the only diet that’s simultaneously works while not altering my entire life. It’s surprisingly easy to uphold for long periods of time without breaking down and binge eating.

                      Title: Lots of features….
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I find it pretty easy to log my breakfast, lunch, dinner and the available food lists are pretty extensive.  It also allows me to enter and save the points value for recipes I create. I can easily track my progress, shop for WW products, contact support, join an online meeting, access articles and mindset videos, and join an exercise class.  I would give the app 5 stars but for two things: 1) in addition to my daily points, it would be helpful if there was an obvious way to see a daily nutritional rack-up (calories, fat, sodium, fiber, carbs, etc) and 2)  if the app would allow me to enter a recipe then divide it into servings and capture the points value for each serving, not just the whole recipe.

The WW app has been the center of my weight loss, lifestyle change, mindset recalibration, and fitness crush since I decided I can do hard things in December 2019. Since then and throughout the magnificent and stunning 2020, to the now, ever changing new normal of 2021, it has been my precious. Virtual meetings, coaching and Connect are my people and the tides of love that carry me back from the inevitable, periodic backslides. Even though I’ve been on for over a year and a half, I’m still learning new things. (Omg - literally just discovered how to really use the restaurant function last week just in time for a trip to NYC.)

Easy to use. Very intuitive. Love the subtle changes in updates. One suggestion- it’s a big one. I would like to see some enhanced capabilities that you see in other tracking apps. I think the addition of totaling daily fiber, sodium, fats, calories, etc, would really make this app perfect - particular if that information could be framed with the recommended daily amounts for each value. I’ve lost over 30 lbs using this app and will continue to track this way. Now on maintenance, I’m fine tuning my food selections to make sure I’m hitting those specific daily targets, but doing that on paper.

I come from a family that loves fattening food and eats it whenever we want. Thanks to this App I have “broken” my addiction to these foods and been re-educated regarding what foods taste good and make me feel so much better physically every day. Ironically, when I signed up for a 6-month commitment I woke up the next day regretting the financial commitment because I was not committed to weight loss. This App made it so easy to make small commitments to what I eat by providing so many choices that still satisfy me - and some WW treats and Halo ice cream fit into my diet too.  I am now 6 lbs from my goal of losing 60 lbs!

I really do love the app, much easier to track. I do wish sodium was included in the items logged, so that when analyzing a sudden gain, one can look at whether it was a high-sodium factor. I would also love the categories to be totaled at the end of each day, so we can see our total grams of sugar etc, like other apps do, so I don't have to double-log. And I agree with a previous post, would like an easier way to go back to a few former day. I'm going to a restaurant tonight that we went to on Feb 15, and I know it's going to take quite awhile to find that day!

I love the simplicity. And not having to track foods that are good for me as if it is a loss. I had a hard time on other plans where I had to track lettuce and veggies - so I love that this plan celebrates those and treats them like a bonus! One thing I would loooove is a section for each person to put in customizable goals that can be checked off each day. I am doing the plan but I also have another app that has daily details I’m doing to reach my goal: water, vitamins, physical therapy for my ankle, walking, strength training. It would be nice to have one place for me to check them off :) thanks! I love the new version of ww.

I enjoy the many aspects of the app such as: the ability to look back at you week, being able to plan ahead with your meals and points and being able to create recipes and tally points. The things that I wish were different are: that the items for each restaurant should be in alphabetical order, a place to track my vitamin and mineral supplements, tally of nutrients for the day (calories, grams of protein etc) and you should be able to track your servings of fruits, vegetables etc. I also wish that I could manually log my meditation since I use another app.

I signed up for the Weight Watchers program a couple of weeks ago and love it so far! I’ve already lost a couple of pounds. The app especially is convenient for tracking my points and looking for recipes and ideas. I also love it integrates with Apple Health. My one wish though is that there was a way to track nutritional values like protein, vitamins, and stuff. I’ve been using Fooducate for a while as well and would like to be able to get rid of it and use just the Weight Watchers app instead of having to manually enter the same data into  separate apps.

The app works well and has helped me be effective in tracking my daily intake via point count but is not complete. Although it does whats needed in tracking points it does not offer any information on overall nutrition and this should be a part of any diet plan. Since WW lacks this feature, in order to track my overall nutrition in (fat, carbs, protein, as well as vitamins and minerals) I end up having to also enter my foods into my fitness pal. It would be a very welcome addition if WW added this feature or worked with my fitness pal to automatically integrate together.

I might even buy premium. There are just too many free or cheaper things. I’d pay $3-$5 a month but no more. My husband and I like to track together and $40 is ridiculous. There is also no way to stop paying like in regular WW with meetings I could get to goal weight. No incentive.

Yes!  This app is good.  I agree with the most positive reviews that you have read or will read!  But there's something important missing.  I highly recommend that WW improve this app by also calculating vitamin and mineral intake.  The food is already calculated, so let's take it to the next excellent level!  That way, when we see that we are missing certain nutrients, we'll have the information necessary to make adjustments to our diets. After all, WW is all about living to our most healthy potential!  I love WW!!!

I REALLY wish there were more recipes available on it and that there was a way to sort the favorites by type, since I may not remember the exact name of a recipe and therefore have to scroll through the whole list to find it. Connect is a great place to go when my inspiration and desire are low and it’s nice to know it’s a safe environment where I can be truly open and honest about what’s going on in my head (or in my mouth😆).

                      Title: Mystery SP Calculations
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I really do love the app, for the most part. The only quibble I have with it is that the actual calculation of the SP values are not revealed. I know it is based on calories, sat fat and protein but it seems that two different foods with basically the same micro count will have a higher SP value because it is considered a snack food. My WW snacks have the same calorie and fat count as, say, an apple and the WW snack has two points and the apple has zero. It seems like the snack foods are artificially inflated for “nudging” purposes and I really hate being “nudged” I call it being manipulated. Otherwise, the app is great.

The WW program has helped me lose weight.  This app is amazing.  To be the perfect app it needs to give me a daily summary of nutrition. (And if I’m wishing for the stars, a weekly total.)  Total calories, protein, added sugars, sodium, etc.  All of those numbers are available in the app.  I would be able to look back over a day and perhaps see why I felt hungry, or satisfied, or why I stayed within daily points each day but still gained weight.  Please make this the perfect app WW!

I love the app and the ease of use. Everything is organized and easy to find. Connect is very helpful in finding support and others who are changing their lifestyle. However, I would like the app the track macro and micronutrients as well. Something similar to myplate would be nice. Also, the quick track feature is a bit annoying because when I’m trying to slide back a page my finger is in the same place as the food so the app accidentally, automatically tracks that food.

I put my husband, son and I on WW and the results are amazing! Altogether we lost almost 35lbs in 2 months. WW works...period!

Although the app shows Smart Points just fine, it would be nice to have a place to see the calories and macro nutrients in the back end. Diabetes need to track carbs. Hypertension and heart disease suffers need to track sodium. Not just ingredient by ingredient, but also for the day. Plus, it would help if we could see total calories which might keep us from leaning on nothing but zero points. I've tracked in other apps, and when I'm hoping to eat 1400 calories I end up at 1600 or more.

I look at the other app when I’m hungry to see what I’m low on that day and then choose that. My two cents. I think some people just worry about points and not balance. Can help stop cravings too.

It has become unstable, it loses data I’ve input, and does not operate according to the settings I’ve input into my profile.  It is also expensive for what you get after the introductory period.  The concept is sound:  measurement of food and beverage intake, and measurement of exercise.  The formula works but I’m sure there’s a better, more economical app out there than WW.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Being diabetic, it’s important for me to be able to monitor my sugar and carbs throughout the day. It would be extremely helpful if the app provided us with a summary of nutrients (similar to the my fitness pal app). It would also help to track sodium intake, etc. Being able to adjust these levels would make this the PERFECT app!
