                      Title: New/improved version - So easy to use!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app! It has really opened my eyes to see what foods I was feeding my family. It is so easy (and fun) to adjust your personal/family diet settings, and then search for products that match what you are looking for. When you open the app, it automatically shows several products that are good matches for you.

                      Title: I have never reviewed an app but this one deserves it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have to be on a strict diet while breastfeeding my daughter and this app has been a lifesaver. The amount of ‚Äúhidden‚Äù ingredients that exist out there is crazy and this app helps keep me from spending all day in the grocery store reading labels.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This thing is awesome tells me what has milk in it and helps me from having allergic reaction. And from what I've read people who gave one star don't know what there saying when it's says that it has something like milk or gluten its true some manufactures don't list it or say dairy free but have milk I found a creamer that was dairy free but had dairy and had a allergic reaction. So don't listen to those people who gave it one star. This thing is a life saver. just take your time and learn to use it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! This ap is a life-saver for me and my family, trying to manage feeding a toddler with multiple food allergies! Especially love that you can scan products, search for them, and even find alternatives. It even scores them nutritionally AND tells you where you can find items nearby. Makes "reading" labels so much easier!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I live the app for myself... I have scanned a few items for my son (10 months) like these yogurt melts and teethers. I realize the app isn't meant for baby type food but would be nice of there was some option for those. We homemake mostly everything so the snack type stuff we could use a little guidance on. One item I have removed from my diet after using this- fig nutons!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the app now to lose the weight gained during pregnancy. Also continuing to manage carb intake due to high numbers during post-pregnancy glucose challenge. Really important to manage now to avoid getting type 2 diabetes making this app a lifesaver. Really loving the fact that I can now see what stores have he products I want.

                      Title: Great app, BUT...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is excellent in how it caters to specific dietary needs, but it definitely needs to improve in accuracy. For example, I have an allergy to soy, so I use almond milk instead. When I scan the barcode for the almond milk, it lists it as containing soy, even though the ingredients say otherwise. I would recommend this app to anyone who doesn't have specific food allergies until they get more precise.

                      Title: One of my favorite apps!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I absolutely love this app- I rely on it while grocery shopping now because of the barcode scanner. I have a lactose intolerance and I find this app incredibly helpful in alerting me to finding hidden milk and dairy. If you have a food allergy or always try to find the healthiest item out there in a sea of choices, you NEED this app.

Nice looking app and pretty useful in terms of helping me find healthier food options. I was trying to compare various brands of chocolate milk (my trainer üí™ says it's a good workout recovery drink) the other day and I was able to find a brand that's better than the one I bought.

Wish it had a section for vegans. Also it listed things as containing whey/milk but the ingredients on the bread did not list milk or whey :-( Not sure who I should be mad at Shopwell for falsifying ingredients or the bread company for withholding ingredients...

                      Title: Do NOT trust gluten results, GLUTEN RESULTS NOT ACCURATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

It only looks for listed label allergen warnings. Milky Way, for instance, says it's a weak match & safe because it doesn't list wheat but it DOES CONTAIN MALTED BARLEY. Barley contains GLUTEN-wheat-rye-barley... can't have any of those if you're allergic to gluten. I have Celiac Disease & this app is VERY UNSAFE!!!
