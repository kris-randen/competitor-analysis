                      Title: Husband lost 70 lbs just tracking calories
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was using a different app that my PT was using. I told my husband to get an app like this. Once he got MyPlate and he was tracking his calories he realized more of what he was eating. He was better able to avoid foods that were full of empty calories and keeping track of his foods helped him see what was making him sick and what didn‚Äôt. It tracks carbs, sugars, fats, sodium, and proteins. (More than this but that‚Äôs all we use). Once he realized how much he was actually eating he started making better choices a little at a time. He wanted to see how much he could lose before he started working out and he quickly lost 60lbs. He found that he was eating more than 10,000 empty calories before. Now he keeps it to under 2,000net calories. (It subtracts calories burnt that are tracked with his iWatch- I have an iFITNESS. Which is much cheaper and it syncs to this app as well). He loves it. It‚Äôs like a game to him.  I tell everyone about this app because I‚Äôm so proud of him. Literally, all the motivation he needed was to be shown how much garbage he was eating. Now, because he‚Äôs eating less processed sugar, his sores heal faster, he‚Äôs off his gout medication,($200/month) and we‚Äôre hoping he‚Äôll be off his bp meds next visit. His teeth are in better condition without all the soda. He can‚Äôt even stand to eat all the junk because it makes him sick. LOVE THIS APP!

                      Title: A decent tracking app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I like many of the features of this app. It offers good macro tracking and some vitamin/mineral tracking. It‚Äôs simple to enter your food and I do find most of the products I use are listed, with a few exceptions. The search feature is lacking a bit. A lot of times I can type exactly the name of a product into the search and it won‚Äôt find it, and sometimes just pulls up weird totally unrelated stuff. Often I have to scan the barcode to find things. Overall I think the use of this is generally fairly intuitive and more simple in layout than similar apps like MyFitnessPal. It took me a minute to figure out the excercise tracking, which I think could be set up a little better (for ease of use, the same setup as the food logging) but it‚Äôs not hard to use.

                      Title: Almost perfect
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The app is very useful when it comes to logging meals and being able to keep track of my calories. I love that it shows me my macro total percentage-ages for the day as well. Micronutrient info and daily goals are neat but not totally necessary esp with the sodium thresholds and such available to view online. However, it is a very common and free feature of other meal tracking apps to be able to create a meal (with however many servings of individual ingredients)  and then say how many servings that meal makes. Unfortunately, with My Plate when you click on a meal you‚Äôve made, it lists all of the ingredients individually. This makes it very tedious, if not impossible, to accurately input homemade recipes. This is very annoying since I do a lot of cooking at home and meal prepping. I would love to see this one feature changed. Other than that this app is great - especially including all of the online features it allows you to input about your starting point with your body measurements along with weight. The graphs are encouraging. I‚Äôd love to give 5 stars when I‚Äôm able to make my own ‚Äúserving‚Äù sizes for homemade meals!

                      Title: Good when starting out but food list needs updating and expansion
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app has been helpful in terms of forcing me to track everything that passes my lips and being aware of what I'm eating. I also find the chat helpful for the most part. My biggest problems with the app are the food list and the exercise list. The food list needs to be updated more often to add foods and needs to include mixed food made from scratch. For example, I made a bag of mixed dry beans with low fat reduced sodium chicken broth last night. I had to add each kind of bean one at a time, add the broth, add the onions, celery, etc. and then estimate how much I ate of each item. Ugh. The exercise app needs an overhaul and to include more types of everyday activities as exercise. I have lost 5 pounds so far. I am about a month in now and for the most part I still feel this is a fairly good app for tracking your foods and macros. I feel less positive about the chat portion and I've decided not to use that aspect of the app any longer. There is 1 person in particular who thinks he is Gods gift to the food and diet world and I've grown tired of his incredibly nasty approach to everyone. He's The school yard bully.

                      Title: Food log problems
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I would probably stop using MyFitnessPal and switch to this, but there are some huge issues with this app. That I believe can be easily fixed. As far as food logging, I have to constantly make "my own food" because the bar codes i can or items I search for are not being found, this gets really annoying and begins to be a huge waste of time. With the other app I am able to find and scan in all the items, that I can't with this app which makes it much easier and faster. Also when I precede to "add my food" because I'm now forced to because of the lack of food items within the app, it only asks for fat, protein and carbs, which I find to not be enough information as far as nutrition, on MyFitnessPal, it asks me for sodium, fiber, sugar, vitamins, etc. which I think makes more sense. I'm not sure if this is only with the basic version ü§î.

                      Title: I highly recommend this but have some pet peeves
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have used this app on and off for years. I love being able to go back and see my history. My foods and meals are saved. I am not sure if recipes I added years ago are there. My frustration with the new version: I see photos of foods under recipes. But I cannot click on them. I went to the recipe page and typed spicy cauliflower wings in the search. Nothing happened. What a teaser! My other frustration: I eat almost no processed foods. When I type in a food, the corporate foods come up first. So I must always be typing in the word homemade, like homemade pasta. Yes we make our own pasta. And I would pay for the gold version if it calculated calcium. As a Medicare adult, I need 1200 units of calcium a day. My bone density is on the borderline. I need to count and don‚Äôt want all of it to come from supplements. I bet a lot of women would appreciate this addition for their health.

                      Title: Great Tracker but Needs Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently switched to My Plate from Noom because I have a medical condition that requires me to more closely track certain nutrients. Sodium is a big one for me. I like that My Plate sets a sodium limit for the day and shows my progress so I always know how close I am to my daily limit. However, if I customize my sodium limit, the line graph showing progress doesn‚Äôt work. Also, the last two days, looking at my daily totals by individual day, it looks like I stayed well under my limits. However, I just looked at the progress for the last week and selected sodium. That view shows that I exceeded the sodium limit the last two days. The mg counts are much higher than they show for each day. I have no idea which is right. I don‚Äôt see an option to ask anyone about it. I was so excited when I found that My Plate tracking was so detailed, now I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs not reliable.  I hope this gets fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Joining MyPlate is one of the smartest things I've ever done! By using their easy to use App I have successfully lost 55 pounds. Now, this didn't happen magically and it didn't happen without my being faithful to using MyPlate but it was indeed a pleasurable way to drop a good amount of unwanted, ugly pounds! I have been dedicated to MyPlate for about 8 months and it truly is a joy to use! I actually look forward to entering what goes into my mouth and it encourages me to choose my foods wisely. Prior to using MyPlate my carb intake was atrocious and I ate hardly any protein! Now, I'm better! MyPlate makes it easy for me to track my intake of protein, carbs, sodium and my favorite...WATER!!!

                      Title: Good for tracking calories but not much else
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I use the free version and have considered upgrading to get the ‚Äòadvanced stats‚Äô, but I realized that much of the ‚Äòbasic‚Äô info the app provides you is incorrect. For instance, yesterday I ate 1 pound of 75/25 beef, which according to this app contained 0.38mg of cholesterol, though in reality that number is 340mg. Similarly, when I log my breakfast of 2 carrots, 2 eggs, and 2 cups broccoli, I am told that I have had 0.3mg of sodium, when the real amount is 260mg. These issues only come up when I have to manually enter those foods whose barcodes aren‚Äôt recognized, but unfortunately that is most of what I eat. The calorie counts are always more or less accurate, so if that‚Äôs what your looking for in an app, this will meet your needs. However, if you want more detailed nutritional information, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

                      Title: Best tracking app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôd been using Lose it for a year but I felt like I was stagnating with it. So I decided to try this one out, and it‚Äôs so much better. I love how it breaks everything down for you in terms of how much sodium and whatnot you‚Äôre eating, not just calories. And it allows you to track water intake as well without charging you to do so, Lose It requires you to go premium to do that. This app also connects rather seamlessly to the health app that comes on your iPhone, and gives you an idea of how many calories you‚Äôre burning instead of just saying ‚Äútake this many steps and get a calorie bonus‚Äù like Lose It does. I find this feature much more useful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Stick with the free version. I paid to upgrade so that I could adjust my daily nutritional limits (carbs 70, fat 60, 400 cholesterol etc.) it shows where to do this. but it won‚Äôt change, goes right back to what it was. After several messages back & forth (there is no phone number listed) I was told I can change the daily % but cannot adjust each individual goal. I wanted to set daily limits based on a keto plan but can‚Äôt. So at the end of the day I see I had 70% carbs 20% protein &10% fat. I wanted to see the adjusted breakdown 85 g carbs, 45 G protein, 30 g fat, 1600 sodium, 450 cholesterol, 10 g sugar, etc. why offer a means to change something if it doesn‚Äôt work.  (All numbers or percentages are for explanation only). Not happy with paid upgrade. Not happy with the means to contact them.

I love this app, but I find it to be tedious sometimes due to some items after scanning not being updated in a year or two.

Another thing is since applying in the app for the Stronger Meal Plan, the emails haven‚Äôt worked. I signed up, waited for the Sunday before the start date to receive my email, and received nothing. After checking my spam for almost a week, I signed up again and waited for the emails. I finally received an email, but it‚Äôs the one for day 3. I hope these things get fixed.

Of course you do have to exercise but what you eat is important too.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the meal plan that comes with the bought version is ridiculously bland and lacks creativity and flavor. Also I wish it had complete nutritional information at least for common vegetables that includes all vitamins and minerals.

Pretty good app overall, but I‚Äôd like to suggest adding 1/8 serving size when logging food. The lowest is 1/4, and other competing apps go down to 1/8 serving. Also, when creating a meal, I‚Äôd like to be able to divide that into serving sizes. Right now you just add food to the meal and it gives you the total calories for the ENTIRE meal rather than letting you divide it into servings. Laatly, when creating a new food, I‚Äôd love it if I could add saturated fat, sugar, sodium, and fiber instead of just macros. If these things were added I‚Äôd definitely give it 5 stars!

However, at this stage I‚Äôm not convinced that the calories are accurate either. If it isn‚Äôt able to calculate the sodium correctly how do I know it‚Äôs tracking the calories correctly. Or anything else. I am just super frustrated by this. Please fix this!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was excited for this app because it thought it would be a wonderful tool to help me get my BP on track by being able to see my sodium intake vs my potassium intake. I purchased the one month subscription and was disappointed to discover that ‚Äúverified‚Äù products didn‚Äôt list all the macronutrients that they do on the packaging and the app wouldn‚Äôt allow me to add them to the ‚Äú verified‚Äù product or going in a creating the food item myself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey MyPlate, I love the app, and it helps me manage my diet in many ways. But, there are two things I wish you would add. First off, when you add in your weight for the day, it changes the amount of calories needed for all days, including past recorded days. This makes it difficult to look back and reflect on how you‚Äôve progressed and such. Second off, I don‚Äôt know if this is in gold, but if it‚Äôs not, could you add in some sort of way to watch vitamins, minerals, fruits, and vegetables or something along those lines? Thank you!

They also break down how much carbs protein and fat you eat in each meal and daily. If any food is too high in sugar or sodium you can see it on the consumption break down.

The latest upgrade of this app, with its *revamped* progress section has rendered it useless. I‚Äôve been using it for years and found the detail for tracking progress over time, especially for maintaining weight, quite helpful. I often go long periods of time without entering information, and the app used to provide the ability to check in once in a while and be able to maintain a record. The *simplified* and utterly truncated visuals and timeline are not worthless. I will be looking for another tracking app.

I was on vacation from work for the first week or so of tracking so I had plenty of time to find an input items in my regular diet. The app allows you to input foods that aren‚Äôt in its database under the ‚ÄúMy Foods‚Äù category and to create custom meals or groupings of food as well. Adding custom foods is fairly easy if you have a product label on hand. I wish that function had a separate ‚Äúbrand‚Äù field so you didn‚Äôt have to try and include it in the item name. I‚Äôd also like there to be a field to track added sugar in nutrition values. Although, not all labels separate that out, so I get it. I found the ‚ÄúMy Meals‚Äù option more cumbersome. In order to create a meal, you have to start from scratch with your food entry. It would be nice to have a repopulated list of items we‚Äôve logged before to start with. And, once in a meal, can you edit case by case? If I eat my normal salad, but switch to a dressing with a different nutrient profile, I can‚Äôt just make a one-time change. Also, I found branded foods listed as ‚Äúverified‚Äù under multiple slightly different names and nutrient profiles. All of these suggestions are small in the grand scheme. It has helped me get a very realistic view of my portions, amounts, and macronutrient balances. A month in, I‚Äôm still leaning. I just realized, for example, that I can adjust my own macronutrient goals under my profile information.

                      Title: Great app but some annoying things
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I really like this app more than other trackers because it feels more inclusive than most but there are a few things that are really irritating. First, when trying to add a food I frequently get a message saying "sorry we are unable to add a food at this time. Please try again later." I don't know what that's about or why it happens - it's completely random, sporadic and annoying. Second, when doing a quick add, you can't add essential items like sodium or fiber but it's often the only option I have when I keep getting the above message and can't add it the other way. Third, it automatically deducts your activity calories burned from the amount you ate. I wish there were an option so that I could track my activity without having it subtract that amount from what I ate - I still ate that much. Just because I did a lot of activity shouldn't give me license to eat a whole bunch more. That's not how weight loss works. Lastly, I wish I could set my own carbohydrate limit instead of theirs which just seems arbitrary and excessive. Would love this app and give it 5 stars if these things got fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Years ago I got my degree in dietetics. However, five kids later I found that the pounds had snuck up over the years. I was exercising and eating nutritious foods for the most part, but still wasn't losing weight. That's when I got back to the basics and started using this app to determine calories in and calories out.  I was able to set a weight goal and am working towards it. I have had great results, and I feel like this is something I can do.  I plan to use it daily for a month until I use a few pounds and then adjust the calories for the next month to maintain.  I do not plan on using it daily long term.  I think it is helpful to bring attention to how many calories one is eating comparatively.  I like that it breaks it breaks down the intake of macronutrients, but I wish that it also showed micronutrients consumed.  Overall, it is a great tool to use.

The app is wonderful!It's is very useful on a day to day basic, but there are still some improvement that could be made. For example, the nutrients it tracks. It only follows the protein, fat, and carbs although there are other nutrients that are just as important and should be included in the pie chart. It would be very beneficial if it also tracked the total number of cholesterol, sodium, dietary fiber and/or sugars as well. And maybe let the user individualize what they want to track in the daily pie chart. That would be amazing! Considering people may have to monitor certain nutrients in order to maintain their health (Like a heart attack survivor would have to monitor their cholesterol and sodium).

This app has a great community, everyone is incredibly supportive, helpful, and welcoming. There is a free version of the app, and a "gold" version that you pay for. I have the free version, and it includes all the features and functions I need/want. This is a vast improvement from a different app I tied, which marketed itself as free, yet didn't let you even enter meals without paying for the "pro" version. MyPlate is very easy to use, and you can customize your daily calorie, macronutrient (carbs, protein, fat), sodium, cholesterol, sugar, and dietary fiber goals. You can also set these to automatic, and it calculates daily goals based on height, weight, activity level, long-term goal (gain, lose, or maintain weight), and other factors. Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a free, comprehensive nutrition tracker with a great community you can go to for help and support.

Not only does it keep me on track at home but I traveled recently to Maine for a job interview. I was able to find 100% of all the items I ate in the airport, room service, and other meals! While I exceeded my daily caloric goals, the app helped me to make healthy choices and not stray too far off the mark!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I really like the simple interface design and workouts but I had to delete this and get "Lose It" instead since it has some functionality dealbreakers for me that's not offered. 1) I don't like how when adding a food entry, it doesn't allow me to add all the details such as sodium and vitamins. It seems this app is primarily concerned with carbohydrates, fats, and sugars only... which I understand however that's not for me because I like to take into account the whole nutritional profile. So when something I'd like to track has high sodium, but displays 0 sodium since there was no option to edit that when I was adding the entry... that information becomes false (misleading) and ultimately confusing and thus useless to me. 2) I'm a visual person and I did not see the option to add pictures of my food and/or body...

Glad that the update has been fixed to where I can now see my macros consumed instead of just macros left. The new update feels "watered down". Glad also to have the info button back again to see my micro totals (sugar, fiber, etc.). I'm now having to use My Fitness Pal but I hate the ads. MyPlate used to knock the socks off of MFP; please make the newest version of the app go away. Also, I really hate that I can no longer scroll down and see my meals logged. I have to click on the meal to see details. Even MFP lets you scroll down to see your totals! Please fix these annoying aspects of your update.

I also wished there were more information on tracking nutrition rather than simply calories, fat and protein. I'm using this app to keep track of what I eat to ensure that I am getting the nutrients I need. It'd be great if there were an app that helped me keep track of the important vitamins I consume.

The scan barcode option makes it so easy to enter the food I have eaten and their database has almost every grocery store item in it. It may not always have the same brand but you can always find the same food. Whether you want to track calories, carbs, fat, sugar, sodium and more it is all stored in your profile.  (Besides tracking your weight of course).

Overall, the free version is good if you just want to be more conscious of your eating habits.

If Livestrong would just add that function, they would have a perfect nutrition app.

It seems pretty limited.  For example - there is water aerobics, water Zumba, water yoga, water circuit training and this is true for land classes too. You should add Cize, Barre, circuit training, PiYo and more. It's not all about lifting weights.

This is the most useful app I've found for me to track exercise and calories. To me, what would make it perfect is for me to be able to track calcium. I need to keep up with this to prevent osteoporosis and would love to be able to keep up with my daily intake here. I suggest having the option to track certain nutrients and electrolytes, for those who need to keep up with sodium for blood pressure, etc.

This app will keep one in check and let you know how you're doing as far as nutrients. If you're trying to cut sugar - see exactly where you stand. Need less sodium? Know exactly what you've had. It's excellent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app appears to give incorrect daily totals.I went back over everything I ate three times and nothing had more than a negligible amount of sodium. Somehow it shows I consumed over 1,600mg of sodium. Readings on carbs and fat don't add up either. I only ate 1,400 calories on a vegetarian diet, so how could I surpass the RDA for fat, carbs and protein? Not very useful.

It doesn't account for sodium vitamins or nutrients. Not a good calorie counter if your goal is all around good health. I deleted it

                      Title: Great for tracking P,C & F, not so much for Na and exercise
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I like using the app for food input to track calories and macro's. The "My Foods" option is an excellent timesaver for us who eat the same things each day. Unfortunately, the sodium levels of foods in the database is often very far off (e.g, fish sauce, which has 1500mg of Na per Tbsp. is listed as having close to zero even when scanning the bar code of the bottle and when entering a new food manually, only PF and C are options. I tried the exercise input to see net calorie balance but the calories burned seemed excessive: i.e. Many days in a row I had a negative calorie balance but went up in weight.

                      Title: Excellent App
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Helped me to see how many calories I was eating in a day by tracking those in between snacks that added up over the day. When I thought I was eating around 1800-2000 I was actually eating around 3000. No wonder I couldn‚Äôt lose weight. Just tracking alone helped me lose 40lbs without exercise. Then I was able to tweak my micronutrients to get healthier as well. Love Love Love this app!!!

                      Title: Nice But Some Problems
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Doesn‚Äôt track sodium or cholesterol in practice because many ‚Äúverified‚Äù food listings do not include that info. The current ‚Äúverified‚Äù listing for chicken thighs, for example, says they have zero cholesterol - this is not accurate. Also I have had repeated issues with connectivity to iPhone motion and activity data. I have to reset this again and again. Further the program doesn‚Äôt follow progress longer than a year. Good points are that the interface is very friendly, fast, easy and fun. It‚Äôs workable if you don‚Äôt mind paying $44.99 to get basic info like calories.

                      Title: App review
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is really great and helpful .It tells you how much calories ,Fats,sodium levels ,etc you should be getting.It also gives you great workouts that have turned me sore but are define you helping .I haven't lost any pounds yet ,but I'm getting there. I also like how it helps you and reminds you to track your food intake . The food options are unlimited and it has found almost all of the foods I have eaten .This app is great but there are a few things that may make it better .I think it should tell you lists of certain diets that have worked for other people because it may help others .It should also give you workouts that a specifically for certain body parts .That way then the app may work better and people would start seeing results fastest. Fast results=Inspired people. Inspired people = people to keep using the app.
