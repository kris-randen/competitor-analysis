                      Title: Lost 47 pounds already this year
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fitness pal works so well for me. It doesn't judge. It just records facts. I committed to telling it everything except the occasional milk in coffee. I am creating new habits and I didn't quit the first time I was at an unexpected party and went over by 1700 calories that day. I acknowledged that this was the first exception to my new habits and not my habit. I still lost weight that week. Yes, the two pound loss for had targeted. This week was the first week I maintained my weight since April. Every other week has been a loss. I'm totally okay with that. I still log everything. I exercise six days a week. Swim or bike or walk. I counted my 4 hours of volunteer bar tending yesterday as a two hour leisurely walk. It's all good. MyFitnessPal is my pal in this endeavor and I give it the highest rating because it is always there, consistent, and ready to record my steps along the way, be they baby steps or giant leaps of progress. My blood pressure mess are down, I'm no longer prediabetic and my liver enzymes are way down. My fatty liver is also losing weight. If you work it, it will be work for you. üòç

                      Title: Easy to use and lose!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The only way I lose weight is when I‚Äôm counting all my calories. With this app on my phone, I can always do that. I set my goal of 2 lbs loss per week, and I love the graph that displays showing my progress each time I enter a new weight. The only thing I would ask the developer to improve is the recipe section, where you can add some recipe you eat all the time, such as a salad with 5 or 6 ingredients. This makes it much easier to add that same recipe to your food intake another time. But today I tried to enter my breakfast and it kept trying to leave the recipe page as I entered ingredients - Kodiak Buttermilk Cakes, skim milk, 1 egg. When I finally finished it, it had the correct calorie count, but it said I ate 14 g of protein, and that‚Äôs just for the Kodiak mix. The total protein should have been 21 g. But overall this app seems to enter accurate info (outside of the recipe function), and I find it extremely useful for calorie counting, weight loss, and keeping track of protein intake when I‚Äôm working out.

                      Title: Can‚Äôt live without
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôve been a yo-yo dieter for a good portion of my life.  One thing I can‚Äôt stand is going on a diet, because then I sabotage myself by having something that is not ‚Äúon plan.‚Äù  With MyFitnessPal, everything is ‚Äúon plan,‚Äù because I‚Äôm holding myself accountable.  I know I shouldn‚Äôt want or give into the need to have a cookie, but I‚Äôm human, and I do.  By tracking my food, I am more than satisfied with my one (or two üòá) cookies because I know what happens when I eat more and that it‚Äôs not going to help me lose weight.  Every time I get back on MyFitnessPal, I lose weight.  I lost 50 lbs. in a little over 6 months to get pregnant with my son.  Well, I fell into the pregnancy cravings, and then went through a lot of stress eating after having him to the point that I gained 75 pounds back.  I‚Äôm back on MyFitnessPal for about 6 months now and I‚Äôm down 40 pounds.  Yes, I still have a lot to go, but I know I‚Äôm going to get there because this works.  It‚Äôs not a diet, it‚Äôs a lifestyle change.

I have followed Brooke Ence for years and she has always shared her fitness journey and how she tracks macros. I had a baby in 2017... at first I couldn‚Äôt lose the weight so I started weighing food but I wasn‚Äôt tracking. About a year and 3 months ago I made the decision to actually commit to tracking my macros by using this app... it has worked wonders for me when I eat clean and when I‚Äôve chosen to work eat dirty. The app itself has cool features. Scanning items is a life saver and if you flip the phone whilst viewing your diary for the day you can view your macro breakdown. I enjoy this app I‚Äôve looked to use others but have ultimately chosen to just use this app cause it AWESOME!!

                      Title: Freezes Constantly
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been using MyFitnessPal for nearly ten years. It has helped me lose weight for my wedding, manage my calories when I was diagnosed with a chronic illness, and get back on track after having a baby. I do absolutely love MFP. However, the glitches with the app do not seem to improve. Syncing with my fitness tracker has been an issue for some time. Duplicating entries and ingredients within recipes happens from time to time. Recently, my app freezes after adding or editing more than one item in the diary. The app force closes while trying to create new recipes (so frustrating!). I'm getting to the point where I may have to try out a new tracker because the app is not functioning as it should.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm just using the free version for now and it's really really good. My fave feature is the ability to scan products and instantly see the calories and other details. It helps me make wiser feeding choices and stick to my caloric goals for the day. Also when I go over my daily caloric limit, I work out, input the details on the app and balance out the calories so I'm always on track. I've been fasting intermittently for a week now and I use this app to track and document my feeding. So far I've lost 3.2kg by sticking to under 1200 calories daily. Summary of the story, MyFitnessPal is awesome üíÉ

                      Title: Pregnancy
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been an avid user on and off for years. The day I found out I was pregnant I committed back to using it to maintain a healthy pregnancy and track what I‚Äôm eating in case of any complications to report to the doctor. I love this app and it helped me my entire pregnancy and now will help me lose the minimal weight I did gain. My one complaint about the app, is that it does not have a way to report you‚Äôre pregnant to take additional calories into consideration. Also post pregnancy needs to consider breastfeeding mamas. They can easily update that and should.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app has helped me lose weight before and I am starting again after baby. I recently downloaded LOSE IT! and found their visuals more appeasing, and their goals interesting, and they also have badges and rewards for things MFP doesn‚Äôt which makes it more fun and inviting. You also don‚Äôt lose your days logged if you can‚Äôt log a day (like if you‚Äôre camping). Their premium also costs less, but you pay for some of the things that MFP has for free in their basic that I enjoy and use. Also, MFP connects better to my tracker than they do. So in short, if I could transfer my 5 years of MFP to LI! I would be theirs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The concept of mfp is amazing and so helpful. I‚Äôve been using it for years. After my last pregnancy I got the app again and this time around it‚Äôs frustratingly slow and buggy to use. The desktop site works fine though. I would never consider going premium when the free version is barely functional. If mfp ever went full premium I would find another service, even if I had to pay for the alternative. If they ever figure out how to speed the app back up I think they will find many more premium customers...but it‚Äôs been months of this for me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I turned to MFP out of desperation at my inability to plan and stick to a healthy eating plan in order to shed stuck-on baby weight that was lingering on long after my kids were babies anymore. I cannot believe the amount of calories I must've consumed on a daily basis before using MFP. I lost 3 lbs in the first 10 days simply by being held accountable for my food intake. Wow. I'm still on my 40-50 lb weight loss journey and I don't know if I could have realistically done this without this amazing and helpful app!

Great app for the busy person who doesn‚Äôt have time to make sure they have specific kinds of food that fit into a diet plan. Keeps track of calories, and other nutritional info where provided. Easy to use barcode scanner to quickly add item to diary. Also can keep track of water intake and excersise. Can be synced with many activity trackers including your phone, Fitbit, and Apple Watch. I would give it 5 stars if it had an option to adapt for a breastfeeding Mom who generally needs about an extra 300 calories a day.

I started using this app for a college course and later in life I stopped using it during my two pregnancies. Now, I am using it again because I know it worked before. It‚Äôs the perfect app! I put in a goal and just stay right around my calorie limit and I've been losing weight! I haven't changed really what I would have been eating, but It makes me more aware of what and how much I‚Äôm consuming! I also love seeing the 5 week projection at the end of each day!!

I feel confident that I can achieve my goal using this app!

I wish this app would have a feature that helps calculate calorie needs for breastfeeding women. I love that you can select your activity level and how many pounds you want to lose (and how fast), but I hate having to use other websites to calculate my calorie needs because I‚Äôm breastfeeding.

You could pick your serving or how many, and it would tell you the calories. I don‚Äôt see an option for this anymore. Just scanning of the codes and ‚Äòrecent, frequent, my foods, meals and recipes.

It‚Äôs very quick and convenient for adding up the calories. It does all the work for you. And it‚Äôs free!

I lost 20 lbs for my wedding using this and now I'm using it to take off the baby weight. It's so helpful to keep me mindful of what I'm eating, and it inspires me to exercise so I can have those calories to spend. I only wish that every time I log an exercise it didn't take away the calories I earned from walking throughout the day. My phone tracks my steps but I'm not holding it while I'm workin out... stop stealing my calories! I earned those!

The feature to enter a recipe has significant problems, at least 3 problems.  When searching for ingredients it does not find things I had already scanned, like 2% milk (#1).  So I scanned it again but it claimed the barcode was invalid (like I said, I already had scanned it successfully - #2).  Once it finds an invalid barcode it bails out of the recipe without saving any of the entered  information (#3). Still, a pretty good app!

I downloaded the app again to track my calories during pregnancy because I was having a hard time eating enough. I would rate this app 5 stars if it was working properly.

                      Title: My opinion
--------------------------------------------------------------------

As someone older and overweight, I find it frustrating that they only show perfectly buff 20-30 year olds.  For example ‚Äúrunners cross training, and common ‚Äúplank‚Äù mistakes. I don‚Äôt mind these thing but I would like to see an older fatter person giving motivation ideas too. There are so many baby boomers trying to stay healthy, not leaning how to do a better plank. Wish my fitness would have an over 50 app. I‚Äôd pay for that

I was stuck and couldn‚Äôt loose the last 10 pounds of my pregnancy weight. I got the free version,  started counting my calories with the app... I started to loose 1lb a week just as they said. Slowly but surely! Being more aware of what I eat was a game changer. I totally recommend this app. You have nothing to loose, it‚Äôs free!

My nutritionist wanted me to download this app to track my eating habits. Unfortunately half of the stuff I try to input can‚Äôt be entered correctly. For example, I ate Hamburger Helper last night.

Additionally I have to make it with 2 1/3 cups of milk, it won‚Äôt let me enter the right value. I will be trying other apps. I used it for over a month and it is garbage.

There‚Äôs a lot to love about this app. It‚Äôs clearly the best nutrition and fitness tracker for multiple reasons. The only concern I have is that it doesn‚Äôt deduct breastfeeding from your calories on the app but does on the website, so much so that you‚Äôll get two different estimates for what you‚Äôll weigh in 5 weeks depending on whether you complete the entry on the app or the website. (Giving 1 star to get developers‚Äô attention... will update to 5 when it‚Äôs fixed)

The developer completely forget about human intake of liquids...the most common beverages such as coffee, milk, juice, soda, and alcohol are not built into the app.  You have to create a category on your own.  IMO the app is 50% incomplete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app has always been backed by an incredibly robust database of food nutrition information, which is undoubtedly its greatest strength. They‚Äôve also made it possible to copy meals from other dates (and friends with whom you‚Äôve connected), which is good when you eat leftovers from the previous night‚Äôs for lunch, or when you eat the same meal as your wife. If you often eat the same foods together (milk and cereal for example), and you add one, it will offer to let you add the other at the same time, without having to look it up.

                      Title: Great! Wish it would account for pregnancy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a great application. I've been using it to track my diet because I want to make certain I'm eating all the right foods while I'm pregnant. While pregnant women should not technically diet, this is a prefect application to stay on top of your meals and make sure your nutritional intake is balanced. It's also great to be able to show your doctor your food intake if needed. My only reservation is that you can't add pregnancy as any sort of prerequisite or condition. According to a health journal I read, only 85 extra calories per day are needed in the first trimester, 285 extra calories per day are needed in the second, and 485 additional calories per day are required during the third trimester. While it's simple enough to calculate this, it would be awesome if this app accounted for pregnancy related weigh gain. Regardless, I'm at 14 weeks and my doctor is very happy with my vitals thus far. Additionally, I still fit into all my regular clothes. They are just snug in the waist as expected. I attribute this app to the fact that I'm not overcompensating and look/feel great (for being pregnant). My husband is so impressed that he's now thinking of using it to drop a few holiday pounds.

                      Title: Amazing Potential
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Would give 6 stars but this app is just not sexy or useful without digging deep. The front page is bland and totally unappealing. It should be a modern dashboard with vitals not a information feed. I am not a baby and want my dashboard not congratulations messages taking up real estate. The food database is A+ and live the way you can scan food in. Graph choices are.....one. % of fat to carbs to protein. Who cares? I want options of % carbs to max allowable for example. Or % of calcium to max allowable. Someone made the wrong call that we only want to measure fat, carbs and protein against themselves. Really? Again I am not a baby and want to USE the amazing data that this program has to offer in ways THAT I CHOOSE. It's the best out there but just not good looking at all or configurable. It's sad. Someone needs to redesign this app. We are adults not 10 year olds. The social media and coaching focus in the daily feed is annoying to some like me. I want an app like this only one that lets ME focus on how I am going to lose weight, not one that assumes there is only one way. For example I am loosing a pound a day using low carb approach. Not much room for that in this app. There needs to be space for me to adjust my own approach and for me to turn off all the noise of the feed. The interface needs to catch up with the database.

                      Title: Useful tracking of calories and more!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I started using this app 3 years ago when I weighed over 200lbs. I had no idea what my caloric intake was and was gaining weight every year from not paying attention. I lost 65lbs in a year by watching how many calories I was eating. The next year I started getting into fitness more because I was down to the "trouble" spots and learned about macronutrients and how it can dramatically affect progress and health to consider the macros of what you're eating. I lost the last 10lbs I wanted to get rid of through HIIT and macros. I got pregnant last year and am using the app again to help me get back to where I was last year. It's like having a personal trainer in your pocket. Because it's such a popular app, there is a great abundance of food items in their library bow too. When I first started using it I had to create my food items all the time and now most things are already stored in the app from myself and other users, including many popular restaurant items.

                      Title: Good for gaining weight too, if you need to!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the only app I have ever taken the time to review. I really find this app helpful as I have stomach and intestinal issues/disease and have always struggled with being very underweight. Recently my poor weight and health have made it very hard for me to stay pregnant. I have had recurring miscarriages over the past year and a half and my doctor advised that I try very hard to gain weight. I started using this app and have since gained over 20 pounds. This is the most I have ever weighed in my life at 125 pounds.  (I am 31 years old and 5' 7"... in the past I've never even made it onto the BMI chart before!)  I am feeling great and plan to continue with the app to keep on the weight.  It is very helpful for me to track my calories and make sure I am eating enough to maintain the weight and put on even more so I can be healthy.  I plan to keep using it while pregnant to make sure that I continue to keep my weight up and put on even more pounds for a sweet little baby!

                      Title: Easier to stay within budget
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Dieting is hard enough. This App really helps you stay within budget. I started counting calories using Lose It App, which I learned about on Dr Oz by one of his guests that said the App really helped her lose weight counting calories. I used it for months then started My Fitness Pal at same time. I noticed when I'd record weight loss, Lose It deducts your Budget as you lose. My FP does not. Both started me at 1,200 cal's/daily for my age, height, weight & goal. LI App has me down to 1,152, which is under what I googled needing per day. When I stay within LI Budget then the My FP App tells me I'm not eating enough cal's & my body thinks its starving. What I've read (online) is that not eating enough cal's/daily the body goes into starvation mode & begins feeding on muscle. So, I like this App best. Plus it gives so many brands & restaurants for cal search it makes it easier to stay within my 1,200 and not get discouraged with dieting. Thanks My Fitness Pal. I'm losing (16lbs so far) & not frustrated!

I'm a runner. Couldn't Lose those last 25 pounds to get lean enough to run Marathons. (i lost from 240 to 210 on my own by stopping sugar and junk food and reinventing myself as a runner over the last year and a half. So I  downloaded this app. Amazingly easy to follow. Very eye opening in terms of finding out why, even though I am now a health food nut, I couldn't lose those last 25 to get running lean. Who knew salad dressing was packed with calories? Or that 4 cups of skim milk has 400 calories? Or that a tablespoon of peanut butter has over a hundred? All that adds up quick. I started using this app four weeks ago and I've lost 5 pounds. (I've got it set for a pound a week) I'm already feeling the lighter on my feet running. I figured last week, "Hey Tap and Tracks paid app must be even better" so I got it too. It's not as good as this one. Tap and track doesn't have foods like "Zoi Greek Yogurt." My fitness Pal does. You guys are great offering this free. It's worth 20 bucks. Thanks alot.

However, once I started using the database search tool, most everything is available! I like the option to identify if you had a half or whole serving (or more!). This was also a terrific tool to help manage my pregnancy weight gain. It took a few tries to get the appropriate caloric number set so I could maintain weight (versus lose or gain to much).

                      Title: It's pretty good
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I think one of the main selling points of this product is that fitness is easier to stay on track if you are doing it with support. Thus the name "myfitnesspal". So the minimal information they require is needed to establish those links with friends and provide accurate calorie recommendations. We have a whole group at work that is linked together so we can motivate each other. It only exposes to your friends what you want it to. That being said, I haven't read the privacy policy which I'm sure is about as bad as everyone else. My only frustration is that it seems to not allow a calorie goal less than 1200. Also not sure that it will provide calorie recommendations for pregnancy and breast feeding like the gov tracker does (myplate or something like that) not that I'm pregnant and trying to eat less than 1200 calories cause that would not be safe at all. I mainly use the website and use the app just as a supporting feature versus expecting the app to do it all just as efficiently as a website.

Got tired of my pants fitting tight. Downloaded this app and started exercising. What I love is easy input w/ no journal. It knows almost all major food products so calorie tracking is not a chore (no journaling).I also love how it factors in exercise with calories and gives you a net daily value. Too close to your daily amount? Exercise and it deducts from your total. I entered in my beer intake and (holy smokes). I also started monitoring my milk consumption and holy smokes again. I have already started eating healthier snacks. Having smaller portions as well. I can't believe how many freaking calories I was actually consuming while eating so little. I am embarrassed to admit how many fewer calories I am now under my target and how many over I was. One suggestion I have for the update is to allow users to describe their activity level daily along with the general overall option. I would also recommend more graphs to follow daily exercise along with progress. A+

Love love love this app! I've used it off and on for the last year - I lost the rest of my pregnancy weight and then some using this and exercise last year! I don't utilize the step tracker really as I walk far more than it records, simply because I don't always carry phone around. I do wish it had an option to track macros for those doing IIFYM. I found a way to alter it via the MFP website but it doesn't translate to the app and I don't use the website ever because I don't find it as user friendly as the app. It keeps your macros as percentages rather than grams, so if you start with 120 protein for the day, then you exercise and your calories left go up, so does the percentage of protein you should eat. I docked a star because I wish they'd make all the recent foods available for all meals! In other words, if I put cottage cheese in for my breakfast, I should be able to pull it up for lunch or dinner as well, rather than have to search or scan the food again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I started using this in the Spring time, May 2014, and I love it! I started working out to lose the baby weight I had from my 3rd pregnancy and this app helped me program what I wanted to lose and how much to lose each week. After you program how much you want to lose or maintain, it will inform you how many calories you will want to eat around. You also get to put down how active you are and modify the amount of weight you want to lose each week. I also love how you can scan the food you eat, this allows you to see exactly what you're eating as well as knowing if that certain food is high or low in sat. fat; cholesterol; vitamin C; etc. I was able to lose 15 pounds within about 3-4 months with this app helping me while I exercise. But remember, it's all about your mind mentality to have this app plus exercising to help you lose weight, maintain weight, or gain muscle/weight.

I was looking for an app to track my calorie intake, since I wanted to lose about 10-15 pounds. This app did much more than I expected. I actually look forward to getting up early, tracking my daily weight, working out and planning my meals for the day. I've lost 11 pounds in 6 weeks, and I think I can lose the last 11 pounds to get to my pre-pregnancy weight of 137!  (I've only had this "baby fat" since I gave birth to my daughter 13 years ago...haha!!).  The app has tons of calorie and nutrition data for different foods.  It's really eye-opening to see what a true "serving size" is, and compare it to what you actually eat when not really paying attention. No wonder these extra pounds crept up on me over the years... I love clicking "complete" in this app at the end of each day, and seeing where my weight might be in 5 weeks.  It motivates me to stay away from the ice cream for dessert!!

The numbers don't lie.  If you record data accurately and honestly, measuring progress consistently over time, you will get genuine results with this app. The beauty of it is all in the numbers; you don't have to rely on your own intuitive sense of how you are doing on a given day because the figures are there in black and white for review.  And yes, that means getting to tuck into a milkshake or a Big Mac now and then when things start to feel drab.  I used the numbers every now and then to see how I could afford to indulge a bit when I was feeling tired of it all.  The app shows you all the options to combine eating less with moving more.

It helped me lose 15 pounds for my wedding and now I'm using it again to help lose my last 15 pounds after having our baby... The easy add barcode feature makes it simple and leaves no excuse not to enter in the foods. I am also able to add in my breakfast smoothie and make it a stored meal so I don't have to manually add in all of the ingredients each morning. Same thing with our standard weekly meals, just a quick click and the foods all there! I can also compete with my wife to see who is losing the most and sticking to the plan with the friends function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is wonderful and so worth it! Almost all the labels food you'll eat can be found in the app. It makes it easier to log certain brands. I'd say that they need to make it easier to create meals. They should make it so you can add an ingredient (an egg) and I auto populated the nutritional value of added food into that recipe. An example would be a mug cake with coconut flour, egg and milk. The app should allow you to add these ingredients and it auto populates the calories and carbs based on your portions. I'd also like to see more options for exercise. It could also give a summary of the benefits of the nutrition that a person has eaten over a course of time. For example, it can say you consumed 1000mg of potassium this week. You can increase by a certain amount. Here are some foods high in potassium.  BUT LOVEEE THE APP. It's extremely helpful. So easy to log. I've never used a better app.

I have been using this app for almost 2 months now and have lost 18 lbs total. The database is exceptionally complete, especially considering I primarily cook from scratch at home.....(could use some work on restaurant offerings, but since we rarely eat out, it isn't that big of a deal for me to review nutritional info on restaurant websites). I love the fact that I can add my personal recipes for calculation and the app will calculate calories for Individual servings....plus, it is saved in my database for later use. Not only am I using the app, but many of my friends use the app as well as my doctor and nurse practitioner. I cannot speak to the app integration with a fitness device as I do not have one yet. However, my future purchase of a fitness device partially depends on the integration ability with MyFitnessPal.

Love this app! First time I used it I just had my daughter and needed to lose some serious baby weight. Within months I was back to my normal size and everyone noticed! Best part about this app is it encourages fitness. Yea u can restrict ur diet and not eat as may calories as u need, but doing so will send ur body into starvation mode. So it's best to track what you eat, be conscious of your food intake, choose better snacks/meals and workout to burn calories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been using Spark People online for over a year and had good success but their app was not working well for me and it always wanted me to increase my calories as I increased my fitness which I think led me to a plateau. I decided to try this app because of the raves about the database of food. Sure enough in the week I have been using it I have not had to enter a food-and I eat some different stuff. I use goat's milk and not only was it listed my specific brand was listed. I also find it easier to enter recipes since I cook most meals at home that is key for me. I really love the feature that tells you how much weight you could lose in five weeks if every day were like that day. It motivates me and helped me finally busy through my two month plateau!!! Hooray!

                      Title: Fantastic, needs commitment though
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is perfect if you really really want to lose weight. You must enter every bit of food to get an accurate picture of your calorie intake so it does require commitment, especially when you eat foods that are non-processed and don't have a handy barcode! But like most things in life, the more effort you put in the better the outcome. It's a real eye opener... it's so easy to go over your calorie limit, way too easy and I find this app brings me back every time I use it. I got it first almost 6 years ago after the birth of my second child...and 25 lbs to lose..... I've used it intermittently since then when I need to and am back at it after no. 4 with 30 lbs to lose! It's a total reality check after eating what and when I wanted during pregnancy. It has certainly helped me reel it in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I really love this app. It has really opened my eyes to how many calories I am consuming (never knew cake and alcohol had so many calories!). Anyway, now I am making  better choices. I like knowing how much I can eat for dinner and still hit my target. I love the summary at the end of the day which tells you the total amount of carbs, protein, fat and nutrients that you consumed that day. My gym even recommends this app!  At first I thought it took to long to enter all of the food I ate, but now that I eat basically the same things it's super easy. I focus on just staying on target everyday and less on what my weight is doing and I find that the weight is just slowly coming off which is great because I am not hungry ever! I wish I had this app for losing weight after my first pregnancy!  LOVE THIS APP!

                      Title: Premium Version No Better
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The free version essentially offers the ability to track the data a user needs to succeed. My physician recommends to his patients, and I've used for several years to track my nutritional intake. The app currently DOES NOT OFFER the option to set or track micronutrients..folate, folic acid, vitamin D, amino acids... These nutrients are critical, especially to women who are pregnant and those with nutrition-related illness. The premium version, offered at cost, doesn't offer the option to set or track micronutrients, either. In fact, I determined that there is no cost/benefit value to the premium version. I canceled my Premium subscription within the first month. Despite this, I recommend this app and hope the developer adds an update to include micronutrients.

I hear people's first response to utilizing this app as, "I don't have time to sit and enter everything I eat." It's those same people that diet and really want to lose weight but always fail. Using this app really really works. Accountability in everything we do is always key and keeping track of what you put into your body is crucial to successful weight loss. I was one of those people but I gave my fitness pal a shot and I lost 50 pounds after having my first child. Post pregnancy weight is super hard to lose. I tried all kinds of diets....and using myfitnesspal to count calories and receive encouragement from my friends was the missing piece in my weight loss transformation.  Try it out! It really works!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app has been very helpful for me personally in reaching my nutrition goals. I am surprised to read about bugs because I haven't encountered any issues with the functioning of the app. One star was lost because I wish the app would keep track of all scanned or otherwise selected foods. Currently, you can only recall recent items in the previously used category (breakfast, lunch , dinner, etc.) If I have entered almond milk in breakfast one day, the next day I may want to enter it for lunch, but I have to re-scan the barcode on the carton or re enter it, rather than it appearing in recent foods. It will, however show up as a recent food but only in the breakfast section because that's where it previously was entered. Other than that I am pleased with the app and I use it every day.

                      Title: The perfect weight companion to lose, gain or maintain!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Whether you are trying to lose, maintain or target a healthy pregnancy weight gain this app is for you. Takes the guess work out of everything and will guide you to smarter eating choices. You'll never starve making smart choices and if you splurge here and there you can see where to curb later on. Calorie allowances for workouts and recording servings as small as 1/8 of a serving are just a couple of the great features. When you can see so clearly how your calories add up that 1/2 cup of junky empty calorie food that seemed like a reasonable snack suddenly loses all appeal when you can fill up on cucumbers and vinaigrette for half the calories. Awesome app! Lost 2 lbs in the first week! Woohoo!

My hubby told me about the app, several people at his work were already using it and seeing big results...40-50 lb results!! So we got it and started our diets and eating healthier. That was 75 days ago and I am down 21 with another ten to go. Just got back in my skinny jeans today and couldn't feel better. My husband has already reached his goal weight so he is in the maintenance stage.

You can simply enter a restaurant or a random food item and anything you are looking for, you will find. I have yet to stump it!  I also got my husband and sister to download this app and become "fitness plan friends"; similar to Facebook. We can encourage each other and see each others progress. I love this app. I just had a baby and unfortunately I gained a little too much weight during my pregnancy. This app will be (and already has been) VERY helpful in getting my body back in shape.

Sometimes I'll look something up just to see the calorie and nutrient content. The exercise feature is great as well.

I eventually stopped using it without the time or energy to focus on pregnancy & a 2 year old. After baby of course like every other woman is wanting to lose baby weight. I wanted to use this app but it doesn't have a choice for breast feeding I did read on sites eat about such & such calories but it would really be great if this app had that included. Breastfeeding burns at least 500 calories a day - I feel It should be an option.

I easily lost the weight and found helpful information about my protein and sodium intake. This is an indispensible training tool. I recommend it to everyone I know. As a nurse I think it has great health benefits. I was very pleased with the large assortment of exercises and the scan option for food! The only improvement tht would help athletes, but I dont know if its possible) is if it could adjust sodium and potassium level to account those lost by exercise? I also love the daily summary and projected weight- that is a real motivator.

The only things that would make this app better would be having the option of truly recording meal times.  I am very active and nursing and have to consume a LOT of calories.  If nothing else, more additional meal slots... (like 8 per day rather than 6) would be helpful.  If they just allowed you, instead of selecting "breakfast," to select an hour of the day as your meal it would be helpful.

It was then recommended to me again by a doctor that I work with. I know now why they recommend it. Very, very easy to use. Most of what I scan in already in the database. Search engine is not picky at all which makes typing something in easy. I was on a low carb diet before getting this app and it should be of value no matter what diet your on. Helps me keep track of carbs, sodium, and vitamins. I take two different brands of vitamins and they are both scannable. I do hope they add more categories to track vitamins.

Fidelity is important. I do feel though that having some idea of what is healthy and what's not healthy to eat can be helpful when using my fitness pal. Exercise, drinking enough water, and avoiding empty calories are all good rules of thumb and will help you be successful on my fitness pal. I'm finding that I am rarely hungry and find myself binging less. I'm also less likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater when I do make mistakes.I would recommend my fitness pal for anyone.

With myfitnesspal, I am able to make sure I'm getting the proper nutrients for my body and for my family. If I could make one suggestion, it would be to tailor the site for pregnant women as well as those trying to lose/gain weight. Other than that, I am very impressed and thankful I found this app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Most features of this app are great. I like the ability to scan foods directly from the label and the food database is getting larger everyday. I also like how it syncs with Map my Run. A couple improvements would be to differentiate between naturally occurring sugars (think fruit and dairy) and added sugars. Sometimes it will tell me I've exceeded my sugar goal when all I've had are milk sugars and fruit which are processed differently in the body than added sugars so I don't track them. The other thing that would be great are adding sand-walking and hill-walking to the list of exercises. Both of these burn way more calories than walking on flat or stable surfaces but I can't get it to accurately reflect in my diary.

This app still leaves all the real work in your hands. It's good for keeping track of the math for you, but it's still up to you to make smart choices in how to "spend" your calories. It also falls short in the exercises dept. I had to dig around a lot of different websites to figure out how many calories I was burning doing something really basic like Power Yoga. It also doesn't account for nursing moms. Figuring out how many calories I'm burning while nursing is yet another thing I have to keep track of on my own.

I wish it would give you the option to select certain profiles like, pregnant, nursing etc so that itd highlight how you're doing on key ingredients like protein etc. it doesn't allow you to create certain goals specific to nutritional ingredients, just weight.

I love this app!  I have battled the same "last 10 lbs" from my last baby for 7 years now. This app has really helped me track all those "mindless" calories that I would consume without thinking about it-- the 500 calories in the Chilis chips and salsa, the extra salad dressing, the "just 1" cookie, etc. I have always worked out and eaten fairly healthy, yet could never quite stick to a diet. This has helped me allocate my calories during the day when I know I will be eating out for dinner or having dessert with friends. I just make sure I save enough room for that in my allocation. In 7 days I have lost 4 lbs without hardly even trying!

I can toss out my old calorie reference books!  This little gem has it all.  It remembers your most frequently eaten foods so it's on your selection list as you make entries, and portion sizes are easily adjusted to your intake.  The scanner is genius; if you can't find something, scanning it in does the work for you, even with obscure generic brand foods, it finds a comparable match that's spot on.  The best feature is, it will calculate the calories in any recipe you have!  I cook a lot, and had to guess before, but this baby figures it out for you!  If you're any kind of foodie, or are looking to maintain your health GET this app!  You've got nothing to lose but weight!

                      Title: Great at keeping me on track!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

After eating with reckless abandon for the first 29 years of my life, following the birth of my second child (now 14 months old) I haven't been able to shed the last of the baby weight. My husband convinced me to use this app and after just 1 week I'm so glad to finally be seeing results! Only one complaint: if there is a food I eat for dinner then try to log the same food another day for lunch, it doesn't easily pop up when I search. I was also surprised that I put in a weekly weight loss goal, yet after 7 days there was no reminder or prompt to enter a weight and track my progress.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I first used this app two years ago to lose baby weight. It was good back then, but I was constantly wishing it could do more. My wish came true, and this app now does EVERYTHING. I'm so impressed. Technology is so cool. If developers out there are reading this, it'd be great to see tailored recipe suggestions based on the type of diet the user is doing (for example, user only sees paleo recipes). Also, it'd be great if this app had a pregnancy option with evolving calorie targets that match the recommended caloric intake throughout the 9 months. Great work on this app, it's probably one of the most impressive free apps I've ever seen.

I love this app. I started my quest to lose weight (a.k.a baby weight!) with weight watchers but then realized I wanted to understand how/what/when to eat to lose weight and this app is the bomb!!! I set it to lose 2 lbs a week and I literally have done just that!! I've only been using it for almost three weeks but I couldn't have lost the weight without it. So easy to use, so many foods and exercises already in the system and ready to track; I love it!! Between this and MapmyRun, I should be on the cover of the next sports illustrated swimsuit edition in no time!!! (Ok, that's really pushing it! But I should be back in my pre-baby clothes before long ;)

All I know is my college roommate gave me some great weight loss tips and told me to use myfitnesspal. She's analyzing my graphs and everything! Haha! After training for my first 5k for 10 weeks & doing great at my 1st race- I didn't see a single ounce of weight come off. And I was running 12+ miles a week! Started with myfitnesspal last Friday and I have lost 5.4 lbs this week! THANK YOU for such a resourceful app that is even better than Weight Watcher's! I'm down 5.4- Here's to losing the other 40 lbs I'd love to lose! :)

This app is awesome. I have lost 10 pounds in the first 3 weeks of upswing this app. The app is not going to make you lose weight, it makes you more aware of what your eating. I like most Americans love the taste of fast food and wouldn't think anything about ordering a whole meal with a desert at a fast food place, maybe a milk shake some frys and a hamburger? Well that's probably 2500 plus calories right there! Your done for the day! Lol. Now I find myself looking at what's the best low caloric, low sodium meal to order. Not that I have cut out everything that's bad for me, it's just in moderation because I'm mucho re cautious because of myfitnesspal! Thank you!

I gave birth to twins two months ago and I love that I can add breastfeeding to my daily diary, which accounts for 1k calories burned (500 if you're nursing 1 baby).  I tried to use while pregnant but I didn't notice a daily activity to account for the extra calories needed during pregnant but I do see now there are plenty of options if you type pregnancy in the search area.  Has every food imaginable in the database, generic, specific stores, restaurants, even my target prenatal vitamin.

I love that you can import a recipe from the internet just by entering the URL and it does all the work for you!  The nutritional info is so accurate...even more so than the Weight Watchers app!  I've never scanned a barcode that the app was unable to find!  Looking forward to getting the last half of my weight off quickly!!

It is so obvious now that I can see where my calories are coming from, no wonder I couldn't lose weight before, despite my routine workout schedule.  This is an easy app to use and a real eye opener.  I feel motivated using this app and for the first time in my life I feel in control of what is going in my mouth.  Highly recommend this app!!  I lost 3 lbs in the first 5 days, if you follow the calorie recommendation without cheating it will work.

Btw I had one is with trying to figure calories lost for breast feeding and emailed the creator.  I received a prompt helpful response!  I would reccomend this app to anyone who wants to make healthy changes without dieting.

I decided to give it a try and started listing my food consumption (a loooot of foods available on the list including my native foods, so thrilled!!!). Combined with my exercises, I started losing weight, total of 10 pounds in 3-4 months. Now I am in my pre-pregnant weight again!!! Thank you!!!

The customer service is amazing too! I can't say enough positive things about it! I'm a firm believer in MyFitnessPal. I use it with RunKeeper to track my calories burned accurately with every workout. What else can I say? I LOVE IT! Get this APP and "USE IT!"

I like the app. It makes me accountable.  It's nice to have the news feed so you can get support from others. However, the forum is not available on the app.  If you primarily use the app, it's hard To make friends if you don't already know people using it. Also, the forums that are available online are very basic. There should be more specific forums for women such as pregnancy, postpartum moms, breast feeding moms, age group specific forums, etc.  As far as the diary there is a sufficient database for foods.  The exercise database is lacking.  The Tap &Track app has much more specific exercises and activities listed. I actually go back and forth between the two due to that.

Although it doesn't, there is a way when adding or searching for foods to add "exclusively breastfeeding" which then subtracts 500 calories or however many you want it too.

The only downside is you can't restart your weight without deleting all the data. I had downloaded it years ago before my 3 pregnancies and weight gain, so when I started the progress part said I had gained weight the first week instead of having lost it. I had to delete the starting point, but to do that I had to cancel the account and then reset it up.

It would be nice to be able to keep up with vitamin D and other vitamins that are added to the food supply due to deficiency.  For example, many people are vitamin D insufficient or deficient.  I am one of them.

I'm doing this for weight gain, and nutriets are the most important thing; this app is easy to use and I highly recommend it. Even if you only use it for weekend you will learn a lot about yourself.

I don't know if this is an option in the Pro version. Thanks for a wonderful app! I hope to return in several months to comment on how this app helped me reach my goal weight!

My goal is six pack abs at age 47. MyFitnessPal has helped me appreciate some potholes in my diet (eg sugar content of lowfat milk, and portion size of nuts and peanut butter). I'm more accountable to myself using the app. I love that so many foods, meals and restaurants are already loaded. I've tried other methods and apps to log nutrition and they weren't easy/fast enough. I've lost 50lbs over 28 months and have the last 5-10 before I reach 10% body fat and the abs pop (for the first time in my life).  This app is one of my tools. Also SNAP Kitchen. It's truly 80% diet after all.

It is so easy, and as a vegetarian, I eat some lesser-known foods. But this app has such a huge database, I've yet to have to enter any nutritional info manually. I've searched for specific pregnancy apps that do roughly the same thing and none have come close to this app's user-friendliness. 5 stars, for sure!

Love this app. Data is accurate, huge database of food items, and the feedback on nutritional content of your daily intake is fantastic. Great interface, easy to use, and the "friends" aspect helps with motivation.  Has really helped me to be aware of what I am eating and to lose weight.  Working for many of my colleagues too. I actually learned about this app from a colleague who lost a lot of weight. Asked him how he did it, and he said it was this app. Love it.  Helped to keep me on track during pregnancy, with regard to quality and quantity of intake, weight gain, and blood sugars.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is the missing piece for me in my quest to lose my baby fat! After having three children and struggling for years with this app I finally understand what I've been doing wrong. You don't realize how quickly and easily calories add up. This app puts my diet and exercise habits into perspective and gives me a realistic view of my weight loss, exercise and diet. I have yet to come across a food that I can't find, even Kirkland brands from Costco are listed! Totally worth it! Best and most useful app I've ever downloaded!!!

I use it for every single meal, sync it to all my other apps, and have my Fitbit linked for steps. It makes me feel in control of my eating habits, keeps me in check, and is incredibly easy to use. My ONLY wish, would be that they would add a few more options the help calculate your daily intake. For example.. I know it's not an issue that many people have, but I'm a nursing mom so 1200 calories is way too low for me, even if that's what my current weight says I should take in. It would just be nice to have that option so I didn't see that I'm "over my calories" every day!

MyFitnessPal makes it very easy to count calories and view you macro and micro intake. All you have to do is look up the product or scan in the barcode. If you have a recipe, you can insert the recipe into MyFitnessPal and let it tell you how many cals or carb, fat, and protein intake it contains. Most people start losing pounds in the first week! Love this app and will continue to use it even after I've shed my baby weight. It even includes a "maintain weight" option. There are so many ways to use this app, it should help with everyone's goals.

                      Title: Might I suggest a few additions?

I have been using this app for about a week now and have absolutely loved it. A few recommendations that would make this app the absolute best is if one could make what they ate for lunch or breakfast and add it to dinner or vice versa. The other big thing would be to allow users to save favorite foods or ingredients. Say I use milk in a bunch of different meals or recipes (mainly for use with recipes) instead of having to search or scan each time I want to add it pulling from a list of faves would be ideal. All-in-all it is a great app!

As the mother of 3, a full time employee and a nursing student, I never thought I could add one more thing or focus on my health. Well MFP has helped me to do so and I'm feeling better than I have I years! I'm not overweight to begin with but was not in shape and didn't realize how many empty calories I consumed until I logged it everyday. I love how you can check your "daily intakes" to see what you need more or less of. Having friends on MFP for support, encouragement and advice has been great.

I just had a baby & usually use WW Online but didn't want to spend $50 to join. This is a great FREE alternative & has a lot of nice features, plus the database of foods is extensive. It's nice to think of food in terms o actual calories & nutritional elements; the real world doesn't operate on a "points" system. I really enjoyed WW Online before but this is better & free. Be careful to adjust the calories if necessary, the recommendation the app gave me was way too low.. I added about 500 calories & am losing weight at a much more healthy pace.

You can also change the amount of calories you need manually which I had to do because I'm breastfeeding.  I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to watch their weight or log their calories.

I have thus far have a healthy pregnancy even with the gestational diabetes. I will continue to use my fitness pal after my pregnancy for continued weight loss.

Not only has it inspired me to eat a healthier, lower cal, balanced diet, but my alcohol intake has greatly reduced! I hate entering those empty calories so much, that I have cut way back on drinking all together.

I'm not looking to be a skinny Minnie, but with what I've lost I feel great and I owe it to this app.  Love the scan tool, and that I can add my own recipes!  Just wish there was a bigger data base for the cardio section. I also use Pacer with it, love that they sync up!

My second is due in September and I fully intend to use this app to lose the weight again! It's easy to use and has every single food you can think of in its database. It also gives you extra calories for working out. Love it!

I knew I had to eat a certain amount of calories a day, but it all seemed like guess work and I was feeling a bit overwhelmed. This app takes the mystery out of the equation. It helps track your calories and exercise, and is an amazing tool in teaching portion control. It also allows you to connect with others and stay motivated. I highly recommend this app! I am sharing it with my whole family.

So far in one month of counting calories and working out I've lost 10lbs. It's nice knowing how many calories I actually consume and seeing the results.

This is a real powerhouse of a little app and will do just about anything the average tracker could want. The only improvement in my point of view would be a way to track more nutrients--as a pregnant woman I want to watch some of the more unusual nutrients, like folate, choline, et cetera. It would also be convenient if you could turn off brand foods somehow; it gets a little old scrolling through pages of fast foods and prepared foods just to find something simple like a potato! But it's a great start and the price can hardly be beaten. ;)

Using this app has helped me lose some baby weight by having a great database and easily taking into account exercise.  I agree that it's hard to tailor it to personal goals in terms if appropriate calories to consume, especially when breastfeeding.  It would be great if this app considered extra calories needed for bfeeding moms, so I just add 300 cals needed each day.  Also, some of the database entries are missing nutritional info, which is info I rely on, so sometimes I have to sort through various entries to find a completed entry.

It seemed so impossible a task and yet they broke it down for me into baby steps and little by little, the weight came off.  It is now more a way of life than a tool for weight loss for me.  I owe them a lot.

I really love this app, I really think this truly helps you with counting calories and keeping track of what you eat throughout your day. I really love also the aspect of how it counts your steps and you can add anything you want. The only thing I would say that I wish they would do, is to add some sort of pregnancy feature. I would love to be able to still count calories but be healthy during the pregnancy without the app thinking I'm just gaining unnecessary weight haha!  Over all I love this app!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is so much better than WW and it's free!! The database is filled with foods and exercises to select without having to customize. I would have given it a 5 star but I would like for the app to have an edit button for recipes that I add. I forgot to add an ingredient to a recipe and I can't edit or delete. I would also like for the app to have a breast feeding option for new moms and have app adjust the calories for that. I still love the app and wish I would have started this from the git go after my son was born.

I love it! The only thing I wished was that there were more options for lifestyles,etc that would change your calorie intake. For example if you're breastfeeding... But it has enough features to make up for that. You can input whether you want to lose weight, stay the same, or gain, and at what rate, and 4 levels of how active you are. Some foods are incomplete with nutrition data, but there's enough to chose from that it first matter. Restaurants and specialty foods are in there as well.

This app has made me very conscious of what I'm eating and helps me to choose healthier options. I can search for the food I eat and it is normally in there. Anything from fresh veggies and fruit to a restaurant in town, it's on there. If its not, you can search the items separately and store it in ur meals section so you never have to look it up again. I just wish more exercises were listed in the cardiovascular section. Some like sex, walking with a baby heavier than 15-lbs, jumping jacks, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I've used my fitness pal for a couple of years now. I appreciate that it keeps me honest but the app has a few bugs. It doesn't calculate calorie burn from steps correctly and I also feel like when you add your own recipes it doesn't calculate the calories per serving correctly. For instance when I am on the main screen keying in the recipe it says one thing and then once I save the recipe the calorie count changes??? But overall it does what I need, maintain weight normally and helped control pregnancy weight gain as well.

No other diets or any commercial products will ever deliver you the same results as careful watching of what you eat. 5 more pounds and I will be almost at my pre-pregnancy weight :)) But if I lose 10 pounds I will be almost like a model :)) Greatly-greatly recommend to everyone!

MFP is a fantastic app for tracking your food and exercise and keeping yourself accountable to lose or maintain weight. The ease of use and food data base simply can't be beat.

The ability to take photos is another great way to see progress. Yes, there are ads, BUT you get a lot for a FREE app!

In short, try it out.  I think you'll like it, too.

I have had gestational diabetes during my last 2 pregnancies and this app is better than any of the others I've tried. Particularly helpful are the charts and graphs that allow me to keep track of how I'm doing on my daily goals. Also, it's the flexibility of the program to input my own goals as advised by my nutritionist. If I cannot find a food item I'm looking for (which is rare) I can usually find a close substitute and that's terrific.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app! I have been using it for a week and a half and have lost 5 lbs. it's easy to use and has really opened my eyes to how many calories I was actually eating! I use to hate trying to count calories but this makes it so easy to see if your under or over your nutritional goals! It takes the guessing game out of it. It has really helped me stick to dieting this time! The baby weight is finally coming off!

In weight loss and healthy living motivation is this app. Knowledge is power and this allows me to know the calories and nutrition in everything from a homemade muffin to a glass of wine. I have several friends who have lost baby weight and pre-wedding weight by setting goals and recording progress with this app. I find it very motivating to save my results at the end of the day and see where I wod be in 5 weeks if I stick with my plan.

This app has been an amazing tool on my journey to my pre-babies body! It's super easy! It not only helps me track my calories and exercise but allows me to see if I'm meeting all my nutritional goals as well which is important because I am still breast feeding! The only thing I wish they would add was the option to take in account for the extra calories and nutrients breast feeding mothers need so I didn't have to calculate that my self.

I have tried so many different ways to lose the baby weight after my sons were born, and just felt discouraged and out of control. This app makes staying aware of what you are eating and how you're exercising a total breeze. I love that you can put your own recipes in and it does all the math for you. And that I can earn brownies through exercise. This just works. I've lost 23 lbs and I'm still motivated and going strong!

I mainly use this to track my calories and weight. A few years ago it helped me lose 40 pounds.  Which I kept off until I got pregnant.  After giving birth in May I was up the 40 again. So I'm back using it. So far I'm down 15 pounds. 25 more to go!! Couldn't have done it without this app.  Its amazing to see how many calories you consume in a day.  It helps me learn to portion control and be aware of what I'm putting into my body.

This is great for holding myself accountable. I can track what I'm eating, drinking, and doing. It communicates with the iHealth app so calories burned because of something else all communicates over. I've dropped 30+lbs in  about two months using this tool. 35 since I went back to work and 55lbs since I had my baby 5.5months ago! I'm looking into the watches that give you free premium for a year to get me through the next 30lbs.

I don't do the whole "eat less" so I can be skinny from nursing. My body is holding on to fat and to maintain my milk supply I need to eat. My son sleeps and is well fed. All that to say MyFitnessPal has allowed me to track my intake and then I supplement a few 100 extra to keep my milk supply up! Thank you!!!

Pregnant women aren't necessarily wanting to diet when they try to use this program, they are trying to stay with in their recommended weight gain goals set up by their obstetrician.  I wish you could input pregnancy status, pre-pregnancy weight, how far along you are, and the obstetrician's weight gain goal for you. And then let MFP figure out the daily calories for you, adjusting itself as the weeks go by.

You can also add in breast feeding (for nursing moms) to account for the extra calories you but each day. Excellent app!

This app is great.

It is also very flexible to set up weight gain or weight loss which is great for me since I'm pregnant and need to be gaining weight on a consistent basis and just don't want to gain more then necessary.

It helps you set a goal and keep track of food, weight and exercise. If you exercise, your calorie allotment goes up! That's motivating! You can choose to share your journey with friends. As a nurse I am giving this amazingly free app high praise.

I'm still going to use it, but if functionality that was standard before starts becoming only available with premium I'm gone.

I love this App. It works!!  I love that it includes menu items from s lot of my favorite restaurants and allows me to record a fraction of a portion to get closer to the actual calorie intake. The graph of progress is encouraging / I could go on and on. If I were going to make it better I would label items by setting easier to find - I'd say Cheerios with 1/2 cup skim milk instead of With 1/2 Cup Skim Milk - Cheerios. Thanks for creating this awesome and very helpful App!!

Converting from ww points to calories during pregnancy. This app has allowed me to keep track with almost every food possible and restaurant options. It gives you helpful tips of the nutrients on your food and warns you if you've had too much of it. It also gives you a chart with the recommended percentage of your nutritional guide to stay on track based on your goals. I love it!!! And it's free

I really like how things on here are now "verified" hence more trust worthy. I also think it's awesome you can create your own recipe. My only downfall in the app is that there's no calorie credit for strength training and it would be nice if there was something on there for breast feeding mothers since I currently am one. I ended up adding my own "cardio exercise" for it but it would be nice if the company would account for this. Overall, amazing app I have been using for years now!

I don't use the website, so I also wish there was a little more editing functionality in the app (e.g copying a meal to a date, but under a different meal category). But those are minor things and I'm very happy with it.

If I made a latte at home I enter in 1 1/2 cups light vanilla soy milk and it knows the nutrition - no guessing for me!

Now I use it to keep track of my calories and it's so awesome for that too!

It's definitely more motivation to stay on track.

The daily goal under nutrients is excellent to limit added sugars, but unfortunately it counts natural sugars as well, which forces me to do math - yuck!

So if you could add two more options in the profile - breastfeeding exclusively, and breastfeeding and feeding solid foods and then add the correct amount of calories to that, it would be wonderful. Other than that, a really great app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Easy to use, large food database. I actually found raw whole milk already in the database today. I've been using it for a week and haven't had to manually add any food I've eaten. Love it!! Nothing easier than search and click to add a food to your list. Exercise tracking is just as easy. I also love the graphs and the way it shows me my daily and weekly totals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a great app. I love how it not only tracks the calorie intake, but it tracks my exercise and extra caloric intake because of the workout I do. The only change I would ask for is that I'm an ER Nurse and I work the overnight shift. My day doesn't start til 4pm and I eat dinner at 3am. The program stops my calorie intake at midnight. A great update would be to pick the time I wanted to start my day. Other than that, I love it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm pregnant and following a strict nutrition and exercise regimen. This app allows me to monitor how I am doing and make the necessary adjustments through my day and week. It was recommended to me by a friend who is using it to train for a marathon, and this app also helps for someone like me who has to gain weight each week. And I would figure most people use it for trying to lose weight. So it's Very versatile.

This app is awesome!! It helps to really see how many calories you intake on a daily basis and gives you motivation also! Only complaint is that it doesn't show calories burned doing strength training. I have lost inches and have toned a lot in a only a couple of weeks! I love that it shows you a breakdown of nutrition and not just how many calories you've had. Ps. My trainer told me THE BEST THING TO DRINK AFTER WORKOUTS is LOWFAT! Chocolate Milk! ;-) ;-)

So, before I started using this app I was eating really horribly as any sixteen year old does, but the lady I baby sit for recommended this app to me when I alex her about what she was using. I downloaded, and didn't use it for a while but recently I have gotten obsessed with tracking my calories on here. It's so amazing(: I've lost about 3 pounds an I've only been constantly using it for about a week.

I really like the fact that it links with my fit-bit surge. I can track food, exercise and cardiac performance in one spot. Analysis of vitamin and mineral intake along with weight gain (I'm supposed to put on healthy weight) is great! The doctors are sceptic at first but always check it out thoroughly at my check ups. I had a heart attack (mild) and the nurses in cardiac rehab strongly recommended a fit bit. So here I am!

Now, after the birth of my almost 9lb son, it's time to get back at it and shed the 60lbs of baby weight gain! I've two lbs in  just under a week, and in my way to a healthier, leaner, better me. Cheers and kudos to all the effort put in this app. It's truly one of my favorites.

This is the only app I use for health tracking, and with good reason. It's easy to use, easy to follow, and actually helpful. I have recommended it to multiple friends, and even have my husband using it! I just wish there could be a way to change daily recommended caloric intake and not have it take retroactive effect--this would be especially helpful for people who experience life changes (surgery, pregnancy, etc).

Milk for example has Vitamin D, but I don't see this as one of the nutrition fields.

That's hard to know exactly how many calories I need in order to do that so please add the option to the app! Other than that, I can't complain.
