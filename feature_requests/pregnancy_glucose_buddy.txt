--------------------------------------------------------------------

Great app very helpful at consistently tracking in one place, glucose levels, nutrition and med adherence. Please add section/differentiated goals and nutritional information for gestational diabetes. The goals and recommendations are importantly different due to needing to get enough calories and nutrition for baby.

Great way to go from best to worst. Easy track records emailed to my physician for free now need to be printed out and are no longer free. Let me welcome your organization to the new 21st century economic model that you have embraced by feeding off people with health issues. The new American way. You should be ashamed. Iâ€™m gone.

Have found it extremely useful to keep track of my BG since being diagnosed with gestational diabetes. The note part is great because I am controlling it with diet so I can note what I ate that gave the reading and understand better how to choose the next meal!

                      Title: Perfect for managing Gestational Diabetes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a great app! I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes and had to learn how to live with testing and tracking very quickly. Glucose Buddy was easy to learn and use. I had to report my levels to my doctor weekly and it was very easy with the reports I could generate with Glucose Buddy. It would have been much harder for me to control my gestational diabetes without this app, I would have never been able to keep so organized. I gave birth to a healthy, 7lb6oz boy and I am certain that has everything to do with keeping on top of my diabetes because of Glucose Buddy.  So thank you so much!

                      Title: AWESOME!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is why I have an iPhone. I love this app and I've only been using it for the past three months. One drawback, when you email numbers to the doc, it sends them ALL. It would be awesome to send a range (1 week, month, etc). My doc informed me she printed 25 pages of my blood sugar numbers and asked if I would do the slightly annoying task of deleting some of the old numbers. Wouldn't be too much of a problem, but I'm emailing twice a week as I'm getting into the last couple of weeks of my pregnancy. All together this is great and has saved me time and money already!!! Thanks!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Just diagnosed with gestational diabetes and have to test 4x per day. My doctor gave me a sheet to write everything down on but found this app to be easier for me during the day while at work and away from home. I just write everything down on my doctors sheet at the end of the day. I would like to be able to set some parameters on the graph. I'm also having trouble loading my meter brand/info - app always shuts down when I try. Otherwise a great app for keeping basic info on my readings - very happy with it and definitely recommend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I developed gestational diabetes and this app has been fantastic for keeping a log of my daily readings. Plus I can email the log to my doctors. I use it along with Daily Carb - that app has been good for looking up carb values of food. It'd be great if a feature like that could be incorporated into this app.  And it'd be even better if I could plug in an amount of carbs (say 15g) and a food (say quinoa) and have it tell me how much I could eat.

I've never had a single problem using it to track and record my sugar levels. My sister is a nurse and loves that it downloads and emails accurately and correctly in an easy to read format for doctors.

I didn't need anything complicated as I got gestational diabetes and just needed to track my levels.  I love how with a few taps I'm able to log my level select time of day and which reading I was making, but also make notes as to what I ate to see if one food made a difference over others.    Love the graphing and email features as well! Perfect!

I paid for another diabetes app and ended up deleting it because this one has everything I needed and did it better. Keep up the great work!!

On line sync lets you email to your dr. Office. This is a great app to have. I truly recommend it if you serious about monitoring and keeping up with you health.

I love being able to quickly enter my blood sugar level, when I checked, what part of the day it was (post-prandial, out of bed, etc), and the free space to make a little note to myself about what I ate or extenuating circumstances. Thank you!

I use this app daily. There have been lots of improvements and bug fixed since I started and it just keeps getting better. It has helped me track my blood sugar levels and manage my diabetes since diagnosis. The only gripe I have is that the charts it emails can be difficult to read for the doctors and nurses who need the info. Overall, great app.

Much quicker even if I have to redo my account info.

I used this app all through my gestational diabetes. The only thing I didn't like was that you had to erase every entry individually. I ended up erasing the app and then re-downloading it every two weeks.
