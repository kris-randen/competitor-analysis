                      Title: Easy to use, wish focus was on health
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is very easy to use to log the food you eat - what I mainly use it for, to stay balanced. It’s far more efficient than in 2010, when I first started using it. I spend maybe 5 minutes a day total logging my food intake. I like that it includes nutrition breakdowns so I can pinpoint when I’m lacking iron, or calcium, or etc in my overall diet.

                      Title: Dietary Restriction Alerts & Polar Compatibility
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In my own, personal opinion, the features that would earn fifth star would be to expand compatibility toward Polar brand products and applications, and to allow users to enter in specific ingredient, calorie, macro/micronutrient restrictions to be alerted to in meals & recipes.  It would be great to know if something I ate (or am logging because I'm about to eat) will conflict with a low FODMAP diet, or has more of a specific nutrient than I want at the time.  I recall a previous version that would offer food tips ("this food is high in sodium", "this food is a great source of vitamin c", etc.)

                      Title: Life changing if taken seriously
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I started using this app right at the apex of my weight gain during college. I didn’t participate in high school athletics and had virtually zero knowledge of anything nutritionally beyond, “ There’s a place that shoots out 5 dollar burgers.”. I think it’s most important to look at the composition of macronutrients in a few days worth of your particular diet, not necessarily using this as a “calorie counter”. It’s very hard to ignore some of the numbers that will pop out at you if you are diligent and truthful with yourself. It helps to motivate you in a different direction. Even though everything has nutritional information labeled as a requirement, it’s easy ignore until you start to realize that if Item A has 32g of fat and %4000 percent of my daily sodium intake... and that’s my daily between breakfast and lunch...  It could totally swing a large portion of my diet by just omitting that one item.

                      Title: Very helpful
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently started using MyFitnessPal and it is very helpful especially with tracking food and exercise. There are a couple of things that could be improved and those being on the home page I wished it showed all of your stats-calories eaten and remaining, carbs, fat, protein, sugar, fiber etc. I would also like to be able to set my calorie intake for the day and not have it adjust due to exercise. Maybe there is a way to do that and I just haven’t found it yet. Finally being able to enter the type of diet you eat would be great and then if you are low or high on calories, protein etc it would make suggestions on specific foods to eat to make up for any high or low.  It does tell you if you have surpassed the “limit” but having suggestions would be amazing. I am also able to link it to my Garmin to record steps etc. One last thing I would like to see is an area to record vitamins/medications you are taking and figure those into the daily allowance and a place to record blood pressure, pulse, sleep patterns and other personal health info. Overall I am very pleased. It’s played a big part in losing my first 8 pounds!

                      Title: Very useful, easy, pleasant interface
--------------------------------------------------------------------

First, love the new update so I can hit "Nutrition" at the top of the screen rather than scrolling to the bottom, since that's what I want to see most. I've been using this app for many years; it's the best to fit my need to casually track what I eat just to be more aware of how much protein, sugar, iron, etc. I'm getting in general. It's really easy to use, the food database has a huge variety of options, and the fact that you can add your own nutritional information from personal recipes is handy. I've never gone for the upgrade because it already fits what I need perfectly but I definitely see how someone might like the perks of Premium, like knowing patterns of what times of day you eat certain things and breaking down your food into categories of protein, sugar, etc. It would be useful if I cared about being more specific and intentional but for my need to just casually be aware of how my nutrition is, the free version is super.

                      Title: Changed My Life
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Since using the app, I have dropped nearly 60lbs. The app is amazing. The app is well designed, has a massive database, and most importantly has a barcode scanner which makes tracking calories fast. There are countless times where I have refused food because I found out that it was too many calories. Furthermore, the app also tracks your steps, individual micro-nutrition stats, and calories over time. The trends are beautifully depicted in bar graphs. You have to do the work to count it all though.

                      Title: Great way to log / track your food intake
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very convenient app when it comes to logging you food for the day, the UPC reader is especially convenient for quickly and accurately logging any type of health prepackaged foods when you're on the go. I recently purchased the Microsoft band which I thought would interact with this app. Unfortunately it isn't quite there yet, it does log my steps from my phone but unfortunately I don't always have my phone on me so the band it likely much more accurate... Although you can add your physical exercise manually in the app so it's more of a convenience issue that anything...

                      Title: Does not CAUSE eating disorders
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was bulimic for 5 years (2 years clean) and I can say with absolute certainty that this app does not CAUSE eating disorders. If you believe that, you are highly inaccurate in your understanding of an extremely complex mental disease which is attributed to many many causes both mental, physical, and environmental (your surroundings and quite possibly upbringing). Get the proper care from licensed medical professionals and put in the work to fix your issues. It's not easy, not at all, but it isn't impossible. Quit unfairly pawning off your lack of understanding of a dangerous disease onto a single app. Reach out to resources and your support system, and take SOME accountability for your mental state. I'd never be clean or have felt comfortable gaining the weight I have through this app if I didn't accept that I had a problem which had many deeper causes. Not of those being an app that actually helps numerous people.

Only giving this app 2 stars because it’s a great, accurate tool for tracking my calories and macros.

So a plus on that.

                      Title: Love this App!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app has been so helpful with keeping me motivated to loose weight. I love how much food is already in the database and how easy it is to scan things. It is very user friendly. I give it 4 stars because I wish it would track more vitamins and minerals. It is interesting to see what nutrients I don’t normally get enough of. The information helps me to make food choices that will fill what I am lacking in my diet. I would love to see more minerals and vitamins added to the nutrition panel. It would also be awesome if my fitness Pal would recommend foods that I should eat next to help gain those nutrients not yet filled for the day. I would give this app 5 stars for that upgrade and I would be willing to pay for it. As of now I use this app the most but I also use the Wholesome app to learn both my micro and macro nutrients. It is time consuming to log food in both apps. I would love for my fitness pal to do both.

                      Title: Everything I need!

This app has an incredible database of food. I’m impressed with the number of product specific foods and regional choices. I like being able to track my weight over time. I like being able to add exercise and water tracking. I really like seeing a breakdown of my macro and micro nutrients. I can adjust my nutritional abs weight goals easily. Adding foods to your diary gets easier as the app keeps a record of what foods you’ve entered before. I’ve created my own recipes and added those to the database. It’s a very user friendly program. Occasionally there are errors in the nutritional info, but that’s easy to forgive given all of the other strengths of this app.  I’ve checked out a few of the other tracking apps and I find this one to be far superior. I don’t even use the premium version and I love it.

                      Title: Love it!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I absolutely love this app. It has helped me not only lose weight (40 lbs) in 5 months.. yes in a completely healthy way eating constantly (it felt like). It helped me to see everything I was doing wrong when it came to heath, and getting what I need from food to be healthy. I never would have known that my diet was lacking iron, and calcium on a daily basis it it wasn’t for My fitness pal. I would recommend this app to anyone who is trying to be healthy. It is amazing for losing weight especially when you finish logging for the day, and it tells you what you will weigh in 5 weeks ( everyone needs encouragement and it’s a great tool for that). I would recommend anyone try this app though just to look at what they really put in there body on a daily basis. Little changes in diet can change big things with health!!

                      Title: Makes calorie counting Easy!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app. It’s so easy to scan barcodes to enter calories. Or, you can search for the food. It has lots of different brands and restaurant menus in its database. I love being able to create recipes, which I can add each time I have a serving of leftovers or remake the dish. It’s nice to track your weight in the same app, and I love that it tells you what you’d weigh in a month “if every day was like today” (so motivating)! It’s nice that it shows you protein/carbs/fat and can point out which foods are high in vitamins. My husband can look at my diary and copy my meals, when I make us both dinner. I can’t think of anything bad. I guess, it’d be nice if you could add a recipe to a recipe (like, I have homemade taco seasoning that I use in other recipes; but to add ingredients, I can only scan a barcode or search).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Used to be a great tool (5 stars) & know their team must be doing everything they can to keep it that way.  Since ua sold they apparently don’t have funding to keep the speed up? Or ?? It’s so slow & glitchy it’s frustrating. Know you all must be working hard, hope you’re able to find a way to bring back the interface so it’s more reliable & responsive. Plus side is the database (when it works) & the ability to customize, add your own recipes, etc. This app has allowed me to fine tune my diet so I’m eating more nutritionally than ever & have hard data to tweak what I eat based on how my body responds to different foods. Would love to have more micronutrients tracked even if it means we have to update the database ourselves. If you plug in a place for magnesium, etc we can do the rest. Love that you’ve added vitamin d & ‘added sugar’ & have potassium shown, etc. Thanks & cheers!

I’ve been using My Fitness Pal for years mostly for maintaining a healthy weight and good nutrition. In the past year my mother has moved in and requires several dietary restrictions. My Fitness Pal has become a major tool in handling these restrictions. The premium version gives me every thing I need to make sure she gets what she needs and especially helps with her carb/sugar intake as well as her sodium intake. Being able to add your own recipes allows you to adjust favorite recipes OR see that they’re not going to work at all.

                      Title: Fitness portion underwhelming
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I used this app previously for logging calories -which it works fine for - but decided to get a subscription to try a workout plan. The exercises themselves are fine but the app is terrible! There aren’t any audio cues to guide you except for one annoying bell at the end of each exercise. So unless you’re staring at your phone the whole time you don’t know what exercise you’ll be doing, you won’t know when the countdown to the next exercise ends, and you won’t know when the rest periods are. This is literally the worst exercise app I’ve ever used (and I mean literally...literally). Oh and if you miss a workout you can’t go back to it - if you’re on day 7 then you’ll be doing the workout for day 7. So if you missed the workout on day 6 but day 7 is a rest day then you can’t do a workout. 😣Luckily I had a month trial so I could cancel my subscription.

This app is easy to use, helps lose weight and stay on track, holds you accountable, and shows daily macro and micro nutrients. You can scan barcodes on food, which makes tracking easy. I love all the articles and tidbits of info from the app. At the end of the day when you complete your diary, a note pops up saying what your weight will be in 5 weeks if you keep eating the same. This is very motivating to me because it shows long term progress.

This is seriously the best app ever to easily track your food for calorie count, macros, micronutrients, progress (all sorts of measurements other than weight), and so much more. There’s recipe ideas, you can connect with friends and see progress, you can edit your macro goals, input your own recipes from the web (or manually) and swap out the generic suggestions for what you are actually using and honestly everything you can think of. It helped me lose weight years ago and helps me be on top of my diet now again— down 15 lbs! The free version allows you to do all that I just mentioned. It’s seriously my best weight loss tool, and I would recommend it 100% in a heart beat. Hard to say what can even be improved on it to be honest!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently I am tracking micros and love the feature of providing specific numbers, other apps I have tried have limits to this feature. The recipes are great too with the exception of not having serving size. I have read the comments provided by MyFitness Pal regarding this issue. It’s slightly inconvenient but not enough to not use the recipe feature. The only critique I would have is the accessibility to modify your daily defaults goals. Such changing your workout days to adjust macros. This requires going through multiple steps with your profile. It would be great if it would be more accessible, such as at the bottom of the diary. Otherwise I absolutely love this app!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s a good app that helps you track your daily intake as well as it can. Issues are finding the right foods and getting the portions correct. The recipe creator is a bit finicky as well, makes it hard to get the servings correct. Sometimes it says the food I make is hundreds of calories more per serving then intended. But being able to import the recipes found online is awesome. Just make sure you edit the ingredients it pulls because sometimes it uses higher calorie foods then what you may have used. All in all it’s ok and does what it needs to. Helps you get a feel for just how much you may be consuming in not just calories but in macros and micros.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app. It has calorie counts for most of the most common foods. It gives you a breakdown on carbohydrates, fats and protein. It keeps track of your sodium, and you can track your weight all for free. It takes me so long to lose 10 pounds, that I just can’t afford monthly fees. I also like to cook one meal for the whole family and I don’t like eating “special diet food”. This program allows me to lose weight while just eating regular food and simply counting calories and recording exercise. It also gives you a direct relationship between calories eaten and calories burned so if I eat more one day I know to exercise a little more on that day as well.

Fitnesspal suddenly stopped pulling in steps data.

There is no way to manually enter steps and no way to force sync when sync isn’t happening. Have had sync problems periodically in the past where sync is delayed, which defeats the purpose of having this app to make food choices. App also provides no indication of what failed. Data just doesn’t show up, and there is no way to fix the problem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, I’ve lost weight. I lost weight with weight watchers and others. What is bothersome working with this app is that it hamstrings the whole food, non-processed food adherents. For example, I have a recipe that calls for Salsa Verde. I won’t use store bought Salsa with high sodium content and God knows what else. I will make the stuff myself with tomatillo, garlic, Jalapeño, onion, and cilantro and save it as a recipe to use in a Chicken Tomatillo Casserole. In a perfect world with perfect apps, maybe. Each time I save a recipe to use in another recipe it is unavailable in my ingredient search. The same would apply to sauces and spice blends that are used in my kitchen. I have a work around for this deficiency: work harder while my dinner gets cold. If you fix this, I may give it a better review.

This app is probably to go-to for nutrition tracking. Pretty much any food you can think of is already preselectable in a database, and then the app tracks all your macro and micronutrients, as well as water intake, as you go. It also tracks calories burned and exercises done, but I don’t mess with that feature too much. Great app, but I have some features that I think should exist, and some general gripes:

                      Title: Love this app!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Great app to help you see EXACTLY what you’re putting into your body. Not only is it a great way to keep track of your macros/caloric intake but also what vitamins you’re lacking and/or getting a surplus of. For me, it’s so easy to just eat whatever I want and not fully realize how many grams of sugar or total carbs or amount of fat those amazingly delicious items have. This app really breaks it all down and the numbers don’t lie. If you’re serious, or even just at all curious, about getting healthy.. track your food. Do it for a week. See what happens. It’s an eye opener, or at least was for me. Great work MyFitnessPal, keep up the good work!

                      Title: This App is Great - But just a Quick Suggestion
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm an active 30-something woman whom was recently diagnosed w/Pulmonary Embolism due to birth control pills. Now that I'm on a blood thinner for 3-6months, I have to watch my Vitamin K intake. I have used this app for a good long while and I love it. My only suggestion: Is there any possible way to get a Vitamin K read on here? I have to use another app (I won't name names) to track my Vitamin K and it's horrible! It's cumbersome, it doesn't keep track of your regular foods so you have to keep entering them manually, etc. It's no where near as user friendly as My Fitness Pal. So, with that being my only "problem," I would certainly recommend this app to anyone!  Thanks for your time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m sure the paid version is as good as everyone says but forget taking it for a free spin to check it out first. They have the most aggressive ad campaign I’ve ever seen on an app. It was almost unusable because of the constant interference from multiple ads in multiple formats on each and every page - to buy everything from the application itself to clothes. It won’t  show the price of joining until you actually sign up for a trial period that automatically renews itself, through your iTunes account. You have to give up some pretty important health details that I wouldn’t want anyone else have. I am tired of having to give up my personal info to get apps that just want to sell to you. I’m at the point where there’s a line that I can’t step over any more. I wouldn’t buy it just on principle.

I’ve been using this consistently since April 9th and I’ve lost 15lbs in a month! It has 99% of the food I scan in the database, and most exercises though I do have to create some. It super useful for tracking your macros as well and warns you when you’re in danger of eating too much sugar, sodium, or fat. It has helpful articles regularly, as well as recipes. I love the Twitter/Facebook vibe it gives you on the main page as well. Overall this app is AMAZING, for real. I could never be as successfully heathy and excited to be so, without this app. Thank you very much to the creators! 5 out of 5 from me.

I had struggle losing weight in a healthy manner and putting on good muscle. This kept all my macro and micro nutrient in checks and i could also see my vitamin consumption. This really works if you use it properly and set goals and try to be within a good range of your target, losing weight is easy. The best part is you don’t have to enter things every time. Snap a barcode or choose a ready made meal and you can easily approximate how much nutrients you are getting. Very accurate. Be honest with yourself and this will pay off within 2 months guarantee you can lose 10-15 pounds.

Also, it would be awesome on the premium version if when you look at your nutrition for the day and click on say fiber or vitamin A it lists different healthy options for getting more of what you guys suggest we need more of like for fiber prunes for example or berries. It would save me a lot of time because at this point I see what I’m lacking in, then I have to google what I can eat to get me on track when it would be so much easier and helpful for you guys to add a link to each one showing your healthy suggestions.

Food and exercise trackers are a great tool to help educate folks about portion size and balanced nutrition. While MFP led the way for a long time, it is now nearly worthless because it relies too much on user supplied nutrition data. Many users enter only calorie amounts for a food, ignoring macro and micronutrients (thus depriving other users of beneficial knowledge). Oftentimes portion sizes are skewed Or the numbers entered are simply wrong. The app offers a way for other users to confirm or correct the data, but this feature seems little used.

I think added a bunch more of vitamins and minerals tracking would really set this app ahead of its competitors by a long shot. Also, if we could change the units of measure of vitamins and minerals instead of a 100% daily intake measure which does not tell you at all what you are looking for

The only thing I wish is that there was a spot for supplements. I currently put them under snacks even though most apps have a snack spot between each meal or a bunch at the bottom. I wish there was more than one snack option so I could keep track of when and why I’m more ironed to snacking.

On WiFi, the search feature and barcode scanner frequently lag out (tried different WiFi and confirmed connectivity). When you build a meal it adds each ingredient to the food log instead of a single line (so you can’t edit the portion size - you have to add the meal again or delete/re add or adjust each item.. it starts getting to be a long list under the log and hard to tell what exactly you’ve eaten on a given day). Many other complaints. The app is tolerable if you use it for short periods of weight loss, but this wouldn’t be my choice for daily ongoing use.

Macros are great to track but I think the quality of those macros is more important and it’s hard to know and track all that information. And I think everyone should be allowed that knowledge. Besides that, this app has been great for keeping me on track!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app I recommend to ANYONE who wants to achieve their weight goals. Whether it’s to gain or lose pounds, my fitness pal can assist you with vital info helping to monitor food intake. But even more important, helping me to identify things that attribute to roadblocks obtaining that fit body. Like ;, sodium ,sugar and carbs which can limit my results if I’m not aware of my intake of those things. Well thanks to my fitness pal I don’t worry about that anymore.

If you use it properly and are diligent about tracking your food and fitness, like the application intends you to, you will lose weight, period. As a former 230lb person who has tried all of the fad diets (Keto, etc.) and lots of supplements, I can assure you that this works. I started on May 13 at 188lbs and I’m now at 169lbs on June 23 (of the same year). I’m a 31 year old male who is 5 foot 7 inches.

By creating daily micro habits, you are in total control of what you will become. The lack of  “Accountability,” is where a large percentage of your goals are not met. When you track and document your daily micro habits; what you eat, workout routine, read, watch, etc...they become your Habits. This app helps me stay on track of my goals. Scanning the ingredients and portions of what I eat is super easy, and ridiculously fast!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have used the app daily for a month as a premium user. You can scan barcodes, copy foods from the day before, and track Macros/micros with the paid plan. You can not always log food via grams or ounces alone. The app tends to offer you whatever serving unit (cups, ounces, etc.) is on the food that you use and asks that you calculate what fraction of the serving you ate. I rather Noom’s way of calculating food where EVERY food can be logged via 1 ounce or gram or cup of the food and the app does the calculations for you. It’s a solid app but not the best out there.

I enjoy the fact that in the app it tells you a food is high in vitamin C or protein, but also tell you if the food is high in bad things like sodium. I also appreciate the micros, it will show how much of fat, carbohydrates, and protein you’ve consumed that day. So if you’re trying to up your protein it will show how much percentage of protein you consumed. It really helps when thinking about healthy food choices and what you should eat to reach your goals.

I used to be able to be able to adjust what I see on the main tracking page - fiber and sodium was of a couple of them I had for easy tracking. Now I have to constantly go back and forth between the nutrition and the main tracking page to see my overall sodium and fiber intake - it’s tedious. I’ll definitely be looking for a new app if things don’t improve.

Ridiculous that they don’t have this feature in the paid version.

The new update is a cheap trick in an attempt to get users to upgrade to the version requiring a significant monthly fee.  They removed important features in this latest update...shame on you.  Now, the diary no longer shows important nutrients like carbs, fat, protein, sodium, and sugar.  This is a serious issue for diabetics counting carbs for every meal and snack.  They did this to force you to upgrade which requires a monthly fee.  If you want to charge a one-time fee like some other great apps like Procreate, that’s fine; however changing your app to require a monthly fee is inexcusable.

Needless to say, this is a huge disappointment. I guess I’ll be researching other apps.

I like getting reminders to log, but only if I really haven’t done it!

I’ve been way of using the guessing game when it comes to meal planning and hitting my macros.  Like way off.  Thanks to this app, I’ve dialed in and fine tuned a diet plan that’s fail proof.  I love that I can scan everything too.  Even my vitamins 😱

--------------------------------------------------------------------

myfitnesspal has been very helpful in my weight loss journey. its a great way to track calories and exercises throughout your day. you can set your own calorie goals along with daily protein, potassium, and sodium goals each day. the only reasons i didn’t rate it  5 stars is because sometimes it doesn’t recognize bar codes, and also when you don’t reach your calorie goal is doesn’t show you an estimated weight. otherwise it is a very helpful app and i would recommend using it for weight loss and weight maintenance.

Periodically refuses to allow the amount of food in a serving to be changed from what was entered in the past. If I had a third of a cup of cottage cheese (for example) one day, and then the next day a quarter cup, My Fitness Pal fights with me when I try to use the fraction or decimal counter to enter the amount of food to reflect the most recent serving. It also usually won't allow the amount to be entered manually as a decimal--I can't enter 0.25 cups, it won't accept input of the 0.XX number and shows, in this case, 25 cups. This happens occasionally, but more and more often, and usually after an update.

                      Title: Mistakes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I don’t remember how long ago I installed the MyFitnessPal app, but it’s been a long time. I remember when I was setting it up, it asked me for a goal weight, I entered a number pretty much knowing it was a number I would never reach. Fast forward to three years ago, Oct. 2, 2017, I entered my first meal, which started my tracking at each meal I ate. I loved the ability to add in my recipes, and then the ability to share with my husband, via iMessage, at each meal. That ONE little feature has changed our lives for the better. Right now? Not so much. In this latest update, you deleted the one feature that has been the most valuable to me/us. Not everybody wants to share their food diary and especially not until the end of the day. If a person is going to use this tool properly, you need to enter your food at each meal so that you can keep up with your calorie intake PLUS your micronutrients (we both pay for the premium app features!). What good does a weight loss tool do you when you have to wait til the end of the day to enter food from another persons diary, only to possibly find out you have gone over your daily goals? I used to brag and push this tool to others... but now? Now, I am actually searching for another tool, because for me, you deleted that one key element. I don’t WANT to change apps, my whole weight loss journey is logged in this app, because of being able to log as I eat and share recipes/foods, AS WE EAT, I have lost over half of my body weight! Remember that “fictitious” weight goal number I entered? I have surpassed it by 15 pounds. If anybody who is anybody, at MyFitnessPal, reads this review, I wholeheartedly ask you to please consider adding that one small, but VERY IMPORTANT, feature BACK in to this app... the ability to share each dish and/or recipe AT EACH MEAL, with the person who is sitting across the table from me. I’m getting tired of entering recipes on two different phones/apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was fortunate throughout my life to not have to worry about what I ate as far as weight gain goes. Once I was in peramenopause I started to gain weight. Over a two-year period I gained 12 pounds and was completely confused as to why I put on the weight, and how I was going to lose it. For someone who never had to diet before, I was at a loss. I mention something to my niece who is very physically fit, and very weight conscious and she turned me onto this app. I lost all 12 pounds, and I'm working on losing an additional 4 pounds which will put me back into where I have been weight wise throughout most of my life. I was told by so many people that I had to just except weight gain as a part of menopause. I'm so glad I didn't listen to those people, because I tried accepting the weight gain for two years and was totally unhappy with it. If you want to lose weight try this program, it works! It makes you very aware of what you're putting in your mouth, the nutritional value of what you're eating, and how much mindlessly eating you're doing. I cheat every once in a while, but I go right back on the program the day after I've cheated. So, especially for those of you who are in peramenopause or menopause, don't accept the weight gain! Go on this program and you'll go back to the body that you had before menopause. Now, you won't have the body you had a 25 years old, but you'll be very happy with what you see when you look in the mirror!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have lost 8 lbs. In 4 weeks, and I do nothing!  Occasional exercise, but nothing all that time consuming.  The food data base is amazing, and if it's not there, then you add it yourself!  It can be frustrating and time consuming to set up and become familiar with this app, but the pay off is incredible.  I try to stay away from processed food.  Well, no problem!  There is a recipe button that allows you to enter the quantities of ingredients in the food you make.  It calculates the calories per serving for you.  Easy.  The pie graphs and daily breakdowns tell you whether you are meeting you vitamin, protein, fat, carb, cholesterol, etc. requirements.  At the end of the day, you can record your daily progress; and the app will tell you that "...if you eat like this every day you'll weigh (blank) amount in 5 weeks.  You can record your measurements and weight to track your progress.  Record exercise and water intake.  There is a notes section for both exercise and diet if you need it.  And you can do this with your friends!  It has a friend interface like FB so you can give your friends support, engage in competition, compare and contrast, etc.  This app keeps you informed about what you put into your body and helps you realize how important it is to eat the propper foods to stay content on a reduced calorie diet.  Make the correct choices and you will stay full on a 1200 cal diet.  Splurge and go hungry!

I love this app. The database of items continues to amaze me. I love the ease of creating my own recipes by using my camera to scan the ingredient barcodes. My use of this app is less about counting calories and more about tracking tracking the nutrients I am consuming. The reporting of this info is very good but I would like to drill down and see details around the nutrients on the report. For example, if my sodium consumption is too high, I want to click on the sodium and see a list of items that make up my sodium and the % of my total each item represents. That would allow me to adjust my diet and eliminate unwanted sodium, or any other nutrient I wish to control.

Rather than avoiding foods i am trying to figure what i can eat and come out with the right calories and vitamins: its kind of a game. I dont feel deprived at all. I think i really had no idea how many calories were in things. It turns out to be pretty easy to loose weight with this app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

i've been using this app for about 6 weeks now. and i won't say how much weight i've gotten rid of, but i will say that it's more than i've ever lost in a similar period before. this app is very easy to use. it's very intuitive. it makes sense. the goals are clear, and the database is HUGE. i've only run across a couple of items that it didn't have, and i was able to approximate those. the "my recipes' function is especially helpful. you just put in all the ingredients for a recipe, and how many servings it is, and the app calculates the calories and the other nutritional information per serving. then you save it, and whenever you have that recipe you've got all the info. if you tend to eat the same things, you can create a meal and it will load all the information the next time you have that meal. once you lose 10 pounds it automatically recalculates your goals. i haven't had any problems with it. i don't use facebook or twitter, but the "news feed" on the home screen offers little bits of motivation even without posting them anywhere.  so all in all, i HIGHLY recommend this app to anyone who is trying to watch what they eat, and wants a simple way to do it.

                      Title: Meal Content Add-ups
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is such a great app and I use it everyday to track all of my calories and workouts. I love the feature of being able to see the total fat, calories, protein, sugar, etc., that I am allotted each day and through this, I have actually become aware that I don't have enough iron or potassium in my diet -- something I would not have known without the feature in this app! However, the reason I am giving four stars instead of five is because I would like to have just one small improvement made. On the screen where you can add your foods and it categorizes them into breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack, it gives the total calories for the whole meal, but I would LOVE if I could click on the meal type (lunch for instance) and see how much total fat, carbs, protein, etc., was in just that one whole category, rather than having to click on each item I entered to see how much fat each item contained and then add them all up. Like I said, I like the feature that shows you how much fat you've had so far and how much more you're allotted, but I would really love to also be able to see what the nutrition is for each individual category as well. Hope to see this improvement in the next update! Thanks!

                      Title: I love this app but....
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app has been essential to my weight loss journey. I've been using it for more than a year and it has been incredibly helpful in helping me manage calories, sodium, fat, etc. and keep track of how much weight I'm losing. I love this app! The only issue that I've encountered multiple times and more frequently lately is that a lot of the items I scan the barcode on do not come up with the correct nutrition. Also a lot of the verified items are not the correct nutrition information. Why add a verified feature if it isn't even the correct information? There should be a way to edit this information and send proof (picture of nutrition label) so that someone can actually verify it. Even if it's just a feature to edit the scanned item just for yourself. I've noticed that in order to edit an item you have to go online which is inconvenient. I think a lot of people are scanning the barcode and not checking to see if the information is correct. Please fix this. Otherwise this app is amazing and I highly recommend it if you want to take control of your life and need help cutting down.

                      Title: Lost more than 50 lbs...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Using this app.  Of course, I exercised and made sure to follow the app's guidelines on how many calories I should eat to obtain my goal.  I found tracking ever single thing I ate was hugely beneficial. I was surprised at how many calories I was actually consuming and could remove items that didn't seem "worth" it to me.  They could improve their list of items able to scan to include grocery store meat and deli but that's really my only criticism.  If I do a manual search, I can find the item.  Since I eat pretty much the same items every week (maybe weekends are a bit more exciting), I found that once my key foods were in, I could easily choose them over and over.  If you want to track your calories, then this is a fabulous app to make that an easier process.  I've used it for years and have no plans to change that.  Even though I've lost the weight I wanted to lose, I still use to stay on track.  I also like looking at the nutrition feature to see where my vitamin intake may be lacking.  There aren't a whole lot to track in the free version, but it's enough.  Good luck with your journey 👍

                      Title: A Must Have for Dieting!!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is a must for dieting and losing weight. I keep track so much better, and the barcode is very convenient. I love that when you complete your entry at the end of the day, it says, "If every day were like today, you'd weigh ___ in 5 weeks." I love using this app with dieting. When I used to diet, I'd eat small amounts often, but not worry about the amount of calories. I found out that I was actually eating too few calories, which is why I'd give up by the second week - because I was so hungry and fatigued. My Fitness Pal does all the work for you, and lets you know how many calories you have remaining for the day. It is so convenient to always have the app with you on your phone! I also love that you can view your daily values of everything. I learned that I am good when it comes to fiber (which was a surprise), but my sodium and sugars are ridiculously high. It's fun to compare day to day, and aim for improvement with specific areas, not just the number of calories. I lost 5 pounds during my first week using this app, which was a pleasant surprise. That's a lot for me. I love this app, and highly recommend it!

36 pounds and counting!!!  I did start with another app (I shall leave it nameless)....however, every time I hit a ten pound milestone, it reduces my calories SIGNIFICANTLY.  At one point it actually suggested my daily caloric intake be 846!  Being in the medical profession, I knew how dangerous- not to mention deadly- that could be. A friend suggested My Fitness Pal.  LOVE IT.  After a month the app suggested the upgraded version. If you're on the fence and you're serious about health, fitness and weight loss the CORRECT AND HEALTHY way...go for it.  Best thing I did for my weight loss journey.  I am also vegan, so it was important for me to monitor my protein intake, etc.  The upgraded version is awesome. I can actually track my vitamin and mineral intake within the food I consume!  It gives me warnings if my carbs are high, and if I reach my goals.   The list of available foods to choose from is vast so I never worry I cannot find what I have consumed.  I am a huge foodie and love to cook....the premium upgrade allows you the option of uploading a recipe and then converts it for you!  You can manually input a recipe as well.  Best app I've ever purchased.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.

                      Title: Great, but...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Best app I've used for food tracking. Almost everything I've scanned the barcode for has been found (though occasionally missing some of the information. Probably more of a factor of bad data entry than an issue with the app. ) Using this does make a person (at least it makes me) a bit obsessive about tracking food. I can't believe the things I was eating before and I struggle with sodium levels even eating what anyone would normally consider absurdly healthy food now. The syncing with other apps (Health, MMF, Garmin Connect, Wahoo) is hit or miss and I get regular duplication, usually fixable just by deleting one. The names of the activity don't always come through, though. Registering 30 minutes of shoveling snow in MMF comes through as "walking" in MFP. The calorie count is right, just the labeling is wrong and not editable in this app. Surprising that the two don't sync better since they're both UA. Biggest complaint is the upgrade cost. $50 for just a year? Pretty absurd. I'd gladly pay a $20 one time upgrade and probably think seriously about $50 if it were only once, but recurring fees are a bane and it's probably costing UA some customers in this case.

                      Title: Great app for getting to the truth
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a health coach who uses and recommends this app. It  has helped me and several clients discover underlying deficiencies or overages in their diet. One found a huge potassium and sodium imbalance that linked directly to bloating.  Potassium intake adjustments made a huge difference in her life. Another though she was doing well with simple carbs through portion control, but the sugar breakdown helped her self-correct. I eat almost entirely whole, unprocessed foods. I have found I have to enter specific names of foods like "roasted sweet potato" to find what I am looking for. If you type in salt for a recipe, it won't come up, but sea salt will.  This is a small inconvenience for the HUGE database of information available and the ability to create and store my own recipes and meals. I lost 35 lbs a couple of years ago using medi-fast. Since then I have converted to a whole food, unprocessed diet. I want to lose 10 more lbs with real food. This app is helping this 50+, post-menopausal woman to do just that. If you give it good information, you can really drill down and figure out just what is going on. Highly recommend.

I am a personal trainer and tried several of the top rated apps for calorie counting diet and exercise. I like MyFitnessPal even better than another one that I paid for. It has a thorough food list and I love that you can add your own foods and exercises that you know the calorie information for. It also saves your typical foods and allows you to add multiple foods from your frequent list at once, so you can enter typical meals quickly. Another option I liked was that the food list includes vitamin and protein supplements, so if you take any supplements these can factor into your nutritional summary. You can even track your water intake.

                      Title: Amazing Potential
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Would give 6 stars but this app is just not sexy or useful without digging deep. The front page is bland and totally unappealing. It should be a modern dashboard with vitals not a information feed. I am not a baby and want my dashboard not congratulations messages taking up real estate. The food database is A+ and live the way you can scan food in. Graph choices are.....one. % of fat to carbs to protein. Who cares? I want options of % carbs to max allowable for example. Or % of calcium to max allowable. Someone made the wrong call that we only want to measure fat, carbs and protein against themselves. Really? Again I am not a baby and want to USE the amazing data that this program has to offer in ways THAT I CHOOSE. It's the best out there but just not good looking at all or configurable. It's sad. Someone needs to redesign this app. We are adults not 10 year olds. The social media and coaching focus in the daily feed is annoying to some like me. I want an app like this only one that lets ME focus on how I am going to lose weight, not one that assumes there is only one way. For example I am loosing a pound a day using low carb approach. Not much room for that in this app. There needs to be space for me to adjust my own approach and for me to turn off all the noise of the feed. The interface needs to catch up with the database.

                      Title: Good at calorie counting not so good at measuring calorie expenditure
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an excellent app. particularly considering it's free. It's great at helping keep track of how many calories you're consuming.  But it's not so good at measuring how many calories you've expended in exercise.  On Sunday for example, I ran almost 9 miles.  I should note that I am not using Fitbit or any other such device.  I run with my iPhone strapped to my arm so that phone is the only source of data.  According to FitnessPal I expended 345 calories in running 9 miles.  However, by the calculator built in to FitnessPal, I should have used about 1,000 calories in running for that period of time.  This is only one of several recent examples where FitnessPal failed to register what I believe is the accurate number of calories.  It didn't used to be this way but over the past few months I've noticed this problem.  Perhaps it's better with Fitbit or another such device – but it no longer seems to work that well with the built-in iPhone exercise app.  I should mention that another app, Stepz, had me expending approximately 840 calories during that run  – still a little bit light I believe but closer to the mark than FitnessPal.

I downloaded this app, not to lose weight necessarily, but just to see how many calories and grams of fat and protein I intake regularly. It's been a real eye-opener, that's for sure! I've learned that what I'd estimated in the past about serving sizes of specific foods has been wrong wrong wrong! I had been eating too large of portions of things like chips and sweets and eating too small of portions of things like bread and veggies. I am a vegan and this app has also shown me that I am not getting enough calcium, so now i try to eat more foods that are rich in calcium.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my favorite nutrition calculator so far! I also tried the Livestrong My Plate, but its not as thorough on evaluating all the nutrition facts of your food and adding them up. I like to know if I can actually get enough vitamins through my food as well or if I need to supplement.  My Fitness Pal has a huge data base; comprehensive nutritional calculations including main vitamins, not just calories, fat, carbs, and protein counts; barcode scanner for quickly finding packaged food.  If you eat a lot of the same foods, it becomes faster and easier to track over time. I like this waayyy more then "dieting," because I don't completely restrict myself. Instead I stick better to moderation and never feel deprived. I'm more motivated to get my workouts in, so I have more flexibility to eat more if I want. I've already seen results in 1.5 week of 2 lbs lost and I feel great. I didn't realize how much I was over eating until now. I calculate now and I never feel deprived, instead I'm more knowledgable of my nutrition and feel more balanced. :)

Tried the app before in 2012 then left. I returned last week and am very happy with new changes. I love the accuracy of calories for nutritional values.  My wicked nemesis bubble tea is also included. That's my frenemie. It's easy to add new meals and calculate yourself. You can easily sync your tracker device. I have a fit bit pedometer. But u won't need one. I sync a lot of my other fitness apps to it. It's so easy. I got my bf on this app. Im trying to get my whole family on it. It showed me my sodium intake was way too high. I didn't even realize that 1 slice of deli turkey has about the total amt of sodium than we need in a day. It's teaching me a lot. It's also has the 5 wk prediction of what your weight could be if u continue eating habits of that day. The only things I would change is to have the fit bit info combined w this app to give more accurate in calculations. Right now the calculations seen a lil off. Also I would include motivational challenges like those in the lose it! App. Lose it ! Tracks what u eat or how u work out and that's added motivation to c u almost completed a challenge.

I've been gaining lots if weight lately, so I had to do something! This app is soooo easy and makes it so visual that's it's all simple math... If I eat more (adds calories), I need to do some exercise (subtract calories). Makes it so easy to stay under my required calories every day.   They have every food and I love scanning foods! My favorite part is after I complete the entry for the day, it tells me, if every day were like today, how much I'm likely to weigh in five weeks! That is sooooo encouraging (and a reality check for the day I pigged out!). I also love that I can see all the nutritional information.. I knew I was low on Iron, but seeing It right in front of me encouraged me to take an Iron supplement every day! I also see that I need more fiber and potassium..This app seriously changed the way I view food, how I eat, exercise and I'm watching the weight drop off! It's so cool!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is the best, WAY better than Wt Watchers: it's free, and there is not one food that's not listed - seems like the lists are endless. The fact that you can input weight every day & see a run chart of the trends is great. Plus, you can change the daily calorie limit which is important - great not just to be boxed in to what someone else thinks is the right calorie amount for me. Also, seeing the nutrition breakdown is amazingly helpful: able to keep track of sodium, carbs, sugar, fiber, protein, etc. They do need to add Zumba to the exercises. There should be a way to add some value for pedometer daily steps, and then give a run chart - even just to track over time (if you're trying to go from, say, 10,000 steps per day to 15,000.) It's definitely not just a Fitness App. (It should be called My Better Health Pal because good nutrition, weight loss, and improved fitness are all key, for me anyway.)  To summarize: I love it - I'm telling everybody - it's amazing & it's FREE, what?!? One of the best apps I've ever used. Exactly what I wanted. Thank you --

I'll qualify this by saying this us the first App review i have ever taken the time to write. Being an extremely busy middle-aged corporate executive Mom of a special needs child, as well as battling lupus, weight management is only one aspect I need to be continually mindful of. After using Weight Watchers online program religiously for a year and not only stalling out, but feeling continually exhausted trying to stay under my daily allotted points, I was feeling very frustrated. I stumbled across your App by accident and decided to give it a shot. I LOVE THIS APP! Not only am I able to track calories and activity, I can scan packaged foods with ease, sync with fitness apps to reduce the amount of time logging activity, and most importantly, view daily reports of essential nutrient intake and be notified when I fall short of calcium, potassium and other crucial nutrients. I love the fact this App is mindful of holistic health, not simply "staying under my points" and achieving a goal weight. I look forward with excitement to ongoing updates to this App!

I really love My Fitness Pal!! This app has helped me lose some unwanted weight and it has also taught me more about my food choices than I have ever known:) I've been able to change some of the things I was eating in order to get the nutritional value that I need to get from my food each day. I was eating way to many carbs, too much sodium and wasn't even close on my calcium, iron, potassium and vitamin A intake either. Just by making a few small changes to my diet, my weight is down where I need it to be and my blood pressure is no longer borderline:)!! All of this without adding any exercise either. My job is very sedentary, so I told the app I wanted to lose a pound per week while being sedentary. This wonderful app calculated everything for me and it delivered big time.  If you can log the food you eat each day, you'll be amazed at how much this app will help you take control of your diet, weight and health!!! You should definitely get this app right now and use it every day!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was diagnosed with PH from an atrial septal defect at the end of 2014. Medications don't seem to be helping so my doctor recommended a low sodium diet.  She sent me to a nutritionist who specializes with heart patients and she gave me lots of information, including apps that help track not only your vitamins, protein, fat, and carbs, but also your sodium.  This app was on her recommendation list.  Not only that, but you can set those stats to different goals. I set mine to make sure I don't go over 1,500 mg of sodium per day.  Thanks to this app I know what I should avoid, what's ok to have, and I can even watch my calories although it's not my main concern to count calories, mostly just watching my sodium.  It's helped me drop 4 pounds in the last 2 weeks.  Who knew watching your sodium would make you lose weight? Everyone always says to watch sugar and fat, but all I've been doing is watching my sodium and the pounds are falling every week. It also counts the steps you take so you can figure out how active you are, and that can help you decide how active you should be.

                      Title: so far so good
--------------------------------------------------------------------

So far this app's been really helpful. Once I got into a habit of doing it, I don't forget about typing in entries. It also helps me realize just how much food I have been actually consuming each day. I'm not particularly heavy, sitting around the middle zone of the 'normal weight' BMI zone. But I'm also not tall, and being 'average weight' (especially in American standards, which is very generous in what it counts as average) at the height of 5'3" isn't really the ideal figure I'd like. I want to shed the last few pounds that people have told me are the hardest to lose, and this app helps me keep track. It also makes you feel pretty good every time you enter in your exercise amount and watch your calorie allowance for the day go up. I especially love the nutritional breakdown, because I'm also trying to be healthier in what I eat in general. After watching it for a few days I realized I was almost always very low in vitamin A and calcium, so I am now eating to replenish them. Overall, smooth-running and helpful app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Seriously saved me. I knew I needed to make a change and this app has helped me concentrate on that. It has all the foods I need to enter and it even has regional foods like restaurants that are not national chains but only have maybe a few locations. I love that it has a reminder that will tell you that you haven't logged in today and that you need to enter your breakfast or your lunch. I love that it will tell you when you're not getting enough calories and remind you that that isn't good for you. I love that it tracks your steps and gives you calories credit for doing so. I love feeling like I'm accountable to something and it's a great tool to help me along my weight-loss journey. I love how complete and comprehensive exercise list is. I love you can enter different kinds of goals like how much protein you want to have a day or how much sugar or sodium intake and that the app will tell you when you've met your goal or when you've gone over etc. this app is worth it's weight in gold.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I LOVE myfitnesspal, it's the app I use most often!! I find it to be far superior to the other calorie tracking apps I've tried. I love that it gives you list, graph & pie chart viewing options to stay on top of both daily & weekly statistics. I love how the nutritional intake listing also tracks potassium, vitamins a & c, calcium & iron intakes. The fact that you can also keep careful watch over the types of fats you are consuming (fats, sat fats, poly/monounsaturated & trans fats) is wonderful! The only thing I'd change is the format of the added foods list... everything is placed in no particular order, so searching for foods becomes tedious; creating alphabetical listings would simplify things. But I love the multi-add feature, it's a true time saver. Plus, this app allows you to track water intake, which is an excellent feature to have! Lazy as I am, I haven't taken advantage of the exercise tracking feature yet, though I do intend to do so very soon, that listing seems very comprehensive. Thumbs up on an awesome app!!! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love the ease and the detail of this application. It is user friendly and has all the information that you need to get in and start losing weight. It's super easy to log and only takes about 10 minutes a day. The application even logs your favorite recipes nutrition! I've been tracking for just over 60 days and have already lost 27 lbs.  The application makes you very aware of what you are putting in your body and allows you to manage your calories, proteins, and carbs with ease. The biggest eye opener for me is the amount of sodium in everything. By cutting back on salt and drinking at least 10 cups a water a day, the weight loss has been easy and fun! I added a fitbit and the application takes the exercise for the day from fitbit and adjusts calories up for the exercise so you can always stay under your max allowed and still feel satisfied. Very happy with MyFitness Pal and highly recommend to get your weight loss kick started. Get it today, you'll LOVE it!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was thankful to find I could enter a recipe I made up and come up with nutritional value. This gives freedom to the user to eat realistic meals. Also it can pull up nutritional values for chain restaurants. Cracker Barrel Panda Express you name it. This app is very personal. It knows foods I buy at world market that seem a bit esoteric. It knows which bottle of coconut oil from the granola grocer lol out of many varieties. It does the same thing to calculate calories burned. I swim. It asked what stroke... What intensity, or treading water at what intensity. Just flop around in the water it figures the calories for that too enter how many minutes and BOOM!!! It calculates for you. I double check on other calculators and the calculations are accurate. U can see minerals and vitamins and fats you are high or low in and see your stats in different visual charts. I can see my nutrition over the past week and caloric intake. I can chart my weight and chat w friends if I want to encourage them. Best program I have found.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

You simply can't find another app that works as well as this one does -- and it does more than any other as well.  I can't say how many times I've been eating snacks or food and just scanned the barcode for the information, or making a meal and had it work.  It works on everything from random food from my Asian market to stuff out of vending machines.  Past that, the ability to track and log nutrition information over time (like cholesterol and sodium) and see how you're doing?  Great.  And exercise?  Easy.  I didn't believe the reviews and ratings before I got the app.  Now I do, and it's worth it.

This is one of the best apps I have ever downloaded, period. It's so simple and easy, and it makes counting calories a snap. The library of foods is humongous, and if you plan right, you can even go out and drink and eat and still lose weight. It's not easy, but this app gives you the framework to successfully track your progress and see how your actions and decisions shape not only your appearance, but your life as well.

I love this app! I love being able to access my food log anytime, anywhere. They have almost every food item and restaurant you could think of. However my favorite part of the app besides it's ease of use is that each day it shows you your daily intake summary. This is so helpful to me, so I can see how much protein I am actually getting and how much I need and it has shown me that my sodium intake is consistently higher than it should. This seriously is the greatest health app I have ever used and it is so easy to keep track of everything I eat. I can move from day to day instantly and the trends section shows me how I have been doing overtime.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm 40+. Diet? Never in my life. Exercise? Meh…Then I downloaded this app for the heck of it, set up my account with a semi-attainable goal weight, and now I'm hooked. I view food differently now. Calories were just scribbles on the packaging before I got this app. Now I count them and cherish them like they are gold. This is a game for me now trying to stay in my calorie allowance for the day. If I go over, I hop on the exercise bike to burn down my numbers. I view food in a whole new light now. I have changed long habits and made better choices. "Knowledge is power" and this app provides just that. The food database is HUGE. The ease of input is welcome. Calories is just one aspect, then you try to stick to your numbers for nutrition levels…now thats a game!! You try to get 100% of your daily allowance of iron and see how hard it is. Love it, great app. And 6 pounds lighter in a week and a half, I can't argue with it effectiveness. But just like anything, you have to want to do it. Great app.

                      Title: Extremely useful app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent app. Easy to make good choices as you can see calories and nutrient levels as you go. The awareness this app gives you makes it easier to achieve weight and fitness goals. Two minor concerns: First it isn't always easy to edit your entry once you have recorded it. You can but it involves some trial and error. And the food database isn't all inclusive. It is sometimes difficult to find the exact or an equivalent item. I often record unsalted butter as regular because the only entries for the former are for a huge amount. Sometimes you have to settle for less than 100% accuracy. Also it will not record amounts under 1200 calories/day. I have sometimes not felt like eating anything and has to enter some false data so the app would record the true data. User should have more control over this. The app could be improved/ expanded by recording more micronutrients. An option I would pay for by subscription or in app purchase. Overall I recommend this app highly.

Started with a Fitbit that was pretty  simple . Had a polar watch with heart monitor and wished I could combine them both . Enter the polar A360 with this app . This app is better than several calorie counters I have used in the past . I'm really liking the scanning feature. Scanning barcodes pulls in all your nutrition information so you can see what your eating too much of ( sugars, fats, even vitamins ) or not enough of  - this app has taken me to a new level in fitness and nutrition . I have stopped taking several vitamins as a result of not needing them after seeing a history of what I eat on a daily basis .it is an awesome calorie app. It reads your habits and adjusts to suit .  As with anything it takes awhile to figure out the entire app . The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the syncing with the watch could be better . No wi fi synching that I see- so plugging the watch into your computer can get daunting at times . Otherwise great , detailed , accurate educational app.

When I first got my ipod, my brother reccomended this app. He has lost 27lbs, and I have lost almost 50lbs with this app. I showed this app to my doctor, because I needed to lose some weight, rather alot of weight, and my doctor thinks this is a great app too. I have quite a bit to go, but it helped me to see what I needed to work on and what foods I was eating that was all wrong for me. I have several health concerns, sodium intake being one, and this helps me to track my sodium intake. So far this app has helped me to take my sodium intake down from 8000+ (yes 8000mg) a day to under 2000mg a day. I would reccomend this app to anyone. I use it in conjunction to the free Weight Watchers app (I'm a member there too), and look forward to losing the weight I need as well as to get a handle on my dietary intake of vitamins and minerals. Thank you so much for this app. Only issue I have with it is I wish the food bank was on a constant update for new foods on the market. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm 16 years old and a year-around swimmer.  I'm currently around a 250 day streak of using this app, and I absolutely love it.  I originally got it because I found out I was eating way too little.  I was averaging around 1,800 calories a day, and now I'm averaging at over 4,000 on days I exercise.  Ironically, I've lost about 15 pounds, and I'm leaner than ever.  I feel great and the app is super helpful with managing my nutrition.  I've gotten big into eating, and living, healthy recently.  I honestly think everyone should use this or something like it, but that's my biased opinion.  However, BE AWARE that this app is a fantastic tool, but if you want ultimate accuracy and health you definitely need to do some nutrition and exercise related research.  Not that it's necessary, but for me I like to be super precise, so I created custom exercises, and I do daily step/digestion calculations, to suit me even better.  Get this app if you want to see a real change in your life.

I've been using for 2.5 months, lost 10 pounds! It keeps me honest so I don't cheat, it tracks more than calories if you scan items or if you enter in supplemental info (fat, carbs, sodium). LOVE IT!! Sooo easy to use. It works!! I've done many diets in past, tracked calories, etc....but this is so convenient. Also love that I can track exercise. It makes me WANT to work out so i can eat more without going over my cal goal for day. I've recommended to everyone I know who is dieting. My friends who are in my news feed are so motivating too! The only thing I can say that needs improvement is the scanning...some items show up as something else, so I don't know if it's an issue with the barcode itself or the database that this app uses. But calories are usually the same anyway so I use the info anyway. I have loved using this and will continue as long as I can!! (my brother-in-law has been using and has lost 121 pounds since January!!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I started using this in the Spring time, May 2014, and I love it! I started working out to lose the baby weight I had from my 3rd pregnancy and this app helped me program what I wanted to lose and how much to lose each week. After you program how much you want to lose or maintain, it will inform you how many calories you will want to eat around. You also get to put down how active you are and modify the amount of weight you want to lose each week. I also love how you can scan the food you eat, this allows you to see exactly what you're eating as well as knowing if that certain food is high or low in sat. fat; cholesterol; vitamin C; etc. I was able to lose 15 pounds within about 3-4 months with this app helping me while I exercise. But remember, it's all about your mind mentality to have this app plus exercising to help you lose weight, maintain weight, or gain muscle/weight.

I've used MyFitnessPal off and on for about three years now. I find it an essential tool in monitoring the nutrition side of a healthy lifestyle. As a diabetic it's important for me to know what can raise and lower my blood sugar. With MFP I not only can monitor this daily, but over lengthier spans of time. There are many features which make my life easier. "Frequent meals" list; recipe listings; and the scanner make entering foods a breeze, but other features which greatly help me are the Food Notes section which I can use for notes like how late I ate a meal; or how long a period lapsed before testing my blood sugar. I couldn't be more grateful that my doctor recommended this app to me. Last thing, in May of 2015, I reached my "Must Act" weight of 300lbs. With MFP, a personal trainer, and good nutrition I've lost over 50lbs. so far. My doctor has taken me off all my medications, and I feel great. This app can definitely help change your life.

This is simply the best app available of its kind, better than the paid apps available. Its the only one that tracks what you really need to watch your health(calories, fat, sat fat, sugar, carbs, protein, sodium, potassium, fiber AND major vitamins).  I had no idea how much sodium I was taking in each day.  I'm astonished how many poor reviews there are of this for things like, "I forgot my paswword so this app is usesless".  People like this are really skewing the reviews of this great app.  The food database is HUGE. It has almost every fast food, regular food, and homemade item you can think of. If it doesn't have it you can add it, and then it will always be there. I love how it saves my recent foods so I can just add them again with the touch of a button. It takes me about 2 minutes a day to add my food, and the benefits of tracking this are amazing for your health. Did I mention this app is free? I tried several paid apps before settling on this one, you can't go wrong with it.

This is a calorie counter with search capability for a wide variety of foods and exercise. The app helps you keep a diary of what you eat and what you burn. It also automatically puts the food content in a daily allowance for fat, sodium, etc. for example, you enter one piece of trader joes apple tart: it will also show you how many grams of fat you have consumed today and how many you have left.

I'd been trying to lose weight for months with no success, because I didn't realize how many calories I was actually eating. Once I started using this app and logging everything I ate, I dropped 14 pounds in six weeks. I love that it tells you how much protein and carbohydrates and fat you're getting too. I will probably never stop using this app to maintain my weight! My husband was so impressed with my success that he downloaded the app and is trying to use it now too. I am blown away by how many varieties of food are in here. Even the microbrewed beer I drink! I changed absolutely nothing else about my life, I still exercise a few times a week and still eat all the same types of food I used to eat. The only thing that's changed is that I now keep within my calorie limit, which I now believe is almost impossible to do without some sort of tracking system.

This is an excellent app that keeps track daily of your food intake and exercise to help you lose weight. After you put in your initial information (starting weight, goal weight, age, etc.) it tells you how many calories, etc. you should have per day in order to lose weight and then tracks it all for you. It also tracks your daily exercise and computes how calories burned from that exercise affects your allotted daily calorie intake. After each food/meal is added to the food diary, this app will tell you how many calories, protein, carbs, fat, sodium, etc. you still have left to consume for the day before reaching your maximum suggested daily amount. It does all the calculating work for you. This app is already been so helpful in helping me to lose weight. This week alone, I've already lost three pounds!

I love love love this App!  This is the best one I've found for tracking what I eat. It has practically every food in it  you could possibly eat.  It also allows you to create the food you've eaten as well. Any and every food you log in becomes apart of your personal list that is searched first when logging new foods bcuz we tend to eat the same things frequently...how convenient is that!  It even has a tutorial and a help button...go figure!  And last but certainly not least...The nutrition button on this App is phenomenal I know what my nutrition goals are from cholesterol to sodium to fat. It literally tells you if you are over/under by identifying what you've actually used for the day. This has been a great aid in helping me to watch my cholesterol/sodium intake.   Finally. the fact that this App links to my iPhone health App is bananas!!!!!  I'm in Health App Heaven!

I have been interested in nutrition for most of my life and feel like I've been constantly aware of what I'm eating.  A friend o mine talked me in to downloading this app a year ago but it wasn't until two weeks ago that I finally decided to give it a try. I love it! Very user friendly and easy to navigate even for the first time user. I can only think of one little detail that I would like to see improved: I wish that you could edit recipes directly from your meal diary (rather than having to go back to the recipe category). Eg: I have salad practically everyday so I have a recipe for it and just tweak ratios as needed. But it's a little thing. This app has taught me how I'm really eating which has been an eye opener. And I love keeping track of my macros and vitamin/mineral intake. My sisters and I all use this now and don't foresee looking for anything else.

It's sooo helpful to have an app that keeps track of all your daily calories in such an easy way! It tracks fat, sodium, sugar, protein, and vitamins too, so I can glance and decide what kind of snack to have based on where I'm over or under for the day. The food database is massive, so I can look up nutritional information on almost any food (even from restaurants!) and instantly see if it's worth eating or not. If you can't find your food, or need to add something homemade, it's easy to add your own entry to the database. The app keeps track of your weight too, and at the end of each day, it says, "If every day were like today, you'd weigh [x amount] in 5 weeks!" This is one of my favorite features, as it's REALLY encouraging to see that your diligence is going to pay off. I've lost 13 lbs since I got this app, and I'm not stopping anytime soon. Love it!!

                      Title: Great app!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a really great app for recording both food intake and exercise! The food archive in the app includes a huge library of packaged and restaurant foods and has all information on nutrition and vitamin information. You can track your intake over days weeks and months for all vitamin and mineral intakes as well as weight loss and a few bodily measurements. You can add friends and select to make your diary visible or hidden to them as well as comment in posts they make. I use this app every day and have both lost weight and learned trends in my eating habits I hadn't noticed before including things like an iron and protein deficiency. After reviewing my eating patterns I found the types of foods that caused me to eat more or less in response to certain things and also have been motivated to eat better when I know I'll be recording what I eat. I give this app 9.5/10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app has everything. Scan in or search for your items-- most foods are already there so you don't have to type in their nutrition info. If you do happen to type it in, it is saved for future use. The diary is great because it pops up with comments about what you are eating, such as "this food is high in vitamin A," and "you have reached your iron goal for the day." There are convenient charts to help you see your progress, options for reminders to update your food journal, and even a weight projection based on your food and exercise input for the day. I love it because it calculates for you how many calories you need based on your specific goals, and also adjusts to account for extra calories burned during exercise. It even syncs with other fitness apps. So useful and I am finally getting the results I want!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app!!! To start with It's very easy to use. It has an extraordinary database and most importantly what makes it easy to use you can use any entry you made  from the same day or the previous one. I can put in my recipe and it breaks it down to how many calories I'm eating per serving. I also love their barcode scanning which allows you to input any product that's not in the database. The summary shows you the amount of vitamins , fibers you had vs the optimal goal as well as the % of carbs vs protein and vegetables you had during the day. The only this that's missing is that it does not account for the calories you burn when you exercise  and it is not reflected in you optimal weight goal. It is a great tool though to track your calories and nutrition ! simply love it ! I've recommended it to all my friends

                      Title: My Life Fitness
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To me, this app is exceptional, because I want to lose weight by monitoring calories in/calories out, but never at the expense of eliminating or reducing important nutrients, fiber, vitamins and minerals. This app counts them all up for me as I punch in what I have eaten throughout the day; then, as well as knowing how many calories I should consume for the rest of the day, I can also see if I should concentrate on having more protein, or perhaps fiber or calcium, for example, within the calories that remain. Additionally, you enter the exercise you have done that day, if any, and it figures out how many calories the exercise burns, and figures it in to your weight loss program. I am confident I will lose the amount of weight I want to with this program. And even after I reach my goal, I forsee that I will keep using this app to monitor my nutrition. It is fantastic, and I am so grateful for it!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have lost over 30 lbs. using this program and have increased my water intake from 6 to 8 cups a day just by paying attention to what I am eating and drinking. Before I used to mindlessly eat and drink and now I pay attention and enjoy my healthy and delicious food. I've rediscovered my passion for cooking and love that I can put my own recipes in and get the nutritional information right onto my diary. I don't know what I would do without the scanner feature either. This app has made it fun and easy to make a much needed lifestyle change. The only suggestion I have that would make this 100% perfect would be if there were an entry for supplements as well as the actual app tracking more than just iron, A, C and Calcium. There are so many other important vitamins and nutrients we should be monitoring. I hope this will be forthcoming.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The app works fine and the food data base is huge, just remember to hit the "search" on your keyboard because it doesn't just automatically pop up. Pretty much every food chain's menu item are there so if you eat out you can search for it. I hope that a future update allows tracking of all nutrients. Currently your limited just a few. Most are nutrients found on food labels, but what about all the good stuff in protein shakes or omega 3's? It won't track that stuff. Health app doesn't really sync well with this app and I've noticed that I'm always adjusting the calories from my workouts. Ads weren't really an issue nor crashing. The one problem I have is the "previous food item" list isn't very helpful. It suggests food that you've recently used but it's way off. Any it's a good app just needs work. I don't think this or any app can ever be perfect.

I've always tried to be healthy and make the right choices but this makes it a lot easier! I don't have to keep track of what I've eaten in my head because its all in the app. It provides breakdowns for how much of everything you have consumed including vitamins, protein, carbs, and fats so you know what you are eating too much or too little of. You can track your weight if your goal is to loose wait or you can just use it to maintain your current wait. Can even input daily activities such as walking around, vacuuming, etc. and it will tell you the calories burned. I usually input different meal options when I eat out to see what the damage will be before I order and you'd be surprised how many "healthy" options are actually terrible for you and how many 'unhealthy' options are actually not so bad. Great app overall.

This app is absolutely fantastic! I know several people who is it to keep track of their calories only - but this app allows me to keep track of all my areas of nutrition: fat, sodium, potassium, carbs, sugar, protein, iron, water intake, etc., - helps me keep a well balanced diet.... and I can also keep track of any exercise! So easy to use - has a large data base of foods - what I can't find by searching or barcode scanning I can add myself (I check other websites for the product info)! I use the "create recipe" function often to make adding my own home cooked meals easier! If I need to change any of the recipe info I can edit it from my home computer! I can not imagine dieting successfully without this awesome app! Have already introduced several friends (and even some strangers) to it! 5 Stars? I give it 10 Stars!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love keeping track of the calories I've eaten with this app. I especially love being able to flash the barcode and automatically find the food that I've eaten.  Menus for many restaurants are also available.  I don't use this app however to track my exercise. There's no way to accurately count how many calories I burned while working out. I find their averages are rather high. And also when I add an activity in, it then adds those calories back into the amount of calories I'm allowed to eat for a day. I don't necessarily want to eat more calories just because I've worked out :-). I love that this app keeps track not just of how many calories I've eaten but also the grams of fat, fiber, vitamins and minerals etc.   I told my mom about it and she uses it to. We're both hooked :-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife and I downloaded the app hoping it would help us get on the right track. We have found a lot of success with this free app. It has the most comprehensive list of food I have found and being able to see our daily intake of everything from fat to sodium to vitamins gives you a great picture of what you are consuming. We have each lost weight and a big part of that is because we can log everything down as soon as we eat it using the app and we don't underestimate or overestimate the amount of calories we are consuming. It is also good that when we exercise the app tells us how many additional calories we need to eat. The only issue I have is with strength training. They need to include calories burned during weight training. When you strength training regularly you need to eat more calories but the app doesn't take that into account.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely love this app! Total life changer! So why the one warning?? I would just warn people that use the app something they will probably figure out pretty quickly on their own if they are paying attention to the nutrition side of the app… A lot of the food that you can put into your food diary from the food database is not always correct. Easy to prove this by looking at what auto fills in My Fitness Pal… And then comparing it to the restaurant's or food product's website. For example, one entrée item had 1200 mg of sodium… But somehow on My Fitness Pal it filled in as 1.2 mg of sodium. BIG difference! So this one issue kind of reminds me of Wikipedia back in the day when people could write in information for everyone to see that wasn't always the most accurate. Hope this review was helpful! Good luck on your goals!

                      Title: Great way to lose weight!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been using this app for about 2 months to try to lose weight. I actually started with the MyPlate app about 4 months ago which is very similar. I use them both now because I can't decide which I like better. I have found that this MyFitnessPal seems to have a larger data base when scanning food. Also this app allows more fractions of serving sizes - this has 1/8 where the smallest on MyPlate is 1/4. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but when you only use a small amount and the smallest serving size you can find is 4cups that is a big deal. However, when creating your own recipe, this MyFitnessPal does not let you scan ingredients where MyPlate does. In either case, keeping track of your calories and sodium is easy and you can really lose. I also use the Fitbit Flex which is a great way to track your activity and your sleep.

It's a great app to keep track of your daily food intake. However, every time I put in a home made recipe I get total off the wall calories. I add up recipes on paper as well as on the app and The app screws up the nutritional info EVERYTIME. Sometimes it's 1/2 the amount of calories, others its 1/3, occasionally it just takes off 10-20 calories at random. If you do get this app, do not rely on actual nutritional information in the recipe section. If you don't care about micros, just do a quick add to your diary. If you want micros, just type in the ingredients straight into your diary. I love the app except for that.

This app is the best for tracking your food intake and dieting progress overall. I didn't realize how many calories, fats, and carbs I had been consuming until I started using this app. It even breaks down the nutritional content of everything you eat so you can see how much carbs, fats, protein, sodium, sugars, fiber, cholesterol, etc. you are eating. It also calculates calories burned based on your activity level. So far I have found all the foods that I've searched for listed, and I've become a lot more conscience and disciplined about what I eat. I lost 4.5 pounds the first week! I was able to do this by logging everything that I ate. I really mean it when I say, you don't know how much you are eating (over eating) until you start tracking your food consumption. I rate this app as the best! I give it 5 stars!

This app really makes tracking your calories easy. The database is extensive and easy to use, especially after you start building your database. It's fairly simple to find your previous entries in order to log daily items. Would be nice if this could be improved a bit. Areas of future improvement would be: being able to easily sync your intake with what you burn each day. I use the Lifetrak 410, which accurately tracks your caloric burn each day. It would be nice to see the burn and consumption data in one location. That way you could easily calculate the differences between the two over time, which would tell you how much weight you should be losing. Also, I really like the vitamin feature and macronutrient scale. Really cool. Could be improved by adding more vitamin data points, like b12 b6 and omega 3, etc. all in all, impressive

And, I also found that my sugar intake was too high and, I probably needed a vitamin since I couldn't seem to eat enough veggies.  And, now I can easily combine exercise and healthy eating to more successfully lose the weight I need to.

That is, when we're headed the wrong direction and need to recalibrate our calorie intake. If you use it honestly and diligently, you will loose weight! It is very convenient and has a lot of great features. The weekly calorie and progress graphs. Also the nutritional breakdown is handy. Two small complaints: 1) the nutritional breakdown doesn't include as many vitamins and minerals as it could, though it has the big ones; 2) it does not help estimate calories burned for anaerobic exercise, though this could be because it is so dependent on intensity & other individual factors. Beat calorie tracker on the market, keep up the good work!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to like the idea of this app. I have used it on and off before, but I needed something to help me start tracking my diet again. I'm trying to lower my carbohydrate intake as well as overall food intake. First off, there is no automatic calculator for net/nutritive carbs, and even though most of my carb intake right now is fiber, My Fitness Pal flags me as being over my goal for carbs. I can do the math myself, however, it's frustrating because seeing the red numbers that signal over your goal just gets old. I'm NOT over my goal, darn it! Secondly, I really, REALLY don't appreciate that strength training does not show as burning any calories. Weight training ACTUALLY burns more calories than cardio (and for a longer period of time), and maybe it's due to this that MFP doesn't want to do the math. But seriously, at least add an approximate/minimum range calories burned so that we at least have an idea of what we burned.

I am now tracking calories and know exactly what I am eating, which is best for overall weight management and health. I love that the food values are already loaded and easy to find...I have been able to find each and every food within the app so far. It has taught me to be so much more aware of what u am eating and to make better choices so I can meet my goals for each day. It also shows me what my values are for each food group and different vitamins. There are also daily articles on weight loss, exercise tips and suggestions, and even healthy recipes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife and I started losing weight by using a food journal and writing down every single thing we ate along with our daily weight. This app completely took the place of that and is even easier because of the barcode scanner/food library. It is very, very easy to use and very intuitive. I like how you can enter your workouts so that it accounts for being able to eat more calories that day. I also like that you can scan in your  daily multivitamin and it adds the values to your food to summarize your nutrient needs and deficiencies. The only negative thing that I've found is that sometimes the library's values are off a little bit from the food's package...example, frosted shredded wheat shows as 180 cals per serving but the package says 190. Not a big deal for an awesome and free app.

It makes losing weight kind of like a fun game I play on my iPhone. It's the best and easiest diet ever. I love that it tracks all my daily nutrients as well. I never realized how much sodium I was taking in and some other nutrients that I wasn't getting enough of. Using the scanner to find the foods I eat is so easy as well as just searching and adding random foods. I could go on and on about all the other features. But, all in all such a great thing. It's changing my life. Knowledge is power and I'm now easily in control. Thank you fitness pal.

I've been using the Weight Watcher app for two years and recently switched over to MFP. So far I love it. The fact that you can see exactly where you are percentage wise with sodium, carbs, sugars and other nutrition needs is awesome. I have to eat a gluten free diet, & I've been impressed with their database of foods. The only time I have to manually add something is when it's something made locally. My only complaints are: the method where you choose serving size. It would be nice if there were more options like weight or cups/Tbsp. Also, the exercise database is a bit limited, so it'd be helpful if you could manually add exercises with a time and exertion calculator. Other than those small annoyances, I HIGHLY recommend this app for anyone trying to improve their diet and exercise.

Oh, there is always someone drinking the hater-aid, especially if they lack the talents, skills, intellect and gratitude to create or be appreciative to those whom do possess the gifts to make and selflessness to share their offerings. So folks, critique and please refrain from ignorant criticism. This app is customizable and interfaces well with other apps and they are continually improving the functionality. I have lost a considerable amount of weight since my injury (I am in ab fab shape too) and this is quantifying micronutrients and assisting me to log and remain dedicated to my program for pennies on the dollar. I am grateful for my food, my health and for the invaluable assistance whom are offering help to replace the ones who just complain. Get this app and figure out how to use it for your purposes. Thanks,folks!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is the best tool you could ever have for loosing weight.  It's really quite simple.  Set your goal, log your foods, exercise and watch the weight melt away.  I never thought I could loose 35lbs, and I'm convinced it would never have happened without this fantastic and free app my wife told me about.  Like they say the best things in life are free!  I have people constantly asking me how I did it and I tell the my fitness pal is the tool they need.  I would also like to add that I lost all this weight over the winter within a 10 week period.  I'm now in a maintenance stage and just eat what I need to keep a good balance.  I'm an athlete(road cyclist) and if I loose any more I'd loose strength.  You can do this!  Get the app and get started today!  Make the decision now!

This is the first tool I have ever really kept using more than a few days. It is EASY to use. Love how fast the scanner is!  Charts my intake with all kinds of useful info. Most helpful because of the ease is that you really take stock of everything you intake. Warns you if you approach your fat intake or sodium for the day etc.  only thing I might like to see change is letting you enter with only one click. I may be operating so fast that this could be my own failing in putting any effort into figuring it out since the rest is so easy; but, sometimes I don't click at the bottom too and it doesn't store my entry. Love thus thing. Best thing I have ever used to finally pay attention to my intake of food and water. 30 days in and it is easy peasy!

                      Title: Helps me refocus
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I started using the app several years ago to lose 30 pounds. Tracking calories in and calories burned helped me to be more aware and accountable for the food choices I was making. Tracking weight loss is highly motivating as well. I've kept the weight off for several years now with minor normal seasonal fluctuations. Whenever I want to get my fitness back on track, I just log back in. Recently, for mainly ethical reasons, I decided to change my diet to a mostly vegan diet. Using MyFitnessPal has helped me to ensure that I am eating enough sources of protein and iron especially.  Being able to look at your daily nutrition on a graph and see what you need to eat in order to healthfully fuel your body BEFORE you've made mistakes has actually resulted in my being able to get fit faster with more satiation! I love this app!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The food diary that is offered in my fitness pal and is top notch. I use it for motivation to not over eat, it keeps me responsible for what I eat and when I eat. Not to mention that it cooperates with my Fitbit app. The only thing I wish it would offer, is for a higher rate of weight loss, 2 pounds a week is not enough, I'm thinking maybe double that and make it 4 pounds a week. I like that it keeps track of nutrients, and gives you daily goals for your protein, carbohydrates, sugars, sodium, to keep your dietary intake to a good level. Also it would be nice for beginners to have notifications that if their diet is higher in sodium, to let them know to take/get electrolytes.I have not had experience with the paid version, that may be offered in it.

I've been using this app religiously for months now. It has a huge index of foods to search, and also their nutritional breakdown. This really helped me become aware of the vitamins and nutrients I'm not getting enough of each day (calcium!). It also breaks down your food logged for the day into a percentage of fat, carbs, and protein. Of course everything isn't going to be exact, but this is a really useful tool whether you're trying to lose, gain, or maintain. The app includes weight progress and graphical representations of your weight over time, and also of your week calorically so you can see how well you're doing. You can connect with friends using the app to help stay on track as well. This app has helped me stick to my caloric goals and is a very useful tool!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am very thankful for having this app. It's helped me lose 35 pounds over a three-month period. Of course, you have to be disciplined in entering exactly what you eat on the application. At first, it is difficult - sometimes you try to underestimate the amount of calories you consume. You shouldn't do this, instead, use the app to enter everything you eat honestly, and over time, you will realize your specific eating patterns and habits and then you can make a sustained change in the way that you eat. I didn't use any specific diet to lose the weight, I just started to teach myself to eat in moderation. I have kept the 35 pounds off now without doing anything for almost 4 months now :) hope this helps! Thanks for the great app!

This app is amazing, probably the best app I've ever bought. I don't remember the last time I reviewed a product, but this app needs to be more popular. It's as easy as adding what you eat, simply search it in the bar and chances are it's already there. It sets a calorie goal based off of how much you weigh, your age, your height, if you want to gain weight, lose weight, or maintain, and how fast you want to lose it. It shows you if you are getting enough vitamins and iron and everything in between. You enter your weight whenever you want, and it shows charts showing your progress. This is just a few things this genius app does. I've only had it two weeks and I've lost 4 pounds. It's addicting and motivating, and definitely worth paying for!

Impressive number of food and restaurant brands accounted for in the calorie count database. Keeping track of calories this way relieves stress because you always know where you stand.  Went to movies last night and knew I had 500 calories to stay within my limit. Allowed me to enjoy a stress free treat. Also helps with saying no at the end of the day when seeing exactly how much you've consumed already. Also keeps track of other nutrition estimates like sodium and cholesterol.  Down sided are that it doesn't adjust for when food is eaten.  A bowl of pasta a night is worse than that same bowl for lunch.  Some of the calorie estimates conflict with each other.  Bottom line it has worked for me because I like keeping score and meeting daily goals.

I've been using this app for well over a year. I always wait a while before reviewing so I have time to really use it. So I can honestly say I love it! I love the ability to scan the label and quickly add the item to my diary. I also have to say that there has never been any food item that I couldn't find on their database. This has been a great tool for keeping track of calories. It also keeps track of a few other components (protein, fat, carbs, a few vitamins) as well. That is very helpful. There is also the exercise database. It will calculate the number of calories you burn for certain activities for whatever time you enter. I'm not sure about the accuracy, it may overestimate, so I just enter fewer minutes just to be safe. But best of all, it's free!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a fantastic app - it is easy to use, has lots of motivating features and really allows me to keep track of my eating and exercise. The food entry is really straightforward - virtually everything I've searched for is in the system or can be found by scanning its barcode. When you enter a food or scan its barcode, all of the nutritional information is entered and you get a report at the end of the day showing your fat, protein and carbs as well as sodium, various vitamins etc. This app also allows you to share your journey with someone else - I haven't used this feature but think it would be really helpful. When I downloaded this app I also downloaded a few other diet/fitness apps but this is the only one I've continued to use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is the perfect calorie counter, weight tracker, exercise tracker, even water intake tracker I've ever seen. It calculates your target calories per day based on your current weight, age and goals, and keeps you on course. Has thousands of foods in the database, and you can scan barcodes and manually add foods too. Best part is it ALSO keeps track of your full daily nutrition, not just calories, so you get a picture of not just how much you're eating but what you're eating, so you can curb foods with too much sugar or cholesterol or add a multivitamin if you're not getting enough. Everyone everywhere should use this app, whether they're trying to lose weight or not, because it really opens your eyes to what you're putting in your body every day.

I love this app. There's such a massive database that it pulls from that I hardly ever consume a food that they don't have the data for! The only thing I wish they would add are time stamps for your food entries so you know that a snack you had in the morning was after breakfast and before lunch and that your other snack was after dinner. Time stamps would be much appreciated. Also, if you were to learn from our data and then recommend the amount of calories we eat for breakfast based off what we normally do or what goal we have set and the same for lunch dinner or snacks. You could even recommend what sorts of foods when recommending the amount of calories so that we hit our vitamin, protein, carb, fiber, etc. goals.

The free version essentially offers the ability to track the data a user needs to succeed. My physician recommends to his patients, and I've used for several years to track my nutritional intake. The app currently DOES NOT OFFER the option to set or track micronutrients..folate, folic acid, vitamin D, amino acids... These nutrients are critical, especially to women who are pregnant and those with nutrition-related illness. The premium version, offered at cost, doesn't offer the option to set or track micronutrients, either. In fact, I determined that there is no cost/benefit value to the premium version. I canceled my Premium subscription within the first month. Despite this, I recommend this app and hope the developer adds an update to include micronutrients.

Another this it tells me when I eat something high in sodium! I keep in touch with what my friends and family eat and their weight loss journey! The one thing I don't like (which is why I gave 3 stars) is that it gives you calories to eat after workouts. I feel like that should be an option to put on their. I've heard many people say well if I work out I get more calories so they go to the gym (+) but then go eat those given calories(-). All around I love this app! I use it everyday and I tell all my co-workers, friends, and family! I recently got one of my clients and her whole family hooked on MyFitnessPal!

I'm leaner and can keep up on my training without feeling run down because I wasn't eating enough. The ability to add in exercise is great. I have to estimate a bit since my exercise is not accurately listed, but the number of options are quite good. I wish there were more vitamins and minerals listed in the nutrient summary, but they at least have the major ones. I love the pie chart breakdown of carbs-fats-proteins. The visual representations make the nutritional values of my diet so clear. It also helped me to seek out more information on nutrition and now I can use this app even more effectively. Overall a truly wonderful aid to anyone concerned with what goes into their body.

I like to keep track of sodium and fiber as well as other nutrients and that information is available as well. The app is very easy to use. I especially love using the barcode option to get the caloric and nutrient values of foods I get from the grocery store. I also like the ability to import recipes from the web. Since the app syncs with multiple fitness and exercise apps, it is also easy to keep track of exercises and their caloric expenditures. This encourages you to do daily exercises. I haven't felt this healthy in years and my husband is now using this app as well.

This app was recommended by a friend after he lost 11lbs. As a lifelong watcher of my weight (without consistent results) I did the download and am extremely happy with the results. A very up to date food and restaurant menu database makes keeping track of your calories and nutritional levels a breeze.  Setting up your weight loss goal could not be easier. Setting your current weight and how many pounds you wish to lose a week over a given period of time will get you the maximum caloric intake  you can have each day. Plus, the app links your steps and other exercise so you can indulge in a few extra calories if you wish without sacrificing your weight loss goal. Give this app a try you will not be disappointed!

I use this app the keep track of my calorie intake and expenditure. Also to monitor my sodium, fats, and vitamins/minerals I get from foods/drinks. This app is easy to use, easy to read, and all around very helpful. I didn't give it 5stars for two reasons; the first being that Strength exercises do not count toward calorie expenditure. I know I break a sweat when I spend 30-45 minutes doing push-ups, crunches, leg lifts, etc. So I will usually add that I did Calisthenics for that amount of time to get the calorie output. May it not be correct and that is annoying. The second reason is that I would prefer the pie graph to be split between simple carbs & complex carbs. It would be nice to know what percentage of my diet of carbs is crackers or beans and what percentage is spinach or carrots etc. Besides those two things great app & very helpful.

You can use all of that, some of it, or even just cals if you want. There is a large database of foods online. The barcode scanner on the app is great. And once you manually enter a food's info in, it's extremely easy to recall for future days. You can edit everything through the app, except past measurements; past measurements is the only thing you need to log online for. Lastly, it helps tracks either weight, neckline, waist, or hips. Has a lot of options and you can use some, all, or almost none of them! Very easy to use and very customizable!

I have use several Nutrition databases and calories trackers in the past and haven't  lasted with them for more than 2 days. Often I would search for an product or even a simple ingredient, an it would not showed the frickin thing. It got frustrated and I said screw it. MyFitnessPal is very convenient to use and I love quick use of the calorie and other nutrients tracker as I add and go. Albeit, they have been product and ingredients that have been hard to find. Also, I would love in MyFitnessPal would show more of a comprehensive breakdown of the nutrients consumed, such as more vitamins and minerals, soluble an insoluble fiber, etc., whether it be on this app or the website itself. Regardless, This app has been a useful tool on tracking my calories and helping lose weight.

I hated that I gained 12 pounds over the summer and every week my pants got tighter in the fall. Finally, I found this app and started eating healthier food and keeping track of it! I love it because I don't just track calories, I track meals and protein, carbs, sugars, fats and some vitamins too!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

My cousin inspired me to try this app as she's lost quite a bit of weight on it. I've used Lose It before but once I learned the ins and outs of this one I like it better. It has more specific measuring options and seems to already have a significant amount of nutritional info already stored.  The app rewards you for meeting its prescribed goals and sends you warnings when u get close to limits. The nutritional pie graph helps me know what food choices I need to make as the day goes on--like if I'm short on potassium or vitamin A I might throw a sweet potato in the oven, etc. I also like the feature that tells me how much I'll weigh eventually if "every day were like today." Fun and very helpful app---if only there were something as easy for my budget . . .

I've only used one other tracking app but this one is much better.  You track your meals (and it has every food  already built in), you can post status updates for friends on the app, and it has encouraging things that pop up... Like when you've logged on several days in a row, or if you've lost weight, or if you stayed under your calorie count for the day.  Or when you log a food, it may tell you it's good for fiber, or vitamin c, Etc.  I really like the encouragement and having my friends on there to "like" my wins and help me through the losses.  It also has blogs and recipes you can check out.  Oh, and one more thing... It has exercise built in that you can calculate.  Even cleaning the house can count. :)

                      Title: Fast, easy way to track your intake
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I always thought it would be too hard to count calories, but this app makes it really easy! Just enter what you ate (e.g. 1 medium apple) and the app tracks your calories, sugar, carbs, fats, vitamins, and more. For packaged foods, just scan the barcode and enter the amount consumed (e.g. 1 cup). I can't believe how many foods are in the database! It seems like it recognizes everything. I've learned a lot about what I'm really eating (so many of my previous estimates were wrong). It's helped me make good decisions and helped me be sure I don't exceed the calorie counts I want. Before I had the app, I just couldn't seem to lose a single pound for weeks. Now, I feel totally in control, and I'm finally and steadily losing weight!

I really like this app. It has a few faults though. I think it needs sometime to remind you of your different goal weights. I also think that the app should have some kind of thing to congratulate you when you lose weight besides just the thing that says "so and so lost x weight!" I also think that it would be nice if you could edit the recipes you already have for mistakes and such and that you could put in the exact amount of whatever your recipe is. Other than that its pretty go. I really like the barcode scanner too. It's very useful in a pinch. Although I'd really like to see something for women to factor in their period. This app is very complete and has everything you could love about a calorie counting app. I mostly really like this app!

Weight watchers recently changed their weight loss plan. The basic program is still good and the meetings are worth my time.  But the new points plus program allows me to eat so much food that I cannot lose weight. I have 5 pounds to lose before I am once again at my goal weight. I need an online way to track my food intake that  allows me to lose weight. I cant use the weight watcher online tracking anymore because the new points plus system doesn't work for me. Myfitnesspay is a very good way to track your food intake and lose weight. so far the sites recommendations for calories have enabled me to lose weight. I like the way the site breaks down food into calories, fat, protein, sugar, sodium and carbs.

I've been using this app for exactly 175 days and I set my goal to lose 2lbs a week and I've met and exceeded that goal. In 175 days I have lost 41lbs and it was definitely with the help of this app. I was one of those people who didn't want to keep up with counting calories and journaling everything I ate but this app has totally changed my thought process. It's very easy and convenient to log everything you eat and keep up with your calorie intake, the amount of protein, carbs, fats and vitamins your body needs. If being healthy and in shape is your goal then I would certainly recommend this app. Heck, I've already been spreading the word about it because I'm always in the gym constantly telling people about it. TRY IT!!!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been using this app for 3 1/2 months & find it very helpful. I like being able to input the ingredients of my own recipes & have it tell me how many calories each serving is but when I make a meal, such as a casserole or stew which has multiple servings, I first have to measure the serving size & then how many servings there is in total before letting the family eat, & by that time it is cold. Another frustrating thing for me is having the media comments pop up first when I just want to add calories. Right now I'm not concerned with staying within its limits of protein, fat, vitamins, etc, I'm just recording calories, but I'm sure it will come in handy later. Even so, with only counting calories & trying to stay under my limit, I have lost over 30 lbs!

I switched to this app from Weight Watchers Online. Not because of any specific problems in Weight Watchers, just because of the depth of information in this app, combined with its ease of use. With this app, I am able to not only track an overall eating budget, but I am also able to easily see totals for potassium, sodium, sugar, etc. Much of this was masked by a points system that  was designed to keep things simple. Coupling this app to Endomondo means that my workouts appear automatically. I had to enter them manually in Weight Watchers AFTER converting to points. I find that with the ease of seeing so much more information, I am making much better food choices throughout the day.

Absolute best, easiest to use and most effective weight loss app EVER! The weekly summary and average graph is the best tool because it shows you that even if you went over your calorie on one or even a few days you can stay on track for the week! Two other FREE features that are really great is the barcode scanner (which I had to pay for on my last app) and the nutritional break-down such as sodium and vitamins (which required a subscription on the other app I used). MyFitnessPal also let's you input your own homemade recipes to determine the caloric and nutritional value of a serving! This is the only app I know of that gives you this much control! Download and use it everyday, you won't regret it!

I love the ability to log what I eat in order to keep track of my nutrition intake. I had Gastric Bypass surgery 4 years ago and lost all but the last 25 pounds to my ultimate goal. I'm working toward losing that now, but there is no option for those of us who have had this type of surgery. Even our maintenance calories are below the "recommended" amount per day, and it penalizes you by not recording your achievements or guiding your weight loss goals. A section for vitamins and supplements would also be helpful. Most people I know take vitamins and other supplements. Mine total 98 calories per day! Having them in one place would allow for an easy entry day after day.

I also get motivated to work out when I log all my food for the day and see that I am over my limit. I've been using this for two weeks and haven't found a food that wasn't on the list, including restaurants.  This is very similar to the WW app which I have used in the past only it's free and there are no cryptic points. It shows you all the nutritional information, sodium, vitamins, fats, fiber, calories and more. This app also has a social media section where you can friend others and build a support network for your fitness/weight loss goals.  Thank you!

This app is absolutely wonderful! I can create a profile and plan based on my personal goals. It's very easy to use. To record nutrition facts, you can scan barcodes of items, search for them, and even save recipes of often eaten foods with all the nutrition facts saved. The app also takes into account your exercise and water intake. Also, the app can be used to help lose, gain, or maintain weight. I've been using the app for about 9 months now to maintain my weight. It has definitely helped me eat healthier and smarter, as it not only records calories, but also fat, carbs, vitamins, minerals, and protein. (Basically everything found on a nutrition facts label) This app went beyond my expectations! Love it!

I love this app; I've used it daily and lost 30 pounds so far. It seems to have anything I might possibly eat in its database, and I use the daily summary to make sure I get enough calcium, fiber, etc. the only disappointment is that it's impossible to edit a recipe. I'm a serious cook, and I use the feature a lot; if I make a mistake or hit "save" accidentally before I'm done entering a recipe, there is no way to get back in and make a change. Sometimes, if something is too caloric I'd like to be able to play with it a little, swap out something for another ingredient with fewer calories, and I can't do that. Mostly, though, this is an incredibly useful, easy-to-use tool for weight loss.

I had never counted calories until I was serious about losing weight. This app is great. The multi add feature is awesome once you get the hang of it. This exceeded my expectations! There are a lot of fast food items already calculated for you. This has helped me realize what I had been in taking before my diet and helps me keep track of what I eat now so I don't have to try and remember later how many calories I have available. Love the break down of which vitamins, fats, etc I have had for the day. It helps me choose my meals more wisely to try and get at least the average daily allowance. My husband and I can cheer each other on, or you can go more public and share it on Facebook.

I have only been using this app for about 10 days. I had been using calorie count for several years. This has been a surprisingly easy change over. I love the way it automatically keeps foods you use often. It lets you make meals that you eat often. I was also able to put in a recipe that I had altered to get the correct calories. The only thing I miss is the ability to change the grams to get the exact calories. I also use a Fitbit and they work together perfectly. I didn't have that with calorie count, so this is much better. It also doesn't track things like potassium and other vitamins minerals like calorie count. Over all I am very satisfied with this app and would recommend it.

We've been using this app for almost 4 months, and it has helped us lose weight and eat healthier. My husband can now see how sodium adds up fast in prepared food and how it affects weight loss ( or, why it's not coming off).  We especially like being able to copy each other's meals to our own diaries, which is a real timesaver. The only thing I'd like to see them do is make the food database available without having to click "add" to the diary, first; it would be nice to be able to look different foods' values up first, then decide what to have and add your final choice to the diary. I also prefer using the app on my iPad - more real estate and easier to use - but the phone app is convenient when away from home.

I've been using this app for months and it is the first tool I've ever found that made it super easy to track my nutritional intake and activity levels in a manner that keeps me on track, honest, and feeling positive and healthy instead of deprived and on a punitive diet. Although I have a severe hypothyroiditis and other chronic health challenges, I've managed to steadily lose weight at a maintainable pace (15 pounds in two months with 45 to go) and steadily increase my cardiovascular activities painlessly. I especially like how quickly and easily I can check whether I  have met my daily goals for vitamin, calcium, sodium, and carb intake and exercise level and then find foods and activities that will bring me to goal.

This app tracks all foods easily either via barcode scanner, or inputting the name of the food you're eating. If it's a verified food with all the nutrients and calories deemed accurate, it puts a little green Arrow next to the description so you know you are getting accurate information. It also syncs with my Fitbit including my aria scale and sometimes more quickly than my Fitbit app syncs the information. Plus I am on a quest to make sure I get sufficient calcium in my diet, and this app has a nutrition tab that lets me track most nutrients including calcium. I believe the premium app has more options but this one is sufficient for my needs right now. Good app!

This aspect is very encouraging. I've been using this for a week - since the holiday "break" I took, and I've lost 4 pounds this week!!

Although I already exercise and know how to eat right, I find it very hard to get to my happy weight now that I am in my 40's. This app has helped me become conscious of what I am putting in my mouth and has helped eliminated the mindless snacking. It makes me think twice before popping that piece of cheese or cracker in because I know I will have to enter it in my food diary. The only thing I wish it did (maybe it does and just haven't found it) is keep track of sugar, fat and sodium intake because while calories in definitely matter, the type of calories matter just as much.

This is the best app to help with weight loss and muscle gain. It has millions of food items and you can even access most restaurants menus if your location is turned on. The best part is being able to enter how quickly you want to lose weight along with your current measurements. Nothing crazy, just height, weight, gender. The nutrition guide is super helpful for letting you know how much sugar, carbs, protein, fat, sodium, etc. you have taken in for the day. Logging your exercise keeps you motivated. It is impossible to lose fat if you're not aware of how many calories you consume. I recommend this app to everyone. It helped me kick start my lifestyle/fitness journey.

                      Title: Works well for me
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app has done wonders for me. It has proved very useful in simply getting me to consider and catalogue my calorie intake and activity levels. Instead of being a detriment , I consider the wealth of brand name foods and restaurant meals a bonus. The fact that it breaks down the components of my diet ( carbs, sodium , fat etcetera ) is also extremely beneficial. The concerns of privacy are valid if you accept all defaults but you can opt in or out of many of the " intrusive " features. If you want to share beyond your email address , give them your friends names so they can track, possibly support you. If not keep your info to your self and learn what you are consuming daily, weekly monthly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I commute and eat out often.  This is the first time that I've been able to know how many grams of fat I need in a day or how much protein or sodium. There are a million calorie combinations.  For example, how many calories in a Taco Bell bean burrito without red sauce and onions and with cheese.  It knows this!  Or how many nutrients are in an Equate chewable multivitamin.  How fantastic is that?  Now I can research what I want to eat before I eat it and make the best choices.  The exercise portion allows you to manually enter the number of calories, incline and speed based on your treadmill's data.  Or you can use the data in the app.  You can set reminders to yourself so you don't forget to log in your meals.  This is a great app!

I only wanted to loose about five pounds. I've used WW and the fitbit apps and was happy with both. But I LOVE the database in myfitnesspal. I eat odd food from all over the world and haven't found anything yet that wasn't in the database. More than that, though, myfitnesspal is helping me makeuch better decisions about what to eat, not just how much, like the other programs. Balancing fat-protien-carbs alone is good, but with the vitamin info too I'm really making better choices regarding what snacks to eat and what to have for dinner. I've also realized there is no way I can get enough calcium without supplements so I've added that. I'm really happy with this app and recommend it highly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I've used this app for three years and it has been an essential part of my healthy lifestyle (lost 60+ pounds in the past year). When I use this app, I lose weight. Period. That said, the quality of this app has steadily declined since becoming affiliated with Under Armor, as has my other favorite fitness app, MapMyFitness. Syncing is much less reliable (slower) between apps and many elements feel like they have been changed, either for the sake of change, or perhaps to encourage you to pay for the upgrade. I'd be glad to pay for this app, as it has been absolutely invaluable to me, but the the current trajectory of features and performance does not inspire confidence in its long-term usability.

I am a triathlete who has never had to worry about my weight. But in hit my late 40's and i couldnt get rif of the tire around my waist. So i tried this app and i am hooked! I easily lost the weight and found helpful information about my protein and sodium intake. This is an indispensible training tool. I recommend it to everyone I know. As a nurse I think it has great health benefits. I was very pleased with the large assortment of exercises and the scan option for food! The only improvement tht would help athletes, but I dont know if its possible) is if it could adjust sodium and potassium level to account those lost by exercise? I also love the daily summary and projected weight- that is a real motivator.

Been using this app for about 2 months every single day. If you pair this with a small kitchen scale and weigh some key ingredients like sauces, oils, meats, carbs you can really learn what an appropriate meal is. Also if you use the scanner function on any prepared foods at the end of the day take a look at the nutrition breakdown and you will be aghast at how much sodium you take in.

This is one of the best apps I have ever gotten, period! It is an invaluable tool in the pursuit of goal oriented eating. I say goal oriented because it's not just an app for those wanting to lose weight, it's for those wanting to gain, or just maintain as well. It makes hitting my macro count everyday a piece of cake. There is an unbelievable data base of foods in this app. You can search for almost anything (or use the barcode scan feature) and the nutrition information is in there! It really has too many cool ways to use it to list here. Download it and check it out while it's still free. I can't believe an app this great will remain free forever...I'd be willing to pay for it!

I have not been using this app very long and have been very pleased with it. It was recommended to me by a health nurse that I needed to talk with for insurance. It was then recommended to me again by a doctor that I work with. I know now why they recommend it. Very, very easy to use. Most of what I scan in already in the database. Search engine is not picky at all which makes typing something in easy. I was on a low carb diet before getting this app and it should be of value no matter what diet your on. Helps me keep track of carbs, sodium, and vitamins. I take two different brands of vitamins and they are both scannable. I do hope they add more categories to track vitamins.

This is a pretty comprehensive look at not just calories, but sodium, fats, carbs, etc. I don't clock in every day, but when I'm about to eat that tempting meal from my favorite restaurant, I get a little reminder that I might want a healthier option. Love all the exercise, foods, and even supplements that are available to choose from. You can even create your own meals if there isn't an option to choose from; granted it may take a little time and some conversion to get the meal down just right, but once you create it, it's there for good! It promotes accountability and motivation not only for yourself, but invite friends as well! Way to go MyFitness!

Very easy to use and love how you can track your diet/nutrition on a daily basis. My only complaints are that it only tracks a few of the vitamins and minerals with no ability to add or track more. The other thing, which I suspect is true for many other apps like this one, is that some of the nutritional info upon searching for food items can seem pretty far off from reality. You find yourself looking up several of the results just to cross check the numbers. That being said, the mobile app strangely, is better than the website as it allows you to track percentages of all the various items (protein, fat, vitamins, etc). while you can't do this on the website.

I love how much this app has to offer. I can keep track of my calories and my workouts. It syncs up with my fitbit. It also lets you track nutrients as well, which I love! If you plateau or see you're not losing as much as you should be, you can check out the nutrient breakdown and see if maybe you overdid it on the fat, sugar, sodium, or whatever else that could explain the difference. For example, I did not realize just how much sugar I consume daily from a seemingly healthy source: Greek yogurt.

I really like this app for tracking my calories and also the nutritional information of the food I am eating. As a vegetarian, it has helped me realize that I needed to be aware of the protein I was lacking in my diet and I have made adjustments to improve that part of my daily diet. I was also consuming way more sodium than I should have been so I have more careful of that as well. Overall I am very happy with it. My only complaint is that sometimes I have trouble getting my information to link with my Garmin connect app that I use with my vivofit. I don't know if the problem is with Garmin or Fitness Pal, but it does work most of the time. So that's why I gave only 4 stars. But really a great app, especially since it is free.

I can't say enough good things about this app! It's easy to use, has tons of info and it's free!! If you really want to lose weight or just get in shape it's perfect. Its kept me on track now for 3 weeks which is longer than I've ever been able to really stick with any fitness plan. The only thing you need to be careful with is that not all nutritional info for all items is accurately reported. So if you need to specifically watch things like sodium or cholesterol intake just make sure you take the time to enter specific info for the items you eat the most.  The only thing I really wish the app had was a barcode scanner for things like protein bars and snack packs.

I love this app. I have been using it on a daily basis and been loosing weight. What I love about it, is that it not only keeps track of your calories but it also keeps track of how much fat, carbs, protein, sugar, sodium, potassium, fiber, and cholesterol and vitamins. Usually I like to balance my diet with about 55% carbs, 30% protein and 15% fat and before use to have to pull out a pen and paper to do the math to figure out my balance. Now, with this app it automatically provides a pie chart and tells you what your diet balance, that there alone has made life easier. All you need is dedication to this app and a real desire to lose weight and your guaranteed success. And this app is free, that's the best part.

The list of different foods is pretty much endless , anything you could possibly eat its there! My favorite part of the app would have to be at the end when complete an entry, the app tells you what  your estimated weight would be in 5 weeks time, if you stuck the same eating/exercise routine done on that day!

This application is very useful and it will even tell you how much weight you will loose based on your eating habits and will include what exercising routine you are doing. The only thing that I would like to see, is the percentage on your specific intakes. For example, how much more fruits, vegetables, vitamins, protein you would have to eat based on your daily intake and your specific daily calorie intake.

You can also log your weight daily and it shows you your weight progress on a visual graph that is very helpful. One bug that I have a problem with is connection. Too often it'll tell me I'm not connected to the internet, when I am, and so the food search or the barcode function refuse to work. I always have to quit the app and then reopen it to get it to register that I'm connected and sometimes that doesn't even work.

I am trying to lose weight, and also need to watch my cholesterol and sodium. This app provides a report screen that shows me cholesterol and sodium intake, as well as calories, protein, carbs, etc., so it's really helpful in those regards. The database of foods is crowd-sourced so I have found most of the packaged foods I eat—even some unusual ones that I wasn't expecting to be in there (e.g., some international holiday foods from World Market). Another benefit is that you can use the web site to enter and view your food/exercise too. You can also enter calories only if you don't know the exact details of what you have eaten (like that piece of birthday cake I had at the office.)

Over a period of one year, I have lost 95 pounds and have kept it off ever since, using My Fitness Pal!  Entering in my daily meals became a routine for me.  Every time I would eat, I'd be conscious of the calories and nutrition in the food I'd consume.  My Fitness Pal is awesome because once I set a goal weight, I was constantly working toward that weight.  I also lost the weight in a steady, healthy way, instead of too quickly, because of My Fitness Pal.  I love that this app has nutritional information for thousands of foods and almost every restaurant I've been!  The app is also very easy to use!  Thank you, My Fitness Pal, for helping me get back to the real me!

I love that it syncs with their servers, they have an app for both my phone and iPad, and that it shows you percentage of carbs, fat, and protein. Then if you want more details, you can exactly how much of them you had and how much of any micronutrient. Loving this app. The only thing I wish it had is a reminder system like livestrong has to remind you to track your daily activities and food.

I have been using this app for three days and I haven't had a single problem with it.

I love that it has my progress graphed, that it calculates my intake of nutrients such as calcium, and that it lets me know if I have reached or exceeded my daily goals. When signing up, you can enter the amount of weight you would like to lose or gain and it tells you how many calories per day would be ideal for the situation. This is a must have! Now I just have to stay motivated enough to use it...

There had been an update that day (4/6/16). I turned off background app activity but the problem still wasn't solved. My battery was dying and my phone was warm and I hadn't even opened the app! I deleted it completely and everything immediately got better. Phone stayed alive at 7% battery for hours. I have the app on my iPad too and that version seems fine. I also have an Apple Watch so maybe there's a connection? Anyway, I won't. Be reinstalling until this gets fixed, which is too bad.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I camelback to MyFitness Pal when I got serious about losing weight.  It has a great database of foods and you can use the scan feature for foods in your pantry and fridge. This app helps you to get real with your food intake. I also like the improvement to the servings indicator do you can change it to what you ate not the standard portion.   It has reminders so you can remind yourself to update your meals!  I lost 2.5 lbs the first week on a 1500 calorie program. It's a great way to change habits.  I even recognized that I needed to eat different foods to increase my vitamin intake.  Amazing!  Needs more work on the exercise functionality. I love this app!!

This app is supportive in coaching you on calorie intake as well as fats and sodium. Let's you know when you are on track or if you are off track to your goals. It tells me by my food log, if I eat this way I will weigh XYZ in 5 weeks. PLUS I stay connected with my support group daily in their tracking and reporting too. BONUS, it's all FREE! As a family we all loaded this app now "together" from all over the USA we stay connected as if we worked out together. We love this app. You may find it addicting! Really :-)

This app has changed my life! I Am a power lifter that had never paid as much attention to nutrition and just wanted to stay big. Now I stay big the right way this has helped me realize I do not need so much sodium in my diet and that I was exceeding the needs of my body before! I highly recommend this to everyone even if they are not on a diet or involved in athletics of some sort. It should be a law in the United States that every American has myfitnesspal either online or on their phone. Our country would be full of healthier people with longer life expectancies and physiques that are MUCH easier on the eyes. Thank You myfitnesspal!

                      Title: Consistent but resistant to change
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app- it's accurate and reliable. Biggest issue I have with it is that you can't delete foods from here or the website easily. I have a set of foods I eat all the time but I don't always eat out or eat a cupcake or fancy latte or whatever every day so when I put a one-time  food on here, it stays on the list forever. So I end up adding quick calories which doesn't give me the benefit of knowing how much fat, sugar, protein, sodium, carbs etc that I have had. I've seen things I tried over a year ago on here and that's really annoying. If they had a "one-time foods" category or made it easier to delete them, I would give this app all five stars. But the absence of a seemingly very critical feature is a three-star annoyance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I like this app a lot. You can find almost any food in the database and you have the option of scanning barcodes to pull up foods instead of the manual search function. (I've had better luck through searching, though.) The food information that they provide is basically the nutrition label you'd find on the back of a packaged food item. So it confuses me why we can't pull our total nutrition information together! It looks to me that you can only tally your calories. (Probably following the mantra of Calories in-Calories out). But nutrient information is so important! How much saturated fat? Vitamins? Fiber? Etc. I would give the app 10 stars if it could incorporate that info!!

I've competed in one physique show using this app and took a close second place.  This app is set up very user friendly and has plenty of information for you to track and monitor.  Even if I forget to put something in this app is a great way for me to be accountable for what I eat and how often.  It keeps track of macro nutrients which many fitness enthusiasts are becoming more and more aware of as well as vitamins.  Overall, a great app for anyone looking to live a healthier lifestyle.

I started my fitness pal as a way to just inventory what I was putting in my mouth. I have now added a fitbit to not only watch my sleeping, but I use it to monitor calories burned. I've even taken it further and started looking at the nutrition per day to better balance what I need to eat. I've even supplemented my diet with vitamins to closely reach my daily recommended intake This is a way to diet because I deny myself nothing. When I reach my calorie count I am done for the day. The trick is to do this for the long haul. I've done this for 8 months and lost 35 lbs., 1/2 pounds per week. That way it stays off. Great app that gives you information to diet effectively.

I am learning SO much about food: what I consider food, what processing does to food, and what my body needs. This app is so convenient to use, love the barcode option!!! Now I ALWAYS know what I'm putting into my body (sugars, fats, sodium - which is a lot more important to weight loss than you'd think!!!-, and protein), no more excuses!!! All of this is amazing in not only helping me lose weight, which I have been CONSISTENTLY, but also in increasing my nutrient content per calories! Love love LOVE this app, it changed my life!!!

This is an amazing app. I learned so much about my eating habit, and at the same time lost 20lbs in the process. The only issue I have with this app is that I feel that the workout section is not as comprehensive as other apps out there, I find myself having to supplement this app with Nikefit or Epic workout.  Specially, since it's cardio section calculates your calories, and at time is not exact.  For example it estimates an elliptical workout but does not account for the distance or level you workout at, only the time spent.  Other than that, this app is great.  It is the best app for those trying to diet, and learn what Vitamin each type of food has.

This is such an easy way to track all your nutrition facts & exercise!  I have had to track calories &/or fat & carbs & protein, etc. But with this it shows even more figures. For example I had no idea how much sodium is in almost everything!  It really helps me to see what I'm putting in my body. AND, I treat it as a sort of game. I love playing computer games, so someone told me once to pretend it's like a game. That helps. So easy to include each thing you eat. The barcode app is amazing!  I really like how it will tell me I haven't recorded my breakfast or whatever meal & asks if I want to do that. It even tells me when to weigh! Love it.

It has done a good job of making us aware of what we are eating and not eating and realizing areas we need to cut back or add.  We like the fact it ties in with our activity tracking device too.  There Re a few things I would like to see fixed, including the ability to track more vitamins and minerals (like B vitamins, etc.) and customize what nutrients appear in my reports and diary ... It currently limits it to the boilerplate nutrients.  I'd also like to track net carbs.  All-in-all it's been fun and educational keeping track of our daily food and this has helped to keep us on track with our diet!

This app is fantastic. I've been overweight for as long as I can remember, and I have tried literally everything to lose weight without success. This app allows you to easily keep track of your calories (as well as fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbs, etc) and your exercise to meet a net calorie goal for the day. In one month I have lost 14 pounds and kept it off, I feel great, and I have more energy. The app will also encourage you when you log your weight and will tell you based on your daily "diary" how much your projected weight loss in 5 weeks is based on that day. Definitely recommended, I'm living proof it works!

I have started taking a daily vitamin due to the low iron and calcium in my diet.  I also thought I didn't eat that much sugar but was high on carbs but found out the exact opposite was true. Now I know where I need to make my diet changes and I've started to see results that exercise alone wasn't giving me!!!

Thank you so much for creating this app! I've been using it for over 3 years now. I've gone from 260lbs non active person to a 190lb amateur bodybuilder. So I cannot thank you guys enough for developing an app that has changed my life. So I used to use the ability to change each macro by gram on the web application. I really think you guys need to bring this to the app version, for free. $50 a year is a tremendous amount to pay to simply  change a few numbers in my opinion. I think it would also be an incredible addition to be able to switch from full macro/micronutrient view to just a macro view. Once again this is not to detract from the amazing work you guys have done. Thank you for hearing me out.

Thanks for a really great app. Oh, I almost forgot Tom mention, when I exercise with my Runtastic Pro app, it automatically inputs my exercise and calories burned. Of course I had to set that up initially, but it's so easy now. Thanks again!.

The ONLY thing I don't like about it is the fitness log doesn't or at least I can't figure out how to get it to track weight lifting. It allows you to input sets/reps with weight used, but didn't credit me any calories burned, AND I would rather just input that I lifted free weights for 45 minutes for 450 calories burned or whatever that amounts to than log each set. I don't have time for that, but I still find this app VERY valuable. To see how much protein, fat, carbs fiber, vitamins etc I took in for the day is AWESOME!

I've used this app on and off over the years, and often ended up feeling like it was too much work to enter everything manually. They've really made improvements over the years, and you get so much helpful data now that it's a no brainer to use. Not only can I track calories and set goals, but I can see where I'm eating the most calories (what foods and meals), how I'm doing with nutrition goals (fat, vitamins, cholesterol, etc), and what my projected weight would be. This is a really effective tool whether you want to gain, lose, maintain weight, or just track your nutrition.

This has been a wonderful app very easy to keep track of what you're eating and calorie intake. For me it helped me keep track of what I was putting in my body down to my vitamins. Only drawback is they do the water in cups you can't choose ounces and can't set a water goal for the day. Also can be a little hard to add custom dishes because you can't scan in that setting and some things you may add to a dish may be scannable I am on the free version and do not know what for sure is available on the paid one but do not want another monthly expense just so I can know what foods are high in certain nutrients.. Like we can google that stuff.  Still over all good app.

I would love to incorporate other tracking like blood sugar, sodium, blood pressure,etc., around issues of weight and BMI, AND have ability to graph and analyze these, share with doctors, print charts,etc.  I would like easier ways to enter strength exercises and everyday lifting chores rather than weights/sets/repetitions. Overall, ease of use and nice help with weight goal setting make this valuable.

It would be so helpful to be able the edit/complete a food in the database instead of having to open each choice up and try to find a version with the full nutrition numbers or to recreate a food from scratch because of one missing datapoint.

I can view my activity, meals and nutrients on a daily and weekly view, so if I eat more calories than my goal on a couple days I can make up for it on other days and see that I am still on track for the week. This app is fabulous, not only to view data on a granular level but high level so you have a better idea of where you can make changes to your lifestyle.

And rather than dreading exercise, or feeling like I'm lazy if I don't, I find myself excited to exercise, because then my calories for the day goes up and I get to eat more! I also really like the macronutrient breakdown.  I was wondering if I still need to supplement my calcium intake, and after a few days it was apparent I am not getting enough from my food.  So good to know.  And, I'm also losing weight! Hooray!

It makes counting calories so easy! My favorite part is the barcode scanner. Also, being able to see where you are for your daily totals is eye opening. I don't eat a lot of salty foods so I never thought that I'd be above my daily total of sodium. But I am.  It really helps me decide and make better food choices. If I see I'm low for my daily vitamin c, then I'll have a grapefruit instead of something else for a snack.  I've done different diets and I've really had to work at it. This just makes choosing to be healthier so easy. I plan my meals and workouts ahead if time and chart them. It's more of a check off list that way.

This app is awesome. I have lost 10 pounds in the first 3 weeks of upswing this app. The app is not going to make you lose weight, it makes you more aware of what your eating. I like most Americans love the taste of fast food and wouldn't think anything about ordering a whole meal with a desert at a fast food place, maybe a milk shake some frys and a hamburger? Well that's probably 2500 plus calories right there! Your done for the day! Lol. Now I find myself looking at what's the best low caloric, low sodium meal to order. Not that I have cut out everything that's bad for me, it's just in moderation because I'm mucho re cautious because of myfitnesspal! Thank you!

Visually, the app looks a lot like Weight Watcher's app. However, this app has a more comprehensive database of foods, and allows you to track calories, sodium, and so on, rather than points.  It also syncs up online, so you can access and update your data from any PC when your iPhone is not handy.

I have been putting off losing 15lbs, successful I might add. Until a friend suggested I use MFP to get me on track. I have been using it for three weeks now and I have lost 5lbs.  I find that using the app forces me to get a workout in to cover the extra calories from a treat. The step count ties in with my Apple Watch and so do my cardio workouts.  There are plenty of food items already logged into the list which make keeping track of calories, fat content and sodium easy to do.  I would recommend this app to anyone, whether trying to lose weight or just trying to make healthier choices.

I love this app!  Very detailed and informative.  Keeping track of what I eat makes me much more conscious of my goal.  I gave birth to twins two months ago and I love that I can add breastfeeding to my daily diary, which accounts for 1k calories burned (500 if you're nursing 1 baby).  I tried to use while pregnant but I didn't notice a daily activity to account for the extra calories needed during pregnant but I do see now there are plenty of options if you type pregnancy in the search area.  Has every food imaginable in the database, generic, specific stores, restaurants, even my target prenatal vitamin.

This app has helped me see how much I am eating and be more mindful about my choices. You can record calories burned from exercise, which motivates me to go to the gym more often. Recording foods is quick bec it has a big library of foods uploaded by the app or by other users. I shop at Trader Joe's and have found all the products I use in the app without having to enter it myself (been using for about a month). I wish this app could show you how much vitamin b, e and others you're consuming in addition to the std vitamin a, c, iron, etc but I suppose we are limited to the info typically listed on nutrient panels on packages.

This app is great for looking at your daily food intake & how different foods have "Bad" ingredients like too much sodium & trans-fats. It also helps you see where you get "Good" nutrients from  so you can eat healthier & understand your calories, carbs, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals & what size your portions of foods are. The previous version of this app was a lot better than this one - too many unnecessary ads & messages on the dashboard but it does have a few extra "cool" features that the previous version didn't have. I would like to see them add a daily reminder to log in with your food for forgetful people like me. But over all it's a great app!

Fitnesspal allows you to track your progress through tracking diet, exercise, and water intake. I love that feature that tells how much of your vitamins and minerals you are  getting from food sources. I was able to see that I'm wasn't eating enough fruit because my vitamin C was very low. My potassium intake was also low. No wonder I kept getting sick. Multivitamins are not enough. The barcode scan feature for all food is great and the database of foods is tremendous. Hats off to great designers!

Also has lots of exercises that you can key in like holding a 15lb infant and walking for x amount of minutes. You can also track your weight loss with this app too! It also shows you where you stand on nutrition such as how much sodium you've taken and etc. And at the end when you complete your log it shows your estimated weight in 5 weeks from now to put everything in perspective.

My goal is 185, and this app does a great job of letting me keep track of my calorie and fat intake on a daily and weekly basis, not to mention my calorie burnoff.  The best part of this app is how deep the database is.  I've been able to find exact brands using the search feature 99 per cent of the time, even when I think they are obscure.  It's nutritional chart is easy to read and lets you know whether you are receiving enough in the way of proteins, vitamins, or whether your fat and cholesterol intake is too high.  I highly recommend this app.

The set up is very organized and easy to understand. Keeping track always takes time but this is much better than keeping my own journal. It lets you make your own foods and you can save them for easier access later. I haven't lost any weight but I haven't been trying. This definitely makes you aware of what you are consuming, not only calorie-wise but it gives you a breakdown of which nutrients and vitamins you've consumed for the day based on daily value of an average 2000 calorie based diet. You can see the progress of your weight gain or loss. It's great and real!

This app works like a charm! I've lost 5 pounds since downloading it around a month ago, simply by tracking everything I eat through this app and lowering my calorie/sugar/carb intake a little. It tracks the contents of the nutrition labels of every item you eat, displaying not only your calorie intake, but all of the components in the food item like protein, iron, fat, carbs, etc. It then helps you to limit your intake of all of those by giving you a goal to keep your intake of those things under or at a certain number, that number varying depending on how much weight you want to lose and how quickly.

I love how I can view my daily food intake and it breaks down my vitamin intake for day.  I love seeing if I've gotten all my vitamins and protein, etc.   If you've eaten something and it'd not listed, you can scan it and the info I'd automatically loaded for you. I have been sharing this app with everyone.  Even for those not dieting it's good, to see exactly what areas your calories are going.

What a great app!! No glitches in the software. Runs great.  This is not just your average calorie counter. It shows you where you are in your nutrition for the day too!  You can see the basics-carbs, fats and proteins and how you're doing with each- or you can go in break it down and see where you're at with certain vitamins. Simply scan in an item (almost everything has a barcode now days), search for it, or create a custom food.  It was so much simpler than I thought it would be. Health is so much more than counting calories, it's nutrition in those calories, and this app does it!  I love it!!

Many items in this database were written by site users and often have important information missing.  The calorie, sugar, protein, carbs, and fat content are usually in the same ballpark (although there's still consuderable variation). However the vitamin, mineral, and nutrient data is often missing or questionable. For example a baked salmon (which is high in calcium) entry can either have no data on calcium, or have calcium values vary from 2.5 to 30% DV. Unfortunately, the site does not provide the source of the data, making it difficult to discern the more credible listings.

Started using this app in April and it's been great - reliably functional, simple to use, and easy to integrate with daily life & like-minded apps. I needed to start counting calories but wasn't interested in any commercial weight loss programs. This app fits the bill without gimmicks. Real time nutrition data is the best unexpected benefit - tracking what I eat during the day helps me figure out the nutrients I need more of (protein, potassium) or less of (sodium, sugar) at dinner time to end the day in balance. Reminders and the brief comments on food choices are friendly, unobtrusive, actually helpful, and optional. Integration with the Walk app is effortless and makes my self-help toolkit complete.

It feels great to meet EVERY nutrient need each day, and it's even better that this app does the math for you! It's fantastic and I feel better already. I have recommended this app to everyone I know, dieting or not. I only wish they made a version for toddlers! I would love to be able to keep an eye on what he eats with an app similar to this.

It shows me my goal for the day for each of these, and how much more/less I need for the rest of the day. Also, the barcode scanner works great too! It even scans and knows the off-the-wall organic stuff I love. I've had the app for one week now, and I've lost 2 lbs already! Highly recommend!

If you are actually going to track what you eat, this is the hands down easiest way to do it.

Also handy if you have food allergies cause its a great food diary to go back and see what might have been to blame if there are issues. (gluten, lacrosse, artificial sweetener for me)

I have never been successful tracking calories and exercise but this tool makes it so simple, whether on the fly or planning ahead. My only suggestions are 1) calories burned in exercise are added to your daily total of available food calories...I wish you could keep them separate so you know how much you have left to eat regardless of the amount of exercise you do, and 2) there should be a category for tracking vitamins/supplements. You can enter them under the snacks category but that seems odd. A separate category would be nice and seems like it should be a simple add.

It keeps me on my goals and ironically, I find myself pushing more and working harder. I can also see what areas (such as sugars) that I need to cut back on when I look at my "daily intake." So I'm already setting new goals. It is probably the most used app on my phone!

MFP really converted me from day 1, with its ease of use & critically, it's extensive database of meals from various cuisines. Since I am of Indian origin & also travel frequently on work , what converted me was that there is virtually nothing I eat that does not exist in MFP's database.

This is one of the few apps I use daily. I've noticed that I stay more focused on my diet when I use it than when I don't. The biggest influence the app has had on my diet has been the feedback of the macronutrients. When I saw the amour of sodium I was consuming I was shocked. So now, rather than just focusing on calories, I also monitor my sodium, fat, and cholesterol intake. I wished the app would have a time stamp feature, I like to know the frequency of my meals. And, I wish documenting the food was a little easier. For example, I often can't find the foods I eat a lot under the "Frequent Foods" tab. Overall though, it's a great app. I highly recommend it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Recently I was diagnosed with cancer. I was told the chemo treatment would be very hard on my body. I was not allowed to take supplements other than calcium or vitamin D because anything else would interfere with the treatment. I used this app to track nutrition and my blood work always showed me to be doing exceptionally well during the whole treatment process. I looked up the foods (googled) that would provide what My body needed and tracked my menu in the app. If I came up short on anything I looked back at my meal history to see the food I could add to bring me up to where I needed to be for nutrition. Great app!!!

I go hot and cold on diet/fitness apps.  I use it for a while then switch up but I thought I had finally decided that Myfitnesspal was the one for me until...... I have to pay premium to enter my own food's macronutrients?  Really? Did I have the ability to enter that information for free in previous versions?  I really can't remember since I switched up several times.  But this is a deal breaker for me.  I understand paying for special charts and detailed fitness tracking but not being able to  to track micronutrients without paying is too much for me.  There are plenty of apps out there that will allow that.  Even the ones you have to pay for  once apps (not per month!). See ya! Send me a message if this changes.

Time and time again I've been told to try a food journal; writing down everything I eat and drink to help keep my weight loss and fitness goals in check. Never did it...never understand how that would work, until I tried my fitness pal. This app is great! It keeps track of the calories, fat, sodium, etc that I consume and how many calories I've burned through exercise. There are amazing forums where I can talk with folks with similar work schedules or lifestyles; compare gym and workout tips and just get advice when my weight plateaus. All around just a really helpful tool!

It's excellent for anyone needing to keep a food diary for medical reasons, giving you your daily and weekly total of nutritional information, such as sodium, iron, cholesterol, etc..

Great app to help count calories and record workouts! You are able to look up almost any food from grocery items in the pantry to an entree at a restaurant and see the complete nutritional information. You can also scan barcodes to receive nutritional information. The app saves all of your meals for the day so you can see line by line how many calories grams of fat or milligrams of sodium (etc.) you have had for the day. This app is incredibly easy to use and is extremely helpful. It's a free download, so at least give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

I honestly had no idea how many vitamins, cholesterol and calories I was consuming in a day or week. I am shocked by my findings and it has definitely changed my choices. Nothing crazy but I'm making subtle changes that will have significant impacts down the line. And finding out which foods pack the most in terms of protein and vitamins. And sometimes I'll shoot above my goal but I can see that my saturated fat and cholesterol were actually low. I truly love this app!

I like my Fitness Pal but have been inconsistent in using it. Who really wants to be honest and record every morsel of food they eat? For entering food, I like how it saves items you've looked up before and saves the portions also. The barcode scanner is the best! Just scan the side of what you're eating or drinking, and ta da! It's all listed. The daily nutrition list calories , proteins, carbs, fats, vitamins, etc of what you have eaten helps you make wiser choices.

Maybe more nutrient listings would be nice like minerals and other vitamins, or a weekly break down of the nutrients. Either way it's really helping me and I think everyone should know what they are consuming day to day, week to week. Thanks!!!!

This is a great app, very intuitive and easy to use, and very empowering. The database of foods is huge, and when you do have a new item it's easy to add its nutritional info. Using this app helps me cut out snacking, make better food choices, and motivates me when I don't feel like exercising. Also, the app gives you a nutritional break down each day, which has been helpful in adjusting my vitamin & food intake since I was severely deficient in several categories. I only wish it was easier to edit recipes once they are saved, but the other fantastic qualities make this a 5 star app.

It has saved me a ton of time.  I love it!!!  I did make a few adjustments.  For example to the brand of cheese they selected.  Because the brand I used had less calories.  But they had my brand in their system as well.  The swap was easy .  I LOVE this app!

I've been using this for only a week.  One of the best ways to keep your mind focused on a goal is to keep a diary.  With MFP, I record everything I eat, and the advantage of using this app is that it records your calories, fat, sodium, cholesterol, protein, carbos, and many more nutritional metrics.  It credits you for exercise points.  The food database is tremendous, which makes recording thieves data ver easy.  I've lost 2 pounds already (although I should be losing only 1 per week), and hope to lose 14 more.  I think I can accomplish this easily and painlessly in 4 months.

Would highly recommend this app to everyone regardless if they're dieting, trying to lose weight, or just learning to eat healthier. I really love that it breaks down your entire daily consumption so that you can see everything! carbs, fat, protein - even vitamins!

This is the only app you need for health tracking. I have used others and found it to be the best. The food database is extensive. I like that you can just scan the barcode of a product and instantly get the nutritional info posted to your food log. Because I keep track of carb, fat & protein ratios I love the pie chart that shows exactly what these ratios are after every entry. I can even enter my supplements and it will show how much I've received in micronutrients and if I've met my daily recommended requirements. I can't believe this app is free, it is worth it's weight in gold!

Adding nutrition like how much omegas you are getting in would be appreciated. Also, if it had an option to tell you foods that you have ate before to recommend them if you are not all the way up on your calories. It's hard calculating yourself "well what else can I have that won't put me over?" This app is already doing calculations and I think it would be a great way for the premium members to enjoy it more.

The only reason I rate this 4 stars instead of 5 is that sometimes the estimate for calories burned for a certain activity are laughably high- and incorrect. More often than not they seem to be close, though. Overall, a fantastic app.

This app helped me lose 45lbs several years ago.  I still use it periodically.  However, the most recent version of the app took away features that I had been using and made them part of the premium package. The way they snuck this in was that after the app update my app would crash upon opening and I had to reinstall it.  The version after reinstalling it had removed the features that I was used to having.  This is just slimy and sneaky.  Just be honest and up front with your customers about removing once free features.  The $50/year cost for premium is too high.  Also, the number of ads now in the app is horrendous.  I'll probably stop using this app after relying on it for approx 7 years.

                      Title: A life saver!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I weighed 300+ lbs and my doctor recommended this app (legit, not lying). I not only can see what I'm eating through out the day (and drinking and exercising) but it also shows how many calories, sugars, fats, vitamins even. If you're honest to yourself and this app it will open your eyes to what's really going on. It's also a wonderful support system. Everyone on here is trying to do the same thing, be healthy, whether they need to loose 5lbs or 200lbs, or gain weight. So everyone is cheering for everyone! The only bad side is people added the wrong information on some foods so you need to really look at your labels and make sure they add up. :-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fabulous as a calorie tracking tool, it has helped me lose 8 pounds so far. Very eye-opening as to how many calories I was consuming in a day. Wish you could track water intake by ounces and wish it would recommend foods based on the nutrients I'm lacking. Love that I can scan my vitamin bottle and it puts that information in. Also wish it would sync with more exercise apps to track calories burned, it's too much of a hassle trying to type in all the exercises you've done only to have it not know approximately how many calories you've burned.

My friends recommended this app, and I love it! I have cancer, and I've also become a vegetarian. It's important for me to make sure I take in enough nutrients, and this app allows you to keep track of that! I also cook a lot and avoid processed food, and there's a way to add in your recipes, and even calculates calories and nutrients such as vitamins, protein and potassium. A bit time consuming at first, but completely worth it! It has a "maintain weight" option, if you're really more into making sure that you're taking in enough protein and vitamins. An extremely useful tool!

I've been using this app for well over 2 years but for 3 months consistent. I don't like having to search thru endless list for foods that don't fit what I've eaten or the hassle of imputing the info to create. Not too mention I do a lot of strength training but it doesn't even track the calories burned nor does it track the water consumption in a graph. I don't know if I'm progressing well or not if I only relied on this app to tell me. It needs to be more functional to work with the new health app on the iPhone by adding the calcium iron and so forth that we can't calculate on our own.

I really love the items you can track on this app (calories, weight), the large food database, ability to save meals and recipes, and its capacity to sync with so many other fitness and health apps.  I feel like it is missing a few critical items, though, given all of the research that is out now: (1) differentiating between naturally occurring and added sugars, (2) tracking micronutrients with the ability to set individualized goals for these nutrients, and (3) tracking number of servings across food groups. I know lots of folks want to see these items in the next update- please add!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is worthy of 5 Stars but the only thing preventing that is... It doesn't allow the user to create meals/add food outside of breakfast, lunch, dinner & snacks! I eat 6-7 meals a day and I have to add Everthing after my first 3 meals as snacks because there's nowhere else I can add them. Unless I add it to breakfast, lunch or dinner which already has a meal added. I'm hoping in the next update that they make it capable of adding a meal before breakfast, in between breakfast-lunch, between lunch-dinner and one after dinner and of course keeping the snacks too. Maybe even a section where I can add my supplements & vitamins. Other than that, best meal app hands down!!!

This app has really helped me control my eating and feel more accountable for what I consume. I love how it will break down your daily carbs, fats and protein ratios and it also includes some essential vitamins and other dietary necessaries so you can see what else you need to be eating that day. I always blew off the idea of writing down my eating habits, but this app has made it very easy and has helped me gain more control over my diet. I highly recommend it to anyone! I also like how it asks for your fitness, so you can see how much more you need to be eating on days you work out.

This app is great. I have been counting macronutrients for years now, and to not have to carry a notebook around all day and do the math to figure what I've eaten is sooooo convenient. It is a five star app for a person counting calories etc. for me it is a four star app only because you can't pick your exact %'s to break down the macros. You can get close but not exact. It would also be nice to be able to select just the nutrition values you want to see.. I.e. I only care to see calorie, fats, carbs, and proteins. I'd like to be able to hide the vitamins and monosats and potassium etc so it's less to look at. But again I stress, GREAT APP

As a vegetarian who uses lots of vegan substitutes in home cooking, submitting entries can be tedious.

But convenience aside, I can typically find anything one ingredient at a time. I use it just to ballpark my habits an encourage myself to take my vitamins. I'm doing this for weight gain, and nutriets are the most important thing; this app is easy to use and I highly recommend it. Even if you only use it for weekend you will learn a lot about yourself.

This app is so easy to use and is really helping me lose some kilos. First create a profile to determine your own unique daily caloric needs based on gender, age, goals, and level of activity. There is a huge food database and even a really sweet barcode scanner. Also, it tracks the breakdown of macronutrients (fat, protein, carbs), vitamins, and minerals consumed throught the week in easy to view charts and graphs so that you can, for example, check yourself if getting too many Cals from fat or not getting enough iron, vitamin A, D, etc. I love this program. Can't believe it's free!

I've been using this app for about a year now but have been seriously documenting my food for about 8 months. This app allows you to save meals and "remembers" food you often eat. Since humans are creatures of habit, this app becomes easy to use in a short period of time. It  illustrates the macronutrients you've consume and even pairs with other devices such as Fitbit. Since this app is free, there really is no reason to not give it a shot. You can upgrade to premium if you choose but  I have been happy with the normal MyFitnessPal.

I started using My Fitness Pal back when the features were still pretty limited. I stopped using it for awhile, but now that I'm back  impressed with all the new additions. I like how it tells you a little bit about the food you're eating, like "this food has lots of Vitamin C," or "this food is high in saturated fat." You can also see what sorts of goals it has projected for your daily intake of protein, carbs, sugars, and things like that. It definitely helps to keep me on track since I've kinda fallen off the wagon a little bit.

Gave the app at least one star because it is handy to keep track of calories. It is also the most suggested by physicians to help in weight loss.  How ever, since using this app I have started to receive many unsolicited email for products, books and websites and articles that seem very tailored to some of the specific information I have provided on my diary. Specifically on brand names of food products I scanned into my food diary. When I received an email for an alcohol detox facility (I only drink on average of 2x per week an 1-2 drinks over a 4-5 hour period) obviously Big Brother is scouring this app for personal habits and applying arm chair psychoanalysis as to our lifestyle. I will know delete this app and register under yet a new private email. All my entries will be vague as in calories only.

I have only been using this app for a week, and I already love it. It is so easy to use. I do wish there was different categories to add things such as vitamins and misc. drinks throughout the day. For example, sometimes I just drink a cup of tea during, but not with a meal. I wouldn't consider this a snack, but that is where I add it right now. I also wish the strength exercise section was a bit more robust. Sometimes I do strength exercises that don't really fit into a "reps" category. For instance, with the Wii Fit or something. I could enter everything separately, though. I will definitely recommend this app to friends and family.

I've not only learned how to better control my calories, but also how to watch out for sodium levels and increase fiber levels. Additionally, finding/adding food is super easy, fast and accurate!  This can be the most frustrating part of these types of apps and I find this app just so easy to use.

It syncs behind the scenes periodically to update the steps I've taken/calories burned. If I burn enough calories it gives me credit agains my daily goal automatically. Fantastic, easy to use, and does what it says.

The app also will track your exercise and predict weight loss or gain. You can add friends and share your diary with them so they can see what you eat. It is a great tool to stay on track and eat better.

It would be nice to be able to run reports on more than just one factor at a time. But it is still the best I've seen.

And go figure that it actually kinda works as adorn of motivation to work out, so you can still make your calorie goal for the day and eat more of what works for you!  Believe me, this is a true review; not a fake, "written by the same company who made this app" :-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app so much better than WW.  You can see your nutritional content as the day goes on and target what additional nutrients and vitamins you still need to acquire for a balanced, healthy diet.  It definitely showed me where my diet was lacking by evaluating this each day.  The database of information is wonderful.  The only negative I find is that it does not allow you to set your win calorie goal.  I am under Dr. supervision for weight loss and currently consume fewer calories than the app says I should...it gives me little notes every day in bright red that I'm eating too few calories!

This app is absolutely amazing. I have been using it for approximately 2 months to track my calories and fitness routine. It has taught me quite a bit about serving size and micro nutrition. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about their actual nutrition. I thought that I was eating healthy prior to using that app, but it showed me that my sugars were very high and often times my calories were too low or too high for the day. I have lost approximately 9 pounds with this app and my P90X routine. I highly recommend it.

I have only been using this app for a few days but so far so good. Like the barcode scanning feature. I eat a lot of the same foods so I like that it remembers frequently eaten foods so I do not have to look them up again. I am doubtful of the recommended calorie intake to lose 2 lbs per week but I also run a lot while having a sedentary job so I need more calories and still lose weight on eating more than what they recommend. Finally I like the daily summary that shows me my total nutrient and vitamin intake--encourages me to choose healthier foods.

I love this app. When I first started using this app it was in the hopes of tracking my calories and losing a few pounds. However there was a benefit I didn't know of and that is how it breaks down the nutritional value of everything you're eating by item and by day. In my case I had no idea I was eating foods with so much sodium. I never added a lot of salt to anything and I thought I was doing well, luckily this app let me see how high the foods were in sodium and might possibly have changed my future because I'm sure I was headed towards a heart attack.

Myfitnesspal is great!  Using this app, you can easily and simply keep track of meals, exercise, and the progress you make. Most foods can be found by searching or scanning the barcode. Most fast food and chain restaurant dishes are in the database. The app calculates your calorie goals based on your target for weight loss and you can share with friends to create a positive, supportive environment. Before you pay for some program like you see advertised on TV, give this a try for a month. It is worth it.

I've dropped 21lbs since I began using this app (2 months ago) - Happy proof that logging food and exercise=fitness success. 99% of the foods I've eaten have been in the fitness pal index- It is an awesome app - it has been a huge help in improving my health!

Thanks to this app, I can keep track of what I eat and be aware of my caloric intake. I didn't realize how quick the calories added up before. I would highly recommend this app for anyone serious about losing weight!

MyFitnessPal makes it very easy to count calories and view you macro and micro intake. All you have to do is look up the product or scan in the barcode. If you have a recipe, you can insert the recipe into MyFitnessPal and let it tell you how many cals or carb, fat, and protein intake it contains. Most people start losing pounds in the first week! Love this app and will continue to use it even after I've shed my baby weight. It even includes a "maintain weight" option. There are so many ways to use this app, it should help with everyone's goals.

I feel so much better about becoming fit! Now all I need is to exercise!

Increases awareness of what you put in your body every day. Just that heightened consideration increases the healthiness of my choices even if I don't strictly to my calorie allowance. Nice to be able to monitor sodium intake and the couple vitamins and minerals too. The only improvement would be to allow access to all previously scanned foods when you go to add a meal, rather than just the ones scanned for that particular meal. Sometimes A nutrition bar is part of lunch, sometimes it is a snack or it may be all of breakfast and those lists should be accessible from any meal. Would be nice , but still a useful app.

It lets you input almost any food you can imagine and it will give you the amount of calories that are in that food. It also tracks your calories for you as well as giving you amount recommendations of your vital nutrients (fats, carbs, protein, sodium). It's given me a great advantage and I've made all kinds of gains (excuse my hodge twins reference). Try it out and see for yourself.

Since I've been tracking my food intake I've realized what vitamins I'm lacking and how much salt I've consumed. It's helped me live a healthier lifestyle fitting for my blood pressure issues.

I've used this app for several years, and it's been pretty user-friendly and quite useful. But this upgrade (following the acquisition by UnderArmour) has introduced a LOT of annoying "features." The most obvious annoyance is the ads, which are not at all related to health and fitness (bikini waxing? Really? I'm a 63 year old man). But even the "helpful" and "encouraging" things are annoying. The whole point of logging all these foods is to let me keep an eye on my totals, which the app always did very well using the "nutrition" tab. But now, I enter something and get hollered at that I need to be aware of my limit for sodium, for example. Back off!

Initially, all I was after with this was a calorie counting app. But this is so much more. It adds up all the major vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein, etc. that you eat each day and estimates/compares it to the daily values you need. Also, the barcode scanner and recipe functions are huge time savers. Being able to enter the water you drink is helpful as a reminder too. The method of entering exercise is too clunky to get much use from, but overall I highly recommend this app. It's a must-have for anyone too busy to keep running totals of all the food they eat in their head.

I use MyFitnessPal to give me an actual picture of my health, and it causes me to think harder about what is in the food I eat. Using MyFitnessPal lets me see that there are healthy versions of almost any food; for example, I loooove pesto, but had no idea that the kind I was buying had about 60% of my daily sodium content, and I still added salt to other foods. So I found another brand of pesto, and cut back on sodium in other ways.

Love the barcode scanner feature that automatically puts all nutrition information in for you! Helpful if you're working out, losing weight or if you just want to live a healthier lifestyle.

I have used the Weight Watchers app before (successfully) and I like this one better, and not just because it's free. My favorite features are the barcode scanner and the screen that displays what your weight would be in 5 weeks if you ate every day like you did today. That definitely helps a numbers guy like me stay on track. The food database is more complete than any app I've come across; they even have obscure microbrews in there, which is probably my main downfall when trying to lose weight. Definite 5 star app.

Tracking the highs and lows over the whole time I've been using the app or some period of time (a week perhaps) so that I don't have to do the math for myself.

We now carry our phones in our pockets and it counts every steps and we can earn extra calories from our exercise. I will recommend it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I've used this app for about a year and i can honestly say this is the best way to track your diet. You simply plug in the amount of calories you need a day and then enter the food you eat and the amount you ate. It adds up the total calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients so you can keep track of it all. This is a great help for anyone serious about losing weight or gaining weight. No matter what your goal is, once you learn to use this app, you will wonder why you didn't try something like this sooner.

This app is super motivating, easy to use, and synchs up really well with my Kindle Fire and other work out apps. I love how much of a difference it's made in what I eat by having an easy place to post my meals and keep me accountable. I've never been one for "counting calories" but this app helps you understand your calorie income in a way that encourages you to make better eating habits. I also really love that it gives positive reinforcement and tells me when I've made a good choice by choosing a good high in protein or vitamins or low in fat.

I wish you could modify food names/info from the catalog for your own use, and add/delete foods from saved Meals.  Also, would be nice on the iPhone app to be able to compare diary foods sodium content, saturated fat, etc by going into landscape mode (the iPad version has all this info on the diary screen without clicking on individual foods, so if you plan a day in advance and it has too much sodium for the day you can find the/an offending food quickly and change/remove it).  Even with these minor flaws this app is awesome!

Plus, this ap gives you a breakdown on the nutritional value of the foods you eat each day so you can easily see how many carbs, protein, sodium, fat, etc., you are eating.  Then add the ability to track the ability to track the number of calories you are burning even for things such as light house keeping or mowing the yard and the ap becomes even better.

I put in stringent guidelines for myself and this app makes me feel every bit like I have a personal trainer looking over my shoulder. Since it does an excellent job of telling me just how much sodium and sugar food have, I notice that I am eating way too much salt and processed foods to keep the bars in the blue daily. Because I've been working hard to keep it all balanced, I've lost 4.6 lbs in my first week! Craziness. Probably mostly water, but I can tell I'm doing better, and am excited for week 5 to come along!

I do NOT like that there are so many choices of some items because of errors when creating a 'My Food' entry. I made a significant error entering one of my own and I cannot edit it, delete it, or enter a corrected entry under the same name. This drives me crazy! Please, please, PLEASE at least let us be able to delete a 'My Foods' entry so we can fix our entries. Especially if you feel an edit button would cause too many problems. Again, PLEASE consider this on your next update!

This app is great, much like Lose It!, but with a slicker UI. My only wish is that the vitamins and supplements info wasn't so ambiguous. For instance, it says today that I've had 85% of my Vitamin A goal. Why not give me the unit numbers instead? 85% of what, exactly? And why can't I specify what amount of Vitamin A I want to have each day? What about E, or B, or Zinc? I have a very specific regiment and I know what my goals are - I REALLY wish I could customize my own supplement list and specify each of their daily goals! Maybe you guys could make that happen - please? Thanks for a great app that has helped me manage my weight!

And now I'm not only paying attention to my calories but also vitamins and fiber - without planning to! This is one of the best free apps I've ever downloaded!

It tracks anything and everything you could think of, calories, macros,  micronutrients, water, measurements, weight, workouts. You can easily sink it with almost any app or fitness tracker. The food database is vast I think I've only found 1 food it didn't have. And the barcode scanning feature is awesome. I could go on and on but you get the picture. This is the best investment in your quest to lose weight you could make and it's free!

One of my least favorite things about weight watcher was the points plus. You were forever tied to weight watchers because no one knows what a point plus equals in calories. I have been surprised to see how much sodium and fat I was eating daily. I think this is a much more sustainable app for a true lifestyle change.

There IS some inaccuracies when you search for food but they're usually amongst a list of accurate entries (when in doubt do the math and see if the grams add up to the calories listed). Plus if you report it, they'll quickly check it out and remove it if it's not valid. Great app :)

There is also a way to track calorie burn with exercise to track how your cals burned offset what you eat.  Over time you can see exactly how healthy you are eating and accurately gauge your calorie intake over an extended period.

I've been using it for four weeks and it has everything I've look for.  I think being aware of what I'm eating every day has made me more conscience of making choices of what to eat and how much. Also, I like the daily and weekly summary reports for nuturition.  For example I've found I don't need to be taking a vitamin pill but do need to get more iron.

This app is wonderful! Not only does it keep track of calories and fat, but also vitamins, potassium, fiber, and much more! You can make your own meals, create your own food (great for homemade recipes), and look up restaurant food too! And when you don't feel like typing, you just scan the barcode on almost any food item from the grocery store. My favorite feature is adding exercise. It calculates how many calories are burned in virtually any form of exercise. I highly recommend downloading this app!

Also the barcode feature is amazing as it can instantly let you know what the nutrition facts are. Solid tool for tracking eating and integrate your fitness device like a Fitbit so you can adjust your calorie intake for the day.

I would like if the app broke my nutrient information down to more detail ( more vitamin and mineral info), and if you could select more options for changing portion sizes - so I can choose if I break my portion size down from cups, teaspoons, tablespoons and ounces. Other than those minor details it gives me a good picture of how I am doing that day.

The only thing that is kind of a pain is that some items show up in the list multiple times - with different amounts of nutrition data associated with them. It can make data entry take a little longer. All and all, this app is worth the monthly fee for me and I highly recommend it.

Also the fact that you can scan foods but not have accurate info is not ok certain food labels don't give sodium or other information on barcode. Other peoples entries are not always accurate so you need to be careful if your strict on your meal plan. I use this app daily and love RUNTASTIC being linked to it to document my cardio. The app is worth the purchase and recommend it to whomever needs to track meals and progress like I do.

                      Title: Soon to be smoken
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is fantastic. My most favorite thing is not that it counts your calories but it counts your total sugar, fiber, carbs, protein and vitamins and more. Plus it's completely free. It is motivating to watch it all. In one month I have already lost nearly 12 lbs of the 25-30 that I planned. Due to medical reasons I can only walk, but it's also connected to exercise apps. My only complaint is that it adds calories to your total for the day when you burn them. So I just watch my total intake not what I have left.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Great app, easy to use/navigate, (good design). This app has a large database of food items to choose from which is helpful when going out to eat. Also it lets you scan barcodes of food packages which is great for home. Unlike other calorie counting apps, it balances your carbs-fats-proteins, and tells you your daily allowance of vitamins, sugars, etc. I would recommend this app for anyone who likes to stay in certain weight range, and for anyone that likes to learn about the nutritional value of certain foods.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

As a physician I can confirm the usefulness of this app. Fancy or fad diets do not work. Period. The only way to lose weight is to decrease caloric intake and increase exercise. The problem most of us have is that we have no idea of how we fare with this equation. We tend to underestimate how much we eat and overestimate how much we exercise. This app let's you measure, and thereby modify both. You can eat whatever you want provided you stay under your calorie limits. If you are honest and stick to your goals you will lose weight

The best thing about this app is that it is with u whenever u eat- most ppl tend to have their phones on them all day.

I've lost 6 lbs in less than a week (my wife has lost 10!) and it also motivates you to get your exercise in each day to help make sure your net calorie count is under your goal.  Although it's free you get some features that other "free" apps make you pay for through add-ons like a bar scanner and sodium content.

This is a real powerhouse of a little app and will do just about anything the average tracker could want. The only improvement in my point of view would be a way to track more nutrients--as a pregnant woman I want to watch some of the more unusual nutrients, like folate, choline, et cetera. It would also be convenient if you could turn off brand foods somehow; it gets a little old scrolling through pages of fast foods and prepared foods just to find something simple like a potato! But it's a great start and the price can hardly be beaten. ;)

I have been able to stay on a program for 6 months and have made my weight loss goal of 25 lbs because this app helps me be accountable.

Other than that, it's a GREAT program...

The app is easy to use for calorie counting and nutrition breakdown. There is a great database of foods; however it can get a little confusing as there are multiple entries for similar generic foods. I wish it were easier to find the generic foods that have the most complete micronutrient breakdown. For example there are multiple entries for Roma tomatoes, but only some of them list the potassium content. I also have had a few minor issues with it syncing with the apple health kit and runkeeper on different occasions.

It would be a very helpful feature.

Would definitely recommend this app to anyone intent to monitor calorie intake. Might add, my husband is diabetic so I can also monitor sugar & sodium using this tool.

Take this app with a grain of salt! It's awesome, perfect as a calorie counter and protein/carbs/fat percentage goal tracker. However, a few flaws. For example, it recommends a max of saturated fat intake, but defaults to 0 for unsaturated, which is actually a heathy fat for you. Therefore, whenever you consume any unsaturated, it freaks you out with a big red negative number. Also, it puts you in the negative zone when you go over your protein and vitamins, which certainly should be encouraged (to an extent of course)!

I have never been able to keep track of what I'm eating before this app. It takes the guess work out of "what to order when eating out" and keeps me on my diet.  I can also show my physician exactly what I have been eating and exercising over a period of weeks and he knows it's accurate.  The database and the ability to scan your product deserves the Nobel Prize for Healthy Living ....if one existed in that category!!!  I love you My Fitness Pal! Your not just my pal your my best friend.

This app will help you lose weight period. As long as you eat under the calorie goal it sets for you and log all of your food you will lose weight. It may be slow or fast but it works if you are willing to put forth the effort. It is a great tool because once you start logging everything, you know exactly what you can eat for the rest of the day. Stop being lazy and get this app, put forth the commitment and change your life now!

I love the app, it's great it helps me track my calorie, sodium, and fat intake BUT I personally do not like how it does not show my weight going down WITHOUT me putting in my weight manually. I don't have a scale at home so I wouldn't know how much I weigh. I thought this app would help with that too, but I guess not. If when you guys update the app you can make it so that I can see my CW based off of how much I'm eating so that I may see my progress. I think it would be helpful to everyone.

My sisters and nieces have also become fans all using the app. We don't all have the same goals but each of us find it helpful. Together we keep each other motivated. It's not just counting calories but tracking carbs, fats, proteins, vitamins, and fitness. Must have fitness app!! Thanks :)

MFP has an amazing database and barcode scanner. You can also connect with friends through social media platforms/emails. Try this app! You will not be disappointed!

Plus you can label meals that you cook over and over again (so you don't have to retype ingredients a thousand times). Love it!!! Recommend it to all my friends and fam!!

I never write reviews, but this app is so great you need to know about it! Fantastic app for tracking calories.

I just figured out how you can see the nutrients you consumed vs. what you should have. I was really low in a could vitamins so I was able to select food better the next day. And my carbs were way to high. Figured out it was the protein bar I had. Great app!

I didn't use it for the first few days and was shocked at how little of some vitamins I was getting, and how high my sodium and fat content was while eating at or under my calorie goal. I started taking a multiple-vitamin and making better vitamin rich food choices and I must say, I feel better than I have in a long time, and the weight is melting off.

When synced to my Vivofit all calories burned for the day automatically modify my caloric allowance.  I look forward to my body balancing out and watching the weight drop off.

The My Fitness Pal app motivates you to be mindful of your food, exercise, water, and strength training choices. It gives feedback as you track your food intake. For example, "You've hit your vitamin A goal for the day." There's a pie graph that shows where your calories are coming from, and at the end of the daily entry it sends a message saying "if you eat like this you'll weigh ___ pounds in the number of weeks specified."I'm hooked and seeing results over the past few weeks.

Great app to get organized with weight loss or become aware of patterns in food and nutrients consumed.  Very easy to use.  Exercise variety is a bit limited.

Would LOVE some trouble-shooting features in the app -- like an email or other message to me with "sodium was really high yesterday, here are three steps to cut sodium" or "you have exercised consistently for five days -- way to go" or "how's the weight management going?  You've been tracking meals, but not updating your weight."

I also wished it categorized how many servings of each food group I'm consuming instead of relying mostly on calories to indicate good eating.

I am still logging everything and have not gained it back five years later. Tip: read your nutrient details at least weekly. I watch out for sodium, carbs, protein, and fat. I am trying to increase my vitamin, iron and calcium levels I get from my meals. So I check my nutrition details daily.

This app is great because it helps keep your results measurable. At the end of each day, it tells you how much you would weigh in five weeks if everyday were like that day. I find that data to be very motivating! I started at 128 pounds about five weeks ago, and now I'm at 121 pounds. I've never been able to lose weight over an extended period of time. I've only ever done crash diets. This app is very good! I recommend it to everyone I talk to about weight loss.

A great tool to know whats really going inside of you. When the weight stopped coming off, I knew I had to start counting calories. This app makes it easy to keep track, and also gives you other important information. For example it has showed me how out of whack my sodium intake is (processed food is full of it). In order to be healthy, you have to know what you are eating. For me, reading labels is not enough, with this tool you can make better choices!

This app takes a simple approach to weight loss: set your current condition and it helps you set a goal. Add calories for foods you eat, subtract for exercise. If you like, it can also keep track of your DV of vitamins, fats, proteins etc. and gives you those daily goals. The best part is the searchable comprehensive list of foods that everyone compiles collectively to make finding your meals easy. You always have the option of entering the data yourself.

My fiancé has always done weight watchers and swears by it, but it's expensive and you have to self regulate. This counter does the same thing and it's free!  You still are responsible fully for entering and watching your calories but all of the tools really make a difference. The breakdowns of vitamins, fats and carbs show what you should be adding to in your diet. This app is a huge fitness motivator.  When you go over on calories for the day it motivates to burn some to get back under your goal. I love it.

I didn't consider myself overweight, being 185 lbs., however I did have some extra body fat I wanted to lose. With the help of myfitnesspal and regular exercise (5/6 days a week), in 6 weeks I dropped twenty pounds while still building muscle mass. I don't think I could have done it without this app since it tracks the details of the food you eat, like sodium and fat, and keeps track of your progress over days, weeks, and months.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The only reason it doesn't have a five star from me is because I wish it could determine the good foods from the bad foods. Like they are all configured on the same level and I would like for it to have recommendations at the end or something to help people understand what is good food for their diets and bad foods and ok foods :) other than that this is the first app I've used everyday as far as counting calories at the end if each day I look forward to the weight I would be at the end if the five week period 😉😃 95% satisfied

This app is awesome! It goes above and beyond anything I could have ever thought of. Not only does it count your calories, but it keeps track of how much fat, sugar, sodium, vitamins, iron, etc. that you get every day. You set goals and it helps you reach them, whether it's losing or gaining weight. You can see the percentage of everything you eat like carbs, protein, and fat. It does so much more but I use it every day and I've become more aware of what I eat and how much I eat. It's fantastic!

This app is great! I've tried other calorie tracking apps and this one is the best. This app has foods on it that no other app does and this app does not only count calories, but it help tracks fat, carbs, sodium etc. Which a lot of other apps don't track. I think this app should add a barcode scanner, it would help add foods quicker. Other apps have a barcode scanner but it works poorly. If this app had one I believe it would work much better. Other then that this app is fantastic.

MFP is incredible! I tried other calorie trackers, but MFP blew them all out of the water. The new barcode scanner cuts tracking time in half, too (I will admit that the dedication required to track literally everything you eat is definitely time-consuming). It's never been unable to find a food, and I love that it tracks my vitamins, too. I hate having to take a multi-vitamin. This app helps me get my nutrients the old-fashioned way: by eating healthy foods.

Diet is 70% of weight management and the app keeps me out of the dark when it comes to knowing how many calories I'm consuming and mostly important the nutritional facts of my meals!

It's a whole lot easier keeping track of what you eat specifically or by ingredients you eat. I use this with my Microsoft band and so far my workout diary or logs feel a whole lot more complete with this app.

I used to keep a handwritten food and exercise log, what a jump forward to MFP. Ease of calculating nutrition of home made dishes a plus, and barcode reading is fantastic.  Integration with many other tracking apps is great and hopefully more will be added periodically. One feature I'd like to see added is the ability to subtract calories (ex: a restaurant meal minus half the bacon). Also I'm disappointed that adding strength training doesn't appear to credit any calories. But, I keep running across features, there may be a way.

Some show up but others I cannot find. Thanks to my niece for telling me about this app. A winner.

This is also a great way to track if you're getting enough protein, iron, calcium, and vitamins, as well as monitor your sugar and fat intake. Love it!

I'd like to see the water and exercise print out on the nutrition reports, but the info that is provided gives a great view of what you need to adjust in your intake of protein, sodium and sugars which are important in watching your diet. You'll also be nudged when you're slacking off.  Great tool!

My only downside is that I would like it to be able to track other Vitamins like B12 bc it's so essential but I'm not entirely sure I'm always getting enough of it! Also a place to log in just drinks would be nice so I don't have to keep logging them under snacks.

With only about 10 more pounds desiring to lose, MyFitnessPal is an awesome tool in helping maintain and stay on track, not only with calories, but also with the intake of fiber, sugar, sodium, etc. It is only as accurate as the user is precise when logging, and of course, there are times when guesstimating is necessary. So, the app is not totally without flaw. But, it is an awesome and useful tool for the price, "free."

The barcode reading feature is a brilliant addition. For future versions, it would be nice if the app tracked more vitamins and minerals to ensure adequate intake. Also. If there was a way the app could encourage strength training that would be nice. Currently, strength training earns nothing (no calories burned). Some type of reward would be nice for strength training.

But if that happens, I keep track of it mentally. Its a great app to hold you accountable for what you eat! And I really like seeing the tallys for vitamens A and C, plus other minerals, so I can make sure I get enough of those as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have only good things to say about this app. I wish the folks at body bugg were this thorough. The ability to scan barcodes here is my favorite. It even recognizes generics, my vitamins, and ingrediants like flour or butter. I also like that at the end of a day it gives the "if every day were like today" to let you know how well you're doing. This app is amazing. 5 stars from almost 17,000 reviews means they're doing something right.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this app.  I can't believe all the features it has for being free.  I am basically addicted to it.  It is great because you can plan out your day according to net calories ate/burned, and every food imaginable is in the database.  I also really like that it tracks your nutrition of the day, such as calcium, sugar, and protein consumed.  Not only will this app help me lose weight, it also will help me become much healthier.  I have already recommended it to friends. Download it!!

I LOVE the pie chart it helps me so much but that's all I feel is missing .. Aside from the fact that I wish it was easier to input exercises or that they were more customizable for entries. Overall a really awesome and helpful app. Keep up the great work!

This app tracks how many calories, fat, protein, sodium etc. is in everything you are eating completely taking the guess work out of loosing weight. It's even has a barcode scanner to scan your favorite store bought snacks! Now I know that extra cookie or scoop of ice cream is really not worth it.  This is definitely changing my life! If it wasn't for this app we wouldn't have been successful!

It should show a daily nuitritional total of each showing the amount of each needed daily.  This will make you aware of what you need to consume daily for a healthy diet as well.   It should tell you the amount you need of each & the amount you have consumed  on a daily bases.  Like the calorie counter app does.  That addition would make this app perfect.

There should be meal 1, meal 2, up to 6 at least with the time you've eaten. Other than that this app is the best app period. I highly recommend it but it only works if you are honest with yourself & let's face it, fat people, like myself, aren't too honest with themselves. Ergo our problem. Be true to yourself & watch the calories come off.

Logging my food intake and exercise keeps me accountable.  The database for food is incredible and makes it easy to track calories. I only wish that for strength training I could make a single entry for circuit training for a set period of time and calories. Instead, I would have to enter each individual exercise with total weight lifted and reps.  I do 30 minutes of total body strength training 3X per week- it would take too long to manually enter each & every set.

If you're like me you may think you are getting enough fiber but really aren't, this app will tell you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Much easier than Spark People and I don't have to deal with reward points or being asked for my testimonial every week. However, resistance training does expend energy and yet no caloric deficit is given for this activity. Also, common exercises like Burpees and mountain climbers aren't on the list, so I have to enter push ups and jumping jacks. Boo. The new feature where the app praises me for eating good things and warns about fat/sodium/sugar is very cool. Solid app, but let's get the strength training up to par please!

If you want to know the nutritional value of just about anything this is the app to have!  Atkins and weight watchers have nothing over myfitnesspal!  Myfitnesspal has THE largest library of foods I've ever encountered (and I've looked).  Not only does it gives you the figures:cals, fat, carbs, fiber, protein, sodium... It shows the food that you consume in a day in a graphic layout so that you can see quite clearly what percentage you have consumed in fat, carb and protein.  I love it!!

Most things can be added but it's a hassle. For example broccoli doesn't have a brand name nor does whole oat groats or carrots yet I must add a  brand. It's clumsy. Also, if a food is added to my lunch list I might eat it for dinner. Nope, I have to go thru all the steps and add it again under dinner. Exercises are good and I like the water meter. We need a place for accomplishments and notes like 'lost 1/2 inch off my waist,' and 'new thyroid support vitamin started today.' It's ok for now but I'm on the lookout for a more intuitive app.

If you're looking at apps for calorie counting, you won't find any better than this. The database is large enough that most everything you need is in it in some form. As a fitness tracker, the app is good for cardio, although it is a bit lacking on resistance training and is missing stretching altogether. I would like to see some additional fields added, such as vitamin B, D, caffeine, etc for us total health buffs. All in all a fantastic app!

I have never counted calories as it is such a hassle and pain but this app makes it stupidly simple. I've yet to come across a food it doesn't recognize.

So for someone like myself who has suffered from low iron levels it makes keeping track of my health a ton easier too. THANK YOU for that!

The only thing I don't like is that it says you shouldn't eat monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat but some of those are good fats and you get them from omega 3'a. Overall great app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Great app, easy to use, fun and a little addictive! My coworkers and I are doing a little weight loss challenge and so we all started using this app to motivate and monitor each others progress - making it fun. Personally it helps me to see daily if I'm within my calorie allotment, what my fiber and iron intakes are (cause I'm troubled with low iron) and motivates me to drink more water and eat more of the things that replenish those deficits!! So an all around great app so far.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I started using the app to track what I was eating so I could see what set off my allergies, etc but I gave been shocked at the difference it has made in my life. Simple discoveries like "this has THAT many calories!!" and how low I am in potassium but almost double in sodium have reduced my mindless snacking and has me seeking out better food options. It's even encouraged me to exercise more just to be able to fill in that space each day!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I've used many food tracking apps, including fee-based ones like Weight Watchers, My Food Diary, and others, but this app seems less gimmicky and more about getting the job done! I'm on a low-sodium diet, and I'm able to easily track that, too. Great database of foods generic and branded; just wish some of the everyday foods had more serving size options (cups vs. ounces, for example). Love this app!

I'm not gonna say much but it was very helpful for me. If you can keep up with logging your food then you will learn what the word "portion" means. I've only been using it for two weeks but I've lost almost 7 pounds because this app lays out for me what I have eaten and how much I should be eating for the day. The nutrient tracker also reminds me when I've had too much sugar or not enough iron. It's a good app and I've already recommended it to several friends.

This app really helps keep in on track though my weight loss journey. The only thing I don't like is that it needs more ethnic based foods. My family is from a different country and a lot of my dinners are what my mom decides to make. She tries to make healthier alternatives to her recipes (e.g. Instead of frying she bakes or using salt she will use season with little to no sodium). Other than that little discrepancy I like this app a lot!

This free app is a great benefit if you are trying to watch your calories. I also like that the daily values are amendable online; for example, I noticed that I have way too many grams of sugar each day and that I don't get nearly enough iron. It helps with monitoring that quite well. Also perfect that it syncs with my fitbit. I've lost 6 lbs so far and have about 15 to go to get to my goal weight. This will sure to be a help.

I know what nutrients I tend to lack (potassium and iron) and I make sure I eat foods high in them for a snack. I love how it motivates me to work out every day to get those extra calories in my daily bank.  Sometimes I'll save a couple hundred cals a day so I can splurge on the weekend and not feel guilty.  Totally keeps me on track.

Also the charts could be  improved.  I still give it five stars.  It works just like you expect it to, even though there's some room for improvement.

I have a Fitbit that I use to track my steps and aerobic activity.  I look periodically throughout the day to keep an eye on my totals and make sure I don't have a negative balance.  So imagine my surprise when I look back at previous days and it shows a negative balance when I'd end the day with positive numbers! Maybe it's user error but how are you supposed to get an accurate read of how you're doing?

Great app for tracking calories and nutrition. More challenging for logging activity. I have an IPhone which the app says tracks steps. Imperfect at best. Misses a lot of activity. Also to log cardio, you need to look up the calorie amounts yourself and then enter them. My biggest request would be that they create a way to set nutritional goals based on common dietary restrictions like diabetic, low sodium, post gastric bypass, etc. The nutrition charts are only based on healthy person recommendations.

Definitely keeps you on track to meet your goals. I wish someone would go through the food lists periodically and delete erroneous information. As an example , the nutritional value for 1 cup of broccoli should not vastly differ between 3 different entries! Perhaps foods should be marked or "starred" to indicate they have been vetted by a nutritionist so we can better gauge our entries. Otherwise, still a five star rating from me!

After 5 weeks of weight and cardio training I hadn't loss any weight. The problem was that I had no idea how many calories I was consuming, was still eating over sized portions and was taking too much sodium.  After using the app for one week I loss 4lbs and am on the right track by eating smaller portions and healthy food. Not only can this app track caloric intake, but it keeps me on track and I avoid snacking.

Right now they are tied as one entity so I have a bunch of redundant workouts defined with no ability to see how I trend for "Day 3"

--------------------------------------------------------------------

My mom and I googled top 10 best weight loss apps. This one was #1, so we decided to try it. We both love it and she has already lost 4 lbs in 2 weeks! It's really nice to have an idea of how much fat, carbs, iron, etc you are having. It really makes you watch what you eat. I love the reminders you get when you have not added breakfast, lunch, or dinner. You feel like you have your own personal nutritionist!

This app has helped me be more aware of what I am putting in my body.  By tracking calories as well as nutritional breakdown, I realized I have much more sugar and sodium intake than I thought.  I appreciate the accountability to my friends and the encouragement they provide.  I especially love the recipe builder which allows me to find healthy modifications by experimenting with ingredients.  I have recommended this program to everyone!

I like the app for gauging my exercise vs. eating on a daily and weekly basis.  You can also see mid week if your sodium or fat is too high and correct for the last few days.  It gets tiring entering every day, but is just a good tool to pull out when you feel your eating or exercise is out of wack.  It puts you back in line with an overall health routine.  I recommend it!

Also it tells you your nutrition facts for the day, and that makes it easier to see if you have a low iron or sodium intake. All in all I love this app and think it is very easy to use

It was recommended by a friend and it has already helped me lose a pound!

Really good app for free. Have read a lot of reviews that upgrade wouldn't be worth it. I do wish it gave more specific information about the foods in our diet; for example, if we consistently go over in vitamin A, what foods should we avoid/substitute, or if we're consistently under in one area, what foods could we add to our diet. Other than that it's been great. Definitely would recommend.

It even tells you how many vitamins/minerals/salt/fiber/fat you are consuming each day. It's exactly what I needed.

Also the ability to customize carb to fat to protein ratios would be good for advanced users.

This app is very simple to use & if does become addictive. I highly recommend it for anyone trying to lose weight or just live healthier. I only wish the exercises included different types of yoga and the diary tracker kept track of Vitamin D. My only dislike is that your recent foods are only saved for quick access under the meal you put them under, not every meal.

I like it. But, I need a couple of additional features. When entering items for a single meal especially if I'm cooking from scratch, it's time consuming to enter each item from scratch. It would help to be able to select the meal and enter all the items for that single meal. Also, having the ability to see the nutrient breakdown for each meal to track fat, iron, calcium, potassium, sodium, cholesterol, etc would help in ensuring that a meal not only met the caloric intake but it was also low sodium, low fat, etc.

My only complaints are that it doesn't include every food (understandable), that it doesn't track some important vitamins, & that it under/overestimates some of what your daily intake should be of certain nutrients. Overall I'm happy I have it.

Currently, the app doesn't provide any feedback for strength training, only cardio. And there are only a few vitamins and minerals listed so if you're highly concerned with the content of your food, you'll be left wanting. Other than that, it's a great app in its current form.

This can certainly be used for weight loss, but it is a great all-purpose tracker for your daily nutrition. Be sure to include your vitamins and supplements in your daily diary. It has an AMAZING database of foods - I haven't yet found a food that isn't there. My favorite feature is the scanner, which allows you to scan the UBC bar of any packaged food to automatically store in your diary.

Really a great way to keep track of calories. It has a barcode scanner, you can scan in your foods for accurate nutritional information tracking. You can also search foods that do not have barcodes. The database has every food you can imagine by generic and brand names. Until this app I didn't know that I wasn't getting enough vitamin c. I use this app daily

I am able to keep really accurate logs of my diet and make sure I am consuming enough calories. The nutritions view is also useful in keeping a running tally of the vitamins, salt, protein, etc. Great app overall, check it out.

I love this app because it is so much easier to use than any other app. I can also sync my Fitbit to the app to collect my exercise data. It just has a lot of incorrect data when logging food. Needs a good cleaning out to eliminate the completely incorrect food logs. Otherwise it helps greatly with my macros and seeing how much of each vitamin and nutrient that I'm getting to stay on track!

I have used it on and off for the past four years, but when I was dedicated enough to use it, it was very helpful.

Would be great to break down your intake of the basic food groups, example, I know I'm eating too much fruit and not enough veg.  Still a great app

This way, if you have too much of something you can isolate what food is causing the problem and eliminate or adjust it.

This keeps me accountable because its on my phone and I have no excuses for not tracking what I'm eating.  I'm training for a Half Ironman and my coach and I share my password so she can track what I'm doing and monitor my protein intake...so easy with the charts!  I recommend this to everyone!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Compared to Weight Watchers app. (which is roughly $20/month) this is essentially the same, but instead of points they use calories- and it's free. Good way to track what you're eating for a healthy amount of macronutrient and micronutrient proportions to aim for a balanced diet. :).  Love the amount of exercise options and food lists.  Has just about everything, and lots of vegan foods too. Great app!

Also app no longer syncs with Fitbit Tracker. The "Connect" button just takes me to the website to purchase one. I already have one-it just needs sync button to work. If I were going to pay for this app, it would have been the old version prior to today's undesirable changes. 1 star is being generous after the latest failed update. They ruined my most used app. Will look for another one now.

Would be nice if we could enter manual food items such as vitamins/supplements (and regular food items with more options). More entry fields like the vitamins & minerals (ie: Vitamin D, niacin, folate, potassium, zinc, manganese, Vitamin B6, B12, Omega-3, 6 & 9, etc.), not just what shows on a 'Nutrition Facts' label. Milk for example has Vitamin D, but I don't see this as one of the nutrition fields.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I've used this app for over two years and it has helped me lose over 50 pounds! It's so easy to use and it tracks EVERYTHING (cholesterol, fiber, fat, sodium, etc). This app helps hold me accountable and it's so cool to be able to look at all the charts and see the progress I've made. I recommend this app to anyone who is interested in losing weight or living a healthier lifestyle!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The app itself is mostly good. It does a great job of calculating nutritional facts which has helped me immensely! However, its integration into HealthKit is full of bugs. Previous data doesn't show up in the charts, when current data shows up, it's located in the incorrect time intraday, and Vitamin A doesn't even work. I'm sure fixes are in the queue at the App Store, so I will upgrade my rating when they come through. I recommend this app if you aren't using HealthKit for now.

Sometimes the app entries don't match up to the web site and sometimes it can't connect. Also, there are a lot of duplicate entries and you can't tell confirmed entries from other entries in the app.

My eating habits were not high in fat as I thought, they were high in sugar and sodium. This app brought to my attention the true problem with what I was eating. Very helpful tool to keep yourself on track. Sometimes it's not the fat content that you need to reduce. I was also low in potassium which explained my hands being unsteady. Highly recommend this app to use as a guide.

I'm using this to help me GAIN weight and to keep track of my calcium (I have osteoporosis).    The data base is huge--I don't think I've scanned anything that isn't on it-- it's been a real eye- opener to see what I'm ACTUALLY taking in compared to what I THINK I'm taking in-- easy to use after you spend some initial time learning to navigate and entering in your own basic foods, meals, and recipes-- and it's free!!!!

I also love the summary feature that lets you know if you've met or exceeded goals for other nutrition such as vitamins, saturated fat and cholesterol. I highly recommend it.

Now I track everything to make sure I am doing well. To all those who want to loose weight don't take into consideration the calories you burned working out and then eat "more" because you have extra calories. Remember "calories in, calories burned" is what sheds weight :)

It would be nice if the app can give progress update on exercise goals and analysis of vitamins etc. Overall, this app has been indispensable for me in loosing weight and I recommend it to anyone counting calories.
