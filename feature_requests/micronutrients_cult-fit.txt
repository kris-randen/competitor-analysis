Have been working out for over a month at Cult and around 15 days on live.cult I can easily say these guys are doing amazing work in keeping up fit and active even in quarantine period. Have also enrolled for live PT sessions which is also a good addition. Have also tried their yoga sessions. Simply amazing!! They have good App and good backend support. All in all I would definitely recommend it to everyone who wants to keep himself fit and active.

                      Title: Your app is okay  but what so ever No contacts makes it dodgy startup company
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The app is not bad lots of useful informations for people looking for fitness videos. No proper clarity in your website or application makes it difficult to believe you people are genuine. But I am not sorry to say this,  your eat.fit kitchens and it‚Äôs locations where  unhealthy food ingredients in use and unhygienic filthy horrible kitchens and the direct venues of cult.fit and care.fit are unsafe and threat to humans in existing cities and still you people are busy expanding and entering into other cities and in Dubai as well.Signing up a lots of new subscribers with limited slots is  a cheating business with weird terms and conditions that are not customer friendly which is printed in a tiny microscopic words will not help you to be trusted brand or company. A company with NO contact person names and  numbers makes one thing  clear,  it‚Äôs not safe to subscribe any plans with your cure.fit and regret for being cheated.
