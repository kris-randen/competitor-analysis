                      Title: Poor articles; great images
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The interactive images are beautifully rendered. But like other reviews have noted, the articles are bland, out of date with current medical advice and uninformative. For example, it says to be limit fish to 1-2 times a week and only 1 oily fish, while most OBs are increasingly emphasizing the importance of the omegas in oily fish. Other articles are the typical round up of vapid takes on the usual topics of what to eat and buying clothes and talking to your doctor if you feel down. These could be much more interesting! Also, in an article about possible Down syndrome testing in early pregnancy, they say only that ‚Äúsome women prefer to find out during their pregnancy so they can learn more about the condition and what special care is required.‚Äù It undermines the pain and extreme difficultly women wrestle with as they decide whether to keep a pregnancy with confirmed chromosomal problems. Pretending that doesn‚Äôt exist at all is really weird whitewashing. It‚Äôs not a political issue.

                      Title: *Nearly* perfect - can‚Äôt adjust cycle length
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is absolutely incredible. It‚Äôs really everything you could need and want in a pregnancy app. Lots of information, planning capabilities, and my most favorite feature - the weekly growth aspect that offers true to size fetal development. My ONLY gripe is that you cannot adjust your menstrual cycle length, so if your periods aren‚Äôt exactly 28 days, the only way to track your pregnancy is through a due date. That‚Äôs certainly not a deal breaker, but when I look at my calendar I would like to be able to see my LMP. I have PCOS and ovulate close to 3 weeks into my cycle, so I would just like to be able to customize my calendar to reflect that.

                      Title: Best pregnancy tracker I've found
--------------------------------------------------------------------

After I saw those little pink lines I downloaded every pregnancy tracker app I could find, including the two apps I already had accounts with because they were connected to the period and fertility tracker apps I had been using. I spent a little while getting to know all of the apps, and this was simply the best one. I almost never spend money on apps but I bought the premium version of this one. It is the only app I will be using for this pregnancy.

                      Title: Not Truly Free
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If a company is going to offer a free product, make it free at the time of download. Period. Otherwise charge up-front at the time of download. Women download this app thinking they don't have to pay for the content, then after 14 weeks, surprise! You have to pay to play. That is not transparent at all. Especially since it's not mentioned on the detail page of the app store.

I‚Äôm sorry but there are way more apps I can go to and still not be charged for what call consider ‚Äúextra‚Äù or ‚Äúpremium‚Äù if you want a good pregnancy app that‚Äôs not a scam I‚Äôd suggest ovia I've used it for years I even got pregnant both times using the period app they make. Don‚Äôt let these people rip you off. It‚Äôs not worth it. Spend that money on the baby and not an app.

                      Title: DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Over all, I like this app BUT it waited until I was 28 weeks pregnant to tell me that the free trial period was up and I had to pay $3.99 for the full version. If I would have known that, I would have done it 28 weeks ago. Now it's like I'm forced to buy it and I won't be using it after the baby comes so why waste $4 for a few more weeks of use? I'm promptly deleting it just on principal. Not fair guys! Some apps I've had on my phone for years and actually get some use out of. Those apps were not even close to $4. This app is just a glorified ticker if you don't have the full app. At 14 weeks it also stops showing you images of the actual size of your baby. It also stops giving you updates on your baby. Your better off downloading "What to expect when your expecting" app or "baby center" app, which are born FREE! I don't mind paying for apps, but I want to be able to use them, so this one is a waste.

                      Title: Fun at first
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Kept me busy at first but went through the info pretty quick.  Planning tools (appointment scheduler and weight tracker etc) were handy though.  Overall, most of these apps are pretty redundant, filled with mostly generic "official" recommendations that I learned in high school biology.  I'm a microbiologist and physician assistant and so I suppose I am looking for something that digs a little deeper into the less obvious, and even addresses the controversial issues and science of what makes for the healthiest pregnancy.

                      Title: Uninstalled
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Started using this app when I found out I was pregnant. I'm now 15wks and last wk (my 14th wk) the app stopped working. I contacted someone by email to only be told that the app stops working on lite version at 13wks (not stated in the description btw), so disappointing app! Unless you dnt mind paying for it after the "trial period" as I'm calling it, dnt even bother installing. There's plenty more good quality pregnancy apps out there that offer the same services (baby's development and your body changes) FOR FREE! I'm actually loving one right now, that I started using just yesterday.

                      Title: Hate having to upgrade !!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a great app and I looked and heckled it everyday in my pregnancy until week 14 and then I got cut off unexpectedly because I had to pay for the rest of my weeks of pregnancy. Absolute crap !! What a serious rip off. You should make the Pro version like other period tracker apps that you can upgrade with cooler things as an incentive, not to track your 3/4 of pregnancy. Very upsetting. It honestly was the best pregnancy app that looked the best and had the best pictures and information. Pretty sad.
