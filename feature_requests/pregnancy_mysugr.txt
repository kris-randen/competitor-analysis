                      Title: Really good! Could easily be great.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been using this app (I pay for the Pro subscription) for over a month now to track my glucose, diet, supplements, and medication for gestational diabetes. I love that it integrates with my Apple Health so it automatically shows how much I’ve exercised, the steps I’ve taken, and even confirms my glucose readings as my Contour Next app also integrates with Apple Health. The automatically generated reports allow me to easily keep my midwife updated on my readings. My one and only complaint and the only reason I’m docking a star is this: why can’t I see my scheduled reminders and update them? Once you input a meal the app allows you to set a reminder. However, once it’s set it does not display that you’ve even set one anywhere within the app or allow you to edit it. I’d also love to be able to set a daily reoccurring timer within this app for my supplements and medication since I also track it here, but there’s none to be found. This would be a really simple add that would take this app up to perfect!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is great overall. I’m using for gestational diabetes, and at my first meeting with a diabetes counselor, they were really impressed with the data report mySugr generated. I love that it syncs data automatically and wirelessly from my glucose tester.

                      Title: Love the Bluetooth
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I had gestational diabetes 5 years ago and I have it again. I no longer have to log my blood sugar in a logbook to show my doctor. I can just do the blood drop and I don’t even look at my meter. I just do it and shut it and can rest assured that my phone captures it. Then I can look at it at my leisure.

I love this app the is my second time with gestational diabetes and I wish I would have had this the first time it helps me feel sane and in control of my situation everything is right there in front of me black and white. I only went 24 hours with the free version it’s worth every penny to go pro! I did the 2.99 a month because I only need it a few months but if I had type 2 $40 for a year is worth it

I’m really appreciating the way this app is making my complicated journey with Gestational Diabetes easier. Logging my numbers is simple and fast and I appreciate the options to customize my entries by noting wether the reading was fasting, post meal, etc., while also being able to list exactly what I ate. I am pleased enough to upgrade. Thanks so much for a useful tool.

                      Title: Needs coffee
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Having been diagnosed with gestational diabetes, this app has been a great help in tracking my glucose. However, it needs a way to track coffee consumption! I can mark soda or diet soda as part of my meal, but not coffee. Definitely need that adjusted. I will also go for days with no issues, then suddenly I have to re-pair my phone and meter every time I take a reading. It only takes a minute or so, but it can get frustrating.

                      Title: Great program
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This has been a great program to track my Gestational Diabetes. Great to have on hand to record everything from snacks to insulin doses. I wish one think was clearer. I paid for the subscription so I could print out my reports to send to my doctor to help w/ prescribing insulin doses, but the pale colors on the report don’t fax well and isn’t a clear to read package for them. More color contrast would help.

This is exactly what I wanted for tracking my blood glucose level and food every day for gestational diabetes. It automatically syncs with my Accu-Check Guide, and allows me to add photos of meals and notes easily. The user interface is awesome. Using for two days and already feel like I can’t live without this app!

I’m 8 months pregnant and have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes. I haven’t been perfect with recording meals and blood sugar levels, but I know I wouldn’t have done nearly as well without this app! Being able to import my levels straight from my monitor and keep my meal times and contents in one place has been awesome.

After a diagnosis of gestational diabetes I was asked to fill out a paper log of my blood sugars 4 times a day. I investigated and found this app where I can log and then export the data to send to my provider. This has worked great and only complaint is the export always shows 4 weeks so comes out small.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have gestational diabetes, and I've tried several different apps. I particularly like MySugr Logbook because it allows me to track with photos as well as food types and descriptions, it lets me easily export my data for my doctor to view, and I can set up reminders (in the paid version) to check my post prandial blood sugar. There are challenges built in that keep me motivated to track everything, and that data has helped me determine how to control my sugar through my diet.

Getting diagnosed with gestational diabetes sucked. All the tracking and poking and rearranging my life around my eating schedule has been hard. This app not only gives me a single location to keep all my tracking notes, it gives me a little smile as my sugar monster giggles and "noms" in response to every entry. It's amazing what that little bit of positive feedback does to brighten my day. And my nutritionist was very happy to have so much information at her fingertips when I handed in my two week report.

I am positive that if the diabetes is still an issue after delivery, I will be using this app as well as upgrading!

                      Title: Great
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is wonderful. 5 year old daughter is Type 1. We found ourselves needing to remember what she had eaten in the last few days, up to a week prior and couldn't recall. This app lets you put food entries and so much more. It has helped us to keep up with her changing insulin needs just by logging her meals, carbs and correction amounts. She uses a pump and we are able to correct by 0.025. The only complaint I have about this app (and why I gave the app 4 stars instead of 5) is that when I go to log the app the correction her pump says for her food/high, I can only put two decimal places instead of the three that the pump does. Currently, I just put a note on the entry that says if she was given a correction that ends with a 5. The way the app does it right now isn't an issue if, for example the pump gives her a 1.250U correction; I just put it in the app as is. But, if she gets, for example, a 1.225U correction instead, I have to make a note on the entry to clarify that she got the .225U correction, not just .220U. Other than that small hiccup, it's fantastic and wonderful and we love it. We don't let her use the app herself because she can't read yet but she watches us do the entries and we let her poke her diabetes monster. In time, we're going to teach her to use it since she'll be starting school this coming August. We plan to use it and have the school nurse, and possibly teachers, use the app to help us track her diabetes while she's at school. I find the diabetes monster noises particularly cute, myself. There is a kid version of the app which we have fiddled with a bit. She will probably use that instead of this one when she is a bit older but still. It's a great app. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with diabetes. In fact, I have to my aunt who is Type 2. :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I just got diagnosed with gestational diabetes in my third trimester of pregnancy. You can imagine how hard it is to learn all the diabetes stuff while being completely exhausted and 8 months pregnant. This app has really mad it easy for me. The reminders are good so I don't for get and it's so handy to have at every doctor appointment! I even told my nutritionist about it and she loved it too and is going to recommend it to other patients!!!! I also think it's great they have a junior version for kids!!! I paid for the full app and I feel like $19.99 was worth it! Plus the support team is really on top of answering any questions you have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently took in an insulin dependent Type 1 foster kid. She didn't come with instructions! She was removed from last home for medical concerns and her numbers were all over the chart. This app has been priceless in helping me track everything and work on getting her numbers in check. The charts have allowed me to communicate with the school nurse better, and once I can finally get a doctor appointment scheduled we can analyze her trends! I started with the free version, but quickly upgraded to the paid version. This app is easy enough for the both of us to use. We both have it downloaded on our phone and as long as you log in with the user ID you do not need to pay the upgraded amount for each device. Just a one time payment of $19.99.
