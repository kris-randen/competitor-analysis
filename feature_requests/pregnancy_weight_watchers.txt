                      Title: It’s getting better with each upgrade
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I first became a WW member 3 years ago, and back then, the app was pretty nice. Unfortunately, my heart wasn’t in the right place and I ended up leaving the program a month later. I gave it a second chance a year ago, and I found the app to be better than the last time I used it, because they added the barcode reader and definitely made tracking easier. I left the program a few months later because I became pregnant, but came back as soon as I could, and I was totally amazed with the upgraded app. It has a way bigger library than it used to, and it’s even more user friendly. The only reason I didn’t gave it 5 stars is because sometimes it’s hard to find some items. For instance, the other day I was looking for “fresh strawberries” in the search engine because I wanted to track it, but because I was searching for other packaged snacks before that, the option list only offered stuff like “frozen strawberries”, “dried strawberries”, “strawberry cereal”, etc. I got tired of scrolling down looking for what I wanted, so I waited to track the strawberries later in the day. I know this could be solved if I save the items I want, so it’s easier for the search engine to figure out what I’m looking for, but sometimes I forget (yes, I suffer from “mommy-brain”). I don’t know if the problem can be fixed, but it would be great if it could.

                      Title: Game Changer
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ll keep it brief... so I bought a scale after 3 years of not owning one and was up to 265 from 235. I had started showing signs of failure in my body that my P.A., Sister and Nurse, fiancé had identified. Main indicator was the fluid on my ankles. Especially after eating anything with salt. After researching, I decided to try the WW app. In 6 months I’m down to 228 and headed to my goal of 215. No more swelling of the ankles and I can even have salt again without it creating an issue. One thing that the app has really done for me is to make different choices across the board. That is the true feature that can change the same old game that we have played, probably, our whole life with the weight roller coaster (which is really bad for you). Feeling great physically and mentally and looking forward to living longer because of the choices that WW has educated me to make. Of course, I already knew what I needed to do but this technic that why have created after decades of work, really hits you in the forehead like a 2x4! CHOOSE LIFE!

                      Title: Fantastic program!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve comeback to say that I deleted and re-downloaded the app which completely fixed the problem I was having on my watch. I love this program. I’ve done WW on and off for years and this go round is the most successful I’ve been. I started faithfully tracking on 8/27 and since that time I’m down 12 pounds. I’ve been doing so well that my husband even decided to join and he’s lost 22! Then, my brother and sister in law were on board and they’ve also lost in just the few short weeks they’ve joined. This program is so adaptable and friendly and even caters to the breastfeeding mom like myself. Sure, sometimes the app has glitches and bugs, but all apps do and this one isn’t perfect by any means but it’s never hindered my success on the program. I highly recommend the new freestyle/WW program. Get together with a supportive person and do it together, it’ll make it so much easier and when you refer a friend through their email you both get a free month! Don’t put your health off for another day!

                      Title: Finally, I can lose weight and not feel hungry!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In the past, I had used apps like MyFitnessPal that do a great job of tracking calories. I would faithfully track the calories while I gained weight. By contrast, the WW app counts points, not calories. This app enables me to eat a lot and lose weight! I went from eating cereal and milk for breakfast to eating plain Greek yogurt with fresh fruit. For lunch I would eat cut up chicken breast in low point soup. At the grocery store, the app’s barcode reader would let me (actually my wife) scan sauces on the shelf to find the ones that were zero or low points, i. e., those that did not have added sugar. With the help of this app I had lost 18 pounds in two months and was on lifetime six weeks later. I have continued to eat a low-carb diet and have lost 33 pounds, which is Closer to an ideal weight even though that is below my goal weight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love WW! With three young children, and still breastfeeding I needed something to keep myself honest with my water intake and nutrition. I wanted to lose some baby weight while keeping my milk and helping my energy level so I could keep up with my children and be all in for my beautiful life! Weight Watchers mobile was the answer! In 9 weeks I have lost 16 pounds and my milk supply has actually gone up! I sleep better and I’m not so tired and cranky all the time, definitely have more energy! The app is so convenient because it keeps track of all my health data in one spot and links to my Fitbit! I have my points, my water, my exercise and sleep all tracked in one spot! And I love the green plan with all its 0 point snack options to fill me up with healthy energy and I don’t have to track them when I’m on the go!

                      Title: WW App
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the years I have used the Weight Watchers program with initial success, and then the tracking and calculating would become too arduous. Eventually, I’d go back to my old habits and the weight would come back on, plus. I joined WW again in June. I was the heaviest I’d had ever been, pregnancies included. I hadn’t heard of the new app, but was ready to work the program again. At 65, I knew I had a long road ahead of me. Then I used the new app! It has truly changed my life! The app makes it very easy to track, calculate points and best of all the information is at my fingertips! No more hunting for my tracking book, adding and re-adding to be sure my totals are correct. With the app, there is only success ahead of me! I have lost 30 pounds to date.  I hope to reach my goal weight by the beginning of the new year! Thank you WW!

                      Title: Losing weight thanks to this app!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I returned to WW after I realized I needed help losing weight I had gained with a pregnancy over 4 years ago. Years ago I had to either write everything on a tracking paper or use the little points counter which was a step up. This app blows every past method away. It helps me easily track my daily points, scans barcodes so I can quickly check things as I grocery shop, has tons of wonderful recipes for any food you can imagine and there is even a social media site where you can post, comment, or just scroll to see how other members are doing. I can not recommend this app enough to anyone who is already a member and not really using it or to anyone contemplating taking that step to join. I’m down over 15 pounds in 2 months and still going strong.

                      Title: The App Keeps Me on Tract
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The WW App sets the program apart from all the other weight loss programs. The ability to scan store products removes guesswork and tedious calculations. Those are huge barriers to staying on a program. The database of exiting food points and restaurant foods educate me and help me learn about healthy choices. Reading about the success of others, seeing pictures of their transformations and getting support from others in the Connect feature is a great motivational tool. I’m impressed by the frequency of improvements in the app. Most recently features like Siri and fitness coaches have been added bonuses. Uses of the app keeps me on track because it’s become a valuable research tool and a habit that keeps me mindful of my status each day. Is it a day of maintaining, losing or a choice to postpone my goal? I wouldn’t know, without the app.

                      Title: Connect on the WW app is Great!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I use Connect every day to help myself and others. My encouragement can make a difference for someone who is having a rough time of it in their life. I particularly share with those with alcohol and sugar problems as I have that too. I am the member who lives in a skilled nursing home and share about how I have to do this eating institutional food. I would love to cook and make those zero points meals but I still have mostly blue dot days. I have had my room redone here and completely changed the atmosphere to make my space special and beautiful with paintings from my travels and hobbies. I would not have been able to do this without Weight Watchers and the support I receive from my coach, my followers on Connect and my saint of a supportive husband.

                      Title: Could be a lot better
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is great for tracking foods, scanning barcodes, and tracking weight. However, I feel like it’s upgrades behind where it needs to be to compete with other food/fitness apps. Connect is great, but it’s so slow. I scroll through 5 posts and I have to sit and wait until more populate and sometimes that means the app makes me start from the beginning. Also, when I scroll, I end up “liking” every post because the touch it’s so sensitive compared to other apps. I wish the app had algorithmic technology. I like to look at about 2 different kinds of posts (low point meals, transformations) and I personally don’t care to scroll through pregnancy announcements, videos of people’s pet ducks, or acceptance into the peace corps. The app can also just stop working and slow down—that should not happen to a company with over 1 million subscribers.

                      Title: For the most part...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For the most part, the app is great. However, there have been numerous times, almost a daily basis where I’ll type a food in and get some really random answers. For example, say I type “milk,” I might get “milk duds” or “creamy pasta” or “potatoes.” Ok, it may not be that random but it doesn’t always bring up the item I am trying to find. It seems like it is the simple stuff that I have more of an issue with.

This program has helped me so much. Im always on my phone and scheduling work and home. I have always been on the heavy side and thought i would have to think seriously about  surgery to help me find the Willpower to not eat so poorly.  I dont eat a lot of sweets. Im a meat and potatoes girl. This app has changed my life. I didnt realize some of the things i didnt think were too bad like MILK could actually be one of my worst food items because of the quantity daily. In 25 days I have lost 26 pounds. I really do have more energy and look forward to learning more about a healthier me. Im 45 and the future looks bright.  I would say Good Luck but if you follow the app you wont need it. 🧚🏻‍♀️

I am a person who has always been able to lose weight on my own—until my third baby! I have struggled with 20 lbs for 2 years now and needed something simple to help me along. Within the first day I realized how many snacks and extra servings of food have been standing in my way of weight loss. Yesterday was a hard day and I splurged on a high calorie protein bar which put me over my points, but today is better. It just creates simple boundaries and reminders of food choices! For some reason i also find that it encourages exercise, I’m sure there’s some psychology to this with the app. It works!

Weight watchers is incredible. I rate this so low just to warn you not to purchase a weight watchers plan through iTunes. Just do it right through weight watchers. I bought a year subscription through iTunes. Six months later I became pregnant. Weight watchers does not allow you to do their program while pregnant. Weight watchers would have refunded my money. iTunes refuses. They said it’s outside of their refund timeframe. So now I have a plan that I can’t even use. I am very upset with iTunes. It’s about $110. This is a special circumstance and they couldn’t even make an exception. DO NOT BUY THROUGH ITUNES! (Weight watchers is great though and I highly recommend it!)

This app has helped me go from post pregnancy weight of 154 pounds to 125 pounds. I like how It is simple to use and cost very little compared to other food tracker apps. They have lots of resources such as recipes, tips, and weekly goal setting. It has motivated me to stay on track with what I’m eating and working out daily. The points are given for each individual persons weight goals. You can also earn points daily and use those points that you earn for prizes. If you are self motivated to lose the weight or get fit this app can help you get there.

I’ve struggled with my weight all my life. I did weight watchers two years ago and lost 30 pounds. Then I got pregnant and had to stop. After my delivery I had postpartum depression and gained more weight than during my pregnancy. I had pain in my joints and couldn’t even wear my wedding band. I decided to sign up again with just the app and within the first week not only did my joint pain stop but my wedding band fit again. It’s not a diet but it’s a way to teach yourself to eat the foods that are beneficial for your body instead of those that don’t. It’s definitely worth it.

I’m a third shifter and it’s kinda annoying I have to spilt my points for one of my days between two days. Or I don’t use all my points. I’m sure there are many people who work different shifts that struggle with this. It’s not like after midnight I can stop eating either. As a nurse we have a high demand job and need food to fuel our energy for our long shift. So please make it third shift friendly not everyone is on the normal 24 hour day

I left WW a year and a half ago because I got pregnant. Just joined back and the app is so cumbersome and not user friendly. I can’t find where to weigh in without scrolling all over and clicking all the icons on the bottom. My scanned food list has never updated - it has random things from 2-3 years ago that I can’t remove but if I scanned something 5 minutes ago it won’t show up (it has been like that since I downloaded the app originally). I think WW tried to simplify the app’s appearance but it is difficult to navigate. I would appreciate a new, straight forward app. I’m not downloading it for aesthetics; I am downloading it to work for me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Joined WW on jan 10th and I’m down 10 so far with the help of this app. Only one enhancement I would suggest is a break down somewhere that it tells you “you ate these many carbs, this much in sugar, you need to eat more fruits/veggies.”  Weight watchers is great because it sets you up for a lifetime of mindfulness but they need to emphasize in the app how you do it. Technically I could drink one milkshake a day and an app and be within points. But that’s clearly not setting me up long term. It would be nice to know where I need to improve.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

As a busy wife, mother & nurse, it’s hard staying on track sometimes. Over the last 5 years I’ve tried multiple ‘weight loss’ apps, with little success. WW has been a game changer. Weight loss is 80% food intake. Many people forget this. Even myself! WW lays a solid foundation for you to be able to make the best, healthiest food choices. I gave up too soon when I began this program over a year ago. I thought a month was long enough & I was wrong! I restarted on 3/6/19 & I’m down 20#! I recommend WW to anyone!

Do wish the good I eat just about everyday would be in the look up window. Easier to track.  Overall, love the app and WW!!

I used WW after each of my 3 pregnancies and lost weight. Years later, after putting on weight due to my own eating issues, I tried every diet one could imagine and none of them worked. It took so many attempts at trying to lose weight and then seeing a friend and her husband do WW that I decided to go back to what works. I put my husband, son and I on WW and the results are amazing! Altogether we lost almost 35lbs in 2 months. WW works...period!

I still miss the old WW point system,  I lost 20 pounds before I had my baby back in 2012.  This is the second time I am trying this system,  and the only way it seems to get the most out my points is low fat and no fat.  It is advertised you can eat what you want but in reality that is if it is no fat or low fat or eat 0 points to save for the meal you want.  I would like a choice which system I want to use when I am paying for it.  I want the old 2012 version.

Bring it on while keeping the great encouragement from leaders and members.  Thank you, WW!

Isn’t WW about health?  I haven’t once tracked the 2% milk in my coffee and managed to lose 100 lbs anyway. Change your methods on this please if you really are About health!

Being able to quickly log my lunch, or scan a snack is what helps me stay on top of my points! Also, when I work over night shifts, it’s easy to over eat since “breakfast, lunch, and dinner” are thrown off of their usual time frames. Totally worth the monthly fee to manage my over all health

I stopped and restarted a couple times.  My weight kept going up and I could not stick with it.  Eventually I got above my starting weight.  Every change that they made made it harder to stick to.  I also got frustrated with the constant pushing of yoga and meditation.  I am done with WW.  I am going to try something else.

I tried to add my lactose free milk to the database in ml, since it’s easy and precise to weigh on my scale and my milk’s nutrition label has the serving size listed as 240ml. However, the ml measurement isn’t an option when adding a food (or calculating at all), so I had to list it as “240 servings” rather than “240 ml”. Works okay for me, but may be confusing for any fellow weight watchers who try to use the food I added.

I’m happy with the app! The scanner works so smooth it makes logging points easier than ever! WW has always helped me loose my baby weight. I’m a nursing mom and this is my third time to use WW. The system works for me and I’m able to have a good supply for my baby.

I’d be lost without the WW App! I use it when I food shop; big points stuff doesn’t even make it into the cart. If I see a delicious item, I whip out my phone and - ugh - that baby goes back on the shelf! No more guesswork!

This app has so much to help you be successful! Between COVID eating and having a baby I needed help losing weight. I’ve been using WW for  5 months and am down to pre-baby and pre-Covid weight. I’m going to keep going!

I was told when I hit menopause I would pack on weight so I did. I made no changes in my eating habits or work. Joined WW read, listened, tracked and lost 12# first month. Starting second month.  Just doing the program...baby steps. 🥳
