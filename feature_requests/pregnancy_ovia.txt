                      Title: Easy but basic
--------------------------------------------------------------------

By far the best pregnancy app out there! The kick counter and contraction timers are GREAT. I adore the growing hand and foot images as well, so precious and it just helps the whole experience of pregnancy feel more real. I also really appreciate the anonymous community feature as well! On my of biggest frustrations with other apps is questions being ignored/unseen because I wasn’t a “top member.”

                      Title: Flexibly useful
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m nearly 18 weeks pregnant and have been using Ovia every day for months. When I first found out I was pregnant I installed five different pregnancy apps. Ovia quickly became my favorite because the health tracking is so flexible and intuitive. I’ve been tracking my sleep, weight, and symptoms, and ignore the parts I’m not interested in tracking (e.g. mood, nutrition, exercise). I also like that there’s a nice-length article each week and some daily content that isn’t too overwhelming.

                      Title: Mostly great
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When I found out I was pregnant, I downloaded several pregnancy apps to see which one I liked best, and Ovia won out easily. I like the interface and the customization. I love the daily and weekly updates and little blurbs about what to expect from my body and what was happening with Baby and it’s development. The ability to track food, weight, symptoms, doctor’s appointments, just about everything is great! The way that articles and videos are broken down makes them easy to search and find what I want to read. And the medication and food safety look up has been amazing and saved me a lot of unnecessary phone calls to my midwife. This only reason this rating lost a star is because I felt like the high level of daily interaction became all but non-existent once I went over my due date. I’d get one targeted advertisement and maybe one blurb about “is the nursery ready?” or “only a few days left”. I missed the timely articles, and wish that instead of recycled blurbs there had been articles about induction or how common it is to go overdue. I know those sorts of things exist because I could look them up in the app, but I wish they had been automatically showing up on my feed as a means of reassurance. Overall a great app, but updating it a bit would be even better.

                      Title: Community feature needs to be improved
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app, it’s great I can see what’s going on in my body, if my symptoms are normal, babies development and it keeps my super informed. I do have 1 problem with this app, the community where we can ask questions. Your inbox fills you up with a bunch of questions to answer from other moms and sometimes the app. The problem is there’s no organization. As a first time mom whose due in December I see questions from moms later in their pregnancy and I’m wanting to view their answers to questions so I know what to expect but I can’t view the questions answers unless I answer her question, how is that helping moms? I’m having to answer a question that I don’t know anything about. It should be like a mini social media platform. Where there’s a feed and I can make it to where I can see question from people the same weeks as me, or their be different categories not random question popping up. The inbox should be used for notifications when somebody replies to your comment or somebody else replies on the post. Also the questions from the app should be in its own section of the app where we can click on it and answer it and it only questions that are relevant to how many weeks we are. Right now it’s asking me questions that aren’t even relevant.

This is one of my favorite pregnancy apps for tracking the baby’s progress. I like how you can also put in doctors appointments, track weight, BP, etc. The daily reminders for prenatal vitamins helps if you’re the sort of person who might forget.

                      Title: Love it but....
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have really enjoyed this app a lot! I love seeing different things that my baby is the size of each week. The last 2-3 months though have been very frustrating!! Every single time I first try to open the app, the loading page appears for a good 30-40 seconds and then the app just closes itself. Usually trying a second time works just fine, but now there have been a couple days over the past week where the app will just keep closing itself no matter how many times i try! First of all the loading page lasts way too long... second of all why should i have this app taking up space on my phone if it is just going to choose not to work whenever it feels like it! One of the couple days i had just mentioned, i was at the store and wanted to use the food safety lookup...in Heinz sight i should have just used safari because i knew even if it was working like usual (second try access success) that would still be a full minute or more of waiting for it to just load!!! Safari takes less than a quarter of that time! Please fix this problem as i still love everything else about this app!

                      Title: This is THE app to use!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I downloaded another popular app when I became  pregnant and quickly got burned out on it - it was all advertisements and fashion advice. I downloaded Ovia and WOW am I glad I was still in the 1st trimester when I found it. The interface is user friendly, the content is truly about my health and the health of my baby, not about what other people think or what I should be wearing. I love being encouraged to log my food and vitamins, and have truly been eating more intentional foods since starting it. It’s encouraging, informative, and my husband even got to subscribe to the daily emails! It helps him feel involved and he has been following the recommendations for nutrition by going to the grocery store for me without me even having to ask- the app is telling him what we need! Love this app! The only function I wish it had was an option for a more detailed food log, and the ability to list more specific high-risk categories that aren’t preloaded. I’m high risk with a connective tissue and joint hyper mobility disorder but there’s currently no option to record it as it’s uncommon.

                      Title: Okay but misinformation and advertising agendas abound
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Way way waaaaay too many ads in general but especially so for the same, narrow topics like cord blood banking. It’s something many parents don’t and won’t do, and the proliferation of ads for it just makes me want to do it even less. It smacks of cheesy marketing scam. The information really dumbs down things and makes me feel like I’m in the wrong, non-scientific app geared to airheads. I don’t know many women I consider airheads, so I really don’t know who this is for. Also topics like “are sit-ups safe?” are sorely misinformed. Sure, yes of course they’re safe for the baby up to a point at which sure there’s a minor risk of reducing blood flow while on one’s back. But they’re extraordinarily damaging for the pelvic floor and directly cause diastasis recti in many women and people in general. And then of course there are absolutely random posts like “what is bipolar disorder?” — not a topic that is very relevant for most first trimester women. Like why are we even talking about it? That’s said, interface is cute enough and modern enough. I like the “my baby is this size” comparisons by week, and the app is generally inclusive of various types of relationships, genders etc.

                      Title: Great App but Update Left Something to be Desired
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have really enjoyed using this app for my first pregnancy! I like the week by week articles, the fun themes, and the tools like the symptom checker and food/medication safety. However, there are a couple things I would improve. Since the last app update, it's harder to look up and find medications to record. In the previous version, it would keep your recently used meds (like prenatal vitamins) up at the top so you could easily find them. Now I have to search prenatal vitamins every time which is frustrating. Also, the kick counter was moved off the front data screen and moved into the more tab, which doesn't seem to fit for me. That is something I use everyday and data that I would like to be able to chart out (it's a higher priority for me than the activity tracker). Overall, the app is great and I do recommend it to my friends. Just a couple things that I would change to improve ease of use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Since I have been pregnant with my little one this app has helped me out a lot. It is so informative that I feel like with each week as my baby grows I learn something each and everyday about my little one and it’s development. As a new mom to be I feel like this app gives me a piece of mind about everything as far as development of baby, the symptoms that I might experience that I might experience throughout each stage, sending me reminders for my doctor’s appointments. The articles they have for diet, exercise, recipes, and other useful things on the app. This is the only pregnancy app I’ve ever had and I must say I’m glad that I did it right the first time, this app is amazing. I recommend this app to everyone that’s pregnant, you will not be disappointed and you will be well educated just like I am now!!! This app definitely has me looking forward to meeting my little one.

                      Title: So informational while keeping it fun and visual
--------------------------------------------------------------------

From the moment I found out I was pregnant up until this very moment with my son curled on my chest, I have found myself oh-so many times reading the updated and offered articles. The information readily available is pretty accurate down to the examples given and solution offerings. It was nice to see week by week what to expect and how to handle and now as he grows there’s new facts provided that reassure a new mom he’s on track (actually ahead of) but to know there’s others experiencing the same if not similar and learning and growing with their child as well. Without either of my parents to confide in, I depended on this app with any question or possible concern throughout my now; 10 month journey. Thank you kindly for this wondrous resource. Pray others find it and are able to enjoy as much!!! Definitely a 5 star and highly recommended app. (Which I have referred every expecting parent in my life)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve used multiple pregnancy apps for tracking my pregnancy and Ovia is my favorite! It’s the only one I use now. The information and tools it provides for you is so helpful, and I like the option it gives you to pick a theme for your baby’s size comparison (I chose animals, and my baby is a platypus this week - so cute!). The community of mothers on here also seems to be a bit kinder than what I’ve witnessed on other apps, more willing to be helpful and supportive and keep judgements to themselves. Even if someone expresses a difference of opinion from the current thread, they’re just nicer about it than other message boards I’ve seen. My ONLY issue with the app is that it’s difficult to actually get into. Each time I open it the loading screen is up for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sometimes it’ll close me out of the app before loading. Sometimes it’ll load my dashboard or the message board but it’ll be frozen so I can’t actually click on or scroll through anything. It’s a great informational tool, but it can be kinda buggy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently 13w pregnant, and let me tell you, this is the best app I’ve tried. Other apps have some cool features, but OviaPregnancy is all around great. Cool trackers, different themes, and good advice. There’s even a medicine and food safety lookup. And for day’s I forget to take my prenatal, Ovia reminds me in the app! Also, Ovia’s week by week sizing seems the most accurate to what a doctor might tell you. Other apps I’ve used are all over the place with their sizes. Sometimes a week ahead or behind common size comparisons. I can’t believe this app is free. AMAZING. Used the regular Ovia app before getting pregnant, and I’ll be using the Ovia Parenthood app for when baby is here. Not sure if that’s that exact name, but I’m sure it’s an amazing app too!

                      Title: Flawed But Decent App
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I wish there were more theme options because I don’t seem to know hardly any of the things it is relating to the size of my baby in any of the themes. I wish that under medications it would let you put in a medication even if the system doesn’t notice it because they don’t have some of mine listed. Lastly, for sleep and activity it would be nice to be able to add the information in later because if you sync a Fitbit and wake up in the middle of the night it doesn’t record all of your sleep just that first part and the step count is rarely ever consistent with what I’ve got on my Fitbit. If we could go back in and change the wrong information it would be such a better app. I actually deleted the Fitbit sync because the wrong information drives me crazy. Developers definitely need to put in work to fix the concerns of the users but other than that it is a nice app and I like the way it is set up.

This is my second pregnancy and time using this app. Overall, it’s great! However, I wish the app would better customize when it asks you about certain conditions you might have (and you answer yes). I suffer from HG in my pregnancies and it’s s but disheartening to receive constant reminders about ‘morning sickness being normal’ or ‘should be over now’ or ‘even if you can’t eat, you should find ways to supplement anyway.’ If the app is smart enough to ask whether an expecting mom has HG, it would be nice to know that the app would use that information in its feeds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is THE best pregnancy app! I think I have downloaded just about all of them, and this I’ve outshines them all. On the calendar view page you can track pregnancy symptoms, moods, activities, record milestones, add doctor’s appointments + reminders, and create notes. There is charting functionality that pulls from the data entered on the calendar for weight gain/blood pressure/sleep/activity and more. There is also a wealth of articles and resources. The data you enter on the calendar creates a personalized feed on the homepage, which also includes baby’s daily development information. If you love data and tracking your pregnancy in a simple and extremely user-friendly app, but also want a wide variety of functions, this is the right one! Especially given that it is free! Compared to so many apps, the free functionality is completely awesome. Five stars!!

I’d been using the Ovia app for my period for years, so when I got pregnant I switched to the pregnancy app. It was so simple to use, and I loved the familiarity of the app having come from using their fertility app. The simplicity I think is what I really liked, simple but certainly enough! I loved the little images to show how big baby is compared to your hand or a seed per say. The little feet, it was a nice touch. I didn’t use the kick counter tbh because once I could feel my daughter kick, she basically never stopped moving. She was kicking so much it just didn’t make sense to try and record it all 😅. But anyways if you need the kick counter it works super great, and there’s all sorts of supportive and informational articles through the app that I appreciated. It helped me get my breast pump as well which was fantastic. Highly recommend!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have used this app for drs appointments and just tracking my pregnancy up until the day i gave birth to my sweet little boy!! I absolutely love that i was able to put my drs appts into the calendar and take notes in it. I would write my questions and concerns in the notes section and ask them at my next drs appt, it was just very helpful. I also love all the little facts they put in the timeline for how my son was developing in the womb and all the articles on pregnancy. I still use the pregnancy app for the articles and facts on the timeline for how he’s developing now in the world, i just wish they had the timeline with these facts and articles on the parenting app too. The parenting app is good too. I hope it gets updated though, so i can put his drs appt in the calendar and take notes to ask his drs, and then i can do the same for my son.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I tried a few different pregnancy apps and this is by far my favorite. You can see illustrations of your baby at different stages, check whether certain foods or medicines are safe during pregnancy, track your weight and symptoms,  post questions to a community forum of other Ovia users and so much more!  Every time I think, “I wish Ovia had this...” I find it seconds later, it’s so useful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app gives you daily updates as well as weekly updates about your baby and about your body. It tells you what to expect and It’s so accurate.  You see weekly illustrations of what the baby’s growing body looks like and also it has little growth charts of hands & feet as well. I check the app everyday because I love seeing the daily updates of how the baby is evolving. It’s really neat and informative. You can check updates from the weeks ahead which is nice because I like to be prepared and you can track everything. I put all my appointments in the calendar for this app. The calendar is also convenient because you can skip ahead to certain dates and it will tell you how far along you will be at that time. Love this app and can’t recommend it enough!

i tried all of the major pregnancy apps, and ovia is the only one i am still subscribed to and have on my phone at 8.5 months. all of the other apps constantly bombarded me with ads and click bait about the “10 things you’re eating that are harming your baby” or “5 things you need to stop doing NOW to have a healthy baby”. the ads were one thing, but the articles about what to do and not do on the other apps are often unsupported by medical literature. Ovia doesn’t try to give me anxiety about eating anything, shame me for not doing certain things, and doesn’t present me with information that is unsupported by doctors and the medical literature. i highly recommend this app for any mom that gets anxiety from all the click bait on the other apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ovia doesn’t necessarily have all the excitement of articles everyday, BUT they have so many other helpful tools that other apps don’t. For example, their forum is the easiest to use. They also have a KICK COUNTER, CONTRACTION TIMER, MEDICATION SAFETY LOOKUP, FOOD SAFETY LOOKUP, and SYMPTOM LOOKUP. You’d have to download several apps usually to get those things and it saves you so many calls to your doctor about simple things like allergies and what’s safe to take. It really has way more than the other apps. It shows how baby is growing and comparative size. You can also choose what you want size compared to, cute little animals, veggies and fruits, pastries, or random. It has the weekly updates and information for multiples too! I really loved this app and many women don’t even know all the features it has. :) totally worth it

I have used Ovia for all of my pregnancies! I’ve literally been using Ovia for years and have never tried a different app because this one is just so great and has everything I need. While pregnant I can check it daily for updates on my baby, tips and healthy food options, and can track how I’m feeling, my weight, exercise and so much more. It really helps when your foggy pregnancy brain forgets things or when it’s been a few years since you had a baby and just need a refresher. I also really love the food safety look up! I use it constantly. This is seriously a woman’s best friend during pregnancy. Also check out their fertility app (used that with two of my pregnancies) and they’re parenting app! I couldn’t recommend Ovia more!

I used the regular Ovia app not to track ovulation but only to track when I had my periods so I would know when it was coming, and understand when my moods would change during the cycle. When I marked I was pregnant (we weren’t really planning it but took a chance and it happens on the first try 😳), the app brought me to the ovia pregnancy app. I loaded it and found that it was even more fun and cute than the regular app. You can decide your background colors, post your picture, nickname your baby a fun name, even choose if you want the app to show you the size of your baby in bakery food references or fruit references, or some other reference. I like it. It give you info daily also about the growth and development of the baby.

The app itself has been great as far as telling me about my baby’s size and development! It’s so fun to see what weird animal she’s sizing up to and about how big her little hands and feet are....But I wish there was a way to add what kind of birth I’m having. Despite months of planning and preparing for what I considered a “normal birth,” I’ll be having a scheduled c section. This has been a pretty emotional thing for me to work through, and it would’ve been great to be able to select this type of birth as an option in the app and receive articles and insights regarding c sections. Getting daily notifications and articles about managing pain during labor and knowing when to go to the hospital has made this whole experience feel more isolating. I know c sections have gotten far more common, so I would request that you factor them in to the app and its content.

Like probably every new mom, I downloaded multiple apps when I found out I was expecting. Ovia was one of two that I actually kept. I love the daily facts and emails as well as the weekly updates with so much insightful information. The hand and foot growth pictures are just too cute along with the size of baby. Being able to track every symptom, doctor visit and special moment is super helpful (especially when you’re experiencing pregnancy brain). My only negative is that we decided not to know the sex so we didn’t choose one in the app however it referred to baby as she more often than he - it would help if it mixed it up in the same read or used “s/he”. Aside from that I love it and can’t wait to see what it offers post pregnancy

The information we get is great and I love how they use our baby’s nickname to personalize the information ! That is one of my favorite parts! Also I love how they introduced me to babylist ! That is one of the best things that happened in this pregnancy. Some of the information becomes a little mundane, and  when you do put in some of the moods, and symptoms the app don’t do much with that information, it does not keep a chart or anything like that. That’s the only thing that i see a problem with unless I am not using that part of the app properly. I also love that they introduced me to different websites that help you get breast pumps and other pregnancy accessories that insurance pays for. For example like, pregnancy compression socks, or belly band, the owlet, and breast pumps that are not available on other sites. Thanks God for this app.

I’m happy I randomly found this on Apple store this would so much more work and stressful trying to find everything this app provides in different places. This is a one stop shop! Keep up the great work guys. I can’t think of  anything that needs fixing. I would suggest maybe adding a hiccup counter. I placed mine yesterday under kick counter but I noticed this won’t work for that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m pregnant with my second and wanted to use the app to log this pregnancy like I did my first. The app has an option to “add another pregnancy” which I selected and added my new due date. I then tried to go back to my first pregnancy, since the app clearly said I was adding ANOTHER pregnancy and not replacing or changing the due date, but my first pregnancy had been deleted. I am extremely upset that all of my data is gone, I specifically wanted to use this app because I thought it would allow me to compare between pregnancies because I had complications with my first. I am devastated that all the information I so carefully logged while anxiously awaiting my first child is just gone, without ANY warning. At the very least, the app should very clearly warn users that their prior pregnancy will be deleted if they try to use it a second time, it is extremely misleading to call it “add another pregnancy” when it is in fact REPLACING the first.

I was using many different apps including Glow and Ovia was the only one that let me adjust and personalize it to my cycles and changes. Other apps keep going back to 28 cycle days even though you change it. I have cycles of 50 days so I needed an app that let me personalize and understood and tell me what would happen in those 50 days. Now using the pregnancy app is so easy and fun and gives me a lot of helpful tips. It also helps me personalize it to set the weeks and time as my doctor calculates and not self calculate it based on 28 days. I love it and am so grateful to have the app! Can't wait to get up each morning to see what it new with my baby!!

I love the ability to track daily stuff like emotions & symptoms in addition to food intake. I love seeing updates of baby’s size and a summary of what to expect each week.  The most impressive part has been the “health coach” that periodically sends a message about general pregnancy topics but then actually talks to me when I reply back and offers advice on any questions. It’s hard to believe this is a free app! So many wonderful features that have been a great help and comfort through my pregnancy. Thanks Ovia for this good service you offer!

One minor thing I would love to see, though, is the app keeping all of the photos that I post to keep track of my/baby’s growth. I don’t want to be the person who posts a new photo of myself on social media EVERY week, but I would love to still have the photos consolidated and saved somewhere so I can look back on them! So it would be awesome if there could be a feature that saves your progress photos each week. I know, I know, it’s a super nit-picky thing, which is why I still am giving the app 5 stars 💛

My only real issue is with the community posts. So many users post things that are completely unnecessary and unrelated to pregnancy. They like to vent about their personal problems and relationship drama. It’s a waste of our time! I’m currently expecting my third baby and I try to be helpful and encouraging to my fellow expectant mommies, but having to scroll through and read ridiculous posts about who knows what gets very annoying and therefore I removed a star. I wish this app could filter out the unnecessary posts and keep the topics pregnancy related only! Otherwise, great and useful app!

I had a miscarriage back in September and got pregnant again at the end of OctoberAnd this app has been a lifesaver. Not only can I track my babies growth but it also gives me tips and information I need on staying healthy both physically but also mentally and emotionally and it also gives me tips and gives me suggestions on what I could experience each week ofPregnancy so I’m not left in the dark I definitely will continue to use this for future pregnancies I love this app!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyperemesis is a condition that affects about 1-2% of pregnant women. Common, but rare. And every day the app shames HGers by asking us if we are taking our prenatal. Trust us, we’d love to take a prenatal and do pregnancy yoga and love the life, but taking a prenatal generally makes us vomit our stomach contents. Brushing our teeth, walking through a grocery store, daily life is already hard enough. We feel bad we can’t take the prenatal vitamin (which isn’t as necessary to baby health as NUTRITIONAL FOOD is, says the American Pregnancy Association.) But even knowing that we have HG, because the app asks, it still shames us every time we open it, we can’t use it without it being like the nagging parent going “you really need to take a prenatal.” I would, if I could, if it didn’t make me vomit everywhere. Thanks, Ovia, for shaming pregnant women when you’re aware already of their disability during pregnancy.

As soon as I found out I was pregnant I knew I wanted a cool app to keep track of everything. I found Ovia by just browsing through some of the top rated pregnancy apps and I absolutely love it. It’s such a fun and exciting way to keep track of your pregnancy with features such as a calendar to add doctor’s appointments, baby size/fruit comparisons each week, fun facts about baby’s development, and some incredible resources and articles. I’m nearing my due date and after using this app for the past 9 months I’d say I’m totally satisfied with what Ovia has to offer when it comes to following along with all the ups and downs of pregnancy and I’d recommend it to other women I know who are pregnant! It’s been a fun ride.

I am currently 25 weeks pregnant, and I just found this app, as I had been using others up until now. As soon as I opened it, and used it a couple times, I deleted all my other pregnancy apps. This one is by far the best! The videos are the most personable and relatable, and all of the information is presented in a fun and customized way! I especially love how they use your baby's name in everything they tell you! This app has SO much that the others don't, and it's a lot more relevant and modernized!! You won't need a handful of apps, just this one! I only wish I had found it at the beginning, but I look forward to using it for the rest of my pregnancy!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

So I used this app last year with my first child and I loved it. I downloaded three and this one was by far the most user friendly. It had everything I wanted right on my home page. I love tips and recipes and of course knowing where my baby is in development. However, I’m now pregnant with my second child and the app never works. It won’t open and it kicks me out often. I’m not sure what is going on. My phone is updated and has space so at this point I really think the app has a bug. I’ve stopped checking it because I won’t be able to access it for a week then all of a sudden it works and I’ve missed one of those weeks of development. I’m really disappointed with it at this point. Shame because it was one of the better pregnancy apps out there.

I used the regular ovia app for tracking my cycles & when I’m fertile. I struggled for years with a very harsh & unpredictable menstrual cycle. The app recommends so many different & helpful things to regulate your body or get to know it better. After about 6-7 months of using the regular Ovia app, I spent some alone time with my husband and found myself pregnant! These apps are amazing for every woman from every background. Happily tracking my baby’s growth, what to expect while my body changes & what to look out for as far as food & medications. It’s fun to involve my husband who is currently deployed! Makes things easier. Can’t thank the creators of this app enough for all of the help you’ve given us!

Love most things but its like all the other apps I've tried in one way. And that is that it assumes your having the baby in a hospital and have a doctor. I know home births are not super common but they are growing in popularity. This is my third baby and we decided to try using a midwife and having our baby at home. Id like to see more options for that and more articles. It’s probably a challenge because theres not a ton out there but having it incorporated would help me be more informed and that the information is also for me not just women with doctors and those giving birth in a hospital. I love the layout and options of this app though. Everything looks clean and well thought through. I really wish I tried this app much sooner!

It’s the cutest, most informative, and most easy-to-use pregnancy app. I tried many others, and kept coming back to this one. I used it way more religiously for the first 10 weeks, then slowly faded off as I became more and more comfortable with my pregnancy (: Now I use it for tracking my food intake, appointments, and the daily and weekly updates of how my baby is. The forum and posting segment of the app is great! Sometimes you get ladies who think they know everything, and will call you ABnormal or wrong for feeling what you’re feeling, but you just have to weed them out and look for the kind and helpful people. When I have issues or screws, they are always quickly answered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I really love this app. I like having the calendar and the option to input symptoms and notes. I really looked for that and didn’t find it in many others. However, this app doesn’t compile your information or anything, you have to go back through the calendar and find what you put on the entry that day. For instance, when I click on “My baby names” under “more”, I though it’d be a compiled list of names I’ve put into the app, but it’s a totally different function that gives you a list of popular names. Though I enjoy it, just isn’t what I thought it’d be. It’d also be great if notes were in there that way so I could just give my doc a run down of pains & occurrences I’ve kept track of or something. The notes app on the phone still works though but it’d be helpful in a dedicated app.

This app is easy to use and provides a lot of helpful information about each step of your pregnancy in a fun and understandable way. The ability to track data like your weight gain, your emotional and physical symptoms, as well as the special moments, such as the first time feeling baby kick, are so helpful, especially for a first pregnancy. I can not recommend this app enough — especially after having a minor issue as a result of a phone software update when I thought I had lost all of the last 8 months of data I had logged. The Ovuline Support Team jumped right in and helped me to get my account back up and running with nothing lost!

Honestly i really enjoyed this app when i first downloaded it.. it has good features! but it's a sad app to use when there's so many immature women using it too. This app is to help out other pregnant women with advice and things like that, there's a lot of shaming done here and jokes made about single mothers and first time moms that are unsure of certain things. I feel like this app should probably be monitored more closely.. since it's anonymous questions on the app people get so comfortable being rude and hurtful. Lots of bullying between the mothers and it's sad. I currently am going to retire this app and use "The Bump", or "Baby center" .. a better community .. would use this again when things are more monitored and people are punished for their rudeness. I really did like this app for a while though! just be aware ladies there's a lot of bullying here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I used this app for my last pregnancy(3 years ago) and loved it, so I was quick to download it again when we found out we were pregnant a second time. However, this time there seems to be less information about the pregnancy and fetal development, but significantly more plugs for connecting the app through your employer for insurance information. I understand how that could be helpful to some but not to all of us (we have Tricare for the military insurance and it won’t even recognize it). It seems like every-other article on my feed is a promo for how Ovia and your insurance can work together to improve your app experience, which ironically is taking away from mine. Not sure I’ll be using this as my primary app for this pregnancy, unfortunately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I really like this app but one this really has bothered me from the start. The references that are supposed to help you understand how big your baby is supposed to be are all strange. You can choose from weird and obscure vegetables that few people have heard of and give you no clue as to the size of your baby or you can choose from exotic/ rare animals that few people have heard of that also give you no clue about the size of your baby. The problem to me is am I receiving a lesson in obscure agriculture or zoology or am I trying to gain some concept as to the size of my human baby?  This strange feature has made me want to open the app less and just upset me every time.

It’s well organized and filled with tons of good info. I especially love the easy food and medication safety look ups! If I have one complaint though it’s that there isn’t a good place to upload weekly bump pictures. You can upload pictures but they aren’t easy to find again and it’s not like the other apps where you can click on which week it is and upload a picture there to keep them organized. I.e “week one pic” “week two pic” etc.

Every pregnancy I’m on the hunt for the right app to give me updates on my baby-mainly the veggie comparison and the weekly growth updates. At most, I would open the app once a week to check size but after the first trimester, it would lose its appeal. This app is so amazing that I check it everyday for its tiny one sentence updates on my baby’s growth. It asks me every morning if I took my prenatal the night before. It shows me baby size compared to baked goods, veggies, animals, and random stuff! The weekly growth updates are awesome and even have a multiples option if you’re having more than one baby! This app is seriously the best pregnancy app. 100% recommend.

I had already downloaded and had been using a different pregnancy app when a friend of mine recommended Ovia. I loved how much the app had to offer. Being able to easily check what foods are okay to eat and which are not is one of my favorite parts of the app. Also how you can customize the app to what you would like is great. I have a 7 year old step son and being able to compare the size of the baby to an animal instead of a fruit or vegetable is fun for him. The app also randomly post questions for you to make sure you’re staying on track with your prenatals and other things. I would recommend this app to others!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The app itself is great, gives kind of a visual on how big the baby should be, articles for each week, and you can ask questions to other moms. However I’ve noticed as a first time mom and other first time moms on there I have a ton of questions that others should be helpful and answer however there are a TON of RUDE people. Its to the point where it’s discouraging to a first time mom to even ask a question and not expect 5 rude answers in return. Definitely not worth it. Maybe they should monitor the comments better and when a person reports a rude comment block the person commenting from continuing to harass the person who reported it. If you are a first time mom and looking for answers to your questions I highly suggest going somewhere else unless you enjoy being talk down upon and rude responses. Deleting this app after this review because I can’t handle bullies. Sorry not sorry.

I used this app for the first 11 weeks, but found out shortly at my first appointment that I had a missed miscarried at 9 weeks sadly. So with that it really sucked but the app continues to go on as if your pregnancy is normal. Maybe they could add a tab that has options to put in you had a miscarriage. I know most people might just think well just delete the app but it actually wasn’t that easy to just delete after getting so excited, thinking you’d almost became a mom. But maybe this option can be put in place so miscarried moms can still see where the baby would of been at and where it stopped growing. Cause that loss was very hard, especially dealing with the what if’s.

This app is perfect! Every day it gives you advice on your pregnancy and how you’re feeling. You can also put dr’s appointments in, track health information, and look up certain medications to see if they are okay to take during your pregnancy. My favorite part is the community section. I spend hours a day posting and looking at post from woman all around. If I want to know something I can just post it and see if anyone can relate or has answers for whatever it may be. It also has a count down to how many weeks/days you have left. If you are looking for a good app look no further! I absolutely love having Ovia (:

How to hand nausea and morning sickness is the big thing now. Genetic test are talked about and there is an area to ask questions and give peer answers to other moms going through same things. I can’t wait to continue using this app till my baby arrives and see what is happening daily. You can track symptoms, doctors appointments, and more too.

As I go through my pregnancy, from the very beginning this app has been spot on! From the growth (compared to my OBGYN appts.) to what I’m feeling and the progress. My family loves getting the weekly updates and it’s so easy to screen shot the home page with your update and weeks. It’s so cute to see the tiny baby hands and feet as they grow to what a newborns “average” size comparison would be at birth. So tiny and sweet! Easy to log daily and check off that you are taking your pre-natal vitamin each day! I used the Ovia ovulation before this and was just as good, as we can tell - I’m pregnant! My husband and I are so excited for our first bundle of joy! Thanks Ovia!

It sets weight goals, sleep goals, and activity goals and helps ensure you’re your healthiest for you and your baby. I love the ability to jot down little notes, the medication safety lookup and the food safety lookup. There’s not a single thing about this app that I don’t enjoy or use to its fullest potential.

I like this app because I can track the size of my baby and other things. However my body reacted to pregnancy far different than I anticipated and although I am usually a very small girl and very athletic my body put on fat pretty quickly. Ovia constantly reminds you not to gain too much weight and to not eat too much etc. cut a woman some slack. I eat the recommended amounts and I work out all the time but I still have gained weight far differently than before I was pregnant. I deleted the weight tracker and it STILL asks me to log my weight. Every other article is about not gaining too much. We are all different in how much we gain ladies and no app needs to hound us constantly about how much we need. Maybe back off a little Ovia.

I love Ovia. I have used Ovia fertility which helped me conceive and now using Ovia pregnancy. I have to say I’ve been a fan of Ovia ever since my non pregnancy days. I love the layout, I love how they have a community section where you can read other people questions which definetly teaches you a lot also you can ur own question and get response right away. Trust me when ur a worried pregnant soon to be mommy u can’t wait for drs visit to ask any doubts sometimes u need that “it’s gng to be ok” type of feeling right away and Ovia community definetly helps with that.

This is my first pregnancy and I’m so excited. I downloaded every pregnancy app I could find and this one is, by far, my favorite. I love the easy health tracking, including mood, physical symptoms, medications, food and water intake, and even blood pressure! This will come in very handy at appointments. Oh! And the app helps you track appointments (and notes for the doctor) as well as pregnancy milestones (like telling your family). It even has a place to write in potential baby names. I love this app.

I really enjoy using this app. It’s really help me keep track of all the items I need to for my pregnancy. I wish that there was more options for someone having twins. I was only able to identify that I was having one child. In addition to keeping track of all the items that you eat it would be really helpful if it were identified as percents of protein or percent of iron and such as to how many cups of something I need to eat. Maybe this is already integrated into the app but I did not see that anywhere so I’m continuously trying to find that online and asking questions online.

One of my favorite features of this app is the “community” where you can ask questions and read other peoples questions with quick responses And vote on them. It’s fun, interesting and also helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I really like this pregnancy app, but it assumes that everything in your pregnancy is going perfectly. I have been nauseous and stuck in the house for my entire pregnancy. The articles aren’t targeted towards people who may be having a more difficult experience. Many of the articles have to do with recipes, listing ways to go out and have fun or pamper yourself....again, those things would be nice, but not every user has a glorious pregnancy. It would be neat if there were  settings options for people who have certain pregnancy complications, which would give this app a more customized feel.  I do enjoy reading the updates about the baby’s development and the app offers some informative tidbits.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

After my first missed period I knew I was pregnant. My sister told me about Ovia because she had used it for her last pregnancy. So I downloaded and it was so informative about every step of the way. Unfortunately I was not able to get to the doctor until 4months so Ovia was my only source of information of what was happening. When I finally was able to be seen, Ovia was right on the money with just how far along I was and even had the exact due date! I highly recommend this app to anyone who’s pregnant especially new mothers who want a lot of insight on what’s going on and things they should be doing.

When you haven’t had an anatomy scan to tell gender (for whatever reason), I feel the app should automatically use gender neutral terms, such as “baby” or “they/them/their”. Grammatically it is correct and it’s much better than the gender changing from week to week.

It has many different components in one app. It give you daily updates on what’s going on with the baby, how big it is, and what is important for you as the mother to do to make sure your baby can develop at its best. It gives you an area to explore names and it allows you to assort them in which ones you like love and don’t like. It gives you a checklist for you to have when leaving the hospital. It even allows you to speak with other pregnant women. Highly recommend. Would not recommend any other app for pregnant women.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Great app. I’ve used it for my first two pregnancies. This time around I’m having twins. I would like the app to recognize the difference and provide twin information but it does not. It also does not allow you to pick the gender of both babies and allows for only one nickname. Another thing I wish it did was keep a archive of the profile pictures you have used instead of just changing the picture to keep the progresss pictures of your pregnancy. I also wish it provided a picture of babies in the womb but twin pregnancy option not only singleton. Just some ideas for the next update. Other than that it’s nice app.

This app truly lets you keep track of and helps you remember everything you need to in pregnancy plus it tells you all the new things about your little one and it gives you fun creative comparison objects outside the normal fruits and veggies everyone compares baby size to, although that is an option in there too, the only thing I don’t love about the app is the forum community part but even that would get 3/5 stars from me.

This app has good info for each week and it has been so fun to be able to see what size my baby is each week and that you can choose the theme of what you want them to compare the size of your child to. This app is also very helpful because it reminds you to take prenatal vitamins and there is a place to put in all of the info/stats for each appointment do you can see your progression. I love this app!

I absolutely love this app and I love that I can keep track of not only weight and milestones but feelings and symptoms too. It makes it so easy to log everything. I can also connect my Fitbit to it to keep track of my steps and activities. I love that it gives you weekly sizes of the baby in 4 different groups. So it’s not only food but funny toys and animals too. It’s cute that it shows an actual size of the hand and foot on your screen for your weeks too. It’s just amazing.

Also cute images and little windows into how baby and you are doing week to week and fun articles to read. Lastly check out the food watch list on this app and you will always have an easy access list to remind you what is and is not safe to eat during pregnancy.

When I found out I was pregnant, I freaked out and had a ton of mixed emotions. That same day I downloaded OVIA and instantly felt so much more at peace. It is everything I need in one app to make sure I am tracking and considering everything I need to know and more in order to have a safe and healthy pregnancy. It helps you feel connected and form a bond with your baby from the very beginning by tracking every developmental milestone day by day.

This app is amazing if you stayed pregnant the entire time..... we had a miscarriage and this app will not let you record it in any way shape or form, this app doesn’t even acknowledge miscarriage which I find to be extremely frustrating. I want to continue to use this app for my next pregnancy but I just wish the creators would add a way to record a miscarriage. Because it allows you to record all the symptoms of a miscarriage and how you’re feeling but not that actual loss. So please add it in there. It would be extremely therapeutic. I loved this app through the pregnancy and I am going to use it again, but please add the option to report a pregnancy loss.

This is definitely the cutest pregnancy app I've used - it's fun and visually appealing. It also updates with new information every day, which is great! The app makes no adjustments, however, when you input that you're expecting twins or more. This is a major shortcoming compared to some other pregnancy apps, which offer better information in terms of symptoms, timeline, etc. for women carrying multiples. Some of the articles will have a quick aside "if you're expecting twins..." but the app as a whole fails to address the experience of a twin pregnancy. I'm not sure why they even bother asking you if you're expecting multiples?

I often found myself craving those foods a day or two before they would mention them, and their tips reinforced the idea that my body knew what it was doing and to trust my cravings. Love Ovia! I downloaded several other pregnancy apps just to try them all out, but Ovia Pregnancy has always been my favorite and is the one I always come back to. Thanks for being with me on this journey, Ovia!

The weekly size comparisons are adorable and help me connect with my son about the new baby. The medication and food lookups are awesome and very helpful. The only suggestion I have is to be able to save your own frequent medications, as you have to search daily if it’s not on the “most common” list, but that is a minor inconvenience. Overall, it’s exactly what I wanted in a pregnancy app and I’m glad I downloaded it.

A few things I would change: I wish they had a better baby bump photo feature (like the BabyCenter app) and a way to download all the information easily to store for future reference (and to show your baby when they are older). It’s also not very convenient for finding specific notes you made on the calendar. But overall, I used this app my whole pregnancy and was happy with it!

A lot of the early information references natural conception however so many people use IUI or IVF to achieve pregnancy. Could there be a way to put in your achieved your pregnancy using these methods and words tweaked for these couples- I can’t imagine that would be too difficult and it would be a lot more sensitive to a lot of women who have had a longer road to their pregnancy. Also after I reported an early pregnancy loss when I logged back in it still had the information from the previous pregnancy- which wasn’t fun to look.

I’m mostly enjoying this app, with a couple of exceptions.

This may just be annoying to me personally, who knows? I’ve also noticed that since I mentioned that I have experienced anxiety in the past, there is a huge focus on mental heath on my feed- I get including info on that once in awhile, but it’s excessive at times. Finally, occasionally I cannot locate the daily info about my baby’s development- it won’t show up until a day later, which seems like a glitch.

I read the weekly updates in addition to the free BabyCenter and What to Expect apps’ updates. The anonymous community is also a major and unique plus of this app! I would recommend this app to all pregnant women!

I also love all the resource articles that are included!

I just wish they had a quick reference tab or mark as favorite- for these types of topics to be easily found. If not, you have to try to recall where the article was and scroll to find it again. That would be a great update for the markers of this app. Other than that, I’ve enjoyed this app!

This is not my favorite pregnancy app. It IS the only one I use however because it is the easiest to navigate and the most accurate! It would be super neat if some more features were added, like being able to take baby bump pictures to keep track of “belly progress”, and more things for the community aspect. Make it to where we can add groups and such and feel more like a “community”.  While keeping the anonymous if anyone wants to use it. Just think that would be cool- either way, it’s a super good app and I would recommend to everybody

This app provides everything you need! It enables you to keep track of your nutrition, vitamins, doctors appointments and even has little reminders. I love how there are quick little articles on everything from where to buy a reasonable crib to how to deal with morning sickness. I also used the weekly nutritional tips based on baby’s development. This is my 3rd baby and I still learned a lot through this app. Great for first time moms and those who are more experienced. There is also a setting for if you’re having multiples as well! All in all 5 stars!

I’ve used Ovia for 4 years now with my first, then with my second, and with my third whom I gave birth to a couple days ago.. it’s such a great app! It asks if you’ve taken your prenatal pill, how baby’s development is and how you’re body is changing , the best for me is the community chat, you can ask questions , concerns, or just simply vent and other women around the world with Ovia can reply, all while being anonymous and it’s so great to know you’re not the only one who goes through certain things and get so much comfort and reassurance. I love Ovia, thank you so much ! I recommend it 1000%

Every week my husband and I read the fun things baby is the size of this week. I also really appreciate the mental health connector feature, the calendar where I can save pictures and notes, and the community section where I can ask questions to other moms. The only down side is that when you load a picture in the calendar and also a description, it loads really slow. Besides that, everything else is great!

When I got pregnant with my first child in 2018 I tried so many pregnancy tracking apps but I found that Ovia was the best one for me. I loved reading the info from the pregnancy by week part of the app and it was super easy to track my health. And all of the articles really helped for concerns that I might have had about my growing baby and gave me great things to ask my doctor about. I love the app so much that I used it for my second child and now I’m currently using it because I just found I was pregnant with my third so thanks Ovia for being an app I can count on

After I quit using the depo shot as birth control (highly recommend avoiding depo) I didn’t have a period for around 8 months. When my periods did start they were so irregular and were hard to track. Ovia made it so easy to track them until the regulated back out. Then when I got pregnant the pregnancy tracker was full of details about baby, my body, tips, healthy recipes, etc. The parenting app helped keep track of milestones my baby should be hitting. Overall I highly recommend these apps and have used them for all three of my pregnancies.

The accuracy of each stage, the weekly hand and foot prints of the actual size, the weekly videos, advice and guidance, things you didn’t consider that are helpful, insurance information, maternity leave information, dietary, contraction tracker, just to name a few. This is priceless information. Excellent resource and a flood gate of information. If I could if 10 stars I would. Hahaha

From the info week by week, little tidbits of info that is really interesting about the baby’s development, the ability to track so many different symptoms, milestones, appointments, ultrasound pictures, notes about anything like telling family/friends, baby bump pictures...it’s hands down the best!!!

Please look up the Washington Post article “Is your pregnancy app sharing your intimate data with your boss?” highlighting spevically how Ovia uses incentive programs to profit on sharing your most vulnerable details, including your sex life, menstrual cycles, & high risk pregnancy factors with both your employers and health insurance companies. The CEO of Ovia is quoted in the article saying that the women’s health crisis “is impacting the folks who are responsible for these outcomes—both financially and for the health of the members they’re accountable for.” Those are his own words in the belief that companies responsible for our health care need to keep a surveillance eye on what is happening with our own bodies and babies. I deleted my Ovia app and my pregnant & new moms groups are all outraged and doing the same. Boycott Ovia!!

I have downloaded and tried several different pregnancy apps, and I can definitely say this is by far my favorite. It is very helpful in many ways but unlike other pregnancy apps, this one updates daily with new information. As long as you refresh the page every once in a while, new information shows up. Other apps update weekly. But now that I’m on a review, if you want to see the actual development of your baby within the womb, “pregnancy+” has the best 3D photos of the fetus, your belly, and example sonograms.

The only way to end a pregnancy on the app is to report a birth… but what if you miscarry?? I miscarried my last baby at 15 weeks and there was no way to just delete the pregnancy without “reporting a birth” or un-installing the app. I did uninstall the app, but then I was still getting updates via email about a baby that was no longer there. I reinstalled for my next pregnancy and it still had all of the old info from the miscarriage front and center… harsh reminder when I finally got over it. I love the tracking features and articles/videos, but not every pregnancy works out and I feel like the app could be a little more sensitive to that.

I love this pregnancy app, it’s the best one I’ve found. It’s helpful to ask other women using the app my questions before I think something is wrong with me. The only reason this app isn’t getting five stars is because when I told the app I was having twins, nothing changed. It still acts as though I’m expecting one. It won’t let me put both genders in, and it doesn’t offer more twin information when I open the app. If I want to find out something about twin pregnancy I have to search for an article in the app. I do still love this app, and how user friendly it is. I definitely would recommend.

I always like reading the weekly update—the experiences/symptoms by week are always spot on! However, the medication list is extremely strict. I followed it closely with my first baby, but this time I’ve been checking with my doctor and found that he is a lot more lenient than the app—so always ask your doctor!! Sometimes I spot grammatical errors and typos. I’d be willing to proofread for them if they’d let me!! I love proofreading! 😉

Not going to lie I deleted this app because I became a first time mom and wanted some support and help. I had the Ovia period tracker and loved being able to talk to other women who were concerned about irregular periods and such. They were kind and understanding. However, once I fell pregnant I switched to the pregnancy version and couldn’t believe how nasty the women are! I would make posts about my concerns and struggles and in return I got bashed for being “stupid” and that I needed to “get over” what I was going though. I hate losing faith in humanity but apps like these make it super easy to happen. Download the app if you want tips on where you are in your pregnancy but stay away from the know-it-all parents.

I use the data side of the app daily and just love to check each week and see what size baby is now and how much their hand/feet have grown! It’s also a great resource to break the ice on some topics and read brief articles that then I can remind myself to write questions from for my appointments. I haven’t reached labor yet but I know the timers are going to be clutch!

I really love all the features that this app has to offer. I’ve been using it since I first discovered I was pregnant, over 6 months ago. But there is a major problem. It has deleted all my information twice now. The app icon will remain on my screen, but, when I click on it, it appears as though I don’t have an account. This is incredibly frustrating because each time now I have re-done everything and it takes a lot of time. I would enter in a lot of info to track everything in my pregnancy, and it just vanishes. This will now be the third time I’m “signing” up again. I don’t think I will because it’s too much of a hassle. Can Ovia fix this?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app will help track your pregnancy, though I prefer The Bump. The reason is that Ovia has lots of annoying bugs, one of which is the weight tracking feature which has been fully broken for several months. Very frustrating and they just won't fix it. It won't show me my past data (why did I bother entering it?) and there's no option to export. It also shows my weight trend as being outside the healthy zone even though it's been within the goal area. Worse though are the constant ads for breast pumps and cord blood banking. By the way, since most hospitals do delayed cord clamping, there is basically no need for cord blood banking. Enough of these ads. Seems misleading for a pregnancy app to confuse pregnant women with these ads.

I’ve used the Ovia Fertility and Ovia Pregnancy apps and the only thing I dislike about them is how they do not read from the Health app. Before trying to conceive and then becoming pregnant, I used plenty of health apps to track my fitness, weight, sleep and nutrition. Ovia doesn’t read from any of them so I end up using the Glow apps as well. If they could read and write to the Health app, I could abandon Glow completely and rely solely on Ovia like I want to. As this is the only issue I have with the app, I still highly recommend it for everyone, but with that small reservation.

I don’t really like that you can’t update your weeks and due date and last menstrual date manually without the other dates changing. I know when my last menstrual day was, but because the doctor told me a different due date and different weeks the app wants to change my last menstrual date too? It’s annoying because the information isn’t accurate anymore because the app is trying to tell me what is right when I know what’s right more than the app does. I also wish that they incorporated an accurate depiction of what the fetus looks like, like the Baby Center app does instead of a cartoon character fetus.

I’m a first time mom and prior to becoming pregnant I knew next to nothing about pregnancy, babies, etc. This app has been extremely helpful in giving me information on what to expect, what I might be experiencing, tracking my baby’s development, and other really important, need-to-know things. It’s so convenient because everything is all in one app, and it’s so easy to use! Ovia Pregnancy even gives you recipes and ideas about other awesome apps (Babylist - for your registry). I highly recommend this app!!!

I’ve just had my first embryo transfer and downloaded a slew of free pregnancy apps and this is the one for IVF moms. It gives you information and details and pictures starting as early as the day of your embryo transfer. Just google your IVF due date (I like using Flo website) and use that date to get it started! It’s also not spammed full of ads (although there are some.) It told me what was developing with embryo, when implantation should be taking place and completed, when I should be able to take a pregnancy test, etc.

I love the Ovia apps! I’ve used other apps to track my ovulation and no success. Every time I recorded anything in my daily notes, the app would keep changing my ovulation date and my whole Fertility window was off. I know because I was tracking my ovulation daily with clear blue electronic ovulation kit. Finally I came across Ovia and the dates as well as my fertile window were accurate. Now I’m using the Ovia pregnancy app and keeping track of everyday changes in my pregnancy. It’s easy to use and gives lots of helpful info daily.

I love the food lookup feature to see what’s safe and what’s not and the delivery countdown. I also really look forward to the weekly baby updates and description of what the baby may be doing. I check the app everyday honestly. The different articles are interesting too and tailored to fit you personally. Definitely recommend.

It successfully combines pregnancy advice with a safe medications and foods database. I can also personalize my baby’s growing journey by naming it and answering questions that let Ovia tailor my feed to what I need to know. It’s just a great app. And I love the daily emails telling me new things about my baby and new tips and tricks to make pregnancy better.

Being a first time mom this app has me knowing what to expect. I recommend all my friends to both apps for those that are trying and those who are pregnant.

Throughout my pregnancy I’ve tried a lot of different pregnancy apps but Ovia Pregnancy is the one I stuck with. I found myself always going to this one out of all the other ones because it’s easy to use, it’s fun and you can make it personal. I love how you can make a theme and early on change it according to the gender of your baby. This app is so informative and helpful in any way possible. The part I enjoyed the most though is watching baby’s foot and hand grow! Thanks for making this app so great.

This pregnancy app is wonderful. It takes you on a journey with your little one as they grow and keeps you updated on the things you should know/do during each phase of pregnancy. There are delivery aids such as a kick counter. I haven’t personally come to have any problems with it, just know their is adds on some things and they sometimes make it look important which can be frustrating if you don’t have access to the whole app.

And keeps track of how many weeks you are.  It also has a kick counter and contraction timer. It also can tell if you if certain medications are safe. I was recommended this app and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is pregnant.

I also agree with another persons review though as to why I gave the app 4 stars as after my due date I had no more articles or info to read and I was 9 days late!  It was something that I really looked forward too especially at the end.

Ovia is a perfect balance, with inspiring information as I tracked my food and activity intake, a helpful food safety and medication lookup, and articles relating to whatever pregnancy symptom or area you are worried about. Get Ovia, you precious momma, you!

What I look for in a pregnancy app is weekly development updates, growth patterns, and customizability and this app has all three! Exactly what I’ve been looking for. 100% recommended this app!

Even if I’m fast, I’m already 15-20 seconds into my contraction before I can get that feature to load. I would love to see that feature be more accessible since it’s such a matter of timing! I love everything else about the app, thank you Ovia!

I also used the edge park ad on the app for my FREE Medela breast pump so that was really helpful! I recommend this app for any first time mommy!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve downloaded a few different pregnancy tracking apps since I found out I was pregnant for the first time. Some of them focused on the hundreds of no no’s and awful things that can happen in pregnancy. They really causes me to stress about things I have no control over. Ovia is totally positive and reassuring. The community on there is quick to respond to your concerns and offers support to us over thinkers out there. I love the app and deleted all others!

I downloaded this app after using Ovia Fertility. It was so cool to see our little one grow. You can choose the theme so you can see it grow as a vegetable or cute animal, give the baby a name if you already have one, see the size of its hand and feet, and so much more! You make the app work for you by adding as much or as little information as possible. I loved the mood tracker, the different articles to read, and how the baby may look in an ultrasound!

I used the other Ovia app tracking my period and trying to conceive. I love how easy it is to use Ovia Pregnancy, and the plethora of information contained in the articles. I’m heavily disappointed how centered it is on breast feeding and natural delivery. Not every woman has those as options - me for example. No app out there that I’ve tried reflects on formula, c-sections, or any other anomalies that anatomy can cause during pregnancy. That being said, the drawings and variety of themes make the app so easy to customize and relate to your growing baby.

I love this app in terms of all of the information it has to offer about baby development and pregnancy symptoms. I also love the fact that most of the nutrition information and suggestions the app provides is actually pretty accurate and appropriate (As a Registered Dietitian this is important to me). I would probably give 5 stars but the app kept having add like stuff on my timeline and no matter how many times I hit the “hide” button and the “do not show similar items” button, it kept pulling them right back up.

I mostly use the app for the fun fruit analogies that I get every week.

I think it is good practice to reflect, at the end of the day, on how I felt during the previous 24 hours. I would recommend this app the other pregnant women, if nothing else for the helpful articles and the fun fruits that I like sending to my family to help them feel involved with my pregnancy.

I have used this app with all of my babies, I just like the way it is set up and how it looks etc. Easy to use and make sense. I would give five stars other than the community part of it where people chat. They obviously can’t control people but pregnancy is so hard and emotionally and sooooo many negative people on there commenting, trolling, and picking fights for no real reason. Just get rid of the chat part because people can’t choose to be kind or have any kind of moral standards towards others.

They have everything you need to track including moods, kicks, symptoms. They even have somewhere to look up your symptoms in case you’re worried about something. Another plus is that you can connect with other expecting moms by asking or answering questions. Would definitely recommend.

They thought of almost everything when creating the app. Kick counter, contraction timer, notes and milestones, a place for appointments, educational articles and videos. The only thing I would change about the app is to add a birth plan creator. I had to download a separate app for creating my birth plan which is no big deal. But it would be nice to keep everything together in one app. I love it!

                      Title: Almost perfect
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been juggling popular pregnancy apps for weeks - all missing something. Except Ovia! Everything you need is in the one app, without the extra fluff, easy to access. The only thing keeping this from being our *only* pregnancy app is the fact that the health data is write-only - the app does not read from your phone. That means if you want to track your activity, steps, weight, nutrition, etc then you need to manually enter these daily (no thanks). Download the app, you will love it, just realize you’ll need something extra.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The nutrition tracker can be improved a great deal. I would like to scan the barcodes and adjust the serving sizes of different food items to see if I am fulfilling my daily prenatal nutrition requirements & maintaining an healthy diet. There is currently no app that provides this support to the pregnant population. This would be a great update. Everything can be done on 1 app.. also providing daily recommended exercise routine would be ideal. I just find it easier to use 1 app vs several when striving to optimize my prenatal experience.

Now with my second, the updates have improved the experience even more and you can personalize it further to your preference which I like! Still look forward to those weekly developments and information. A must have for all momma’s.

If you’re struggling to find the right pregnancy app look no further! Ovia is awesome. I highly recommend it to new moms and moms who have been at it awhile. This is my second pregnancy and I have found this app to be extremely helpful and easy to use. I’m able to keep up with my weight, nutrition, blood pressure and more so I know what to bring up at my doctors appointments. Ovia has a great community of friendly people. Just a great app overall.

In the beginning, I found this app so helpful to discuss common symptoms of pregnancy and how the baby was changing weekly. By the end of pregnancy, there is less changing happening physically, and I wished the weekly updates were more informative regarding thinking about life after pregnancy - including topics like breastfeeding or sleep training. As a mom who is currently overdue, I bet many overdue moms would be happy if the app continued providing a bit of distraction in the final weeks!

Needless to say I always recommend this app to new moms or even second time moms it will make you feel better each day with new fun information.

It has great articles, recipes, tips, and weekly videos and updates. My friends and family love when I share the notifications about my baby’s growth from Ovia. I feel so supported from this app and I also got free samples of diapers, wipes, and baby clothes through Ovia. They also helped me get my registry started. Thanks Ovia.

Even keep track of appointments and it comes with reminders to take your prenatals! A great app I will use in future pregnancies I am sure! :)

Now that I’ve used a couple different pregnancy/parenting apps, Ovia has fallen to the bottom of my list as far as quality goes. I used Ovia with my first pregnancy, but with subsequent ones I’ve switched to apps that include both pregnancy and parenting support, so it’s a one stop shop for all my kids. Also I HATED the community forum. Women were so mean and petty, and most of the questions I tried to post didn’t receive any feedback. Comments frequently were deleted and the forum was not monitored well at all. Too much toxicity for such a joyful time of life. Better apps are out there.

Yes, yes I am. Stop it. Lol. Finally, add Reproductive Endocrinologist to the types of doctors we see.

I get that is the reality for a lot of women, but for someone who is hoping for a vaginal birth, it’s discouraging to be inundated with it everyday. I wish there were a feature to opt into the type of content you’d like to see based on your birth preferences because the constant c-section articles and information make me not want to log into the app to see updates on baby’s development. I’ve seen four c-section articles in the last three days. Ovia needs to diversify their content.

I found this app to be very informative and helpful on what kinds of things I could expect during pregnancy. I have now downloaded all three of the app the ovulation app, the pregnancy app and the parenting app and so far I have liked all three! I also really like the community tab, makes me feel a lot better to hear and see that other women are going through the same things. Overall good app!

When I was pregnant with my first, I downloaded at least 4 pregnancy apps.  Within just a couple month I had deleted all but this one. I loves the videos each week and the daily updates about how my little babe was developing.  It was exactly the information I craved with all the newness of the experience.

I was taking my vitamin every day just fine on my own, why are you just now annoying me with this when I’m already halfway through the pregnancy. I keep trying to find a way to disable it!

The best pregnancy app there is. Helps you every step of the way, keeps you organized and on track. Ovia is like my portable assistant. I log my doctor appointments, weight gain, food intake, and so much more. They share daily facts about the baby’s growth and what symptoms you should experience week by week. You even see your baby growing in your app just as it would in your tummy. This is my first pregnancy and I am super glad that I  choose Ovia.

There should either be more medications added, or a way to free type in medications not on the list.  Also, when searching for medications, many are long and get cut-off so you came read all the details.  Overall I do love this app, but wish a few more things could be applicable to my situation.

I just can’t believe that you can’t add multiple baby profiles.

Not only that, but it’s so cute that you can pick out various things to detail the stages of baby’s growth, and you get to pick out themes for the app. Overall, I love Ovia so far!

I feel I’m making the best choices when I can look up a food really quick! Love this app!

I really like this app, but I’m getting VERY SICK of it constantly logging me out instead of keeping me logged in all the time. There’s not any other apps where I have to log in every 2 weeks when I’m using it daily. Personal information being on the app is no excuse, as I can stay logged into Facebook/Instagram/or other pregnancy apps endlessly without ever having to log back in. ALSO, there’s no way to track twin pregnancies on here and in 2021 I cannot believe a coder hasn’t figured that out yet.

There is only one other app that lets you specify the gender, which in my opinion they should all allow you to put the gender on there so you feel it’s actually talking about your baby.

So I’ve relied on other pregnancy apps and general web for helpful information about breech babies.

Everyone has their own option but I just found this app very discouraging and overbearing. Also the sizes are off some weeks. If you’re wanting a positive pregnancy app that will not having you worry about things you shouldn’t be, this friends is not for you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app was by far my favorite during my pregnancy. I downloaded several that were recommended by friends but this one seemed so much more personalized. I would look forward to opening the app every morning, especially at the start of a new week. I also tracked all of my doctor appointments through the calendar. If we ever go for baby #3, I’ll definitely download again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app isn't bad. I've used ones in the past that offer wayyyy more insight but overall, it's a decent app. What disappoints me though is that there truly isn't a single app on the market either directed at women with multiples or at LEAST with the ability to customize for multiples within the app. I was hopeful that this would be the app for me since I liked the ovulation app but sadly, this one is no different from all the others. This twin momma would LOVE an app that acknowledged more than one baby!!!

I liked being able to track my weight. There were so many other things I could also track, but I didn’t find it needed for my pregnancy. I recommend this app for first time and any pregnant moms.

I love this app! However, I’d like to suggest they add the option to track a second pregnancy without sacrificing the tracking of the first. I’m now pregnant with our second child and I like referring back to my first pregnancy for week to week comparisons. However, the week tracker goes away when you add a new pregnancy. I wish I could see both! I used this app on a daily basis throughout my entire first pregnancy. I’ll likely be doing the same again!

It keeps saying my device does not meet ovia health high security standards. So bummed as I am at the end of my pregnancy and use this app to track kick counts, contractions, apts. In addition I’m active on the community chat. I’m keeping my fingers crossed I will be able to access app in the next few days, if not I suppose I’ll be finding a new one. 😔

They have weekly pregnancy videos as pregnancy progresses and to do lists to help stay on top of this.

I have had issues simply opening the app, it crashes 2 or 3 times before it will open- every time. I also think my tracking isn’t really talking to the rest of the content I’m receiving. I don’t see what I log or input making any difference. Basically I go between this and “the bump” app like a weekly/ sometimes daily newsletter.

Now it crashes no matter how many times I try to open it. This seems to be a common issue based on user reviews.

I like the app well enough, especially the ability to enter information about how the pregnancy is going, but I don’t like the inaccurate terms they use to describe the baby early on. At six weeks they say he/she’s a ‘human-being-to-be’. That’s biologically wrong. She’s a human in the early stages of development. I’m not carrying a chicken embryo that magically turns into a human when they look more like what we expect them to. Dehumanizing my baby doesn’t help me like this app more. I’d rather use The Bump.

And they helped me get pregnant much faster than without using the app. I had tried for over a year without the app. It only took a few months after downloading the app! I was more in tune with my body :) 5/5!

The articles and community gives so much insight and helps me to know that what I’m feeling is completely normal. 10/10 recommend this app to help track pregnancy.

This app has a tool that ensures I know what safe for baby. There’s also a good safety lookup. The only 1 thing I would change, is if the app had two representations of baby. One cute cartoon, and one very realistic 3 D interactive model.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Why does the app think that all women’s bodies work like machines?  We do not ALL ovulate exactly 12 days after the first day of our last period, so why is it when I put in the date I know I ovulated (based on test strips) it changes the first day of my last period? Any time I change one it automatically changes the other. It’s probably the pregnancy hormones talking, but treating women’s bodies like they all work like little identical clocks really irritates me.

You can communicate with other mamas if you have questions and you will be anonymous. The only app I have and it meets all my needs.

I really enjoy the ovia app and generally find it really helpful and fun! I was disappointed to see that the company partners with baby formula companies in their marketing - it is proven that these relationships decrease breastfeeding rates! It's why baby friendly hospitals don't give out formula samples anymore and use them only when there's a medical necessity or the mother makes the choice on her own.  It truly makes an impact. I would like to see the app support breastfeeding without competing commercial interests in their ads.

My complaint though is that the baby sizing it has with animals or food is super off. I don’t think it’s accurate at all. I’m thinking about switching apps just because of that because it annoys me so much, saying my baby is about 12” long now and then says it’s like an ear of corn or a guinea pig??? I’ve never had an ear of corn be a foot long or a guinea pig.

My husband and I both downloaded the app when we first found out I was pregnant. I was nervous about which app to chose as I’ve experienced losses. This app has been fantastic with education about the baby and the pregnancy. We both love the app and highly recommend it. The kick counter timer and food safety look up have been so helpful! 💞

I love the simplistic design similar to social media. You have all your body and baby updates plus some helpful articles if you’re struggling with mental health too. Also love how you can choose your own color theme and baby growth theme such as your baby is as big as a certain animal or toy. Lastly, I like how for the fact that it’s free you get so many features and updates.

I expect this to be even more awesome in my second and third trimester!

I was excited to use this app because I used Ovia when I was trying to get pregnant. At first, I really liked it. But once I downloaded other pregnancy applications I noticed the difference between this one and others. This one is either ahead or behind on the size of the baby compared to all other ones that state the same thing. Also, I feel this app does not provide as much information regarding the development of babies. I expected more.

Ovia is a really useful app for pregnancy. I probably only use a quarter of the features, but it is still a great tool for logging my food, looking up food safety, logging weight gain, and getting cute updates on baby’s development. I picked ovia because of the bakery size comparisons—some of which are totally bizarre, but that’s with fruit and animals too—and I’ve learned about some new French pastries.

When I found out I was pregnant I quickly searched the Apple store for a Baby app that’ll help guide me through pregnancy. Not only did Ovia do just that, it’s also very helpful after birth. My baby is almost 2 months and I check Ovia once a week for new updates and things to know about my body (inside and out) and my baby’s as well. Definitely worth five stars!

That to me is unnecessary stress which we don’t need.

I love this app! Everything about it is just so easy but in a good way. I love the reminders to see if I’ve been taking my prenatal vitamins as well as giving me updates on Bean and being able to track how i’m feeling and symptoms I may be experiencing. This is the first pregnancy I’ve been able to use this app for and so far it’s doing a great job!

Giving this app a 4 star because nothing is perfect and I’m not completely happy with it. Although, I’m still happy nonetheless. I have another app that shows computerized images of what baby should look like week by week. If this app had this feature I’d consider a 5. Other than that I love this app. One of my favorite features is that you can nickname the baby to whatever you like. :)

When I can open it, I love this app. I like seeing how big my baby is growing, and the updates on his development. Tracking symptoms is helpful and I like saving notes about milestones or questions for my doctor. The community section is usually hysterical. BUT it usually takes at least 15 attempts before the app will open, if it does at all. I’ll have to download another app when it comes time to track my contractions.

One week she’s a cauliflower: so when I’m in the market I’m looking to gauge my baby’s size, then the next week she’s a pineapple. That’s inconsistent and confusing.

I wish it showed what I may be missing in my diet in a day. But other than that I love using Ovia so far.

I’m only giving it 4 stars because I feel that on the section in your profile where you choose your baby’s gender, it needs to allow you to choose more than one for multiples. I’m pregnant with twins and have to leave the gender as “unknown” because it will only let you choose one or the other even though I have my pregnancy marked as twins. Other than that it’s a pretty great app.

Really really don’t need to be reminded every day that I am one of the “few” moms still sick. Please acknowledge the hyperemesis moms!

It has some cool features - you have different options to compare your baby’s size week to week and it shows the hand and foot comparison as your baby is growing. I don’t find the app that easy to navigate from week to week to get summaries (if you want to go to prior weeks you have to do a lot of scrolling and there’s a lot of junk along the way). What I mainly dislike is the language choice of saying “pregnant folks” it does not sound natural while reading and feels very impersonal.

Like every other app I’ve found, Ovia doesn’t have anything at all for multiples. You can’t even enter a second baby. Extremely disappointing. This would be a 5 star review if they would have had the sense to think about all the people out there who would love to be able to see little pictures of multiple fetuses and it would not have been difficult to do.

Some people write questions that have nothing to do with being pregnant and all you can do is "flag as inappropriate". The same for some answers within questions: you flag them, they disappear but when you reenter the thread, they are there again. Poor layout. Constant adds. The food and medication lookups are not accurate. You click on BLT and it says you shouldn't eat it because of the cold cuts--since when are cold cuts in a BLT? But it's in red, so don't eat it people! Smh I don't recommend this app to anyone, there are others that are better.

I found this app pretty annoying. Condescending gold stars, invasive quizzes, odd advice, constant ads, (Zumba? It must be sponsored), and was enrolled in unwanted emails without my consent. The contraction timer and kick counter seem useful but I’m not willing to put up with this for a few days of convenience at the end of the pregnancy, especially when there are better apps out there. Also there’s in an in-app button to “give this app 5 stars!” which is why I suspect the app ratings are inflated.

With all the controversy over Covid-19 and the rapid vaccination rollout, the push in the feed to get the vaccination and saying that it is safe when there are many pregnant patients who have received and miscarried within 2 days to a week after receiving the vaccination. Extremely sensitive topic and not enough known to be making recommendations. I also saw the flu vaccine info in the settings/account tab. These suggestions have made me question the information and recommendations in this app. I will be deleting it after using it for two of my pregnancies!

I ovulated late in my cycle which caused me to be 2 weeks off on my due date. My ultrasound dating confirmed the actual pregnancy age. I tried to update this on the app to reflect my doctor determined due date and date of conception but the app confined to make its own adjustments. It made my period a week later, due date a week earlier, etc and so on. Very frustrating especially when I know when my period started that month but the ovulation was just off. I will be finding a new app that is not so restrictive on dates.

I used this app with my first pregnancy and now with my second. I love this app, especially the references to your baby's size every week. It has tons of great information, products, and helpful hints that can be productive to your pregnancy. Also one of the easiest pregnancy apps I have ever used. Would definitely recommend it.

It has some neat features but slow to load and too many extra things. But the reason I finally just deleted it was because of the comparisons of things to the size of your baby. They were ridiculous! First, there’s too much variety in fruits and vegetables to compare them to a baby. The French bakery thing was cute, but not practical. The toy version wasn’t specific enough and weird animals not relatable.

Not going to lie, I use this app just to see which funny little animal matches my baby's size each week. I otherwise don't see this as standing out from any other baby app. This one will tell you little tidbits of info on what's happening with your baby each day, but only while scrolling past tons of ads (ads for products and ads for themselves- "Rate us 5 Stars" or "Share this app with a friend"!).

I like this app it has some great features but I was disappointed it didn’t have more options for other issues during pregnancy. I have placenta acreata and was hoping to add it but they only seem to have placenta previa. With placenta acreata you deliver sooner so I’d like to see that option on the app so I don’t have to do the calculations all the time on how many weeks I have left.  Also the app is a little difficult to navigate.

I am on my 9th month of pregnancy now, very anxious to finally meet my baby girl. The app helped me prepare myself for the day she finally arrives and on top of that, I also stumble upon articles that discusses simple things i didn't really care about before but are actually necessary: gift registry items, how to order feee pump though your insurance, etc.

I loved the app for my first two pregnancies, but this morning I was woken up by my ex-husband congratulating me on my pregnancy. I feel slightly violated and wish there was something that prompted the user to ask if their information was still correct. Especially in situations like these where certain things may not be shared with others for an array of reasons. I am now extremely anxious and uncomfortable knowing an intimate event has now been shared with someone who I do not feel safe knowing that information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The app stops providing a lot of helpful information at a certain point in the third trimester. Just a lot of “baby is continuing to get bigger” (...obviously...). Also the size comparisons are bizarre. I’m 37 weeks and it says he’s the size of a tackle box or a honey dew melon, which don’t seem comparable. Finally, Gina’s weekly chats are like a cheese grater on my nerves, and they aren’t relevant during COVID. Oh, treat myself to a pedicure Gina? Thanks for the crap advice.

I love Ovia. I’ve used it for every pregnancy & I use the Fertility app to track my period. However, since they add the “In the Womb” feature the app is slow, laggy, and rendered unusable if you attempt to view your week in the womb. I’ll give more stars I’ve the bugs are fixed and the app improves, but at this point I’m already looking for a different app to track the rest of my pregnancy.

It’s a great app except in the baby development section, about 2/3 of the time they use the pronouns she/her and the other 1/3 they use he/him. It’s just very inconsistent and I feel like they could use gender neutral pronouns until a gender is plugged into the app. This is definitely an area that needs improvement.

since I’ve got pregnant OVIA PREGNANCY had been my best friend , It’s an amazing app which gave me all what I need to know about my baby development and my body’s too since the first day of pregnancy, Also the food and medicine safety lookup was fascinating  I truly recommend it for every pregnant woman as a reference for her in her pregnancy trip!!

The Ovia app has been spot on with symptoms. As a first time Mom it is good to have Ovia at my fingertips to read when I wake in the morning. My husband asks every morning “What’s baby doing today?” And just having small updates can keep you positive when you might be feeling very good.

The latest article about involving the partner starts out great. Encouraging them to attend appointments and birthing classes is perfect. But then discussing how even if your partner has a full time job remind them that the baby is as much their responsibility as yours? That smacks of the birth parent (i.e. Mom) staying at home while the other brings home the paycheck. Some choose that life, others don't. It's 2018 time for a rewrite.

I learned of this app from my cousin who has 2 children. This is my first and the app has been spot on every week. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because THE BUMP has this 3D imaging where you can SEE the baby’s progression and I’m a very visual person. So not every app has everything you want but its still a great tool to use.

This is the best pregnancy app I’ve seen (way better than The Bump), however, I am not a fan of the overly personal medical questions that intrusively pop up each time I open the app. I don’t need to share any medical information with a pregnancy app, thanks. That’s why I have doctors. There are already plenty of ads littering the home screen (understandably), but these questions are too much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I used Ovia until I found out we were having twins. Ovia offers an option to select “twins” in the settings, yet proceeds to refer to your “baby” as a singleton and does not acknowledge both babies. It also provides zero new information on twin pregnancy and does not discuss multiples in any way after selecting twins.. disappointing. Maybe they need to update? Maybe they need a different app for twins? Unfortunately, it seems like Ovia is not concerned about multiples.

This app is functional, but I like others better that have more realistic videos of what the baby looks like in the womb, instead of just a yellow cartoon baby like Ovia has. This app also has absolutely no support for home birth, if it’s mentioned, it’s basically an after thought like “oh, some people do this.” All in all, it’s okay. Gives you information.

I just found out that I am pregnant and was excited to start using this app. Unfortunately, the app automatically refers to my baby as HE and HIM. Considering what is going on in the world and that pregnancy should be female centered, this was quite disappointing. I hope they change pronouns to THEY and THEM until I have the information to select a gender for my baby. Until that change is made, I won’t be using this app.

Love this app though, it’s been so useful and my favorite one to use throughout my pregnancy!

From now on I will use the app just to check on my baby’s development and to read the articles. Any questions I have I will ask my doctor or someone I know who has kids because the moms I see on that app are rude and don’t deserve kids. Just being honest.

One of the best pregnancy apps out there. I love the color and design. The ease of use is great. BUT all the ads are for formula. Not the best option, a good one if you need to, but not the healthiest option. I’m insulted that any app would promote formula by letting so many sponsored ads for formula be all over. Healthy, informed decisions are important during pregnancy. An app shouldn’t dictate or influence away from breastfeeding...

I had Ovia with my first pregnancy and loved that I could use it to track Dr appointments, weight, blood pressure, etc. So when I found out I’m pregnant again, it was the first app I downloaded. Unfortunately it has been updated and now only works with WiFi, so I can’t just put in my info at Dr visits anymore. And I can’t access it anywhere but at home, which defeats the purpose. It’s pretty much useless to me now.

It never told me it would erase anything, just gave me the option to add. I’m not sure I’ve ever been this upset. There should be a warning because I lost precious information I’ll never get back 😭😭😭

I’ve actually been issuing Ovia for a while, I was using the fertility app to track my ovulation which helped my husband & I get pregnant! So of course my first choice was to use the Ovia pregnancy app. I love both, they’re both easy to use & it makes it fun to input info daily!

This is my first baby and I have loved using this app to track how big baby is and reading all the articles it provides is honestly just a big help. Definitely an app I would recommend for your pregnancy.

I habitually checked the app everyday to get fun little it’s bits, however I’m not 38 weeks and I’ve known my baby is a boy since week 22.  It still refers to “her” which makes it way less personal and I’m honestly annoyed by it now.  Why is there not a “milestone” to have the developers change girl to boy or visa versa after you’ve found out the sex!

As a second time mom the only reason I use the app is to see what cute things my baby is the size of. Each week my baby seems to grow and then shrink based on the random and inaccurate comparisons...but still fun. The advice is pretty laughable. For example week 39 says the first year of baby’s life will probably be hard because they will cry so much but they will be cute.....how is this helpful?!
