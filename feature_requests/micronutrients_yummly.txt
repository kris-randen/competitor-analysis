When I get annoyed I begin to look at alternatives.

                      Title: Best Cooking Database
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Great app! This app is my favorite. It‚Äôs awesome for individuals either looking to follow a particular diet (keto, low sodium, etc.) or just have other parameters or restrictions they need to adhere to. As opposed to vaguely browsing a search engine for something that stands out, this app makes it easy for me to say, ‚ÄúHey! I want chicken with cilantro but I only have 30 minutes or less‚Äù. Furthermore, seeing how many people have liked the recipe and being able to easily adjust the serving size is another plus. And I can‚Äôt forget about the ability to easily save and organize recipes that have interested me. I recommend this app to everyone! There are even drink recipes as well.

                      Title: Finding good foods to eat finally!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am probably the worlds pickiest eater. Because of that I have a hard time finding new foods to eat and I get sick of the same things over and over. I decided to take some chances on internet sights and YUM is the best place I‚Äôve found so far! I love the potato, ham, corn chowder! It‚Äôs so good! And the ground beef minestrone soup and stuffed cabbage, truly yummy!!! I make meals a couple of months in advance and freeze them. It is so nice to just pull the out, heat them in the microwave, add a salad or fruit, or a muffin or some kind of bread ‚Äî try the banana bread with the streusel, it is to die for!! Everything I have made has frozen nicely and tasted just as good after thawed and reheated! Love this site!

This foodie app is just the berries for my heart friendly meal plans. I love the fact that it comes up with recipes according to my food choices. Build your own grocery list too. There are so many great recipe apps at my finger tips but this is the only one so far that I can find recipes that are little-no fat, low-no sodium, a sugar alternative, make my ‚Äúheart happy‚Äù recipes. There‚Äôs a whole world out there of heart friendly meals & I believe I‚Äôve finally found the jackpot of food choices for my meal plans. I definitely would recommend this YUM App. I give it ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è & a üëç!

                      Title: Annoying App
--------------------------------------------------------------------

First, I love Yummly and routinely use their recipes that I find online. Today, I downloaded the app and it is so annoying, 8m going to remove it! When I tell you once that I‚Äôm not interested in Yummly Pro, it should not pop up every time I click on a recipe. When I click on a recipe, I just want to see that recipe. Period. This app seems to be trying to give me everything but the recipe I‚Äôm trying to get to. I can eventually get the recipe, but it takes persistence. Other recipe apps are much less cumbersome to use. Trying to use on an iPad Pro, updated with the latest software.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

My husband has congestive heart failure, so I‚Äôm cooking fresh food for us, only without the salt. Yummly has proved invaluable in finding flavorful recipes without all the sodium (if there is salt in the recipe I just omit it). It‚Äôs worth it for the pan-seared tuna steak recipe alone! It‚Äôs not a dedicated ‚Äúlow sodium‚Äù app but it‚Äôs really good for finding quick and flavorful meals.

I would likfe the dishes that are listed for me didn't have or list what I said I can't eat have or dislike. Or if they had other ingredients listed for substituting or omitting them all together.

I used the app for a couple of days, thought it was pretty sweet that you can make a shopping list from your saved recipes, but wished I could hide recipes with high sodium/millions of calories... So I send support some feedback thinking maybe if enough people suggested it they might change things in the future. Turns out I'm just an idiot. They emailed me back the same day and told me where the filters were, right under the search function. I says to myself, "well that's nice, but I'll bet you don't have one for slow cookers, or prep time..." Open up the app and check it out, shazam; filter by fat, cholesterol, calories, cooking methods, prep time, carbs, salt, bitterness, sweetness, meal course, what tv show it pairs with, you get the idea. They've thought of it all. Just quit reading this and get the app already. It's good.
