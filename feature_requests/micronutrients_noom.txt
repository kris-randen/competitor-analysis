                      Title: Good program, but has some issues.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am now going into my fifth week with Noom.  I find it to be a good overall concept and I have learned many things about myself, and about nutrition, and human nature, but am I losing weight?  Not much, but I do plan to stay with the program for at least another month.  While I feel that the basic concept is sound, there are some issues that need adjusting.  (1) The program’s daily lessons are centered around a working woman’s or man’s environment, i.e. office , co-workers, break room, etc.  They don’t seem to realize that there are those of us who have left this part of our lives behind and moved on, or, there doesn’t seem to be any appropriate material for a stay-at-home mom or dad, or for any other younger, or older persons out of this working” category.  This hard for me to follow.  (2) They tout one-on-one attention, and, truly, you are given a food coach, assigned to a group, and given a group coach as well.  However, I’m not sure that these coaches are not bots.  Asked questions sometimes are not answered for 24-48 hours (and never on a weekend).  When they are answered, they are impersonal and often do not apply to the real situation at hand.  I do think that this customer service aspect could be improved, or, strike the personal touch from the app advertising.  In short, is this a good program?  Yes, but if you want quicker weight loss and personal attention, I would take my business to Weight Watchers.

                      Title: Approach With a Healthy Mindset
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have Noom incredibly helpful for me. The app eases you into its program and each day gives you different tools to see the habits you have accepted as facts in your life. One of the best parts of the app is that it admits that there is no one size fits all path to weight loss. It even admits that the amount of weight you think you should lose might not be what best suits your lifestyle. Sometimes I find that the app throws so many ideas at you that it can be difficult at first to know which goals you should be setting each week and which things to focus on. But sticking with it definitely helps. Eventually you start to notice your own patterns, how much the app and its functions help you proceed to where you want to get to, and which parts of the app you can maybe disregard or save for another time. Caveat: I used the app in 2019, lost weight then traveled, stopped using it and gained it all back. I am back on Noom in quarantine knowing that one of the flaws I have found with Noom (and this just might be me personally) is that it is really successful when I’m in full control of my environment, but can be less so when that control decreases. This is something I’m still working on but hoping that with the help of my goal specialist and group I can push through. Noom has helped me lose 12 pounds and 2 inches off of my waist. But, more importantly, it has helped me change certain habits around food.

                      Title: A real review, from someone who rarely posts reviews
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Simply put: I was a total skeptic, as my experience of these things is that they are both expensive and rarely work. Big surprise: Noom really does work. I’ve been on it for about 6 weeks and have already lost 5 pounds, and it has never felt like a chore, a burden. or a project. And this occurred with my 50th birthday AND Thanksgiving in the middle, folks. Wow. Just gradual, natural, and healthy. I’ve formed new and better eating habits, am far better at balancing the types of food I eat, and have gotten past several (inevitable) low periods with the help of my coach and Noom’s cognitive behavior-changing content - which is really fun and life-affirming to read, I promise you. Best moment: when I asked the coach if I could slip in a dose of my favorite French toast every so often and she replied, “Are you kidding? Of course! It’s all about moderation!” It’s lovely to hear that from someone other than myself - and I enjoyed every bite, and then went right back to my regular habits. Didn’t have any regrets, didn’t start craving more. Bottom line: most apps/plans target only one or two pieces of the puzzle. Noom is an end-to-end strategy put into practice, that really helps you learn how to become healthier - while enjoying it! I rarely write reviews, but these guys deserve a great one. Thanks, Noom!

                      Title: Great until it’s not
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I loved Noom through the first month. I actually lost 9 lbs and felt like I was finally on my way to weight loss. It’s now been nearly three months and I haven’t lost any more weight. Obviously I am responsible for my self control, but Noom doesn’t provide a system to make you feel back on track once you get off track. First, they send you 5-6 articles a day which get to be exhausting over a long period. Many articles build on each other so if you miss three or four days then you will see references from previous articles you won’t understand unless you go digging through those that you missed. When you’re struggling to revive motivation, becoming weighed down by information is not helpful. Second, the weight loss coaches are amateur. I’ve had two now and I’ve had the same issues with both: very slow response time and unhelpful advice. For response timing, I’ve waited as much as five days for a response to a simple question. As for the content of the advice, it’s mostly questions in a Socratic form or stuff that is already heavily hit on in the articles. If I ask a question, 90% of the responses are another question. “What can I do to stop my junk food cravings?” “Well, what are some habits you could form to avoid craving junk?” If I could answer that question, I wouldn’t have asked. I appreciate the system for what it is, but I did pay a lot of money to get the program.

                      Title: Mediocre and not worth the price.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been using another app to monitor my macros and exercise for some time. I was having weight issues because of the humidity and swelling and no continued weight loss. It’s imperative I don’t gain weight as I’m an amputee and device fit is essential. What I discovered was it was environmental and plateau. My weight went up. It was muscular as my clothes did not fit any differently. My device didn’t fit good. That was weather and exercise related. It was hot and humid. I was doing interval training 5 days a week combined with biking. So when the weather changed everything changed and the plateau broke. My diet really remained the same. My devices began fitting the way they should fit once the humidity and temp dropped.

                      Title: Worth its weight (pun intended)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am so grateful to have found Noom! It is technically a weight-loss program, but it is more of a sustainable, life-changing program. It has taught me more about how I think about myself, my relationship with food, the physiological things in my body that impact my choices about eating and helped me be more aware of the environmental influences the influence my choices. Aside from the initial cost, the only investment I have made is my time and attention. I am the mother of seven, working, and finding time for anything as hard. Because of the simplicity/completeness of the app, I don’t feel like I am wasting my time at all. This isn’t something that I will have to be connected to forever because the whole goal is to teach us all how to do it on our own instead of getting us reliant on a program.

                      Title: **this program auto renews**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

First, let me say that I did lose weight. I lost about 10lbs. However, the app AND “support” does not live up to the promises. The coaching and goal-setting were the main reasons I signed up and I felt like the coaching was minimal and they did not help set SMART goals or have any way of tracking them. The group coaches did NOT keep people engaged and did not do a very good job of explaining how to use certain features. Overall, the coaching was poor. For the money, which is about the same as weight watchers, I expected more. There are a ton of free apps that allow you to track macronutrients and activity, this was no different. I also felt like there was a bit of information overload with the coursework. I have PhD level education and with a typical “busy mom” lifestyle it was a tad time intensive and was a lot of information to try to retain over a short period. All of that aside, the part that really bothered me was the auto-renewal. When I side up it seemed if i would have only the initial 12-14 weeks and that if I wanted to continue, which I didn’t, I would have the opportunity to self-renew. I really despise programs like this that even have an auto renew as the default. It’s really dishonest and I feel like i should have been given my money back for the auto renewal period, which I did not use. I was not. Over all I would advise anyone to proceed with caution.

                      Title: Frustratingly glitchy
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m super on board with the concept of psychology and health/diet but this has been exceedingly frustrating to use. Glitches nonstop, and it’s nearly impossible to figure out how to use it, what you subscription includes, and I keep getting emails like “we noticed you haven’t logged into Noom yet” even though I’ve been actively using it every day. And somehow you need to tell the Noom bot “I’m done” in order to get set up with your goal specialist. How on earth would anyone know to do that??? Done with what exactly? It’s totally unclear. I only found out because I had a long discussion with support as I was so confused. And now I’m getting notifications from my goal specialist that don’t actually appear in my messages. This app is a hot mess. Are the other reviews fake? There’s so many five star reviews and I have no idea how no one else has encountered this problem. Also, they won’t let you get set up with your group or group leader until after 3 weeks, which is sneakily after the trial period. I’m continuing in the hopes that this will be worth the daily frustrations, but please please improve your user experience. I’m happy to provide more specific feedback if that helps. But for a relatively high priced app that has been around a while, I expect to not have to deal with basic errors like this.

I did the free trial, wasn’t planning on giving my payment info but they suggested a donation for the free trial so I thought sure, why not. I was waiting for an indication that my trial was ending and an explanation of pricing...I had no idea how much it cost after the free trial. Turns out, it costs a lot! $100! I noticed they charged my card, I canceled immediately while the charge was still pending, but after contacting support in a panic and a rage I got an automated email saying I couldn’t get a refund because I didn’t cancel during the trial period. I was infuriated and felt violated and I sent them a Facebook message saying so. The next day I received an apology and a refund and so all was well and I didn’t need to be so dramatic. But I do wish the info was easier to find because I had looked for it at the beginning.

Really enjoyed Noom for the first month or so, but once you get passed the initial free period and maybe a week or so after they charge you, the audio quality drops dramatically. They obviously paid voice actors for the first month of courses, and then after they use people who just sound bored, read from a script, and are very monotone.

                      Title: Try it!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve only been on Noom for a week, as a trial period. I consider myself knowledgeable as far as my health goes. However, I’ve hit a road block into my long term goals(diet, exercise, life style change) Starting Noom, was exactly what I needed to slow me down and become more mindful to the whole process of changing my lifestyle. It’s informational, educational, structured(logging weight, meals, calories, exercise)and motivating. My everyday routine was getting boring and I hit a plateau. Even though I was exercising rigorously everyday, and eating a lot of healthy calories(for energy), I wasn’t taking off the extra weight I needed to lose. Although, I know that burning more calories than I’m consuming will help me to lose weight, I didn’t realize I was still consuming too many. With Noom, I was able to restructure my meal plans. I’m on the app first thing in the morning, and I follow the steps. Weighing in for starters. I look  forward to logging my meals, staying mindful and understanding my triggers and eating style. It’s only been a week, and I’ve already started losing weight! Onto my next week and I can’t wait!

                      Title: Expensive - there are better apps for this
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I recommend Lose It as a way better alternative to this app. Lose It is free to try as long as you want and it offers an upgrade to premium at a much lower cost than Noom. The food entry is much better in Lose It than Noom. I find Noom’s food entry confusing. It’s not clear when you’ve added a food. They need a clearer interface. Also, I could not cancel after I realized I’d gone past the trial period. I know it’s my fault for signing up without reading the fine print but I hadn’t yet started using the app and they refused to refund me - so if you choose to use this app beyond the trial, know that you are signing up for $150 for only 6 months. Lose it is $40 for a whole year and I don’t even think the premium version is necessary. The free version is better than Noom. It’s also unclear whether the Noom concierge is a real human or AI. The unresponsiveness makes me think human, but the canned answers to my questions make me think it’s an AI. It has not answered my question asking if it’s a human or AI (another check in the AI column.) The metabolism and nutrition info are not unique enough to justify the price - It’s information readily available for free on the internet.

                      Title: Noom is a wonderful program!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have tried many successful weight loss programs and supplements. Noom is different because it teaches the physiological (hormone changes, fat storing and burning processes, and proper dietary necessities) and how the body reacts psychologically to the changes in your diet which alters your attitude and all around mental image of yourself. You are given awareness as to how others around you affect your diet and how to combat the stressful eating environment around you. The coaches you work with are awesome and the community you work with inside the noom application gives you inspiration and support. So far I have been using Noom about a month I started with my weight at 326 lbs and in thirty days I have now weighed in this morning at 306 lbs. That is great! I feel wonderful! Noom helps you loose the weight in a steady downward process giving you lasting results with a dietary understanding and application to continue to succeed. If you struggle with your weight, with depression from your weight, and want to change with  success, then like me Noom will definitely help you. Give Noom a try!

                      Title: Customer service is useless. They canceled my subscription for no reason.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

So incredibly unhappy with this app/company. Literally never written a review on the app store before, but this was an experience unlike any other. I was really excited to start - chatting with my coach the first few days, and then I asked her a question about the program that she didn't know the answer to, (which was totally understandable) so she recommended I email customer service. I did right away (this was day three of my first week). The following morning, I had an automated email response canceling my account. I freaked out and contacted the "was this a mistake?" Link on the cancel email, and sent a message to my coach. She apologized and told me I should contact the customer support line (again). So I did. Three emails and two "contact us" submissions later, I never heard back from them (Other than 5 automated - "we received your message and will get back to you shortly" messages). This started 6 days ago. My account has now been canceled, and I have no way to access my coach or continue the trial period. And to think - I was already planning on continuing on and paying this company the $130 for my next three months. Glad their horrid customer service became apparent before my trial period ended.

                      Title: Weight loss Marketing at its finest
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, this is a collection of basic health monitoring tools hubbed in a micro transaction web. They offer ‘coaching’ for the PAID trial period. Which means one hollow text message a day from a random person. And then the rest is prefabricated and typo ridden cognitive thinking articles based around food habits. Unless you’re a lazy glutton this app doesn’t have a culture for you. Additionally the 150$+ weight loss plan doesn’t contain exercise or food guidance. Those are an additional fee. It’s as if someone took the AA method and wrapped it around a lifestyle coach. I suppose there’s an audience for this. But I am not it. And I would have appreciated knowing what it was up front instead of feeling like I was being sold yet another useless health subscription. Just more wasted effort to add to the pile. If you enjoy being talked down to like a child and offered hollow psychology this is the weight loss app for you. I also love that I had to MESSAGE them to cancel my subscription, which, for the record, circumvents the App Store system. Which I’m fairly sure is against Apple’s TOS. I’m very very disappointed. Queue hollow developer response in... 3...2...1...

I’m just into week 5. The first two weeks were the trial and while I wasn’t completely sold, I knew I was getting information that would change my relationship with food. You get a lot more after the trial period. It isn’t easy, it isn’t a fad, it generally isn’t quick weight loss, if that’s what you’re looking for. However, I believe if you stick with Noom you will change your life for the long haul.

Using this and really liking it! I’m not getting anything for saying that... just being honest. Changing my whole mindset and helping me to eat and live mindfully when it comes to my health. I’m down a little over 13 pounds in 4 weeks. My husband is down almost 20 in that same period. (I hate his ability to do that! 🤪) Honestly haven’t incorporated working out yet but I do get my daily steps in. (Just normal walking around during the day.) Don’t have to give anything up... if I really want it... but I’m learning to eat mindfully. I also haven’t been hungry once. I highly recommend it. Every plan is catered to your specific info and goals. My husband will meet his goal early this summer. Mine is hopefully by September. Just passing this info on for anyone who doesn’t do well in extreme giving up of things and/or doesn’t like being in an upline/downline selling model. It’s none of that. Just an app and some other support that helps you with psych tricks and mind changing for an overall lifestyle change. 😁🙌❤️

                      Title: Food logging made easy
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m currently in the two week trial period but already seeing steady weight loss. I wanted to compliment the app developers for making food logging easy. I’ve always felt that process was a pain but they’ve done it right. They have many different measurements to select from when adding foods. I have yet to search for something that they don’t have in their options which is impressive! Things like beef bulgogi, chicken khao soi, and Kerala mix? They’ve got ‘em! Also when you add foods it will auto-sort to the tip any past foods that you ate with that food previously. For instance: I select pork sausage patties and eggs pop up, then I select eggs and whole wheat waffle pops up. You can set up meals for it to remember, but I prefer this auto-suggestion route as I’m often tweaking things I eat or have run out of one added ingredient, etc. It’s easy to do one food at a time because it remembers what the meal consisted of the  first time. Well done y’all and thank you!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have seen Noom commercials on tv and Facebook for months. I was really skeptical because the commercials were a bit vague, but a couple weeks ago I decided, why not? So I downloaded the app and got started. I have paid for personal nutrition coaching in the past that was ineffective, mainly because all the work to track foods, log exercises and answer several questions on a weekly check in were all on my shoulders and the process was just mentally exhausting. I didn’t accomplish any of my goals and just gave up after paying hundreds of dollars over a 6 month period. Now I’m kicking myself because I could have been following the Noom program and having fun! It comes with a very feasible monthly cost compared to my previous experience and a whole lot more support from both other noomers and program specialists! I’ve already lost 1 lb in just a few days of Noom! Looking forward to Nooming on and accomplishing my ultimate goals!

                      Title: Can’t customize workouts and food database
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app has good potential. But it has some flaws that can’t be overlooked. First, you can’t create a name to a custom workout. You can only call it “custom,” which is dumb. Second, their calorie counts in their food database are way off. I’ve compared them to other calorie counting apps and fast foods’ official menu, and Noom’s calories are either too low or too high. That’s not good, considering that counting calories is a big part of starting/continuing a healthy lifestyle. Also, when you create a custom food, it doesn’t let you scroll down to add fat, sodium, protein, etc. You have to keep going back to the main menu then go back to the “Your new food menu” to be able to scroll down to the next section to input data.

                      Title: Too much to read....
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Noom weight loss program seemed to focus on the psychological aspect of food. That got my interest because I gained 25 pounds over the last year, after being at home more than being at work, due to Covid. I’m 5’5” and I’ve always maintained a healthy weight of around 130. I didn’t overindulge in food, I exercised regularly and never dieted because I was always mindful of my weight. This last year, I ate more and was overall less active. Now I’m over 50 years old and the heaviest I’ve ever been. I’m a busy woman, I own a small business, time is a precious commodity. I figured Noom would cut to the chase. So I purchased 3 months. I figured, before each session there would be a short summary of food and psychology, then it would give me some direction. It was a freakin dissertation! A BOT would periodically send me a message of “encouragement”...to READ the next steps....NOT, let’s TAKE a few steps or let’s get active! Sitting on my bum READING why I’ve eaten more than I should have, isn’t going to get the weight off! This is precisely why I hate these weight loss gimmicks, the only things I’ve lost while participating with Noom, are time and, of course, money!!! Never again!!!

I really like Noom. I wanted to give it a try because I had to get rid of this quarantine weight. I think the tips are good, the time commitment is doable and following the program each day has made a shift in my mindset and habits. I have lost some weight. During the holiday season, I slipped into some old habits for temporary period of time but I’m back on track. The articles and tools are good with keeping things in perspective. The one piece of constructive feedback I have is that during the holiday season, there should be some tips tricks and tools to help specifically during that time because your routine gets interrupted with those factors, and one would need extra support then.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is horrible. There is a two week trial period, but I stopped after about 10 days because I was so frustrated with what they offered.  It’s basically a glorified calorie counting app.  (Continue below so you don’t get charged) I joined thinking this would be great for me as I travel a lot so it would be helpful for me to have people that I could check in with and get suggestions from and chat with.  After all, that’s what they advertise, right?  I was greeted immediately by someone (don’t remember her title), but I never heard from her again. (That was Step 1)  Might have been a robot for all I know, I’m sure it was auto generated.  Then on to my coach Desiree (Step 2 now) Except that no matter how I explain to her I’m looking for ideas, she tells me they won’t tell anyone what to do, and what are my ideas?   (She ends everything with “tell me your idea”).  I wasn’t asking for her to tell me what to do, but sometimes an idea, suggestion, something I haven’t thought of, might be nice.  You don’t get that here.  Oh, most importantly— just deleting the app DOES NOT STOP THEM FROM CHARGING YOU.  YOU MUST ASK THEM TO TAKE YOU OUT OF THE PROGRAM & GET A CONFIRMATION EMAIL

I tried the trial period, b/c I wanted to see what they were about and how they could help me. The trial was great and I see benefit from this app; I just wasn’t ready to commit with everything in my life going on. I forgot to cancel and was charged for 6 months; which I was upset, so I reached out thinking it was going to be a hassle to get a refund due to the no refund policy. I told them my story and luckily it was the same day my trial was to end. I was fully refunded and thanked by my Noom contact almost immediately. I can’t tell you how thankful I am that they made it easy and refunded my money no questions asked.   I was not expecting that. It’s refreshing to see a company doing good honest business. When I’m ready, I’ll probably come back. As for now I can only thank Noom and suggest people use Noom in the future as I believe they are a reputable company that stands behind what they do.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Joined the program to support weight loss. It is like having a personal trainer, one which gives you daily insight to your body, Nutrition 101 plus updated data information on a daily basis. It offers amazing tools (partnering with others via app, personal decision making about how fast you select to use weight by watching calories, tracking of food from restaurants/food calories for logging meals, recipes, etc.). You select a weight goal and are able to track daily-love the graph that shows future dates of possible (extrapolating) wt loss goal. In one month I’ve lost 15 lbs. That is good but one period I gained and then loss, but always sticking to the plan. I did not experience the emotional negative. Why? Because knowledge is powerful; the daily mini workshops are excellent - learning so much! A+ all the way around. Well worth the money! 🍎 An Apple for the NOOM website teacher.

Although the nutrition advice is fairly basic, the articles on psychology, how social environment impacts food etc has helped me rethink my relationship to eating in a positive way. I don’t feel obsessed with losing weight or a certain body type but developing an overall healthy lifestyle instead.

I feel more confident about maintaining a healthy balance in the long term. Also, the ads are true: you can still eat what you want, but you learn not to crave as much “junk,” learn better portion control, and feel better about making healthier choices when dining out.

I have been super happy with the program - 5 stars but just like that I was logged out and have been unable to get the app to work for days. Iron ai all it happened right after I was billed for another four month cycle. Customer support is basically sending the same script over and over again that does not fix the issue and the only solution they had was to start a new account t and lose all the data and tracking that I have built up for four months. Worst part is you can only contact through online chat so you are always starting over with you issue when it so not resolved and where they have minimal ability to do anything or they tell you to wait for an email from the tech team that then you never hear back from after you respond to their email. The program itself is great but the app and the support is awful. Basically I am now paying to see my billing account info but can’t use the app or anything else and they seem fine with that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been charged $180 for an app that is constantly glitching/crashing I downloaded this app on my old phone and wasn’t able to use it. After signing up for the free trial, which had its own issues, this app went haywire. I was constantly being logged off or the app would just close on me. Eventually it wouldn’t even open. I’d press the app and it would act like it was going to open but then it would close. I couldn’t even get it up to cancel my subscription. I just got a new phone and it did the same thing a few times but I was able to cancel my subscription. Unfortunately they’ve already charged me $180 because I wasn’t able to cancel before the trial period ended. Even though it wasn’t my fault their app wasn’t working on my phone, I’m not eligible for a refund. I don’t recommend this app to anyone. I do suggest that Noom reconsiders it’s refund policy, especially since it charges you for 8 months of time. So I have a useless subscription for a questionable app that I have no interest in trying to see how often it may work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

As a physician I was aware of some of this material but was unable to apply it to myself. The Noom program, by doling out info bit by bit, helps you absorb helpful strategies more successfully. Also personalized coaching and help from friends within the group helps you identify things in your environment that get in the way of your success. I successfully lost 12-15 # the first time around over about a 6 month tImeframe. I had struggled with the same 3-4# for 4-5 yrs prior to this! Over the past 4-5 mos my weight crept back up about 5-7 # so I am back for a second round and plan to focus more on the physical activity habit building this time since I think most of the food habits have stuck with me (reinforcement always helps though!). I recommend the program to patients who ask me for weight loss advice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I could have downloaded a calorie counter for free. Their daily advice is repetitive and time consuming. I suppose if you want to be nagged into exercising and eating right, it works. If you are just looking for a good way to track calories, this app is not worth the money. I am also extremely upset with their billing practices. The idea is that you sign up for whatever length of time they determine it will take you to reach your goal. Then if you fail to cancel before the free trial is up you pay a flat fee for the service for that pre-determined amount of time. What they fail to tell you is that the service auto renews after that period of time has passed. why would you need to auto renew this service if the whole idea is that you’ll reach your goal by the end of the period you paid for initially. And why keep this information a secret.  Every other app I have used with an auto renew sends a reminder before they charge you again, but not Noom. If they have such great results than why the deceptive billing practices?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I wish I had read some of the other reviews before I “registered”.  I did not pay attention to when my trial period ended and now I’m slapped with a $160 program fee until my next billing cycle. As the other reviewer noted, there is no way to access your account information through the app or through website. Their refund policy states once exceed trial period, you are charged fee and it’s up to me whether I want to continue to use their health coach or tools.  When I asked a question about the lump sum billing, I was sent a text message that was an “automated system generated message”. I tried the program for a little over a week but did not feel the content was significantly “better” or “different” from something you read on My Fitness Pal. Hence I was not going to continue but life happened and I did not cancel my trial period in time and I’m stuck with a $160 charge on credit card. Please think twice and ask for copy of billing policy because it’s difficult to access again after you’ve “enrolled”.

Food logging is frustrating. I’m not a fan of horizontal scrolling, but the bigger frustration is the lack of options...I have yet to see 1/3 cup or 1/8 cup options when needed. I would prefer to input a number rather than swipe. The ounce measurement option always seems to be the last option, and when I swipe, swipe, swipe to select it, the numbers change as if I’m converting the original units to ounces, so then I have to swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe the numbers back down! Ugh!  And  then, when I bout a new food item, complete with all the values for calories, etc., it seems I am unable to enter any option other than 1 serving the first time. Period.

The program is a very well structured and full featured food and exercise tracker. In many ways it worked just as good as, if not better than, its rivals such as my fitness pal or lose it. And it delivers results - I’ve lost almost 20 lbs in 3 months. But it’s also really annoying. The program is designed around psychology and cognitive behavioral modification - a worthy objective. But the lessons eventually deviate into a lot of very airy fairy esoteric almost new agey stuff - and you cannot just skip ahead. Moreover, it’s not easy to really “learn” the content. It moves too fast, there’s an excessive use of acronyms, there’s no actual directory or table of contents to help navigate the stuff, and it’s all done on your phone - no option to do this on a larger screen like your laptop. I’m letting my subscription end after the initial 4 month period and switching to My Fitness Pal.

I’ve always been one of those “all or nothing” guys when it comes to eating, working out, and life in general. As a result, my weight, fitness levels, and health would fluctuate wildly in short periods of time. And nothing would stick and I’d end up back at my original unhealthy state. Fast forward to now - I’m 2 months into my noom journey - and I’ve made real, long-term changes to my eating habits and psychological thinking around health and food. I’m 75% of the way towards my weight loss goal — and I feel like it hasn’t been terribly hard for me. I haven’t been doing any crazy workouts, or dieting, or prohibiting myself from foods. Noom just helps your brain change over time, one lesson at a time. And it’s been incredibly rewarding to see the changes. I’m loving it and I cannot recommend noom enough.

                      Title: Deceptive bill and Weight watchers clone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Essentially Noom is a weight watcher clone in where they revamp the “point” system into one that is color coded based on levels of fullness. There is included a “health” coach that I was sure was a bot offering mediocre and cliche statements like, “how will it feel to you to reach your idea weight?”. Mostly open ended questions to seem like they are engaged in tour progress. Obviously, the program is still based on a daily caloric limit with a food scanner and search option. Again basically a revision of weight watchers with some reworking so they don’t infringe on copy rights. My contention with NOOM is the initial trial will cost you $10 a week then after the trial period you are automatically charge the annual rate of $168. Deceptive practice in my opinion.  How many times have you started a trial only to forget and be charged. NOOM takes that to the next level. I filed complaint with the Pennsylvania Attorney General, Josh Shapiro. I would encouraged any other users affected by the unscrupulous billing practices of NOOM to do like wise.

I used to live and teach in Detroit and Kaua’i where the environments are very different.  Noom reminds me about choices about the types of intake and their effect on my weight.  I used to walk and swim several types a week.  After a divorce of over 38 years and an change back to a cold climate triggered a different mindset.  Noom helped me become aware of how the weight accumulated.  I bought an exercise bike last year that became a coat rack.  Noom has tracking methods for walking, exercising and more!  It motivated me to dust it off and use it.  Last night I discovered the recipes!  Thank you Noom.  When I think of the money I spent on gaining weight, the price of Noom is a drop in the bucket for improving my health and state of mind, especially during Covid.  Buy it now, but thank Noom when you see results.

I really wanted to like this app, the first week started off great, I didn’t mind the reading at first, but got tired of the constant attempts at humor and play on words day in and day out. The “fitness coach” assigned to me felt like was reading/writing from a script, so didn’t feel like I was working with an actual coach.   I’ve had much success with WW in the past, but got tired of them changing their point system so I figured I’d give NOOM  a try to get back on track, sadly it didn’t meet my expectations. I didn’t like the daily weigh ins, I understand why they do this, but as many of you know weight fluctuates and seeing the ups and downs became discouraging.  I wish I did more research before purchasing this program. 7 days is not a long enough trial period, a month would have been better, as I would have known by the end of the month that this program a waste of money and not for me.

I had looked into Noom because I was looking for something different to help me with weight loss and keeping fit since other methods I have tried were not working. I started the trial period paying $10 for 2 weeks of “free” trial because I felt that my trainer or whoever it was answering my texts, A REAL PERSON I HOPE, NOT A MACHINE, deserved something for their work and patience with me. But less than 2 weeks in, I felt that the app wasn’t really working for me and I constantly forget that I was even using it. I looked to see if I could cancel and on an iPhone you can look at all your subscriptions in the APP store and see if it auto renews or not or how much longer a trial period will last, BUT when I checked, it DID NOT TELL ME I was on auto renewal; NOR DID IT TELL ME THAT THE NEXT SUBSCRIPTION WAS A ONE TIME PAYMENT OF $130! We are living through PANDEMIC!!!!! SOME PEOPLE DONT HAVE $130 TO WASTE ON AN APP! SOME PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED AND OTHERS THAT ARE WORKING HAVE SHORTER HOURS. THAT MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO BUY GROCERIES/ MASKS/ GLOVES/ HAND SANITIZERS/ BASIC NECESSITIES FOR MY FAMILY AND I!

Super Skeptical at First. I’ve tried other meal plan diets and they all seem to work to an extent for the initial period but never seem to keep it off. I REALLY like how they hammer home daily lessons on this app to keep me motivated and on the same path. Also helped me understanding that there will be peaks and valleys and when you find that you slipped up it’s how you recover that’ll get you back on path. This too is giving me positive results daily which makes me feel happy with my current lifestyle changes and seems easier to stick on the program long term. All that will be determined in years down the road but after 6 weeks in I’m impressed with the program and hope to be teaching myself a life change for the long haul.

Have been using for about 3-weeks. Navigation isn’t consistent. Using the chat icon at the top left opens a choice between coach and group chat, but once in the chats, the icon disappears. You use the hamburger menu on the top right to see the two chat types as separate entries. The food database could be cleaned up and updated with major restaurant chain foods. The Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich is in there a couple times as both yellow and red food. When adding custom meals from Home Chef (which isn’t represented very well at all in the database), switching back and forth between the apps makes it so I can’t scroll down past entering carbs. The keyboard blocks the rest of the fields and I can’t scroll past it to see sodium, sugar, or protein. Might be nice to link with something like MyFitnessPal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am loving this program. Lots of “food for thought” with questions and ideas that cause you to rethink your whole relationship with food. I gave it a four because I wish it would allow you to input a beef fajita, for example and elaborate on it by indicating the ingredients and calorie content rather than having to input each separate ingredient listing carbs, sodium, protein, etc. in addition I would like to be able to sync my step watch with Noom, but unable to do so because Noom doesn’t sync with the brand of step watch I have. I love having to log meals, weigh in each day, and chatting with other Noom participants. I haven’t really figured out the one-on-one coaching. Not sure if it’s me or the coach, but don’t feel like we’ve really connected. But, again, I’m loving it and recommend it!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The app itself is janky and makes it difficult to keep a good log. The coaches don’t suggest anything, they instead email you asking what your goals are and use a lot of explanation points I imagine in an attempt to appear more helpful than they are. I actually asked my coach for suggestions and she said they don’t do that they just cheerlead you on your own self identified goals. Additionally Noom is shady with payment and if you don’t pay attention when your trial period is up they charge you more than $200 for an 18 month subscription and tell you that you chose it though they are not able to support that with any proof! I’d try pretty much any other option. Since I’ve already paid against my will I’m stick with this crap for 18 months. Oh and they don’t tell you how to unsubscribe from auto renew so I will. Email their customer support numerous times and they will finally and begrudgingly remove you from auto renew.

Debated for several months about doing this (you know... “I know what to do, why pay for an app?”) but decided to try it with the trial period. I ended up sticking with it, mostly because I started paying attention again, which I could do on my own but don’t. Go figure. Anyway... the information is positive, encouraging, and the writers are seriously funny. I keep up (because of the cost motivator) and have been reminded I kid myself all the time about how much I’m eating. (Oh crap.. that giant bowl of “healthy” oatmeal is 3servings!) I can justify just about anything in my own mind, but being accountable on Noom (in an easy way) makes one much more self aware. Have lost a couple pounds and am feeling motivated. Good stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Noom is such a great idea. Their CBT training, etc. seems really effective and has me motivated. But I noticed some problems from day one. First, it literally suggested I would reach my goal weight loss (something like 45 pounds) in a month. I don’t know how it calculated that, but obviously it was odd. Second, the food tracking is a joke. Its database was far off on virtually every food, to the point it was impossible to use. Part of what it was training me to do was to be mindful of what I eat—which is virtually impossible when every item’s calorie count is off by an order of magnitude. I would love to give Noom a chance beyond the trial period. But I’m not willing to venture my time or treasure on a product that is just plain worse than a free alternative. Maybe consider MyFitnessPal integration, or integration with another successful food database software. But for an app and service that has supposedly reached the big leagues, I couldn’t be more disappointed.

There is nothing about this service that is unique.  There are 100 other free apps/services that do the same thing.  They understand this and tout a monthly charge, but then when you sign up for a trial say "you have to switch to the monthly charge option during the free trial".  That is not clear.  Then when requested to refund the difference, as I was willing to try it for the full month they refused even to go that step.  There is a whole option when you try and cancel that is "I didn't realize i would be paying in one lump sum" which proves this is a common issue their users have.  They offered "65% off AFTER the period when I had already paid - which makes the cost $19/month.  That tells me, that that is actually what there service should be valued at.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been using Noom for almost 2 months now. I started with the free trial and absolutely loved it. About a month in, it seems as if things started to change. When first starting Noom, I had access to 8-10 articles per day and my coach would reach out to me periodically to see how things were going. I felt as if I was really learning new information and the psychology piece was working. Now that I am on a monthly subscription, it seems the daily articles have been reduced to only 3-4 per day and I haven’t heard from my coach in weeks. The articles also seem to regurgitate a lot of information that had already been stated. I feel as of their business model is to drag out the “learning” portion to get more monthly payments. I could be wrong, but I have canceled my monthly subscription as the app does nothing for me now.

                      Title: An early review
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been using Noom for a week - halfway thru the 2 week trial - and I have to say I’m not impressed. My “Goal specialist” has yet to actually help me set a single goal. She takes 2 -3 days to respond to my answers to her queries. Today’s brilliant question was “what do you think would motivate you to go to the gym once this week after work”. Well, shoot! If I knew that I probably wouldn’t have an issue getting to the gym after work, right? The articles are cutely presented. I wish the food logs from Fitbit would transfer to the app so I don’t have to log the same stuff twice. Unfortunately, Noom doesn’t give you a coach until after the free 2 week period. Based on what I’ve seen so far, I’m not sure I’ll continue with it. What I’ve gotten this week isn’t worth the price tag they’re charging. There has to be something more or better executed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Noom has a lot of potential but I’m baffled at how they expect people to pay $150 for this service. With coaching, it’s a fair price and if you know nothing about weight loss or nutrition I could see spending up to $50 for all the information provided. However my coach sent a two bot-like messages and then told me she’d check back in on Tuesday. It’s now Thursday and nothing. Emailed support about it twice with no response (they said support would respond within 6 hours). Not sure why I would pay $150 for basic calorie tracking and a false promise of a coach who doesn’t follow through with their coaching. Do what you say you’re going to do and don’t blow customers off, there’s enough of that in the real world and I don’t need it in a paid app. I’d suggest Cronometer for tracking instead (they track your micronutrients) and join a fb group or spend that $150 on a coach who does their job.

A friend who is doing the program said it took her awhile before she “got it” and started losing weight so I stuck with it. Although it’s still up and down on the scales it’s mostly down. It gives me incentive to keep going and challenging myself to go lower. I look at food, serving sizes, environment and all I’ve learned so far with a new understanding and attitude. I feel so much better physically and mentally. Thank you Noom for saving me and teaching me that I can make these life changes! The every day teaching and encouragement makes a huge difference!

I have learned so many new ways to take care of my body INDEPENDENTLY and how to reflect and make mindful decisions, so it will really carry over long term. No more programs that tell you what exercises to do and exactly what foods to eat. Figuring out what works for you and what healthy habits can realistically be implemented into day to day living is what is truly sustainable. I also love that it’s so holistic- it’s not completely about going to the gym or eating salads. It’s also about stress and sleep and your environment, and addressing that is so unique! I can’t believe I’m only half way done with the program!

It takes that kind of commitment because to throw oneself fully into the program requires time and planning and a willingness to let an app tell you what to do (something I struggled with at first).  However, having jumped in with both feet and allowing myself to be guided, ironically I now feel very much more in control!  One month later and seven pounds down, I have an entirely different way of giving energy to my body in a healthy way and I don’t feel deprived at all!

Those were all incredibly helpful CBT type things to facilitate 1-2 lb/ wk weight loss and improvement in fitness/activity levels over 6mo period. Helped me reach goals w/o feeling like I had to make huge changes, which are often hard to permanently incorporate as good lifelong habits.

A question to start: when you add a food is the option to add the barcode also an option? If not, it should be. Also, you should have the option to add things like fiber and protein (which I don’t believe you can add). In addition, since this is a paid service, it would be great if it also gave other information such as Vitamin C so that you could also track how much you consume (or how much you lack) on a daily basis. Losing weight is great, but I assume that being completely healthy is also a goal. The color system is fantastic but knowing I get enough protein and fiber would be great too. There must be a way to track that as well instead of just tracking calories.

It isn't cute and fun, it is unbearable and intolerable. If Noom believes it’s insights and approach is worth the value that customers are being asked to pay, then they should provide that information and stop wasting my time with such nonsense. I had high hopes. I wanted to “BELIEVE” like the app asks you to do, but the language used in the lessons made that more and more impossible. I found myself eventually just tapping through the lessons rather than giving them the thoughtful attention they might have deserved because I felt like I was reading something written by Microsoft’s failed A.I. bot “Tay.”

Aside from their deceptive billing practices and exploitative trial period, the program is incredibly dull and condescending. Anyone who understands nutrition and basic psychology would already know most of their program pillars that they’ve slapped some buzzy names on. At best this program is an overpriced Facebook weight loss group and Fitbit app. In fact, the Fitbit app is more helpful. Nutritional information is horrible aside from “eat fruits and veggies.” Most of us “millennials” struggle  with a takeout and on the go lifestyle so recipes were daunting to find and ridiculous to execute. No support was given on the front of balancing work meals and on the go travel nutrition. They also don’t tell you your trial is ending until after they’ve charged you hundreds of dollars without giving you plan and program options, then refuse to issue refunds. Avoid. Anything else is better.

No food is off limits. However, your favorite foods just need to be limited is all in order to make room for healthier foods that will keep you fuller for a longer period of time. The accountability tracker to log all my meals has been incredibly useful. I recommend this weight loss app to everyone who has tried everything there is out there. You won’t be disappointed.

However, I found that the processes of food logging method and checking in with some person were not resonating with me. It was indicated that my trial end date was 7/10. It was clear to me that this date was the last day of my trial and if I didn’t want to continue using Noom I should cancel by this day. However, I was charged $99 for a two month subscription which I did not want on 7/10.  As of yet, I have had no luck communicating with anyone regarding the issue of being refunded. I would completely understand if I forgot until the following day, but my account clearly indicates 7/10 as the end date for the trial period. Absolutely ridiculous to be charged on the LAST DAY of the trial.

I asked my coach about this and it was never resolved. After your two week trial period, you are supposed to be assigned a support group, I was assigned a support group only after I asked more than once after 6 weeks. Noom claims they march you with people on similar journeys for your support group...NOT TRUE! They are very high on promises and very short on delivery.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree with other reviews about poor customer service. Any help you need you have sort through the options. Then if can’t find the answer, you send an email. Eventually they contact you but the messaging back and forth can take days to resolve. Any coaching support is slow going and only by text messages. Then it takes 2-3 days to get a response. It is on their timeline not yours. You have to wait for the trial period to end and commit to paying a non refundable $99 before you get any community support. Soooo many other apps that track food out there without the high purchase price!! Plus it has trouble syncing fitbits. I plan to use another app and forget Noom.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first time I’ve ever left a review for an app because I feel so strongly that Noom is charging people for a service that falls FAR below their promises. Primarily I’m referring to the “goal specialist” which reminds me of the AIM bots that you would send a message to and they would reply back with nonsense. They promise 24/7 availability of a real person - this is simply a lie. It is clearly an automated system and does not respond to questions or to the answers you give to their questions. My messages went unanswered for long periods of time and they did not ever respond to what I was asking or saying. When they did respond it was a script from an FAQ and they never followed through. I reached out to customer support and got ANOTHER prescripted response. THIS IS A SCAM. Use the free version.

I was very skeptical when I first signed up for Noom. However, the reviews were good and I was needing something to help me get into a low fat high fiber diet due to my diverticulitis. I am already down 6 pounds in five weeks and I don't feel like I’m starving myself to death.  The app itself is easy to navigate and very user friendly. The information you receive each day is broken down into small, maybe 10 minute sessions.  Yes, you pay for the service if you go beyond the two week trial period but, since it works, I don’t mind. I would highly recommend!

A friend recommended Noom when I asked how he had lost weight.  I tried it and had excellent results.  After achieving my first goal, over a period of about 45 days, I experienced difficulty retaining the loss.  I rejoined with the intent to lose several more pounds in addition to my initial 15 pounds.  I have achieved that goal and now I have added another 5 pounds.  I am working on my final goal and then I will work hard to maintain that level.  I now have no problem walking 18 holes of golf while pushing a cart with my clubs.  I am pleased with the program and recommend it to everyone.

Also I was disappointed how little my goal specialist reached out to me. The tips were great. I really didn’t like that I couldn’t look back at what exercise I logged. Also after only eating about 1000 calories a day for a whole week I had a glass of wine and a shot and the app asked me how I felt logging that? Which I feel is so passive aggressive and completely unnecessary, it made me feel awful. Make it cheaper and more user friendly.

I really enjoy how the program teaches you the necessary things to lose weight -both physically and mentally. This program has approached the root cause of my excess weight (psychology based) and helped me be more aware of my nutrition and exercise habits. It does a good job of keeping you accountable for those habits and teaching you how to overcome your negative behaviors as well. I started just before Thanksgiving and have been on the program since then, losing about 10pounds thus far, even with my birthday and Christmas in that time period. I will continue on as I attempt to lose 55pounds by June 20’. #noomnerd

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was really enjoying this app (4 stars worth) until recently when they apparently updated their food logging database. Now when I scan item barcodes that I have been logging for over a month, they come up as different products altogether, or have the wrong calorie information, food “color” (green/yellow/red), or nonsensical serving size options. Many items that you could type in to search up before, now say “custom dish” and don’t have any calorie information. This is a major bummer because food tracking and calorie counting was the main feature that made the investment worthwhile. Especially if you are already fairly healthy, and/or familiar with cognitive behavioral psychology/therapy. Unless they fix the food log, I will not renew when this contract period expires.

Plus I love the little sense of humor that is added daily which makes it fun!!   The daily meals, the shopping lists, the recipes—everything is right there for you to make the choices!  Love, love, love it!!!! 😊

I went through all the questionnaire questions and was even willing to do the free trial period for 14 days as it claimed before I chose to purchase it because it’s not cheap. After putting in my card information, an advance button appeared offering me a deal on the program if I skipped the trial. And the no I don’t want to do that button was discrete beneath. I accidentally clicked the skip and purchase button and it automatically charge my card $100 I’m very upset right now and think this is ridiculous I think if they claim to want to help people you shouldn’t try to pull things like this.

I love Noom - I’ve lost ten pounds so far. The system is very clear and works well, and I like that I can stick to what works for me and disregard the rest. However, after an update the app started to completely malfunction. A few times, the “log meals” and “weigh in” buttons completely vanished. What’s even more annoying is when the app won’t even open, loading forever, forcing me to redownload it from the App Store. I’ve had to do this four times, and it really slows my progress to not have the app available for large periods of time. It’s a shame because otherwise, five stars!

On top of that the service doesn’t even start until 2 weeks after you sign up? Look I’m motivated now... and need that continued pressure to stay motivated. If your not going to give me the plan right off the bat then I cannot be with you. NOT ONLY THAT ALL CONTACT WITH COACHES ARE AUTOMATED MESSAGES? I need real help, not a computer.

I’ve done weight watchers before and this kind of is similar but way easier. I like that it’s all about making internal changes to how you deal with creating and maintaining healthy habits to keep for the long run. You can still eat the things you love and it’s not an extreme diet where you omit entire food groups, that kind of weight loss never lasts.

During the initial questionnaire it said the trial subscription was free but later you are asked how much you would pay to try a service like this and there was not a free option. The lowest option was $1. Basically whichever option you choose is what they charge you for the “free” trial period. Later when your free trial is over they just charge you for the highest plan without ever asking you if you want the monthly, 4 month, 6 month or annual plan. You are never asked at any point to pick a plan nor are you told it’s automatically the highest plan. Even if you cancel when you realize what they have done, the charges are not refundable. They are shady! Their program may be ok but it is not worth being subjected to shady charges and business practices.

I share the sentiments of others. Nice beginning. Horrible middle. They send you reminders to log your lunch, but no reminder that your trial period is about to be over OR, that you will be billed for 4 months upfront instead of monthly once the trial is over. I’m sure this information is buried some place in fine print, but they should do a better job of making sure patrons know (so that they don’t leave the program upset by this portion of the transaction). Lastly, when I did cancel the subscription (the same day I was billed $129 for 4 months), it took layers of searching to figure out how to do so. To me, it should be A MORE TRANSPARENT PROCESS. For that reason, I’d advise against using the app.

Only one week in but I’ve lost two pounds and I can feel a difference in my body. I needed accountability. Noom gives this to me. I will always dislike counting, measuring, blah, blah, blah but this makes the logging of all of that very easy. The only “complaint” I have (if this can even really be counted) is that I signed up for the 2 week trial  period on a Tuesday night, and Noom counted that as my first day, so beware. Sign up the morning you’re ready to get started or you’ll lose a day. I also LOVE the “sense of humor” in the readings and such provided. It makes me happy.

After years of yo-yo dieting, periods of success but many more of self-doubt and self-consciousness, Noom has changed my life. A borderline diabetic diagnosis of my A1C was what finally drove me out of desperation to try something different like Noom. In 8 months on Noom I lost 40 lbs and it never felt like a diet. My A1C is in the normal range now. I know I can maintain this lifestyle and never tire of hearing the compliments from people I haven’t seen in a while. I highly highly recommend Noom if you truly want to learn why you continually fail in losing weight. You won’t regret it!

They don’t refund your money even after you canceled your subscription and did know when your last trial date was. I had to go online to figure how to cancel it. Try another app that reminds of how many days you have left in the trial period. The worst app ever!!!!!!

I agree with those who say that they just prey on busy people who will agree to sign up for $1 and then forget to cancel when the trial period is over...  I think this only benefits folks who will stick to a program on principal if they are coughing up large amounts of cash for it every month... Please people, buy yourself something nice instead, like some cute gym clothes or some pricey smoothie add-ins!  Seriously, most GYM MEMBERSHIPS are CHEAPER than this.  Ridiculous!!!

So, this app/program was not for me because I was under the impression it was more focused on holistic wellness and it truly is a weight loss program.

However, maybe this could be good if someone is really struggling to address a weight related health condition. Although it didn’t work for me I wanted to write this review to say that it was so easy to cancel. I was amazed. It is not scammy at all and they make it very easy to get out during your trial period which I loved!

They realize no one is going to pay $50 a month for their useless app.  That is why they charge two months and make it hard to cancel.

I want to caution others from joining under the trial period. As with any trial program, the initial cost is much less and is intended to give the consumer a taste of what the service aims to provide. However, usually there are clear terms of the plans or options moving beyond the trial period. Noom failed to inform me of such information. Furthermore, I find it comical that when I followed the prompts to cancel/refund my costly membership charge, the one method of doing this is complex and unclear. I expected more out of such a highly rated application. To this day, o have no clue what Noom’s response was to my request, because they instantly changed my account from member to new. The data was all missing and no log appears of my conversations with their Goal Specialist.

Her job is to help me set small goals and overcome obstacles. And she doesn’t do anything. At $50/month (after the trial period of two weeks), I really expected that the goal specialist actually be helpful and interactive. Also, at this point the app is supposed to have connected me to a group of other boomers and a coach... and none of this has happened. I feel like I’m not getting a lot of what I’m paying for.

I used Noom religiously for 2 years and then took a 6 month break.  I recently subscribed again and I am shocked by the rocky performance of the app and the elimination of the coach who you can talk to by phone. When I log my food, the app screen goes blank for 15 seconds before it goes to the next screen, which feels like an eternity.   As for eliminating the ability to talk to your coach live, that was incredibly motivating aspect of the Noom offering. Now you are limited to texting with your coach and it doesn’t allow for the rich conversations that happened through live conversations.  $40 per month subscription for a glitchy app and only being able to periodically text with a coach seems overpriced.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I would normally have given Zoom a 4-5 star rating because I enjoyed using the app. But they give no notice when your subscription is ending and it automatically renews. There is also no way to contact customer support. I found the pending charge on my credit card bill and now have to pay for an entire 4 months extra. When I look for a customer service email there is none, when I click on contact support it’s just an info page.  So enjoy the app but make sure to put your end date in your calendar so you don’t get stuck paying for something you don’t want at the end of your subscription period.

I tried them all! Numerous diets that successfully helped me lose weight. None of them taught me how to keep the weight off while returning to a normal environment. I would have to stay on the diet to keep the weight off and no one wants to spend their life on a diet. Noom teaches you about all the pitfalls around eating and how to navigate around them. I don’t think of Noom as a diet that gives me a limited menu. I think of Noom as giving me control over eating that helps me lose weight and keep it off!

I really enjoyed Noom for about the first 3 weeks, the quizzes and tools were very helpful. About a week after the trial period I decided to cancel because I knew I wouldn’t continue using the service long term. I was OK knowing I paid and didnt expect a refund. Their policy is that you keep full premium service until the billing cycle was over. After cancelling I received a message from my coach saying I’d be reverted back to the free service. I brought up their policy and she replied back saying I was correct. Well, doesn’t matter because now I’m back to the free service and should have full access for another two months. Don’t bother with these people. Pretty sure my goal specialist was a bot or someone NOT who they say they were.

Guess I am okay with having a computer friend. Only thing that hasn’t really jelled yet is the personal coaching but I think that may be because I am still in the trial period. I am hopeful that once I am in the full program that part will be satisfactory too.

What has worked for me is the combination of tracking (food, weight, and exercise), the focus on “green” vs “red foods” in the right way and moderation, and the short daily readings (helped me think about moderation, why/when I eat, environmental cues, etc. - simply made me more aware to make good decisions). It’s worked great for me!

Every day we go through a simple, funny lesson to identify the psychological, sociological, and environmental factors that impact how, why and when we eat. I have been a very successful dieter in the past but always put the weight back on. Noom is training me to change what I eat long term and teaching me simple tricks to recognize triggers that cause my overeating. No food is forbidden but merely regulated in their simple division of food into three categories.

My step goal for the day also hasn't been showing up. I also don’t have a calorie goal for the day. These issues have been happening throughout my whole trial, so you can see that is not leaving me much confidence in this app. I am willing to try this app after the trial, but I will feel like I’m wasting money if these issues aren’t solved. Please try to fix these issues ASAP.... I want to be a noomer, but I also don’t wanna waste my money or my time.

I stopped using the app and moved on. Several weeks later I was billed for my next 2 month subscription.  When I called it to the attention of the support team that I was no longer using the app they were very gracious and returned my $$$.  The Noom coaches and support team were delightful to work with and u would recommend them to anyone wanting to use this app to lose weight.

As others have mentioned, the food logging is cumbersome.

Not sure that she’s a robo but also not sure that she is real. Honestly, I think these are poorly paid people  who are  telecommuting 🤷🏽‍♀️ Yes, interesting diet & eating tips but is it overall amazing... no. However I’m willing to keep going for week 2 — no refunds once you go into the paid subscription part. Buyer Beware.

Noom is not a weight loss program.  Noom is a reformation of habits, thoughts and reactions to the food in your environment.  Noom is exactly what I needed.  It is the positive reinforcement of all the things I’ve already been doing that is good (exercise, water intake, healthy eating) but what’s more, Noom is accountability for everything else that needs to be reformed (snacking at night, my sweet tooth, ability to make small food swaps that make a huge difference).  Noom was my Christmas present to myself and the best Christmas present ever!!

I downloaded the app thinking I would receive personalized support - but it was all completed via text messaging from someone in Michigan- I live in Seattle. They are just pre-established push messages .... and not engaging communication. After a period of time, I never heard from my Coach again. I read the reviews and knew the app’s shortcomings going into it but decided to try it anyway. I took the time to respond to my Coach with concrete data elements about my weight loss journey and, in turn, I received a canned message that said “Great job”.... and I laughed. So non-human.

Do not fall for the 7 day free trial. They app says that the trial is free so long as you go into the settings in the app and cancel before the 7 days. Then when you try to do that, after much looking in the app, you are then told that you have to message your coach to cancel. Once you do that, it takes over a day for your couch to message back only to then tell you that you have to cancel the subscription through iTunes. Now it’s past the 7 day trial period so they charge you $50 for your monthly subscription! Do not fall for the 7 day free trial! You will not be able to cancel timely and thus you will be charged $50 days for a trial of less than 7 days. And the “coach” does no coaching at all.

Beware that when you initiate the 2 week free-trial subscription to begin using this app - it automatically starts charging you after the trial period ends. Deleting the app does not cancel this trial or the fees. The only way to cancel fees after you’ve started using the app is to tell your coach/specialist that you want to cancel and then you get a link to cancel. I signed up for the app, found it not for me, and deleted it in a few days. I later learned that Noom had charged me. Luckily, their fine customer service helped correct this and issued a refund.

Also, was promised participation in a group which was never provided. Never got to set a SMART goal and never had any support. Once I decided to cancel my membership, I was offered a different payment plan at a cheaper price. I didn’t take the offer.

I also read an article stating that the app will charge you after your trial ends even if you canceled the renewal, I am hoping this will not happen but I will have to wait until the trial period has ended.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

As a person who has lost 100’s is pounds (and gained even more!), I have tried many weight loss programs. Noom is good.  It’s easy to use.  It all encompassing. It’s balanced. It’s got a good, basic but realistic approach.  You still have todo it!  I lost a significant amount, went through a long stalled period, gained a bit...but not are going full speed. Other programs when I have gone back have seemed mundane.  This feels good. Good luck.

If you sign up for the free trial and start to cancel they may offer another free week, so it is easy to forget to permanently cancel and you’ll end up with a $159 charge on your card and iron clad policy that they won’t give you a refund even if requested on the same day their charge went through. The program does not appear to have anything unique and unavailable for feee or much less in the App Store eg calorie and step counting and reminder notifications. The educational tips are widely known and available free on the internet. I feel I’ve been ripped off big time and wasted money after giving it a fair trial.

So I downloaded the app, answered all the questions, was prompted to enter my credit card information for my $18 fee for the “free 2 week trial”. It then led me to create my profile. Once I entered my profile info, the “next” button was frayed out so that I couldn’t advance. I double and triple checked everything. I was stuck there. So I got out of app and went back in. It started over and wanted me to pay again for my trial period. The only way to request to cancel is to go to your profile, which I couldn’t finish creating! Now I have to file a report with my credit card agency, which is aggravating!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Very disappointed in this app and their business ethics. When my trial period of 2 weeks ended, I was charged $130 for 3 months. The major issue is they do not make your account access readily available through the app (you have to communicate with your (bot?) coach about requests to terminate subscriptions. When I contested the charge, I accepted I should be responsible for a month since I cancelled late, but they refused to refund the 2 extra months. I became privy to the charge when my bank contacted me about the suspicious charge on my card. Beware of these guys. I’ve alerted the BBB about their dishonest and purposefully confusing business practices.

Noom is not for me. I realized this immediately. I am not interested in group-first orientation of their program; my health & progress are my own business, and it should be optional to share, not mandatory. Their two-week trial period is misleading; based on the phases outlined after registering, there is no value add in first two weeks. Lastly, Noom’s tone is too in-your-face cheesy for my tastes; it has an exasperating attitude and comes off as little more than yet another example of Silicon Valley’s disconnected-from-reality lifestyle guru nonsense. I’m just glad I figured this out before they charged my credit card for their nonsense.

Although I found the app helpful with the small amount of time required daily, i spent two hours during the trial period trying to find out when and how much I would be charged, to no avail. Then without notification from the company, I was charged $99 dollars for two months, which includes only app access. When I cancelled they would not refund me any of the money, even though I requested it the day it was billed. In addition, they them reached out to me and “conveniently” the monthly fee was then dropped from 99$ every two months to 19$ a month. Very misleading and no good business for a weight loss program.

There was no warning the trial period was over, they didn’t let me pick my subscription plan, the just immediately charged me for a two month subscription. I understand most apps will immediately charge you once the trial period is over. What I find strange is that they just took my money without even letting me choose what kind of subscription plan I wanted, which definitely would not have been the $99 one.

I had a moderate goal of losing 8 lbs.  This should not usually be a problem for me but in the pandemic + winter I was struggling on my own and I thought Noom might help. Plan was about a pound a week which seems perfectly attainable but I’ve lost nothing - maybe 1-2 lbs almost 8 weeks later and as we know that could be water. The “coaching” is a weekly text from someone who I suspect may be a bot. The price seemed reasonable for the time period and goal - less than a pair of shoes. Now they want to charge me again to continue on a program that is not working as they represented at the start. How many pairs of shoes for 8 lbs? Nope.

Be careful of auto-renewal. They provide no notice of upcoming renewal. You can easily access your subscription details but it usually after you have been charged again. AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO CONTACT NOOM DIRECTLY BY PHONE! Had I not had difficulty in unsubscribing, I would have a higher rating.  The daily log in of meals is very easy.  Activity and daily weight is also easy to log.  The “psychology” of weight loss is very interesting at first but gets tedious and with me was skipped after a month.  It helped me to reach a weight goal at first but for over $50 a month after the trial period is a bit pricey.

There is no assessment of he person to find out their baseline for health, fitness & diet, they just send out their cookie-cutter “to do lists”...which, who has time for that? Expected so much more given the marketing push on social media and the strong reviews.

Their customer service is automated- no live person to reach. Just straight to voice mail or email only. Because I cancelled, I no longer have access to the messages to and from my “coach” who never responded to my request concerning when to expect my refund. Really horrible support & kind of sketchy.

NOOM will charge you up front for its estimate of how long it will take to reach your weight loss goals. The money is non-refundable after your trial period, so if you have a change of heart, too bad for you. Additionally, your account will auto-renew and you’ll be charged to the tune of about $270 per year indefinitely, unless you jump through several hoops to cancel your subscription. This app seems to have helped some, but I’ve had better success on my own. The NOOM set-up seems to me like nothing more than a pyramid scheme. If you have money to waste, go for it.

                      Title: Not for me and with no trial period money down the drain.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I read all the reviews and figured I would give it a try. Unfortunately it wasn't for me and realized three days in. As I felt like I was in therapy or grade school.  I was very disappointed as I was lead on to a 7 day trial period that I though was free yet when signing up the took out a fee 18 dollar and some change. Apparently either I don’t know how to sign up to get the free trial or they just lead people on with out it. Rather way they wouldn’t refund me the amount. Hopefully this saves someone else who may be skeptical.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Noom makes it seem like they are going to charge you for a monthly plan after the 14-day trial period but then they actually charge you for 6 months! My bill was $160! I was shocked. Then they say they can’t refund you once it’s been charged. As further evidence that they know they are suckering you, when you cancel your subscription they ask you for a reason. One of the possible choices is “Thought I would be billed monthly, not for 6 months at a time.” Taking advantage of people trying to lose weight or manage their diabetes is shameful.

Noom was a great way to start my weight loss journey.  I signed up for six months and  lost 12 pounds. However, at the end of the six month period, I decided to go another route.  Unbeknownst to me, I was charged for another six months without being warned.  I contacted Noom the same day and they were only able to give me a partial refund.  Be careful what you sign up for!

From what I’ve seen so far, this is an application in for only its own gain and not for others. I was using this app, and after a few days knew that I would never have the time each day to put into taking quizzes, so I messaged to cancel my trial as they mentioned in the help section. I then proceed to get charged a few days later for something I had cancelled way before the trial end period. No one has helped me, talking to a real human being is IMPOSSIBLE. And this is a time sensitive issue. I would NEVER recommend this application to anyone.

The food tracking is based off of green yellow and red foods and does little to help you track specifics such as sodium intake. It shouldn’t too much of an ask to be able to track these other areas. It’s also a little unrealistic to limit red foods, and can be discouraging when you know that tracking anything outside of fruits and veg, shows up in yellow and red categories which gives a negative connotation, not sure how realistic that is.

I think the app is very good but have a recommendation. I like to double check my meal entries at the end of the day, to be sure I captured everything.

It would be nice to just scroll between instead of closing it out and reopening in another meal period.

They ask how much you’d like to donate for your trial, but DO NOT make it clear that there will be another charge coming without notice or consent. The process to request a refund gets completely lost (I’m on my 3rd attempt in 3 days to get an answer that they say “they’ll respond to in 2 hours”), there is no communication from the company and no number to reach them at. Very disappointed!

They will not refund you and it is EXPENSIVE. Keep a food journal. It will give you a better experience because this app will stress you out and stress will make you gain weight. They use the BOT to write themselves reviews too. If you write a bad not they follow up with a good one for themselves. Disgusting. They are taking advantage of you. Don’t fall for it.

You need to spend hours on ur phone every day - logging, reading, communicating - manageable in the short term but not sustainable over a longer period.  In my opinion, their actual goal is to get people to pay for 12 months (no refunds) and overload them so they stop using it after a month or two.

They just stopped emailing me back and today I was charged for another month. I am absolutely livid that the customer service is so bad.

I love Noom so far as a system. As an app, I think it has some things to iron out. Some foods are not the correct calorie count. Adding a recipe is tricky and I have lost all of the things I submitted multiple times because I accidentally hit the wrong button. In those ways it could be more user friendly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Noom app does not send you any advance notice before automatically renewing your subscription.  Also, you cannot manually change the settings to stop auto renewals—you have to send a message to your “goal specialist” and formally request to be unsubscribed.  I was just charged $129 yesterday without knowing this would happen and the app FAQs say they refuse to provide any refund after the initial trial period has ended.  Shame on them for engaging in predatory subscription practices.

Now I am left with a half-functioning app that I fully paid for, and right back to piling on the pounds. How ironic that an app built around supporting people would have the actual worst support team.

Deleting the app isn’t enough, you have to cancel through Apple. I racked up 3 months of fees at $44 a month before I realized what was going on. Worse, you can’t contact Noom directly and Apple automatically rejects the refund request. Very misleading and disappointing

They do it even before the trial period ends. The advice is contrived, canned, and generic. In a word, experience has been terrible.

They automatically charge you without any warning. $129 for 4 months for use of an app that just sends you messages about things you already know if exorbitant & predatory.

The information they send you is very basic.

If you miss canceling before your trial period, no refund! Plus you still have to message your robot coach to cancel the auto-renewal. Developers built a great app but the business side is not customer-centric. If they were, you could manage your own account and not have to pay $140 up front.

They give you no warning prior to the end of trial period before your credit card gets charged! I have been sick and not following on the app, was expecting an email or text to confirm wanting to continue with this program!! $150 dollars later and I’m stuck with something that I did not want to continue with! Be careful  and make note of the date your trial period ends!!

The 1star rating is I went to cancel and it was few days passed my trial period and they did send message of confirmation of cancellation but my cc has already been charged for 4months. And that’s when they will cancel subscription. So I’ve sent email asking to be charged for 1 month. Let’s see what they do.

When you sign up, there’s obviously a free trial period. However Noom does not give you a heads up that they’re about to take $237 out of your account for a 7 month subscription AUTOMATICALLY after the trial ends. I really liked the app, but not enough to spend $237

Over priced calorie counting app. I believe the counselors have robotic like/ canned answers. Therefore I attempted to cancel after the two week trial period but was ignored. I received the cancellation notification conveniently after the first of the month thus I was billed for an entire month that I was not going to use. Try free apps like Lose It or My Fitness Pal same principle without the scam.

While paying for the trial period Noom clearly states that we will not be charged without consent for a continued service. I did not like the tedious process of Noom so I did not worry about canceling explicitly. Now this morning I am charged $179. It’s a honey trap with regular service like other free apps on the store. Don’t get deceived like me and get trapped. Do not loose your money.

                      Title: This really is different. It WORKS!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I've spent most of my life struggling with weight and uncomfortable in my own skin. At one point I tried to go it alone. FitBit (with good dietary choices and regular exercise) helped me get down to 250 lbs from my heaviest at 425. That's all well and good, but the weight started to creep back on after a Christmas at the inlaws where all good eating habits and my exercise routine went out the window. The weight slowly and surely crept back until I was once again above 300, then around 350. I hung around 350 lbs for quite a long time, then the pandemic hit. Between the stress of moving for a new job (JUST prior to March 2020) and then being locked indoors for an indeterminate period of time, my weight shot right back up to my heaviest (plus a couple pounds) at 427. Once 2021 came along, I realized (again) that I HAD to take the weight off and keep it off. My BP and cholesterol were both elevated. My previous doctor, my mother, my new doctor, and multiple friends all mentioned Noom. I thought it was too good to be true, but if that many unconnected people mention something, well...maybe there was something to it. All that to say, the #NoomNerds are VERY up front about the fact that it isn't magic. It's PSYCHOLOGY. Well, whatever it is, it works. It's not about cutting out foods you love or grinding yourself to the bone with extra exercise-It's about being CONSCIOUS of the choices you make, why you make them, and giving you the tools to make healthier choices without feeling deprived of things you enjoy. You set your own realistic goals and pace.  It requires two things on your part...an open mind, and a belief that you CAN do this! If you're on the fence, just go for it. What have you got to lose (besides the weight)!

                      Title: Call me hopeful!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Started Noom a little over a month ago and have lost 10 pounds. But that’s not why I’m hopeful.  I’m not a yo-yo dieter. I’m 70 years old and while I’ve tried various things over the years, my go to has always been WW. I had gained weight when raising my children and somehow those pounds never really went away and no matter what - my weight remained stubbornly too high for my height and certainly for my health. WW with its focus on points was not really working for me. I’m a “basically” healthful eater but the point system somehow let me “get away with” my poor portion control. While Noom assigns foods into categories (like WW and other diets) to help you make choices, it’s daily focus is portion control (along with multiple other factors of course, i.e. excercise) because you watch the calories add up. Calories - not points. That feels more intuitive for me. Also, listening to the multiple, psychologically based, lessons a day keeps my intention up front and center. A form of mindfulness as it were. I’m a psychologist. What I’m hearing is already familiar. But HEARING it in a pleasant, informative and sometimes humorous way is incredibly helpful and actually enjoyable. I’m primarily an auditory learner. This works beautifully for me. I start listening in the a.m. while getting ready for work and log in periodically through the day.

                      Title: $1 a Day...Totally Worth It
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I started my “free trial” one week ago and I’m happily surprised at how much progress I’ve made and how useful and different this program has been already. I’ve already changed how I am eating and exercising and I’ve learned a lot about myself and my relationship with food. The psychology piece has been really helpful and I think will help me maintain the changes I’m making. Customer service and coaching has been great so far, contrary to some other reviews I’ve read. They must have made some changes since those reviews were written. Sign up was easy, I’ve enjoyed the readings and have used and liked the recipes I’ve tried so far. Noom syncs great with my Health app for tracking my steps (I use Pedometer ++ and love it.) I haven’t been assigned to a group yet (starts after my 2 week trial period ends) but that seems like it will be another important piece to help me sustain the progress I’m making. I did order an “add on” (weekly personalized meal + workout plan) and didn’t find these particularly impressive or a good fit for me and was disappointed. BUT... I was amazed and delighted with the response I got when I asked for a refund. Refund given, NO QUESTIONS ASKED, and very courteous customer service representative. Noom has room to grow and improve but I am delighted with what is already offered and things I’ve learned about myself and eating and the progress I’ve already made (while still in the trial period!) Noom “gets me” and how my brain works with respect to food, exercise, habits. No guilt or shame at all. How freeing! I’m optimistic that Noom can give me the tools to create a new, more conscious and loving relationship with my physical self.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I gained 10 lbs in two months after having minor elective foot surgery.  I have another month before walking restrictions are lifted.  I had to do something and thought I’d check Noom out.  I had never weighed daily or logged food and wasn’t happy about it.  I did it anyway.  The positive reinforcement and focus on nutrition with excellent guidelines keep me focused on my goal.  My goal is not to lose weight.  My goal is to climb a mountain that’s in my backyard.  It’s only a four mile hike but I see that mountain almost everyday and I thought it was impossible.  I’ve lost nine lbs in one month, 40 to go.  I am 65 and have arthritis in my knee that can be problematic so not positive I can climb the last 50 feet to the peak.  But I am confidant I can make it up there if I do a little uphill walking training and take it slow. I have eaten pretty much everything.  I am enjoying delicious food, sandwiches on Dave’s Killer bread, whole wheat pita with meat and veggie shish kabobs, homemade beef barley soup, I’ve had chocolates and cookies and gelato in moderation.  I switched to 1% milk in my lattes, I enjoyed a delicious burger 7% lean on whole wheat bun.  Skipped cheese and mayo and fries.  It’s not just salads, it’s mindful eating with a focus on why we choose food based on habits and environment.  Can’t say enough about how it’s helping me.  And yeah, I’m willing to pay a buck a day to get healthy and feel good about myself!  Less than the cost of one soda or candy bar.

                      Title: Great Daily Info! (but no Disability work out)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This App is truly Awesome! The daily info on loosing weight lists all the physical & mental blocks that can disparage your progress. They teach tools that give you the ability to anticipate what to expect both positive & negative on your road to shedding those dastardly LB’s. Throw Out All the Norms or preconceived notions about why we gain weight? Or “Why” it’s more difficult for some over others to loose it? All the factors involved w/weight loss can be extremely technical but they boil it all down for simple mental digestion. You can get as much or as little help as you want/need. You get a Group Couch & a Personal Coach to help you navigate the in’s/outs as well as the ups/downs. They help you with psych tricks to stay motivated but also teach you how to sustain the weight loss after you’ve reached your goal. This aspect is way more important because about 85% of those who loose weight end up gaining part/all or more back later. Talk about self- defeating! With that in mind Noom has been the best help for me than all the others I’ve tried. The only negative I have found is that the extra work out program I bought (I thought was designed “Just for Me” wasn’t) isn’t doable for me because Im physically Disabled. I did list that I had difficulty doing several things as I have FMS/MFS=Fibromyalgia. There are days I can’t even get out of bed due to the excruciating pain in my joints. I’m in my 50’s med height at 5’7”, my muscles are hard as rocks because of the Calcium Phosphates built up in them. Believe me they’re Not hard because of muscle mass! Ha! I wish! My most difficult issue is trying to exercise because I hurt all the time. I’ve had to figure out my own way to be active in burning cals during the day so that add-on isn’t a plus for me or anyone in my similar situation. The weight I gained was due to Medication I had to take for several different Health issues over the past 10yrs. Due to Endometriosis & Fibroid tumors I had an early Hysterectomy. So the Hormone pills caused huge weight gain as well as Breast Cancer. Not from over eating as that’s never been my thing. But this is the 1st x I’m learning about how my Hormones, lack of Sleep & Metabolism have all worked against me. Noom teaches how foods fit in 3 categories. “Green” is for Fruits n Veggies, “Yellow” is for Proteins & “Red” is for Fats, Breads, all processed foods & Sweets. The best thing about understanding how the color system works is learning to balance your intake of a daily calorie allotment. There R No “Bad” foods at Noom. They Don’t criticize you for your food choices. They encourage you to learn portion control for higher cal foods but you can also go nuts & eat all the greens n protein you want! Logging your meals is way easy & shows the calories for every item under the sun. If it isn’t listed then you can log the info to help build their Calorie Liabrary of foods. I find that being with Noom has increased my determination to stick to my goals. The support system is by far the best I’ve ever experienced & everyone including your group members are so kind/encouraging! I hope this review answers “?”’s for those who are on the fence about joining. For me financial elements kept me from signing up sooner so when I saw an 80% off sign up I pounced! I’m on week 5 & Im very glad I signed up for the year to get the lowest price. It’s sure better than any gym membership I’ve joined & subsequently stopped using after a month. This is life changing!!!😊I’m on my way to thinner days! Thanks Noom! PS Yes, I’m a Poet/Writer Ha!

                      Title: Interesting app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I found this app really interesting, though ultimately it wasn’t for me. I cancelled after 1.5weeks to make sure I didn’t forget and get charged after the 2 week trial. I liked the daily CBT “lessons” and reminders to stay on track. I have no idea long-term how those lessons develop or how long I would continue to read them. None of the information was new to me, but I did find it helpful to be reminded of certain behavioral concepts in the context of weight loss and to be guided through setting goals. The lessons were written in a very “cute” style with plenty of jokes and hashtags. I love silly jokes so those made smile, and the hashtags and “cute” style weren’t so annoying to offend me. I appreciated the interactions with my goal specialist who helped me work through my first goal. Having a personal health coach is the part of the app that I found to be most worth paying for, in addition to daily guidance from the lessons, but my understanding is after the first week there is only a brief weekly interaction with the goal specialist. In the trial period I didn’t get to experience the coaching group, but I’m probably not the type that would be interested in keeping up with that. The meal logging is where Noom is really lacking, especially compared to calorie tracking veteran My Fitness Pal. It’s clunky to have to open the section back up after every meal you log, making it frustrating to log multiple meals/snacks at once or going back to make changes/correct mistakes. Navigating away from the app even for a moment will redirect you to the home page, and you will lose all your progress in logging a meal or in reading through a course if you hadn’t completed it yet. I know myself and over time I would get fed up with this. There’s no nutrient breakdown for foods, only a green-yellow-red color label system. This makes it difficult to know if you’re really choosing the best foods for your own particular body if you require any kind of custom diet. Given my experience, Noom came nowhere near being worth the price offered.

                      Title: Not impressed yet
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I took a chance with this since I’d like to drop a few pandemic pounds. I’m a 40 year old man and I’d say I’m 50% enjoying it. I like logging meals: charting progress, etc is “for me”. I hate the articles and affirmations. I’m sure this is based on Noom’s market feedback and algorithms, but everything seems to be geared towards a woman who works at Dunder Mifflin paper company. I am not that. The language is cheesy, the handwritten affirmations are a deterrent, and the jokes are bad. Content and quizzes are geared towards “break room” environments which I’ve never had, and I’m guessing no one has for about a year, and they fail to account for other experiences. For that matter, suggesting relaxing vacations or staycations during a pandemic is clearly an oversight on their part, and please don’t tell me to pray! (They have shoehorned an article about stress eating during Covid). After making one recipe from the app I found that the nutrition info listed on the recipe is NOT the same as the nutrition information when you log in your meals so that’s a huge error and provides zero confidence. The recipe also felt half-written and the nutrition logged different herbs and dairy than the ingredient list (parsley not dill, cheese not yogurt). Will require a lot of checking back and forth if I ever want to use their recipes again.

                      Title: Customer Support: 👎🏻
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a phenomenal weight loss tool that is being held back by its lack of customer support. I’ve tried so many programs, both on my own and ones that require an app or a meeting, etc. This one actually works. I love that the science behind weight loss is shared on a daily basis with users and that there is validation that weight loss isn’t easy and there’s no magic formula that makes it that way. This truly is a program that aims to educate and promote lifelong, sustainable habits that lead to a healthy weight and lifestyle. However, their customer support is severely lacking. Personal coaching is touted as a main feature of this app. Where is it? My group receives what appear to be automated articles and challenges daily, but after two weeks (ironically once my free trial was up and I started paying for the program) my “personal coach” has disappeared. I have some operational questions about the app that I can’t get answers to and the “Help” section is no help at all. This is a problem, Noom! This is a paid program that is developed by what appears to be highly intelligent and well trained people in the field of weight loss. I will stick with the program because the weight loss portion does work. I don’t want my money back and would recommend this program to others. But I would appreciate a response from the developer. One that isn’t automated as it appears the other developer responded see I’ve read seem to be.

I thought I gave this app the 7 day trial period and checked what was about. But unfortunately during trial period I had a family emergency and got caught up with that  which it didn’t gave me time to really look into the app. I even had it scheduled in my agenda to cancel it the day of the ending trial period. So as soon as I arrived home (about 2-3 hours late) I tried to cancel it but I immediately noticed I had already been charged $160 for a 6 month subscription plan! Seriously??!!! Not much longer than 2-3 hours after the trial period had passed. So I immediately contacted them and explained what had happened, and asked to please issue me a refund as I didn’t have a chance to even look into the app, plus I told them I wasn’t really going to be using this app due to the lack of time. I also told them I simply didn’t seen that I’d was going to be immediately charged/signed up for $160 for a six month subscription plan if I missed the cancel date!

                      Title: Good Approach in an Imperfect Package
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been using this for about a month and a half. I have lost a couple of pounds in that time, which is good considering that period included Christmas, Thanksgiving, my birthday, and New Year’s Eve. What I like about Noom is the structure and the fact that it embeds information about nutrition and behavior change into the process. It’s incredibly easy to commit to reading articles on a regular basis because they’re short and they’re limited (you can’t just binge through them all in a day). It really focuses on “progress not perfection” which is really important for achieving things long term. I have issues with building habits that stick, but the way this app works makes it easy to keep with it on some level, such as just by reading articles or logging food, even when it’s hard to fully engage every aspect. This makes it easier to come back to doing more within the app when you’re ready, rather than just forgetting about it altogether.

                      Title: Noom is not what they say it is
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been on Noom since Jan 11 and have lost about 12 pounds. I have 50 pounds left so I have a lot of weight to lose. The Noom daily lessons are good for the most part. However, the coaching is virtually non- existent and not at all what Noom leads you to believe in their advertising. My coach rarely reaches out to me and this is the second coach I’ve had so far. And when they do reach out it’s not proactive. It’s usually to answer a question. So the coaching aspect is highly disappointing. Also, there is zero nutritional analysis on the app.  It’s impossible to know how much micronutrients you’re getting i.e., protein, carbs and fats. That’s vital and completely missing from the app. There’s a daily lesson on increasing protein, in fact, which makes the point about not having a way of know ones daily protein intake that much sharper. To just tell users to increase protein can result in users getting kidney stones since there’s no way for them to know how much protein they’re getting. Perhaps they’re already at their limit. In that sense I find it reprehensible and irresponsible for Noom to be making medical recommendations. Now that Noom charged me the full amount I will keep going since it’s expensive and I don’t want it all to be for nothing. What’s making a difference for me is weighing myself daily and logging my food daily. I can do that on virtually any other weight loss app and also get the benefit of knowing my macros. It’s for those reasons that I cannot recommend Noom.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I signed up for the two week trial late one night and decided to give it more than two weeks. I thought billing was monthly, there was no clear conversation about a contract...and I got trapped. If you have ever had an eating disorder or are vulnerable to eating disorders, quit. This app supports black and white think about types of foods (red, yellow, green...). Because they don’t know much about Participants, the plans are Broad stroked. If you have metabolic issues, older...it won’t be taken into account. The app itself is a little outdated (which is ironic because they make fun of weight watchers saying it’s an old program). It’s eh. If you have never used a good app like spark people, you won’t even notice. He exercise part of the app doesn’t allow for miles to be entered or make distinctions between types of similar activities. The food log is ok. When spark people was new, I was I putting nutritional data constantly because foods just wouldn’t show up in their library. Now...same with Noom. I end up using a similar food because I just don’t have time to input info. I’m paying for this right???  The couch is good. It’s clear there is a lot of automated responding but when she does pipe in, it’s solid. Clearly well trained in CBT and motivational interviewing. Also clear that they are instructed not to spend to much time engaging with people, especially if there is an actual issue. Maybe it’s my fault for not having read the small print but I do feel ripped off. It’s expensive for what it is. Weight watchers has a good app. Spark people is fantastic (breaks down nutritional info much much better) and is FREE. So don’t be an idiot like me. Read before you jump Im and if it fits for you—awesome and good luck

Sometimes only a few sentences of information a question asking about motivation. You see this almost daily. Useless I’m my opinion. Talked about breathing through stress, not what I joined for.

                      Title: FYRE FESTIVAL OF WEIGHT LOSS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Think twice before you buy their 16 week program.  Their selling point is the support of a coach and community to help on your journey.  It starts off fine, but then once your two week trial period is over and you can no longer get a refund, they start switching your coach and group out every few weeks, which is not at all helpful and is actually damaging to your efforts to establish healthier habits.  Their customer support is completely non responsive.  Additionally, the app does not sync well with Health Kit and Apple Watch.  It double counts calories burned, giving you the false sense that you can eat more than you actually can - you may actually gain weight.  Weight loss is hard - you are better off doing it on your own and knowing that, than the false promise of support from Noom.  Try one of the free apps, at least they are up front with what they provide!!!  Do you research.  Company stops responding once they have your money.

                      Title: unreliable app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I will start by saying that that I was running this on the latest version of the iOS, on an iPhone 8 Plus.  Coincidentally, a bug fix update for iPhone X has just been released, so I suspect these things might go away eventually.  his app needs a lot of work before Noom starts charging for it.  In the 2-week trial period, I had numerous problems like freezing when sending a message through the app, to inconsistent data, to unavailable data, etc.  I reported all of it and got very prompt and consistent feedback from support.  However, in the end, I was told that I’m the only person reporting these problems and they will unlikely be fixed, so I cancelled.  Here’s just one example:

                      Title: What a joke
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I signed up for this app thinking that I would have a coach to give me personalized advice regarding my food choices and a group of peers for motivation.  The coach did ZERO coaching, simply "checked in" to see how I was doing, but never gave advice.  I was shuffled around to different groups every other week so I could never get the benefit of a consistent group environment.  I went out of the country for two weeks and was unable to contribute to group discussions, so I was banished to the "group" for inactive members.  There is no coach and I get notifications literally every ten minutes when other banished members are added to the group.  The only way to cancel is to contact your coach - but there is no coach in this group.  RUN FROM THIS APP.  I guarantee you'll lose more weight that way anyway...  To the developers - is this legal?  There's no way to cancel?

                      Title: A decent food tracker but that’s about it
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have tried so many different weight loss diets/methods/approaches and really hoped this one would be different with its claim to help change your habits. The food tracker works quite well (hence the 2 stars) but most of the articles are too rudimentary for most people who’ve already been on a long health journey. Plus I found contradictions in their suggestions and WAY too many actionable items each day. Most of the people in my assigned group have given up on the daily prompts and just ignore the coach because her prompts don’t match the articles for the day. It’s all very overwhelming and disappointing. Wish I had asked for my money back during the trial period. I don’t recommend this app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I purchased this app. Opened it once (maybe twice) and decided it wasn't for me. I didn't get any push notifications from the app and ultimately forgot about it until $150 was charged to my bank account. It took me two tries to make contact with someone to cancel my account and ask for my money back since I never used any features and was told their refund policy did not allow that because the trial period ended. I don't appreciate sneaky tactics for people to profit off of people's health.

Although many things could be added to the app, like bug fixes, the ability to mark your progress over periods of time, and to look back into your food log, I am overall pleased with the app. I think many food options could be added but this app has already helped me loose 7 pounds in one week.

They totally dupe you! I was all about the first two weeks: fun interactive lessons that stick with you. I should have cancelled during the free trial period. I decided to let them charge me and well what do you know? Week three is half-hazard lessons. No more interaction. Super short, not fun at all. The program is completely different once you’re locked in to paying for the rest of the 16 weeks. Buyer be ware! What you see during the free trial is NOT what the rest of the program is like! 👎👎👎

Barcode scanner doesn't work. After spending 30 mins manually inputting my food the app didn't even post any of it. I was asked about sodium amount when inputting my food but I can't track sodium consumption. The old app had a pie chart that showed you how you were doing in regards to red, yellow, and green foods. Been using the free version for 3 years. I have walked away from the app because food tracking shouldn't take forever.

I downloaded the trial version and didn't liked the concept at all, nothing personal about it, nothing I wasn't doing already with other apps. Unfortunately I was in jury duty and because of the change in routine I forgot to cancel before the expiration of the trial period. Lost $99 that could have used toward a gym!!!!! If you want to try, it make sure you set up an alarm to cancel it, otherwise you will lose your money.

Excelente el equipó de Noom. No comprendo porque hay comentarios negativos. Cuando te inscribes te explican claramente que el periodo de prueba es por 7 días y el pago es en dólares o euros. En mi caso pague 199 USD por un año de tratamiento, mucho más barato a largo plazo a comparación de la opción mensual de pago. El cobro es hecho al finalizar tu período de prueba como te explican al principio. Incluso recibí un correo al principio con todos los detalles. Increíble programa si lees los términos.

Noom is an example of classic bait & switch.    During the free trial period, the lessons are all accompanied by terrific narration performed by a team of talented and diverse professional narrators.      The lessons were valuable, and it was that narration that made them so. The fact that they were obviously paying skilled readers led me to believe Noom would be worth the subscription cost.

One star is too many! When people sign up Noom entices you with a “free trial”. I quickly realized the day I signed up that Noom was not for me. Listening to a bunch of monotone people give me “motivational” speeches is not going to get anyone off the couch! So, I canceled the same day so I would not be charged $125.10. Nope, that’s not how Noom works. IF you cancel BEFORE the free trial period they automatically charge you! Of course their keyboard Karens behind the online customer support feature were ZERO help! My advice, DON’T SIGN UP!

Easy to use and a friendly app. The bar code scanner doesn’t work all that great. The big thing missing, with Noom, is there is no way to track your nutritional value for a given day, week, etc. Meaning, there is no way to see tracking how much sodium, fat, etc that you consume in a day. In my opinion, this seems like something critical that is needed for a diet.

The daily lessons, the coach, the social support of the group all make for a fantastic program. My only complaint is the food logging. Unlike MyFitnessPal, you cannot see all of your days food in one screen. You also can’t see the color code of the food you choose until after you have logged it. Lastly, it is not easy to see what your macro and micro nutrients are for each meal and for the day, the only numbers you easily see are calories.
