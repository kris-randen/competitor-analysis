--------------------------------------------------------------------

An app that can change course and set it right to improve and build health and fitness and also to an extent remove the daily pill for sugar and blood pressure by combining diet and exercise .  Healthify studio brings in the expert coach home to get you fit and strong.  I love the features of the app and am a great fan.  The health records enable one to quantify progress made over time on key parameters, tracking health progress with proper diet and exercise .  A supporting tool for all who wish to make drastic improvements to pave way for great health and fitness . What endears me the most is the new feature -  ‚Äòinsights‚Äô that provides info on micro and macro nutrients after each meal, day after day informing and enabling the  actions that can be taken to improve health.  I live all the features of the app that inspires, informs, motivates and easily the best to gain and achieve great health results .

                      Title: Best health app ever used
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have dabbled with quite a few calorie counter apps for quite some time. I have tried the so called most popular ones in Appstore but nothing beats this Period. The USP of this app is its extensive database it has got every variety of local food you usually eat along with nutritional info. Hats off thats an achievement in itself. Not to mention the integrators and the coach plans. The integrators integrate with default health app of iOS and tells you the calories you run/walk. Big kudos to the dev team keep it this way don‚Äôt change anything..!!!

                      Title: Recent update is not good
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Your app basically solved a very good purpose of tracking our daily eating habbits and the calorie intake as well as it suggesting the right amount of calorie intake wether to put on weight or lose it and it was really helpfull because "it helped keep track over a long period  of time, we could go back to a previous date " but after your recent update, one cannot go back to a previous date to modify any dietary change or to look back at any particular meal of the previous so many days.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is probably the best in the field. Their expert professionals are able to help in terms of diet, workouts (prescribed and the ones in studio), mental health, etc. The calorie tracker tracks macros and micronutrients, it works in tandem with built in phone apps for health. And the trainers are always working towards individual goals for the users. The weight loss/strength training is gradual, healthy and aims at lifestyle change. Their methods are not hearsay and are properly researched and executed by trained professionals.

                      Title: Very Helpful
--------------------------------------------------------------------

HealthifyMe application is very helpful for your weightloss journey. Diet plan is spot on keeping in mind the macro and micronutrients. The diet coach makes sure you be on track with regular calls and checks. Fatima Adam has been very kind and helpful as my diet coach. Workout plan is also good but it gets a little repetitive over the course of a month. If a doctor on call could be included in the package it would really help in case of injuries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Its truly an excellent app with almost every indian food in the catalogue. The breakup for all the macronutrients and micronutrients truly helps to modify the diet. Only glitch with the app stays to be too many ads....if the ads can be limited to some extent...it will honestly be one of the best apps in the market.
