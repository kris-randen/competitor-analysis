                      Title: NOOM has changed my life
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was skeptical to start a program like NOOM because of the price and because I didn’t know if it would work for me. I have struggled with weight for most of my adult life and it has not been easy for me to lose weight. I am entering week nine in the NOOM program and have lost 12 pounds! While this may not seem like much, it is weight that I have not been able to lose on my own. I am a registered nurse and I feel that a slower, steady weight loss is a healthier way to go. I have seen many others in my life lose and then gain right back. The program has been so helpful in many ways. I like the fact that there’s really nothing that you can’t eat in the program, but more like how much you eat of it. The program breaks down for you the three levels of food and how much you should be eating in each of those categories. It has been more of a lifestyle change and making you aware of what you were actually eating. I really love the program. I think that it is really great to have a coach and a support team to reach out to 24 hours a day, and to also have recipes recommended by the program. I invited a friend to join the program as well and she really enjoyed it but she ended with her trial due to the pricing for her. I have a ways to go to meet my goal, but I am off to a great start thanks to NOOM! So I give this program five stars, but if it were just slightly less expensive, more people could benefit from it.

                      Title: It WORKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are willing to commit and put in the work, this is definitely the best app to help you achieve your goals! I initially had no faith in myself that I would lose any weight at all, but the way they set up their articles to educate you on how to live a healthier lifestyle is encouraging and inspiring and if you are willing to receive all the “tools” they give you to succeed you definitely will!!! I recommend this to everyone who has asked me what I’ve been doing to lose weight! I started the program 3 1/2 months ago and I’m down 30 lbs and pushing closer to 35....10 lbs a month of healthy weight loss!! I’m a registered nurse and I thought I knew a lot about nutrition and what’s good and bad, but I’m not a nutritionist so I found out I was wrong about a lot of things about healthy eating. Starting this journey has honestly been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made!!! I feel so much healthier and more energetic, and I still have more weight I’d like to lose, so I’m gonna continue with this new lifestyle change bc it’s just that....it’s not a diet... it’s a new way of thinking about food and exercise and your body as a whole! LOVE THIS APP MILLION! I will be sad to end my journey and fly solo, but when that day happens I know they have given me so many things to help me continue on my own!!!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

                      Title: Life Changing! Worth every penny!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I started Noom in June of 2019, weighing 165 lbs and wanting to get in shape after recovering from ACL surgery and knew it would be easier if I were thinner. But isn’t that to story of my life. Everything would be easier if I were less heavy. I could move easier, fit in to more clothes and wear what I wanted. Those were things I’ve wanted for years. I’ve been a little overweight since I was about 13 years old. Always about 20/30 lbs more than where I needed to be. I even had someone ask me once when I was in my 20s if I was pregnant, I nearly died. I’ve tried Nutrisystem and Weight Watchers, fad shakes and everything that I could find, but nothing really worked. Until Noom. I learned about my relationship with food. I learned about what I was choosing to eat and why. It changed my entire view about what I can eat and when I should eat it and why I should it. I lost 30 lbs and met my goal in four months. When my subscription automatically renewed, I emailed and asked for a refund, which they provided immediately. I’m now at 135 and maintaining my weight right where I want it to be using the tools I got with Noom. If you are even thinking about wanting to lose weight and change your life, don’t wait! Do it. This is a great program!!

                      Title: Depends what you’re looking for
--------------------------------------------------------------------

My honest review after completely the two week trial (and deciding not to move forward) is, it really depends on what you are looking for. I was looking for something to jumpstart my post-pregnancy weight loss, but being a health coach myself and having successfully lost weight in the past I found myself really bored with the reading. No matter what ‘level’ you’re at, even though you fill out questionnaires in the beginning to determine what your lifestyle is like, you’re starting from square one. So that wasn’t useful for me. Then there are the coaches. I got a message from my coach after about four days, responded back to him within minutes, then never heard back. I reached out to Noom after two more days asking if the coach was a real person or a bot, that’s how ‘automated’ his message to me sounded. And how are you supposed to get anywhere if it takes the coach two days to get back to you every time? They assigned me a new coach but the same thing happened again. So in my two week trial, I never really had an interaction with a coach at all. So that didn’t work for me either. What did work for me was the food analysis, where you log your meals and get an immediate response based on a grading system. I loved that aspect of it, but for the price it’s not worth it to me to keep it just for that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve had a pretty positive experience with the program so far. My goal was to lose some weight postpartum but I didn’t want to be on a diet, per se. I’ve lost 7 lbs in 22 days so far just from being more mindful about my eating and making a point of moving more. No big changes or sacrifices. I’ve been pleasantly surprised.

                      Title: Usefulness quickly exhausted
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I found this program to be very helpful for about six weeks, but after that it seemed repetitive and lacking in the area of tracking growth and progress. The coaching was not at all helpful, and the groups were not as active/supportive as I would have hoped - just a bunch of twee housemoms regurgitating get-healthy cliches. I can imagine most of them identify strongly with the classic stock photo, “Woman Smiling Over Salad”. My biggest issue with this program is the oversimplification of food - it’s either green, yellow or red. There is no way to track macros, which is pretty freaking important to do if you’re trying to lose significant weight, because your body won’t get the point unless you’re feeding it the right amount of protein, carbs and fats for your body weight. Once I started tracking my macros in another app, my metabolism finally kicked into high gear. I’m not mad that I started with noom, because as I said, it WAS useful for a minute, but I wish I had known more about the structure of the program before buying an 8-month subscription, which they refuse to let me donate to someone who may need it more. Also, the harassing texts to sign back in after I have asked multiple times to have alerts turned off, is getting pretty freaking annoying.

                      Title: This criticism for the developers ONLY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve had a tremendous, life changing experience with Noom in the last 9 months and lost a 1/4 of my total weight. The concept is brilliant and I can’t recommend it enough. With that being said: I’ve never seen an app with more nuisances when it come to recording data.  So many food color groups are marked wrong and have irrelevant measuring sizes or food are duplicated several times with slightly different name but for the same product. One will have a tbsp and the other won’t. Constantly going back and forth. But the MOST frustrating part is the fact the the “easy units” calories screen does not corresponds to the “other units” screen. In one page 1 cup of Silk Soy milk can show 100 calories while on the other it will show 34 calories. Funny how it’s called “easy units”. My guess is that many people do not reach their goals or give up because they trust the measurements provided by the lack of checks and balances at Noom. This issue is present across MANY food items and has been so for the 9 months I’ve been on.  If a single programmer that cares would actually use Noom themselves the many annoying issues would be obvious after one day. So with everything i said and my love to Noom I’m afraid that a competition that will create a good working app will be a serious threat to the viability of this company.

                      Title: Amazing program that works!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I never thought I would be this weight again. I have lost 16 pounds in three months and continue to use noom. The fact that it focuses on psychology and our erroneous mental concepts regarding not just food but self-concept in general has COMPLETELY shifted how I look at food and weight. Some people may be turned off by the cost, but I’ll tell you, I was glad to pay it. The fact that I paid money gave me more of an initial push to see it through. I was desperate and, though I really couldn’t afford it, I told myself I have to do something and I pressed the OK button before I could talk myself out of it, and it was the best $100 I have ever spent. I am back to the weight I was before I was pregnant and can fit in all my old clothes. When I started I had one pair of pants I could fit in. Now I stop and look when I pass a mirror wondering if I’m dreaming. I stare at the scale and think it must be wrong! I have tried other diets, even one I loved, but noom is the first eating plan that has not made me feel deprived. I have learned so much about myself. I could have never accomplished any of this without noom.

                      Title: While I don’t use it anymore, it got me on a path of success!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I started using Noom in August of 2019, and I didn’t even spend a dime. It gave me a simple easy to understand recap of the foods I ate, and didn’t make me feel bad when I messed up. You can track your food, your weight, and your steps. It helps you take your baby steps into the world of fitness. With Noom, I went from 172lbs to 144lbs over a course of 7 months, and I know that sounds like a long time, but I didn’t exercise right up until February. I lost 20 pounds from August to December. I’m not too big of a guy, I’m only 16 to be honest and I probably shouldn’t have been using this app. But it really did change my life. Eventually after a few months of using this app, I stopped because it became a habit and a lifestyle to be healthy. It taught me that you don’t have to rush things. I do run almost everyday now, but that’s my choice, and you don’t have to exercise and eat well and be overwhelmed in your first few months. I still come back every now and again just to record my progress. Thank you guys so much for making this app!!!!

Perhaps it is a bit premature to review at 3 weeks but when you pay for something you have expectations. I find the light hearted humor fun and engaging. I like the format and I have been weighing in and logging most meals, but there are some major drawbacks. I’ll cover those here: INACCURATE! I would estimate that greater than 50% of the foods I scanned with a UPC come up with the wrong calories per serving (cottage cheese, frosted mini wheats, Chobani yogurt and milk! To name a few.) additionally the servings are not the primary mode of listing, weird!  It once prompted me for 2 slices of something like yogurt? The accuracy here is much worse than My Fitness Pals free service.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a second time Noomer. The first time I lost about 25 lbs in 4 months. I was purposefully moving slowly because I was nursing my baby and didn’t want to stop producing for him. I took a break and luckily didn’t gain weight and tried to keep up with the principles.  Now I’m a month into round 2 and another 13 lbs gone! In addition to Noom, I’ve been seeking ways to be at peace and love myself more and it’s all coming together. While many people are stress eating and drinking their way through 2020, I’m happy that I will be starting 2021 healthier and happier despite the stresses we have all been through. If you don’t think it’s possible to lose weight while you’re stressed, I suggest giving it a try. I’m a healthcare worker who has now had 2 family members require life support for COVID and I have a  1 yr old and a 3 yr old which makes life busy. No matter what you are going through, you can do it and a program like Noom can help you get there!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I did Noom faithfully for six weeks, hoping it would be the key to the last few pounds of postpartum weight loss. Nope! Lost net one pound. This app isn’t built for breastfeeding moms or people who already are fairly food-savvy (e.g. eating scrambled eggs and avocado for breakfast, eschewing processed food, never drinking soda, etc.) It’s sneaky and bad at it, which bugs me (“we’re psychology nerds!” “red doesn’t mean bad!” um, yes it does. Stop, wrong way, rewrite this paragraph... it’s keyed into our brains that red means bad.) They have no idea what to do with breastfeeding, no setting for that - even set to the slowest weight loss speed, I needed probably at least 300 more calories than they allowed. Some of their daily lessons were interesting, but most rehashed things I already knew (cucumbers are a better snack than brownies? Restaurant food has lots of extra calories?? Shock and horror.)

                      Title: May work for some but I’m disappointed
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ll start by saying 1) I did not use the actual 1:1 coach as I loathe the idea of someone pestering me regularly and 2) this may work for SOME people. A lot of the information presented is really helpful. However, like most programs it’s a bit of a “one size fits all” approach to the automated portion. The food logger is really awkward (default serving sizes seem arbitrary), and some “red yellow green” designations make no sense whatsoever and there is no explanation for why something (IE whole milk plain yogurt) is RED and a similar item (IE whole milk sugar sweetened vanilla yogurt) is YELLOW for the same serving size. The calorie counter is difficult to get to and to read. I get this is more of a “healthy relationship with food” system. But, if one of your goals is weight loss, an option to put your red/yellow/green counts front and center (without having to click multiple times) may be something you should be able to do. I do not believe the cost is worth continuing this subscription. If it works for you, amazing! It just wasn’t for me. Best of luck to all!

I’ve only been using Noom for a month, but I can tell it’s already teaching me how to change my eating habits in order to lose weight.  I’ve always been good at exercising and generally eating healthy, but had reached a plateau after having a baby.  This program opened my eyes to where I needed to adjust my eating habits, and pay closer attention to WHAT I was eating.  I’ve lost weight and can see how it will help me long-term!:).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I got Noom to try to lose the last bit of baby weight. Logging is easy, articles are informative, but I can do that for free on other apps. What I really wanted was the coaching. What I got was a weekly email that said “just checking in.” I’d ask a question and it would take at least a day to get answered. I get that people only work certain hours but it’s an app, not a gym. Someone should be available to answer questions and messages beyond normal business hours. When I told my coach her “just checking in” message was insufficient, she changed nothing. Stayed on her same lazy schedule. I paid $45/month for an app on my phone that offered no more than a gym membership or free articles on the internet. Sure a personal trainer would have been more than that but at least it would have been actual training and coaching, not this garbage noom is selling. I’d love to get at least some of my money back that was wasted on this nonsense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was doing so many of the right things: eating well, drinking water, exercising 5 times a week. But I wasn’t losing weight. Noom showed me that the food you eat is a huge part of weight loss, and I needed some important tweaks in that area! Even though the foods I was eating were healthy foods, my portions of certain foods were too large. Once I learned what foods could keep me fuller for longer, and started really paying attention to my body — all of my portions overall went down. I lost 12 lbs in a month (the last time that happened, I had a baby!). Now I’m down 15 lbs and so excited to continue. The lessons on becoming self-aware about why we do what we do are key. I gave it 4 stars only because of the price, but if you are willing to make an investment in yourself, you’ll be thrilled with the results!

I started Noom November 5th 2019 and I have already lost 15lbs! All I’ve ever wanted was guidance in a lifestyle change of healthier eating habits and exercise at a reasonable pace without starving throughout the day. For years I have struggled with baby fat, depression, headaches, lack of energy and eating my emotions! So far, in just under 1 month with Noom, I have lost 15 lbs, no headaches, depression at an upswing, enjoy taking walks with my son, and eat when I am hungry and not when my emotions tell me to! I have gained back control of my life and I couldn’t be happier with the guidance and support I have gotten with Noom! Feels like I’m not even trying! If you are thinking of trying Noom just do it! If you follow their easy (almost effortless) guidance you will succeed! Go for it!

I downloaded the app after seeing multiple adds for it. I downloaded it with plans to do the free trial and then get out if I wanted, don’t even remember there being any time to input payment options. Two days after downloading the app I found out that I am pregnant. I tried to cancel my subscription that day- now even I can’t find those messages I sent to my “coach”. I think they have a filter in the messages and hide requests or something. Here I am a month and a half later and I’ve been charged $129 for my account. I did not approve of this!! I have been looking for a number to call or anything to get my account canceled and get a refund but everything is done on the app! There is no way to find my account information so I can’t unsubscribe or see purchase history! I sent an email and tried to message the coach again, these are actually showing on my messages now. I want my money back! It’s a scam people!

                      Title: So many issues with this so-called “program”
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I answered the long questionnaire, which did not ask incredibly important questions for a woman (such as whether or not I’m breastfeeding!). I answered that I preferred slow and steady to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight. I also answered that I exercise regularly. The “plan” that this set me up on was simply a calorie limit of 1200 calories a day and estimated that I would lose 20 lbs in 2 months!! There is nothing slow and steady about that and there is nothing that is remotely healthy about that excessive calorie restricting as a 31-year-old, active and nursing mother. It claims that foods are not good or bad, but then labels your food green, yellow, or red - how is that really any different? Noom claims that it’s about psychology, but the reality is that it’s built around calorie restriction like any other diet. Save your money. You don’t need this over-priced app to count your calories. There are free apps that do the same thing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ll start by saying I did lose weight using this app. About 5lbs, pretty fast. However the extreme calorie restriction coupled with bad nutrition advice resulted (I believe) in me getting very sick. I developed shingles while on this diet. I am an otherwise healthy 32 year old woman with some extra baby weight to lose and I found myself eating like an anorexic person on this diet. The “coaching” appears to be nothing but a bot with canned answers. When I tried to freeze my subscription because of my illness I was told no. When I ate normally again (like daily recommended calories well balanced diet normal) I started gaining weight again.

So I’ve done Noom now 3 times…after each of my pregnancies and it has been a wonderful gentle reset for me to make the needed changes in my eating and exercise habits, but also so much more. There is this hidden part of having a healthy and balanced relationship with food, my body, and myself in general that Noom also helps me to address. What I like is that Noom also build skills in all of these areas in a sustainable way. I feel empowered to make healthy choice while also knowing it’s ok to make mistakes and it’s absolutely necessary for me to create new ways of coping with stressful and difficult thoughts/feelings. So happy I found Noom ☺️

                      Title: Beginning NOOM
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am an informed caregiver. Through the years, snacks, meals, drinks, desserts, exercise, schedules and shopping habits have all changed. Years ago we usually drank coffee, tea, milk. OJ and water. Today we have added half and half. Flavors, syrups and whip cream to coffee. In addition, we drink two or three soft drinks, nectars and several juices. Potato, rice or similar products not once a day; possibly 3 times a day and then the snacks in that category. Portions of meat and frequency has increased and now we add all kinds of sauces and cheeses, all sorts of breads, dipping a and toppings. We haven’t even mentioned fruits, vegetables or desserts. As I lied in my bed, I was horrified in admitting our gluttony. It is no wonder  we r so obese and full of diseases. I do not know how to begin to change our mindset. Perhaps an investment in exchange for every sacrifice!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I had lost a lot of weight before and gained it back when I got pregnant. I was feeling hopeless and out of control with my eating.  I decided to take a chance and try this program since I was quarantined and the gym was closed.  I’m 5 weeks in and 9 lbs down!  I feel in control again and back on track. I think just having someone to keep me accountable has made all the difference. Some of the lessons I already knew so it was helpful to remind me and I have learned a lot of new tips and tricks. It is changing the way I think about my life and eating.  I would recommend it to anyone struggling. You only have to log on 10 min a day so it’s very doable!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I had expected this app to be better. The coaches are basically just someone who pushes a button with a pre-written script. The “tailored” curriculum is not tailored at all. The group element is equally large and unwieldy. I’m postpartum and nursing and have told the coach that numerous times. I need something more tailored, and this app is basically no better than just logging my calories myself and watching a few TED talks. But what really annoys me is that the UX of the app stinks. Why can’t I easily move logged foods to a different meal? Why don’t they add foods I scan? Why can’t I add recipes myself? The food logging part of the app lags FAR behind others, particularly MyFitnessPal — which is free. I tried to cancel my membership on week 2, and they offered my a cut rate membership. I am a sucker and stayed on, wish I had just cancelled then and there.

Easy to integrate into my life. As a mom of a 3 year old and newborn baby, I was able to start viewing the content, interact with my coach, participate in the group with my coach, and start tracking my food and weight. I felt in charge of my health plan and goals so I could customize it according to my needs. I started off my building healthier habits and then eased into the weight loss aspect. The messages are witty and intelligent. Even as a health oriented person, I’ve learned a lot and most importantly had the support to practice what I know and be accountable to my intentions. Give it a try and I’ll be you can find you’ll want to stick with it!

They use psychology and science to teach you how to eat better! I lost 30 pounds within 6 months and made friends throughout the way in my group. Customer support is very helpful and kind. I had to stop Noom because I am expecting a baby 🥳 and they do not have a program for that (yet! I hope they do someday where it involves eating healthy for momma and baby and guiding meditations etc.) anywho! I will be back! I love how My coaches were very helpful and sincere! I love how it worked and how easy it was to log food! Definitely worth the money because you lose the weight without buying shakes or special prepackaged food.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was eager to try due to the psychological approach and they talk about being a multidisciplinary team, however, with only 10 lbs to lose, it set my calories at 1200 per day. I was super low energy and hangry. As a breastfeeding 32 year old, this is barely even at my BMR. To add to it, exercise only gives you 50% of calories burned back. I found the fatigue/hanger led me to feel really miserable. They talk about wanting to be sustainable but this isn’t sustainable and the calorie goal is not customizable. Lost 3 lbs in the first week which is way too fast, second week I upped my calories by going over every day and lost just 1 which is better but I felt guilty every day bc I was “over”. Canceled at the end of week 2. Not for me. Maybe would work for someone less active?

I loved having a personal coach, though I found the group sessions to be a bit much and sometimes slightly confusing as we weren’t all on the exact same day. I’m now having a baby so had to stop using the app, but have already decided as soon as I’m able I’m going to work the program again.

                      Title: Good app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s a great application and it dives into the psychological aspect of weight loss. It also tracks steps and calorie count. The food and calorie count portion needs a lot more work. The library of recipes and foods available is very limited, you can't swipe in between days: you have to go out of the meals, switch days, go back in just to see what leftovers you’re eating. It doesn’t remember or suggest past items very well. Every day I need to scroll for coffee and a few tbsp of milk. Every day. We use Sunbasket and none of those recipes are listed. That aspect is disappointing compared with the capabilities of Lose It. Also, tracking exercise is limited in Noom. Noom has a focus on building good habits and sharing progress etc with a community.

I’ve struggled with food all my life.  I’ve tried all the weight management programs you can think of, weight watchers; Jenny craig; Atkins; Etc.  The problem with all these is they do help you loose weight but once you get there what happens is you maintain for a bit but your old habits come back and so does the weight.  Noon is all about learning new habits, learning a new relationship with food.  If you learn how deal with food with new habits it’s different.  Noon teaches you new Life long habits to help you hopefully for many healthy years to come.  I love food but I’m learning how to enjoy it without it killing me.  Baby Steps!!

Noom was amazing and I got great results and loved the program. I lost a lot of weight and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately the entire experience was soured when they dropped me like a bad habit when I told my coach I was pregnant. Instead of it being a positive thing and coming up with a transition plan, they locked my account, deleted all my info from THE PAST YEAR, and locked the chat function so I couldn’t even say thank you or goodbye to my coach / group. To have such a support group ripped away from me so violently caused me to rebound and I’m worse off than where I started. Loved the results.... hate the company and their approach. I get that pregnancy is a “liability” but come on.... be better. Be human.

As a nurse I knew my vision my kidneys and my circulation were at stake. Noom helped enormously and in addition helped me be a more conscious consumer. It is not a dieting app and is not focused on weight loss per se but in the psychology of eating and one’s relationship to food. It has helped me change my life completely and I suspect that when I next see the doctor I will find the changes have helped improve my blood glucose results.

I make mindful choices and move more. That’s it. I highly recommend Noom.

Seriously it’s $160 for 5 months. The “coaches you get pretty much give you canned answers for everything. And you don’t get all the coaches until the second week when your trial ends. This app does not include calories burned into its calculation of how many you should consume. There are free apps that do that for you and the food logging. The “special” thing about this app OSs uses psychology on you. The fact you have to take these mini lessons and you are given baby steps. Those are all tried and true ways to create habits. The info given is nothing special. For instance in the beginning they mention caloric density. Just google that. Bam done. You don’t need a 500$ a year so to tell you this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was optimistic about Noom after a friend said it helped her lose 10 lbs in 2 weeks, but it was a huge disappointment. For one, the “Goal Specialists” are useless. I suspect they’re just bots. I heard from mine once, days into the program, and never heard back despite my repeated messages/questions to him. There is no option for creating and saving a meal (so if you make a favorite salad each day you’ll have to manually input all the ingredients each day). I had no access to any “group” feature. No ways to adjust goals based on lactation or medications that are known to cause weight gain. If it were a free app, fine, but they charge $69/month to start, for the most basic package. No thank you. My fitness pal (free) is better.

The psychology part of noom is great. It allows you to shape the right mindset to accomplish goals. It’s the major focus on calorie density that turns me off to the program. After taking a nutrition class for nursing school and reading other books about nutrition, I feel like this reverted me back to kindergarten. There’s a lack of evidence and proof with the color coding of foods.

After my pregnancy I just couldn’t lose those last 20 pounds. Noom helped me to realize my portions had become oversized and in the wrong food groups. I love the psychology behind the food choices and how the app gets the internal struggle. I had not realized before that losing weight was not only a physical challenge, but a mental one. I’ve already lost 7 pounds and feeling great. I’m making healthy choices and feeling empowered! Thank you #NoomNerds for getting this Mom back on track.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app seems like it could have helped me to manage my weight better, but I am totally put off by their billing practices. Apparently once a charge is made, the funds are not refundable. I feel like because of the relatively steep price tag, at the very least they should let you know when they’re about to charge you to continue your subscription. I’ve sent an email but I doubt the results will be favorable. That’s unfortunate. I would have liked to perhaps continue to use the app in the future; I just didn’t have the time to really engage with the app as I have a newborn baby at home, and the program doesn’t seem to have any options geared toward nursing mothers.

I feel better and am more in control of what I eat.

I want to start eating better, so now I get to sit back and continue eating badly for another day because I can’t log any of my meals and start learning. So let’s get real Noom, it’s a 13-day free trial. And also we’re collectively postponing betterment of myself because of unnecessary gatekeeping.

I got the app because I’m a counselor and thought that the behavioral modification was an interesting avenue for weight loss. However, I am a generally fit person and only needed to lose weight because I was postpartum. The app doesn’t input things like weight lifting, instead it just counts steps. Also, the caloric intake is too low for someone working to build muscle. Not only that, but high protein foods are considered “red” as in “don’t eat these”. If someone is strong and into building muscle this app is backwards

This app is probably useful for some, but it’s a big commitment time-wise and also doesn’t have an option for caloric intake for nursing mothers. However, cancelling is not simple. You have to contact one person who connects you to another person who ignores your request and pushes you to use the app. You pay way too much to use the app to not have your request respected in an efficient manner. For that reason alone I will not come back to this app and also will not recommend.

Chatted with the people...but those people are just bots. Confirmed to me when I entered my first meal and Kieran congratulated me on eating a “green food” for breakfast. The only thing I had entered at that point was coffee with milk....that’s not very green.   Obviously this is a bot sending out canned info and I’d love to get my money back but I’m sure that won’t happen.  Buyer beware.

                      Title: Greatest Decision!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When I was younger I couldn’t gain weight to save my life. As a result I developed some not so great eating habits. When my metabolism slowed down a little I still had some bad eating habits. I was trying to prepare to be a competitive bodybuilder though so it really didn’t catch up with me until after I decided to stop lifting all of the time because I got married and we wanted a baby. My weight went from 125 to 137 which wasn’t bad at all as I’m 5’6” tall. When I got pregnant I gained exactly 30 pounds during pregnancy, a normal amount of pregnancy weight. I was told I would lose my pregnancy weight while breastfeeding. It didn’t happen. I actually went from 147 post birth to 164. I would get back down to 157 then up to 163 overnight (those bad eating habits from when I was too thin). I considered Noom a couple times in 2020 but didn’t want to spend the money because I was making less money. After I discovered my husband’s sister had already lost several pounds on Noom even while traveling back and forth when her husband was ill I reconsidered Noom. But this time I did more than reconsider. I decided to just dive in! I didn’t realize anything needed to change because I already at a good amount of organic fruits and vegetables. The problem is I was eating in the wrong proportions. I was choosing too little lean protein and too high of fat. I was eating way too much cheese. I started losing weight right away. When my husband heard his sister and I talking about it so frequently and seeing our results he decided to give it a try. Though the scale is 10 pounds less, my waist is 5 inches smaller, and even my arms (big because I used to lift a lot of heavy weights) are smaller my biggest, most noticeable, and most loved result is the increase in energy! My big picture has everything to do with having more energy, being able to be more active with my nearly 3 year old daughter, and not developing diabetes, hypertension and a slew of other health issues older family members have inherited through a combination of genetics and bad habits. Thanks to Noom I am well on my way to having enough energy and good health to be here late into life for my daughter and I couldn’t be happier!

                      Title: The coaching and daily articles really help!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

About 8 years ago I was 200lbs and ended up losing 75lbs just by increasing my activity. I was in college walking around campus everywhere, had a decent social life, and I walked about 3 miles a day. It felt super easy. Fast forward several years, I’m at a cushy desk job and back up to 200, sometimes fluctuating between 200 and 210. Increasing my activity just hasn’t been a feasible option- I work 50 hrs a week, I have a new baby, and just finished treatments for cancer so I’m dealing with mental and emotional hang ups in addition to a lack of spare time. But the more time that passes at 200lbs the more I yearn for my old, slender, vibrant self. So I decided to finally make a commitment to losing weight again. Noom helped me realize I don’t have to quit anything I love and I don’t have to spend time I don’t have. I can work within the constraints of my daily life and succeed! So I made the necessary modifications and have already lost 6lbs! I’ve only been at it for a few weeks! I still drink, but I drink spiked seltzer water. I still snack, but I eat pickles or fruit or carrots, I still have salad dressing, but I use yogurt-based dressing, I still eat meat and bacon but I measure appropriate amounts! And I record EVERYTHING that goes into my mouth. Sometimes I record something BEFORE I eat it to give myself a chance to decide if it’s worth the calories. Sometimes if something looks like it’ll eat up too much of my budget, I will just eat half and give the rest away. I feel like I have so much more control than I used to. And my coach helps me stay on track by texting me if she notices I haven’t logged in a while (like when I went on vacation). I don’t use the group support as much, but that’s because I’m more intrinsically motivated (Noom terms ftw!) and don’t need as much support from others. But I definitely need some pats on the back every now and then, and this app provides that. I highly suggest it!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I gained 10 lbs in two months after having minor elective foot surgery.  I have another month before walking restrictions are lifted.  I had to do something and thought I’d check Noom out.  I had never weighed daily or logged food and wasn’t happy about it.  I did it anyway.  The positive reinforcement and focus on nutrition with excellent guidelines keep me focused on my goal.  My goal is not to lose weight.  My goal is to climb a mountain that’s in my backyard.  It’s only a four mile hike but I see that mountain almost everyday and I thought it was impossible.  I’ve lost nine lbs in one month, 40 to go.  I am 65 and have arthritis in my knee that can be problematic so not positive I can climb the last 50 feet to the peak.  But I am confidant I can make it up there if I do a little uphill walking training and take it slow. I have eaten pretty much everything.  I am enjoying delicious food, sandwiches on Dave’s Killer bread, whole wheat pita with meat and veggie shish kabobs, homemade beef barley soup, I’ve had chocolates and cookies and gelato in moderation.  I switched to 1% milk in my lattes, I enjoyed a delicious burger 7% lean on whole wheat bun.  Skipped cheese and mayo and fries.  It’s not just salads, it’s mindful eating with a focus on why we choose food based on habits and environment.  Can’t say enough about how it’s helping me.  And yeah, I’m willing to pay a buck a day to get healthy and feel good about myself!  Less than the cost of one soda or candy bar.

                      Title: Noom
--------------------------------------------------------------------

So far I’m halfway through the program I purchased for weight loss, and I have lost 1.5lbs in 8 weeks. The app predicted me to lose all 14lbs I wanted to in 16 weeks which at this point is impossible even though I’ve been pretty compliant with the program...so probably not something I’d recommend to another person based off my results so far. I’m not sure how it expects that to happen when for 2 months I have only gone up and down 1.5lbs (in the past I’ve had a lot more luck with weight watchers). The app it’s self has some glitches as well, tracking your meals can be kind of tedious when they involve lots of ingredients (salad, a wrap, etc.) because you have to enter them individually and it takes a long time but there have been times I’ve entered an entire meal I go out of the app only to go back in later and NONE of it saved so I have to re-enter!! So annoying. Also, the calories of some of the foods loaded into the app are incorrect so you really have to pay attention to labels and double check that is has the right amount of calories listed on the label or else you could be over or under calculating, I noticed this later so for a few weeks I was eating more calories than I thought because the app was saying certain foods were lower calories than the label. I wish there was a capability on the app to enter you next days meals the day before also...it coaches a lot on planning ahead yet you aren’t allowed to enter you meals for the next day. I’m a nurse, I pack my lunch everyday and eat breakfast before I go to work, both which I make the night before so it would have been nice to have tracked them the night before and then would have more time to plan my dinner or for any slip ups I may encounter during the day at work. It is nice that the app has a build in support group through the coaches and group chats...that is a nice feature.

                      Title: Needs Improvement for Price
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I joined noom because I wanted a different take on dieting. They do provide a psychological outlook and teach you how to change your eating habits. They do not provide nutrients information in foods or provide recipes that are based on what you eat. There are certain things I would not change because I don’t like them (EX: white rice for brown or quinoa, or whole milk for low fat or fat free milk). Changing for long term was my goal, and changing to foods I don’t like would be temporary. Logging food can be clunky and the wrong calories due to others input or many entries for one product, making a recipe whether from scratch or with some canned goods are difficult because the scanner does not work with it, also if you need to change the recipe you can’t edit it or delete it. The cost was all up front and is figured based on how much weight you want to lose and how fast you want to lose it ( mine was 4 months and cost $129 and then they want to charge an additional fee for workout routine and food menus at a cost of about $59 each). The basic program is about $1 per day which is high, but it is the money up front that was difficult - there is a 14 day free trial with credit card information that I found helpful to learn about the program and so I stayed. Now that I am coming to an end of my time I am trying to find a different app because I don’t want to pay to continue.

                      Title: Only 1 good thing about this app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been using this app for 6 weeks. Pros: I like the way they break down your calorie allotment into colored categories so regardless of you calorie budget you know which foods to go easy on and how many calories to dedicate to each category. That’s basically the only pro. Cons: The cost of it varies depending on who you ask. Friends of mine got a much cheaper deal than I did. They tout their coach and group features as well as their nutrition education feature but the group has been useless to me and the coach has a very long response time. I will email her and then an entire day later I get a vague response. The nutritional info they teach you is valuable but you can find the same information for free online. I literally haven’t learned one single thing from these articles. Also, their food logging database is often incorrect. I’ll scan or look up a food to log and the calories they have in their database are frequently incorrect. There’s an option to add new food items but for some reason, after entering the new food item, they don’t put that food item into your daily food journal.  Also, I’m gluten free and all of my gluten free grain items are in the red category which leaves me the option of eating my GF items or going completely grain free and saving those calories for things like olive oil or nuts. It’s not very friendly for GF people. I often scan items thinking they’ll be yellow or green (low fat chicken sausage, coconut milk yogurt, plain rice cakes) and they’re in the red category which makes no sense to me if you look at their definition for what’s in each category.  Also, this is a WEIGHT LOSS app but their articles and coaches try to encourage you to measure your progress in ways besides weight. When I signed up for this, they said I’d lose 15 pounds by the end of July and I’ve followed everything to the letter and have only lost 3-5 pounds in the last 6 weeks. They keep moving my goal weight date out further and further. My Noom coach told me to try cutting out dairy since GF people often need to be dairy free as well. So I cut out dairy and GAINED weight. I eat very healthily, exercise 3-5 times a week and I’m a generally fit and active person but as I’ve gotten older my weight has creeped up a bit until I have had about 10-15 pounds to lose. This app helped me lose a couple of pounds but is a very flawed program that is only probably going to work for 20-somethings with very typical body types and no health issues. I cut out grains, dairy and almost all sugar and have seen very little changes in my weight or body.

The best thing about Noom is that it teaches you there is no such thing as a bad food and there is no food you can’t have.  You can eat anything you want as long as it fits into your calorie budget....you learn budgeting and nutrition!  If you follow the program- read your articles, log your food, even if you don’t exercise, you will lose weight.  As a nurse, this is a very sustainable program because of the habits it helps you build.  Working as am ER nurse I’d developed terrible food habits that I knew would result in weight gain (and disease processes) as I get older.

                      Title: Customer support poor communication
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I decided to try Noom for a bit and was willing to pay for a few months to try the full subscription. For reasons I will never understand and which have never been fully explained to me, within a week my Goal Specialist or the system or someone on their end cancelled my subscription. I had to contact customer support 3 times to get anyone to answer me. When they finally did, they apologized for the error and even gave me a link for a 20% discount. I tried to sign back up with the discount and it never worked. I contacted customer support again and no one ever responded so I signed up thru iTunes which was 3x the price!! I contacted customer support again to try to get it straightened out. No one ever got back to me. In the meantime my Goal Specialist found out I was pregnant. I had been honest that I was pregnant and not looking to lose weight, just motivation to eat healthy throughout my pregnancy. He informed me that because Noom is specifically for weight loss (it really isn’t. Their tips and advice are all around healthy eating but their calorie suggestions are very very low hence the weight loss. I was just eating more calories than they recommended each day) they would not allow me to continue and they cancelled me again! I asked if I could just continue but not log my calories or eat above the recommendation and no one ever answered me.

                      Title: Just bad
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I gave in and decided to try out Noom. Didn’t get past a couple of days on the trial. I’ll give you my experience and let you decide for yourself. I gave my weight goal at the beginning of the questionnaire (before purchasing a trial subscription) which is a substantial number, and I was told by Noom that it could get me to my goal weight by December this year if “I believed it.” December, I thought, would be incredible and insane. This is also after I told Noom that I wanted my weight loss to be gradual and long term, not a quick one. Then, I actually paid and enrolled in the trial, and Noom told me that it could help me get to my goal weight by AUGUST now. If “I believed.” 55 pounds by August, starting in mid April. Do the math. That’s extremely unhealthy, especially for someone like me who has a disordered eating past. THEN when I check my weight progress after I weighed-in, it tells me that my goal weight - which I did not input - is 12 pounds LESS and will get there by late August. Noom will have me lose nearly 70 pounds in just three months without surgery and I’m assuming by just drinking water and starving myself. This goes hand-in-hand about “scale anxiety.” Noom will pretend to be empathetic in its little articles you are required to read, and say that while scales aren’t always the best way to determine weight loss and health, and while weight fluctuates from day to day and even throughout the day (which is all true!), that users still need to weigh in every single day and follow that number for “progress.” This could be bad for people with eating disorders or recovering from eating disorders/disordered eating. While Noom thinks it’s telling you a lot, it’s also not. It tells you to drink more/enough water for you and that the amount to drink is different for everyone, but that drinking the right amount is important. And then tells you to give yourself a water goal. Do you know how much water you should be drinking? I don’t. I thought Noom would be helpful, but they’re not. The same thing with its food guidelines. Noom markets on “still being able to eat a cookie” and not being restrictive. And then will tell you not to eat relatively healthy food like avocado or almond milk. Don’t even have a skinny latte, a “treat” because that’s also not recommended even though the ads say you’re “allowed.”  You can’t have a color scheme like green, yellow and red and say “it doesn’t mean these are necessarily bad foods” even though everyone knows what those colors represent in general. Another thing is that Noom will keep pushing you to purchase add-ons or skip the trial session and go straight to purchasing a 7-month subscription for nearly $200 without you having an opportunity to find out if you actually like the program. It did this 3 times in a row after I said no. Stupid and disappointing. I should know better than to fall for trendy diet fads but I thought Noom would be better. It’s not. Go see an actual licensed nutritionist.

                      Title: Horrible, buggy app with customer service to match
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I really wanted to like Noom.  I believe in the philosophy they share.  But my experience has been too disappointing.  First, the app is incredibly limiting and frequently buggy.  The software development team must be second or third rate because the designs aren’t responsive, meaning text is frequently cut off with no way to expand or view.  The database of nutritional information is 99% incorrect - every time I compare to an actual nutritional label of my food, the calorie count is always different for the same serving size.  Even within Noom, depending on what screen you add from, 1 cup could be 48 calories or 1 cup could be 110 calories.  It makes no sense.  The color coding also makes no sense.  Trader Joe’s organic soy milk which is 80 calories a cup is a green food.  Kirkland’s organic soy milk which has the exact same ingredients, and the exact same calorie count, is a yellow food.  Why???  The lessons encourage you to add nuts to your diet as a “healthy snack.”  Nuts are also labeled as a red food and you should either avoid or eat as little as possible.  It’s like nobody in this organization talks to each other.   The “coach” you get is either a bot, or incredibly robotic and unresponsive.  Mine waits 3-4 days before responding to me, and clearly has some script or is just cutting and pasting without actually listening.  A single customer service ticket I filed to ask about billing has been passed around 3 different customer service representative, none of whom have answered my question, the latest one directly contradicts what the first one said.  I’ll be canceling because while I wanted to love Noom, my experience would make me rather light my money on fire.

                      Title: Nicely packaged eating disorder
--------------------------------------------------------------------

It promotes itself as a “lifestyle change, not a diet.” Guess what, if it has you counting calories and avoiding certain foods, it’s a diet. They say the green-yellow-red categories are not to make red foods “bad” but they still have the effect of making you afraid to eat “red” foods that are perfectly healthy and satisfying, like a cheese stick or whole milk. When you go over your meager allotment it gives you a dramatic red triangle with an exclamation point in the middle to make sure you know you failed, even if you stayed within your day’s “calorie budget” and weren’t hungry because you ate mostly a combo of green and red foods and were light on the yellow. Counting every calorie, daily weighing and ignoring true hunger cues because you’re “out of calories” are food-obsessive behaviors and are not healthy especially for those who have struggled with eating disorders, according to REAL #psychology. Those are exactly the things that cause people to eventually fall out of a diet cycle and back into a binge. The “coaching” is canned. It takes sooo long for them to get back to you with a non-answer. The way the quizzes and supplemental info are given is immature and condescending. I’m switching to Intuitive Eating, which is truly NOT a diet, it’s eating disorder recovery. But I guess thanks Noom for triggering all the bad behaviors I had back when I had bulimia and making it clear to me that I still have an eating disorder, just a different one than I used to, and that it needs treatment rather than another diet. DIETS DON’T WORK and this one is just repackaged Volumetrics in a sleek app. I especially would not recommend it for those with an eating disorder but really can’t recommend it for anyone who wants a psychologically healthy relationship with food.

I decided to try noom after a few friends recommended it. I had gained some weight through two pregnancies and wanted to knock it down. I was hoping to find strategies that would make increasing exercise with 10 month old twins and a 4 year old more functional, and wanted some guidance on adjusting my diet, which was already very healthy.

                      Title: I love noom
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love noom and I would give it 5 stars but it's missing things it used to have like showing you at the end of the day a color food graph to show your percentage of green food, yellow food, and red food. I liked that because it always motivated me to eat more green food. However you still can track your food colors and your exercise and it gives you health tips along with tracking your weight. I've been using it for years after three babies and I went from 105 to 175 back down to 102 at one point and now after my third baby I'm using it again and am at 120 hoping to get back down to 105 which is not unhealthy since I'm only 5ft. Anyways great app!

                      Title: Very encouraging and realistic
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was hesitant signing up for the trial, because I really felt like I just had no time to make any lifestyle changes right now even though I really wanted to. But right away my coach and team were so supportive. It does a great job coaching you along to make small, meaningful, realistic goals to make true lifestyle changes- not rushing and trying to do too much and crashing and burning. I've lost 12 pounds in the last 11 weeks, and I still have my ups and downs but I feel like my mind set in approaching things is so much healthier. I actually have training in motivational interviewing and psychology of behavior changes as a nurse, and I can see them applying so many of these concepts in the app. The readings are always short enough I can do them while getting ready in the morning. Some weeks I don't do what the app specifically wants me too- but it pushes me to be making intentional, mindful choices. And the support from my group mates is invaluable- it's always so encouraging to have them problem solve with me, and I feel inspired and motivated when trying to encourage them, too. They make me feel like I CAN do this, and also keep me from falling into bad  thought spirals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

At 56 years old I found myself heavier than I had ever been in my entire life even while pregnant. After hitting bottom emotionally I reached out to Noom. I signed up and then let it sit for six months with no activity. July 1, 2020 began the journey of changing my life forever. I started Noom seriously and followed logging food faithfully. Logging food before i ate or even ordered my food helped me find what I could eat. Using the food log to buy groceries helped me to stay on track with what was in my home to eat. This was not a fast weight loss program, this is a life-changing program. One year later I have lost 72 pounds and I’m 6 pounds off my goal weight.My body has been transformed, at 57 years old I run 2 miles three times a week and my marriage has been completely changed. I feel amazing in my skin!! Thank you Noom for my life transformation.

                      Title: Not working
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Coming off a Keto diet, I felt confident this approach would lower my ballooning cholesterol level and vastly reduce the number of calories I’d be ingesting. The end result? Losing weight. Well, that’s just not true for me. I am taking in ~1200-1400 calories per day and after a month...nothing. Not an ounce. With keto, I’m sure I was eating 2-3x the calories. So to be “cheating” on Noom would mean that I’m sneaking whole burgers or milkshakes (which I’m not). The math just doesn’t add up in my particular case.
