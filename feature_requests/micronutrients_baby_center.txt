                      Title: one of the best baby-parent apps out there
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I got so encouraged with what I had grasped through this app with my first ever parenting experience that I’m now planning to develop something similar for Azerbaijani mothers (that’s where I’m from) in a native language so first time moms and pregnant women know how to take care of themselves both for the sake of their own and their to-be-born babies’ health. sometimes hearing the stories of women who didn’t know they needed to be putting more effort to calcium or high in fiber food intake and are now struggling either with bone weakness or hemorrhoids - is making me appreciate what people at baby center  (and text for baby organization which sends couple of text messages with important info throughout pregnancy) do! thank you all so very much for helping all of us stay knowledgeable, healthy and happy and contribute to giving birth to and raising a successful baby with sound health!

                      Title: Moms attacking other moms
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I really liked the app until recently. I think all of the baby information is great, and if you only use it for that I guess it’s pretty solid. I’ve recently gotten into the “birth club community” where other moms post their questions/comments or are just looking for a safe space to vent. I’ve noticed a lot of people putting others down/spreading judgment. I wish they had a way to clean up this sort of thing. There’s very specific women on here who’s names seem to pop up on EVERYTHING that seem to always be looking for a chance to knock others down, and it quickly becomes moms ganging up on other moms. Maybe that’s just the internet and I should get off, but I don’t think it needs to be this kind of environment. I specifically deleted social media for this reason and wasn’t aware that a baby app could possibly come with the same amount of drama.

                      Title: Amazing App
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When trying to get pregnant for two years, I used many apps, but this one was the most accurate on the dates.  It was also a great resource to refer back to with the million appointments asking when the last missed period and other dates were.  It was also great to refer back to, to see what the symptoms should be during each week. It has so much information and other mothers to help to solve the worries that may come up. Now my baby is 3 months, and it tells me the baby milestones now.  It is so nice to read what I can expect! I definitely would recommend this app to anyone that would just like the extra info and sources to help when trying to conceive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Baby center helps me get through the long periods of pregnancy when I just can’t wait to meet my baby and feel like it’s taking forever! The updates remind me to pause and reflect upon each little milestone. They also give accurate developmental information at all stages of life (as far as I have seen). As a person with a master’s degree in early childhood education, it is exciting to see relevant and important milestone information shared through this app for parents who may not already know the significance of each step or how to help facilitate their child’s healthy development.

I love the bumpie photo gallery where I can keep track of my growing belly each week. Every week your baby is compared to the size of a vegetable or a fruit in the bumpie gallery. This app is fun and also has great articles to read that correlate to your specific week. Articles range from prenatal vitamins, what foods to eat each week, work outs & much more!  I definitely used this app more than the typical “expected” app. GREAT JOB!

I have signed both my children up so that I periodically get updates.  Then chose whether or not I want to read.  No pressure reading at my leisure.

All in all this app is very informative and I'd highly recommend to any expecting mother!

Also the due date is counted inaccurate. I know the exact date of embryo impantation and it doesn’t match due date they suggest according to my last period🤔.

                      Title: Heteronormative
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was excited to begin tracking my pregnancy but from my first encounter with this app I have been struck by how heteronormative it is. I started by completing the "Am I pregnant?" quiz and the first question was "have you had sex since your last period?". As a married lesbian using home insemination with a known donor I did not become pregnant by having sex. In fact, many straight women become pregnant through alternative methods these days. It's time to get with the times and update the app to reflect the diversity of pregnancy in 2018.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a great app but I do think you should be able to use the app after your baby turns 1 years old. I’m saying that because I had a micro preemie and those who have preemies must go by age adjusted and not their actual age. This is due to developmental delays due to being born prematurely. This will be great for those who have preemies or micro preemies.

Worse than some Facebook mom groups. And the “group owners” are the worst ones. Plus you can’t turn off notifications for a post, you can’t delete posts, and you can’t block or ignore group owners. So if there’s a post you’ve made that’s filling up with bullies in the comments, there’s no way to stop seeing it or to delete it. The overall app is fine I guess aside from some glitches with Bumpie, but it is NOT a supportive environment, especially for first time moms.

I enjoy the app. I also enjoy the idea of a community pregnancy board, but there is too much bullying and needless attacking that is left unchecked to consider it the safe place it is intended to be. It’s cool if you don’t mind that culture, but now that I know that the reality doesn’t match the advertising, I won’t be using this app or the community. I don’t like that this is advertised as a “safe and kind” environment when the unkindness is allowed to persist.

Seriously. They do not harbor a positive environment whatsoever.

                      Title: Pregnancy Brain Password Nightmare
--------------------------------------------------------------------

While the information in this app is detailed and helpful, the app logs me out monthly. Of course I can’t remember my password or the email address I used...hello pregnancy brain. Ironic how an app I like to use during pregnancy seems to play on my greatest pregnancy weakness.
