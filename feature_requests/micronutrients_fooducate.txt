                      Title: Issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Many of the foods I eat are not in the database. Many of the foods that are in the database have the wrong nutrition information also. This has messed up my information, but now that I realize I double check the nutrition label and enter the nutrition information myself. When entering the information Vitamins A and C cannot be included in the nutrition information because there is no place for them. It would be helpful to include vitamins and minerals in the nutrition information. Apple HealthKit does not update when you delete something it remains in there. It would be nice to be able to see the carb count and other nutrition information per meal instead of and/or in addition to the total amount per day. A new day begins at 12:00 EST and ends at 11:59 p.m. EST, but the app does not adhere to this as it remains on the day before calling it today when it is well into the next day. The ability to print a report from ‚ÄúAll Time‚Äù, 90 days, 1 month, 14 days, and 7 days would be helpful. For privacy the app should allow for a passcode on the iPhone app.

                      Title: Food tracking needs more detail
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The scanning via camera of foods is awesome, but this needs more details when it comes to food logging. For example, one can only log on a mobile device. The option to log on a desktop would make this process faster. Also, different serving units should be included. For example, one should be able to enter food as units of weight and volume, with both imperial and metric measurements. The amount of food consumed shouldn‚Äôt be required to be relative to service size. For example, I had 1/3 of a cup of oatmeal, but I was forced to say how many multiples of 1/4 cup that was. That‚Äôs a pain if you care about precision. Finally, the nutrition reports should also include vitamin and mineral reports. This could be particularly useful for vegetarians and others who need to be more vigilant about iron and other nutrients.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I just tried the app, only to discover that even for the price, I don‚Äôt get to track very many nutrients at all. Since I‚Äôm trying a vegan diet, nutrient tracking is more important than ever. I thought I‚Äôd be able to track more once I paid. They call it a trial period, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be free.  Am I wrong? Is it free? Either way, the eventual price isn‚Äôt worth not being able to track more nutrients. On a couple of other apps I‚Äôve tried you can track far more nutrients. The problem is just that their calorie accuracy is not reliable at all. However, I think I‚Äôm gonna go back to one of them because it‚Äôs so much easier to use than My Fitness Pal and you can track more nutrients.

I am pre diabetic and trying to keep my BP under control. But recently the Fooducate app has been failing to launch . I tap the app , it comes up ready to scan , and immediately closes the app . So I deleted it . I want to add it back but forgot how to do it . Lol I‚Äôm not too tech savvy, any help will be appreciated.

I got no response. I‚Äôve scoured the app and it simply doesn‚Äôt track very many nutrients. I sent another message a week later and still have gotten no response.

                      Title: Wonderful tool that works
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Just recently put it to use since January 2017! Very happy with the outcome, it was exactly what I needed to lose 10-11 pounds to get to my ideal weight. I noticed i would go up about pound each week since I am in between moving and staying at hotels, eating out etc. I said nooo I have to do something.  Firstly, I love food and look forward to eating, I was doubtful because I've never been a calorie counter and wasn't working out regularly.  After actually logging in all my meals, snacks, any physical activity, even walking, taking stairs (anything and  everything counts) I got to see that I was actually eating too much of certain things although satisfied with less.  Once I was aware of that it was actually easy to stay under the limit and not feel deprived.  It was the easiest thing I've done towards actively losing weight. I became aware of what calories certain things have and how clean the food is.  It's all in the database, you can also scan the item and select the portion.  They just made it so easy, like a food diary but easier, little effort. Give it a try, it works! I would say I lost the 10 lbs over a 2 month period.

The tips and reports they have have taught me a few things I was unaware of, and not to bost, but I am more knowledgable on health, nutrients and preventative medicine than most. The help this App gives, gives you the real time info that aides you to stay on track with your goals and needs. So you naturally being more informed make better choices. I can say it motivates you to make better choices and create healthy habits that fulfill the foodie in you as well as the inner athlete and healthy content spirit.

Finally something that can help me truly breakdown what I am eating throughout the day. I was on WW counting points diligently and exercising 4-5 x a week. My weight was coming off but ridiculously slow. It wasn't making sense. Plus I was crabby and always hungry !!! How could I be eating in my point range , exercising and not losing weight?!!! Grrrr! Enter Foodeducate. A coworker told us about it and I was intrigued. So started using it AND checking my points with  WW. Guess what? Sure I was eating enough points but what WW wasn't telling me was , I was eating way too much sodium, too many carbs, not enough protein. Since adjusting these things it is bloody amazing how different I feel. Energized, full, not craving my love, cookies. And guess what? Losing weight!!!! If you want to really to get healthy cause that is the key , not just counting calories or points but this app helps you get healthy!!!

I've seriously learned so much from this app. It is SO educational. This sets it apart from other health trackers and food logging apps. It doesn't just focus on calories when determining when a food is good or bad or just okay for you- it will point out and explain controversial chemical ingredients, ridiculous sodium levels, ect. If you don't like reading into all of the nitty gritty things it says you can just focus on the clear grades it gives the foods you scan. You can use this app to find out what kind of cereal/ketchup/bread/anything is the best and worst for you from the grading system. Truly a great tool. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to learn what they are REALLY putting in their mouths or how to live with a healthier lifestyle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Thus far, Fooducate has worked well and really impacted my eating and shopping decisions. I have encountered two problems, however. The first is that the ratings don't seem to take sodium into account very often. This isn't necessarily a big problem if you're already reading nutrition labels, but I think it causes some salty foods to get a better grade than try deserve because they feature whole grains, etc. The other issue is duplicate items with different grades. I'm not sure how the app decides on grades and criteria, but I've encountered a couple of instances where say, the family pack of an item has a better grade than the standard size. It just needs some clean up.  Other than that, this is an extremely worthwhile app.

I've been comparing several of these apps and now it's down to this one and Lose It!  If fooducate had the following 3 features my decision would be simple because its food database has more of the foods i scan from costco and recipes and i like being able to take a photo of the food and use that in place of an icon.  what fooducate doesn't have is a way to separate breakfast, lunch, & dinner items that have been logged and it's interface is not nearly as pleasingly designed as Lose It! Hybrid vigor, that's what's needed.  Also I haven't figured out how to get a log of the total vitamins in the foods I've consumed, even though those numbers are in the nutritional information for the foods I ate.

This app is very easy to use. Has a huge food database. Allows for GMO tracking and offers alternatives when you want to make better choices. I like the synapsis it gives you when you read about the foods. I wish it had more detailed food tracking (proteins, sodium, cholesterol etc) and would be nice if you could set your own specific goals to said details. But, over all this app is excellent and like I said, quick and easy food logging (if it takes too much time I usually will not track it all because I need something that can keep up with my lifestyle)

I like this app only for the insights on food, the grades. I prefer something more interactive where I can put in the exact amount of food I ate, for instance 1.25 because that happens more often than not. I also do not like their stance on supplements. Fooducate will not analyze supplements because it believes you should only get your nutrients from food. Well of course! But Some of us have legitimate reasons for needing vitamins or supplements.

A good overall app! What I like most about it is that you can add in your exercise and it will calculate it all for you. There are a ton of products to choose from and the ability to scan bar codes makes this app super easy to use. It also helps to keep track of things like sodium, fiber, etc for the day. At the end of the day it breaks down everything you've inputted and give you easy to understand stats. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to watch what they are eating.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

As a physician, I think this app is really nice in terms of simplifying what are good food choices for my patients.  I understand fooducate is trying to roll out versions or updates that include special diets.  I think it would be really helpful to be able to specify all the dietary needs of an individual. For example, low sodium and carb control. But all that said I think this app is wonderful... If only more of my patients were tech savvy!

This app confirms the old adage that knowledge is power. It allows you to have a much better sense of what you‚Äôre eating, how much of it you‚Äôre eating - and if you should be eating it at all. And it makes it kind of fun too. The Pro features are definitely worth it, as it allows you to track protein, fat, sodium, etc, as well as weight and other medical info. Support person was helpful and super nice too

This app is great to get people to start eating better. Yes foods with additives aren't on my top ten favorites but in reality as long as you're getting ample vitamins, minerals, low fat, low calorie, whole grains, etc. That's what should be top priority and this app does it. Plus for ppl wanting to know about GMO I have news for you non GMO is not guaranteed in anything in america anymore at all since insects go from crop farm with GMO crops and pollinate non GMO crops.

I like this app. It helps to quickly scan for numbers (sodium content) and ingredients I might miss.  However it feels like there are two sets of info by different authors. I've found multiple products with grades of A- or B -- pretty good of any scale -- but that when you read the description of the ingredients a clear recommendation is made to 'put it back'. If that rec is there, shouldn't the grade be lower?

The ability to add a product that the app doesn't have would also be a plus. Its the best one i have found although I haven't done much looking.

There should be a section of easy recipes that show the nutritional value. For instance a guacamole recipe. Maybe have a section that recommends more vitamin A or something the diet seems to be lacking.

I am currently on Under Armor‚Äôs  My Fitness, getting 50% of the information from them for free. I can‚Äôt be roped into more fitness stuff that has to do with paying out 40 bucks a year. UA offers other premiums, as well as every other AP under, but at this rate I‚Äôll be spending $200 a year just find best hikes, caloric intake/BURN, vitamins and minerals shy of daily goals, bike trails, heart rates, farts/hour and everything else. But you Health applications that came with the phone monitors my movements, mindfulness and many other things, several free apps monitor other things and some even give ME $$$ for every step or exercise.

                      Title: LOVING THIS APP AND NOW WITH THE NEW UPDATE SCANNING IS BETTER AND IPOD SUPPORTED!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fooducate inspires ‚Äúwow that is cool‚Äù to me, scanning bar tags near instantly is pretty sweet, then pulling up a good amount of data on the product, even cooler. Eating well from pre-packaged food is a near impossibility anymore. Every single item in the store has a catch. Hidden sodium content, extra carbs, lack of protein, you name it. Fooducate helps with the decision whether to pick something up or put it down for good, an in-store, hand-held guilt trip. Point your iPhone or iPod with camera at a bar code and wait the 3 seconds for it to give you a grade on the healthiness of any product at your grocery store. It is super simple and quick as hell finding the info on your item. It includes a large amount of information on each product also, not just providing the grade, it tells you why it gives that grade, what the problem with the product is (30% of your daily salt in 1 serving, 1/2, of 1 can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli), alternative products to what you‚Äôve scanned that are better options,  and details about the red flags affecting the grade. It is pretty depressing to know your lunch is 60% of your entire daily allotment of salt, knowing you‚Äôre killing yourself with ravioli is pretty damned depressing.
