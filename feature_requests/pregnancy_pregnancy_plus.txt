                      Title: I paid for the premium but it‚Äôs saying I didn‚Äôt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

So I originally got this app with my 1st pregnancy, but I didn‚Äôt pay for the premium because at the time I thought it was bonkers to pay $4.99 for a pregnancy app when all the other pregnancy apps are free. I decided to purchase the app with my current pregnancy back when so found out I was pregnant in August 2020. I KNOW I paid for the app because I would not have been able to use a majority of the features however.... when I decided that I wanted to make a birth plan and use the app to do it, it says I have to purchase the premium for $1.99 which I couldn‚Äôt understand because I paid $4.99 for premium. Every once in a while I‚Äôll have apps that do this so I‚Äôll just tap ‚Äúrestore‚Äù and it restores my purchase and everything is fine. NOT WITH THIS APP. I tapped ‚Äúrestore‚Äù and a message pops up that says ‚ÄúAlert: You have not purchased the app.‚Äù YES I HAVE PURCHASED THE APP. This leads me to think that even though you have to pay $4.99 for the premium, there is also an additional $1.99 charge for the premium that they have snuck in making this app actually $6.98. Phillips what are you doing????

                      Title: Great Images, Actual Information Less Helpful
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The images it provides of you and the baby are fantastic. The overall interface is also very well done- easy to navigate, love that it updates daily. I‚Äôm only giving three stars because the actual info provided is often not very helpful (I don‚Äôt think most people need a full article to tell them pregnancy during sex is safe these days) or a bit off the right timeline (I‚Äôm not quite 14wks and it told me today the baby can now hear me, which is just wrong). The sizes are a bit off because it always shows where you will be at the end of the week, but doesn‚Äôt tell you that‚Äî at 13 weeks, 0 days it will say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre now...‚Äù and give you info that any other source shows for 14 weeks, including your doctor. I overlooked a lot of the faults for the things I do like and kept using, but just found out I‚Äôll get charged to continue in about 2 days, which isn‚Äôt worth the money to me for information that may have small inaccuracies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my favorite pregnancy app and I‚Äôve used it for all three of my pregnancies! The articles about how my baby is growing and what‚Äôs happening to my body that specific week is my favorite part and has been very accurate for me personally. When I was 9 weeks pregnant with my third, I started feeling really hormonal and nauseous‚Ä¶I opened up the app and it literally said that this week I might feel more nauseous and hormonal than before! It then went on to share different ways I could help nauseous etc. This type of thing has happened multiple times on this app and I love that! I feel like it knows me haha. It‚Äôs filled with the kind of information I want during pregnancy. It‚Äôs also easy to use. I‚Äôve recommended this app to all my pregnant friendsü•∞

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôm 29 weeks pregnant with twins and have used several apps to track my pregnancy. Out of all the ones i use this is by far my favorite and best one. I love all the features. However at 29 weeks pregnant i can honestly say some of the daily articles are recycled. You read similar articles about things that was already touched earlier in your pregnancy with the app. How many times are you going to tell me about morning sickness, backpains etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Title: Poor articles; great images
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The interactive images are beautifully rendered. But like other reviews have noted, the articles are bland, out of date with current medical advice and uninformative. For example, it says to be limit fish to 1-2 times a week and only 1 oily fish, while most OBs are increasingly emphasizing the importance of the omegas in oily fish. Other articles are the typical round up of vapid takes on the usual topics of what to eat and buying clothes and talking to your doctor if you feel down. These could be much more interesting! Also, in an article about possible Down syndrome testing in early pregnancy, they say only that ‚Äúsome women prefer to find out during their pregnancy so they can learn more about the condition and what special care is required.‚Äù It undermines the pain and extreme difficultly women wrestle with as they decide whether to keep a pregnancy with confirmed chromosomal problems. Pretending that doesn‚Äôt exist at all is really weird whitewashing. It‚Äôs not a political issue.

                      Title: Great app for pregnancy
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Wonderful app for pregnancy and for a few bucks you can use it after the 1st trimester which is totally worth it. They do mention that it DOES cost money to continue after 1st trimester but they do NOT flood you with advertisements so it doesn‚Äôt interrupt ur experience at all. Like some other apps flood you with requests to upgrade. Not so here. Which is a giant plus. This app Has a kick counter included. I love how it reminds me every week when I turn to the next week, also gives helpful articles on what to except etc. the images are in range from 2D to 4D to computer generated animations which are beautiful. Also shows timeline of tests that are done at ur OBGYN s. Included appointment tracker and reminder, so u can easily store the info for scrapbook later. Other features as well.

                      Title: *Nearly* perfect - can‚Äôt adjust cycle length
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is absolutely incredible. It‚Äôs really everything you could need and want in a pregnancy app. Lots of information, planning capabilities, and my most favorite feature - the weekly growth aspect that offers true to size fetal development. My ONLY gripe is that you cannot adjust your menstrual cycle length, so if your periods aren‚Äôt exactly 28 days, the only way to track your pregnancy is through a due date. That‚Äôs certainly not a deal breaker, but when I look at my calendar I would like to be able to see my LMP. I have PCOS and ovulate close to 3 weeks into my cycle, so I would just like to be able to customize my calendar to reflect that.

                      Title: Please consider these?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app I used it with my first pregnancy. However I feel there should be the option to eliminate the partner info. As well as articles involving partners. Not everyone is blessed enough to have someone by their side. Some people lose their partner and some never have one. I find it a bit depressing, scrolling and having to see the partner stuff every time, being one who no longer has someone to share this with. I think this should be recognized. Also this is my second child and I find most articles are geared more toward first time mothers. It would be nice to choose an option of whether you are a new mom or have had children. That way content could be better filtered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I used this app for my first pregnancy in 2017 and recommended it to EVERYONE!! Even paid for the update because this app was perfect! Definitely would have given 5 stars... before the update! The #1 reason I loved this app so much was for the images and easy navigation. I downloaded again now and all those beautiful baby images are gone and they have the alien looking graphics like any other app!üò≠ sure it‚Äôs cool because it wiggles when you touch it but definitely not as good as before! Don‚Äôt fix what isn‚Äôt broken! I find this update much much much harder to navigate than before. If they could bring back the lively images instead of the aliens I‚Äôll be one happy camper! However I do enjoy that that‚Äôs still provide a 2d and 3d scan of baby for almost every week!

I can‚Äôt say enough about this app! I love everything about it and the best THE BEST PART IS NO COMMUNITY! Some other apps have a community portal and the people are so horribly rude and nasty. Idk why anyone would pay $50 a year for a crappy app with zero support and rude people. Pregnancy + is the absolute best app I‚Äôve ever downloaded for pregnancy support! And to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù it‚Äôs full potential is only $2! This app has won my heart üíú thank you for creating this app! So supportive and informative with lots of great things like contraction counter, different loggers like weight and even appt reminders, even a checklist for hospital/birth center bags. This is number 1 go to app and I‚Äôve had 8 babies! I recommend this app to everyone.

                      Title: This has been my go to prego app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my second pregnancy and by far my favorite prego app.  Love the weekly photos and ‚Äúactual size‚Äù images. The articles are typically interesting and relatable.  I just spent the $1.99 to purchase the app, figuring I at least owe it to the company for building an app I use regularly and enjoy. My complaint is the kick counter... there needs to be two options to count kicks. Unlike most are taught kicks are not only about how many you get in a certain amount of time, but it‚Äôs more about finding your baby‚Äôs pattern, what time of day you feel kicks and for how long. I now use a second kicks count app that allows me to mark what time of day baby is moving, but would love if it were integrated into this app. After a pregnancy loss at 36 weeks you learn exactly how important movement is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an amazing app to track your pregnancy! It was my number one pregnancy tracking app in the beginning. But when I was around 20 weeks the picture on the app did not match how many weeks pregnant I was. Like it would show me my baby at 21 weeks when I am only 20 weeks. And it did that throughout the entire app. I deleted the app and recently downloaded it back now that I am 35 weeks and I still have the same problem. Please fix this! It‚Äôs an amazing app besides this glitch. If this is changed, I will give the app 5 stars.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I had the app when I found out I was pregnant with my first baby girl, however I recently after giving birth on May 15th this year came back into the app & somehow my info changed & I couldn‚Äôt change it back. Like my due date was May 19th-2019 but it said a different date and I tried fixing it but it wouldn‚Äôt let me pick my dam due date to fix it even if i already had my baby. You should really fix it because I was loving the app since it was my first baby & wanted to keep the memory of it...I had to reset my app with all the memories  of my daughter & I'm very upset about it..maybe I‚Äôm the only one but this was sentimental to me seeing I wasn‚Äôt able to have kids at all & she was my miracle & rainbow baby. I wanted to keep the app & all the info for my memories & safe keeping but it wouldn‚Äôt let me simply change it back to my due date/day she was born, it needs an option to go back whether the date was another year or whatever.

                      Title: Sizing and info off
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I used this app exclusively for my first pregnancy in 2015 and loved it. Accurate info and better images. However, I was disappointed to discover this time around that they changed the beautiful images they once had, and the biggest of all, their baby sizing and info is NOT correct. I am getting ultrasounds every 2 weeks since 6 weeks and the sizing is off by a week. They tried to tell me its due to some weird setting and it‚Äôs not - their info is just incorrect. Also, this is insane, baby size jumps from 6 inches at 18 weeks to over 10 inches at 19 weeks?! Absolutely does not match information that‚Äôs out there, nor the actual real life sizing according to my US‚Äôs, which have been lining up with other apps. I am disappointed in this app this time around and have been using others. Seems like they changed drastically from their earlier days - which were better IMO.

The reason why I‚Äôve given four stars & state almost perfect is because, I‚Äôm a first time mom with a twin pregnancy & there are very little short glimpses of anything pertaining to a twin pregnancy. Please developers take pregnant mothers with twins into consideration without this app. For example, make an option in registration that asks if you are expecting twins & there genders, put more twin ultrasound images in the week photos Of the babies, place articles that can relate to twins mothers as well. I love the articles, I read them while in my 4 hour infusions to help me stay positive and distracted. I‚Äôm having a high risk pregnancy and I haven‚Äôt been able to keep down any liquids or food for the last 5 months, your app has given me hope.

I love the weekly updated pictures of what baby looks like inside. I have a place to put my own weekly pictures and notes. There is an option to add appointments in and much more! The only thing I wish it had was a way to customize your front page so I could add things I want to see every time I open the app also I wish there was a way to search for my specific questions. I still give this app a 5 stars!

I absolutely love this app, it‚Äôs super easy to use and always has very useful information! The only tip I could think of is to maybe send out push notifications on like weekly updates when you go into a new week of your pregnancy or to a new trimester. Like I said though, the app is amazing and helps me stay sane between OB appointments!!

He responds ‚Äúokay so 6 weeks.‚Äù I felt so dumb I had to open the app and show him where I was getting 8 weeks from! So embarrassing and scary since we all thought something must be seriously wrong.

Sorry, but this app is pointless past 14 weeks. I'm 29 weeks and just downloaded it, only to find that I can't even read the weekly pregnancy updates (after 14 weeks) without paying to upgrade. I understand having paid features, but they're going about it the wrong way. The weekly updates are the main reason people seek out these types of apps, and should not be what we have to pay for.

We love the app! The information is great and it‚Äôs so nice that it lets you log so many important things such as appointments, your weight and birth plan notes. We would love to recommend it to our friends, but we‚Äôd like one option added. When a man signs up to follow along with the development of his baby, he should have the option of logging in as a spouse and being greeted as a ‚Äúhusband‚Äù not just a ‚Äúpartner‚Äù. Those of us who are married and awaiting the birth of their baby would very much appreciate this option. Thank you in advance!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I enjoyed this app. The videos were cute and the home screen is flattering. Simple & functional. It was my go to. It did only go up to like week 14 && then you have to pay a fee to continue & enjoy it. I didn‚Äôt do it though because I had another baby app what to expect when expecting and it‚Äôs free all the way. I do think this app was easier & majority of the time my go to. The other one offers more info though as well as articles, versus this one had the cute baby pics every week that stood out and the layout was much easier to navigate. But I did thoroughly enjoy this one and would recommend it to everyone.

I downloaded several different apps when I first found out I was expecting again. At first this one wasn‚Äôt my favorite because it had a lot of the features blocked that you had to pay to access (as most of them do), however, they now offer a lot more and it‚Äôs amazing! I look forward to my update every week and I‚Äôm super thankful for all the people that put effort into this app. It helps me and my husband to see what‚Äôs coming and what to expect. 10/10 I will recommend this app to every pregnant lady that asks!

Missing my wife‚Äôs pregnancy due to the Military was rough, but I truly feel like this app helped ease my mind. It‚Äôs very easy to use and tracks the entire pregnancy. Whenever I wondered how big my son was or had questions about the pregnancy this app literally had all the answers. It‚Äôs a great way to stay connected with your spouse for the entirety of your pregnancy whether you‚Äôre geographically separated or together. Also it won‚Äôt let you forget what week you‚Äôre on so I was always on the ball when it came to sending my wife a nice text or call every week of progress.

I looked forward to seeing my ‚Äúvirtual baby‚Äù grow week by week and reading all the the information about his wellbeing and growth. My little 4 year old daughter fell in love with the virtual baby! She loved touching the screen to make him move around and make baby expressions in the ‚Äúwomb.‚Äù This app was very helpful and extremely fun to have on hand. I would recommend this app for anyone going through pregnancy whether it‚Äôs your first or 4th! Great app!!

                      Title: Trigger Warnings Needed
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For someone who has PTSD surrounding cancer, this app does a terrible job at proving trigger warnings. I.e they do not at all. I pulled up an article that was suggested for me on that day and it was incredibly triggering to my PTSD. There were no warnings at all and the article presented facts that were honestly written in a way that was anxiety inducing. On top of all this, this app also tells you very little about what is actually going on with your baby compared to other apps where there is a lot more information. They also have some outdated information about chromosomal abnormalities tests. Overall, I liked this app to begin with but I had to delete it because their articles have been triggering anxiety for me more than once now. I wish the app developer would include content warnings before you click on the articles.

So, so far this has been the best pregnancy app that ive been using. I LOVED it UNTIL I purchased the upgrade to get the kicker and contractions!! First off I don‚Äôt do military time and there is no option to change it as far as I can find. Second... and the biggest problem with this app for me is that every time I go to log a contraction, pressing start keeps deleting all my contraction history üò° what‚Äôs the point of keeping track of it if it keeping only giving you an option to delete when pressing start! Last one.. I hate that the app keeps saying I‚Äôm a week ahead even when I changed the setting to current. Other then those 3 things important thing, I really like the app. But Unfortunately LOVED turned into LIKE.

Downloaded this app and another one when I found out I was pregnant, I rarely pay for an app upfront because I'm particular about the usefulness and layout. I felt like this app was okay, but from a design/navigation standpoint it's too busy for me. I preferred the simplicity of the other app over this one and therefore used this one far less, however I would still check it on occasion. That was until I was over 14 weeks and was unable to access anything without paying.

This is a wonderful pregnancy app so far. My only issue is not being able to tell what an ultrasound would look like because you have it as a twin ultrasound. The twin ultrasounds are great for those having twins and I hope someday you can have a button to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having multiples‚Äù or just ‚Äúa single baby‚Äù so those who are having more than one can see that their ultrasounds will look similar to the twin ones and that those who are only having one can get a rough idea of what their ultrasound will look like or should look like.

I was excited when this app popped up because I used it with my first pregnancy with my son, and couldn‚Äôt wait to use it again. When I logged in, it kept saying my due date was out of bounds (because my son was born in 2018). When I tried to change the information to have a new due date, the app said that I would have to create a new Phillips account. So I tried to do that, only to be told that 2 accounts with the same email can‚Äôt exist. I do not have and do not want a second email. I‚Äôve used several apps for both pregnancies so far and all of the other ones let me add a new pregnancy to an existing account. I‚Äôm not sure why this app thinks that you can only have one child, but it‚Äôs extremely disappointing.

I absolutely loved the app for my singleton pregnancy and would recommend it to any moms expecting one baby. And was eager to explore the app after finding out I was having twins! Was extremely disappointed to start off with the fact that they don‚Äôt have a twin pregnancy feature. You can change the gender from boy to girl to twins. But that is it! I kept the app because each week they have a nice little twins/ multiples article. As my pregnancy progresses, I am growing more disappointed as the articles are really more like fun facts about twins rather than information about your twin pregnancy that week. With multiple pregnancies on the rise, you should really do better for other moms!

There‚Äôs no way the baby is that big at 20 weeks and it does this EVERY week. It always says the baby is twice as big as it actually is. That‚Äôs why I had to delete it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you! I deleted my other apps because my young kids were confused as to why the baby didn‚Äôt look like them. Especially because we have very dark skin. It made me sad. When I saw that this app had a diversity of babies I downloaded and to my surprise the app outside of just that feature is amazing. What foresight and consideration you all have . Thank you! I can‚Äôt wait to show my kids their developing sibling when they wake up.

I‚Äôm 33 weeks pregnant and have been using this app since day one. Earlier this week I had a problem with the daily blog not updating which was a total bummer because it‚Äôs what I look forward to reading every day. I wrote a review about this issue and the developers wrote back with advice to clear my cache, and it cleared everything up. I got my daily blog back and am enjoying the app daily again.

This is my go-to app even though I have others downloaded. The only thing I don't like is how the babies look. I am black and I look nothing like the black baby that's featured (even though she's a cutie.) It's a bit stereotypical. Maybe I'm asking for too much with a slight customization to make me feel like I'm actually looking at my child. Other than that I really like this app. I would pay for it if I could change what my baby looks like.

I have loved using the pregnancy app so far and have already downloaded the Baby+ app for when munchkin decides to arrive. The daily advice and blogs have been helpful time and time again. The only downside I have had with the app is paying $4.99 to access all of the features. Well worth it, but still kind of disappointing that you have to pay to be up to date/synced with where your baby is at stage wise. Outside of that it has been wonderful.

From the very beginning, I loved the design and functionality of this app. I do have a problem with it‚Äôs accuracy, however. Every measurement along the way has been a week off. It says my baby should be measuring at the week ahead of reality. I kept using it, despite this flaw, but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to pay for an app that I have to manually scroll back on measurements to get an accurate number. I hope this is a problem that is fixed, because it really could be a great prenatal companion app.

I really liked the app. It was clean, the graphics we nice and it was user friendly. I used it from the moment I found out I was pregnant to 15 weeks.

You can use other free apps to get all the information that you need on the growth of your baby. What to Expect, The Bump and Baby Center just to name a few.

Been using the app throughout both of my pregnancies! I just love checking the images and notes of baby‚Äôs development and every week the app provides tips and heads ups to deal with possible risk/questions any mum could have, some are even for the partners. Love it and for any of you still looking, just pay for the premium version. It‚Äôs worth it!

The information provided is practical and helpful; much better than other similar apps (of which I have several!). Every week, this was the app I went to to find out what new was happening with my developing little one.

I love the fact that it is 3d and you're able to interact with the baby.

Who else likes this idea?!

I enjoyed this app throughout my first trimester. Particularly being able to see the different pictures of babies at various gestational ages. For me though, the "one time small fee" of $4.99 wasn't worth it. Not when there are so many other great free apps. I realize that those apps may include ads or make use of user data, but I just have a rule about not paying for apps when there are comparable free versions available.

I do not like how the app gives African Americans hair a nappy look. The rest of the baby options hair is nice and laid down. However the black baby hair looks as if the hairs are just bushy. When all babies come out I can say hair texture is the same. I really think that‚Äôs a total disrespect to my race and overall that really sets the tone for horrible app. The moms stomach growth is white. Why no option for people of color there too. Everything seems to be catered to white people this is completely disrespectful and unfair. So I will be deleting this app until they can get it right.

This was fun until the most recent update, now my ‚Äú1.6 inch‚Äù baby is showing as just 3/4 inch when I click the actual size button. I have an iPhone SE and I suspect the size is designed to be the proper size on bigger, newer phones like the X and the like. It would be really nice if they could fix this so the size displays properly across different phone models.

Many features of the app are blocked unless you pay for it, which initially does not seem to matter. However, in your second trimester you can no longer use the app unless you pay. I have 5 pregnancy apps on my phone and this app is no different then any other pregnancy app, it doesn't provide anything the others don't, so don't waste your time cause all the others are truly free!

I know this is basically impossible to find in the realm of pregnancy tracking apps, but I would love to see some options and language that reflect the fact that not all pregnant people are ‚Äúwomen.‚Äù Trans men and non-binary folks also have babies. I was hopeful the personalization options would allow for that, but alas, no luck here.

Not sure how the black baby got that much melanin without any sun exposure in utero. The hair is also standing up, unlike the other baby selections, which I‚Äôve never seen on a live black newborn. Otherwise, I like being able to follow what the baby looks like each week.

This app is great when it comes to letting you know what‚Äôs going on in the various stages of pregnancy. It gives you an option to choose a Caucasian or African American child, and the visual for the black baby is pretty disturbing. The baby has a huge nose, and large glossed lips. Meanwhile the Caucasian baby looks quite proportional. This rubbed me the wrong way so I obviously got rid of the app.

This application is okay for use. My only issue is the characteristic for a African American baby when it comes to hair. When all babies are born they all have the same texture of hair. The hair doesn‚Äôt change for at least 6 to 7 months after the baby is born. How the image is depicted comes across racist and bias. To whom ever created this app need to change how the African American child is featured as a baby.

I‚Äôm sorry but there are way more apps I can go to and still not be charged for what call consider ‚Äúextra‚Äù or ‚Äúpremium‚Äù if you want a good pregnancy app that‚Äôs not a scam I‚Äôd suggest ovia I've used it for years I even got pregnant both times using the period app they make. Don‚Äôt let these people rip you off. It‚Äôs not worth it. Spend that money on the baby and not an app.

The app wants you to pay for the pro version after 14 weeks. I was pretty disappointed by that so I ended up downloading the Ovia pregnancy app which has the same information and even adds in a pregnancy calendar that this one doesn‚Äôt have. Bottom line it‚Äôs ok but not worth buying the pro version.

I love this app for its general informational purposes and tracking purposes, and I wish I could give it five stars. However, there‚Äôs a very evident push to persuade mothers to breastfeed, with one article even explicitly stating: ‚ÄúBreastfeeding is still the best.‚Äù  This type of explicit pressuring is incredibly insensitive to the mothers for whom breastfeeding isn‚Äôt an option, and disregards very recent research that suggests that, while there may be some genuine medical and emotional benefits to breast feeding, a generous portion of the difference in health and behavioral metrics for breastfed versus formula fed babies are actually due to socioeconomic conditions that would better account for the purported benefits of breastfeeding- socioeconomic factors that were never controlled for in most of the most widely cited articles by breastfeeding advocates. Even as a breastfeeding mother, I find, as do many medical professionals in the field, that taking a hardline stance is irresponsible at best. Mothers deserve a full breadth of education on both choices in order to make their own decisions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Very comprehensive & great overall layout! This was my favorite pregnancy app (used in conjunction with the Baby Center & What to Expect When You're Expecting apps). I liked getting the weekly push notifications for how the baby was progressing & what to expect/do/learn each week. I read the daily info & blogs at my leisure. I really, really like the kick count icon bc it lets you exit the app & go back to continue your kick count. I also liked logging my own stats separately (weight, appts w/my blood pressure & baby's heartbeat count, bump pics, etc.). They have the best breakdown of baby's weekly size, weight, & length & info as well. Overall, I think this app gives the best practical & helpful info in an easy to use & view format. I would recommend using this as the main app & Baby Center app for tips on purchasing baby products & other "is this normal?" info (their layout isn't as helpful though & they don't let you save articles each week in a "to read" list like Facebook, so you have to remember to go back to it). I already recommended this app to friends. Worth paying the upgrade fee!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app offered insightful information from day one of my pregnancy. I found the daily and weekly information to be extremely helpful and surprisingly spot on when I needed it the most.  All of the features offered give you tons of minor and major information throughout your journey including sizes as compared to fruits and veggies, images of the baby at each month, ultrasound examples, and everything in between. The app also made it super easy to find and save baby names that you like from a incorporated database as well as creating your own. You can also make lists to email to yourself that include what you are packing in your hospital bag as well as setting up your birth plan from a variety of options you can select or create yourself. I am actually kind of sad that it's all done. I think I will have to check out their baby app too! I highly recommend this app to anyone new and starting their pregnancy journey, it was well worth the money!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love love love this app. It's always nice to refer to this app for daily information. It really also helps to refer to this app on weekly basis. The only reason why I gave it four stars is because the pictures don't back up from one device to another. Since it's from the same account one would think that the pictures would back up to be able to be loaded onto the whole account instead of the device itself. Otherwise this is a wonderful app it keeps you informed on your babies progress, on your own progress, and gives you weekly and daily information which is vital to one's pregnancy. And it also gives you a list of name choices and even a place for you to put your names that don't exist on their favorite names. I recommend this app for anyone who is pregnant but has or know someone that's pregnant. This app provides a lot of suggestions that are vital for one's pregnancy such as packing a baby bag, packing your hospital bag, Doctors appointments, sonogram pictures, etc.‚Ä¶ Really good app. I really recommend it good work!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app. The illustrations are beautiful, and I love the amount of info they give you -- just the right amount of daily and weekly updates. It's great having the weight tracker and appointments in the app (I always record my bp and the baby's heart rate!), as well as the timeline, baby size guide, names section and even hospital bag/birth plan check lists. It's really well organized. There's a kick counter that looks good, too that I will probably start using soon as well (I'm 27 weeks and definitely feeling lots of movement!). I'm a minimalist, so I didn't want to have multiple pregnancy apps and I'm so glad that this is the one I went with. I specifically didn't want one with message boards because they just make me anxious and for me they're not helpful -- if I have questions or concerns I'd rather just ask my doctor or family/friends. This app is completely worth the modest price once you get out of the first trimester and I would definitely recommend it.

I also love the images they provide because It gives me an idea of how my little one is growing each day. I love all the features because i can see how my body is changing and put in information about my self. My partner also has used the app with me and he was the one that got me to purchase the full version because we could tell it was a very useful app. I would recommend this app to all the new parents like us because it helps us get more inform.

                      Title: The Best Pregnancy App worth the $3.99
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been pregnant, now, seven times. I have used many different pregnancy applications both free & paid. I have to say this is the most complete, most advanced, most accurate application. With these other apps I generally know all the weekly pregnancy info they provide having done this a few times & read many books on pregnancy. However with this app I've actually been surprised by some information, which was very cool. The other thing I enjoyed that seems minor but, I was happy with, was when referring to  "morning sickness" it said something like "by now most moms are feeling better but there are a few who still have morning sickness". I have hyperemesis grevardium & it last for me from about 7-9 weeks all the way to sometimes after I deliver. It's a minor note but it's always a little annoying when books & apps assure me I am "now over the nausea" when I know I'm not even half there yet. Paying for this app was a no brainer for me.

When my wife surprised me with the wonderful news we were hoping for I was very excited! I also wanted to make sure I was with her every step of the way and one step ahead of her if I could. I got the app and used it free for the first 15 weeks and I decided to buy it. Best couple dollars I have ever spent. Pregnancy plus has helped me understand the day to day changes happening with my wife's body physically as well as emotionally.  Learning the daily development of our child has been amazing and has helped to deepen our bond. Daily tips, suggestions on everything from health, diet and exercise, to helping pick out baby names and advice on setting up the nursery. This app has it all and we are all learning from it. Also gave me lots of "good husband points" staying in tune with my wife's needs. Also a lot of fun with the weekly development pictures of the baby. I recommend this app to everyone going through pregnancy. Especially first time moms and dads.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

When I found out I was pregnant which was very early on, I downloaded at least 6 difficulty pregnancy app and this one is by far the best. Everything you need is right where you can see it, you can keep track of everything easily. It's really good. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they have daily blogs on the home page that are usually helpful but other times they were just awful and (had I not already had two kids) some of the stuff they wrote about just promotes fear in pregnant women. These apps need to be more positive. Birth is natural, birth is normal. Keeping a calm, positive attitude is better than reading everyone's horror birth stories. No, I do not want to hear about your emergency or scheduled c-section. Other than those few blogs, it's a good app.

Really easy to use! Gives you different type of scans to see what your baby would look like ! Love how it shows your done with one week and shows your what will be happening during the week that you are currently in. Only down side is for Free app only shows baby's development up to 15weeks & you have to Pay $3.99 for the rest of the weeks, but it comes with other incentives as well that you can use to your discretion...i feel this app should offer all 40weeks development for free. I really like this app because it's shows baby more realistically than other apps that use anime/cartoonish babies. Everyone should give it a try ! I think I downloaded about every app in the store I stuck with this one & What To Expect ! Both are great !

My only real complaint is it does not sink with my iPad and you have to pay twice if you want it on your iPad and iPhone.

I absolutely loved and enjoyed every week of this app as it guided me with my progress. Very much accurate. Well detailed & expressed. However, I do recommend to the creators of this app to add a feature for those parents or mothers that deliver early, premature baby. As, I myself being one of many early delivering mothers wish I had the option to edit/update within this app to proceed to educate me in those moments when my baby was in the incubator etc. Please look into that & this app is that much closer to being amazing!!!! Regardless, thank you! I will keep my app until we're ready for baby #2. Hopefully by then you will have added that additional detail. Prematurity. Thank You! Best Regards -Yadira

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app, I like that I don't have to pay for it until 15 weeks as someone who has suffered a miscarriage before this pregnancy, I would hate to have paid for it and then lost the baby. It's common knowledge that the risk of having a miscarriage goes down after the first trimester so the people complaining about it being a lite version should take that into consideration. My only complaint is that the app tells me I'm 12 weeks 1 day pregnant when I'm actually 12 weeks 2 days pregnant but then it also tells me I have 27 weeks and 5 days left so what happened to the 7th day? Maybe just a bug that needs to be fixed. Overall great app , can't wait to purchase the full version in a couple weeks!

This app is great for first time moms. My parents and my in-laws live in different states as do all our siblings and family, so this up was very helpful for me as I didn't have people close by to ask questions or get advice. I love discovering the size of baby each week, the weight tracker, and the pictures. So far the app has been on point with info and advice and always seems to come right when I am experiencing it for myself - it's great. The only thing I wish was better was once the second trimester starts the baby pictures are harder to see.. Whether they are blurry or zoomed in, is rather see a full "picture" of what the baby might look like at this stage instead of just the hand or up close face.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Over all, I like this app BUT it waited until I was 28 weeks pregnant to tell me that the free trial period was up and I had to pay $3.99 for the full version. If I would have known that, I would have done it 28 weeks ago. Now it's like I'm forced to buy it and I won't be using it after the baby comes so why waste $4 for a few more weeks of use? I'm promptly deleting it just on principal. Not fair guys! Some apps I've had on my phone for years and actually get some use out of. Those apps were not even close to $4. This app is just a glorified ticker if you don't have the full app. At 14 weeks it also stops showing you images of the actual size of your baby. It also stops giving you updates on your baby. Your better off downloading "What to expect when your expecting" app or "baby center" app, which are born FREE! I don't mind paying for apps, but I want to be able to use them, so this one is a waste.

I'm pregnant with my fourth baby I do like what to expect and baby center as well, as those are what I have used in previous pregnancies but I am still learning new things every day. This app has a lot of very useful information as well as interactive tools and fun too. I love watching the slide show of the growing fetus turn into a baby it is very realistic and this app also allows you to track your progress like many other but I will be able to look back at my journey farther down the road and remember the smaller details I will soon forget. It's like an informational journal with interactive tools. I have the pro version and am very pleased with my purchase. The name finder is also fun.

I love this app! It's very user friendly and has a ton of info not just on your babies development but it also includes blogs, and facts on everything from where you're at in your current state of pregnancy. My one complaint however, is that I miscarried about three weeks ago. To my surprise there was an option to put you miscarried but I am still getting notifications every week telling me I am "8 weeks pregnant" and so on. I know I could just delete the app and call it good but we're trying for another and I'm wanting to use it again. It's kind of like salt to the wound with every week seeing how far along I would have been. I have even restarted the app but I am still getting these notifications every week.  Developers... If you could fix this I would very happily give you 5 stars :)

At the beginning of my pregnancy I added a bunch of apps to follow along week to week. This is the only app that I kept...and well worth the small amount of money! It shows you week to week in a detailed description how you your baby should be developing. As and added bonus there is a small daily blog to address experiences you will have, answering questions that you will wonder about along the way! Also included are weekly size charts, contraction monitoring, calendars for your weight and appointments, places to add notes and pictures to track during your pregnancy and more! I really began looking at this on a regular basis and will be purchasing the next app for my babies first year! I highly recommend!

The tone of most passages is similar to "What to Expect When You're Expecting," thus, expect a lot of cliches about male and female approaches to pregnancy.

                      Title: Great app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was looking for an app that doesn't require you to register with an email address. If I wanted a bunch of crap coming into my inbox I wouldn't buy an app, I'd subscribe to an enewsletter. This one fits the bill and has really awesome graphics. It also doesn't have a ton of useless info and features like some of the others (this is my second pregnancy so I know what info is most important). I show the images to my daughter each week and she loves learning about her growing brother or sister. The only downside is that it's not really free-after you are 14 weeks you have to do the in-app purchase to keep getting new content. Still, I'd rather pay the $4 then use a free app that floods my inbox with emails and offers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my second pregnancy and I wanted something different. I didn't have access to apps last time so enjoyed hunting around for a good one. We had the free version for awhile before my husband upgraded it for me. I thought the to do list and shopping list were amusing and fairly handy but since I'm having a home birth, the hospital bag option was useless. It was also confusing at first to figure out how the contraction timer worked. But it was fun overall. My two yr. loves looking at the weekly pictures of the baby and watching the progression video. Biology crash course, right? üòâ

                      Title: It was a good app until....
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I downloaded this app when I found out I was pregnant, which was at about 5 weeks. So I've had this for a little while, and it's such a great app for pregnant women to have. The images of what a 2D, 3D ultrasound would look like at whatever point you're at in your pregnancy, even an animated look which I thought was amazing. It was very informative about what to expect, what symptoms you would be having at the time, etc. BUT, once you get closer to 15 weeks, they start showing you less things unless you pay for it, and by week 15 you can't see ANYTHING. I thought this was extremely unfair! I can't stand apps that force you to pay for it, especially now in this situation where all I wanna do is watch my baby grow and be informed as well as I have been for the passed 10 weeks. Sorry, but 2 stars for this stupidity.

                      Title: Upgrade
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This was by far my favorite app to use during the beginning of my pregnancy but once I reached 15 weeks I have to upgrade to be able to see any new weekly information, including the ultrasound pictures they provide each week. I haven't been able to find another app that I like as much as this one and I'm disappointed. This app needs to be completely free. We already have a lot to pay for when the baby gets here, don't make us pay for an app on a phone that we won't keep forever. On the other hand, it isn't too expensive and I was very unhappy with all of the other apps I tried because none of them were as detailed as this one. I love this app and will use it for my next pregnancy as well.

I used this app from 6 weeks and on. I'm a 1st time mom so it was specially exciting for me to read about the changes my baby and I were going through. I like the baby ultrasounds, the fruit/baby size comparison, but my favorite part was the "partner's advice". My husband looked forward to resin the weekly updates on baby and I and the partner info really helped him understand what his roll was and how he could be involved and helpful. The descriptions under "your body" were 90% accurate and I would find myself laughing because it was exactly what I was going through that week. Thank you!

I'm kind of annoyed that people give this app poor reviews because full features are only unlocked for free through week 14.  It tells you that in advance. And don't be cheap people.  I'm about to get pregnant again and my original 2.99 has gone a long long way and now will guide me through a new baby.  The information in this app is beyond tracking weight and weekly bump pictures which I loved) and fetus size updates.  There are helpful guides, time-appropriate short articles and reminders along the way, so it was well worth it for me.

I love all the other features as well! It tracks ur weight, baby, ur belly photos, size and weight of baby, articles regarding concerns, questions, and things to expect, shows time frames of each month, and waaay more. I'm now in my last month of pregnancy and still very pleased with this app!! Highly recommend the purchase to continue throughout ur entire pregnancy!! Love, love, love it!!!

This is my favorite app for obtaining information regarding the status of my pregnancy, baby's development, and my body. I love that they make an effort to include the partner as well in the week-by-week discussion. Of all the information I have at my fingertips, I make sure to share the weekly updates from this app with my husband so he can read about and see baby's development. I also love the illustrated anatomical images of the fetus, as well as the user-generated 2D and 3D scans at each week. Lastly, the link to the makers' blog with a rich wealth of information, is a wonderful added bonus.

First off, the app somehow allows you to make an in-app purchase without creating an account for authorization. After creating the account it doesn't sync any information or remember that you made a purchase, therefore misleading you to purchase it again on another device. Their FAQ  states "As long as you sign into the same App Store account you used to purchase the Pregnancy App the first time, you will never have to pay twice. Under the ‚ÄòBuy the App‚Äô button there‚Äôs a ‚ÄòRestore your purchase‚Äô link."

It also has information that changes daily in a variety of topics, weight tracker, important information for drs apts, blogs to read and discuss things on, and it gives you so much more options. (TOO many to list) the only option I don't like is to continue using the app you have to pay 3.99$ after 15wks. If your further along than that you can't see anything. TOTALY worth it though.....üòç

I downloaded all of the major pregnancy apps and have been using all of them. Now almost halfway through my pregnancy, I can say without a doubt that this is the best one. The weekly and daily information is great (not all apps have something new for you every day). The weight tracker is the easiest to use of all the apps. Has important functions like contraction counter and kick counter, and some bonuses that are really useful like the baby name list (you can search or add your own), list managers, birth plan, and various guides that provide useful information.

If you like to have something new to read everyday and have an app that organizes your pregnancy, this is for you. You can keep track of your appointments, new baby shopping items to keep track what you have and what you need, and you can even track contractions when you get to that point. You can browse possible names and bookmark them as you are deciding, see images comparable to your baby's growth, and even store pictures of your belly growth to review your timeline over the months. Lots of neat features.

It includes illustrations as well as actual ultrasound pics weekly plus tells you the average length and weight of your baby week by week. It has the fruit/vegetable comparison which I like as well. Lots of helpful tabs to click with useful information.  You can enter your own info and pics as well.  I deleted all the other apps and just use this one exclusively now.

All of these things made me feel more connected to my son when he was gestating. I utilized the appointment section, weight tracking, hospital bag check list, birth plan, and name suggestion sections. One of my favorite tools was the kick counter. Even my 6 year old daughter had fun using the kick counter.

I can go to one place & see all my babies pictures. Yes, I'm aware I could just look at my phones photo log, but something about it being on this app makes it much more special. I haven't had one issue with the app since I purchased it.

I found the checklists very helpful (especially for my first) and enjoyed reading the weekly updates about what baby was up to and the changes my body was going through. My toddlers also loved following along with the size chart and would often ask what fruit is the baby now? It was fun to show them pics too of the baby as it would be developing in the uterus. Great App for me and my family enjoyed it too! Highly recommend especially for first time Mums.

Also towards the end weeks the daily blog seems to skip back to earlier topics and even took me to "week 16" when I was in the final month. The constant warning messages that pop up during contraction timer usage were annoying. Other than these editing issues I found the app to be very user friendly and include all my needs.

Not saying that you shouldn't go to the doctor because that is key but this app tells you the very same thing your doctor would. I highly recommend this app to any women who is expecting. I loveeee ittt... üòç

                      Title: Recommended app!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I had another pregnancy app but their daily tidbits didn't coordinate with the pregnancy timeline so at 19 weeks I started looking for another app. I tried about 8 others including this one. I love the daily tidbits and the weekly updates are very detailed. There's a lot of extra features with this app. This is my 2nd pregnancy and I read several books with the first, and I enjoy reading a out health and our bodies so I found this one to be accurate and up to date. I would highly recommend this app!!! Worth the money!!!!

                      Title: Could be better
--------------------------------------------------------------------

First off, I find it annoying that they want a weekly check in for weight. Second, the pictures have been trimmed since last update, so bottom of weekly pics are simply cut off. Another thing I noticed, is that the pictures seem to be in disorder, especially in the 2nd and 3rd trimester. For example, week 29 you have what seems to be a developed baby, then the pictures for week 30 and 31 are of an under developed baby. Then all of a sudden, go to the next week (32), and you have a plump baby. Week 34 and 35 also seems out of place. Week 27 is a terrible picture where you don't see the head at all.

After multiple miscarriages, ectopic pregnancy where I lost a tube, 2 failed fertility cycles my husband and I decided to adopt. 3 weeks after our sons adoption we got pregnant on our own. I am almost 11 weeks (longest pregnancy we've ever had) and everything is going on target per not only my OB but this app as well so I can see the point of the app being free until 13 weeks. You just never know what can happen. I plan on buying this app then.

I find it extremely useful and worth the small amount of money it costs to access everything it has to offer. :)

It's also nice to be able to show my daughter & nieces what the baby looks like & the size the baby is. I recommend this app to any one who is expecting.

This app is amazing. By far has the most information and love the format and layout. But I have to pay to get full use? It's hard to find good information and apps that give good insight to a pregnancy like this app. But I'm not paying to "unlock all features". I'll just google or find another app. I understand a person/company needs to make money for their hard work and what not but I'm just not feeling the vibe that I get when I think of paying an app to help me better understand my own pregnancy and get peace of mind. But again, it's a great app information wise.

It's also easier to hand this app over to my husband (versus a book) when he's curious. Possibly would have been more inclined to use other features if I had downloaded app at beginning of my pregnancy. Definitely would recommend this app to other expectant moms.

My husband and I have lost several pregnancies, I appreciated that we didn't have to pay until past 14 weeks. It's a small thing, but it gave me something to look forward to being able to purchase the full version. I would recommend this to any new or veteran parents!

I even tried resetting my password and it still told me my email didn't exist with an account. Being that I just found out I'm pregnant, I just created a new account. Hopefully, it works now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app has the most life-like graphic interpretations of a growing fetus, which is great. It also has a lot of interesting tools. The information, however, is a little biased and unreasearched. For instance, there is no actual proof that what you eat changes the flavor of your amniotic fluid, so don't tell me that my baby will "taste" everything I eat. Also, don't tell me that I should "expect interventions during labor, such as pitocin or a C-section." Interventions can be almost always be avoided, so I don't appreciate an app telling me that I should expect these changes to my birth plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

My husband and I love this app. When I found out I was pregnant I downloaded every baby app because I wanted to know what was going on with my baby. This app is the only one that I liked and was easy to understand! We enjoy finding out our baby's milestones every week and it helps with a lot of questions so I am not blowing up my doctors phone! I highly recommend this app and I will definitely use it again in future pregnancies.

This app has everything! I love being able to show my family what the baby should look like, and how the baby is positioned inside of me. They help you with your birth plan and what you'll need to prepare for the baby and its nursery. They show you what you actually need instead of what people get extra that just make stores money. It makes me even more excited for my baby to get here and it satisfies my need to plan ahead!

Used thus throughout my first pregnancy and it's great! Totally worth the money after the first trimester! #1 best thing about the app is that many of us wonder what baby looks like! Every week this app shows what baby would look like on ultrasound and on 3D or 4D! I also like being able to record my belly size every month and the scale chart for weight as well as daily updates and not just weekly ones! Thank you!!

I especially love the video & pictures so I can share with my kids how big the baby is & what she kinda looks like at each week. Thanks for supplying such a wonderful app for us mamas to be!

Also there are many articles about staying active and fit throughout your or your partners pregnancy! Exceptional App!

I would like it better if I got to see the whole baby not just the face. Other than that, this app is amazing!!!

I also love that there are actual sonogram photos week by week. I love the daily/weekly info and the option for journaling. Didn't think I'd use that part, but some days, ya just need a place to write down symptoms or feelings or cravings. Must have for all soon-to-be mamas!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is very informative- as most of the pregnancy apps are.  However this one is just so much "cleaner" in its look and usability. The classy version of tracking your pregnancy. I love the weight tracker and the list builders. Also, the feature to write your birth plan makes it so easy by just ticking boxes, and it's so easy for others to read. Just simple bullets. No wordy paragraphs that annoy medical professionals anyway.

I liked this app in the beginning. It had good features like tracking your weight, descriptions of the baby and daily blogs (some helpful, some meh, some just wrong info). Then at my 14 week mark little padlock icons started showing up blocking the screen with "if you want to continue, please pay to unlock the rest of the app!" By week 15 the entire app (except the home page) is locked unless you pay. In order for sites to demand that you pay they've got to be pretty darn good, this is not one of them that is worth paying for. Deleted it, go with Ovia, whole thing is free.

My 6 year old LOVES Being able to see what her baby brother looks like (more or less) each week, and often asks me if she can see what the baby looks like right now. The information is also awesome, but it's really the images that sell the app. Love it!

This is my second time to use this app and I still love it. The pictures are amazing and it also has a lot of good information on the baby.

I definitely recommend this app to anyone.

Kept me busy at first but went through the info pretty quick.  Planning tools (appointment scheduler and weight tracker etc) were handy though.  Overall, most of these apps are pretty redundant, filled with mostly generic "official" recommendations that I learned in high school biology.  I'm a microbiologist and physician assistant and so I suppose I am looking for something that digs a little deeper into the less obvious, and even addresses the controversial issues and science of what makes for the healthiest pregnancy.

Also everyday there is a little tip of the day to help you have a safe and healthy pregnancy. I highly recommend this app to any pregnancy woman not just first time moms!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I paid for the full app because it said it would let me see info past 28 or so weeks, but it also promised tons of extra features. Paid for the full app, and didn't get one single extra feature. Rip off. Plus, it's pretty dumb that you have to choose baby names from their very limited list. You can't add your own to keep track of names you're actually thinking of using. Finally, half the daily blog posts are full of misinformation and are written not by healthcare professionals, but by first-time moms.

This is a good pregnancy app. It has a lot of helpful tips, information, and I LOVE the internal images of the growing baby. The size guide is fun to share with hubby ("Baby is the size of an avocado this week!") and I like the email function of weekly updates too. Only complaint is that you have to pay to continue after 12 weeks. :-(

I contacted someone by email to only be told that the app stops working on lite version at 13wks (not stated in the description btw), so disappointing app! Unless you dnt mind paying for it after the "trial period" as I'm calling it, dnt even bother installing. There's plenty more good quality pregnancy apps out there that offer the same services (baby's development and your body changes) FOR FREE! I'm actually loving one right now, that I started using just yesterday.

Had this app from very early pregnancy (found out at 3 weeks) and loved it, until we got to 15 weeks and found out we had to pay to keep using it - nowhere does it ever say you have to pay until you have a chance to fall in love with it and then have to pay. Granted, it's only $4, but I would rather have another app for free than pay that. Ovia is totally free, and cuter than this one - I recommend that one if you don't want to pay either!

This app is marketed as a pregnancy app when it should be  advertised at the first 14 weeks app because literally everything on the app becomes completely unavailable after that. And even during those short few weeks, there are many functions of the app that are unavailable to non-paying users. I didn't find anything original and/or different about this app compared to the HONESTLY a free ones that would make me want to pay $4 for it. It's absolutely ridiculous. Wish I didn't waste my time downloading it.

There are other pregnancy apps with better information than this one. Also, the movement and animation at the top is very annoying. Should only animate once when the app first loads.

This app was free with my first pregnancy, but now it requires you to upgrade and pay after 14weeks. The weekly updates are nice,but could be better. A significant portion of each week's information is for people with multiples. This is wasted on the average mom-to-be. Surely this app could ask for this information and include it for those that want it while omitting for those that do not.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a great app and I looked and heckled it everyday in my pregnancy until week 14 and then I got cut off unexpectedly because I had to pay for the rest of my weeks of pregnancy. Absolute crap !! What a serious rip off. You should make the Pro version like other period tracker apps that you can upgrade with cooler things as an incentive, not to track your 3/4 of pregnancy. Very upsetting. It honestly was the best pregnancy app that looked the best and had the best pictures and information. Pretty sad.

So I looked into another pregnancy app that was completely free and got the refresher info or places to look for it on the app.

I have deleted and reinstalled the app four times in an effort to get it to work properly again and nothing has worked.  Overall, a very disappointing experience.

This is very frustrating, I would like this fixed, every time I get back on I have to resign in and reenter the due date every time now. So I would like my info restored or a refund of my money!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app. It's simply amazing if you're pregnant and tells you so much. It's the best app I could find and I absolutely love it. I only rated it four stars because it would be even better if you got all the weeks free instead of 1-14 for free but I think even I might like it enough to find it worth it.

I used to use the app to show my class of 4 yr olds the different stages that the baby was at bc they are very excited about a baby growing in their teachers tummy.

If you want to see more than an arm or leg in the weekly pictures you also have to pay. Overall I am pretty disappointed and will be deleting this app and downloading a different one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I got this app for the beautiful pictures of the baby I could show my 3 year old.  But most everything else in the app requires buying it.  Plus I can't show my son any pictures after 1st trimester, when it needs to start becoming more real to him.  I use a different app for names and birth plan as it's more extensive (and actually free).

This app is mediocre. Some good information but I don't like the "tone" it takes to new mothers, at times inspiring fear and guilt. And it perpetuates some misconceptions, like that pregnant women can't eat soft cheese, when that's simply untrue (as long as the cheese is pasteurized and not blue vein, it should be safe). There are other apps out there that are better than this one.

I'm really glad I downloaded this on week 22 of my wife's pregnancy. I would have been upset having to pay for pictures past week 14 if I'd been following the whole time. Not worth it, plenty of free apps out there that are equal or better. Charge advertisers and not parents!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, this was a great purchase--This was one of the only pregnancy apps I could find that didn't talk down to me (What to Expect is awful, I deleted it after a few days--how insulting). The weekly summaries are great and helpful, and the images are beautiful. I just wish they'd show full-length images for each week, as some are a close-up of the face...I want to see the whole baby, not just the face! I also feel like there is way too much twin information...it should only pop up if the user selects multiples. You're reading about changes to expect in your body and then they always throw in a "if you're having multiples" tidbit. This is in addition to the separate multiples section! Just seems unnecessary since twins are not the norm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôm a mom of 5, expecting number 6, and a past childbirth instructor and doula. I honestly only downloaded this app to show my kids the baby‚Äôs development, and for that purpose, it‚Äôs fabulous! However, all of the articles and advice are either vague, not helpful (particularly for a veteran parent), or contain biased or incorrect information. What concerns me the most is the nutrition information. Yes, fruits and veggies are vital to a healthy pregnancy, but the push to avoid too many calories and eat lean meats is troubling. In order to increase blood volume, pregnant women require adequate protein‚Äî 90-100 grams a day and adding more when they‚Äôre active‚Äî and 2600 calories a day, adding more to make up for that burned in exercise/activity. Blood volume increase both helps to prevent preeclampsia and other pregnancy complications.

Love how this app says to download for FREE access but, what they fail to mention is you actually have to PAY for that access. If you‚Äôre so smart to make an app, I‚Äôm sure you would know the definition of what ‚Äúfree‚Äù means... sorry, but your misleading information means I don‚Äôt trust anything this app has to offer. I could care less that you don‚Äôt want my data and that free means there has to be ads. None of my other pregnancy apps are full of ads and they are FREE and do the EXACT same thing this app does... with a better screen format and easier usage. Why would I pay for this app when all the information you provide is not only free on the internet BUT also other apps.

BBC people have gotten very rude over the years so I think that a forum in this app could help people who just want advice or someone to share the journey with. I like that there is so much information on it about things I am going through right when I open the app. I get to use the pictures to show my other kids what little sis/bro looks like and they love it too!

                      Title: Devastated
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was happy with it for my first 7 months of pregnancy until my iPhone needed updating. For some reason the app would not update, therefore I deleted it from my phone( not my cloud) and re-downloaded it back to my phone. Upon doing this, the app did not recognize my email address once I tried logging on nor would it allow me to reset my password. Remember, I've had it 7 months and used it daily with auto log in so I had trouble remembering my password. Well, it never recognized my email address so I created a new account, which only allowed me to view the pre- inserted baby photos until the 15 week mark. I had purchased this app for $3.99, 7 months ago and have used it daily. All of my info was lost because it did not remember my account.My weekly pregnancy photos that I uploaded, my completed birthing plan, notes, doctor visit info, important and exciting info that I've gathered for all of my pregnancy to date. I am devastated. I would not recommend this app as whatever glitch was in their system on this day cost me valuable info, not to mention my $3.99. And I do not have long to go.

I like this app I love the pictures of the baby and the information is great. I don't like that the belly pictures are of a naked body... I don't know maybe it is just me but I don't really feel comfortable showing people what the baby looks like in the belly because they have to look at a naked butt.  Ha ha sorry I just don't want to make friends/family/coworkers feel uncomfortable... So I end up using my other app that just shows the belly.
