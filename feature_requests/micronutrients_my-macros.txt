                      Title: Ok app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôve tried all the macro tracking apps and generally like this one. I like that you can go to a meal and pick from a list of your most frequent foods logged for that meal which saves a lot of time. I wish that the brand of the food was listed in the preview. I thought that the ‚Äúcategories‚Äù of food would be from the custom foods I added and assigned to a category, but my custom food categories don‚Äôt seem to be accessible from anywhere. The foods by type and by brand are the app‚Äôs database, a lot of it is restaurant food and I don‚Äôt eat most of those things. Also, I realize this app is for tracking macros but I wish that the micro nutrients were also tracked. I also think it would be a great feature if recipes found online could be imported instead of having to do it manually.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

It‚Äôs not even close. For those who have the desire to accurately track their macros/micros this App is the best. I was so fed up by the mathematical errors and just flat out missinformation on MFP that I had to look elsewhere and I did not want to back to manual spreadsheets. Look no further! It‚Äôs worth the price for full functionality as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're getting serious about counting your macro and micro nutrients, this app is for you. You can create your own foods and/or take barcode pictures. I give 4 stars because the 'search' ability is not helpful. The search engine doesn't find food easily nor do the pre-added brands consistently match to realistic calorie counts. Overall, great app! I've been using My Macros+ for a year!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Great for managing macros if you're only focusing on total calories, fats, carbs, and protein. I would give the app 5 stars if the body weight graph would allow weekly averages instead of bi-weekly averages; reason being is that macros are better adjusted when analyzing body weight averages over 7-day periods.

                      Title: PLEASE READ!!! (Missing important components)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Doesn't track anything besides calories, carbs, sugar, fiber, fats, protein, sodium, and cholesterol. I was looking for a nutritional app with vitamins and minerals, etc. A lot of health problems develop because of nutritional deficiencies and the limited nutritional data on this app is disappointing. I intended on tracking a wide variety of nutritional aspects of my diet but am unable to with this app, in its current state. I suggest the developers to add all the nutritional data of all foods to this app. Also, I suggest possibly consulting with nutritionalists and dietitians to add accurate nutritional information on the function/importance/risk associated with various nutritional data such as vitamins, minerals, fats, protein, etc. Also, how excess and deficiencies in personal nutritional aspects may effect health. Nutrition does not just effect physical attributes but it also significantly effects emotional attributes such as depression. This app is currently a tool to track limited data but it has the potential to become an education device that could potential help people manage and understand their own complicated health/nutritional needs. This would help people track and develop their nutritional diet to improve physically AND mentally. With the solid support base this app currently has, I feel like a lot of people could benefit from these changes which is why I hope the developer reads this. Peace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was introduced to MyMacros+ about one year ago when I started tracking my food for a bodybuilding competition. Once you start using the app, you can create weight goals, micronutrient goals per day, and more! Love the interface design as it is clean and stores food favorites. You can create your own recipes and enter into the app for serving sizes and measurements. Works well when baking yummy treats and I want to know how much each serving yield for proteins, carbs, and fats. Highly recommend for anyone wanting more freedom in healthy eating and an easy-to-use app, accessible via phone and tablet and soon, computer!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

My Macros+ is a pretty amazing app, would rate 9/10 being the fact that it lacks basic information which I think should be included on the next update. For example macros being counted based on the food labeling and also better barcode scanner with a flash. I also think it's imperative that all nutrition facts are labeled down. Like potassium and vitamins are essential information logs for everyone. Proper food search with macros for various restaurants. A home dash board to view macros is a great idea to implement In an update for this app. I love it can be better great work. üòä‚ù§Ô∏èüëå

Does an amazing job at counting macros/ helping you reach your goal. Remember, this app is for counting macros, if you're looking for a nutrition log, to ensure you're taking in the correct vitamins and what not, this app will not help you much, because it is a macro counting app. If you don't know what macros are, either look them up or don't bother with this app because it'll just leave you confused.

This is the app I was looking for. There's a small learning curve, however, once get the hang of things you won't regret the purchase.

Just night the app. And EXTREMELY disappointed so far. Not a single item that the barcode scanner has scanned as accurate information! The name and brands of the food work. But calories, protein, carbs, sodium, everything is off. It was saying my turkey meat had 2 grams less protein, 30 fewer calories, and 1 carb less than actual packaging states. Very upsetting for someone trying to really make lifestyle change and can't even trust the app for accurate numbers. I hope this is fixed very soon.

It's good for simply tracking the 3 macros, which is great for what I've been doing for the last 8 months. I really like the pie chart and summaries as well. Micronutrients aren't big in this app, so if you're looking for that as well, you should go back to myfitnesspal. It would be nice if it worked with Fitbit or any activity tracker.
