                      Title: Breastfeeding
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app should include a special calorie plan for breastfeeding because if I want lose weight while breastfeeding, I canâ€™t consume only 1250 calories. Also, this app should include a calorie adjustment; supposedly if it shows 1250, I should be able to up the count to 1500 or any calorie count.
