                      Title: Almost perfect
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is the third app that I have used to count calories and it definitely exceeded my expectations, from the easy to use platform to the cool graphics and the break down of what I eat, even the free version is outstanding. The only thing, however, is that there is no option for being pregnant. I feel that this app would be over the top fantastic if there were an option on how to eat during pregnancy based on my specific body. Overall, wonderful app though.

I started using this when I was pregnant to track what I eat. My doctor had told me to be on a high protein low carb, and this app helped me keep track of everything! If you can‚Äôt find the food in the search bar you also can scan the barcode and it adds everything for you. Im still using it now after having my baby. It‚Äôs simple and great

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love that you can keep detailed list of things you eat. Not just counting a meal. It let's you pick every item on your plate and counts the calories for you. I do wish it had a pregnancy option on it and count just calories instead of weight management. With my problems in having I have to keep track of calories not weight. I will definitely continue to use this after I have the baby.

                      Title: Loved it, but didn't work for me :/
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Honestly, I want to give this baby 4-5 stars! I love how not only can you track food, exercise, and weight; but also water. The water section is great because it allows you to select your container size before logging giving you a better idea of how much water you consumed. I loved that you could review your macros and you could read the newest research in health. I loved the design and the usability. There was one flaw that was a deal breaker for me. I cook for my family and as such I'm typically making meals that serve 4-6. Therefore, I found it very difficult logging my food, because as far as I can tell, there is no recipe function. It has a custom food input so if you know the info for your recipes individual serving you can create it, but for me that isn't easy. I would have to log in the full recipe into meals, divide the nutritional facts that it shows down to 1 in my calculator. Then I'd delete the meal and save it in my custom foods. So much work. No thanks!! I have seen other apps where you can log the full recipe, say how much it serves and it will divide it down per serving for you. If you cook for a single person or  have no problem doing the  work then I would suggest this app because otherwise it's fantastic. If you are like me and need to be able to log full recipes,  I wouldn't recommend this.

                      Title: Pregnant and love the app, but...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

After using this app religiously for two weeks, I have to say I love almost everything about it. I'm pregnant so needed an app that would allow me to set a goal of gaining a 1/2 pound a week. Perfect! Interface is super easy, creating new food is easy, and I've found it very helpful in being mindful of what I'm eating. I'd love to sign up for the year plan, and that's where the rub comes in. I'm all about paying for premium content, and am absolutely willing to shell out $45 to get access to it for a year. But please don't "auto renew" me unless I cancel one day before! That feels like such a trick. "Oops you forgot to cancel - that will be another $45 for a year". If the content is valuable and worth it, we will agree to another year/$45. And if not, we won't. But don't try to "hook" us. Final thought - not sure why but the exercises you can select from are super strange! Like they don't have CrossFit (perhaps the most popular fitness routine today) but they bartending.  ?! Next time I bartend I will know how many calories I burned. But no Barre class, crossfit, etc. flying is in there though so if you do a lot of flying you are in luck!

--------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Title: How is this rated so highly!?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I gave this app two stars because it wasn't COMPLETELY useless.  It calculates a calorie intake goal for you based on your personal goal of losing, gaining or maintaining weight.  When you start tracking the scanner used to scan products into the app is convenient, but not necessary since I can read.  And most food products with a barcode have a nutrition label.  Everything else is a waste of time.  For foods that don't have barcodes (I make almost all of my own foods: hummus, almond milk, ketchup, etc.) you have to somehow magically know the calorie content.  Weight watchers has a search function on their app and if I were to type in hummus, for example, it would bring up a bunch of hummus types and brands and I could choose one to add to my point tracker. Even if it isn't exact, id have some options.  Also: there is a search feature on their activity tracker too.  On THIS app?  Good luck- unless you also magically know how many calories your workout session burned.

                      Title: Healthy Lifestyle
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a 35 year old mother of a 14 year old and a 5 month old. I have been using this app for about 4+ years. I love it! It makes you more aware of what your actually eating. It helps you to loose weight, maintain and change your eating habits for your health. I lost 25lbs in only a few months 4 years ago using this app. I have always been an athlete but I wasn't the best eater till using this app. I even used it while I was pregnant to make sure I ate enough. I only gained 25lbs and lost it all only a few days later. I only have a few suggestions for the Livestrong App. 1) there should be an option for pregnant and breastfeeding in profile so it changes your calorie intake 2) you should be able to share your plate to someone else's phone (like your husband) 3) there are still some workouts not in the system (ex. The shake weight). Over all I highly recommend the Livestrong App

This app is good for calorie and exercise tracking. It's very basic (which I like) and easy to use. I like that I can scan UPCs for many of the foods I eat. I used the MyPlate website a few years ago to maintain a 50-lb weight loss and am now trying to lose baby weight. Having it on my phone is awesome... so much more convenient. I miss the diary feature that the website had, though. It was a great tool to make note of any events or situations that made healthy eating and exercise more difficult that day. I would love to see a diary feature added on to this app.

I love it because you can go back and look at your nutrition like a usda food label and see where you are lacking nutrition and/ or what you need to improve in your diet.   It's an awesome app to say least!  The charts are amazing to look at your progress and since the tracking system on the iPhone the activity tracking is really cool.  Highly highly recommend!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

So many use this app as a way to help lose their baby weight, I just wish that they would factor into my calorie intake that I am nursing and need more to sustain supply. So many moms would find it helpful even with a community group for mothers and breastfeeding moms. Can we all hop on the ban wagon already?!

I've been using this app for about 3 years and it's ever evolving and so helpful in meeting your macro goals! I also would like to see a setting for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers to help us meet our goals as well...not sure if they can figure out a good measure of additional calories for us but it would be really awesome!

I wish this took into account breastfeeding. I exclusively breastfeed and burn loads of calories, but I'm constantly hungry and need to eat the "right" foods to keep up my supply. It would be nice if this app could take that into account when helping me define my nutrition and weight loss goals.
