                      Title: Great tool
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently moved over from using MyFitnessPal, to me the UI is just not friendly. On top of that got tired of getting marketing emails, even after asking to be removed from their list on several occasions. Went ahead bit the bullet and moved to the premium subscription, figured it would entice me to stay on track. Lose-it is easy when it comes to inputting data with a pretty good database. The insights section has already helped me to see trends that have helped me adjust my daily intake of sodium, carbs and fat. It’s fairly easy to create your own recipes, hav not tried any of their recipes, but many look interesting. Integration with Apple’s  heart kit is seamless and being to get a quick look on the watch is also a plus. Had an initial issue with the new Snap-it feature, but it turned out to be user issue. Put a ticket in and they responded within a few minutes to address my question. Would recommend this app to anyone that is truly interested in keeping track of their diet, daily food intake and exercise in one easy to use app.

                      Title: Back to Lose It but Premium Needs Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was with Lose It years ago and loved the app because it tracked my weight and allowed me to log my foods and exercises. I stopped using it cause I just stopped with my diet. Years later, I'm back with Lose It, one of my favorite apps. As a free user, it was annoying to see all these cool options but that you had to be premium, such as see how your nutrition affects you and see foods under 500 calories. You could google suggested foods but as premium, it's convenient to see them organized into under 300, 500 calories and suggested weekly meals to lose weight. The content is packed in a way I can understand it. For $2.99, it's not bad to have all the premium functions. But one thing I'm disappointed about is the nutrition, i was expecting to see something like if you eat too much sodium it raises your blood pressure, but all it's done is show me pie charts of carbs, protein and the 3rd item. It's no different from what you can view as a free user. Also lastly, everybody who's reading who made it this far, your Lose It profile is default so anyone or Facebook friends could see how much you weigh, what you're eating and how much effort you're putting in. I set mine to private and I didn't connect to Facebook.

                      Title: Weight Loss Made Simple!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

My whole family is on WW so I jumped on board. However, I quickly discovered that WW does not work for people who are whole food plant based because of their ridiculous zero point food list. Almost all fruits and veggies are on it, but so are beans, which are super high in calories! Beans and legumes are one of the healthiest things we can put in our bodies. Anyway, I started assigning points (1 per 60 calories) to beans and I started losing weight. Then I realized I was PAYING WW and having to do their job for them! I did a bunch of research and found Lose It! and it has been amazing. Two months now and so easy to use! Same bar scanner and food database tools as WW, same ability to add my own recipes (a must for WFPB people), and even does a better job of tracking weight, exercise and patterns! I love this app so much. Weight loss is about calories. Period. Counting calories used to be a pain but this app makes it so easy and even fun while helping you learn how to eat healthy for a lifetime. Two big thumbs up! Why are people paying for WW?!

                      Title: I am very impressed with this app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I highly recommend this app. Using look and feel common to many iPhone apps, this program really does make it easy to log your calories, exercise, cholesterol, sodium, and other important items. As you log and watch what you eat, you see the results and why they happen. It reinforces a healthy lifestyle and teaches you the actual truth about bad foods and habits, all at once. I am a very busy lawyer, father of 2 and caregiver to an elder, and I have no time for this. Yet I was able to incorporate logging into my life using this program. I have never successfully done it before. The program crashed a couple of times but no data was lost and it popped right back up. I doubt it was this app that crashed as I have this happen from time to time anyway. If you want to be on a lifetime eating and exercise program rather than a freakish temporary diet, get this app and learn to love your iPhone. I am down 8 pounds in the first couple of weeks and looking forward to using this until I reach my desired weight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I would like the ability to add other goals or tracking items like keeping track of meds and vitamins, and maybe desserts and alcohol, too (empty calories). Also, info for the new person that includes the number of grams and calories in each of protein, carbs and fat. Recommendations for ranges based on gender and goals (lose or maintain) because I expect some people meet their goals but continue to use the app to keep on track. Lastly, examples of healthy foods in lists by each macro, that tell you what a healthy portion of any one food would equal in grams/calories. I have found this info on the internet but it would be nice to have this info in one place.

                      Title: Week one down
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I stepped on the scale a week ago and could have cried with how much weight I had gained since leaving my profession as a Correctional Officer.  I hit a low point in my life in April 2018 and turned to food as a comfort.  I gained a stupid amount of weight in a very short period of time. One year ago I was avid about eating healthy and working out.  I was very disappointed with myself and how I had let myself go. I got the app August 5,2018.  I’ve only had this app a week and have went from 182 down to 175.6.  I’m using the free version.  It is extremely helpful in tracking calories and the data base of food it has on it is amazing.  I love that I can scan the barcode of what I’m eating and it comes right up! I have been doing this with very very little exercise. Some days I don’t exercise at all and I’m lucky to get 1 mile of walking in every day.  My body does feel drained from the sudden switch to lower calories and carbs, but that is to be expected. I love this app!

After briefly trying 2 or 3 other apps that were awkward to use, I have embraced Lose It! since my decision to get serious about nutrition, fitness, and optimal health in April of 2016. I set personal parameters for daily protein, sodium, cholesterol, fiber, and sugar intake. Lose It! makes it very easy to regularly track everything including exercise on a daily basis. Also love the encouraging messages and support along the way.

                      Title: Diagnosed with Non-Alcholic Fatty Liver Disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have used this Ap for years now, on and off but never on Premium until this diagnosis.  Being diagnosed with NAFLD was an eye opener.  I needed to lose weight, track water intake, calories and track sodium.  I can do all of that on Lose It.  My Doctor even asked if I had heard of the Ap.  I can go to any restaurant and find the food in the Ap, scan barcodes of what I am cooking.  There is a great area for socializing with other Lose It users.  You can join groups and challenges people really support each other on here. I tried the other well known Ap for tracking and it’s just not as easy to use nor does it have all the foods Lose It does. Thank you Lose It!  I’m down 15 lbs in the three weeks since diagnosis!  It’s a drop in the bucket to my goal of 100 lbs.  The Ap says by my April 28 birthday I will be down 50 lbs!  I’m looking forward to 47!

I’ve tried this app, NOOM and WW.  This is the only one that a)tells you how many calories you are eating, b) provides challenges and community support if you need it and c) gives you positive feedback on the foods you choose and highlights patterns in your diet.  The food database is also quite large and it provides macros (carbs, fat, protein) and micro nutrients as well if you are trying to up your intake of potassium or lower sodium.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been using this app for years! Love it.  Every once in awhile, I’ll switch to a new or different app just to make sure I’m not missing anything and I always come back to Lose It! This app is simple and makes it really easy to track your food intake and exercise and track against your weight goals. The more you use it, the easier it becomes to log your foods, as you can pull from previous meals and foods once you’ve logged them. I use the paid version so I can plan for my meals ahead of time and ensure I am staying within calorie limits. I have lost lots of weight with this app and also use it to maintain my weight. If you use this app diligently and stick to the goals, log your foods, you will lose weight. Period.

I used this app continuously for 4 years and I loved it. The interface is friendly, adding food and editing foods is simple but over the years I’ve found I’m quite low on iron. I wanted to start tracking how much iron I consumed a day so I could donate blood but I noticed the app doesn’t have this feature. I thought maybe I couldn’t find it and asked support where it was. They told me tracking Iron wasn’t on the app but would be considered in the future.

                      Title: Fat vs Saturated Fat and Micronutrients Would Make it 5 Star
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a great app! It is the best I’ve found so far. It is easy to use and has many useful features. Their database of foods is very comprehensive and includes organic as well as conventional brands. The ability to read bar codes is simply awesome!  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the daily totals (goals) do not distinguish between Fat and Saturated Fat. This would be an easy change to the app, as the data for each is reported when foods are logged, but it is not included in goals or the summary of the daily report.  This is very important to many of us watching our health. Also, an update with micronutrients shown in the daily totals would be wonderful, especially the major ones like Calcium, Vitamin D and other key vitamins.

I’m very happy with this app. I’ve had to look up how to do things by asking Siri and it was taken directly to where I need to go to get the information. But most recently I had an issue and feel like I went the right direction to get the answer but no one got back to me. This one upsets me that something I look at every day. Am I screamed per food I don’t see the words anymore sodium cholesterol carbohydrates sugars and fats. . . I’d like to see those but I can’t seem to fix that. They used to be there and they are there on my husbands.  At least I would like someone to get back to me. Considering I put in a comment or order in for help I would think someone would be back to me. That’s my only complaint, otherwise I love this app and I love everything about it!

                      Title: I’ve lost 70 pounds thanks to this app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

18 months ago I had a heart attack at 48. I knew I had to lose weight, get my pre-diabetes under control and watch my cholesterol, fat and sodium intake. Lose It gave me an easy, powerful — and even fun — tool to track my food. Within 6 months, I lost 70 pounds. My A1C went from 7.5 to 4.5, and my blood pressure is normal. My biggest concern afterwards was keeping the weight off, but again Lose It gave me the tools to create a daily balanced diet that helped me maintain for the last year - including helping me track how much exercise I needed. I’ve strongly recommended the app to many friends who also struggle with their weight and health issues.

I really like this app—it’s easy to use and I like the desktop version as well. I have tried a few different trackers and decided to come back to LoseIt as it has been the easiest to use. Unfortunately I just now notice where Premium is lacking. I am in my menopausal years and I would really like to be able to track my calcium intake as well as Iron. Many of the other trackers have this option and it’s kind of surprising LoseIt does not include the option under “Create New Goal”.  Please consider adding more nutritional information.  I would like to stay with LoseIt but will likely change back to another tracker if I can’t track some of the vital nutrients/minerals that I need. Thank you!

I have been using this app for about a month now. This is great not only for counting calories, but more importantly for really looking at your overall nutrition as a whole. Once you get used to it it is really quick to log in your food. If you like looking at data and charts you will love this! There are also a lot of helpful tips for good health. The app is organized very well. The search engine for food nutrition is excellent. The only thing I wish It did have is the ability to track specific vitamins and minerals in your diet, such as magnesium or vitamin B 12. Well worth the 20 bucks a year!

When I tried to ‘cut back’ without tracking, surprise, I wasn’t successful. Later, I wanted to be able to plan meals a day in advance and also set goals for cholesterol and sodium. I upgraded to paid version and now depend on it. I’ve lost 20 lbs in 5 months and still looking to lose another 10. There’s no magic - eat less, exercise more. Lose it helps keep track as easily as possible.

Your design is so much easier to use than MyFitnessPal. I’ve been with LoseIt for 3 years now however I’m in school studying nutrition now and had to download other apps to compare. I have realized that the LoseIt app needs a few updates. Especially when it comes to athletes and bodybuilders looking to calculate macros rather than just users seeking to track food. The part where the app lacks is in the food area for supplements with the micro-nutrients/vitamins. The sustainabody app would be a good app to take note of for future updates. I’ll continue to stay with LoseIt but I hope to see some updates when it comes to supplements and micros.

I have been reading the labels on almost everything I’ve bought now and I am blown away at the amount of junk I thought was healthy but actually isn’t!  Highly recommend you try this app—but don’t solely rely on it of course.

I’ve been using the app for a week now and so far so good. Before starting this my last of many diets to lose weight, I researched to find out just exactly what constitutes healthy eating, ie, what should I eat, what should I never eat and how much to eat. I set goals, rate of weight loss, calories, ratio of calories to protein to fat, never to exceed limits on saturated fat, sugar,  cholesterol and sodium and also exceed limit on fiber. Then I started looking for an app that would monitor my goals. After two failed attempts, I found this app that totally meets all my requirements.

I am in the process of comparing MyFitnessPal and Lose-It to see which would work best for me.  After a few days it is still a toss-up.  I prefer Lose-It’s simplicity and good integration with Apple Watch but I miss the more complete summarizing of nutrients that MyFitnessPal provides.  I like having the simple view in MFP showing how I’m doing in nutrients vs my goals. I can dig for the information in Lose-It (premium) but the simple reports focus on calories, fat and protein. I would really like being able to see sodium and others as well. (Including on the watch). That would make it a no-brainer 5*

                      Title: More complicated than it should be
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This works great for tracking calories and logging food. My biggest gripe is with the weight log. There are too many steps to go through to see how much weight I've lost over time. The button to see my weight over different periods of time is difficult to get to. I can never find the button to edit my goal weight. And the app tracks weight loss from the highest weight and didn't take into account the "yo-yo effect" that many dieters experience. So it tells my I lost x amount of weight but this is inaccurate, because my weight ballooned over the holidays. I hope the weight tracking gets streamlined.

I recently had heart failure and was put on a sodium and fluid-restricted diet. I’ve tried tracking my food in the past and hated having to look up everything. My sister’s endocrinologist had recommended using the Lose It! app, so we tried it and I quickly upgraded to lifetime! It’s encyclopaedic in scope. It’s made me very successful at tracking all nutritional values and fluid and weight and sleep and exercise! I’ve recommended it to all my friends! It’s always available on my cellphone. I love it! And my cardiologists (two) are proud of my progress!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I used Lose It! twice or three times over a period of years and each time lost the weight that I had aimed to. Then, as happens with every diet, I stopped, and promptly though gradually began gaining the weight back. Over two years ago, I decided that I would not stop ever. I would set a goal, reach it, and maintain it. As a result, I not only reached my goal but exceeded it. In sum, I lost 30 pounds when I only knew that I was 10 overweight. I would never stop now. I maintain a steady weight and will keep it there as long as there is this app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Love how the app auto calculates your macros throughout the day as you enter your daily meals/foods.   Balancing percentages of macros (fats, carbs, protein) throughout your day keeps you on track and is important for health. - too many fats?  too many carbs?  not enough protein?   See it all at a glance, make corrections throughout your day. Oops! Too many carbs - let’s boost the protein. Besides tracking your macros there is so much more - it’s up to you what you want to track - sugar? sodium? It’s all there.   Highly recommend!!

This is easy just for the “log your food”aspect of the app, log your exercise, water intake, etc.  it’s a fun app because it also has that macronutrient tab that shows on a graph ur fat to protein to carb ratio.  It also has Has a tab to show cholesterol and sodium, fiber.  I’ve upgraded to premium.  I have linked the iwatch and so it gives u mire calories when it registers or if u log ur exercise.  Personally can’t eat the extra unless I wanted to do a fast food,  but point is for lifestyle change, not diet:)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I used Lose It for a while, and I lost a pretty good amount of weight however, as of now, I think the quality of it worsened. Part of it is because now you have to PAY to see your macronutrients when before, you could look at them without buying premium. Just saying, that for me was something essential that I used. I don’t have the money to be paying premium. Now I can’t even tell how much sodium or carbs or any of my intakes are anymore because they decided to make it a part of premium. Sorry. Lose It used to be good for basic necessities until it decided that to unlock essential stuff like macronutrients needs to be apart of premium👎

I’ve used this app for about 2 years. Tracking what I eat has been indispensable for making well-informed eating decisions. If all you need to do is lose weight, then this is a great app. The interface is intuitive and well designed. Having access to food databases makes entering food easy. HOWEVER I found I needed to track some basic nutrients and the app doesn’t have that function. I switched to another highly rated app which accesses the same databases and but also tracks basic nutrients like calcium, fiber, vitamins, etc.

This app has helped speed up my process, and within a month and a half, I dropped 15lbs.   It has really helped me maintain peak weight loss, and I imagine it would be a big benefit to any diet plan, or its own diet plan.

First of all, I got an email one day with a receipt for $40 for a subscription to premium features that I don’t even know about. I’ve only used the app to track my food, I have no clue what I’d get charged for. I also don’t like how it doesn’t assist you in setting nutrition goals. Myfitnesspal will tell you daily sodium and cholesterol, etc goals and this app just has you set the goal yourself. I think there should be recommended goals to help someone go off of. I’m not a nutritionist, I have no idea what number I should try to stay under for each category.

I have the paid version, and I think that Lose It! is just an average app, but probably still better than some of its competitors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Lose It combined with intermittent fasting and exercise helped me lose 42 lbs in just over six months. Just do your best to enter all of your meals, water, and exercise. Careful not to intake more calories than you burn, and you’ll lose all the weight you want. Slowly manually lower your calorie budget goal over time to get over the periods when you plateau. Good luck!

I use Chronometer to track all the same things LoseIt tracks PLUS micro and macro nutrients. If LoseIt could also have a nutrient tracking feature, it would be even better. What LoseIt has that Chronometer doesn’t have is the achievement badges, as well as the social aspects, such as the ability to form competitive goal focused teams.

To keep it off it’s important to adopt a change in lifestyle- exercising more, cut out sweets, saturated fats, lower sodium intake, which required eating at home more often. This program has helped in keeping me on track.

I sort of regret going premium.  This app does not support integration with apple health to track all nutrients and vitamins as other apps do.  It tracks the main nutrition like fat carbs and protein.  Hoping they can update the app to integrate all nutritional values including vitamins.  If I’m taking time to log my food I want a full breakdown of my intake.  Until they are able to integrate this feature then it will not be worth the money. If they never update and add this feature I guess I just wasted my money.

Some insights not too helpful but does help me to think about why I might have lost more weight.  Actually I think I’m going to go to 4 stars now that I think about it.

LoseIt is integral To my fitness regimen and it’s not too strong a statement to say I couldn’t maintain my weight without it. Would love an option for friends to see and copy each other’s meals. Also, showing iron as a nutrient to track would be good. These are quibbles.

                      Title: Way better than other apps
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is amazing even using the free version, and the fee for premium is far less than other apps. It’s basically the cost of going out to dinner once or twice, for an entire year. USE THE PREMIUM. I didn’t think it would be worth the functionality, but bought it anyway to support the app since I’m getting so much use out of it. The premium functions will reveal key information to you. For example, my highest contributor to saturated fat by far was an occasional slice of reduced fat swiss cheese (yikes lol). I was getting way too much sodium from using tuna as a regular protein source. Baby carrots are my best source of fiber, by far better than any whole grain items lol. I thought mini candy canes were no big deal occasionally because of the low calories, but they managed to top the list for simple carbs...and I didn’t even eat very many of them! It’s amazing to see this charted out for you, and allows for simple changes to what you’re eating for big gains to your health. The free version of the app is great as well, extremely easy to use, nice clean uncluttered interface, and easy to chart your calories and macronutrients. Tells you how many calories you have left for the day. Easy to re-enter foods that you eat a lot, since they will pop up at the top of the list in the same quantity as last time (but you can adjust quantity quickly as well). Doesn’t constantly give you annoying pop-ups recommending premium upgrade like some other apps. I definitely recommend using this, it’s really worth the small amount of time it takes to enter the foods you’re eating. You might think you know everything about your diet, but you’ll probably find some new info using this app.

                      Title: Disappointed
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was using the free version and was happy with it.  Decided to splurge and subscribe to track micronutrients.  Come to find out that they don’t track Calcium and sugar is lumped together (naturally occurring and added).  Plus I don’t see any up side to have the subscription.  98% you get in the free app.
