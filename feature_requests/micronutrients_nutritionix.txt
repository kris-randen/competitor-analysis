                      Title: A True Lifesaver
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is a real gem for those who must track their diet due to a medical condition.  The vast database of foods and menu items is indispensable when trying to eat healthy “on the road”.  I’ve lost 20 lbs ( 9 kg ) in 4 months!!!  Additionally, it has helped to bring cholesterol, sodium and blood sugar under control.  My physicians have been completely blown away and asked for details so they can share with other patients.  BRAVO!

                      Title: Easy to use
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been using this app for 4 months now but have years of experience with other food trackers. I originally started using this to get aggregate sodium levels which this app does beautifully. Most of the detailed data comes from their database and you can see all of macronutrients and micronutrients by single food, by meal or by day with ease. You can add custom foods or build recipes as needed. The app does a good job of making your most frequently tracked items easy to find.

I HAD to give this 5 stars it is by far the bery best compared all others I used. PLUS LOVE LOVE LOVE verbal entries. I am at the computer all day and tired of typing into my fitness pal or other apps. I do so much better to track food and exercise. ONLY ask for two little thing from developers —- 1.  Make the Freeform - the Microphone easier to find - I still can’t find it to enter exercise. Would love you to partner with Dr. D’Adamo and his Blood Type - I follow his eating for Blood type O. I enter Paleo which is the closest but would be grateful for the connection to Blood Type Lifestyle. Dr. D is Tech savvy and has his tracker - but woul love to connect Swami with this!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m a doctor who was trying to follow the advice I give my patients related to tracking sodium intake daily- I was not even following my own advice! I was enlightened when I began nutritionex about how much improvement I needed in my own dietary intake. By tracking what I ate and slowly making improvements I ate better and lost weight - most importantly I was able to get to a healthier place. I don’t endorse products but I share how tracking helped me with my patients and colleagues- and this has helped them too! Great easy product to use!

I’ve been searching for an easy to use, thorough and fun app to use to keep me on track with nutrition, exercise, and water intake. I cannot believe how complete and user friendly Nutritionix is !! It has an extensive database of foods, their nutritional breakdown and micronutrients if you’re into that. I’m primarily concerned with calories, protein, complex carbs and fat. You can easily log your daily meal plans and voila!, you get an accurate and easy to understand our graph, nutritional summary. I cannot tell enough people about this app... Thank you!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s easy to find an app to track protein, fats and calories. It’s hard to find one that will track sodium at the granular level like this app does. The barcode reader makes it very easy to enter purchased foods. I make my own salsa so I’ve added a recipe and can call that up at any time. The graphs and charts almost make controlling my sodium fun. Almost. But I have to do it and this is a great tool.

                      Title: Terrible if you’re interested primarily in nutrition
--------------------------------------------------------------------

MyNetDiary is way better if you care about correct nutrition intake. This app does not count nutrition from branded foods! Almost everything I eat including packaged organic fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables are from Trader Joe’s. If I scan that in or use existing entries, none of those nutrients are counted! Also if I scan in vitamins, they are not on file and I submitted photos but they are branded vitamins obviously so they probably won’t count either. What is the point of scanning in products if it doesn’t count the nutrients? It only counts the nutrients in generic foods, not from anything you scan in. Even MyFitnessPal counts basic nutrients from scanned foods. Also it added 1% alcohol to my total macros when I had nothing even resembling alcohol! Makes me doubt the whole app. I will definitely stick to NyNetDiary which has a better UI and fantastic nutrition tracking of like 30 nutrients and counts vitamin supplements!

This app is exactly what I was looking for!  It's so easy to use.  Almost every item I scan is in their system and if not, it gives you the option to add it yourself.  I love that you can see your daily average intake in a pie diagram, as well as percentage. A couple of things would be nice. I'd like to see a weekly average of where I'm at with carbs, carbs broken down (if that's possible), protein, fat, and sodium.  Sodium intake is so important. But, just the way this app stands, it beats all the others I've tried.  :)

I’m of ethnic heritage and grew up eating home cooked from scratch meals. This tracker allows me to enter my recipes. I was later in life diagnosed with a couple of medical conditions which restricted my diet. This tracker is great at monitor my micronutrients in addition to all the usual ones. The bar code scanner option allows me to scan my foods quickly and and easily. I can also speak my food items. If there is a food that is not in their database, it asks to take a picture of front and back, submit it, and the item is added within a day or two. This tracker has enabled me to loose weight and stay healthy. It’s highly customizable. I can not speak high enough about this tracker. Best tracker/companion for food and health!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

My husband and I track all of our food on paper, and we are pretty close to this app as far as calories go because we have a food scale and weigh everything we put in our mouth. But what we did not have was the percentage of fat, protein and carbs daily. Found it by accident at the bottom of the page where you track your food, and was pleasantly surprised at all the micronutrients they list and have your daily numbers there, impressive! Once we had our main foods in the system it’s pretty easy to add or move from one meal to another. Also love how it calculates your BMR for you. Another feature we love is being able to snap a photo of the bar code and it pulls up the nutritional info with a picture. And if it’s not in their database, they ask you to help them add it by simply taking a few pictures of front and nutrition label, and in 3 days they will try to have it in their database. If you are serious about loosing weight and getting a better grip on your nutrition, this app is GREAT!

                      Title: This an excellent app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm updating my review because the one problem I had has been solved.  This app makes it very easy to track caloric intake and see where you are at any time. I love that; it's just what I needed and it keeps me on track.  I also really like the cumulative stats to see how you're doing and how the weight loss progresses over a period of time.  The bar code scanning feature is incredibly handy and that, along with the recipe builder and the custom food feature makes it possible to accurately track everything you're eating.  The cumulative dietary information is an added bonus. I'm a vegetarian and this makes tracking my protein intake simple as well. All in all, this is a terrific and very useful app. Thank you to the developers.
