                      Title: Not Great
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I bought the premium version because I thought it would be friendlier and more helpful than apps like myfitnesspal. Its not very smart, it doesn’t have a lot of foods in its database, and the recipes provided are few and not impressive. There’s no way to find easy meals, it seems to be time consuming and not super appetizing. For example, a suggested recipe to me was a tomato and buttermilk shake?? While that might not be hard to make, it sounds disgusting. Most of these recipes seem to be more about looks and “instagram” quality than nutrition and simplicity, which is what most people loom to food trackers for. In the app’s attempt to be more millenial-geared and well-rounded, they made a complicated app with a few flashy features (choosing your type of diet, taking a picture of your food to log it-which didn’t work when I tried-, and recipes-which have limited options and seem complicated). I wish they offered a trial of the premium but I understand why they don’t because I definitely wouldn’t have bought premium if I knew that not much would change, and the additional features are less than satisfactory. I absolutely regret purchasing this.

                      Title: Very Inaccurate
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I like the idea of it but it’s completely inaccurate for a lot of things. Even though I scanned the exact items I was using to try to make it more accurate, it was saying my bread had half the protein and double the calories is really has, then for my plant milk says it has 27 grams of protein instead of 10? Very confusing and completely wrong. It also gave a better rating to my vegan Caesar dressing than HALF of a small avocado and celery.. Also I put that my food preference was vegan and every single meal suggestion it gave me wasn’t even vegetarian, they were all meat? It’s also inaccurate for the amount of protein you need, it shows that I’m low in protein because it says I need just under 100 grams a day which is literally double what I need for my weight? I feel like I can’t trust it at all and it’s honestly annoying how even when you scan the item it doesn’t pull up the correct nutrition facts and the ratings are so off. Like Caesar dressing is really healthier than celery and avocado.. definitely not a good app. Disappointed.

                      Title: Love the app, but the bugs ruin it!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I really love the concept and aesthetics of this app- enough that I switched from MyFitnessPal as a long-time user. Problem is, more than half the time I go to search a food to add it to my meal or create a recipe, the search turns up blank. There’s no error message, just no results. And I’m usually searching simple things like “Apple” or “almond milk.”

                      Title: More features
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I normally do not write reviews, but I figured I would add some commentary/suggestions and also what I have found that I do like at this point. The app is pretty easy to use, has a decently large database of foods you can search/scan and can be motivating. However, I would LOVE if there was a breastfeeding/pregnancy feature. Pregnant people are meant to GAIN weight and apps like this definitely don’t encourage that, even if it’s necessary for a developing fetus. While breastfeeding, you also can’t lose weight too quickly or else you risk completely tanking your milk supply. I’ve tried to use the suggested amount of calories but every time I do that, I notice the amount of milk I produce plummets quite quickly.

                      Title: Food database needs work
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love the interface of this app. It is so great for tracking based on whatever way of eating you prefer. However, the food data base is a mess. First, the scanner functionality works about 50% of the time; and second, the food database is SO difficult to use. Users have entered information and, instead of correctly entering serving sizes, have entered unreliable data which makes it incredibly hard to track with accuracy. I wish this app’s interface and My Fitness Pal’s food database could have a baby.

I really appreciate this app, and how easy it is to use. My main complaint or suggestion would be to add a setting for those who are currently pregnant (or breastfeeding). In that situation, tracking your meals is still be hugely important, but your goals, acceptable weight, and intake of certain things will naturally be different.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I would like to personalize my plan a little more or maybe have more options. I am a breastfeeding mom which means I need to consume 500 extra calories a day. I’m sure the people who created the app just don’t know a lot about post partum dieting so I probably should have kept looking for something else. I regret purchasing the three months.

Calorie count, fat count, protein count, carb count... nearly twice a day I add a food to my diary and the counts are all off. Milk doesn’t have 30 grams of sugar. The conversions are not calculating correctly either. This was such a waste of money and there is no way to get a refund. If the developers spent more time on getting accurate information and less time on looking pretty they would make a real difference, otherwise this is just a sham. Really disappointed.

This is an awesome app but I would love if it could be modified to include pregnancy and breastfeeding somehow. On average that burns around 200 calories per day and requires extra hydration also. Currently I just have to remember to add 200 calories to my daily allowance, which then shows me as over on calories for the day.

This is by far the worst intro I’ve ever had to an app. All I wanted to do was download an app to log my lunch.

I deleted the app before even getting to the point of logging a single meal. Maybe let people try what you have to offer before you milk them for cash...

A lot of calorie information in the database is incorrect. For example, under whole milk, a cup has 21 calories and a tablespoon has 308 calories. Makes me doubt everything in the database. I don’t always have a barcode to scan so the search results need to be accurate and they are not.

I didn’t realize this was a UK app. I can’t find the names of typical foods and you can’t adjust the portions as you can in many apps. If a standard meat portion in this app is 3oz you can’t adjust to 4oz as you can in many other apps. Unfortunately I paid for 3 months but it’s fairly useless for me. Hard to track things like milk with 1% milk and 1 sugar etc.

I'm not a very self motivated person, I'm not driven for health or weight loss and I don't know why but it's hard for me (probably because prior to this point in my life I was naturally slim). Anyway, this app has been amazing for me, I took the test to see what diet would fit my needs and found that Keto-light was a fit. After reading up on it, I decided to give it a go. It grades my meals and tells me what to do to improve my food choices, helps me find recipes and able to save my own, I have been using the app for a little over 2 months and have lost 15lbs. This was with no extra exercise, just diet! I'm also a breastfeeding mom and I appreciate that it allows me to add to my calorie allowance to account for the extra that I need.

This is the first thing I have found that actually works AND is convenient enough to use without it seeming like a hassle. It's motivating and it's helping. Three days in and I am already down four pounds. Great app- I paid for the gold version (subscription) and it is worth every cent. :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app. I've tried other nutrition apps and this one is my fav. I used this one while I was pregnant to set goals to gain weight, ensure I was eating the calories and nutrition my baby needed, and now an using it to track weightloss. I've only used the free version, but have used it for about 2yrs. I highly reccomend this one!

I've always been pretty active, but I'm awful at keeping track of what I consume. This app had literally everything that I've eaten including the specific brand of protein powder and milk that I consume! Love this app, keep up the good work fellas.

Lifesum has helped me so much with getting back on track. It's very helpful with tracking my food and made me more aware of what I'm feeding my body. I found this app very useful in helping me get fit again. It's a definite must have app.

I switched for myfitness pal to this app. I've only had about two weeks, and so far I really like it! Considering upgrading to Gold but concerned. I've seen some good reviews and bad about gold. I'm a single mom, in nursing school; so while 2.99/month isn't much, it is if it is wasted!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Useless unless you bring measuring tools everywhere you go. Default serving sizes are completely impractical. Doesn't group together extremely common things like cereal and milk.

                      Title: App for single or couple, not family friendly
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Downloaded the app to help me lose some weight, break some bad eating habits and eat healthier. While the app itself is beautiful and makes tracking easy, the recipes and meal plans are unattainable for me to prepare as a homeschooling mom of 5. It would be nice to have meals that are not so out there too (tomato buttermilk smoothie?). Unfortunately I paid for a year subscription and wish I would’ve not wasted 30.99.
