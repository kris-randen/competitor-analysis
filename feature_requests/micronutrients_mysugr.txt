                      Title: Everything you need for diabetes management
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fantastic app! Only improvement I would suggest is the ability to create and track custom fields. For instance, there's a field to track carbohydrates, but not protein or sodium. The meter provided at the higher service level is accurate and easy to use. The included test strips are a great deal. I love being able to see my meals, glucose trends over time, plus an estimated A1C. All awesome features.

                      Title: MySugr
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I like the app, it‚Äôs simple to use and is quick to add an entry.  For enhancements I would like the ability to add a note to the entry I made for items that are out of the norm and connect to my Fitbit where I‚Äôm tracking my calories in/out and physical activities.  I‚Äôd also like to be able to use the microphone to make entries especially when I forget a few days in a row, that part is time consuming when you have 15 entries to make.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Tracks almost everything I need. Works well with Apple health. Only missing things are pulse & blood 02 level. I can‚Äôt find a way to add medications to the original list I made. Not show stoppers but would be great if I could. Wish list items: would be great to track grams of sugar, sodium & fat with meals. ability to get EKG & Blood Pressure data directly from Kardia app.

I started using this during a period of time where I was transitioning between doctors and I started slacking on taking care of myself. I‚Äôve never consistently tested my blood sugar more frequently and have good numbers than when I use this app! I highly recommend for anyone (I‚Äôm type 1).

                      Title: Nice stable app
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Nice stable app for recording sugars and medications and viewing trends. The ‚Äúslaying the monster‚Äù approach is used as a lighthearted incentive (and you can turn off the audio when you tire of it). The free version is definitely useful. The subscription version might be nice if you have a meter that syncs data with mySugr covered by your health plan (mine doesn‚Äôt). There are some extra features available in the subscription version (e.g., photos of meals and extra event categories/rationale), which also enable you to ‚Äúearn‚Äù more points to slay the monster.  My largest negative/frustration is the way it defines the minimum number of results for calculating HA1c estimates. My insurance only pays for 3 finger sticks a day (for type II), so even if I have months of data recorded, mySugr will often state it has insufficient data. Most people will visit a doctor during the day, so there will always be a partial day of data (for me that is less than 3 sticks). It does not make sense that it will provide me an estimate of HA1c at 11:59pm, but won‚Äôt at 12:01am (2 minutes later), although it has the same amount of data. Based on responses to help tickets, this is currently considered a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù rather than a bug. Technically, this would appear to be an easy fix [e.g., using 24 hr periods (rather than ‚Äúdays‚Äù) or calculating using the previous full day]. I‚Äôm guessing that changing the calculation might require a recertification cost, since it is certified as a medical device, so maybe we will see an improvement in later?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love this app. It's takes the monotony of the logbook and makes it fun. I wish I hadn't missed the period to get the full version for free because unfortunately it is very expensive for the pro version. But I love this app and I would recommend it to my T1d friends.

It's not a bad app, just not what I am looking for. Simply need log, chart, weight info area to add in. Maybe some food interaction, but mostly, simply "LOG" then output to email or print.. I can seriously probably do this with Microsoft excel sheet, but I'm sorta lazy..
