--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is one of my favorite pregnancy apps for tracking the baby‚Äôs progress. I like how you can also put in doctors appointments, track weight, BP, etc. The daily reminders for prenatal vitamins helps if you‚Äôre the sort of person who might forget.

                      Title: This is THE app to use!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I downloaded another popular app when I became  pregnant and quickly got burned out on it - it was all advertisements and fashion advice. I downloaded Ovia and WOW am I glad I was still in the 1st trimester when I found it. The interface is user friendly, the content is truly about my health and the health of my baby, not about what other people think or what I should be wearing. I love being encouraged to log my food and vitamins, and have truly been eating more intentional foods since starting it. It‚Äôs encouraging, informative, and my husband even got to subscribe to the daily emails! It helps him feel involved and he has been following the recommendations for nutrition by going to the grocery store for me without me even having to ask- the app is telling him what we need! Love this app! The only function I wish it had was an option for a more detailed food log, and the ability to list more specific high-risk categories that aren‚Äôt preloaded. I‚Äôm high risk with a connective tissue and joint hyper mobility disorder but there‚Äôs currently no option to record it as it‚Äôs uncommon.

                      Title: Great App but Update Left Something to be Desired
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have really enjoyed using this app for my first pregnancy! I like the week by week articles, the fun themes, and the tools like the symptom checker and food/medication safety. However, there are a couple things I would improve. Since the last app update, it's harder to look up and find medications to record. In the previous version, it would keep your recently used meds (like prenatal vitamins) up at the top so you could easily find them. Now I have to search prenatal vitamins every time which is frustrating. Also, the kick counter was moved off the front data screen and moved into the more tab, which doesn't seem to fit for me. That is something I use everyday and data that I would like to be able to chart out (it's a higher priority for me than the activity tracker). Overall, the app is great and I do recommend it to my friends. Just a couple things that I would change to improve ease of use.

                      Title: Easy, basic, and I loved it my whole pregnancy!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôd been using the Ovia app for my period for years, so when I got pregnant I switched to the pregnancy app. It was so simple to use, and I loved the familiarity of the app having come from using their fertility app. The simplicity I think is what I really liked, simple but certainly enough! I loved the little images to show how big baby is compared to your hand or a seed per say. The little feet, it was a nice touch. I didn‚Äôt use the kick counter tbh because once I could feel my daughter kick, she basically never stopped moving. She was kicking so much it just didn‚Äôt make sense to try and record it all üòÖ. But anyways if you need the kick counter it works super great, and there‚Äôs all sorts of supportive and informational articles through the app that I appreciated. It helped me get my breast pump as well which was fantastic. Highly recommend!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I used the regular Ovia app not to track ovulation but only to track when I had my periods so I would know when it was coming, and understand when my moods would change during the cycle. When I marked I was pregnant (we weren‚Äôt really planning it but took a chance and it happens on the first try üò≥), the app brought me to the ovia pregnancy app. I loaded it and found that it was even more fun and cute than the regular app. You can decide your background colors, post your picture, nickname your baby a fun name, even choose if you want the app to show you the size of your baby in bakery food references or fruit references, or some other reference. I like it. It give you info daily also about the growth and development of the baby.

This app has been like a caring companion to me throughout my pregnancy. The style is kept light and friendly and is inviting. The interface is easy to use even though there are so many options. I love the ability to track daily stuff like emotions & symptoms in addition to food intake. I love seeing updates of baby‚Äôs size and a summary of what to expect each week.  The most impressive part has been the ‚Äúhealth coach‚Äù that periodically sends a message about general pregnancy topics but then actually talks to me when I reply back and offers advice on any questions. It‚Äôs hard to believe this is a free app! So many wonderful features that have been a great help and comfort through my pregnancy. Thanks Ovia for this good service you offer!

                      Title: Doesn‚Äôt take into account diseases
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyperemesis is a condition that affects about 1-2% of pregnant women. Common, but rare. And every day the app shames HGers by asking us if we are taking our prenatal. Trust us, we‚Äôd love to take a prenatal and do pregnancy yoga and love the life, but taking a prenatal generally makes us vomit our stomach contents. Brushing our teeth, walking through a grocery store, daily life is already hard enough. We feel bad we can‚Äôt take the prenatal vitamin (which isn‚Äôt as necessary to baby health as NUTRITIONAL FOOD is, says the American Pregnancy Association.) But even knowing that we have HG, because the app asks, it still shames us every time we open it, we can‚Äôt use it without it being like the nagging parent going ‚Äúyou really need to take a prenatal.‚Äù I would, if I could, if it didn‚Äôt make me vomit everywhere. Thanks, Ovia, for shaming pregnant women when you‚Äôre aware already of their disability during pregnancy.

                      Title: Too many insurance plugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I used this app for my last pregnancy(3 years ago) and loved it, so I was quick to download it again when we found out we were pregnant a second time. However, this time there seems to be less information about the pregnancy and fetal development, but significantly more plugs for connecting the app through your employer for insurance information. I understand how that could be helpful to some but not to all of us (we have Tricare for the military insurance and it won‚Äôt even recognize it). It seems like every-other article on my feed is a promo for how Ovia and your insurance can work together to improve your app experience, which ironically is taking away from mine. Not sure I‚Äôll be using this as my primary app for this pregnancy, unfortunately.

                      Title: On point!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

As I go through my pregnancy, from the very beginning this app has been spot on! From the growth (compared to my OBGYN appts.) to what I‚Äôm feeling and the progress. My family loves getting the weekly updates and it‚Äôs so easy to screen shot the home page with your update and weeks. It‚Äôs so cute to see the tiny baby hands and feet as they grow to what a newborns ‚Äúaverage‚Äù size comparison would be at birth. So tiny and sweet! Easy to log daily and check off that you are taking your pre-natal vitamin each day! I used the Ovia ovulation before this and was just as good, as we can tell - I‚Äôm pregnant! My husband and I are so excited for our first bundle of joy! Thanks Ovia!

I really enjoy using this app. It‚Äôs really help me keep track of all the items I need to for my pregnancy. I wish that there was more options for someone having twins. I was only able to identify that I was having one child. In addition to keeping track of all the items that you eat it would be really helpful if it were identified as percents of protein or percent of iron and such as to how many cups of something I need to eat. Maybe this is already integrated into the app but I did not see that anywhere so I‚Äôm continuously trying to find that online and asking questions online.

This app has been well worth the download. I started out with Ovia fertility which really helped pin point when my periods were (not a person that ever tracked) to my bbt, weight etc. loved it! So when I found out I was pregnant, it seemed clear to me to download ovia pregnancy also. It‚Äôs kept my dates clear on when I had appts. to little notes about random things. One of my favorite features of this app is the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù where you can ask questions and read other peoples questions with quick responses And vote on them. It‚Äôs fun, interesting and also helpful.

                      Title: Absolutely Perfect.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

After my first missed period I knew I was pregnant. My sister told me about Ovia because she had used it for her last pregnancy. So I downloaded and it was so informative about every step of the way. Unfortunately I was not able to get to the doctor until 4months so Ovia was my only source of information of what was happening. When I finally was able to be seen, Ovia was right on the money with just how far along I was and even had the exact due date! I highly recommend this app to anyone who‚Äôs pregnant especially new mothers who want a lot of insight on what‚Äôs going on and things they should be doing.

I really enjoy this app compared to when I was pregnant 7 years ago when I would have to look at the internet and search all over for info each week of pregnancy. This app has good info for each week and it has been so fun to be able to see what size my baby is each week and that you can choose the theme of what you want them to compare the size of your child to. This app is also very helpful because it reminds you to take prenatal vitamins and there is a place to put in all of the info/stats for each appointment do you can see your progression. I love this app!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I like this app, but until I recently reached out to support I was not aware that you couldn‚Äôt export the information you log in the app to print if needed. This is a huge issue for me and is a huge downfall to this app, it is a must have and I hope someone adds this option soon soon. Also, without the export method, there‚Äôs no way that I‚Äôve found to ‚Äúsearch‚Äù the calendar where you‚Äôve logged notes which means I have to go through every day I‚Äôve logged and find what I‚Äôm looking for. Again had I known, I would of logged these in another app that does support these functions. I do love how they send you daily info and reminders to take vitamins though.

                      Title: Good overall
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I‚Äôm mostly enjoying this app, with a couple of exceptions. I don‚Äôt really appreciate the constant questions about whether I took my prenatal vitamin or not, nor do I like some of the other fairly invasive questioning.  This may just be annoying to me personally, who knows? I‚Äôve also noticed that since I mentioned that I have experienced anxiety in the past, there is a huge focus on mental heath on my feed- I get including info on that once in awhile, but it‚Äôs excessive at times. Finally, occasionally I cannot locate the daily info about my baby‚Äôs development- it won‚Äôt show up until a day later, which seems like a glitch.

I used Ovia as my period tracker, and the regular app helped me identify my fertile window when we were trying to conceive. Now I‚Äôm 37 weeks pregnant, and I love using the Ovia pregnancy app. I love tracking my symptoms daily and being able to add little notes everyday, and that my data syncs to my Apple health app. I also love that the app creates graphs of my weight gain and blood pressure over the weeks. I read the weekly updates in addition to the free BabyCenter and What to Expect apps‚Äô updates. The anonymous community is also a major and unique plus of this app! I would recommend this app to all pregnant women!

This app provides everything you need! It enables you to keep track of your nutrition, vitamins, doctors appointments and even has little reminders. I love how there are quick little articles on everything from where to buy a reasonable crib to how to deal with morning sickness. I also used the weekly nutritional tips based on baby‚Äôs development. This is my 3rd baby and I still learned a lot through this app. Great for first time moms and those who are more experienced. There is also a setting for if you‚Äôre having multiples as well! All in all 5 stars!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

After I quit using the depo shot as birth control (highly recommend avoiding depo) I didn‚Äôt have a period for around 8 months. When my periods did start they were so irregular and were hard to track. Ovia made it so easy to track them until the regulated back out. Then when I got pregnant the pregnancy tracker was full of details about baby, my body, tips, healthy recipes, etc. The parenting app helped keep track of milestones my baby should be hitting. Overall I highly recommend these apps and have used them for all three of my pregnancies.

Not going to lie I deleted this app because I became a first time mom and wanted some support and help. I had the Ovia period tracker and loved being able to talk to other women who were concerned about irregular periods and such. They were kind and understanding. However, once I fell pregnant I switched to the pregnancy version and couldn‚Äôt believe how nasty the women are! I would make posts about my concerns and struggles and in return I got bashed for being ‚Äústupid‚Äù and that I needed to ‚Äúget over‚Äù what I was going though. I hate losing faith in humanity but apps like these make it super easy to happen. Download the app if you want tips on where you are in your pregnancy but stay away from the know-it-all parents.

I used the other Ovia app tracking my period and trying to conceive. I love how easy it is to use Ovia Pregnancy, and the plethora of information contained in the articles. I‚Äôm heavily disappointed how centered it is on breast feeding and natural delivery. Not every woman has those as options - me for example. No app out there that I‚Äôve tried reflects on formula, c-sections, or any other anomalies that anatomy can cause during pregnancy. That being said, the drawings and variety of themes make the app so easy to customize and relate to your growing baby.

App is great with telling you what's up with baby and what you might be experiencing. The personalizations are fun.

Yes, yes I am. Stop it. Lol. Finally, add Reproductive Endocrinologist to the types of doctors we see.

I was taking my vitamin every day just fine on my own, why are you just now annoying me with this when I‚Äôm already halfway through the pregnancy. I keep trying to find a way to disable it!

                      Title: Easy to Use!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have tried several pregnancy apps throughout my pregnancy and Ovia is by far my favorite. It is easy to use, provides reminders to take vitamins daily, and provides insightful information daily. Other apps only seem to update the reading materials weekly, which is fine, but I really enjoyed being able to learn more about my baby‚Äôs development and my pregnancy every day.

                      Title: Great But...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Why does the app think that all women‚Äôs bodies work like machines?  We do not ALL ovulate exactly 12 days after the first day of our last period, so why is it when I put in the date I know I ovulated (based on test strips) it changes the first day of my last period? Any time I change one it automatically changes the other. It‚Äôs probably the pregnancy hormones talking, but treating women‚Äôs bodies like they all work like little identical clocks really irritates me.

It is very informative, and is great for tracking our progress.

The app itself is very informative. It has a prenatal vitamin reminder that I desperately need. There‚Äôs a community posting board of you have questions or need to talk to other moms. The only issue I have isn‚Äôt really with the app itself, there‚Äôs a lot of moms who reply to the post and they are down right hateful sometimes. They talk down to the poster etc. Maybe an improvement would be to have all responses approved before being posted.

So glad this is free!

One week she‚Äôs a cauliflower: so when I‚Äôm in the market I‚Äôm looking to gauge my baby‚Äôs size, then the next week she‚Äôs a pineapple. That‚Äôs inconsistent and confusing.

I ovulated late in my cycle which caused me to be 2 weeks off on my due date. My ultrasound dating confirmed the actual pregnancy age. I tried to update this on the app to reflect my doctor determined due date and date of conception but the app confined to make its own adjustments. It made my period a week later, due date a week earlier, etc and so on. Very frustrating especially when I know when my period started that month but the ovulation was just off. I will be finding a new app that is not so restrictive on dates.

Also there is really no discussion / community area.  It is just polls which are not very helpful.  I would look elsewhere

It‚Äôs a great app except in the baby development section, about 2/3 of the time they use the pronouns she/her and the other 1/3 they use he/him. It‚Äôs just very inconsistent and I feel like they could use gender neutral pronouns until a gender is plugged into the app. This is definitely an area that needs improvement.
