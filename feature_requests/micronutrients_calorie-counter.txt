                      Title: Easy to use; would like to see micronutrient information
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I haven’t used a lot of other food tracking apps, but I’ve really enjoyed how easy it is to use FatSecret (e.g. they list your most recently and more frequently eaten foods so you can quickly add them to your food diary). They are also responsive via email, which is really nice. Three things I really want to see: (1) a tally of all the vitamins and minerals we’ve had for the day, (2) the ability to drop a whole list of food into a recipe (like some other websites) instead of having to add ingredients one by one, and (3) the ability to add ingredients to a recipe without having to create a recipe (e.g. without always having to add steps, a description, etc. since I often make the same recipe, but tweak it & also since many of us prepare our meals instead of buying pre-packaged meals)

                      Title: Suggestion
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Love the app, but have a suggestion and there wasn't an option for sending one in the app. It would be nice if we could put the time of our meals in. So you can set reminders for eating, water, or vitamins. Just setting a reminder time isn't enough because schedules change. Your wakeup time and subsequent breakfast may vary from day to day, as mine does. So setting the same reminder schedule isn't sufficient. This way you'll know when you last ate and can remind yourself to eat again at whatever duration works for you. I need to eat every 3-4 hrs or I binge. But I'll get busy and totally forget for 6, then it's a recipe for disaster. Or I don't consume all of my prepped food for the day, which is just as bad.

I really appreciate the focus on protein/fat/carbs and micronutrients as well. I really appreciate that you can fully customize all of those individual pieces! Not to mention the community of people posting is so encouraging! I’m still amazed that many positive people can be connecting on an app without some Negative Nancy’s. It’s easy to use once you figure it out. (Is there a video somewhere we could watch that shows you how to access all the various features? I couldn’t find the diet calendar that shows calories in/out for awhile). All I wish we could do is scan barcodes!

I use this app regularly. Today I would like to pitch it in my backyard pond. It is made for people who buy items at the store and use them in recipes. I have congestive heart failure, so I Keep sodium intake to less than 2000mg per day. I have entered many recipes over the years. One of them is for breakfast sausage. I wanted to use this sausage in another recipe, but could not because it is a recipe not a food. I had to enter it as a food before I could use it in another recipe. Why not just pull my recipes over as foods so I don’t have to do double entry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is a great tool to track weight loss.  The only downside is that if you are on a specific diet that requires you to calculate off the nutrition label, it doesn’t automatically do it for you. Because app users have the ability to download pics,  share stories, and comment, it creates a supportive environment to motivate each other. I highly recommend this app to anyone who is looking for an easy way to track their weight loss progress and is serious about achieving their goal!

This a good app to log calories and see how much your daily food intake distributes across fat, carbs, and protein. It’s assisting in making better food choices. I wish it would break out saturated fat, sodium, and sugar on the summary page. If you want to get a meal plan then it costs but, overall, I think it’s a good app. Better than many others I have tried including weight watchers and noom.

Also it would be nice to be able to customize some things you track for example I would like to track the amount of iron I eat. But other than that this is a great app.

I used another calorie counter app prior to trying out this one.  Now this is the only one I use.  It's much easier and intuitive and the barcode scanning feature makes it a snap to enter foods.  It's one of my most used apps.  By the way, missed this app a LOT during the temporary period where it was crashing.  The 2.0.1 version seems to have brought things back to normal.

Syncs with the website, iPad, and igoogle. Extensive, easy-to-add-to database. The barcode scanner is sheer genius. Can customize tracking for dietary needs (like sodium or fiber rather than only fat, kCal, carbs.) Tracks calories out. Easily adjustable daily calories-in target. I cannot think of a feature it needs to add, and the interface is wonderful. And it's FREE. I would pay $5-10 for this, easily.

Thanks to developer for making this application! I love how they set up and it's so easy. Before I go out to meet my friends last mins plan. I can look it up quickly on restaurant fast food chain i.e. " Chili's " and knew what I will be ordering for my dinner. It's very useful and help to cut down on bad fat stuff such as sodium killer and others hidden secret that we don't know. This is highly recommended.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I use this app in conjunction with the website to track calories and activity. It's useful and the large food database and ability to add foods to it are very much appreciated. It needs a way to sync data between the app and website and from one day to the next on the app without having to close the app and reopen it. That would make me change this to a 5 star review. UPDATE 11/9/2020: They have tweaked the app. It’s more user friendly and the layout is easier to work with. And it syncs now! Still the absolute best food database IMO. They have made it easy to update nutritional information. I used to have to use the website periodically to do certain things the app couldn’t do, but now I am able to use the app 99% of the time. It never crashes or acts weird. I’m able to easily track micronutrients as well as macros, which is invaluable in keeping my sodium intake, and therefore my blood pressure, in check. And it works! You must be diligent and weigh/measure when necessary and be honest! The app literally shows you what works and what doesn’t. I am 61 and quarantine wasn’t kind to me weight wise. With this app I have lost 14 pounds since June! Be diligent, be honest, and with this wonderful app, anyone can lose weight.

My doctor, perhaps being something of a Luddite, asked me to bring a paper record of meals (and glucose readings) to help my diabetes control. Assuming that “There must be an app” for that, I tried 3 or 4 apps that I though might work. Most didn’t offer any export/print capability, at all; one  required a subscription before that ability was enabled, but did at least have a 30 day trial period. So I signed up, and I was very disappointed to see that they only exported meal totals, not including the foods, and no  charts or report output.

Without being able to look up nutrition info based on restaurant names, brands, or bar code (which the app makes easy), I'm sure I'd never bother. The weight tracker is also great. (I wish I could view the weight graph and a calorie graph simultaneously.)
