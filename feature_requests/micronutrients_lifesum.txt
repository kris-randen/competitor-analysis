                      Title: Awful navigation, terrible tracker
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This hets 2 stars instead of 1 because i do actually use it to track, mostly because there’s little better out there. But the rest of the app is total garbage. It is inaccurate and poorly sourced, confusing to navigate if you want to change your plan, and the nutritional meals are extremely confusing. First, it only allows you to choose one dietary choice. For example, i try and eat a low carb diet but i ALSO want to keep that diet by eating clean and whole foods. But i have to choose one or the other. I am a pescatarian, and for some reason I still get recipes that suggest chicken or other meat. Also the “nutritional tracker” is literally never happy—you could have the healthiest meal and it will say you are nutritionally off track because you didn’t hit *exactly* the nutritional intake it demands to the exact gram. If you have baked salmon, an extremely healthy food with lean protein and omega 3’s it says the meal is “too high in fat,” the same as if you had pizza. It doesn’t differentiate between good fats and bad. There’s no pleasing the nutritional tracker. It is annoying to search for recipes, and it seems like just a way for celebrity fitness influencers to make even more money when this could be an actual social app for real users to share recipes, exercises, and fitness data. What a waste.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve tried loose it and my fitness pal. I went ahead and went premium for this one so I can see grams of protein. Like the other apps, data for food isn’t 100% accurate but it’s good enough. Also like other apps, with premium you can see grams of protein, carbs, etc; but if you want to see vitamins and minerals you’re out of luck. This is the cleanest, most elegant of the tracking apps out there m. I appreciate it.

                      Title: Great App for Tracking Eating Habits
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a great app for keeping track of your eating habits. I’m using it to evaluate what food I intake, the nutritional content of those foods, and how I can eventually make better choices. HOWEVER, if you are expecting to use Apple’s Health app to sync data from Lifesum (which the app claims to do), then skip it. While Lifesum does record and sync data to Health, its consistency is not reliable at all. Data may sync to the Health app for a couple of days, but for some reason, it will skip other days entirely. But more annoyingly, on days that it decide to sync data, it will sometime not sync every category which you have selected (i.e. water intake, sodium, sugar, etc.). Additionally, the app will sometimes glitch and erase data which you have recorded INSIDE of the app itself. It’s unfortunate because I really enjoy this app and it has contributed greatly to changing some bad aspects of my eating habits. Hopefully these issues are addressed because the app is worth it.

                      Title: Life Changing
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I usually don’t write reviews, but this is literally the best app I’ve ever bought. I’m 14 and I want to lose 15 lbs in a healthy way. It gave me a 15 week period and I thought “okay that’s reasonable”, but then I started using it and it’s motivated me so much I’ve lost 6.2 lbs, it’s been 2 weeks. I honestly wouldn’t be nearly as motivated to use it if it wasn’t such an enjoyable of an experience. The design is flawless and the little icons are adorable. I love using the barcode scanner, then I don’t have to figure out if I actually ate what I logged. The life rating is really motivational, and ever since I had a day tracker for fruit and a weekly tracker for seafood, I’ve been eating lots more of those.

                      Title: MyFitnessPal is easier and more accurate
--------------------------------------------------------------------

(I’m using the premium version) While I love Lifesum because of the coaching and keeping macro and micronutrients monitored, the actual food logging needs a LOT of work. Unlike MyFitnessPal, which is the easiest food logging I’ve ever done, Lifesum is not only difficult in finding the food you’re trying to log (they don’t have the database that MFP has), but the serving sizes and entering the amount you’re eating is more often in grams instead of cups or the MUCH easier options on MyFitnessPal. A lot of the nutrition information is also wrong, meaning that I have toggle with the “amount” of food that I ate in order to get the calorie count correct. I also don’t love the often negative feedback that pops up if you occasionally eat something that’s non-nutritious. Because of this, I’ll likely be canceling my subscription at the end of the 3 months and looking back at MyFitnessPal.

                      Title: Very disappointed
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am so beyond sick of fighting with this app. If you care anything about tracking your macros correctly- go with myfitnesspal. I’m frustrated that I upgraded to premium only to hate this app so much, I dread using it. Everything I scan- has the wrong info and often times the barcode is associated with the wrong food item. So I edit each time, carefully putting in the exact info off the food packaging, only to have it tell me calories etc are wrong and not allow me to save it! Why bother?  I also hate that it won’t allow me to track other things, like vitamin content- except for potassium. Also a joke that it won’t allow you to remove food items you create, or most of all, edit them. Which is exactly why you see so many duplicate items created by ppl on here. I know I sometimes change my recipes up, so why not allow me to change it on here?  This app has been around too long to be this dysfunctional.

                      Title: Beautiful app but for targeted users only
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello, I have been a premium (paying) user of this app, but I had to cancel my membership. It’s a  beautiful user interface, which was the initial appeal for me as a user. However, without the ability to access simple data from my food intake, this app is not as useful as I would hope for it to be when tracking more than just macros. Calcium, magnesium, and so many other minerals that should be easily imported on the developer side (I am familiar with development), but somehow, even with a user forum requesting such simple tracking, and for years now, this data is not available to users. The alternative for tracking not just macros but the various minerals we need to survive and thrive is My Fitness Pal, which is free, for my purposes at least. I will happily return as a user when these simple yet essential pieces of data are shared and easily accessible as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Totally enjoying this app. I was 309lbs and couldn’t loose weight. I only started doing this app at first because I had to go on the low iodine diet for testing. I just wanted to track what I was eating. I started loosing weight on the diet and decided since I was finally loosing weight I would continue using the app.  It shows me how many calories my body needs and if I eat something that’s not acceptable I get a sad face. I’m just three weeks in and weight 277.4 pounds. I’ve done several diets in the past! This isn’t a diet, this for me is a teaching tool of how to live a better in more healthier way. FYI, I am just using the free part of the app. 👍🏻

I love this app, it makes eating healthy SO much easier and it’s super cheap to have a premium subscription (if you can afford $3 a month!), the only suggestion I have is that it would be super cool if during your evaluation you could add in certain things like “I need extra calcium” or “I’m allergic to nuts” just simple stuff like that. Having foods tailored just a little more specifically to what the individual needs would make this app absolutely perfect in my opinion. Lots of the foods I choose to eat have higher sodium because I have a sodium deficiency and as silly as it is, it makes me sad when the food rating smiley face looks disappointed in me for eating high sodium lol.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Very nice app, but I’d love to see more meal plans that are built for more variety of goals. For example, I have a metabolic rate that’s faster than normal and I struggle to keep weight. This means, when I go over the amount of calories, and the amount of carbs and fats, it’s actually considered good rather than bad; (but going over the amount of protein remains not recommended) It would be nice to see a plan that would have these things in mind. Another feature that would be nice to see in the future is nutritional values like vitamins and such that you can keep track of from the foods you eat.

                      Title: Disappointing and Subpar
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I really wanted to like this app and even got a trial of the paid version. I liked the idea of the recipes and health scale. Quite frankly, it’s underwhelming and seems like it wants to be more like MyFitnessPal or Fitbit. However, its scanning function hardly works, and a lot of the information it does have is wrong or incomplete. It also does not track vitamins and minerals, which are really important, especially if you’re dieting. You also have limited control over what information you can input for a meal or recipe. I will say that I like the faces next to individual food items, but again, this is only effective if the information attached to the food item is correct. This app has a long way to go before it can be real competition for some of the other diet and nutrition apps out there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I decided to try Lifesum after several fitness vloggers did sponsored videos about the app. The only draw of it over my fitness pal is the aesthetics. I used it daily for months and it drove me insane that it constantly crashed. I should mention that I currently have an iPhone 8 so it’s not an issue with an old phone. I don’t mean once and then it would work if you opened it again. There are just periods where it doesn’t work at all and you can open it 20 ones in a row and it will just continue to instantly close. It is insanely frustrating. Once you’ve got some of your favorite foods in the history, it’s annoying to switch to another app. So my advice is not to invest in it at all. Go with my fitness pal. Lifesum is cute but gimmicky.

WHAT A NIGHTMARE!!!! I didn’t mean to sign up for a year. And when I followed the app’s link to unsubscribe, the developer only gives you the options to renew various packages. No way to unsubscribe or cancel!!! They also automatically auto renew at the end of user package you subscribe. So if you sign up for a month or a year, at the end of that period you will be automatically renewed and charged again. I tried to cancel through Apple but as this is a 3rd party developer, Apple doesn’t have the ability to do anything. And when I went to the Lifesum website and emailed customer support, I received an automated email about 3 days later informing me to follow the unsubscribe link through the app!!!! So basically the developer has locked you into a subscription with no way of canceling.

I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max and parts of the UI are getting cut off in the corners. Also, the keyboard gets in the way when trying to enter a value for potassium in a custom food. I would also like to be able to edit the name of scanned foods because the names are either incorrect or excessively long; e.g., scanned name: “Breakfast nutriflakes cereal 40% bran flakes”, actual/shorter name: “NutriFlakes Cereal”. Being able to edit the brand would also be nice, just in case. Another feature I would like are more micronutrients to track, not just potassium.

I gave 3 stars because of the obvious amount of work that went into developing this app. It looks like a great app. Two things. More than half of the recipes I was able to view have a startling high percentage of fat—45-56%. It’s just my opinion but there shouldn’t be any recipe, let alone many recipes, on a health app or site that is that high in fat. Any kind of fat. Second is sugar, fiber, sodium and saturated fat are locked in the free version, items that are free in other food trackers. I’m all about paying developers. They deserve it. But I was surprised to see that. Otherwise I like the motivational portions and health tests.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I eat mostly animal products, because they have the most bio available and highest amounts of micronutrients compared to plant products. Protein too, because I want to be fit and plants are lower in protein by calories and amino score. Though this is basic knowledge, this app doesn’t allow you to specify you eat grass fed only and that all the meat you eat must be conventional low quality meat. Your health score is based off the amount of plants you eat and though I hit all my micronutrients almost everyday, I’m classified as “unhealthy”. Also, the biggest issue is the premium. It’s not monthly, so if you want to cancel, well there goes $40 to $80.

I find it upsetting and I think it could lead people in the wrong direction! Is there anyway to turn off the smiley+frowny faces because fruit+veggies+legumes+etc. are NOT unhealthy :)

Vanilla cod tartare?  Very limited selection.  Atkins has a free app and actually has a decent recipe selection. The only positive is seeing the breakdown of the micronutrients for protein, fat and carbs.

This app really keeps me in perspective of what I’m eating in terms of calories, carbs, fat, and protein. I eat less processed food and more fruits and veggies. The only complaint is that my recommended calorie intake is only at about 1700. That’s a bit low even for someone with a small frame like mine. I do not follow the calorie tracker to the extreme, more to keep track of my nutrients and vitamins.

This app doesn’t deserve a single star. MyFitnessPal’s free version is way better than this garbage. Lifesum doesn’t update your weight when you update it on apple health. There’s no way to customize your food diary meals setting (I like whole day instead of worrying about each meal and ONE snack) or customize the micronutrients. Why did I pay for this again?! The premium for MyFitnessPal allows you to customize so much more, even MyFitnessPal’s free version is more customizable. I want a refund. I used this app for a total of maybe four days. I hate the UI.

                      Title: This app recommends STARVATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, prospective doctor here. For people attempting to lose weight, this app recommends you undergo “two days of fasting” or the keto diet. Both of these options cut out sugar which is necessary for glycolysis, the metabolic pathway that fuels your body and synthesizes the ATP and Pyruvate that is used for Pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. All these processes keep your body alive and functioning. Eliminating glucose long term will lead to muscle deterioration and in severe cases, keto acidosis or self-canibalisation. Both are LIFE THREATENING. I suggest seeking a nutritionist who knows the bodily processes and not a trendy app that favors body image above health.

Food nutrition info is wrong for most foods I  scan. Doesn’t integrate much or at all with apple health. Diet plans are sparse and don’t include popular options. Doesn’t give detailed nutritional information on food beyond (usually wrong) Carbs/Fat/Cals/Sodium and Potasium. I should have saved my money and used a spreadsheet. I could do better myself in Excel in 4-5 hours. I seriously can’t believe they charge $9.99 a month for this.  This is a total rip off.

The app is beautifully designed but horrible when it comes to managing the subscription. I thought I cancelled during the trial period just to find out I’ve been charged $50. It took a Google search for me to figure out how to manage the subscription and there isn’t a cancel button- it’s just on auto renew! BTW I’m calling my lawyer to see if that’s even legal. I should be able to opt out at any time with the guarantee it won’t auto renew. Also, you have to pay to connect the app to your Fitbit- boooooo!

                      Title: So many great features, but can be difficult to use.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve actually enjoyed the many many features that are all bundled into this one app, and I don’t think any app can compare! However, I think there’s still some bugs and things that make it less easy to use. For one, sometimes you can scan the barcode of the food you ate (thinking it’ll be faster and easier), but then the calories that Lifesum logs are actually different from the calories on the package with the same serving size. I’m often having to jerry-rig the serving size to make it match the package because even an extra ten calories can make the app give you a frowny-face for the meal. Secondly, maybe it’s just my account specifically, but my weight is never recorded in permanence in the weight log. Everyday that I log my weight, it starts me right back off where I weighed before I started using the app, saying “wow you lost 5 pounds today!” when really I lost one pound and the other lost pounds were logged on previous days. In my calendar of weight statistics, it’s a stagnant, flat line from my goal weight for about a week and then will drop down as soon as I update it. Tomorrow, though, it’ll pretend I never logged a change yesterday and go right back to my starting weight. Lastly, I wish that the units the servings were marked in was more clear. Often “pieces” will actually mean the one serving size as mentioned on the package of the food, yet pieces makes you want to type in te NUMBER OF PIECES you ate. Like pizza rolls. “One pieces” is actually 6 pieces and 220 calories. In spite of all this, I think the app is beautiful in design and I love how many features are available. I also think that premium might not be worth it... I’m using premium now during a free month trial, and I don’t feel like it gave me a whole lot more. I don’t feel like having this premium month gave me a taste of anything I’d consider buying after my free period is over.

Now, I’m stuck between continuing the membership for the $30 something I paid for or just dealing with the fact that I wasted $30 something dollars on an app I feel like I got stuck with because a lot of the reviews claim it’s hard to get the refund. Aside from this, the app is okay.

This is the first time I've ever tracked my food or paid close attention to how many calories I'm consuming every day. I'm not trying to lose much weight.. just working to get into better shape and improve my overall health. I really like using Lifesum so far. It integrates nicely with the Apple Watch, and my suggested intake changes based on my activity throughout the day. I love that you can add your own recipes and save meals! These features, along with the ability to save favorite foods will eventually save me lots of time logging food going forward. I also find that I save time by planning my meals in advance vs. logging each meal throughout the day. I haven't tried any of their recipes yet, but it looks like they have some good ones! Suggestions for improvement: This might be too complicated, but I'd love to see some integration with Allrecipes / the ability to quickly add favorite recipes from this site. I would also like to see more nutritional data (vitamins and minerals). I feel like most of their plans are a little crazy with the suggested daily protein intake (it's usually very high). All in all, though, the only thing that's really disappointed me is that I recommended this app to my mother and after a few days it wouldn't let her use it anymore unless she upgraded to a premium membership. I was under the impression that you could still use basic features without upgrading.

This is a great app! Works much better than trying to keep a paper food journal. Love the ablity to take before and after pictures. BIG + is being able to start over and erase profile. I downloaded this a few versions back and used it for a while then kinda got off the bandwagon. Well, I am back on and it's great to be able to have a fresh start with this app. Food library is great. I did notice with this latest version when you add a food it won't let you scroll all the way down to enter sodium and fiber. Also, the custom minutes on exercise is not working quite right. Hopefully these minor bugs will be fixed so they work right again. These developers are doing a great job and I expect them to keep up the good work!

This is a great app if your are looking to gain,maintain,or lose weight it also keeps you on track to get moving when I look over the day It encourages me to do 30 or more exercise daily it helps me keep track of my water intake and let's me know how healthy I'm eating or how healthy a certain product or food I'm eating is they do offer recipes but I don't follow them exact because I personally believe everyone's intake is different but it gives you great ideas I do wish that they could show more then your carb,fat,protein intake maybe something different iron for example or Ect. although it is very helpful and Add possibly your daily fruit intake or less restriction to none paying members ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love Lifesum. I have used loseit and other trackers in the past but I really enjoy this one. I feel as though it is more accurate, it does a breakdown of everything including sugar and sodium and it lets me know if my diet is balanced or not. It tells me to eat more fish or if I need to eat more calories. It is all based on the plan you pick and there are many to choose from. It also has a water tracker that you can track either glasses or bottles. usually I will start tracking my food and then quit but with this one I stay tracking, even if I eat bad. It sends me reminders to log my meals but it doesn't hound me with notifications. Like my title states, it's my go to.

I was absolutely loving this app until about a day and a half in and when it started crashing instantly every time I open it. I've been trying for the past day to be able to get it open again but it won't. So it's awesome until it quit working. You put in your height, weight, age, your goal weight and it'll estimate how much weight you should lose over a certain period of time. It also keeps track of what you eat by entering in the name or scan the barcode and just hit The button and it'll calculate all the calories you had for that meal. It'll tell you if you've had too many or too little calories for that day and it will also keep track of how much water you drink by just tapping on a little picture of a glass.

I enjoy this app much more than myfitnesspal because you have the option to measure your food in grams which works for my lifestyle. However I would like more options and customization when it comes to setting goals and counting macros. Sometimes the diet and percentages don't match the goals Im trying to reach and would like to set my macros in grams per day. Also would like a tab to view the entire day and sum of all the macro and micro nutrients like myfitnesspal does so I know how many macros I have, or don't have left.

I love this app, because not only does it help you track your macro-nutrient requirements and caloric intake, it gives you ratings of the food you're eating. It reminds me to stay hydrated as well. You can also track your exercises and it will change your macros based on exercise. The only problem is that it doesn't have all the exercises you would do in the gym, but I usually assume all chest workouts under the "push-ups" category. Also negatively, you have to pay to be able to track all the micro-nutrients.

This app basically has everything you need in a weight loss app. Includes downloadable nutrition info from other users, calorie goals, water intake, exercise, waist measurement, body fat, and more. What might be useful would be some type of nutrient tracker as well (vitamins, minerals). I am a vegetarian and it's difficult for me to recognize which nutrients i'm lacking. But this is a weight loss tracker after all, so it's not entirely necessary, I guess.

He app is awesome and the interface I find to be much cleaner and more attractive than myfitnesspal. Premium appears to offer a bunch of neat diet plans and the app will help you see how well your meals are in line with your chosen diet. However, I don't like that you can't even track basic nutrition information like the sodium of a meal without premium. Myfitnesspal beats them on that. All in all though I like the app and will continue to use it.

                      Title: User updatable online database a good think, but a fiasco in practice; Cumbersome to add food/recipe
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Tracks water. It does not track sodium although screen shots of the upcoming version suggest that sodium will be trackable. While you can enter total fat, you cannot break out the saturated fat or trans-fatty acid numbers. It covers the other major nutritional items and gives you the daily totals of each. Foods are in categories and that works most of the time. However, why are muffins under snacks and not under breads? You can edit just about everything, and there's a trash can where you can go and undelete an item you've deleted. I can add an exercise and edit it. I can "edit" a database exercise but the only thing I can change is the name. Can edit everything about custom foods as well as database foods. When I add a new food to the database, I can't enter the nutritional information by serving as it is listed on the food label -- I have to enter it based on 1 of whatever measurement I've chosen. While on the one hand this makes sense, on the other, I now have to have a calculator so I can convert the nutritional information from the food label serving size to 1 of my measurement. That's what computers are for -- I don't want to have to have a calculator on hand when I'm doing my data entry into the app. I could enter a recipe from a cookbook that already has the nutritional values as a custom food. However, if I'm cooking a recipe that does not already have the nutritional values I have to figure it all out manually before I enter it as a custom food in this application. When I add a food to my diary, one of the categories I can select is "Brand Name" but it's empty. When I search for a brand food, for example "General Mills" nothing is found, so I have to do an online search. I saved a cereal from my online search for "Genera Mills"; *now* if I go to "Brand Name" category I see an entry. If I search for "Cheerios" on line, there are tons of entries for "Cheerios" -- all different (two different "1 cup" servings had totally different nutritional information) -- so I either have to sift through them all to find the accurate entry for my serving type or I have to create my own entry, which would then end up as still another "Cheerios" entry in the on line database, adding to the chaos. The on line database needs more brand foods and restaurant foods and once that's done, the on line database needs to be cleaned up. That would solve the problem of everyone making their own entries a la this "Cheerios" example. We cannot use this app right now because some of the nutritional items we need to track are not available. When the next version comes out and if tracking the additional nutrition items, cleanup of the online database, food entry with "per serving" data entry of nutritional values, and recipe entry with generating of nutritional values are added we'll be happy to use this app and will change the score.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I like this app, I like you can choose which plan you want, I like that it shows macros for the day. I like that it tells what is good and bad in food choices, and that it reminds me to eat fruit and fish. I paid for the premium, to get the most out of the app, but these are some things I would like to see: 1) I can edit my macros to my ideal goals. Right now my goal is kinda in the middle of being healthier/cutting fat and gaining muscle. I’m skinny, a tad muscular but have some fat to lose. My macros I like to aim are 30-50/30-40/20. 2) more choices/variety for the “how much”. It’s pretty difficult to exactly see how much I eat or drink but how I would measure it isn’t on the list so it’s difficult to track on the app. 3) recommendations for food products. If it’s saying the slice of bread I’m eating is high in sodium and is processed, show me breads that would be better choices.
