                      Title: Edit* improved
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit**** the developers heard our concerns the glitches have been fixed. Since it‚Äôs a new app there‚Äôs always room for improvement. Some exercises are missing equipment needed before it starts. For example there‚Äôs some workouts where I‚Äôve needed a mat since there‚Äôs floor stretching but it didn‚Äôt have it in the equipment needed. But it do enjoy that the model doing the exercises is the same stage of pregnancy as I am to ensure the safety of the movements.

                      Title: Excited for this app, annoyed with loading pauses
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was so excited to find this app and have purchased the premium and been using it for a week now, but in the middle of the workouts the exercise will simply stop loading and I‚Äôm sitting waiting for it while my heart rate slows and I lose the burn. At first I figured out that if I click on the next movement it will load more quickly SOMETIMES, but mainly it just glitches more.  Another day I tried to let it ‚Äúload‚Äù aka sit for 30 minutes before I even click play to begin the daily workout, but that didn‚Äôt work either. I use 5G WiFi and have no issues with slow connection in the house, I have deleted the app and re-downloaded it and re-started my phone to troubleshoot at no avail. If this one glitch would be fixed I would be happy to rate this app a 5 star! The workouts are challenging and easy to follow along, and I love being able to track my progress. I do wish I could track what I eat in the ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù but I just had to download a separate app for that. I am a single mother and a lot of the recipes do not seem budget friendly, but the recipes are listed and arranged to make them so simple! I do hope to try some of them as my pregnancy progresses. All in all it is a very cool app!!

                      Title: Repetitive exercises, not exactly designed for pregnant women
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I subscribed this app as an option for a home workout during my pregnancy and quarantine period. I added my goal of exercising 4 days a week for about 30-40min. At the beginning I noticed that the videos was always crashing, so an exercise plan of 40 minutes normally takes longer as it restart the whole exercise. The plans are pretty similar, over and over, and not only there is a slim model on the videos (not a pregnant woman on an exercise app designed for pregnant women) but also a bunch of lunges for example and other exercises not really good or comfortable for 20+ weeks pregnancy. There is a huge amount of repetitive exercises during a pla. I‚Äôm 23 weeks pregnant and it has increasing the number of lunges and other extreme exercises as well as sending longer plans (47 minutes). They offer repetitive shorter options in case you wanna reduce your time, but really, same exercises all the time! I will not continue with my subscription and I‚Äôm extremely disappointed! Do not recommend!

                      Title: Limited Variation and ability to customize
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was excited to have an app to lead me through home workouts during pregnancy especially during quarantine. At the start (in second trimester), I was enjoying the app overall. My biggest complaint was that I didn‚Äôt feel I was getting enough cardio and there is no way (so far as I can tell) to customize the workout type (eg have more  cardio routines to select from in a given week) apart from repeating a workout. As the weeks have gone on, as other reviewers have noted, it seems the exercises are just recycled ‚ÄîI‚Äôm doing the same exercises I have been, perhaps just in different order, for several weeks without any new additions mixed in. In addition, the trainer in the video barely appears pregnant so in my third trimester I‚Äôm following someone that has a lot more range of mobility etc. it seems for a pregnancy dedicated app, the very least it could do would be to film instructors at about the appropriate prenatal stage...  there is a lot of room for improvement and I don‚Äôt feel I will continue with the app beyond the initial period I‚Äôve already paid for.

                      Title: Seems Unfinished...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I, at first, fell in love with this app for the weekly circuit workouts. They were a perfect addition to walking and yoga during my pregnancy. However, there isn‚Äôt sound and they don‚Äôt include transition time in between exercises so I had to be prepared to makeup those missed reps later. Well, now in my third trimester the circuits stopped. Are they not done creating them yet? So now I‚Äôve tried using the MyFitnessStudio portion and the workout orders are not correct. Today I did a workout that went from warm-up, to cool down, and then the workout. Do the creators not test these out before they post them? Also who creates these workouts? One had a lot of bridge exercises so I was on my back for a long time and then there was reclined twists which can be unsafe. I hope they have certified instructors creating these workouts because women are trusting you. Review your own app Baby2Body so you know you are charging women for the app you are intending to give them.

                      Title: Don‚Äôt waste your time unless you want to purchase
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The only reason I‚Äôm giving three stars is because the app is gorgeous and I‚Äôm sure its great once you purchase it. I‚Äôm trying to save as much as possible before our baby comes and spending $7/mo on an app isn‚Äôt worth it for me, regardless of how good the app is. I thought the free version would at least have some functionality but it‚Äôs a total waste of time. All of the content is locked until you purchase. It would be great if this app had at least some features that made the free version worth keeping. I downloaded it and immediately deleted it unfortunately.

Becoming a mom-to-be for the very first time is an amazing roller coaster ride . The amount of apps I have downloaded for this baby are definitely in the double digits but I have deleted some of them , I kept this one around because it‚Äôs the full package ! There‚Äôs Zen breathing which I just began doing ( it really helps ) , meal and recipe ideas , and full workouts ( did one today ! üí™üèæ broke a sweat and I felt amazing ) designed to your fitness level . You get a lot for it to be a free app but you get even more with the in app purchases ! I recommend this app to anybody that‚Äôs on their way to motherhood

I also love the weekly recipes and daily bites of information. You can also log your weight and water intake too. Looking forward to continuing this even post pregnancy as well. If you download this def use it to your advantage this app has so much to offer. I wish it had an option to save workouts, that‚Äôs the only thing other than that it‚Äôs great!

                      Title: This app keeps you motivated
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This app is amazing for pregnant women feeling lost on what things to eat, which work outs are safe, and it keeps you wanting to stay on track! It‚Äôs super important to eat healthy to FEEL good. Specially in the first trimester. Which in my opinion it‚Äôs the worst time during pregnancy because hormones can really take a toll on how you feel. I feel extremely tired and sick if I don‚Äôt work out and get good foods in my body, so this app teaches you different recipes that will help you through ‚Äúmorning sickness‚Äù which is all day sickness for me.

It‚Äôs tough to dig through all the prenatal apps out there, but Baby2Body offers easy to follow video workouts that you can take with you on the go... to the gym, beach, living room, wherever. It can also be confusing as your pregnancy progresses to know what exercises are safe and accessible while still challenging. They tailor to your fitness level and desired frequency. I also love the pelvic floor exercise timer and recipe options. Worth paying for, but it‚Äôs great that they have free content available as well.

I love the zen den and visualizations if there were multiple visualization breathing exercises you could choose from per week that would be so nice. I‚Äôve been doing this to relax me after your recommended workout for the day and I absolutely love them. Thank you so much for creating such a wonderful app!!!!

This is my first pregnancy and Fitness and well-being of me and my baby is my #1 GOAL and this app is great help and reminder for my baby brain! Download this app, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!

I found this app during the last week of my second trimester. I am SO disappointed I did not find it sooner! As a very athletic woman trying to maintain fitness through pregnancy I was ecstatic to FINALLY find an app with real workouts that are challenging and yet safe to do. The advice and daily tips are absolutely wonderful compared to the outdated advice I found in other apps. Seriously, this app is worth every penny of the small cost.

My only complaint is that I can‚Äôt listen to music on my phone while following the workout. Makes working out at the gym a little boring since I enjoy working out to music. Overall, a great app with lots of yummy recipes, helpful tips, and great advice for staying emotionally, physically and mentally strong ‚ô•Ô∏è

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Love this app! Having guided exercises for each phase of my pregnancy has been really helpful and has kept me motivated. Only downside I have is some of the transitions from one exercise to another is unrealistically fast. For example when switching to an exercise that has ankle weights it doesn‚Äôt allow you time to get ready and then the pause button doesn‚Äôt actually pause the exercise so you get behind. Overall love the app and if that was fixed it would have 5 stars!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been using this app since I got pregnant and now I am in my third trimester. It has few glitches that need to be fixed specially if you are paying $10+ every month. While using the fitness studio, if you make it full screen, it looses all the time and is stuck on 34 seconds. So by the end it will show you that you have only completed 34 seconds of workout and not the actual timing. It‚Äôs kind of annoying, specially if you want to share your progress. Please look into it.

I am 5wks along, have endometriosis, Adenomyosis and pelvic floor issues. The first thing this app wanted me to do, was pelvic floor exercises. You aren‚Äôt really inclusive for high risk pregnancies and women whom have health issues. There isn‚Äôt even a place to put this information in like there is with other pregnancy apps. Within the first 30 seconds of opening this app, it wanted me to sign up for a premium membership, I haven‚Äôt even looked over the app and you already want my credit card information? I‚Äôll be deleting this app now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been using this app ever since I was pregnant and still use it 6 months after. I use to like reading the quotes at the bottom of the page which is mainly one of the reasons why I kept the app and now with the new update they took the quotes part out. I was so disappointed and still am. I guess you have to pay for that.....I didn't want to delete the app but I think I'm going to have to.

I downloaded the app and started tracking my pregnancy at about 5 weeks of pregnancy. I had a miscarriage and despite the MULTIPLE times I‚Äôve ‚Äúreported a loss‚Äù it will not stop tracking my ‚Äúpregnancy.‚Äù It‚Äôs hurtful to open the app and see that I should be at 8 weeks pregnancy now and I miscarried a week ago and the app still has not registered that I‚Äôm no longer pregnant. What am I supposed to do?! Report the ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù of my baby? Need to work this bug out ASAP.

Signed up for a free trial to see what this was like but failed to cancel in time. This app is EXPENSIVE.  I will edit that having it be a one year subscription, at over $100 a year, seems predatory to me. Options for month-to-month memberships or other models for membership would be better, as a persons ability to engage with physical activity during and after pregnancy can change significantly. I am pregnant and busy and exhausted and will now have to go through the App Store maze to figure out how to get my money back.

This app seems like a great idea, and I was thrilled to see they offered a free version. However, almost all content is locked on the free version. I made my fitness plan to include 3 workouts per week, but only the first workout was unlocked. I would have to subscribe to get the rest if the workouts. As I have a new baby, I have better things to spend my money on. I have deleted this app and will go back to using 8fit for workouts.

I was doing these workouts through week 30 of my pregnancy but after the app updated, I had to switch away to a new app. The new exercises on this app are much harder to follow, the app has glitches every time I tried to use it and the woman doing the exercises was not pregnant herself. Too bad I had to switch away because I loved the previous version of the app but this new version is just not worth the money for me.

Everything has been great except the exercises. Most of the videos are performed by a women who is clearly not pregnant or maybe barely in her first trimester. I don‚Äôt really think the developers understood what a women‚Äôs body literally cannot do in the third trimester because their stomach is so big. It‚Äôs made for some petty uncomfortable exercise.

the program and app in general is well thought out- from workouts to self care, recipes and articles for pregnancy are a good mix. the reason i‚Äôm giving it a low rating is because of the video player they use. it is very inconvenient to not be able to rewind or fast forward while working out, especially since the videos mess up so much you have to constantly close and reopen the app to get them to start playing again. if it weren‚Äôt for this huge inconvenience of interrupting the workouts, i would happily pay for this app.

So I‚Äôm 14 weeks postpartum, just found the app a week ago, and have only been using the free version so far before I commit to purchasing something. I realize there is a free trial for a week which doesn‚Äôt seem like enough time to decide if you like the app (monthly app subscription seems overpriced especially since I don‚Äôt want the kitchen or zen den part).

I was not exercising daily before pregnancy but decided I wanted to stay healthy during those 9 months. With the fatigue, hormones, strong calls for strange foods at strange times and your body changing things can become a bit overwhelming. This app helped me stay in control and balanced during my whole pregnancy. What I love about it:

Keep your $$ in your pockets. The information you gain from this app is dull compared to the apps I've mentioned above! I highly recommend OVIA or What to expect! üòÅ

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I gave 2 stars because it does give you a day countdown which I really like towards the end. However, the app wants you to subscribe for 4.99 a month to access its articles. The articles are short and not very useful or informative. There is so much information out there and so many other free baby apps that give you great articles. The 4.99 A MONTH is a joke. Other than the daily countdown this app is a waste of space.

I did 3 days of free trial and cancelled.  I have the intention of finding an app to pay for the remainder of pregnancy and postpartum.  This app is a big NO from me.  It‚Äôs incredibly slow moving and glitchy.  All the work out videos are the same movements so there isn‚Äôt a lot of variety (so why would I pay!??).  The voice that is used to describe the movements breaks-up and is so monotonous- it‚Äôs torture listening to it!  I tried to connect to Spotify to have background music playing but it plays random music that doesn‚Äôt go with the workout (it selected a Christmas song one time!!!). Also I don‚Äôt have a lot of the equipment that‚Äôs needed.  I have a yoga mat and a few lightweights- that‚Äôs it.  So it was hard to select from the very little workouts that were offered.

                      Title: On the fence
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love that this app integrates with Spotify so I can listen to my own music while I workout. I can‚Äôt figure out how to access the downloaded workouts though. They spend a lot of time on warm up and cool down, which is nice, but I wish there was a way to skip through those if I‚Äôve already warmed up before the workout. I also wish there was a ‚Äúworkout library‚Äù of sorts, where we could do supplemental workouts on the days when we are feeling good. I‚Äôm 26 weeks pregnant now and some days I feel fabulous and want to do two workouts. One last thing - for an app that‚Äôs specifically geared towards pregnant/postpartum women, it‚Äôs a little surprising that the ‚Äúinstructors‚Äù are all thin, non-pregnant people. Overall it‚Äôs not a bad app for $13 a month. Just needs a little work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Looking for pregnancy health information and healthy workouts? Don‚Äôt even waste your time downloading this app. Treat yourself to quality free workouts on YouTube and downloading a free pregnancy information app such as Baby Center. If you try this app for free- be prepared to be disappointed. There is only one workout available unless you sign up for the free 7 day trial. The free trial( of course ) leads to automatic monthly debits unless you cancel it in time. The format and information on this app are not worth the price as far as I can tell. App designers- If you really wanted folks to try an app and determine the worth of it, you don‚Äôt make them submit their credit card information to access any of the worthwhile content.

                      Title: Great app for Prego Mamas
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I really enjoy using this app! I‚Äôm currently in my 25th week of pregnancy and have been using it for over a week now. I love that the workouts fit the week of pregnancy I am in, so I know my baby and I are safe completing them. I also like that you can stream music in the background (I use Amazon) or use your Spotify playlist. The workouts are all less than 30 minutes, so I‚Äôm able to complete them in the morning before work and my toddler waking up. They use minimal equipment I have already in my basement, or it‚Äôs easily supplemented with something else. For example, I don‚Äôt have a step, so I used my stairs. I really haven‚Äôt worked out much this pregnancy, but I‚Äôm going all out for the third trimester thanks to this app. I wish I had downloaded this app sooner! There are also lots of helpful articles and recipes. It may be cool to have some kind of communication set up with the ladies using this app, like a way to connect with other moms using the app also in week 25. Just a thought. üòä Thanks!

                      Title: Love this App!
--------------------------------------------------------------------

So far, I am SO happy with this app. It‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for in my pregnancy to help encourage and motivate me to stay healthy and active. I opted to pay the money so I could use the fitness portion and I am not disappointed. I needed fairly easy and fast workouts that made me feel like I got a little workout with not too much intensity to make it hard on me in my third trimester AND shorter workouts since I‚Äôm busy running after my 2 year old at the same time. I‚Äôm a beginner when it comes to consistently working out and ‚Äúmedically‚Äù overweight for my height, so I like how simple they make it to follow along and workout in each trimester without it being too advanced to follow. I appreciated the videos portion in the fitness section and that it will link to Spotify for music to workout along to. I love all the little tips and advice and recipes. Overall- I think this is totally worth the monthly payment to add onto my yoga workouts and walking. I really enjoy it and recommend it to any of my preggo mommy friends! Thank you for this app!

I started eating healthy little at a time and used their food suggestions on this app to slowly get me back on the right track. I feel amazing and some days I‚Äôm lazy but i love the simple and short workouts. They still kick my butt and everyday I feel stronger using this app. It‚Äôs awesome.
