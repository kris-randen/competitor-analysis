Title: Mrs
----------------------------------------------------------
I absolutely love this app!! I am a trainer and a figure competitor so I count my macros year round. It took me some time to figure the app out but the more familiar I have gotten, the more short cuts I have found. (The tutorials were very helpful.) I initially liked the app but kept using fit click (on my computer) but because I was going to be traveling over seas for a few weeks ‚Äî I felt I needed to force myself to get familiar with it as I would be tracking while traveling. I am so glad I did! It has been so easy to track ‚Äî even on the road! I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this app. I find it very easy to add custom foods (which I typically do for all my food to ensure my numbers are accurate) ‚Äî even w/out using the bar code scanner. Again - I couldn‚Äôt recommend this app enough. The only thing I would like to see is a web site that we could use to track that would be linked. When I am at home, working from my computer, using a web page may be a little faster for me but overall - no complaints.

Title: My macros app
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm not much of a review guy.... BUT, I must say I am very happy with this app. I never liked its competitor(s) interface, however I found ‚Äúmy macros‚Äù to be very easy and perfect for me. The best part though, is that it has a small business vibe. There has been two occasions were my data has been lost, I‚Äôm not concerned with the why. However I‚Äôm very impressed with the how, and by how I mean how they resolved the problem. Mind you, I left the account dormant for a couple years, so it‚Äôs no surprise that updates happened or whatever else takes place in the app world. All I know, is both times I emailed, and both time Jason himself responded and found a way to correct and reload all of my saved data, much of which was manually input. SO... why?? I don‚Äôt know and I don‚Äôt care. All I know, is the app is good and nothing‚Äôs perfect, but IF there‚Äôs a problem I can count on them fixing it. And that‚Äôs all I can ask for from any professional. So thank you and yes I love and recommend this app over others.

Title: Sold app with a nice layout.
----------------------------------------------------------
I was reading the reviews and was really looking for an app I can add multiple meals per day. This you can have as many as you want. Also love how the totals are all are at the bottom of each sheet and the total at the bottom of the day. I find this really interactive and easy to use. It was a change from my fitness pal. The scanner is easy to use and better than previous app. I love the push and pop on the day. Best use of this feature on the iPhone yet. Ok. Complaints. The database is good but needs updates. Like no seared tuna, see its when eating out and trying to search for items it struggles. Also the recipe needs help. In my fitness pal this is amazing, which I still use because of it. The only feature I do miss is the integration with strava or adding workouts. But this is not a big loss. Stick with what you do best which makes this app excellent. Glad I have joined the community. Can't wait to see what is next.

Title: User friendly! Truly helpful.
----------------------------------------------------------
My favorite part about this app is the barcode scanner. It's so easy to just scan the barcodes of whatever I'm making, and then input how much I eat. It calculates all the nutritional value and I see how much I'm getting or not getting. It's helped me quite a bit since I started using it. It's harder to reach nutritional goals than you'd think, and seeing what I eat every time helps keep me accountable and aware, since I have quite the sugar/carb tooth. I also like how you can just search things or manually enter them in a simple format when you can't scan a barcode. You do have to enter each part of your meal individually, I mean even the sides or toppings. But that's not a downside to me because I see it as a more detailed breakdown of my food and I'm seeing exactly where the good calories and bad calories are coming from. Overall great app!! Worth it.

Title: Use it everyday!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using this app for over a year and with each update it gets improved. I love the barcode scanner though sometimes it doesn't recognize the barcode (hello just enter in macros from the nutrition label and it's saved!) the only critical feedback I have for the app is I wish it would calculate changes in nutritional value if you change something from grams/cup/oz/etc to another variable. It would just save time. And for carb cyclers if you could be able to enter different macro goals for the day and it would automatically change your goals for you. Sometimes I forget when my carb load day is (carb depleted brain anyone?) but if I was able to set a schedule for my macro goals it would make my life simple. However that is a stretch for any critical feedback, this app is awesome.

Title: ABOUT TIME MACRO HEAVEN, THANK YOU!
----------------------------------------------------------
A Macro app that finally doesn‚Äôt limit me!!! I can create recipes and my hubby copy it through his app being in my ‚Äúcycle‚Äù making meal planning so so much simpler! Plus we can remind each other to drink protein and tweek meals for each other to hit our goals without needing to voice it. I can just view where he is for the day on the app and vise versa. Along with being able to set custom macros for different types of days ‚Äúrest days‚Äù, ‚ÄúHITT‚Äù, and ‚ÄúPower Lifting‚Äù making it much more effective to hit training goals and effortless to switch from each setting. I also love the meal reminder. This app is SERIOUSLY the best and I‚Äôve committed to several on pro versions and lets just say none actually allow me to do what I can do on this one. It‚Äôs simple, effective, and I love it!!

Title: Fantastic Tool
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a wonderful tool for tracking your macros. The only draw backs are that sometimes it doesn't have the food your looking for so you have to create a "custom" food (but the app saves it for future use, so it's not so bad) and it doesn't track the time that you actually ate (yet you can label each meal and even create custom labels, aka snack1 or snack2). Other than those minor things I can't think of anything that I would change (well except if they started adding features that tracked weight and measurements/connected to a fitness tracker/recorded exercise/etc., yet that would  a super all-in-one app, lol). The layout is simple and easy to use. This app basically takes away all excuses for not tracking your macros!!!!! Buy it!!!!!

Title: Great macro tracker
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is the first I‚Äôve found that allows for customization of foods down to the gram. For example if I‚Äôm entering in granola instead of limiting me to a cup serving this allows to input 64 grams. This is extremely helpful especially when putting in recipes. I was a little hesitant to try this app due to some of the negative reviews but it seems like most of them have to do with this apps ability to search for foods. I find it much more to my liking to enter my own custom foods using the labels or google to find the nutrition facts so the database of this app is irrelevant to me. Another thing I love about this app is that I‚Äôm able to connect with my wife on here and we can share meals and recipes so it‚Äôs easy to track together.

----------------------------------------------------------
This app is amazing and the best for tracking macros if youre on a iifym diet. ive been using this app for the past 3 years, of course I would let loose occasionally on vacations. But once I want to get back on track, this app is my go to, iifym is a healty maintainable diet that works! A lot of other diets are fad diets. I love how this apps saves everything I put in and can customize. I also love how all my data and info is saved under my username as I had just damaged my phone and had to get it replaced, I accidentally uploaded my blank data onto the server but Jason the app creator was able to restore all my data back to me!! Lifesaver and lifechanger! Thank you for creating this amazing app! $3 is nothing to change your life!

Title: LOVE, Love, love this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've recently began a Ketogenic lifestyle & keeping track of my macros was not only tedious & time consuming but a little confusing at times!! Most "diet" app's are geared only towards counting calories. I was delighted when I came across this app AND that it was easy to use! I love the features & the ability to view graphs based on fats/proteins/carbs. The barcode scanner is a blessing. While there is a decent sized pre-added food inventory, it's very nice to add you own manually or by using the barcode scanner. The ONLY thing that gets to me is that when using the barcode scanner occasionally the nutrients are off from what the actual package says. Just a little thing! Otherwise this app is perfect for me! Thanks so much!!

Title: So many great features!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been tracking macros for the 5-6 years and used many Macro Apps in the past. I have yet to find an App that provides so many features. I enjoy being able to create my own recipes, manually log my foods, and look at each of the graphs analyzing my foods. I also like the joined My Workouts+ App. The App developers are also very professional and extremely nice when I sent an email with suggestions for copying/pasting links of websites with my favorite recipes. In addition, I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a way we can use our Smart watches, Fitbit, etc and have them sync so we have all of our information available: caloric intake vs caloric output (along with graphs that support this information). Thank you !

----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using MM+ for a little over 6 months now. I got a new phone last week, I read that I could sync my info to be on the new phone, and then I messed up and clicked then wrong button, which meant losing all of my food entries, data, etc. Safe to say, I cried but then sucked it up and said I‚Äôd just start over. Someone in a macros group on Facebook recommended I reach out through the app, and while skeptical, I did. I am SO GRATEFUL that I did!! MM+ was able to get my data from their end, and once they had it, all I had to do was sync it correctly! All of my stuff was back, and I was quite happy. I love good customer service, and MM+ definitely exceeded it! Thank you! It‚Äôs greatly appreciated.

This app is wonderful once you get used to its workflow. Loaded with functionality, including weight tracker and the ability to look up foods, I have yet to find a food that is not in this apps library. I also love how in the recipes section I don't have to input my own nutritional values for all the ingredients I just look them up individually from within the recipes menu and the app does the work for me! I also had a question about functionality and I emailed the staff using the send feedback button to ask it and I got an answer within hours on a Saturday from the co-founder of the app, who better for a functionality question?! Amazing app that's well worth the 3 dollars, keep it up!

Title: Fantastic Macros Tracker.
----------------------------------------------------------
I switched over from MFP. Iv have been using that for about a year. It always felt bloated and full of stuff I didn't want. I just wanted to keep a food log and track my macros. This app does this with ease. It is well designed and everything iv thrown at it has been in the database. If not then it's just 5-10 seconds to enter it yourself it has a clean interface and is quick and easy. I'm so glad I found this app and support it fully. Thank you to the creater. Please keep making it better. It's already a great app. One suggestion I would ask of though would be to add a + button on the main screen to use the scanner a little quicker. Besides that this app is epic.

Title: Best app ever
----------------------------------------------------------
There are some great things in this world...I can definitely say that My Macros+ is certainly at the top of the list. This is the app I have been looking for. After spending months calculating and manually adding/updating and recording macros/cals in the "notes" app, this was a breath of fresh air. It is very easy to use, efficient and extremely accurate. (I've double/triple checked many of the available listed foods and they are spot on!) I can really say this borderline changed my lift and I recommend this for anyone from someone who is "dieting" to drop a few lb's... To the serious competitive athlete or bodybuilder. Thanks for developing this!

Title: Best Macro Calculator
----------------------------------------------------------
This app I heard about from watching one of Paul Revelia's YouTube videos. I had been using MFP for years. There are mostly pros over the cons in comparison. Hitting macro totals being the primary focus here, and it is easily visible almost everywhere on the screen. It took a bit to get the hang of the format but once I did I'm able to fly through easily. One tweak to consider would be when you try to enter what you plan to eat tomorrow and the day changes, it still says tomorrow until you go back a day and it will change. This app fixes the things that annoyed me about MFP (annoying homepage and difficulty seeing macro targets vs reality).

----------------------------------------------------------
I recently got a new phone and when I downloaded the app and logged in none of my meals/food was transferred over to my new phone. The app has a sync feature that means you should be able to use multiple devices to track and I couldn‚Äôt get it to work. I emailed their support email and the problem was solved in less than 24 hours. I‚Äôm so thankful that all my data was saved and that they took care of it on a weekend no less. I also think you get so much more on this apps one time payment version than any other app I‚Äôve seen. You get way more for a one time payment of $2.99 than you do for the free version of MyFitnessPal. Love this app!!

Title: GREAT EASY TO USE APP
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app for a little over a year and couldn't be more pleased. I just add all my foods via the custom input and track my macros from there. I also love how it shows the remaining macros of each day and the percentages of each food group. It also has an awesome feature where it sends you an email at the end of each week to show what you kcal intake was for each day. The only things I would add to app is a time when I eat each meal or when you enter your info in and on the email it shows your overall kcal for the week, so I don't have to add it every time. But other than that totally recommend. Great easy to use app.

Title: Amazing app with a few bugs
----------------------------------------------------------
I love how the app functions and have zero complaints about how you use the app. I use this app and its workout tracker counter part to track all my nutrition and fitness data. The only thing is that mymacros+ doesn‚Äôt sync its nutrition data correctly with Apple health. When I go into the Apple heath app it doesn‚Äôt display the correct amounts of my macro nutrients and will display protein amounts in the 10,000g/day range. I‚Äôm running IOS 11 on an iPhone 7plus. Hopefully this gets fixed soon. It would also be cool if the myworkout+ app exported estimated calories burned data to Apple health based on age, weight, height, and body fat.

----------------------------------------------------------
This is easily the best app for those that ate serious about their nutrition & tracking their macros. The app is easy to navigate And I very user friendly. The customization with the food is awesome & being able to add your own food and have the app calculate the exact macros for whatever serving size is great. On top of that Jason has awesome customer service. I emailed him with several questions and within minutes I had responses directly from him. He answered all my questions and was great to talk to. This was literally the first app I purchased off the app store and so glad I did. Thanks Jason for the best app on the app store.

A shout out to Jason and team for saving the day. My entire database disappeared for some inexplicable reason during an iPhone update and I was devastated. It took my 4 years to build my food library and the mere thought of trying to rebuild was daunting.  Sent a message to the support team and although it took about a week to restore (they were as baffled as I) Jason and team got to the bottom of the issue and restored. Very grateful to everyone on the team for their help!  And so appreciative of how this app has evolved over the years. So user friendly and makes searching, scanning and recording a breeze!!!  Highly recommend!!!!

I love this app for tracking and love they keep improving. I do wish I could have the option to search only my custom and favorites. For some reason some foods don't seem to "save" in my custom and favorites either (or maybe I'm just not finding them). So I need to rescan (my butter for example). The longer I use the app and the more foods I add, the nicer it would be to search only my foods. Same goes for search by brand. I wish I could then select the global search or just my foods. But these are wish items. The current app functions great and is helping me change my body. Huge thanks to the creators and the team!!

Title: The Best App for Macro Tracking
----------------------------------------------------------
I started tracking my macros in August 2014. At first I tried myfitnesspal and was left feeling frustrated because the system wasn't intuitive and I couldn't figure out how to set my macro goals precisely. I then began hunting for an app on google.  I StumbleUpon MyMacros+ and loved it from the start. It's super easy to use, it remembers my favorite meals and I can seamlessly switch from a low carb day to a high day back to a low day and then to a Refeed day all with the touch of a button. You enter your different goals once, it remembers and you can toggle through them easily. I highly recommend this app!!

I read through most of the reviews and after trying my fitness pal and not really loving it, I bought this and it's so much better. if you're like me and eat relatively the same foods, this app is amazing. input foods once, and then just go to your recents to get it (or custom if it's not in recents). I do agree with others that the database has lots of entries that could be right or wrong, but you'll find the same thing with my fitness pal... and it's not that hard to look on the Internet and enter it yourself! otherwise, I love the goal tracking and the display, and everything is so seamless. love it!

It has made me become more aware of my eating habits. I've been calculating macros with this app for weeks now. Went from 115 to 104 (keep in mind I am 4'10) it is WAY better than my fitness pal. They want a monthly membership to be able to do the things this app does for a one time fee. It's so easy to cook in bulk too. Go to recipes, put in all the ingredients weight you're adding, then weigh everything together at the end and plug that in in the serving area. Awesome app. I can keep on going on the features.

Man this app is so awesome it's unreal!!! So easy to track each and every single thing you eat and you can save meals that you eat frequently. Like I eat the same breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack and post workout Monday thru Friday and I just save each one of those meals and you just click on it and it uploads the whole meal!! Takes 2 seconds to enter a whole day. And it's all super accurate. I'm down 4lbs in 1 week and without knowing exactly what I'm putting in my body everyday thru this app, I wouldn't have been able to do that!! Highly recommend this app, beats the heck outta my fitness pal.

Title: The best!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is the best, hands down. The only thing you need to do to make this app successful and 100% accurate is to make your own entries for everything, which is honestly what you should be doing on ANY nutrition app (looking at you MFP users). The database entries aren‚Äôt going to be correct, neither is the barcode scanner. But once you get the hang of making your own entry it takes less than a minute. I‚Äôve been using this app for 8 months and have lost almost 30 pounds. Make your own entries, get a kitchen scale, weigh in grams (not tablespoons and cups), stick to it, and enjoy results!

Title: Needs Measuring Algorithms
----------------------------------------------------------
Great potential, but this app is in desperate need of food measuring algorithms. I measure my drinks in ounces or cups and my food in grams or ounces, however, if I wanted to pour only 6 ounces of almond milk, this app doesn't allow me to quickly and practically do that. I have to stop and think "how many ounces in a cup?" (This is just an example, I know it's 8) and then I have to divide 8 by 6 and am left with a really weird number to input into the app. There needs to be a quick menu to change from ounces, to cups, to whatever. See MyFitnessPal. Their calculation algorithms are great!

Love this app, before this I used myfitnesspal which is not as good as My Macros. The fitnesspal app wants (for premium) 10$ a month or 50$ a year. With Macros you get premium for a one time payment. Looking back I now would have gladly payed more than 3$ the UI is easy to use and after a week or so of use all your regular foods are there and makes things quick and easy. If you are new to or have been doing IIFYM this app will help you be accurate and will be easier to use than the under armour app with tons of ads (myfitnesspal). Also try pairing this app with the workout one as well!

I've been counting macros for two years now with other apps, shifting how I enter and track to fit the app's limitations. Never again! MyMacro+ let me set up different macro-goals for different days, it gives me very quick synching between my phone, iPad, Mac and PC, and so far I have not had any trouble with any platform I use. The barcode reader works well, and there are lots of helps to make you think your most frequent or favorite food and meals quick and adapt other entries as best for you. Go for it - and just do the upgrade right away, you get A LOT for a very small cost.

I have struggled with tracking my meals in the last because it seemed to always put me in an unhealthy mindset which would lead to skipping meals and trying to eat as few calories as possible.  However, MM+ has been a godsend.  It doesn't focus on calories but macros instead which has helped me tremendously.  The food library is fairly comprehensive and I find it very easy to track my meals.  MM+ is a simple but effective tool for macro tracking and is well worth the small fee, especially when compared to apps like MFP that requires a $10/month subscription for macro tracking

I have had this app for a while but I am just beginning to really appreciate how powerful it really is. Everything that I have needed to track that I could not track before in other apps I can do it here. I can add custom recipes, rename them, put them on a different day, add notes to them, and get a meal reminder. I can even add custom meal names so that I really know what I‚Äôm tracking instead of trying to force it to fit in standard categories like other apps.  What more can a girl ask for?  Now if I could just have this app to do my cardio for me I would be all setüòÑ!

Title: So much better than MFP
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app! It‚Äôs better than my fitness pal since there are no ads, stories, and you get to decide the exact gram for your macros. It‚Äôs organized by macros and if I track a food I won‚Äôt eat again or was a one off I can delete it off my recents making it easier to find my foods that I use all the time. I like how you can convert the measurements and how it‚Äôs so simple. I think it would be cool to add fun things to do with your macros like carb cycling or reverse dieting. The coach is an option but I really just like doing my macros on my own! It‚Äôs a great app!!!

Title: An excellent app for tracking macros!
----------------------------------------------------------
For what I need a calorie tracker to do, this is better than MyFitnessPal. Primarily, because it is less expensive and doesn't require the subscription for basic things like the ability to have multiple daily goals - which is necessary if you're carb cycling, or doing something like LeanGains. And, the developer listens to what the community needs. The one thing I found lacking was an ability to choose a different nutrition goal before making a food entry; I wrote the developer about it - now, it has that ability. (I'm sure it was requested by others, as well.)

Title: Great app! Very simple and practical
----------------------------------------------------------
The way this app is set up is perfect, it keeps your goal and current macros on display and even counts down how much you have left every day. It also synchronizes with avatar nutrition accounts which makes using those macro numbers 10x's easier. Some certain branded foods can be a little difficult to find in the search, but you will at least get something similar. Entering in the food measurements is very easy, instead of having to enter grams in multiples of 100 like other tracking apps, you can enter in the precise number and go as high as you want.

Title: Amazing app. Best macro/food tracking app
----------------------------------------------------------
It's accurate and does everything you want it to do. Used my net diary and my fitness pal and this app is 10 times better. I'm a personal trainer and this is the app I recommend to all my clients. It makes it easy for me to check up on their weight as well as make sure they are hitting their macros. Great for people like me who do IIFYM/flexible dieting. I never review apps, but this one is well worth my time to review! Also if you have issues or suggestion, the developer responds quickly, as he is always looking for ways to improve his app.

Title: Takes time to get used to but worth it.
----------------------------------------------------------
I came from mfp and at first it was annoying not having such a diverse data bank. Then I realized you don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs right unless you enter it yourself anyway. So I gave it two weeks and started entering my foods and now I could never go back. No more guessing which entry is the best because it‚Äôs myyy entry. This app really forces you to do that but it‚Äôs a good thing. Then the way everything is laid out is much more intuitive and easy to read. No more going to a different page to see how much more protein I should eat. Love this app.

Title: Excellent App
----------------------------------------------------------
This is one of the best macros tracking apps available. It takes some time the first week to get used to tracking, but it holds you accountable for the food you eat! I love how it keeps store of frequent meals making things a lot easier after the first week.  Turns out my problem was I wasn't eating enough food!! My performance in the gym and my energy level has increased tremendously. My advice is to stick with it. It's hard to figure out meals that fit your macros initially, but once you get the hang of it the results are worth it!

----------------------------------------------------------
I got lucky and picked this app first. I put in my info and goals, followed the allowances for protein, carbs, and fat daily, and lost weight...simple.  My only wish is that you could have more than one user and be able to track multiple people. I have not seen that this is possible. I need to help my husband with weight loss and be able to track us both on my device. I have downloaded many other apps for his tracking and have been disappointed with the free versions  after using this one for myself. This one is by far the BEST!

Title: I've always preferred MM+ to MFP
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using mm+ for over a year now and I'm still in love with it. It's much more customizable than mfp. It's very organized & easy to read. You can be as precise with your units as you want & it does a great job at making conversions for you. You can create & name endless macro goals/splits... Which is especially useful for athletes who are constantly changing macro ratios. With more people using the app, there are now more pre-tracked food options in the "search". Save your favorite meals, most tracked foods, recipes etc.

----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app!  It makes it easy to track my macros, weight, and water.    I wish it were easier to input exercise into the app other than syncing with myworkout+.  I find myworkout harder to track exercise and I don't use it regularly.  If the app could sync with the iPhone exercise tracker, that would be ideal or find a way to simply input exercise (broad categories like cardio, weight training, etc. and level) to give you a better idea of calories burned everyday.  Other than that-this app is awesome!  Absolutely love it!

I‚Äôve been using this app for macro tracking for about a year and a half nowand really like it. Straightforward, no fuss, macros only. I know lots of people that like MyFitnessPal and I tried that out for a while, only to switch back to this because it‚Äôs just so easy. Only minor complaint is that the list of foods in the database isn‚Äôt as comprehensive, but once I‚Äôve gotten my regular and favorite items entered in I use those all the time from my favorites list. I recommend this app if you are looking for an easy way to track.

Title: Great
----------------------------------------------------------
The App is My favorite, but I see 2 problems that I want to know if it is possible to solves as faster as possible please. One of this problems is that the Kcal of what do you register, in the days goals...There is always bad calculated the Kcal compared to the macronutrients, it count less calories that it should count. The other observation is that when you set a goal, you should personalize it; I mean the amount of fiber, sugar, unsaturated fats etc. Please check this points; but apart of these points, the app is awesome.

Title: Great Macros Tracker
----------------------------------------------------------
Following a Keto plan, I prefer to see my information displayed as a 'graph' and not just in grams and ounces. My Macros does this easily. Other apps and trackers are ok but want you to subscribe to a monthly service for the same features My Macros gives with one, affordable purchase. Customer Service is exemplary as well. I had a question and sent an email. I was contacted within an hour with a solution. Great customer service alone is worth the cost of the app. I highly suggest this app. Thanks My Macros (Jason Loewy) :)

----------------------------------------------------------
This is by far the easiest macro/calorie tracking app I've ever used. It is easy to enter data, the barcode scanner recognizes almost everything, and if it doesn't, it is easy to add your own. There's a quick add feature in case you don't want to put in all the information. Recipe builder. It's very easy to look and see what something will add to your meal without actually adding it. Also, the app creators are very responsive if you have any questions and email them through the app. Definitely a five out of five stars!

----------------------------------------------------------
My Macro+ is one of the greatest apps I've used to calculate my macros and calories. I switched from MyFitnessPal to this and have to say its one the best decisions I've made. One of the best futures is that you could actually manually enter your protein/carbs/fat goals for the day. it has made tracking easier for me and would like to thank Jason for creating such an amazing app. My only recommendation would be to add in a barcode scanner and create a bigger food database. Other than that, the app is one of the best.

Title: Great App for Tracking Macros!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love the barcode scanning feature - this makes things so much quicker and more efficient. The search tool seems low in pre-loaded items you can find. For instance, Starbucks only shows one drink when I search the brand. The barcode scanner definitely makes up for it though! Also, it'd be nice to be able to apply different macros for different days rather than having to switch it for the entire profile (rest day vs. active days). Overall, I LOVE this app and prefer it over MFP. Definitely worth the purchase.

I'm happy with this app - I wanted to experiment with higher protein and lower carbs, and this makes it very easy for me. I've been measuring my food for a year now, started strict Paleo, went to Zone, and now I like this 40/40/20 thing - I've lost 4 pounds in a week (was eating too much fat by about 20g a day). Goal is to gain muscle and get leaner. Only thing I don't like is the lack of exercises that I do in the My Workout + app, it could use some fine tuning. But I love this app, definitely what I needed.

----------------------------------------------------------
I tried MFP first because it seems like everyone uses that but I didn't like it at all, I thought it was confusing and not user friendly. My Macros is the exact opposite, it's easy to use, it makes sense and once you get a solid list of favorites going it only takes a few seconds to input your meal information. I love how it shows me the F, C & P breakdown for each meal, it shows me the total I've consumed so far, the amount I have left as well as what my daily totals should be. I can track my weight too!

Title: Best macro tracking app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using My Macros+ for almost 2 years now and I love how easy and flexible this app is. When entering a custom food, I like how it breaks the serving size, regardless of entry, down to the "1" ounce, gram, fl oz, etc. so you only need one entry per food instead of multiple entries for each serving size. It also comes with some pre-loaded recipes, multiple macro profiles, allows weight tracking and following other users. That's just some of the features. It's well worth the $2.99 in the App Store!

----------------------------------------------------------
Food search database is not easy to find what you are eating. The size of the servings is not the same as the nutritional label so a lot of calculating or searching for how much you actually ate. And all of the ‚Äúcool‚Äù app features require money. Why are daily notes part of $5 a month charge??? Why can‚Äôt I use graphs for carb progress or weight progress with extra money?  I understand coaching and advice, but the rest??? What is it extra money for graphs and being able to take personal notes or diaries?

For years, I always felt like I had a healthy diet. I was even a total vegetarian for about ten years (don't you dare call me a vegan). After reading so many one sided arguments saying that I was doing everything right, I began questioning this infallible evidence. I started seeing study's showing how different fats benefited the body. I read about bioavailability of animal protein versus plant proteins. I finally came to my own conclusion that a well balanced, diverse diet is the most beneficial.

awesome. download. my favorite hands down. easy to use, plenty of features and flexibility. however, id take the time to enter all of my own custom food. will be time consuming the first week but once its all saved and stored you are good. but some of the "verified" foods in the search are way off. saw a "verified" brain octane (mct oil) that said 1 tbsp was 1100 calories and 274 grams of fat. WAY off. this is minor but just be aware of foods you search for rather than input manually.

Anyone that's looking to compare this app to MFP shouldn't, because they aren't really meant to do the same job. Unless you're willing to pay $10 a month for premium MFP (I'm not), then this is so much better. The food entries are so much more accurate and you're not over-inundated by hundreds of incorrect entries, and it is so awesome to see where you stand at all times with your macros right at the top of your screen. I love it! It took some getting used to but it's been awesome.

I never write reviews because nothing really blows me away like this app and the sister app MyWorkout+. Both are absolutely perfect if you are tracking your macros and calories in vs calories out since the two apps link together. However, the Workout app might fudge the numbers on calories burned a little but it's still a somewhat accurate depiction of what you're burning throughout your day and during your workout. Anyways, love both apps and will be using them forever.

This app really makes tracking macros easy. I recently hired a coach to help me lean me out, they use macro based program and recommended my fitness pal. I didn't like how it wasn't macro focused. This solved all my problems. The best part is if you enter a custom food based on grams it will automatically adjust the entry to show you how much a 1gram serv is. This makes it much easier to input the food the next time you eat it if the serving size is different. Perfect.

If you eat a lot of prepackaged stuff MyFitnessPal might work better as it has a database that seems larger, but I found the barcode scanner worked a good deal of the time when finding foods.  I mostly cook my own food and measure every ingredient anyway, so the fast track option is fantastic for me.  Also love the home screen force touch feature as well

This app makes tracking macros super easy and efficient. The only thing I wish they would add (which would perfect this app) is that at the end of the week that they would email you a grid of your total cals consumed each day of the week AND your macros. It would make it a lot easier if you have a trainer or like to spreadsheet your macros to see you're coming along. But i guess for now, I'm stuck scrolling through each day righting them day separately.

I think ‚Äúserving size‚Äù and ‚Äúserving name‚Äù need to be changed to amount and unit because so many people get it wrong. But, I love that once I make my own, I know exactly what I‚Äôm eating and it makes it totally easy to track and you can customize what you see for each meal and the meal names (as many as you need)! I‚Äôll never use any other macro app again!

Title: Only Missing One Thing
----------------------------------------------------------
Firstly, the things I love about this app. It is by far the best looking nutrition tracker on the store. The interface is easy to navigate and the macros are displayed appropriately. It is as close to perfect as you can get except you thing. The data base is so far behind MyFitnessPal that finding foods without the label scanner is super hard. If you eat the same things over and over though - it does save recent items and it becomes much quicker.

Title: Fantastically Effective
----------------------------------------------------------
Love this app, it‚Äôs better than all the rest and I‚Äôve tried them. The app is simple to use, intuitive and information is provided about what you‚Äôre eating in multiple ways (the pie chart is a great feature). Being able to add and save custom foods and adjust amounts as needed really makes the macro life easier. There should be more food categories though‚Äî fish, beef, non-dairy. Totally recommend this app whether your a macros guru or brand new!

Title: Best food tracking / macro out there
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been an avid MFP user for a long time and purchased the Premium service when it came out. I am a certified Fitness Nutrition Specialist and wanted to be able to recommend a more affordable option to my clients so I downloaded this app and started tracking my food on it. Yes, the food database is smaller than that of MFP (MFP database oftentimes is inaccurate), but it is really easy to add foods to it and once you do they are there.

Title: I credit this app to the majority of my fitness success
----------------------------------------------------------
I think this app is amazing. I enter all of the nutrition facts myself, which if you're making your own food shouldn't be very difficult. This app is made to track your MACROS...and your macros consists of calories, protein, carbs and fat. If you're looking to track anything else, than this app is not made for you. Otherwise if you're looking to build muscle and shred fat, this app will definitely help get your diet where it needs to be.

Title: Amazing app!
----------------------------------------------------------
Personally, I consider myself to be a rather avid and regular gym-goer/lifter, and when I began my individual fitness journey in 2013 I knew I would need something great to track my calories/macronutrients with that was more reliable than a notepad every single day. Since then, I've used this app literally every single day to add and log my daily nutrition and to keep track of my dietary progress (or sometimes lack thereof!). Great app!

Title: Love it
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to used Nutritionist+. This is far better. In the passed 5 weeks, only crashed once. I love the "fast track" option. You just input the macronutrients and it doesn't save it to your database but saves it to your day of eating. Covinient when your eating out. What I would like to see added is a option to take notes on the days of eating. I believe it would make the app more versatile and totally separate it from all competitors.

----------------------------------------------------------
Just made the official switch over and am in love. It's so easy. No more pulling out my calculator to figure out fractions of a serving. This app makes life so easy. I am just stepping into an offseason that is looking to be a great one with this app! I am extremely precise when it comes to my macros and this app is even more precise than I am! If you are serious about tracking numbers this is the ONLY app for you! Awesome job Jason!

Title: Takes the guess work out of cutting weight
----------------------------------------------------------
Myfitnesspal is a waste this app has everything you could ever need and the manual entry is my go to for new foods. Once you've built your own database with your most eaten food you are clear sailing the weight tracker is pretty useful to. The barcode scanner is fantastic and if you noticed a discrepancy between the macros when you scan the barcode to when you check the label it is very easy to edit the entry and update the numbers

Title: Macro tracker
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is awesome. Keeps track of everything you eat, like a lazy man's food journal. It doesn't matter what your goals are, whether it's to lose weight, maintain weight, weekend warrior, or professional bodybuilder/model...you plug in the macros you want to achieve and it tracks them for you by the food you log, and it gives you the remainders you need to meet throughout the day as you eat. Works great with the Renaissance Diet.

Title: Excellent app, been using it for 400 days straight
----------------------------------------------------------
If your goal is to set and track daily calories/macros, this app is phenomenal. The databank can be a little lacking, but the ability to enter custom foods and recipes means you can account for just about anything you eat if you want to. The recent and frequent food options are super convenient. It may seem tedious to enter a lot of foods at first, but once you build a library of foods you regularly consume this app really shines.

Title: Great app for athletes!
----------------------------------------------------------
This has been great for me in adjusting my macros for my various nutrition plans. My husband, and I do weightlifting 4-5 days a weeks we've done various programs including various shreds, and muscle building. I'm able to accurately adjust my macros with this app. I love that there is a specific category for pre and post workout, and you can add custom foods. This has been the best app I've found to fit my specific athletic needs .

Title: Great support
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used this app for over a year and I love it. I bought a new phone and all of my data including every recipe I built and every food I logged was gone. I emailed the support team and they answered within a day and after a little back and forth got all of my data back. Super responsive and quick fix! Definitely worth the one time fee for the app that lets you customize/change your macros without a monthly fee. Thanks Jason!

Title: Great for macros
----------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes I have to edit the macros count for some items that I scan because they do not match. The app takes a little of getting used to when adding your meals and editing if needed. All I don't want to use this app five times a day. Now that I have gotten used to it it takes less than a minute of my time each time. Great for trainers, nutritionists, bodybuilders, or health awareness who want to keep track of their nutrition.

Title: The greatest App for Macros
----------------------------------------------------------
Let me tell you I tried a whole lot a macro apps and by far they don't come close to this ones standards. It makes everything so simple for you plus you can add your own macros depending on what food you are eating. And the best feature in my opinion is the bar code scanner feature when you don't have time to look up macros on a certain food product. By far the best macros app out there in the market. What are you waiting for?

Title: Truly useful app
----------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely love this app-it‚Äôs working very, very well for me. Easy to fill in custom items, recipes, scan bar codes and nutrition labels. Once it‚Äôs set up for your habits it‚Äôs a flash to use. Love that it keeps a running total of how many macros are left in each category too. I use it to track water, supplements, daily weight-it kind of does it all and somehow is remarkably flexible without ever being glitchy. Excellent!

Title: Breakthrough
----------------------------------------------------------
Looking back I thought I‚Äôm eating just right but didn‚Äôt realize that everything we eat just add up, no wonder I stayed on the same weight for the last couple of years. Now I‚Äôm being mindful of the food I eat, I make sure that I get the right amount of each macros in my daily meals. Counting my macros is more of a fun rather than a hassle. I was skeptical at first but now I enjoyed eating and seeing the results. Love it!

Title: Better alternative to MFP
----------------------------------------------------------
I switched over to this app from MFP when that app started playing video ads and wanted to charge a huge monthly fee to properly track macros.  Once I got used to it, I actually prefer this interface.  I don't bother searching the database for new foods, once you get used to it, it only takes about 5-10 seconds to enter the macros for a new food item, so that's easier than searching the database or scanning the barcode.

Title: Who knew I could keep a food journal?
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app! Took me a little time those first few days to get things set up, to get my basic foods entered (not that it takes a long time), and to figure out how to use the app. But now I can typically enter my meals and snacks in no time at all. So easy and super helpful for the LCHF eating plan I started in January. I've never been a fan of tracking meals, but this app makes it easy and actually kind of fun?!?!!

This app just keeps getting better and better.  I really like tracking exact macros, being able to easily change daily macros, copying meals from any day, easily change recipes, having a running count on remaining macros.  Recent update allows you to post the contents of your recipe individually or by recipe name..brilliant!  Super simple app, great customer support, can't imagine using anything else. Thank you Jason!

----------------------------------------------------------
I utilize this app daily. I love the features that allow me to save recipes; copy and paste to the next meal or day; copy recipes from other users in 'My Circle'; the barcode scanner and it's quickness; the data charts for weight trends; the ability to save nutritional goals and apply it to days depending on training schedule; AND it's compatibility with Avatar Nutrition!  Keep up the great work - this app is awesome!

Title: Great App. One minor detail ....
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this tracker. It takes my personal info and does all the daily intake calculations for me. It stores my meals for the day and tracks my macros. I can look up foods nutritional value or enter a custom amount. There's a bar code scanner too. The only thing I would change is the accuracy of the bar code scanner, BUT I can override the info and fix it myself.  Miner issue. Overall satisfied with my purchase.

----------------------------------------------------------
I decided to try this app for my contest prep for my upcoming NPC shows. I've used it for the past 3 weeks and love it. My prep coach has me changing macros constantly for training days, non-training days, and refeed days. This app makes it easy to change meals from day to day as well as keep favorite meals and foods stored for easy access. I highly recommend if you're a competitor looking to track your daily macros!

Title: Necessary tool
----------------------------------------------------------
Whether you're trying to lose, gain, or maintain weight - I would recommend this app hands down. It's extremely flexible and very user friendly. I really appreciate that it tracks and reports more than just calories and delves into fat, carbs, and protein. There's also a feature that lets me set different macro goals for different days. Like any tool, it takes discipline to use - but I highly, highly recommend it.
