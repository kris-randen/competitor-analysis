Title: Would never recommend- rigid policies. Money making monsters .
----------------------------------------------------------
This was the third session that I was going to attend today. I fully paid the membership for the entire year . I was late for . 7 minutes to my third class due to last minute emergency. I marked the attendance, however was simply denied access to the class by the management. In my previous two sessions, nobody from cult side explicitly told me that you can’t be even 5 minutes late to any class otherwise entry won’t be allowed. I politely asked the manager to give me this one time exception as I was not aware of the rules . Also , anyone can have last minute emergency and if that has not been a pattern of that person. Nobody listened and was humiliated in front of the whole group and was simply advised to leave . I am a working professional in the service industry and understands the importance of rules and punctuality . I respect the culture of discipline . However one time exception to that person who wasn’t even told the proper rules should have been taken into consideration as a courtesy . Top of it , I am paying for the session. Also they have a no show policy , if you don’t turn up for any class pre-booked , they would reduce the same number of days from the membership duration. A person who is coming late has to come to the class to avoid being marked as a no- show even though entry to the class will be denied . Am I studying in some school ? I understand how a customer treatment and experience can be deal breaker. In this case , it has been for me . I would never ever recommend cult to any of my friends, family members or colleagues.

Dear Akanksha, While bringing in a culture of discipline might be one of the reasons for having such a a philosophy in place. The biggest reason for denying entry to a class after 5 mins is to ensure member safety. The first 5 mins are where the bulk of your warm up happens. A good warm up prevents common workout injuries. Since you've only begun your fitness journey with us, the last thing we want is an injury to disrupt both your personal as well as fitness routine. We truly hope that you understand that our philosophy is not one that's meant to go against you but one that ensures your safety. We hope to see you soon at Cult.

Title: Pathetic customer service & false schemes
----------------------------------------------------------
Cure.fit’s customer care service is degrading day by day. They don’t care about your demands, they only care about their own benefit. I was supposed to get extension for referring a friend to join cult who joined cult successfully but they gave me no extension, even though it was their own marketing scheme. Moreover, I was supposed to get extension after resuming my pack, they first said they will give the extension but they didn’t do so. I sent them an email again saying they haven’t given the extension and they simply ignored it. After a day or two, I sent them an email again for them to reply. I legit had to remind them to reply to me. Even then they’re unwilling to give extension, their records are not updated. They have no clue about the timings I paused and resumed my pack. And the worst part is- they didn’t comply with their own statements. They said they would give extension, but they didn’t. There have been many other instances like this. Their customer support staff is highly incompetent.

Title: Flawed pricing policy
----------------------------------------------------------
I took 2 trial sessions at cult. I very much enjoyed the class and was motivated to buy their package at the offer price of 9999 for 4months. Which now is 9950 for 2 months. The terms and conditions clearly mention they can take back there offers at any given point in time. The problem is the price manipulation and the frequency they do it at. Company only gives a small window for discounts on smaller duration packages and promotes purchasing a higher package and this is where i got disappointed with cult. From being so advanced with their programs and plans they decided to go with same old business model which every gym follows luring in customers who are first time fitness enthusiasts and recover revenue for a year. Eventually adding zero value to the final customer. They enabled an option to book a session at 450 at the centre? Who wants to pay that much for a session with 10 people? Unable to see the value add though i was a customer at first but highly dissatisfied and disappointed.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Sorry to hear that you missed out on our 4 months offer. We do have an amazing offer running at the moment where in you get 6 months of membership for Rs 13990 against the base price of Rs 27980.

Title: Your app is okay  but what so ever No contacts makes it dodgy startup company
----------------------------------------------------------
The app is not bad lots of useful informations for people looking for fitness videos. No proper clarity in your website or application makes it difficult to believe you people are genuine. But I am not sorry to say this,  your eat.fit kitchens and it’s locations where  unhealthy food ingredients in use and unhygienic filthy horrible kitchens and the direct venues of cult.fit and care.fit are unsafe and threat to humans in existing cities and still you people are busy expanding and entering into other cities and in Dubai as well.Signing up a lots of new subscribers with limited slots is  a cheating business with weird terms and conditions that are not customer friendly which is printed in a tiny microscopic words will not help you to be trusted brand or company. A company with NO contact person names and  numbers makes one thing  clear,  it’s not safe to subscribe any plans with your cure.fit and regret for being cheated.

Title: Food is good but delivery and hygiene during delivery was pathetic. Back to back spilled curries.
----------------------------------------------------------
Honestly I have high respect for cult and curefit. But food delivery which is most important these days(specially after cautions deliveries by Swiggy and Zomato) was worst. Remember I am not quoting here quality of food, it’s the casual packing and henceforth spilling and then enforced delivery and then complain attended by one Mr Deep quoting that only cutlery got spoiled owing to spilling, so henceforth nothing big to cry. Spilling means loose seal and contaminated food, that itself is not acceptable. Sadly spillage spoils your complete order and no one feels like eating that kind of food. Imagine kheer with curry on top. What health man and what calories if open food is kept in a riders bag full of dust.

----------------------------------------------------------
I ordered my meal at 12:15 and they gave me a time slot for deliver about 1-1:15 will be estimated time taken. As assured they didn’t deliver the food. the health crew members not able to attend the call 3-4 times & for 5th attempt he attends the call, and say as he not able to locate the location has he had mobile problem not able to track. The customer executive talked with me 2times, for the 1st time they assured me will be delivered with in 10mins as health crew member is nearby, for the second call they say will refund amount. They made to wait for 2hrs and that is the way responded.....

Title: Not recommended at all
----------------------------------------------------------
They just say unlimited classes but wont allow you to book as many classes you want  . You can only book 4 classes in 4 days which is not what i was told . They do not follow a particular schedule in conducting classes . Few branches in hyderabad are pathetic built in very small areas . The washrooms are tightly packed . For yoga classes people will be standing around watching you which is quite awkward . Only few branches have separate area/hall the rest are just open where people walk in with shoes in the mrng and in the evening we put our face on the same carpet while doing yoga .

Title: No 6 AM classes!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I joined mind.fit because I liked that they had daily 6 AM classes on all days. Within a few weeks of joining, they have removed 6 AM classes on alternate days. And the 7 AM class is usually extremely crowded. So now I have signed up for a ten month membership that i cannot use because the administration decided to do away with time slots at their own discretion - probably they do not make profit if the classes are not overflowing. Tomorrow if they do not get enough members, they may cut down on the classes further. Be careful before you join! And don’t pay for long term memberships!

Title: Disappointed customer
----------------------------------------------------------
Honestly I have heard just good things about them but my first hand experience has been horrible somehow. My understanding was that they are responsible for any losses or mis-happenings that happen on their premises but they just blatantly denied my request. I was even prepared to meet them half way for the expense of my phone being damaged due to someone else’s negligence on their premises, but they denied even that option. So much for a marketing face but a real disappointment for my actual experience. I expected better from you guys!

I had a terrible experience with the Malad centre. Unprofessional, indifferent and diffident from the start. The ‘dance’ studio had a bunch of disinterested, unfit af looking people who claimed to be trainers, or so said their tees. If you liked Gully Boy, you will get an immersive experience here! But if you’re serious about hygiene, health or fitness, walk yourself to a professional gym. There might be one round the corner! And hey Cult, learn to respect your customers; it’s a quality that never goes out of fashion!

I had ordered food from zomato, the delivery was all fine. But guyz please never do a mistake of ordering from this app! Here, i ordered at 9am and it says my food would be delivered at 12 noon!! Who does that!!! Also, there is no customer care number on the app whom you can contact nor can you find any number on google! Also, when you call the number available on justdial, it’s still useless as they won’t pick up anyway! Long and short, waste your money by ordering on this app! Pathetic support!!

----------------------------------------------------------
If you are coming from far, you just CANNOT meet traffic jam or any other 5-10 mins emergency, if you do, better go back. Because they'll not allow you. They'll not hear a single thing, they'll just not let you attend the class. They'll allow you to mark your attendance but no class. I totally understand the discipline thing but one emergency?? One genuine reason? I felt very waste when I had to cover 12 kms back to home without even attending class.

----------------------------------------------------------
I have been trying to open the app for half an hour and it keeps shutting down. After the new update the app is very confusing to use and it is not beginner friendly anymore. I cannot find the beginner’s workout I was doing. It mostly just shows dance and yoga options which I do not prefer. The app is confusing to the extent that a beginner cannot understand where to begin. I feel like my money is wasted after the new update.

Title: Regimental and inflexible; no support for customers
----------------------------------------------------------
They will bar you from attending a class if you’re five minutes late (traffic or weather notwithstanding. You can’t cancel a class if you’re running late, but if you don’t show up, they penalise you by reducing your membership days. Also, there’s no way you can contact the facility if you want to (no contact numbers provided). Some of the staff I encountered were rather rude and cocky. All in all, a disappointing experience.

The app has several issues. This startup has grown huge in near future but the tech is still bad. Fancy from top but it's bad at the core. The video buffer time is in minutes when high quality videos are buffering at very good rate at all the prominent other applications. Fitness center is fine. The good thing is the intensity at which they train. Just started, so I can't comment on their exercises and their patterns though.

Customer support is non existent and reporting issue on the app for my subscription does not work.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hey, the annual membership priced at Rs. 8990 is the Cult pass that gives you access to third-party gyms and limited access to Cult centers. The annual pack priced at Rs. 16990 is the unlimited pack which gives you unlimited access to Cult centers and third-party gyms. You can write to us at hello@curefit.com and we will be happy to assist you.

Hi Ujwal, while we understand it took some time to get to the location, the first 5 mins of the class are the most important as the warm up takes place. Missing the warm up increases the chances of workout injuries. The last thing we want is for an injury to disrupt both your personal and workout routine.

I bought a subscription from eat fit and was supposed to get a puma voucher. But seems like these guys don’t intend to follow through with their offers. I have also raised 2 tickets and these guys have marked it as resolved without doing anything about it. I AM CANCELLING MY SUBSCRIPTION BECAUSE OF THEIR INCOMPETENCE!

Title: Disappointed now, was impressed in the beginning
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Eat fit guys delivered meals very late. They don’t give an option to call the delivery guy, so you never know when they arrive until they call you. Tracking is crap.

Title: Worst customer service
----------------------------------------------------------
I had booked for therapy session and somehow it got booked for wrong date and time. I asked them for help but they denied help me. This is really bad service.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hey, therapy sessions have to be canceled 3 hours in advance. We are sorry for the inconvenience, but unfortunately, we don't have the option to cancel or reschedule these sessions after the 3-hour deadline.

Title: Incorrect medical reports at Cure Fit HRBR layout
----------------------------------------------------------
I went for a full body health check up and they incorrectly showed my blood group as O+, although it’s B+. They’re unreliable and sent me incorrect reports.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Nayantara, we rescheduled the test for you and can confirm that your blood group is indeed O+ve.  We request you to check back with the previous reports you have from another medical facility.
