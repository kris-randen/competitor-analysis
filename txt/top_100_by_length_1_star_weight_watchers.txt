Title: It’s broken it’s broken
----------------------------------------------------------
I am a totally blind customer who has been using the  app for the last 4 1/2 to 5 years successfully. Yesterday there was a major update and now I am not able to use either the calculator or the quick ad. They have broken the edit fields so that when I try to put in the information rather than just excepting the words as I find the letters it’s putting in every single letter as I go by them   as well, when I try to put in the numbers that I need to put in it will not except the numbers when I go back to make sure the words and the numbers are in       the app it    shows every single number I went by to put them in but it doesn’t really put them in it just creates a mess. I really hope someone can fix this. So much of the weight watchers material and products that involve using scales for calculating foods etc. are not accessible and I am completely dependent I’m using the app as many of the books are not available to me. The app is the reason I have continued in the program, and I use and value both a quick add and the calculator. I really hope someone looks at this and considers fixing it. Weight watchers had an agreement many years ago that they would keep the app accessible. It is this accessibility that has made it one of the better programs for those of us with vision issues. I strongly urge someone to please please please fix it. We who cannot see depend on it.

Title: Data hog/constant overages
----------------------------------------------------------
I don’t review apps but this app is so awful I have to. This app uses more than three gigs of data every month (10.3 GB in four months with cellular data off the last month) and I have been having to pay about $30 in data overages every month since joining WW even after talking to the tech support and asking for help in the studio. To try to combat the data usage, I have deleted the app and reinstalled, logged out, set it to not automatically stream video,  and turned cellular data off for the app. The problem with this is that it means you can’t track food when you aren’t at home and you can’t scan anything at the grocery store to see the point values. This makes WW really hard to follow unless you only eat zero point foods. Also, you can’t use the app without a connection so would be  unable to use on cruise ships or while traveling internationally unless you buy additional data. My app was set to sync with Fitbit and made me share all data to sync, so this may be part of the problem, but I would not download or use unless you already have unlimited data or budget and extra $30-$50 a month for data overages. I am actually decently tech saavy but just can’t get this app to not burn through all my data. For reference, I use a hipbone and had a 6 when I joined and upgraded to an iPhone 11 after one week on the program. AWFUL!

Title: We Deserve Better!
----------------------------------------------------------
While this app is helpful in assisting you with your weight loss efforts, it is absolute crap. We pay for this app and deserve so much better. It’s search functionality is ridiculous. For lunch I typed in Chick-fil-A hoping to see all items with that keyword. The first search result was Crispy M&M’s. Even if you save an item as a favorite to try to make it easier to locate for tracking, there is still no guarantee that it will be the first search result when you look for it. You can’t add multiple items at a time, so you literally have to use the crappy search functionality to search for some of the same foods in the same portions that you may eat daily. Did I mention it’s slow???  Being able to track your food is literally the entire basis of the program and it is by far the most difficult thing to do. Again, we pay for this app! WW is a multimillion dollar company. Yet there is better technology and functionality available from smaller companies with free or cheaper apps. What gives?!! It’s seems like more focus was put into the social aspect of the app in being able to connect with others. While that’s important, that’s not the reason any of us bought into your program. We need to be able to easily and efficiently track meals. If you focus on nothing else. Focus on that! This app needs a major upgrade. ASAP!

Title: Maddening
----------------------------------------------------------
Have used weight watchers off and on for decades.  Successfully took 50 pounds after birth of my child. Now use for creeping 20. Has worked well.  This version is the pits! There’s absolutely no way  to get a simple list of foods and their points. So in grocery store you have to scan item and go back and forth.  You can’t plan in advance not knowing points. No way to ask a question. No way to change the program assigned at first entry.  I’m app savvy so it’s not that I can’t find it. Literally no way to find info. It’s not there. Their zero points food is alphabetical which seems logical, except that sometimes you want to see fruits or veggies so it’s an unwieldy way  to list stuff when you’re trying to plan. If you want to enter frequent foods, you have to go back and forth. Choose. Track. Choose. Track. MADDENING! Can’t just click on a few things and then enter. They hound you with annoying pop ups of false praise. They “reward” you with points to buy their crap. Oh dear.  Used to be such a good program.  Sad. Anyway, I’m officially done with weight watchers.  And that’s from a successful lifetime member.

Title: Features Unreliable
----------------------------------------------------------
Been fighting with this app for a while now trying to keep a Tracking Streak going, but the app just breaks the streak. Using the chat function on numerous occasions did not really help, so I gave up on that. Now, they’ve introduced another function, Challenges to earn Badges. No surprise, it doesn’t fully work either. I successfully completed the Top Tracker and  Seven Days Strong, but the Weekend Challenge is not crediting any of my Saturday meals.  Stop introducing functions which distract and frustrate us because they do not work. Also not happy wasting resources to print recipe cards for distribution in meetings instead of printing weekly topic information. I liked keeping the topic handouts in a binder for easy reference. I hate having to scroll through the Techniques Hub because there is no search or menu function. Also, the topic information is pretty bare bones compared to before and I would not say that my in-person Workshop Coach does a good job of expanding on it. At this point, I do not feel like I’m getting my money’s worth. Would I recommend WW to someone else? No.

Title: Weight watchers app
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is not user friendly. I often  have trouble with it not pulling up my daily food log. Many times I put my in food  for lunch, then the next entrance goes back to breakfast. If I don’t catch it, my whole lunch will go on breakfast. I had a times when I put my meal in and realize it hadn’t changed days. All my meals are on “yesterday’s” log. And right now, I can’t even put my food in, because they have an ad wanting me to subscribe to something else. I even took the new assessment in hopes it would let me move on to my log, but it won’t. I am paying for my membership and when it is over I don’t plan to keep it. I have been using PayPal for over 1,700 days for free and continue to use it.  It is very user friendly and has more of my local restaurants. If someone asks me about this WW app, I will tell them it is not user friendly, therefore taking more of my time to log in. I have never critiqued  a product unless I had good things to say, but after trying several minutes trying to log my food today and couldn’t even get to my log for an ad, I am upset.

Title: Huge bug that leads to point miscalculation
----------------------------------------------------------
Today I was trying to add points from a party yesterday, using the Quick Add tool. I tapped on Yesterday, then pressed + to get to Quick Add. On this screen I typed the amount of points and then typed the name of the food. The meal was defaulted to lunch and that’s fine so didn’t change that. The date said Yesterday. I pressed Done, and it put all those points to today. I deleted that and then tried again to make sure I was doing it right, and it still did it. Tried one more time to be sure. Then I went to the in app support and reported the issue, and got transferred to some other team. She said I need to delete and reinstall the app. That should be the very last thing you want a user to try! I asked if she was reporting the bug and she said she didn’t know if it was a bug or if they changed the way you use it. What?!? They didn’t change it! It’s BROKEN. Super inconvenient and totally miscalculated because I was dipping in to weeklies. So the whole count is off.

Title: Used to LOVE the app - before most recent update
----------------------------------------------------------
The program is great and I used to LOVE the convenience and user-friendliness of the app. With the most recent update, however, the app’s built-in calculator has changed requiring all nutritional data to be entered rather than just the prior 4 requirements (calories, saturated fat, sugar, and protein). Because I weigh all of my food, and the calculator is more accurate than the barcode scanner or food search, the calculator is the main thing I use in the app and has now created a huge inconvenience. I have reached out to WW and spoken with 5 people who have not been able to fix the issue. I supposedly was escalated to technical support however I am still waiting to hear from them and have yet to get any update on this issue. Ironically, out of the 5 different coaches I spoke to about the issue, none of them had this problem on their app, so I must assume it is due to the most recent update 8.16. Please fix this WW. The app would be 5 stars without this issue.

Title: App not intuitive
----------------------------------------------------------
I like the concept with points and such but features that you use everyday are buried under pages and pages of promotions and other “help” articles. I want to track points and get out in most cases. Meals that you may have often are hard to find once you save them. If you search for a saved meal using exact name, it’s buried down several non relevant results (hard to find your saved meal). When I contacted customer service for help on finding my meals, they weren’t interested in feedback and sent me link on how to use the app. I would look around for better programs or apps that track your meals/food easily without all the fluff. If they would give me a choice to see all that fluff or not would make this a better app. For now, I would save your money and pass. Updated rating, so cumbersome to log points, enter meals, and recipes. Put the ad stuff on other pages and let me take care of business in an easy way.

Title: Worked great for a few days...
----------------------------------------------------------
I joined WW last week and the app worked great for a while. I as able to swap my Fitpoints for Smartpoints, so the more I exercised, the more points I got (which is great bc exercise can make me hungry). As of today, instead of Fitpoints, my dashboard tells me how many weekly points I have. I messed with the settings to swap for weekly points first - when I did this, then my dashboard showed me Fitpoints! But the thing is, neither point number was accurate. I tried the online help and it was useless. They told me to delete the app, restart my device, and reinstall the app. That did nothing. I reached out again - this time, they transferred me to technical support. But then the chat screen redirected me to a customer service survey since the first chat ended when I was transferred. This automatically ended my chat with tech support. I tried to chat a THIRD time. This person just didn’t respond to my messages.

Title: Zero Stars
----------------------------------------------------------
If I could give zero stars I would. I have never left a negative review in my life. I was excited about this service but no matter what I do and no matter how many representatives I tried to talk to because I was kicked out of the app multiple times the app was unusable because of a ‘connection error’. They said my profile was incomplete, and the app misreads that as a connection error. Completing my profile, uninstalling and reinstalling, logging out and logging back in, restarting my phone all did not work. I can not get a refund for the Weight Watchers service which I only bought because it has a ‘convenient’ app in lieu of meetings. This is absolute garbage. Not only did I waste my money and got my hopes up that this could be helpful I completely wasted my time and am quite discouraged. I wish I could get my money back for the service that they can not provide but that’s not going to happen.

Title: Weight watchers and app use to be paid.
----------------------------------------------------------
This is truly upsetting, no one on the weight watcher site when I read and then decided to join mentioned anything about using I tunes to be paid. It should be told to you! Also with the reviews have no real good news either. Problems with payment and that could not be fixed. Another one stated that at first the app worked well but after an update could not even use the app. No positive feedback on anything being resolved either. So needless to say I am hesitant to continue on with this whole process. Maybe an app. Should  not be used or be available until such issues are fixed. Weight watchers needs to tell potential clients how they will be expected to pay. And years ago the app was free. I am very DISTRESSED about all of this and now have to figure out if I should continue. Even is these issues for people had been fixed for them I would not feel so anxious.

Title: Will not support WW
----------------------------------------------------------
I have had a few qualms with WW but nothing compares to how I feel about Kurbo. I'm deeply unhappy about WW's new program for children. Teaching children a healthy lifestyle is important - this isn't how you do that. Children being indoctrinated into diet culture may result in a healthier weight for some time, but will likely also give them a toxic relationship with food and their own bodies. Women particularly are taught to feel shame about our bodies at every turn and now WW is engaging in that as well. An individual’s worth cannot be measured and an app in a child’s pocket evaluating food on a scale of bad and good is doing exactly that.  I do not want to give my business to a company that is either complicit in the promotion of diet culture to youth or is willing to brush aside the measurable psychological side effects of that culture.

Title: App is useless
----------------------------------------------------------
Hate the updated app!  The older versions were great, but the new one is useless.  Can’t sync activity with the Apple Health app because it will record one activity in two different categories, which means it’s giving me double activity points and messing with my whole tracking system.  Tried online chat as well as tech support by phone and got the same response from 3 different people— no way to manually delete the entry; disconnect sync; uninstall app; reboot phone; try laptop — nothing works to get rid of the double entry.  Very frustrating!!!  PLEASE, WW —- stop worrying about changing your image with all the new names and terminology and fix this app!!  No one care if you call it WW or Weight Watchers.  We care if the program works. For those of us using online (“digital“), this is 90 percent of the program. It’s not working!!!  😡😡😡

Title: Required app, but needs lots of work
----------------------------------------------------------
While the app is required for tracking and does mostly a decent job of that it’s user interface and programming leave much to be desired.  E.g. after entering most of a long recipe, one small finger swipe in the wrong direction removed the entire entry without warning.  E.g. it is terrible at searching unless you know exactly the right name of what you are searching for. E.g., it displays what it thinks are intended or recent choices but in fact is normally way off.  The database does not contain the recipes of WW’s own publications e.g. spiced tofu with peanut sauce from the Done in One book.  Poor, if any integration with Apple Health e.g., for nutrition info.  Responses to issues seem to be standard non-commitment lip service with a consistent “...We will pass this info to the proper teams for review...”

Title: On the new plan the app fails!
----------------------------------------------------------
So the new plan released today.   You have to hit next to go thru and select your plan.   The problem is on the very first page you can’t hit next due to a bug.   This is a horrible oversight and this does things like cost us shareholders money when right out of the gate the app fails.    After messing with it I found out you can swipe left or right, or if you very slowly scroll next will appear.   Scroll too fast you see next quick then it’s gone.    Also the faq link in the email simply does not load.  It loads the app and that’s it.   So another fail.    Yet another fail is you get asked 4 questions in app.   One of them is what meal is the hardest for you?   Huh?  In what aspect?  Hardest to fit in during the day due to time constraints?  Hardest to prepare?  Hardest to stick to points?

Title: Dates and Meals and Such
----------------------------------------------------------
Weight Watchers recently changed their app for the worst so that everything logs in at the current time, no matter which date or meal you start with. For example if you didn’t log last night’s dinner and you try to log it in today by tapping yesterday’s dinner icon, the app automatically puts it in in today’s breakfast, lunch, or dinner... depending on the time of day and how they have unilaterally  divided up the day. If you have lunch at 11, the app will put it in breakfast for you. Oh wait! If you look for the proper boxes and scroll bars to check, you can try to move it to the date or the meal to which you want to log it—but the app will still often change it back to its automatic setting. These automatic settings are a nuisance and they have totally stupefied what was a good app.

Title: The app does not work well
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m actually quite disappointed. I’ve used WW before and achieved my goal weight. I came back after gaining a few pounds over the holidays expecting the new and updated app to work better. In my opinion, it performs worse than previous versions. WW has rolled out all of this new branding for their new app and eating plans saying how user-friendly they are. Nothing could be further from the truth as it relates to the performance of the app. Instead of paying Oprah to be a spokesperson, they should’ve invested in making the app work for the users who pay for it. It’s VERY slow and the search function rarely finds the items that I’m looking for, even when I have recorded them in the past. If I can’t track my meals and points, what’s the point in paying for the program and the app?

Title: Difficult to use the app
----------------------------------------------------------
I really wanted to love the WW program. It got extremely difficult to use the app in my opinion. It is not intuitive at all. I constantly found myself scrambling around trying to find simple ways to input my data. Making recipes, looking up food items, entering activity, sinking other devices etc. I feel like all of these things should be easy to do. However, I found that I constantly had to scroll all the way down at the end of a page or bypass a bunch of advertisements or distracting images to get to the meat and potatoes of the app. I understand they want to sell their products and make extra money, but the distracting images in the way this app is set up it’s just not streamlined enough. I also had a difficult time canceling my subscription which is always very annoying.

Title: Recipe search completely broken with latest update
----------------------------------------------------------
No matter what I search for, I get the same results in the recipe search, and none of them are related to what I searched for. I search for chocolate, my top results are two ingredient dough turkey pepperoni rolls and some sweet potato thing. Search for gumbo? Same thing. Search for grilled chicken? Hope you like turkey pepperoni and/or sweet potatoes, because those are the top two recipes you're going to get. I get approximately 12 recipes every time I search and they are ALL THE SAME, EVERY TIME. As someone who cooks a lot and likes variety, this takes away the #2 reason I use this app. Fix this bug and the app is fine, but I'm paying for functionality I'm not getting. If you're considering joining WW because of the convenience of the app, don't bother until they fix this.

Title: Diets don’t work!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
WW caused me to develop an eating disorder. There is so much research that diets don’t work, but WW feeds off of the insecurities of people to make money. The vast majority of people regain the weight they lost plus more because when dieting, your body enters survival mode, slows your metabolism and then holds on to extra fat. Whenever I would hit a plateau because my body had enter survival mode, my coach would encourage me to eat even less even though I wasn’t eating enough for even basic metabolic function. It is disordered to track every single “bite, lick, and taste.” It is disordered to not be able to enjoy a night out with friends for fear of going over your points. It is disordered to starve yourself all week to have enough points left over for the weekend

Title: Life-changing program. Poorly designed app.
----------------------------------------------------------
The new update makes me mad. In addition to all the other tiles added to the home screen, now there’s a front page shop to buy their products. All of this has pushed the recipes and other options to the very bottom of the screen, which takes some scrolling to get to. I have a lot of custom recipes that I use frequently, and every update makes it less convenient to use them. I will not buy your products. I’m already paying for the program. You need to spend time updating the search algorithm and ease of use of the app if you want to attract the millennials, your next generation of users, to pay you for your services. At least let me customize the dashboard main screen so I don’t have to scroll through so many suggestions just to get to my recipes.

Title: $$$
----------------------------------------------------------
I am very in happy with this. It was okay for a while until I wanted to cancel the subscription because It wasn’t helping me. I canceled it in DECEMBER, and confirmed the cancellation(through email, and the second process of “are you sure you want to cancel?”). Now, I’m STILL being charged for it in February, and all my iTunes gift cards have been used up. I am furious. I didn’t know I was being charged until today, because since all my iTunes gift cards ran out of $$, it just started charging my card. Now, they won’t let me cancel because “the subscriptions been paid through apple itunes”. I had to $90+ in gift cards and it’s gone due to my Apple Music (which I want), and weight watchers... I’m never using this subscription ever again.

Title: Terrible app for a good program
----------------------------------------------------------
I cant believe that a worldwide recognized method to lose weight has such a TERRIBLE APP. Please, fire your app developer guys. Even fitbit has a way more user friendly way of tracking foods. It takes FOREVER to log a food. The unit conversion is terrible. Moving from oz to lb, grams or serving has never been so complicated. Also, in many cases doesn't even do the conversion right! It only reads some barcodes, many times you need to type the barcode manually! If you want to use grams you need ti scroll all the way from 1 to 500! If you want to add the nutrition value for a new food you have to do it manually, it doesnt read pictures from the label. Guys, you are dealing with hungry people. You need to have a system to log food fast!

Title: DO NOT PURCHASE MEMBERSHIP THRU APP
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm so disappointed in the shady tactics and poor customer service for this app. I was a WW member many years ago (online only, before they had a decent app). I downloaded the app, signed up, played around a bit, then went to the desktop site to see if there were other features missing in the app (recipe maker, chat boards, etc). What I found was that there were two membership options, both significantly cheaper that the one through the app! I contacted customer service immediately and was told "sorry, no changes until the end of your current plan." How about you offer the same prices online and through the app to begin with?? I've cancelled my membership (still have to pay the full month) and am so disappointed in this experience.

Title: Can’t Track FitPoints
----------------------------------------------------------
This was a great app until it stopped working the way it should. The app stopped tracking my FitPoints Stay Active at Home on my iPhone a couple weeks ago after an update. Today I finally updated it on my iPad and now I can’t track my FitPoints Stay Active at Home on the iPad either! And the FitPoints on Stay Active at Home have been reduced, there used to be 4 points for a higher intensity minute walk/run and now it only gives 1 point. Basically it just gives you one point for whatever exercise option you select. But no matter what I can’t get any FitPoints! I have logged out, and also deleted and reinstalled the app but it still does not work correctly!! This is very frustrating. Please correct the app as soon as possible!

Title: If I could give it a half star for service I would
----------------------------------------------------------
This app was pretty good. Then they “updated” it for all the different plans and I thought that was pretty cool because those who couldn’t get on board with the later iterations could use what they were familiar with. Unfortunately that also means you can’t create your own recipes any more without doing advanced math.  No longer can you put in how many servings and the recipe automatically calculates for you.  It won’t allow editing to change it either - I’ve tried.  Looking up common ingredients like vanilla evidently isn’t allowed either. I’ve tried to do it via the website and that was a big nope. I also tried to let the app administrators know and been ignored.  Maybe it would be better to go with Noom.

Title: Awful, Awful
----------------------------------------------------------
The app is awful. Not user friendly or intuitive at all. I was looking for an app that simply provides my point total for the day then subtracts the points when I eat. Looking up normal everyday foods extremely time consuming. Type in “coffee” and it brings up everything but a regular coffee. Very frustrating. Also they attach to your bank account and basically steal your money every month. You don’t receive a notification that they at charging you. Linking directly to you account is a way for these companies to steal your money. Haven’t used app in months but they won’t refund you even if you cancel a day after you’re charged. WW will never get another penny out of me, I don’t care how bariatric I get.

Title: Worst app ever!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve struggled with weight my entire life and have used many weight loss/tracking apps, WW is the worst.   I do like the focus on wellness but so many other things are missing and it’s not an intuitive app at all. I waste so much time poking around trying to find things.  The search function is useless.  Please look at features provided by Spark people (free app BTW), my fitness pal, calorie king, etc.  You don’t get an option to see what you’re signing up for when you join.  WW wants your money then you can look at the clunky, useless app.  A lot of good things in the program but no way worth $20 a month with this app. So disappointed.  Wish Oprah would read this review...

Title: Customer service is terrible
----------------------------------------------------------
When I first signed up for the app I didn’t realize weight watchers created 2 separate accounts for me. When I noticed I was being double charged I emailed the company and asked what was going on, to which they ensured me I only had one account. When I emailed them back again stating I was being double charged for the account they didn’t respond. Some customer service you got there. I deleted one of the accounts and then I was told I didn’t have an active account even though under my active subscriptions I still am indeed paying for an active account. I sent weight watchers yet another email and still no resolution. Terrible, terrible customer service not worth the hassle.

Title: New version is terrible
----------------------------------------------------------
I really don’t understand why the app needs to change so often. This new version is terrible. In an effort to be “slick” it takes the usability right out of it. First if all, finding a way to add a recipe was completely frustrating. It is now buried. And when you bring up the “create recipe” screen, there is no way to cancel. Second, I really like to be able to bring up my favorite list and manage it. GONE! Third, the one stop shop for adding quick add, favorite, recipe is distributed all over the place now. This is a terrible user experience. I don’t understand the need to change an app that worked so well for so many people. We’re there really a lot of support calls???

Title: Doesn’t recognize membership
----------------------------------------------------------
The app was working great for weeks. Now all of a sudden it doesn’t work. I’ve deleted and downloaded it several times over the past few days and get the same thing each time. I login and it takes me to the page where you select between the two memberships (one of which I’m already subscribed to). I click on the one I’m already subscribed to and it notifies me that I’m already subscribed (duh) and then nothing else happens. I’m just there on that page with the different memberships and have the option to look at the privacy policy and terms & conditions. Nothing else. For the price you pay for the membership, it would be SO nice to actually be able to utilize the app.

Title: Horrible update ruined my settings
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve never had much issue with this app other than it not being as user friendly on connect as using instagram. But after this last update all my settings were messed up (start weight was wrong, weigh in day was wrong, Fitbit no longer synced) Also, I logs me out randomly and then when I try to get back it it tries to make me reset my settings like I’m a new member. I have to delete the app and download it again to log back in normally. I am an iPhone user. I have been a member for 2 years and am at lifetime status. I use this app every single day and now I’m worried about the accuracy. I don’t know what happened with this last update but it needs to be fixed ASAP.

Title: DO NOT GET THIS APP
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been scammed so horribly with this app. I’ve been on the phone for days and no one understands anything. The customer service is in the Philippines so it is impossible for them to help you. I begged to be transferred over to someone higher and the woman was the rudest person I’ve ever spoken with. I was charged twice in one month $24 and $21 for two accounts even though I only have one. I was then charged $21 again this month, which is fine because I WANTED to use it. However, when I login it says “you do not have a subscription” (my ITunes and PayPal say otherwise) but when I click “purchase subscription” it says “you already have a subscription”.

Title: Bad update.  They’ve added lots of JUNK to the app
----------------------------------------------------------
They’ve turned a streamlined and easy to use app into a cluttered mess.  They have tried too hard to put in every bell and whistle.    On top of that they have set up the interface in such a way that it is now just one unnecessary pop-up after another.  Not everyone needs constant hand holding to follow the plan.  If they were really thinking about those of us with long-term success, rather than chasing down the next new customer, they would have made it possible to turn off or disable all of the new, and superfluous, widgets and pop ups.  It’s just like the name change from Weight Watchers to WW: unnecessary, confusing, and done for no apparent purpose.

Title: WW caused me to gain more weight and feel gross
----------------------------------------------------------
I did WW for almost 2 years and I gained weight! I also was absolutely miserable. I started out and lost 30 lbs... then went to maintain and noticed I started to eat a lot of zero point foods because I was always hungry. Little did I know fruits and vegetables can’t really fill you up and you need to eat more than zero point foods. I also noticed that when I had points or weekly’s left over I would tend to have a binge habit. I never felt good and to top it off one of the receptionist at WW weight shamed me when I got weighed and started gaining weight back. Please be careful using WW program I’ve talked with many ladies who also had these issues.

Title: One of the buggiest apps
----------------------------------------------------------
I recently joined weight watchers and rely on this app to keep me accountable in my day to day.  I’ve had installed for 10 days and have run into issues on 4 of them.  Right now I’m trying to update a meal and an receiving a ‘connection’ error. I am thoroughly disgusted and haven’t been in the program long enough to have/know of an alternative.  While it won’t make me quit the program, I wish I had a number of whomever wrote this app so I can share my frustration.  BTW I am an app developer and understand when software goes wonky - but this is one of the buggiest apps I’ve used on my phone. And WISH I could do the program without it!! Aaagggghhhh!

----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded the App Saturday night. My credit card was charged and I was unable to get into the app. I called WW today, Monday, for help. Gave them the information WW had emailed me and was told they did not have my information in their system as an active account, even though I had an email from them with a user name and password. I asked for help in getting the app to open for me and was pretty much told there was nothing they could do to help me. Seriously...that’s the advice I received. Not the service I expected at all. Very frustrating to say the least.  I had read the other reviews of that happening and though surely not. I was wrong.

Title: App Glitches
----------------------------------------------------------
I did weight watchers about 15 years ago and it was great. I started again yesterday and was really excited to do everything electronically.  I am finding the app to have quite a few glitches. It’s not saving information correctly when tracking food.  Also when you search salad you would think you would get tossed salad or chicken salad but instead you get restaurant type salad with 2 tablespoons of dressing, I scroll down and still no basic salad. I’ve had similar results when searching other items.  This is supposed to be easy and not time consuming, you should figure out better more relative pop ups for searches and work out the kinks.

Title: Underwear Selfies - Opt Out
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this app except for one thing. On my dashboard, which I can’t customize, I am forced to see people I don’t know posing in their underwear. For crying out loud people, where do you get off thinking anyone wants to see you in your underwear, especially people you don’t even know. Keep those pictures to yourself.  Do you really want your coworkers, your parents, your kids, your neighbors, your clients to see you in your underwear?   Weight Watchers needs to make the dashboard customizable so I can remove the Connect section.  I would give this app a five star rating if the underwear selfies could be removed from the dashboard.

Title: Terrible Update
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to love this app. I lost 42 pounds using the WW app in 2020 and have continued to use it to keep myself accountable because I’ve found logging my food helps me. The latest update made the app so much more difficult to use, it loads more slowly, and I absolutely hate that I can’t see what I’ve eaten at a glance anymore and only how many points I have left. Everything else needs a separate screen. This finally motivated me to stop paying for WW (since you can’t become a lifetime member if you’re digital, even after a year and a half of never missing a single day of logging) and start using MyFitnessPal, instead. Absolutely awful.

Title: Current version double counts hiking activity
----------------------------------------------------------
Version 7.9.1 does not recognize Apple Watch “hiking” activity as something that generates steps. So it double-counts fit points for hiking - you get the fit points for both the steps you took on the hike as well as for the calories burned during that activity. The app needs to be fixed so that it recognizes hiking as a step-generating activity just like walking or running, which do not double count fit points. Even more frustrating is that there is no place to report app bugs like this except via the in-app chat (where the very helpful guides are just not equipped to receive and pass on the feedback) or via App Store reviews. Sorry.

----------------------------------------------------------
I would LOVE to give 0 stars! I am so disgusted with the new WW Freestyle Program, hence the update to this on the app. Now 23 daily points instead of 30.. loss of 49 points a week and same extra points?? Are you kidding me? And WW mantra is so many foods now have 0. Well, that is great if you eat a lot of chicken and eggs, which were minimal points to begin with. Now I will have to keep track because I’m staying on the old program, with the old program point values ie) 30 daily 35 weekly extra or just plug in what I eat and reach 30 daily, taking from extra points daily. I’m NOT HAPPY, and I had much success on the old program/ app

I really enjoy this app, usually. It’s easy to navigate, intuitive and has a lot of information readily available. But I don’t care for the latest update (9.17.0) and how the food log changed. I miss seeing my number of streak days when I open the app. I miss being able to swipe to track yesterday’s meal. I sometimes eat the same thing two days in a row and unless I save the meal, I have to add each item back individually. Swiping to track yesterday’s meal saved all those steps.  Plus it’s more steps to get to adding food. This update makes me mad for how much money I pay a month to use WW…and being digital only, it’s even worse.

The app works great most of the time. There have been been issues with every update the last two times where after an update tracking history starts over resetting your daily tracking streak back to ONE. The latest update that went to select members is a complete disaster and poor design.  I like the 3 bar menu concept but the main screen is the poor design.  You can no longer swipe left to right to add the same foods you may have eaten say for breakfast the day before.  You now have to do one addition at a time. This needs to be fixed ASAP or I will consider quitting the program since WW can seen to make their tool work right.

----------------------------------------------------------
The WW app has more glitches than I can count. I constantly have to close the app and reopen it to search for foods I’ve used in the past. I was searching for Olive Oil a few mins ago and it came up with grilled chicken. The whole app needs to be redone. I have almost 3000 WW points but it says less than 2000 is available when I try to redeem my points. All of these issues makes using the app frustrating. I love WW but if the app keeps glitching I will be tempted to try something like NOOM because they sure advertise enough to peak your interest. Please please fix the app. It needs more than an update. It needs to be redone.

Title: Love WW but the app could change
----------------------------------------------------------
I really love WW but I used to be able to scan barcodes and it would be saved on my app even if I didn’t track that food. I loved that because I could go back and find them any time I needed. Now some things that I do scan and track don’t even save there. It’s hard enough to keep track of foods and it’s making tracking harder than it used to be. I just wish they would go back to anything and everything that we scan stays on our app and then we can delete them if we need too. I don’t like searching for the foods because it takes to long and I never know if I have the right thing. Please, please, please change it back.

Title: Almost awesome
----------------------------------------------------------
Let me start by saying that the program works if you can make the app work. I know this, because it was working fine for about a month. Now the app keeps logging me out, which makes it really complicated to actually track anything or to quickly check point values on something I want to eat. Tracking is already the hard part, having to deal with the lousy app just makes me less likely to do so, therefore less likely to be successful. I really don’t need an app that tracks my meals to have more security than my bank app. Like, is someone going to hack me and put in that I ate a pizza that I didn’t really eat? Stupid.

I signed up on a whim. I never really used the app but was locked in for 3 months. After I made the third monthly payment I canceled via text with a customer service person. Today, I see I’ve been charged again! I’ve already wasted so much money on this and never used it and now apparently I’m going to have to fight to cancel again and hopefully get my money back. It really is upsetting that even after I fulfilled my obligation to nearly $100 of something I didn’t like or even use that now I have to go through a mess to get it resolved and during a pandemic no less when I’m not working and have very little money.

I have done weight watchers before, and I love the program. However, this app is garbage.  I used My Fitness Pal for several years before coming back and I am sorely missing some of its features. Tracking is one of the most important parts of losing weight, but I don’t have time to manually enter recipes one ingredient at a time. How about adding features like: being able to bulk add ingredients and then finding matches for them, converting a picture taken of a recipe to an ingredients list, or even importing a recipe from an online recipe blog. It’s 2020!! We have the technology, and it’s time you all caught up!

I was charged $25 for a one month subscription but nothing ever came through. I downloaded the app and logged in but I have no points and the app continues to say I don't have a subscription, even after paying the $25 complete with receipt from Apple and an alert that they will be charging me again in one month. I have been on the phone twice with WW and once with Apple. WW claims they do not sell a one month subscription through the App Store, only one year. Someone had my money but both parties are pointing the fingers and I still have no account. THIS APP IS A SCAM APP AND NOT AFFILIATED WITH WW APPARENTLY.

Title: Program great, app not so much
----------------------------------------------------------
I dont know what happened since the last time.   This app does not do search lookups very well.  I tried the app on my wifes phone to make sure it wasnt just my phone, same problem.  I will type in a specific food and it will give me nothing similar. If I move around in the app then come back to the search, this will sometimes reset the search so I can actually track.  Other times i have to close the app then reopen in order for a simple search to happen.  When you make it difficult to do the tracking it frustrates me to the point of almost calling and canceling.  Love the program very frustrated by the app

Title: Recommendation
----------------------------------------------------------
Love the app, what would really make this a 5 star app if it could also include daily total caloric intake. Logging points daily has definitely made me more aware of what I am eating in a daily basis. However, some food/veggies/fruit, etc can be misleading as the points would be zero but still have calories. Those of us seeking to lose weight in a healthy way based on caloric intake have to manually add up calories to get the total which can be very time consuming and not doable on a daily basis. I am aware there are other apps available to assist with this, but ideally one app would be the best! Thank you

----------------------------------------------------------
Yesterday I downloaded this app on my I phone ,followed the steps to join and paid for my monthly subscription. When prompted to log in I am informed I do not have a subscription. My credit card has been charged. I’ve emailed and have not received an email back despite an automated email telling me they would respond “shortly”. This eve I called the 1 800 number and have been told I have no subscription. Again my credit card has been charged. When I do log in and go through the steps as I was to purchase again  I am told I have a current subscription and will be auto billed again in April 4th. Frustrated!

----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for sharing this with us. We're very sorry for your frustrations and hope we can help. If you've completed your purchase through the WW Mobile App, this means you've purchased and paid through iTunes. There may have been an activation issue after you completed your purchase, so we would recommend reaching out to Apple Customer Care for assistance, as we here at WW would not have access to the payments or subscription details with Apple. You can reach their Customer Service team at 1-800-MY-APPLE. Best wishes!

You type in the ingredient and then hit search and nothing happens so then I hit the search a couple of more times and nothing immediately happens but then it shows up  and starts swiping to the left however many times I hit the search function.   I’ve checked to make sure I’m up to date with updates, powered my device off and on, closed the app entirely, did a forced shutdown so I’m running out of things I could try to get this to work .... it’s been a frustrating experience .....

Title: Worst app I’ve ever used
----------------------------------------------------------
WW, you have the money and resources to make a decent app. Why is it so bad? Get it together. Ive compared tracking on other weight loss apps is so much easier. It will remember my common foods, I don’t have to know the exact name to search for something. This WW  app has glitches all the time and sometimes if you don’t know the exact name how something is listed, it won’t come up. It won’t remember something I ate yesterday or frequently track. And the layout is confusing. I want a simple user friendly app,  I don’t need 14 emails a day to share tips and recipes. Just make a well designed app.

Title: Worst app ever
----------------------------------------------------------
Belonged to WW years ago and loved it but now, no way! I wasted my $20 for trying it out after seeing the ads on TV. Try logging in simple foods such as red grapefruit and the list comes up with grapefruit vodka etc.. A simple bacon egg and cheese sandwich comes up with everything but. Can’t find fresh fruits like cherries without finding a list of every cherry dessert known to man. My fitness pal is where I’m heading back to. At least it’s simple to use and accurate. After one week of this, I’m so disappointed and frustrated. Shows how change can ruin a good thing! Good bye and good riddens!

Title: Activity Points Disappeared
----------------------------------------------------------
Weight Watchers works and I’m thankful for it. However there is an annoying bug with the app which has not been fixed in the two or three years that I’ve been using it.  My weigh in day is Monday, so my week goes from Monday through Sunday and should reset at midnight Sunday night / Monday morning.  For some odd reason, all of my Activity Points (obtained through the Apple app integration) on Mondays disappears every Saturday night at midnight.  As a result, the final day of the week has incorrect data.  I’ve tried to go back and reconcile the numbers a few times, but they just don’t add up.

Title: Buy through iTunes doesn’t give you the same benefits
----------------------------------------------------------
Was super excited to start using the WW app but come to find out if you pay for it through the App Store you are paying the same amount but don’t get the same benefits. Their excuse is they don’t have your shipping address even though I can clearly see from my WW profile online my address. Their suggestion is canceling your account and ordering through the website which deletes certain data information. What a joke. It shouldn’t be that hard to figure out or collect data so everyone gets the same benefits rather than screwing over people when they’re already in the middle of a program.

Title: Waste of Money
----------------------------------------------------------
I hated this app. I previously used my fitness pal as a calorie tracker. The barcode scanner feature on the free version of that app was great. Almost anything I scanned immediately came up. I was also able to search for brand name foods. I assumed that since I was paying for the weight watchers app that it would include the same functionality. The search would only return one or two options and rarely was able to find brand name foods. And the barcode scanner always wanted me to manually add the nutritional information . Horrible user experience, I would not recommend to anyone.

Title: Junk
----------------------------------------------------------
You have to pay the WW fee of about $21 a month to be able to use this app so you would think that it would actually be usable but I’ve never had an app that has had so many glitches. Before it was randomly logging me out. Then all my progress was erased. Then it randomly appears again weeks later triggering WW to send me all the same charms again. Now it’s logging food on the wrong days and not loading. I’ve had success with this program but if I can’t get the app to work then there is no program and I’m wasting my money. I’m seriously considering canceling after 2 years.

Title: Charged my bank cant access my account
----------------------------------------------------------
Terrible. Tried 3 different times to set up an account it gives me an error, but charges me and shows my subscription. I called WW and a rude phone associate told me to call apple. I contacted apple who said they are showing the subscription, so it is a tech issue and I needed to contact the app developer. Contact them again and I can’t get a word in edge wise, they try to tell me they can sign me up? Why would i sign up again if my iTunes account is showing I have an active subscription through November 16, but your app doesn’t recognize it? Would not recommend.

Title: DON’T GET SUCKERED INTO IT LIKE I DID
----------------------------------------------------------
I was hesitant on downloading the app and joining WW but I guess I had hope that they would tell me something I didn’t know.  I should’ve gone with my gut.  There’s no info on the app or on the WW website that I couldn’t get free from Pinterest or online.   It’s basically just another form of counting calories.   They make you commit to three months whether you like it or not.  (Probably because they know you’ll instantly see once you join that it’s nothing special)  I’m very disappointed with the whole program and I requested my money back but they refused.

Call one #, they want you to call another #. Call that #, they want you to call the first one you called. Get a process for helping your customers! I have called customer service a total of 27 times. I joined 5 days ago. Sometimes you get a person, sometimes they just hang up. The customer service rep is unable to communicate in English so I'm guessing you are outsourcing your call center. The app worked a total of 1 day. WW is a huge corporation, no reason for this kind of incompetence. Get some people who know how to fix your app & understand software.

Title: Just awful
----------------------------------------------------------
This APP and the corresponding website pale in comparison to MyFitnessPal.  It’s not even close.  How do you stay in business for this long selling a product entirely based around weight loss and still have such an awful menu when searching for everyday items???  I tried weight watchers 10 years ago and decided to re-up - I swear they have made zero improvements since that time.  I can look up almost any food, restaurant item or brand and find it on MyFitnessPal.  Not so much with WW. Just disappointed.  You have one job - how do you mess it up this bad?

Title: Keeps unsyncing for points. Waste of time
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to love this app, but now on random days or even entire weeks, once my fit points from my Apple Watch have been synced and added it will just delete them. Now when I go back, it looks like I haven’t earned any fit points some weeks at all and only a day or two on others. It’s pointless to keep going back in and adding for the random days that are getting deleted. I’ve lost my motivation to even earn the points because it’s such a pain to try and manually figure out what is missing or incorrect. Please fix this as now I’m stuck for 4 more months 😣

Title: Still very disappointing...
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried the WW app several times, each time hoping it would get better. First problem is that it wouldn’t register my latest weigh-in no matter how many times I entered it. Next and bigger problem is that if it promotes healthy eating, I should be able to find fresh fish in its choices - no halibut, haddock, sea bass, or grouper. If I search on fish, I get canned fish options. Also couldn’t easily find some veggies and why isn’t there a list of frequently selected foods like other apps? Didn’t renew and will never again. Better ways to lose weight.

Title: Weight Watchers is great but the app is hot garbage
----------------------------------------------------------
This review is NOT for Weight Watchers as a program. WW works great if you follow their plan, is super flexible and helps people manage their weight and health. What is not great is the accompanying app to the program. Compared to apps like MFP and LoseIt, the WW app database of foods is pitifully tiny, there’s no way to go back to a previous meal and add it to the current day (say in case you’re eating leftovers), there is no “saving” of your customized foods, so if you add something you can’t find it again at a later date and are forced to re-add it.

Title: Disappointed in updates and “new program”
----------------------------------------------------------
I love WW, and over the last year I lost 30 lbs on the program, using the app. I loved it! As usual, I struggled over the holidays, and as I try to recommit, I’m finding myself VERY disappointed in the changes I’ve found in the app. The “new program” seems to me to simply have added clutter and advertising. The app is less streamlined and harder to use, recipes are harder to navigate and less integrated, and I’m really discouraged that I have to spend so much time trying to find my way around a tool that used to work so well for me. Bad move, WW.

----------------------------------------------------------
Not sure what’s with every company feeling the need to overdesign the heck out of everything and turn every homepage into a “feed” but the UX of this app is absolutely unbearable. I was using this app 8 years ago and it was so well laid out, easy to use, easy to find every feature, barcode scanning or creating food was a breeze. Now? Atrocious. This app is a chore to use. Feels like I have to fight with it every time I use it. Weight Watchers is a great dieting program but this app is atrocious, everyone on the design/ux teams needs to be let go.

Title: Plus button missing on new update
----------------------------------------------------------
Entering Activities are more confusing than ever. I looked for two days on how to enter my activities since the + sign was missing. Terrible update in that regard. Now we have to guess what WW calls a specific activity in lieu of looking through a list. Bring back the + icon so we can see what activities to use. Historically I’ve called an activity one thing and found I was unable to enter it because WW didn’t have the same name, so I looked it up on the search list and found something close enough. Now it’s anybody’s guess. Not good. No stars.

Be careful when signing up because you can get locked into memberships that will penalize you if you if you wish to change type of membership. Also,charms for weight loss are only sent to Digital Members...Studio members must physically attend studio to receive charm. There is NO PHONE numbers to call for help everything is done thru chats and one hand doesn’t know what the next is offering. JOIN I Track Bites for points and caloric/nutritional logging. A much healthier approach. Take it from this Nurse that has learned the hard way and robbed.

This negative rating is for the new update, specifically the daily tracking feature. Why in the world would you make tracking more complicated?  In workshops one of the main reasons given for people not tracking is that it takes time. Well now it takes even more time. Specifically, if I go to the lunch tracker and put in the meal, why would you have a new screen pop up asking me what meal to track it under?  I already picked the lunch line!  We are busy people - make tracking easier. Put everything for daily tracking on the main screen.

----------------------------------------------------------
I find using this app to track my points very frustrating. It frequently takes me three or four tries before I can enter the food I want. Simple things like a banana took multiple tries this morning. I find the search mechanism to not be very smart. I tried entering sugar snap peas and they didn’t come up instead I got coffee without sugar and other totally unrelated items. Eventually I figured out that I needed to search peas, sugar snap. So because my search terms were not in the same order they didn’t find it. Very frustrating.

----------------------------------------------------------
Today is my first day of WW, and I feel ripped off. Whereas I can easily find our dining hall meals in MyFitnessPal, they are not in WW (not with accurate nutritional info), meaning I have to manually add everything. If that wasn’t annoying and time consuming enough, their app and website repeatedly crash, meaning you get to type the same info in again and again and again and again. Honestly, it took me 20 minutes to add a single meal 🙄. With how much they’re charging you’d think they could build a functional app and website.

At the absolute worst time in my life (my husband passed away) you have made it so hard to track that I am just not using the app. I need to get back on track with my weight, but if instead of you being the easy app I used to use, now everything is difficult. Instead of going to breakfast in the food log and finding a list of the things I commonly eat, three things I eat for dinner or lunch are the only things there. It’s so frustrating at a time I have no patience for this kind of difficulty I have just quit using it.

Title: The APP is a complete failure
----------------------------------------------------------
The WW program is good. Its easy to follow and you will lose weight if you follow it. The APP however is a complete failure. I wish they’d have given as much thought to APP development as they have to the point system. The APP crashes constantly, its difficult to use. You must exit the app and go back in to enter food because it constantly freezes. The WW staff acknowledged the failed APP and said “Oh yea were working on it”. The failed APP makes losing weight that much harder. The WW plan is good, the APP is useless.

----------------------------------------------------------
You would think that a program that encourages you to track your food would send notifications to remind you; however, WW can’t figure out how to do this. Their new program, which includes “Coach Live sessions” also doesn’t include any notifications. They want you to copy the link and put it into your calendar. I’ve tried this program on and off for years, and their app and support leaves so much to be desired. I won’t make the mistake again and sign up, until their technology is up to speed with their competitors.

The desktop website works fairly well, the app is not ready for prime time. A simpler flow would be to select a day, select a meal, enter food. But the app does not do this. When searching food, there is no simple “add item” button. When you press the “tracking” button, The searched food item is not added. Very confusing. Also when attempting to enter meals for days other than today, it still defaults to “today”. Very frustrating. How much did the company pay for someone to write this app? Lost money. Wonky app

----------------------------------------------------------
I want to like the app, but the food search is disappointing.  It takes me multiple tries to pull up basic foods.  I try to search simple items such as eggs, strawberries, etc and random foods like coffee will pop up, none of which are remotely similar to what I’m looking for.  Also, when I add items it typically doubles my servings. So I have to go back and edit most of my entries.  My daughter who uses the app has the same problems.  I’ve used other free food tracking apps that are more accurate and faster.

I started the process of signing up in the app and had to dump it and re-download three times. It kept getting stuck. Finally got to the point where I could make my purchase and then went through the initial questions to set up, got  to the 15th question and I can’t make a choice it won’t accept anything I tap on so I can’t even get started.  I desperately want this to work and will keep trying but I’m not very confident it’s going to function properly when getting started has been ridiculously complicated.

Title: Updated app version
----------------------------------------------------------
The look and feel and usability of the new update is awful. Last version where you can scroll to enter in your servings was way more convenient and the colors are more vibrant. The plain blue and white makes is a dull and depressing to use (welcome to 1995 MicroSoft). Can you go back to the previous version in regards to the look and feel and features. I would rather track in My Fitness Pal and forget about the WW Wellness points. Hopefully others will comment on what they think with the new update today.

Title: Really disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using weight watchers in January 2019 and this is honestly one of the worst apps out there. I can’t believe you have to pay for this broken nightmare. I get so frustrated trying to navigate and hunt for food items. It seems to randomly decide what shows up in recent foods and a lot of things aren’t there at all. Sometimes you have to really play with it to go back and change a past days items. I have used several free apps that are way better. Needless to say I am letting my membership expire.

Title: Great program, garbage app
----------------------------------------------------------
I love WW, but the app is practically non-functional. Considering the whole program is based on digital tracking, it’s disappointing that the app is glitching 75% of the time. Searches don’t register easily, the barcode scanner works sporadically, and it often defaults to yesterday as I’m trying to track today. I consider myself pretty tech-savvy, and this app isn’t cutting it. Please, WW, make upgrades. It is so very frustrating to pay so much for a good program that doesn’t have adequate tech support.

Title: Not working on iPad at the moment
----------------------------------------------------------
Yesterday I started getting a screen that says “Time for an update” with a link to the App Store.  When I go to the App Store there is no new update available, it just says “open app” which, when I do, goes back to the screen that says “time for an update” - there is no way to escape this loop.  On my iPhone, I was able to get an updated app so was able to update and continue using the app, but apparently no such update is available for the iPad so the app is not usable at the moment.  Please fix this!

Title: Deceiving prices will overcharge
----------------------------------------------------------
I called to cancel my membership early, was quoted a termination fee that was significantly lower then the membership. Had I known that the cancellation fee was higher then the actual membership I would have stay on! They went ahead and charge me a higher fee then quoted when I asked why I was charge a different price the rep who gave me the first quote quickly pushed me onto another rep who just apologized for her coworkers mistake and then told me they will not fix their mistake. Horrible experience.

Title: Poor marketing strategy
----------------------------------------------------------
I love WW it is a great program and it works. Recent changes announced at a mtg today are that you must wear SHOES for weigh in- no exceptions. We are now also required to “reserve” our spot at our weekly meeting by calling in or going on app to make the reservation. You will lose customers over this move- when you automatically debit my credit card for meetings I am purchasing the right to attend- how dare you now require that I must make a weekly call to reserve my ALREADY PREPAID slot. Bad decision.

Title: Bad customer service
----------------------------------------------------------
While the app it’s self works mostly right and can help you to count and stick to the weight watchers program, the worst part is when you no longer want to subscribe. I have tried 3 times to cancel my account and finally asked to speak to a supervisor. Guess what after 3 phone calls I still have never spoke to one, I don’t even think they had them I was either hung up on or transferred to a full mailbox. It was ridiculous and I will never do business with them again because after all this why would I?

Title: Horrible app
----------------------------------------------------------
I just signed up and the app keeps saying “something went wrong check your internet connection” I tried it on WiFi and on mobile internet and it keeps saying the same thing. Then I uninstalled the app and restarted my phone and reinstall it and it keeps saying the same thing. I can’t use the app at all because every time I touch a tab or tap on the screen for any menu change it keeps saying the same thing. If your gonna charge money for using your service you should have a better way to get support!!

Title: Why bother?
----------------------------------------------------------
This is the poorest excuse for a weight tracking app that I’ve ever seen.  Its prepopulated lists of food favor brand names and restaurants instead of giving preference to homemade.  Filters do not work.  If it weren’t for the fact that I’m a lifetime member, I wouldn’t use this app and certainly would not even consider recommending it to somebody else.  Come on, WW, you can do better.  It’s no longer the 20th century; time to join the 21st and upgrade your technology capabilities just a little bit.
