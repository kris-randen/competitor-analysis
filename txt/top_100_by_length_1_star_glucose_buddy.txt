Title: Great App but Sketchy Subscription/Customer Service
----------------------------------------------------------
I got glucose buddy back in February around when I got diagnosed. The free features were great and eventually I decided to try a free week of their $29.99 subscription as I wanted to do better. The counselor I worked with (Liz) was great and very informative and the lessons I got to read the first week were helpful, at the end I agree to start the subscription and stupidly gave my card info (important), I did not pay through the Apple store. Once I was signed up I still had my counselor, but all of the added features were gone. Honestly I didn’t really think of it right away, but eventually I mentioned it to my counselor and it supposedly got fixed, I wasn’t sure what all the added features were so I can’t say everything was correct. Thanks to Covid and my work hours being cut I had to drop all extra bills. I contacted my counselor as I couldn’t find any customer support, contact info, or how to cancel a monthly subscription. She gave me the companies customer support e-mail and I contacted them. I was told they couldn’t do anything. It was a subscription through Apple, but it wasn’t....there is no record of it through Apple (except for the fact I downloaded the app through the App Store), and my bank was always charged directly by the Azumio company. Any subscription I have gotten through Apple were always billed to Apple, not the individual companies. Customer service kept saying only Apple could fix it..... but Apple can’t as it wasn’t through them!!!! In the end I had to go to my bank. Which is a shame as had they not pulled all this bs I would have re-subscribed when I could. The App features are good if you choose to get this app, but use with caution!

Title: This app was great
----------------------------------------------------------
I loved this app before they changed to the subscription model a few months back. There are so many things you used to be able to do that aren’t available, even small things like using a custom label instead of before/after a meal. And now in order to share your graphs with your doctor you can only go back two weeks and you have to print it out vs email it. It’s a real shame not to be able to afford an app that used to be an asset to my medical care. I would have been able to use this app had there been a one time purchase price, but I can’t justify adding another monthly automatic charge just to log my glucose levels. I used to hype this app to everyone I knew with diabetes. Even my doctor was impressed, although I had to explain what happened when I could no longer send her my full detailed data via the health portal. Now I tell everyone about the app, explain how the developers forced a subscription model on users, and use it as an example of how patients suffer when profiting from their diseases becomes the goal. I wish I had never trusted this developer with my data. Now it’s locked away and I had to start over again with another app.

Title: Not easy to use, weird ad blocking screen
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m not sure how this has gotten such good reviews!  From the very beginning, there was a lot of pressure to “upgrade“, with even a warning of it this will be the “only time” I can upgrade, with a full screen countdown clock?  10,9,8...what?  Of course I said no, and it ends up that the features they were trying to get me to pay for, are already on the app such as your A-1 C average level?  I wanted to enter previous data from the last month but that became too difficult in this app.  When you are entering the information, they have a tag that you can say before breakfast or before lunch etc.  but then they don’t have a separate area to add food.  Even though I might be entering my fasting blood sugar level, they make you add the food on that page?  So in that entry you have to look hard to understand that I ate that breakfast AFTER I took my level.   Also after entering about four numbers, this ad began to block the view and then when you click the X to close it,  it would open it.  That happened a few times, and I quickly deleted the app!!! Never had anything like this on an app!

Title: I Used To Love This App
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used Glucose Buddy for several years and loved it!  It was so helpful to me, that I shared it with my diabetic health care team, in hopes they could let other patients no how it helped me.   That is no longer the case!  Version 5 of Glucose Buddy was released during the fall of 2017 and the App (in my opinion) was ruined.  First,  the data entry screen no longer fits on the screen of my mobile device.  Some of the selections are barely visible.  Second are the incessant and annoying pop-up ads that make viewing the App’s screens very difficult.  Finally are the high pressure ads to subscribe to the premium version of Glucose Buddy for a fee of $60 per year.   Many of the most helpful features of Glucose Buddy are only available with a premium subscription, which I’m unwilling to pay.   If you ignore the reviews of the pre-version 5 Glucose Buddy you can see the ratings drop from 4 & 5 stars to 1, 2 & 3 stars.  (check for your self)

Title: Difficult to receive support
----------------------------------------------------------
I was initially excited to have this app because it seemed to have it all! Exercise log, data sync, nutrition, weight management, etc. I was most excited to have the ability to sync my Dexcom! I made the premium purchase and.... have yet to have my Dexcom sync. I have tried several times and nothing each time. I attempted to find support for this issue. Stuff happens right? I attempted to get support through the app and revive an error via that way and then tried via the website and am prompted to purchase or have two weeks free of another application in order to receive support for it. I have tried several times to receive support and I have not been able to do so. It has rendered the application and premium purchase completely useless to me.

Title: Confusing interface
----------------------------------------------------------
The app really pushes upgrading to premium, to the max! I tried it but deleted it after struggling inputting information and then looking for food information. The records are not completely editable. There is no way to select food types and get your nutritional information. It says take a photo. Are you kidding me? I know what I ate! The app pushes a lot of costly educational materials. If I was new to diabetes I would be sucked in. But I am not. Just need a simple application to track sugar, meds, and meals in a understandable less then 100 page report for my doctor. What doctor has time to look at a huge daily report that it generates? To much useless add-ones. Deleted it after trying it two times.

Title: More than I need or want
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve used this app for quite awhile. It had a straightforward interface and feature set. The recent major upgrade of this app brought with it a lot of additional features, a major overhaul of the UI and sharing functionalities. All I need is an app that lets me record my blood glucose. I can’t imagine why I would ever share that with anyone! I don’t find the new overcomplicated UI to be an improvement either. The continued pop-ups asked how I like the app are really annoying, as are the overemphasized messages complaining that I don’t have location or sharing enabled. So, I’ve switched to an app that is simple and uncluttered with a swollen feature set. Sorry this app got so “improved”.

Title: Still Ads and No Support
----------------------------------------------------------
Not even counting the limitations on adding meals. Paid for ad free version to use, one year. Constantly get a pop up asking me if I want to purchase the app for a discount for a limited time that then disappears shortly after. Trying to add A1C to average, but apparently there is no support. When I try to access support from app it asks me to try something else for free it takes me to a sales force site where I can pay for something? Did they mess up a plug in for their app and it’s for their company or what happened? Try to access support from App Store and it takes me to a site saying it’s not found. Going to find alternative and cancel subscription.

Title: There is a Big Difference Between Paying for Something of that is Well Made & Being Extorted
----------------------------------------------------------
I couldn’t agree with MommaHippi more.  This app used to be something special. Something I would have paid for because it was worth it back then. But I wasn’t asked. I wasn’t warned. The app was just suddenly changed, and I discovered that if I wanted my information I would be charged a substantially large fee for it.  I’ve given the new app a chance, but find myself becoming upset when I try to use it.  Now it’s just like all the other apps that do the same thing - but the interface is ugly and confusing.   Developers do this to themselves and their customers a lot these days. It must be profitable. I’m going back to paper and pencil.

Title: Glucose Buddy is no Friend
----------------------------------------------------------
As a diabetic and iPhone user I had hoped this app would solve my problem of manually having to record blood glucose and insulin data.  Sad to report this product doesn't deliver as promised.  Had problem with logs being accurate.  Also customer service experience was the worse.  Explained problem twice and could get them to understand the issue.  Also, bought some add-on for $3.99, which I thought allowed me to access web-site and exchange data to iPhone and iPad....was told that feature is $14.99.  When asked what the $3.99 charge was for...the customer support guy, Tom, said he didn't know. I've deleted the app and I'm $3.99 wiser.

----------------------------------------------------------
So I download Glucose Buddy (free) and start setting up. In settings I sync, or try to, the Health data and the app never, recovers. I see it spinning next to the network icon. Close the app and reopen, no response from the app. Delete the app. Buy the $1.99 app and try the same thing. Sync Health and the app freezes. It’s only $2 bucks but come on, really. Your app does not work and won’t come out of the sync spin. Then the app blows up. I tried to use the contact from the Glucose Buddy site but that doesn’t work either. Disappointed.

Title: This would be good but one big problem.....
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought this 4 days ago and registered on their website so I could sync with their website and get more detailed charts etc... however.... I can't do any of that becuase after 4 days they've never sent me the 'verification e-mail" that I have to link from to verify my e-mail address.  I can't log into their website and ask them, I"ve e-mailed them twice from the app itsself, but I've gotten absolutely no answer.  This looks like it would be a good app if it did what it says it can do, but so far, ZERO customer service and NO LOGINS!

----------------------------------------------------------
I didn’t even finish setting up the app to get started. The app kept asking... well more like insisting, that I subscribe. Apparently the programmer(s) don’t have enough confidence in their app to inspire people to want the “premium” so they feel the need to brow beat you into upgrading prior to even using it. If they don’t have confidence in it, why should I? I deleted it.  For the other programmers out there, don’t nag potential customers. Let them try your app. If they like it and see the benefit of upgrading, they’ll do so.

Come on now the earlier version was nice and simple and to the point, would gladly pay $5 - 10 for the earlier version if still available!

I've tried contacting support several days ago-still no response, after paing for the App.  Problem has been I can't sync data up to the website.  It always tells me I haven't activated my account.  BUT, I can get into my account from the website - which presents another problem.  EVERYTIME I try to log in on the website I'm forced to reset my password.  It works, and my personal info is there, just not my BG readings.  When I log out I have to go through the process all over again of resetting my password.

Had high hopes when I downloaded this app. After wading through the tedious process of entering my data, I couldn’t get past the incessant pop ups to upgrade. I click on the ‘X’ to hide the ad and it took me to the upgrade page EVERY TIME. I’ve spent the last 15 minutes trying to find an email address to request they delete my info since I have deleted their app. Still cannot find an address. If I start getting email junk to buy or try glucose monitoring items, I’ll know where it started. Ugh!!!!!!!!

----------------------------------------------------------
V2 was a great tool - showed charts and allowed you to edit foods. v3 has removed charts, and the UI, while more slick, has an inferior user interaction. MYLEstone, please add the following. (1) Allow upto 400lbs weight, (2) A height of 5'11 always shows up as 5'10, (3) Allow user to edit/delete foods, (4) Do not gray out the numberpad if user opts to not select 'add food', (5) The dial on the 'food tab' is too large and makes the page display poorly, (6) display chart as in previous version.

Title: Syncing doesn’t work most of the time
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm requesting that the app price of $6.99 be refunded. It would appear that the developers no longer support the app (based on multiple comments in the app forum) and, sadly, the app does not function properly. The primary problem - and the reason for paying for the pro version - is that syncing rarely works. When one attempts to sync, whether via the website or via the app, the repeated attempts tend to time out in most cases, making the $6.99 payment a complete waste of money.

Title: Bring back the graphs
----------------------------------------------------------
I use this app daily. The reason I keep it over other glucose-monitoring apps was the graph which quickly could show me and my doctor whether my fasting glucose was in the controlled range. I unfortunately have to add to the chorus of other reviews that I will likely switch to another app unless the graphing ability is added back to the program. My physician was considering telling other diabetics about this app solely for the graphing capabilities. Please bring back the graphs.

----------------------------------------------------------
This is a buyer’s beware:  if you buy this app be prepare to pay more money than you thought.  I tried Glucose Buddy, and thought it to be adequate for what I need, so I bought it $3.99.  After I bought it, I find out that you have to pay even more if you want the advertisements removed $3.99, and if you want a two way communication with your online backup it’s another $12.99 per year.  They call these extra add-ons, which all other apps come with as part of the full version.

Title: Sorry
----------------------------------------------------------
I wish to god I would have used this app for a bit before purchasing the yearly subscription. Biggest problem is when you scan a food it shows everything there. When you go to insights and pull it up all line items are zeroed our. Then if you switch the serving it goes completely whacko. For example it listed something that should be 140 calories as 14,000 calories. The only way I can make it get even close to accurate is if I switch serving size to between .04 and .05.

I used to use this app and it was simple and met my need, which was to track my glucose level.  Now it is way too aggressive about wanting you to buy the premium version and to connect you to other apps ( like Apple health).  They want direct access to your glucometer. And they want to know your weight, diet, etc.  Basically, they want to get your money and then sell as much information about you as possible.  No, thanks.  I think I’ll just buy some graph paper.

The Testing In Pairs feature might be worthwhile to me over time, but I NEED the charting/graphing capability.

This used to be a good app and then they changed and now keep hitting you constantly with offers for upgrades and more paying services, some of which you can’t avoid.  Once you’ve logged in a bunch of readings, you can’t download or print out report for your doctor unless you pay.  If you don’t pay, then you have to write down your readings to provide to doctor.  I’m leaving to find an app that doesn’t lock your information down unless you pay money.

A great app. I've used it for years but it hasn't been updated or supported for a few years. I doesn't sync with Apple Health or other recent apps.

Title: Basics aren’t great

Too much going on in this app and the basics don’t function correctly. Each time I entered my glucose, the app would add a duplicate record. Sometimes it would be set to public instead of private. The dupe never had the timing notes attached to it, which made it easy to delete. All of the dupes I deleted eventually made their way back. Also would enter info (weight, steps) from other apps multiple times. Not recommended.

Hi @Shan Viv, thanks for leaving us a review. We have recently fixed this duplication bug, so please update to the newest version of our app and let us know what you think! If you have any suggestions or questions, we would love to hear them at support@azumio.com.

It does not allow to log glucose readings with a corresponding meal or fasting and I no longer see a graph. You ruined a great thing. What a shame after paying 6.99 for it months ago to now have to find another app altogether that does what I need it to and what my Doctor will appreciate.

Not user friendly at all. I paid for the subscription for the year (39.99) and after about a week I was so frustrated and really wondered why they charge anything for this worthless app. When I tried to cancel I had to go through Apple, I never heard anything back from my first request and now when I try to dispute it through resolution center it says non-refundable. Do not waste your money on this

----------------------------------------------------------
What a rip-off. The time stamp for recording food intake does not work. I paid $33.00 for nothing. Oh I f your color blind it won’t work for you. Now comes the worst part. When you paid for the one year it then let’s you know that it will be recurring. I have never written a review like this before and if I can’t get better information before I purchase another app for diabetes then I won’t buy it.

----------------------------------------------------------
This is a case of getting what you pay for.  I downloaded and waited (then waited and waited and waited some more) for my activation email that would have allowed me to use the app.  It never came.  I sent a note to their help account and guess what?  No reply.  Given the buzz in some communities about not being able to sync to web servers, I'm thinking the developers have abandoned this app.

Used it for years, was simple, fast, kept track of what I needed. Then it changed to the subscription mode and became too buggy. Popup ads, simple info input became hard, pressing saved button diverts to inappropriate websites. Posted numbers were changed on saved. Steps no longer saved on correct days. No longer able to sync info between devices. Looking for replacement app.

There is no need for the developers to remove that information. If you want to update this app, write your numbers down with a pen and paper first. I wish I had known this was going to happen.

Title: To expensive
----------------------------------------------------------
Nice app the details read barcode reading system for carbs everything about this app I love, except for being a disabled veteran trying to live on Social Security with diabetes and its expenses, $60 a year is beyond my budget.

Title: Syncing issues
----------------------------------------------------------
It will not sync more often than not. Under "diagnostics and usage" on my iPhone, it says it has a bug.  Support does not respond to emails. If it would work, I would give it 5 stars because I like everything else about it.

Title: New Version is a mess
----------------------------------------------------------
I loved the old version, it was easy to read and manage. The new one is way too busy. Adds Adds Adds. Pay to get rid of them and you still have a chunky interface. Very poor "upgrade" that no longer syncs to the website.

Title: DO NOT BUY THIS APP!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was completely disappointed that this app doesn't have a built in food list. Can't wait until I get my money back. I purchased the Diabetes app instead. It is blue with a red blood drop in  the middle. Much better app.

Title: App won’t work!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been reading the good reviews and I was looking forward to trying the app unfortunately it won’t load or stay open.  It keeps shutting down.  I want this to work as it looks like it is exactly what I’m looking for!
