Title: Extremely useful
----------------------------------------------------------
I disagree with what some reviewers are saying about this app being misleading.  It is accurate in telling you what you should avoid according to YOUR preferences you input. While there may be some things on here that will score ok that you wouldn't eat because of GMO's or additives and things like that. But if you are a super naturalist you don't need an app to know that the most "clean" foods are organically grown produce from local farms and non caged and well fed animals for meats. HOWEVER this app is used for scanning PACKAGED foods!! And the reality is, although we are more health conscious than ever, most companies can't keep up with demand w/o some unfavorable preservative ect. So that being said, I've found this app extremely useful!! The scanning feature easy and fun. It's helped me stay away from gluten and from there you can determine if something they suggest is ok for you particularly. Totally worth it app. I've never used a nutrition/food shopping app more. :)

Title: Awesome decoding food app!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Love that this app is able to let you know if a product has harmful preservatives without you needing a degree in nutritional science to figure it out.   Also, it gives you examples of every type of food that you could think of that would best match your health requirements or simply scan an item's barcode to find out, so convenient.  Another great idea was the coloring/numbering system that tells you where a particular food weighs in, in terms of whether or not it is the right food choice for you.  So whatever your diet situation needs are like avoiding foods with certain allergens, avoiding foods because of high blood pressure or certain diseases, or just to be health conscious and savvy to maintain general health this is a really great tool for all these.

Title: Great for celiacs!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am newly diagnosed with celiac disease and in learning to navigate my new gluten free world, this app has been a god-send! Those of us who are really sensitive to cross-contamination obviously still need to double check labels, but this makes it so much easier to find the red flags. I have only found one error so far - this app says M&Ms are NOT gluten free (it highlights dextrin as the source of gluten), but according to every Internet forum, plain M&Ms made on a dedicated line are gluten free. Still waiting to hear from the company about the source of their dextrin. Otherwise, ShopWell has been immensely helpful and makes shopping fun! Great way to not only avoid allergens, but also to eat healthily in the process!

Title: Great App, It Helps Me a Lot
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using this app for about a month now and I have to say it's one the few apps I use at least three times a week. It's helped me to choose better quality items and avoid items I didn't realize had ingredients that were undermining my goals; and I've been reading the nutritional labels closely. There are a couple things I'd like to see improved. One, a larger database but this app is still pretty new and I know the nutritionists making sure the data that is in the database is correct. Two, and I know this is asking a lot, but if this some how could sync with some of the fitness and health monitoring apps that would be great. Bottom line, if you're wanting to monitor and improve your diet, get it.

Title: Love this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been looking for something like this for a while now! It makes it easy to figure out what to buy at the store, and I found that some of the stuff I was buying wasn't as healthy as I thought. I also discovered some stuff was actually better than I thought! It's great when confronted by so many different brands of the same item, and now I can choose the healthiest choice. I wish it had more store brand items available such as Kroger and Hy-Vee store brands, but I can compare their nutrition info to the name brands. I can vouch that it DOES NOT promote the major brands like the first review states. If your "health" food doesn't rate very high, it's probably because it isn't actually that healthy.

Title: AWESOME!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've used a ton of health-related apps, and this one will be indispensable among them.  Simply tell the app a bit about yourself and your nutritional preferences, and it'll score foods for you based on how well they meet your needs.  You can browse categories, search, or scan your foods (and see what higher scoring options there are).  You can create shopping lists off of it as well... But this isn't really an all-in-one grocery shopping app, in that it doesn't have prices, stores, etc like you can get in an app like Grocery IQ.  I'll use this app to determine which products I should buy, and use a dif app to create my shopping list of those products.  Very cool and well executed idea.

Title: Perfect!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is perfect. Not only is it specifically designed for those with food allergies (nuts, dairy, wheat, gluten, etc.) you can customize it to let it tell you what to avoid based on your specific diet needs. So, if you want to avoid foods with high fructose corn syrup, or eat foods high in protein, or avoid foods low in saturated fat, anything specific, then this app does that too! The scanner is fast and accurate, letting you know to "avoid" it and why or letting you know if the food is good for you based on your diet/allergies. It will even rate the food for you on a percentage scale and gives you better suggestions to increase what it is you want to intake more of!

Title: Great App for food searching!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app lets you search for food and look at the nutrition, ingredients, and benefits it will have or not have for you, based on a personal profile that you create about yourself. You pick what you want in food (protein, calcium, low fat, etc.) and what you don't want (sugar, sat. fat, sodium, etc), so can find out if that food you're looking for is healthy or not, and if it isn't then there are healthier alternatives available for you to look at and learn about. This is a great app for shopping, learning. It helps teach you more about what's in the food you eat. I recommend this app, I use it when I'm curious about buying food, whether it's candy or a type of yogurt.

Title: Absolutely Wonderful!
----------------------------------------------------------
Shop Well has created a great app! I love the ease of being able to pick out the sneaky hidden ingredients just by scanning a product! I can't always read the product lists nor know what some of the ingredients are listed as. This has been a godsend for myself & my family! Even close friends have use this when buying products for me & my children who are very restricted on what they can eat due to allergies. The best part is it keeps getting better as more people submit photos of products....so thankful to just have to snap a photo & submit VS manually put in all the info ourselves......Shop Well, you are wonderful! My daughter loves to use it while we shop as well!

Any app that makes life simple by means of removing stress from our lives to allow us to spend more time on what makes us not only happy but healthy is exceptional and a must have app.  This food app allows you tailor your nutritional needs, provides great quick info and a graded score to quickly let you know if an item is a go or no good.  Plus it provides badges for accomplishments who doesn't love rewards. Speaking of rewards, this app offers missions which will potentially offer such items as gift cards.  Aside from these fun highlights, the app offers a wide array of many useful features and benefits that you just have to down load and explore for yourself.

Title: Addicted!
----------------------------------------------------------
I can’t tell you exactly how much I LOVE this app. With a gluten intolerance, I’m finally able to find all the foods that don’t have gluten! I love the scan option so I can quickly scan the ingredients label instead of having to read the entire thing hunting for the words, “gluten”, “wheat”, “rye”, or “barley”. The app tells me if the product contains gluten with one easy scan and I love that. I noticed, too, that in searching for foods, the app won’t even show me foods containing gluten at all which makes my list way easier to look through. I love they scoring system that tells me which foods are healthier as which aren’t.

I don’t write reviews often but this app is a game changer! It is changing my life while possibly saving my life or at the very least my health! I have developed allergies later in life and having successfully raised a child with food allergies I thought I knew what I was in for but my allergies are so different and so much more complex that I knew I needed help. This is the best app I have found for people suffering from food allergies. It is capable of alerting you to allergens not listed on the label which is where I was finding myself in trouble. Thank you so much for this life saving app!!!!

Title: Absolute blessing for shopping with new food allergies
----------------------------------------------------------
I was recently diagnosed with Celiacs disease, lactose intolerance, soy intolerance and placed on a low fodmap diet after being extremely sick for years. My doctor recommended this app to help me shop for foods I can eat rather than trying to google 100s of those crazy ingredients and it has been the best experience. This app has most products (even super obscure brands) so it is very easy to use. It even identifies which ingredients are the ones containing my food allergies! It has made recovering so much easier and I will be using this for as long as it's around. Literally the best app ever.

Title: Essential to making healthier choices while meal planning!
----------------------------------------------------------
I selected my health goals, food intolerances, and food allergies from the settings menu and not only did this application clearly rate the products I scanned conveniently on my phone from 0-100% aligned with my health goals, it also included easy to see color coding with red being the worst choices for me and green the best.  Obeying the little red stop signal kept inferior foods out of my cart and guided me to select healthier alternatives suggested by the application! I love this application.  It worked well even though my Hy Vee store isn't on their list of stores yet.

My husband and I use this app constantly and it's changing how we shop and eat! It's so easy and fast and helps us make MUCH better choices. He has an intolerance for corn and nuts because of a digestive issue and it's so much faster for him to find products he should avoid AND better choices the app suggests. I try to avoid sugar and I've been amazed at how many foods in the grocery store have added sugar. My favorite part is the better suggestions. It doesn't just tell you to avoid a product; it suggests better, healthier ones. They're usually on the same shelf!

Title: Great app to find healthy food!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is an amazing app that will help you find healthy food. The most important benefit I get from Shopwell is the ability to search on virtually any type of food and discover which brands score well for me and which do not. For example - who knew that something like ground meat could score a 92 or a 12 depending on its brand?! (30g of fat in 4oz versus 4.5g from another brand).  WOW!! This app is awesome if you care about what you eat. You can scan items directly in the store, and find out which products are healthy for you.  I love it, thank you shopwell!!!

I have been looking for an app like this for over a year!!

There are a few items from the natural foods store, it would be nice tone able to enter them manually when necessary. Also the ability to transition the lists into actual healthy recipes could take this app to the next level. I have never written a review before, this app deserves the credit!! Great work!

I never, and I mean never, rate apps. It's just such a hassle but this app hands down deserves 5 stars. I would even go to the point to rate it 6 stars. It's the ultimate healthy app. You put in what you prefer in your diet & what you want to disclose from it & then helps you with your grocery list. Like I tend to love ice cream and desserts and it'll show me a healthier option that matches my preference but still satisfies my sweet tooth. This is a beautifully designed app and I am truly impressed with it. Great job guys. I'm very pleased.

Please help the the other 500,000 other apps out there that don't work! :) Changed my life!

I’ve been meaning to learn to build a better relationship with what i eat daily. My schedule doesn’t really allow me to cook, so my focus moved onto what kind of food/product I consume. I was struggling with my new goal, but discovering Shopwell changed my game. Shopwell makes it super easy for me to know which product I can trust and consume, knowing that it is good for me. I’d love to know more about how my score is calculated, but so far so good, have been loving their recommendations and been feeling good with how my body feels.

I recently had lap band surgery done and am on a low sugar,low fat, high protein diet. Being able to program in my special dietary needs and scan through the rating system is a God send for someone who previously had no clue how to eat healthy. Even when cooking something not so healthy I can still find the most healthiest ingredients to make a meal. The grocery list is a huge help in keeping track of what I need to buy. I have had this app for one week and have already recommended it to several friends who are delighted with it!

I had 3 people ask me what app I was using. Our kids even loved using it to scan their food and instantly started making better decisions! We also have a daughter with a food allergy and that was incredible to instantly see things we did not know had some of these allergies in them! Love this app!!!

Very helpful App. Love all the ways you can find ANY item out there. Also like that you can see the nutrition facts and ingredients. This is a good App even just to compare foods when you need to with the healthier option and yet have little time (or patience) in supermarket to stand there and try to read labels, this does it for you in advance, and then you can add the items to a list to know exactly which one you need to just grab off te shelf (with the exception of price comparisons...) I recommens this App.

I truly LOVE this app and couldn't live without it. I have celiac disease and can not eat gluten. If I want to eat it and it does not say gluten free I scan the items bar code and it instantly tells me if it's safe for me to eat. Omg I can't say enough about this app, I could go and on. It's easy to set up to your health needs and if they don't have a particular product you take a picture and they will work on adding it. AMAZING app that I'm using as we speak to check on a candy bar. ❤️ this app. Thank you.

So don't listen to those people who gave it one star. This thing is a life saver. just take your time and learn to use it.

This app is one of those apps that had me saying, "Wow! What a smart idea," when I first used it. In practice it's turning out to be very useful and helps me plan my weekly meals according to my weight loss plans and exercise/health goals. My only complaint is that it doesn't recognise the two closest grocery stores - which are chains and not local. This makes for some uncertainty on whether or not the store will have exactly what I've added to my list. Other than that, wonderful.

I have celiac disease and am very sensitive to any amount of gluten. Shop well has made it so that if there is a product which I am not sure is gluten free, I can scan it and it will tell me. Also, for awhile I was on a low FODMAP diet and Shopwell gives you the option to select that so it will avoid certain foods. If you have any allergy, are on any type of diet, or want to manage special types of vitamins that you are in taking, I definitely recommend this app!

I just got this app, I have only scanned two items, one I knew was going to be good for me, here is what I didn't like. If I scan a cereal that isn't good for my diet, why would it suggest a whole grain pizza and not another cereal that would be good? Would make sense to suggest something in the same category that you are scanning. I like it otherwise and believe that it will be helpful in losing weight and staying away from lactose.

Your app has been a God send for me. I have recently been placed on a very restrictive diet for 3 months. It may work out permanently. It was so frustrating shopping for food and reading labels.

I literally had a melt down in the store and started crying when I had spent two hours reading labels and had nothing in the cart to eat.

The app seems like it is still a work in progress. But it is a great tool for checking what ingredients are in line with your health needs, as you dictate in setting your profile. The categories of menu items to avoid or items you want to include in your diet are a bit too broad for me. With some tweaking, this app will help to eliminate  anymore wasted time on fact-searching for products at grocery stores!!!!

Title: Great Service!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was immensely pleased with the overall service. The app allows you to filter out foods based in dietary preferences, restrictions, or needs. They offer health tips as well. When I chose to delete my account, the response was very friendly (and sent after less than 24 hours, which is pretty quick to me). If you need information on what to shop for as you're shopping, this app is definitely helpful.

Title: This app should cost $100+
----------------------------------------------------------
We have an 11 year old with EOE.  He started to vomit after every meal. We took him to a specialist, put him on multiple drug strategies.  None of them worked. Worked with his nutritionist, got the Elimination-Diet no(dairy, soy, eggs, wheat, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish). We were lost until our nutritionist told us about the app. It gives us so many options including less expensive stores.

----------------------------------------------------------
I hate going grocery shopping!! After deciding to go wheat free to help with intestinal pain, this app actually prompted me to take a trip to the grocery store! It was so easy to scan items and see if they were wheat free or not. I added animal by-products among ingredients to avoid and was shocked to see how many food items I buy regularly that contain animal by-products. That's just gross.

This app helps my mom and I pick out the right foods at the grocery store. I noticed lots of false advertising and being only 10 years old I find this app very impressive. I noticed lots of foods our family usually eats has HIGH SODIUM and TRANS FATS. I recommend this app to anyone who is trying to eat healthier, controlling weight management or just looking for the right foods. Thank you. 😊

You always think you know what you are buying at the store...to do it correctly you could be there for hours reading every label...exhausting. Shopping the perimeter of the market is easy...fruit/vegetables-good, meat-keep it lean, bakery-whole grain or keep on walking, dairy-low fat & watch the sugar...This makes healthy food shopping easy especially when purchasing packaged foods. Try it!

I can go to the grocery store and just scan something i don't know if gluten free and it will pop up and say "avoid" you just put in what your allergic to,  for example : nuts or dairy (etc) and it will tell you avoid the product. It is amazing and so wonderful. A lifesaver! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP!!!!!

I love this app! It has really opened my eyes to see what foods I was feeding my family. It is so easy (and fun) to adjust your personal/family diet settings, and then search for products that match what you are looking for. When you open the app, it automatically shows several products that are good matches for you.

Title: Wonderful.
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is amazing. I only wish you could have multiple user accounts to click between so that I could find foods applicable to all individuals in my family instead of just for myself. Also maybe an element that shows what fruits and veggies are in season.  Though, I am quite amazed with the app simply as it is.

Title: Like it a lot.
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using ShopWell since January and I really like it. I have found a lot of new foods to try that have less sodium (hubby has high blood pressure). and had no idea how much hidden sugar was in regular food. Now I'm obsessed to get my sugar stats down each week. Definitely a good app for grocery shopping.

Title: Best ever
----------------------------------------------------------
This is not only my "go to app", I use this app so much I seldom log out.  My eating life style is to eat only natural unprocessed foods.  What an eye opener this app was!  When I shop I use the scanner and my list to make purchases. This prevents me from taking home a bad choice that I would end up eating later.

Title: Great App
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a wonderful and very informative app. I use it all the time now. My daughter was just diagnosed with Celiacs so this is very helpful. The only thing I would like to see added would be personal hygiene products. Shampoo and lotions and such also have gluten. Would love to see a category for this as well.

Title: Tostitos
----------------------------------------------------------
When I used your app to scan Tostito's Restaurant Style chips it told me I could not have them because of soy. It was not listed on the back of the bag so I called Frito Lay. Frito Lay said that as of May they have pulled all soybean out of these chips. Just wanted to let you know!  Otherwise this app is great!

Title: Great incredibly helpful ap!
----------------------------------------------------------
I use this app because I have to eat gluten-free.  it's so incredibly helpful when I'm at the store to scan a barcode and it (the app) immediately tell me whether or not the product has gluten in it as opposed to be reading through all the ingredients I highly recommend this if you were on a restricted diet
