Title: Disappointed, upset, and $30 poorer than I was before YAZIO
----------------------------------------------------------
I feel like this app wouldn‚Äôt be a bad app, but it definitely isn‚Äôt worth the $30 that I accidentally paid to have a yearly subscription. I was scrolling through the instructions for the app mindlessly because I was tired after a long day. All of a sudden the Face ID screen popped up, I thought it was a little weird, but I was tired so I automatically double clicked the power button. Then a message appeared thanking me for my purchase... I was shocked to find out that the app had charged me $29.99 for a ‚Äúpro‚Äù subscription. I looked around the app thinking maybe the pro subscription would be beneficial, but I was wrong. The pro subscription is something you could get on another app for free, so I contacted the app‚Äôs support to try to get a refund. The company replied saying that I had made a binding contract with them, so they couldn‚Äôt refund my accidental purchase. The response from customer service was also very automated, I doubt a living person actually read my concern. Anyway, I‚Äôm upset that I paid 30 whole dollars for nothing special. I DO NOT recommend this app to anyone. Find another free app that doesn‚Äôt trick you into giving them money :)

Title: So disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
I wish there had been a free trial available before purchasing a subscription. I chose this out of all the apps because it was the only one that counted both fasting and calories. I was excited to see that there was an updated version which was supposed to address some of the issues I am having. It states that the updated version allows you to customize your fast times. It either does not or I can‚Äôt figure out how to do it. You cannot enter your meal times. The time for the 16:8 skip dinner fast automatically runs from 2:00 pm to 6:00 am. I am not even up at 6:00 am. The most frustrating part of the app is the calorie counter. It is so random. For example, a cup of grapes is listed as 350 calories. Even foods identified by brand are wrong. Not even standard measurements are correct. Sometimes a cup is listed as 4 oz sometimes 3.5, sometimes something else. Last time I checked, a cup is 8 oz. The whole thing is clunky. The only thing I do like is the estimation of weeks left until the weight goal is reached.

Title: Still not adding up....
----------------------------------------------------------
I enjoy the look of the app and the options it has, unfortunately despite working with YAZIO support team, they don‚Äôt seem to understand as a whole the science of burning calories. Your body burns calories all day not just during an active state. But YAZIO only tracks and displays the active calories burned. So if you walked 10 miles in a day, without your heart rate reaching an ‚Äúactive state‚Äù they WILL NOT COUNT IT. Which of course left me with a LOT of calories burned that weren‚Äôt counting on the app so after logging my meals for the day it would turn red and say I‚Äôve eaten over my goal, when in fact I had been eating at too high of a deficit. This is dangerous to eat at too high of a deficit and therefore I find the tracking hazardous. You read that right. You will put your health at risk if you trust this apps calculations. I use a Garmin Venu which displays my active and inactive calories burned. Many other health trackers show this as well. Proceed with caution using this app.

Title: Bad app design, bad plan
----------------------------------------------------------
Confusing, too many words, app can be simplified in approach and layout design.  The meals are ridiculous with recipes that require ingredients 80% of the people won‚Äôt have in their refrigerator or spice rack.  Some recipes even require something called a hokkaido pumpkin.  Where the heck do you find that? Silliness.  If you really want to lose weight you don‚Äôt need an app to tell you what to do.  Do you really want to go to the grocery and buy things for these silly recipes for 1 serving everytime?  Who has time for that.  Bottomline, incorporate more than half of veggies into your meal, avoid sugar best you can.  Eat smaller portions, don‚Äôt over indulge unless its veggies only.  You will lose weight by following this simple plan.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi! If you can't find Hokkaido, we would suggest Butternut squash (although its a bit sweeter) and unlike the Hokkaido, it would be best to remove the skin because it takes longer to cook than the Hokkaido skin. We don't have instructions to remove the skin in our recipes since the Hokkaido skin softens a lot faster when cooking. Kind regards, your YAZIO-Team

Title: Bait and Switch - $30 a year for anything but a calorie tracker
----------------------------------------------------------
Well that was extremely disappointing. I downloaded the app after seeing high review ratings, read the destruction in the App Store, and had seen some options for pro features to pay for 6 months or 12 months, etc.  But after I opened the all and began signing up, low and behold, there is NOTHING accessible in the ‚Äúlimited‚Äù app except a calorie tracker.  Really?!  Then please update your app description because this was very misleading.  No sooner did I enter my email, the app asked me to choose if I wanted the ‚ÄúLimited‚Äù option with calorie tracker only, or if I wanted to pay the $30 a year for the Pro Features (everything worthwhile...). So, no recipes, no meal plans, no statistics tracking, no fitness tracking, no mood tracking.

Title: Not meeting expectations
----------------------------------------------------------
What I really wanted was an app to help me know how many of which macros to eat to build muscle while losing weight. I lift and lift heavy. The only option for building muscle is for gaining or maintaining. I even spent the $ to go premium because it promised to unlock meal plans. The meal plans are complicated. I meal prep and used leftovers and the meal plans all have a completely different meal 3times a day. Nothing that feeds into another meal to save money or time. Also I eat many foods from Whole Foods and almost every time I‚Äôve gone to log I need to create the food. It doesn‚Äôt recognize the barcodes. I just don‚Äôt log or try to find something close to save time. This isn‚Äôt the meal tracking app for my personal needs.

Title: Do Not Buy
----------------------------------------------------------
I purchased this application at 11:51 AM. By 12:15 PM (The same day) I was asking for my money back. If you are a beginner and no nothing this is the perfect app for you. The pro version does nothing is advertised you cannot customize the settings as a relates to fast start and end dates, they are preset. I opened three support tickets with their support. The only ticket they respond to was my final support to get for a refund. And their response for my refund request was to be patient that is taking longer than usual for them to get back to anybody. Oh by the way, their refund policy is that the minute you start using the application you cannot get a refund! This developer is obviously not ready for prime time.

Title: Just Another Diet Scam in App Form.
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm a Registered Dietitian advising you to avoid this app.  The nutrition data is unreliable.  The micronutrient data is missing even after inputting a days worth of food (a painful process), the database is hopeless and the customer service is abysmal.  They hide the full nutrient data behind the pay wall for a reason.  It‚Äôs a deceptive business practice.  They then flat out refused my request for a refund.  I had to go to Apple who refunded me within minutes.  Yazio feel the money grab is worth driving away customers, a complete false economy showing their true values.   Just use MyFitnessPal, it gives you everything you need and more than Yazio, with the very best database, for free.

Title: DO NOT purchase PRO
----------------------------------------------------------
This looked like just the app I needed so I enthusiastically downloaded to give it a try. Since a few of the features I wanted were only available in PRO, I went ahead and purchased so I could get the full experience. Unfortunately, after about 3 weeks, I realized this app just wasn‚Äôt what I was hoping for, so I canceled, only to receive a message that my subscription would be available until renewal - NEXT YEAR - and that I can continue to access the PRO features until then. So, yay, I get access to an app that doesn‚Äôt have the features I need for a year...instead of a prorated refund. Terrible policy. Buyer beware.

It doesn‚Äôt say anywhere that you have to pay $ to use the app before you download it. I have not been able to find any useable free content since downloading. Everything points me to a pro membership in order to do anything on this app. If there is free content, it is not obvious and very difficult to find. You need to make it clear that this is not a free app before people download it. There is no obvious free content whether there actually is or not. Update: I have not found anything useable for free. What do you get to use for free and how do you access the free content?

Title: Not great
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve used MyFitnessPal, LoseIt and Yazio and Yazio is the worst of the bunch. The food database is the smallest by far so I find myself having to add food more often than not. On top of that, the foods that are in the database almost always have incorrect serving / portion sizes. This may be because the interface for entering a new food is really weird and bad. It seems impossible to have the app understand what a serving is. And, if you enter one incorrectly (due to the bad interface, probably) and make it public, there is no option at all to edit or remove it.

Title: Horrible app don‚Äôt try
----------------------------------------------------------
They make you think you HAVE to subscribe. I didn‚Äôt see any option to not subscribe to pro. So I thought I‚Äôd give it a try. The description sounded great. But the recipe ingredients look really simple and not very good at all, the timer for when to eat and when to stop is nice but certainly not worth the pro subscription and their food management system needs some serious work! I have no idea how many oz of half and half I used in my tea this morning, but I do know how many tbs!  There is just a serious lack in options.

There isn‚Äôt any place on this app for cancelling. Now they have charged me for another year that I do not want because I can‚Äôt find any button or sentence to CANCEL. Their ‚Äúhelp section ‚Äú was not helpful. There is also no way to contact this app. Now as to the app itself,  I agree with the other subscribers that the food database is too elemental. The other complaint is most of the recipes and foods are in ounces or grams. This is unfamiliar to those of us who use the decimal, teaspoon and cup method of measurement.

Pretty much a completely useless app unless you pay for the subscription. There are other free apps that allow you to more without getting the subscription. Can't set up the intermittent fasting without paying. Can't use a fitness tracker without paying. Deleted my account after less than 5 minutes trying it out. I'll bet you have to pay to use the scanner to scan food. Why even offer this as a free app of you're just going to make people pay to get even basic functionality. What a despicable company.

Title: App needs lots of work!
----------------------------------------------------------
Confusing to add food to a personal list of food. Needs a separate tab that allows you to create personal food items. Needs a better conversion tool. Cannot delete a food after you‚Äôve created it to your personal list of foods. Adds exercise calories lost into food calories eaten which makes no sense. Automatically recommends % of calories per meal which is unnecessary, should be an option to opt out of that. I wish I hadn‚Äôt paid for this app! Needs lots of tweaking and clarifications.

Title: Poor food tracking
----------------------------------------------------------
This app was very frustrating. It could be a great app, but you can‚Äôt change the measurement of the food you are adding. Everything seems to only be added in oz increments. For example, if I want to add one egg, it doesn‚Äôt have an option to add one egg, just ozs. Even when their food database has the item, say a single serve packaged item, you can‚Äôt just add one package, you have to figure out the ozs. I really wish I hadn‚Äôt wasted the $29.99 on the year premium subscription.

I really wanted to like this App. I originally got it as an alternative to MyFitnessPal.

Title: Had the app for going on two weeks
----------------------------------------------------------
Really terrible app. Most nutritional information is wrong and you have to enter it by hand. There is no editing.  It doesn‚Äôt have a LOT of foods, or it has three or for of the same bar codes with different values so the recommendation is to make your own list.  Bottom line, not user friendly, manually intensive, a nightmare to try to figure out. Not worth it.

Hi! Thanks for your feedback. We are currently putting a lot of effort in correcting wrong food items. Soon it will also be possible to report wrong entries in the app. Kind regards, your YAZIO-Team

Title: Do not use if you expect a database of restaurants.
----------------------------------------------------------
The database for YAZIO is ridiculous. If you think that you‚Äôll be able to add foods from the store or from a restaurant, you‚Äôll be mistaken. They don‚Äôt even have protein bars or lean box meals. It‚Äôs nothing that you‚Äôre looking for. That may change some day, but for now, keep looking for something else. Have requested a refund because it‚Äôs completely useless.

I paid for a subscription thinking the coach would be worth it. It‚Äôs just a dumb collection of meals with insane categorization - they call baking your own pita bread for a recipe ‚Äúnormal effort.‚Äù The notifications they send are random and unhelpful. It will say stuff like, ‚ÄúDinner- always a good time for fruit,‚Äù at noon. Really bummed with this purchase.

Title: Database is way off
----------------------------------------------------------
Not only is the database lacking many foods, it‚Äôs way off on the information it gives on the food it does have. The calories, fat and carbs are all wrong. Plus, sometimes if you try to put a low or no carb food into it manually the app doesn‚Äôt understand the nutritional value and doesn‚Äôt allow you to enter it. Good luck trying to enter low carb beer

Defaults to ounces and grams for everything. I manually added a pizza, the serving size was slices/pieces, and then after I put in all the details I tried to add a service but it was in grams. Like no??? Everything is like this too. Not user friendly, and the fact that they set it up like this to begin with means it can probably never be fixed.

Hi! When creating foods, you are always able to define the default serving as well as additional servings. Do you still have any issues with that? Please do not hesitate to send us an email with more details. Then we can look into it. Best regards!

Hi, if the meal plan does not show a great variety of foods, you might have selecte too many filter options. In this case, the app does not yet have enough recipes to fill your plan. Sorry for that!

Title: Very disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
Bought the PRO version and then discovered that the IOS version does NOT allow you to scan barcodes for your food choices. This is the only reason I purchased it and hope I am able to get my money back.

Title: Cannot Alter Fasting Days
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought this to track my fasting days (5:2) and gain helpful recipes. However, the app forces you to follow the rotating schedule they provide. I like to do the same two days to avoid weekend fasting.

Hi there, thanks for your feedback and sorry for the inconvenience! Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to change the fasting days individually, sorry! However, you can influence the fasting days depending on which day you start with the plan. Kind regards, your YAZIO-Team

Title: Not what I expected for the price.
----------------------------------------------------------
Too many food items with incorrect calorie counts.  Free weight loss apps such as my fitness pal are 100% better.  I am quite disappointed that I spent so much money on this app and can‚Äôt get a refund.

Hi, we are constantly improving the database. Unfortunately, some foods in the database might have wrong information, if a user made a mistake when entering the food. Sorry for the inconvenience! Soon it will be possible to edit or report those wrong entries in the app. You can always recognize our verified entries by the green checkmark. It's also possible to create your own foods. Kind regards, your YAZIO-Team

Title: Everything is wrong
----------------------------------------------------------
There needs to be someone checking entries. Mainly for fast food and restaurants. If I wanted to do the research and log it myself I wouldn‚Äôt have this app. I‚Äôd useable food journal. Waste of money

Title: Calorie tracking not good
----------------------------------------------------------
Calorie tracking is not nearly as robust as other apps. Even when you scan a product often the item that shows up does not have the correct nutrition facts. However, some of the recipes were nice

Hi, thanks for your feedback! We are currently putting a lot of effort in correcting wrong food items. Soon it will also be possible to report wrong entries in the app. Best regards, your YAZIO-Team

Title: Can‚Äôt customize fast days

So if I‚Äôm on the 5-2 plan I have to fast on Saturdays and can‚Äôt customize that? Sorry, that‚Äôs lame and unusable. Who wants to fast on the weekend when they‚Äôre enjoying time with family?

This looks like a rebranded Lifesum with the added annoyance of a very limited food database. I don‚Äôt eat uncommon foods, however I‚Äôve had about a 20% success rate at logging my meals

Title: I hate this app
----------------------------------------------------------
Calories for foods are all off. Database for scanning food is worthless. Awful UX - Hard to navigate, not intuitive and so difficult find what you need. I want my money back.

Title: Can't edit the start of a fast when it started yesterday when I went to bed.
----------------------------------------------------------
It won't let me edit earlier than today and I don't know why it didn't track it when I hit the fast button. If it decided that it's just incorrect by default, that's crappy.

Title: I regret paying for the premium plan!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using MyFitnessPal for a long time. I have also been stuck at the same weight for a long time. I thought the change of program might help me get going again.
