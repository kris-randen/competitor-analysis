Title: Just bad
----------------------------------------------------------
I gave in and decided to try out Noom. Didn’t get past a couple of days on the trial. I’ll give you my experience and let you decide for yourself. I gave my weight goal at the beginning of the questionnaire (before purchasing a trial subscription) which is a substantial number, and I was told by Noom that it could get me to my goal weight by December this year if “I believed it.” December, I thought, would be incredible and insane. This is also after I told Noom that I wanted my weight loss to be gradual and long term, not a quick one. Then, I actually paid and enrolled in the trial, and Noom told me that it could help me get to my goal weight by AUGUST now. If “I believed.” 55 pounds by August, starting in mid April. Do the math. That’s extremely unhealthy, especially for someone like me who has a disordered eating past. THEN when I check my weight progress after I weighed-in, it tells me that my goal weight - which I did not input - is 12 pounds LESS and will get there by late August. Noom will have me lose nearly 70 pounds in just three months without surgery and I’m assuming by just drinking water and starving myself. This goes hand-in-hand about “scale anxiety.” Noom will pretend to be empathetic in its little articles you are required to read, and say that while scales aren’t always the best way to determine weight loss and health, and while weight fluctuates from day to day and even throughout the day (which is all true!), that users still need to weigh in every single day and follow that number for “progress.” This could be bad for people with eating disorders or recovering from eating disorders/disordered eating. While Noom thinks it’s telling you a lot, it’s also not. It tells you to drink more/enough water for you and that the amount to drink is different for everyone, but that drinking the right amount is important. And then tells you to give yourself a water goal. Do you know how much water you should be drinking? I don’t. I thought Noom would be helpful, but they’re not. The same thing with its food guidelines. Noom markets on “still being able to eat a cookie” and not being restrictive. And then will tell you not to eat relatively healthy food like avocado or almond milk. Don’t even have a skinny latte, a “treat” because that’s also not recommended even though the ads say you’re “allowed.”  You can’t have a color scheme like green, yellow and red and say “it doesn’t mean these are necessarily bad foods” even though everyone knows what those colors represent in general. Another thing is that Noom will keep pushing you to purchase add-ons or skip the trial session and go straight to purchasing a 7-month subscription for nearly $200 without you having an opportunity to find out if you actually like the program. It did this 3 times in a row after I said no. Stupid and disappointing. I should know better than to fall for trendy diet fads but I thought Noom would be better. It’s not. Go see an actual licensed nutritionist.

Title: I really wanted to like Noom
----------------------------------------------------------
I really did.  In fact, I wanted to like it so much I bought the subscription, cancelled it, then months later bought another subscription.  When I first bought the subscription, it was really expensive, I can’t recall how much, but enough for me to message and tell them to cancel.  At which point they offered me a less expensive plan, which I took, then cancelled.  Fast forward to a couple of months ago when I decided I would try it again.  I bought the subscription before my long vacation, knowing I wouldn’t track anything, but was prepared to start fresh when I returned.  Three weeks later I get home only to find my app was on week three and there was no way for me to start on day one again.  I tried for a couple of weeks to read a few days’ worth of lessons, etc per day, but that quickly became a massive obstacle.  I tried to reset it to day 1 and that wasn’t possible.  Wow! Really? I was paying $45 PER MONTH for nothing! MyFitnessPal is a much easier app to use.  The “coaches” or “trainers” or whatever they call them in this app are a serious joke - don’t even try to message them in real time, you will be sorely disappointed to not get any replies the same day.  Try like a week later! What the heck was I paying for again? Food logging is seriously the worst I have seen across apps.  Although I paid the extortionate monthly rate, I never did have access to my “group”, so I can’t begin to even know what that would have been like.  Their database of food is “decent” but I encountered a few foods that had the wrong information, calories, etc - completely contradictory to the label on the food.  I tried to inform a coach, but got a big “nothing I can really do about it”.  Which is MADDENING.  Along with inconsistent nutrition information, the way you select amounts of each food is like a guessing game.  Some foods you can do by weights, some cups, and handfuls? HAHA are you serious? How the hell is a “handful” a scientific measurement.  Because if I’m restricted to 1200 calories per day, they CLEARLY want me to abide by that rule, and to have an ambiguous “handful” of food seems ludicrous.  On a whole, I liked the daily information.  I massively dislike the cost, the “coaching” seems like a miss - just leave them out of the equation as a whole.  The group would have been nice to meet other people along my same path.  The food database needs to get better and more accurate.  They need to make this app more user friendly and not so bulky.

So sorry for the confusion! The program begins the same day that you sign up. Additionally, to reset your curriculum to day 1, you just need to let your goal specialist know. Do you mind reaching out to us with your Noom account details at reviewsupport@noom.com so that we can look into this? Thanks!

Title: Such an amazing idea, but so disappointing
----------------------------------------------------------
I LOVED this app when I first started. Everything about it was exactly what I needed. Especially when they sell you on the idea of 1:1 sessions with a goal specialist. But when I first met the goal specialist, I didn’t really “meet” him. They call it psychology and make it sound like you’re going to have a one on one conversation. Instead, he basically left me messages saying to log meals. Okay, well that’s great but I already log all my meals. I wanted to talk about a goal for me, something I could try. Regardless, I waited until the following week. When he finally messaged me (3 days after the day he told me would reach out), I tried catching him asking if we could set up specific times to have our meeting so that I can be prepared to talk about what I was doing well in or poorly with. I wanted to have an actual conversation so we could talk and discuss some things I did well and others I could work on and how to work on them. Instead, he relied “sure sounds good. I’ll check back in with you next Monday”. So not only did you ignore my question, you wouldn’t set up a time to talk with me, and now you want me to wait till next week to discuss my issues? So I’ve lost ANOTHER week with no goal? Nothing discussed? They don’t actually want to talk you through issues! They just want to say something so that they can say they touched base each week. Finally, when I messaged him saying I had concerns and I felt like what this app promised was not being delivered. I told him I loved the program but I didn’t know if I would continue if i couldn’t have a conversation with the goal specialists. Instead of responding to my concerns, apologizing, or literally anything, HE JUST WENT AHEAD AND CANCELLED MY SUBSCRIPTION WITHOUT ASKING ME. I was genuinely thinking about still staying with the program but apparently these people don’t need the business. I don’t think I’ve ever taken the time out to write anyone a negative review because I know we’re all just trying our best here, but if this saves anyone the headache, please be cautious. Use the free version of the app. They have some really good stuff. But don’t waste your money. You can spend it on pretty work out clothes like I plan to...or a better program or healthy food for a month or two.

Title: Save your money!
----------------------------------------------------------
I will admit, when I started the program I found instant weight loss and I even felt encouraged to keep going (15 down). At a month and half a family emergency that took me away from my regular health plan and lead to a strenuous time on my diet. I fell out for about a week and a half. When I got back I reached out to my support coach, who I pay a lot of money for. You will do should you choose to pay for the subscription that you need to actually do the program… and they weren’t there for me. They respond to weeks apart, not at all, or would tell me that they would get back to me. No help. In fact, the most help I got was when I finally asked for the cancellation instructions. They helped me with that quickly and I was impressed, but I was disappointed because I actually enjoyed the program and it felt like I was learning a lot. I just needed help. The hallmark of this app and this program is that they are there to help you when you need it and you can get real time support from a human. Unfortunately, this is a scam. They aren’t there for you. They may be treating some psychological damage and see your diet habits, but their long-term improvements are not there. They don’t care about you as an individual and these health communities they’re building do  not justify the irresponsibility and lack of interface. In fact, the only time I’ve ever talked to my group leader was when I formerly second my goodbyes to my group. I have reached out before, but she did not care. It wasn’t until I was leaving rest of the group know how I felt. She finally got involved wish me well they also beg me to stay. This app, this program, is far too expensive. Please save yourself the money and try any other program. As someone who made it fairly deep into the program, I will tell you the secret is calorie deficit and try to up your overall intake of water. What I mean is consume less calories, then what you were burning in a day. And I’ll take the intake of water, just switch out dried foods or starchy foods. I.e. raisins for grapes or plant-based pasta for regular pasta. That’s the Way to go, and that’s the way I’ll stay.

Title: Just Rewrapped Garbage
----------------------------------------------------------
I did Noom and got some good things out of what they were saying about the psychology of eating but they are simply taking the old mantra of “eat less!”, wrapped pop-psychology around it, and sell it to you for too much money.  Noom is not interested in health, they are interested in selling their way of approaching food.  My coach was amazing but as I continued along the path the lessons were clearly redundant and geared towards women, and as a man they were not helpful.  I wish they would make that abundantly clear at the beginning.  Lastly, their article in April regarding Dr Joel Fuhrman totally convinced me they are not scientists or open-minded people seeing the truth as they claim: they simply push calorie-counting.  Their program works while you are on it but when did we as humans decide that the only way to eat healthy is to have a coach and support tam around us?  Nothing in Noom frees the individual to really understand what food is and how it works in the body.  They do not help cure disease or improve a person’s life, they just help you count calories and try to lose weight.  You may as well buy a notebook, log your meals, and see a counselor.  It’s rubbish.  Utter rubbish.  If the person who wrote that article would have simply read the introduction and part of the first chapter to “Eat for Health” they would never have written the article as it was and Noom might actually start to help people get healthy because it would actually synergize with Dr Fuhrman’s eating style (it is NOT a temporary diet as Noom falsely, slanderously claims).  Rubbish.  Save your money and read “Eat for Health”.  I’m back following it and will it go back to Noom because Noom is just another Weight Watchers or other temporary diet gimmick.  Save your money.  And by the way, I brought all this up to my coach some time ago and was directed to give feedback on Noom’s site...but they only allow 500 characters so clearly they are not interested in feedback.  Talk is cheap, Noom!  Your coaches are awesome, I’m just sad that such great people got suckers into peddling your trash.

Title: Taking Advantage of People
----------------------------------------------------------
I am a fitness professional (personal trainer) and downloaded Noom because a few of my clients were interested in it so I checked it out.  It says you will have a free trial but then just before giving you your personalized program you learn it is $50 a month basically after the first month and they want your credit card right away.  I think similar services are absolutely worth this amount but the reality is, if you need to loose weight you are better off seeing an actually registered dietician or nutritional psychologist (or whatever type of psychologist they claim are in the app).  I have tried similar apps that claim it is so personalized but there is only so much personalization that can come from cookie cutter questions through a phone app.  Really not a fan at all. If you are ready to make a change towards you health the best thing you can do is join a gym, make an appointment with their registered dietician and a personal trainer and develop a program together in person.  These actual people will be there to support you every step of the way. Some people will say they cannot afford to be a member at facilities like this, and they are justified in that point, it is expensive.  Most gyms with these amenities are higher scale/more expensive gyms, not planet fitness.  However, most of these clubs do not require you to be a member to be seeing their Registered Dietician and the cost of sessions is typically similar to the app. At my club it is $85 a month for anyone to meet with the RD and have a monthly plan.  Your health is an investment, I fully believe that,  but an app format will never be as good as in person and I do not think they are justified in charging so much for this service.  I feel they are taking advantage of desperate people who are ashamed to actually seek help so they spend way to much money on a service they can receive passively from their phone screen.

Title: Do not even try this!
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded this based on a blog review I read after I saw an ad on Instagram and I thought sounds good, sounds like it might work. so I downloaded it. My experience with their goal specialist has been severely lacking. At the beginning of this app I found maneuvering was user-friendly. Reading the articles was interesting. I was shocked that they charged me $1 for the first 14 days and then they would charge me $150 for the future six months I had come in assuming that I would be charged monthly about $25 which sure you can budget $25 a month but a $150 chunk right off the bat they should be up front about that anyway the second day I decided that it wasn’t really anything that I want really want to pay $150 chunked half of my paycheck so I texted to cancel because that’s the only option they give you to cancel and nobody answered for hours so I sent a second text message with my own timestamps because their messages don’t have timestamps saying that I wanted it canceled within minutes they let me know that it was canceled in the email was sent to me. A few hours later I decided I still want to try this for 14 days I’ll like it give it a fair chance but my goal specialist gave me the kind courtesy of telling me that my services would be pretty much canceled after 5 days even though I’m supposed to have a “free trial” for 14 days. I asked about this and nobody answered me for a whole day I was upset so I texted back to them that I would leave this review and guess what after five minutes, not even; they answered me back letting me know that I only paid one dollar and that the original version is the free version of the app basically letting me know that their advertisements are really a lie, you don’t get 14 days unless you wait until the last minute to cancel and that’s only if somebody cancels it for you in time. if you read their terms they don’t offer refunds.

So sorry for the confusion! The price for a monthly subscription to the Noom Program is $59.99 when you sign up via our website. We are able to apply discounts on our longer plans by charging the full amount at once, as stated on the purchase page. We show a monthly breakdown of the discounted price in addition to the full price you will be charged at the end of the trial to help illustrate the significant discount customers receive by paying for multiple months up front. Unfortunately, we're unable to process cancellations in advance. If you'd like to experience the entire trial, we do recommend cancelling a day before your charge date. Please know that we always issue refunds if you are charged after requesting to cancel prior to the end of your trial. My apologies for the confusion here!

Title: Battery intensive. 25 % of battery Don’t go past Trial
----------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to like this program. It has some great ideas but I’m really surprised at several issues that are poorly designed. I could not understand the constant battery loss of the program. I stopped carrying my phone and the step counter. I used a fit bit but still the battery loss is extraordinarily wrong. They don’t tell you they are charging you for 4 months at a time when you pass the trial. They don’t go to monthly as expected they just charge you one large sum of 130 dollars. That’s ridiculous because if you cancel you get no refund. I can’t find that in their write up. I have to delete the entire program to stop the battery use issue. I can’t be without my phone. But the clincher is they give you no option with which to lessen the battery issue. Less intensive tracking or something else. I’ll use lose it or weight watchers or something else far cheaper. What really annoys me is that a program that supposedly is so geared on psychology totally invalidated their point when they charged me for four months without warning. They write as though they really care about the client but they screw them by not giving alternatives to getting better service. I’m just a few days into this program. I have 4 months I won’t use. The coaching is not reachable unless it’s a week past. They only response you get when you even write the word cancel is a pre written post to click this to cancel. Do not waste your money. Do not sign up for this costly and battery intensive program. I hope more people will write so that they get themselves more in line with what they say they will do. Very disappointing. There are just so many programs that serve you honestly and with less battery use, so many programs to manage your calories and step count and to advise you.  I’m sick about the loss of money that I had no idea I would lose. Do not get it.

Title: Sophomoric and unhealthily restrictive
----------------------------------------------------------
After all the expensive TV ad campaigns, I expected a very polished offering.  Noom has disappointed on so many levels from the start.  The software has a poor user experience...doesn’t sync across devices, tiny fonts and icons, not able to use tablet size display for better visibility, annoying sliders to enter numbers etc.  The much-hyped integration of psychological principles of CBT etc. and education about food choices is delivered in a profoundly irritating format.  It feels as though the target user must be a young teen.  Each mini module is riddled with cutesy comments that aren’t cute, supposed jokes that aren’t funny, endless hashtags getting in the flow of the text, highlighted text, and a flippant and casual tone that really grates after about the first 3 minutes.  Most problematic though for me was the complete lack of transparency about the choice of daily calorie limit and the relationship to levels of activity.  As someone who exercises a lot (and still eats too much of the wrong stuff), the recommended 1200 calories a day would likely have been harmful to my capacity to recover after workouts.  There were no intake questions about level of activity.  My trainer was horrified.  Using a BMR calculator suggested that noom was cutting 1000 calories a day out of my diet which is just plain unsafe.  I posed these questions to my assigned coach and received no response for 3 days until after I rated my experience poorly, and then her comment was, “these are just guidelines”.  So don’t trust the app to guide you in a healthy or personalized way.  I’m going back to Weighwatchers which feels much more supportive in terms of the capacity to choose no point foods when you are hungry and not blow through an overly restrictive calorie count.  And designed for adults with a communication style to match.

Title: Lies Regarding “Calories Over” As If You Need To Be Tricked Into Exercise
----------------------------------------------------------
Lies about calories over as if people actively using an app to lose weight need to be tricked into exercising. So these creeps have decided that if you are trying to lose weight then you must be an unintelligent fatty that needs to be tricked, cause you obviously aren't responsible enough to exercise unless they lie about your calories over. And this is how I found that out: I decided to try this out tonight, so I added everything I had eaten today at once. The tracking bar said I was 150 cal over. So I started searching for exercises and min that would get me there and work for me and burn 150 cal. I entered the info before I did the workout and saw that the 150 over was now gone BUT now it said 70 over. So let me say that again: It said I was 150cal over my calories, I entered an exercise that burns 150cal and now I’m magically 70 cal over. It dragged this dumb crap out until I entered an exercise that burned about 375 calories. Then I was finally NOT over calories anymore and it equaled out. They used that garbage method to try and get me to do JUST 150 and then slyly burn JUST another 70—and the more you try to fix the “over” the more they drag you along until 375 calories later. That doesnt work because I have a day already set out for me so when I see I only need to work off 150 I dont have the time or the patience to play the developers games and drag that out to 375 cal later. Tell me upfront, and give me the data. Some people may shrug off this crap but when you are getting it in before bed and these guys just want to drag out instead of giving info straight forward. Its pathetic. And the second thing that sucked: they dont allow you to add your own calorie limit. So if you want to work your life around a specific amount of calories and track so you dont go over that—you cant.

Title: Waist of time with filler “lessons”
----------------------------------------------------------
I know quite a bit about eating good and healthy. Diabetes runs in my family and I’ve struggles with weight off and on my whole life. Noom was advertised to give support mentally and physically with others that are also on the same journey. I had no support. You do t get support until weeks 3-5. Until then you are flapping in the wind wondering where your drive to do this went. I’m allergic to mushrooms, that’s it, and almost every recipe revolves around mushrooms. There is no explanation about sugars and what it does to your body. All meats are considered red food items (they don’t call it bad, but that’s what it is, we aren’t children Noom). I have a lot of mental skills and while I can see how the skills Noom teaches will help people who didn’t even know they existed, I knew and already implement them but I’m unable to skip any of that. I finished 20 lessons and it congratulated me. 15 of those lessons were empty little nonsense things I assume designed to make people laugh and feel less restricted somehow. But I’m not paying someone to joke with me. The explanation of calorie density makes plenty of sense until you look at it practically. An apple is a green food item. An apple also has loads of sugar, natural sugar, but still sugar. Eating meat that has the same amount of calorie density as an apple keeps you full longer and has no sugar and as long as it’s lean, will not add unwanted fats. An apple will load you up on sugar which is a carb. Carbs are stored, calories, as long as you aren’t exceeding a healthy amount and eating things like McDonald’s all the time, are burned everything you move. Carbs aren’t. And while eating an apple once a day is good for you, wasting them to stay off hunger isn’t at all, you just add more and more sugar to your body and it’s then stored.

Title: Nicely packaged eating disorder
----------------------------------------------------------
It promotes itself as a “lifestyle change, not a diet.” Guess what, if it has you counting calories and avoiding certain foods, it’s a diet. They say the green-yellow-red categories are not to make red foods “bad” but they still have the effect of making you afraid to eat “red” foods that are perfectly healthy and satisfying, like a cheese stick or whole milk. When you go over your meager allotment it gives you a dramatic red triangle with an exclamation point in the middle to make sure you know you failed, even if you stayed within your day’s “calorie budget” and weren’t hungry because you ate mostly a combo of green and red foods and were light on the yellow. Counting every calorie, daily weighing and ignoring true hunger cues because you’re “out of calories” are food-obsessive behaviors and are not healthy especially for those who have struggled with eating disorders, according to REAL #psychology. Those are exactly the things that cause people to eventually fall out of a diet cycle and back into a binge. The “coaching” is canned. It takes sooo long for them to get back to you with a non-answer. The way the quizzes and supplemental info are given is immature and condescending. I’m switching to Intuitive Eating, which is truly NOT a diet, it’s eating disorder recovery. But I guess thanks Noom for triggering all the bad behaviors I had back when I had bulimia and making it clear to me that I still have an eating disorder, just a different one than I used to, and that it needs treatment rather than another diet. DIETS DON’T WORK and this one is just repackaged Volumetrics in a sleek app. I especially would not recommend it for those with an eating disorder but really can’t recommend it for anyone who wants a psychologically healthy relationship with food.

Title: Overpriced & Underwhelming.
----------------------------------------------------------
You are basically paying the price you could spend on a real life coach for a fitness and meal plan, with real coaching so that you can use a MEH food tracking app. They psychological learning is repetitive and not engaging or helpful, the “coaches” feel like boys with responses that are often not personal or even related to the question or “conversation” you are having. There’s no real fitness guidance whatsoever in the mail tracking in calorie tracking portion of the app is overly complicated or not intuitive and free apps like MyFitnessPal or easier to use and accomplish the same goal if not better. For seen the advertisements I had high hopes for this, leaving that perhaps it was a community of coaches and people who give you personal attention, instead it feels more like an online course of repetitive materials with coaches that might be either Ai or machine learning on the back end. If this works for some people that’s great, but the money could be spent better elsewhere and what you get out of this app can be gotten for free through other apps. Like many claim within the first two weeks you do see some significant weight loss, but if you’re somebody who’s already fallen off the wagon and your diet has gone to crap, putting your body into check and eating right for two weeks in any situation will make you lose a fair amount of water weight or any actual weight and it’s just not enough time to get through the trial and realize the true depth, scope, and effectiveness of this program for you individually. The fact that there’s no refund policy is also another big negative for me on this program considering there’s not much about this that feels personal and the meal tracking, in the way they do it, is just handled better elsewhere.

Title: False advertising and potentially dangerous
----------------------------------------------------------
I wouldn’t recommend this program for people in recovery from eating disorder. It’s calorie and step counting with meal and exercise logging, daily weigh-ins, and a focus on low caloric density foods. Based on my health conditions, if I had known any of this before signing up, I wouldn’t have tried it for the week. All the mysterious ads kept saying how revolutionary it is and how different it is from restrictive dieting. Maybe the framework is innovative — the fact that all of these components are integrated in one app with a chatbot and a social function. But the program itself is standard, with basic nutritional education cutesily dispensed on illustrated screens. Their assumption that everyone owns a scale triggered me and put me behind from the start. On the first day of onboarding, one of the tasks was to “get the scale from the closet” and overcome the anxiety to get on it, because I SHOULD be weighing myself every day. Daily weigh-ins are an unhealthy habit I overcame more than a decade ago. Eating disorder recovery is part of many of our health and wellness journeys, and there should be screens to collect data on that history and tailor the plan accordingly. I like to use smart solutions to improve and enhance my life, but not overtake it to boost tech companies’ engagement metrics. Noom presented itself as a 5–10-minute/day commitment, but I found that they prompt users for much more, and you have to be in the app more frequently to “do it right.” I’m sure it works for some people. It seems like a holistic weight-loss app for users who are otherwise clueless. But if I had known what it entailed, or that my daily calorie limit of only 1200 would be the heading to my homescreen, I would have known this wouldn’t work for me.

Title: Not for me, I guess
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve used free apps in the past for tracking exercise and counting calories and have not been successful in trying to shed this extra weight I’ve been carrying. I decided to try this paid app hoping it could give me something the free apps did not. I am very disappointed in the amount of money Ive spend. The app gives you a number of “lessons” each day, a “goal coach,” and after a few weeks, it assigns you to a support group. There’s also a section of the app for you to log your food and track your calories. The lessons are good information, but not worth the price of the app. A lot of the information is stuff I’ve read already online such as “use smaller plates” and “people tend to eat more food when eating in front the TV.” The goal specialist is pretty useless IMO. You get communication from them once a day for the free trial and a week or two after, and then you’re lucky if you get one message a week. I expressed disappointment to my first goal specialist and was very annoyed by her unhelpful and infrequent responses so I asked for a new coach. New coach is even worse. I’m 2 months into the program and I’ve lost a whopping 4 pounds. As I mentioned, a lot of the tips in the articles are things that I knew or things I already do. For the past few weeks, I’ve been buckling down, making sure I’m applying every single tip from the app, sticking to my calorie budget and tracking all of my meals, even using some of the recipes from the app, and I haven’t dropped a single pound. I do not see many people in my group complaining and many of them seem to love the app, but my experience has not been great at all and I would never recommend this program to any of my friends or family. I sincerely regret spending money on this program.

Title: Trapped
----------------------------------------------------------
I signed up for the two week trial late one night and decided to give it more than two weeks. I thought billing was monthly, there was no clear conversation about a contract...and I got trapped. If you have ever had an eating disorder or are vulnerable to eating disorders, quit. This app supports black and white think about types of foods (red, yellow, green...). Because they don’t know much about Participants, the plans are Broad stroked. If you have metabolic issues, older...it won’t be taken into account. The app itself is a little outdated (which is ironic because they make fun of weight watchers saying it’s an old program). It’s eh. If you have never used a good app like spark people, you won’t even notice. He exercise part of the app doesn’t allow for miles to be entered or make distinctions between types of similar activities. The food log is ok. When spark people was new, I was I putting nutritional data constantly because foods just wouldn’t show up in their library. Now...same with Noom. I end up using a similar food because I just don’t have time to input info. I’m paying for this right???  The couch is good. It’s clear there is a lot of automated responding but when she does pipe in, it’s solid. Clearly well trained in CBT and motivational interviewing. Also clear that they are instructed not to spend to much time engaging with people, especially if there is an actual issue. Maybe it’s my fault for not having read the small print but I do feel ripped off. It’s expensive for what it is. Weight watchers has a good app. Spark people is fantastic (breaks down nutritional info much much better) and is FREE. So don’t be an idiot like me. Read before you jump Im and if it fits for you—awesome and good luck

Title: Horrible, buggy app with customer service to match
----------------------------------------------------------
I really wanted to like Noom.  I believe in the philosophy they share.  But my experience has been too disappointing.  First, the app is incredibly limiting and frequently buggy.  The software development team must be second or third rate because the designs aren’t responsive, meaning text is frequently cut off with no way to expand or view.  The database of nutritional information is 99% incorrect - every time I compare to an actual nutritional label of my food, the calorie count is always different for the same serving size.  Even within Noom, depending on what screen you add from, 1 cup could be 48 calories or 1 cup could be 110 calories.  It makes no sense.  The color coding also makes no sense.  Trader Joe’s organic soy milk which is 80 calories a cup is a green food.  Kirkland’s organic soy milk which has the exact same ingredients, and the exact same calorie count, is a yellow food.  Why???  The lessons encourage you to add nuts to your diet as a “healthy snack.”  Nuts are also labeled as a red food and you should either avoid or eat as little as possible.  It’s like nobody in this organization talks to each other.   The “coach” you get is either a bot, or incredibly robotic and unresponsive.  Mine waits 3-4 days before responding to me, and clearly has some script or is just cutting and pasting without actually listening.  A single customer service ticket I filed to ask about billing has been passed around 3 different customer service representative, none of whom have answered my question, the latest one directly contradicts what the first one said.  I’ll be canceling because while I wanted to love Noom, my experience would make me rather light my money on fire.

Title: At first I loved it — it soon lost its appeal
----------------------------------------------------------
At first, I loved this app. Great articles and guidance on how to change the way I view eating and constructive advice on how to eat in a more healthy way. I was excited by the promise of working with an active coach, continuing to learn about “mindful” approaches to being healthy, and, of course, losing weight. I lost 15 pounds in 6 weeks and was thrilled. I shared with all my friends what a great program it was and that they should try it. Then everything stalled. My “coach” texts what are clearly scripted communications: “What are your goals this week,” “How did you do on last week’s goals.” She communicates only once a week — including responses to my questions. It’s as though I’m on her calendar for a certain date and time and that’s the only window of opportunity for communication. My weight loss stalled at week 6 and I am now on week 15. I have shared, several times, with my coach my frustration — only once did she respond directly to my request for help. So, there goes that promise in the app advertising — “Active coaching where the coach dives in and helps to figure out how to improve results.” As of week 7 or 8, the only “support” the app provides is summarization of articles on weight loss and links to those articles. Even worse, it will repeat the same “lesson” (again, just a link to an article) several times. It’s as though the program were carefully designed for the first 4 or 5 weeks and then the designers just got up and walked away. This is supposed to be a 16 week program. It offers a solid 4 to 5 weeks and then it’s useless. So, instead of paying about $9 a week for help, I paid $30. I don’t recommend it at all.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi, there! So sorry to hear that! Our program is actually built out for 52 weeks and extends far beyond the first 16 weeks. However, I completely understand how frustrating it must have been to get accustomed to a particular kind of writing style and have it change on you suddenly. Not to worry, we are working on extending this new style to the rest of the program, which understandably takes time. If you would like to request a coach change, please reach out to us at reviewsupport@noom.com. Thanks for sharing your honest feedback with us!

Title: Be Very Careful
----------------------------------------------------------
While this app creates a facade of balance, maintainability, and healthy decisions, my experience using Noom led me to develop an incredibly unhealthy relationship with food and a very near eating disorder. I have used Noom for three months and I wish I never started. The app has you weigh yourself every morning and meticulously track everything you eat, two things that lead to obsessive thoughts and tendencies around weight loss, body image, and food. The intense pressure to track every calorie was overwhelming and led to extreme food restriction and compulsive eating. I would never recommend using an app like Noom. While it may put on a show of positivity and health, at the end of the day, it is a weight loss app like any other that seeks to make money off of people hating their bodies and the societal pressure to be conventionally thin. My health coach was completely unhelpful and never gave me any guidance regarding goals that would be beneficial for me to focus on. I looked into switching, so that I could find a coach that was more encouraging and helpful, but the app doesn’t offer a way to change your coach...which is strange because you are paying for access to a helpful health coach, yet you have no say in who they are. I cannot overstate how damaging this app was for my mental and physical health. To any person who faces any struggles regarding their relationship with food, do not download this app. It truly encourages disordered eating. I hope that people wishing to make healthy changes in their life turn to support systems and resources that value true wellbeing, instead of calorie budgets, shame, and thinness.

Title: Faudulent charges
----------------------------------------------------------
The app its self is not bad but once i decided that i was not using for what i was paying and decided to cancel it it folled instructions and cancelled it both thru the app in itunes and also contacted my coach and recieved confirmation back from her that she was sorry i had decided to cancel but if i needed help in the future they are there. All sounds good and my itunes acct showed it was nolonger in a monthly renewing status.  Well then i got another $43 ish charge after that and i decided that it was just a overlap in the cancelation and the monthly charge and wasnt going to bother with it.  Then another month later i get another charge $84 thru my paypal acct from them.  I have tried to contact them, the first email they responded that was a itunes issue and i had to contact them. They confirmed there was no $84 charge thru itunes as i could see myself too as it had come thru my paypal. I emailed back to noom to let them what i had found out from itunes and they have never replied again to any emails. I have not been able to find a phone number to contact them.  4 months ago i paid them $84 for them to send me a special food diet plan that was supposed to specific to my needs.  I wasnt impressed with the plan as it didnt address any of the specific challenges i had told them about during my interview with them. That was to be a one time charge and i have never recieved any kind of follow up or additional information from them or ongoing support that would even explain an additional $84 charge.   So at this point they have taken 2 additional amounts out of my account AFTER MY SERVICES WITH THEM WERE CANCELLED.

Title: Program works. App is terrible.
----------------------------------------------------------
The information, knowledge, and support that noom provides is great. It helps break down the psychology behind eating and provides some helpful tricks on how to build healthy habits. I just Hate. The. App. 1. There is no clear list of example green or yellow foods, which would be extremely helpful especially at the beginning of the program. So you have to scan each item in the store to figure out what color it is. 2. While the app syncs with steps and weight (sometimes) in Fitbit, it does not sync your exercise or calorie output. So it undercounts your calories expended so you end up undereating if you go by the noom app. The entire second week of noom I was at a 1500 calorie deficit per day (instead of my aim of 1000) because noom doesn’t accurately count calories! I stopped losing weight (because my body was in starvation mode) until I figured that out (thankfully from my noom group) and just started using my Fitbit app to record food, exercise, etc. 3. No audio support past week two. I really enjoyed the recordings of the noom lessons but just as my trial expired, all audio support stopped too. I had built a great morning routine drinking tea, taking a walk to get my healthy green foods and listening to my noom lessons. Now that is ruined. I am an audio learner so reading the articles just isn’t working as well so I will probably just quit soon. With a terrible app and no audio for the lessons what’s the point?? I could just read a book about food psychology. I do like the noom group and pondered having a noom 1 on 1 coach but I get angry every time I deal with that stupid noom app so I might just peace out!

Title: Can’t recommend this app to anyone in a special circumstance
----------------------------------------------------------
Listen this app is alright for anyone who is an absolute beginner but if you’re more advanced or if you have a special dietary concern, I’d go elsewhere. My “coach” never really gave any guidance and only checked in once every 3-4 days. I felt like I was giving my coach all the info she needed to really help me, and I’ve been dealing with weight loss long enough that I know my own pitfalls really well and communicated them to her. I got completely ignored. I doubt she even read my messages and she skipped over questions I asked all the time. When I asked for a more active coach, she chimed in and told me that if I felt like snacking, I should try more fiber. Not only did she ignore that I specifically said I snack even when I’m not hungry, but cmon telling me to eat more fiber? I’ve known that since high school. Everything she told me was extremely basic. “Eat veggies and avoid candy.” Thanks. I don’t think my coach ever took a look at my food or my profile because I eat veggies every day and log it. Additionally I’m trying to eat a low inflammation diet which I said in my intro interview so I can’t have some veggies. Annoyed, I asked for a new coach because this one clearly didn’t care. It took a day for them to respond and they told me that coaches should only be checking in once a week. So you all should know that this is what you’re getting — 1 message a week from a “professional” who doesn’t have any listed credentials. Two days later I still don’t have a new coach I trust and I definitely distrust the NOOM team. I’m going back to rise; it was much better and I recommend it to everyone looking to try NOOM.

Title: Good idea abysmal execution of app
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried this program for almost 6 months. I really like the idea of caloric density. However almost everything else about the program needs reworking starting with the app. Entering meals is much less user friendly than MyFitnessPal and trying to follow group conversations is impossible. In my group, the majority of the participants have complained about how unfriendly it is. For instance, if you start a conversation thread or comment on someone else’s and another participant responds, you will get a notice but good luck trying to find it. I gave up on the group because of it. Then there’s the individual mentor assigned to you. Most of the contact between myself and my mentor felt like canned responses on her part. I never felt like she was really invested in my weight loss. Additionally, when I did try to start an actual conversation with her it would take DAYS for a response. For a while I thought that was just my bad luck, but my husband signed up and quit after two weeks because of the same thing. Then there are the articles assigned. All is the articles are new for the first 2 months, but after that they are recycled so I have given up on those too. Finally, if you do pay for the program then decide you want to quit, there is no prorate. You’re stuck until the end of the 2 months you prepay for which is why I have stuck with it for almost 6 months. I lost track of when I started and missed the deadline before the end of my 4th month to tell Noom I wanted out. So I was forced to pay for another 2 months. The money I have spent on this program is not worth the little amount of weight I have lost.

Title: Their money trumps you
----------------------------------------------------------
I experienced an unbelievable string of mistakes and errors: was signed up for the wrong program (yes, there are more than one which you may never know, due to aggressive marketing), then programmed to receive incorrect content and group (they didn’t even match), then got spotty support (forget the warning to wait 6 hours - it’s more like 6 days and support staff doesn’t read old notes) then had to repeat content a second time due to error, then was unceremoniously dumped out of the content by a bot when I tried to request the correct content, then was told correction of their error would mean getting the same content a 3rd time. I infer that bots are aggressive in order to remove people with any concern, so that remaining groups are completely positive. Money is made off the good will of people supporting each other in groups. Given hindsight, my good will kept me at this for far too long. Beware: free content is bare bones, and free trial has minimal content and no groups. Price of subscription varies wildly and is loosely based on amount of time you are predicted to need to reach your goal, regardless of the stated length of the subscription. I was refused an itemized bill documenting the amount of tax paid. Is that illegal? My repayment was not complete, due to an early prorated refund to facilitate changing programs.  Check Better Business Bureau to see record of many problems with resolution limited to automated language and repayment. I predict this review will receive a pleasantly worded, automated, response asking me to contact support because they would love to resolve this problem.

Title: Deceitful Company
----------------------------------------------------------
I joined Noom because I friend told me how it helped her become more heathy. I was so excited to try it out. I found a code that gave me a heavily discounted rate so I signed and paid for four months at this discounted rate. I had lost weight liked the color codes of food. I was getting in a groove where I was making progress. Then I wake up to read an article and I see that my subscription was cancelled. I did not cancel my subscription. I literally talked to costumer service all day. I could rejoin but for a much higher rate actually a rate 4 times what I had paid for. I could not afford that so I begged them to just reinstate my account especially in a time of COVID. They refused and now said I could not even use my code bc it was not valid any longer. Then finally they said they could give me a code to get it the same price so I jumped on it. When signing up it showed the discounted rate then when it processed it raised double the price I contacted them again at this point in tears and they just cancelled my subscription and refunded my money. So I would recommend a company such as weight watchers for the price or Myfitness Pal. Definitely not worth the money, time, or effort and terrible customer service. Very disappointed and discouraged! Still do not understand why I was cancelled in the first place. Customer a vice dis say bc I selected not to renew option but I do not remember doing that but I thought that meant after my 4 months. So my feeling they cancelled me on purpose after I was showing success to MAKE me pay the higher rate to continue.

Title: Please beware
----------------------------------------------------------
As someone who has struggled with eating disorder recovery while also trying to lose weight, I felt like this program might be a good choice. Before I started Noom I had improved immensely on my relationship with food all on my own, with that came some weight gain which I wasn’t very happy about but I was determined to tackle it in a healthy way that didn’t bring me back to my disorder. Noom’s “psychological hack” into weight loss is really just assigning adjectives to certain foods. While they do point out that it’s okay to eat “bad” or “red” foods, I found myself back in a disordered mindset because of those labels. The program was a huge setback for me. In addition to that, their calorie recommendation was 1,200. This was not rooted in any sort of calculation based on my body type or resting metabolic rate or trying to find the best caloric deficit for me. I lost weight for the first couple of weeks but it quickly came back because that caloric amount wasn’t sustainable for someone as active as I was at the time. When I would reach out to my coach for help I would receive a very generic answer like “well what do you think is the best way to fix that issue?” Which made me feel like I could’ve provided that same help for myself and saved the money had I been just a little more introspective. The articles are about the only thing that was helpful for me which is unfortunate because I really wanted to give this a shot and have it work out. At the end of the day Noom caused more problems for me than solve them.

Title: Sketchiest Billing Ever
----------------------------------------------------------
I have never left an app review, but Noom has some of the shadiest billing practices I have ever encountered. So, something needs to be said. I registered for an 8 month course my first time last year, which suddenly expired 3 months in and I had to renew it? They gave me no explanation when I asked why. They simply said, “Well, it says it expired in our system.” It’s simple math to see it was incorrect. They double charged me in February of this year, then refused to refund one of the charges. I showed them documented proof of the double charges. Nothing. Just a “well, we only see one in our system.” Now, they’ve suddenly started doing auto-renew, which has never happened before. They auto-renewed my subscription with no warning, and refuses to refund it. I contacted them within a day of seeing the charge. I was told that “any charges after the 14 day trial will not be refunded.” Apparently, this means anything they charge you after the first 14 days of downloading the app (auto renew, “expired subscription”, double charges, etc.) is not refunded. Ever. I have never had to deal with a company this shady with their billing practices. Any reputable company would have logically concluded that the subscription had not expired at the correct time, that there had been two charges, and that if they’re contacted with a cancellation request while the auto renew is still pending, then it’s good practices to refund it. Noom is clearly not a reputable company. Do not trust them with your billing info.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
So sorry to hear that! All subscriptions auto-renew until canceled. It sounds like you accidentally signed up for more than one subscription. Do you mind reaching out to us at reviewsupport@noom.com? We'll be happy to look into this for you. Thanks!

Title: Noom is not what they say it is
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been on Noom since Jan 11 and have lost about 12 pounds. I have 50 pounds left so I have a lot of weight to lose. The Noom daily lessons are good for the most part. However, the coaching is virtually non- existent and not at all what Noom leads you to believe in their advertising. My coach rarely reaches out to me and this is the second coach I’ve had so far. And when they do reach out it’s not proactive. It’s usually to answer a question. So the coaching aspect is highly disappointing. Also, there is zero nutritional analysis on the app.  It’s impossible to know how much micronutrients you’re getting i.e., protein, carbs and fats. That’s vital and completely missing from the app. There’s a daily lesson on increasing protein, in fact, which makes the point about not having a way of know ones daily protein intake that much sharper. To just tell users to increase protein can result in users getting kidney stones since there’s no way for them to know how much protein they’re getting. Perhaps they’re already at their limit. In that sense I find it reprehensible and irresponsible for Noom to be making medical recommendations. Now that Noom charged me the full amount I will keep going since it’s expensive and I don’t want it all to be for nothing. What’s making a difference for me is weighing myself daily and logging my food daily. I can do that on virtually any other weight loss app and also get the benefit of knowing my macros. It’s for those reasons that I cannot recommend Noom.

Title: Non-refundable trial- beware
----------------------------------------------------------
I was trying noom during the 7 day free trial to see if it was for me. Around day 5 I realized that while it was a well put together service, it was not something I wanted to pay 45$ a month for. At that point the instructions on how to cancel the subscription before your trial is up is to contact your “Goal Specialist” or whoever it is, who is basically your primary point of contact in the app. I contact them on day 5 to let them know that did not want to renew the subscription. Day 5, 6, and 7 go by without any word from this person and I was not too phased because I had stopped using the app entirely. On day 7 I was charged for the subscription, getting suspicious. Day 8 I hear from my specialist that if I want to cancel I need to do it through the iCloud interface since I bought it on the app store. Simple enough! Should have been literally the first thing under “How to cancel”!!! So I tell them I was already charged but figured I should be refunded because I submitted a formal cancellation to them. No dice. I need to submit it (a refund request) through Apple, who reject the request immediately. SO Im stuck paying nearly $50 for a service I doing want, ALL of the customer support is copying and pasting a check list to me explaining how I need to cancel on iCloud and request a refund from Apple, and it seems like that is worth a 1 star review. If this is your jam and it works, great, customer service wise and someone who may be just trying it out, stay far away.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
So sorry to hear this! Unfortunately, we cannot cancel or refund subscriptions purchased through iTunes. You should have received a confirmation email from Apple directly with your billing details and cancellation instructions. Not to worry, Apple will sometimes refund the charge after a second request for a refund. We recommend that you reach out them through their live chat service or by phone to do so. Thanks for sharing your experience!

Title: Stick with free app; subscription too glitchy
----------------------------------------------------------
After committing to a year’s subscription and less than half way through a two week trial, I received a message out of the blue from my Goal Specialist Coach saying “sorry to see you go, you will be cancelled as requested”.  Except that I never cancelled.  After contacting Customer Support, I was told I was “accidentally” cancelled and would need to re-sign up for my year subscription (I had not yet been charged) before my two week trial ended in order to keep my coach and progress through their curriculum.  The next day I had a message from my coach saying I’d been converted to the free app.  Again out of the blue.  So I didn’t even get to complete my two week trial.  All of my communications with my coach about this were unanswered, and all customer support could say is they were really sorry for the inconvenience and I’d need to re-sign up.  I don’t know what to make of any of this, except to think things must be very glitchy for Noom right now, maybe because of New Year’s volume?  Anyway, I definitely don’t trust the app enough to re-try a subscription at this point.  Who’s to say I wouldn’t be a month in and then get “accidentally” cancelled.  Very discouraging. However, I do like the free app with color coded food tracking and which also includes weight and exercise tracking.  It has a good database of food and is easy to use.  I just don’t think the paid version is quite ready for prime time.

Title: Disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
Honestly I’m disappointed. I’m fairly in shape and was looking to loose 10-15lbs to feel more myself I exercise regularly just have gotten a bit out of shape due to office life so I figured this app/program would be great support in doing so and provide that extra push I needed.  The app itself is fine, the program itself is nothing new and I rather like the green,yellow, red food monitoring system. Where I feel let down is my coach and group. The group is so annoying, supposedly you’re put in a group with people with similar goals and habits. My group is not even close to that it’s a bunch of people complaining about what they can/can’t eat and bragging about walking a mile a day.... With my group being a bust, I was really hoping that maybe my coach would provide some candid feedback and support on this journey. Multiple times I’ve reached out about how frustrated I was about my scale not moving much(I have lost 5lbs over 2 months), and her advise was to focus on other signs of weight loss... after I quit my subscription and again told her I was frustrated she finally asked if she could give me feedback on what I had been logging and why my scale might not be moving as much as I want.... yes lady that is why I signed up for this aren’t you just suppose to be doing that? Maybe I didn’t read enough on this before joining but based on all the hype and great reviews I was expecting more.

Title: DISAPPOINTED
----------------------------------------------------------
I enjoyed the articles and focus on the psychology of weight loss, but found Noom to be ultimately unhelpful. Specifically my fitness coach, who I gave up on after many confusing responses to my questions, failing to help me set a weekly goal after asking many times, and realizing my coach was most likely a bot anyway. Plus, I found the calorie counts and color-coding to be inaccurate. Lose-it! has accurate data and I can do that for free. Side note: I loved the basic idea here, and if I were calorie counting for the first time ever I probably would have continued. But I have counted before and was looking for something exciting and new. Plus, the whole charade of making our weight loss coaches seem human when they're clearly a bots made me feel lied to, especially when I'm paying so much. Just feels shady. Also, where was the customized weight loss and meal plan I paid extra for at checkout? I never received any info about it and my coach/ bot wouldn't give me a clear answer about it. Am I getting a refund for that? Also, my Fitbit steps wouldn't show under the "step goal" even though the two accounts were linked and worked for the first day. Very disappointed. Also, why does the food logging screen take you back to the home page after you enter a food? Why not go back to your logged day? Noom’s design is really well done in most areas, but that was a very annoying choice.

Title: Nice beginning/horrible middle-end
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is for those who want to lose a little weight but aren't in any rush. By that I mean if it took 6 months to take a little more than a few inches off they'd be okay. If you're looking for a decent amount of results for all of the hectic and unnecessary work they make you do then this isn't for you. For starters, I was already suspicious about the fact that bad reviews had five stars. In other words, they're paying to have people's reviews changed. There's no way so many bad reviewers messed up and didn't realize they hit five stars. Not bashing just saying what I'm seeing. As for my experience with the app, first few days I didn't even talk to my "team" that they push so hard for you to keep updating. Want to know why I didn't update them? 1.Because they rarely respond, 2. "They" is only one person. My second issue, the FAQ section is either in dire need of updating or its purposely misleading. The app doesn't even look like the visuals they use to help you. Support is a long cue of unanswered automated robots. If you decide to do the trial, make sure you have a quick way of unsubscribing. My guess is that they're just making it hard so they can get your money. The company has a great concept, they just weren't ready for so much success in such little time. Now everything seems jumbled and unprofessional. I was rooting for them hoping I was simply paranoid.

Title: Mediocre and Clunky
----------------------------------------------------------
I hoped Noom would help me get my nutrition on track as I’m working towards body recomposition and hitting powerlifting goals. After two months with the program, I’ve been really disappointed. The nutrition information is lacking; you can’t track macros; and the “red, yellow, green” calorie density doesn’t necessarily fit within fitness goals like adding more protein. I’ve also seen some reviews from actual registered dietitians that made me regret purchasing this product. The psychology information is interesting, but the constant refrain of “this is not a diet” really doesn’t square with all the diet language and highly restrictive calorie budgets in the app. The language of daily modules felt shaming and condescending at times, even as I hit some of my goals. My individual coach did not offer useful or specific information (and coaches aren’t necessarily RDs or have professional training beyond Noom’s certification) and while some members of my group seemed to appreciate the community aspect, I did not find it helpful. Ultimately, this was a complete waste of money. I would recommend a free tracker if you’re interested in logging meals to aim for certain macro or calorie goals. I also think it’s way more helpful to meet with an actual RD when you’re trying to work on correcting nutritional deficiencies and other nutrition or weight loss goals.

Title: Customer support poor communication
----------------------------------------------------------
I decided to try Noom for a bit and was willing to pay for a few months to try the full subscription. For reasons I will never understand and which have never been fully explained to me, within a week my Goal Specialist or the system or someone on their end cancelled my subscription. I had to contact customer support 3 times to get anyone to answer me. When they finally did, they apologized for the error and even gave me a link for a 20% discount. I tried to sign back up with the discount and it never worked. I contacted customer support again and no one ever responded so I signed up thru iTunes which was 3x the price!! I contacted customer support again to try to get it straightened out. No one ever got back to me. In the meantime my Goal Specialist found out I was pregnant. I had been honest that I was pregnant and not looking to lose weight, just motivation to eat healthy throughout my pregnancy. He informed me that because Noom is specifically for weight loss (it really isn’t. Their tips and advice are all around healthy eating but their calorie suggestions are very very low hence the weight loss. I was just eating more calories than they recommended each day) they would not allow me to continue and they cancelled me again! I asked if I could just continue but not log my calories or eat above the recommendation and no one ever answered me.

Title: Disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve had this only for 3 days, but I have to say I’m super disappointed with what this “program” is. Basically it’s an eating-disorder inducing time and money waster. The crux of it is that you log every detail of what you ate every day, which is extremely annoying and takes at least 20 minutes a day because the system is so janky. It’s super unintuitive to use with zero instructions, many foods that are in there have wrong info, you can’t easily find foods you’ve eaten/entered before, and there’s so way to edit custom meals you’ve entered. Then they want you to weigh yourself everyday, which seems like total overkill. Also the weight loss goals they give you are crazy and totally unrealistic and seem to come out of nowhere. After I entered my info they told me I should eat 1200 calories a day! That’s insane and synonymous with anorexia. The most annoying thing is that half of the advice they give makes zero sense in COVID times. You’d think that after over a year of this they would have updated some things. Like it’s talking about going to the gym, in person shopping, eating at restaurants, commuting to work - stuff that is totally irrelevant to many people during a pandemic and not at all acknowledging the unique situation people are in now. And so far the “psychology” advice has seemed really trite. I regret paying for this.

Title: Not worth the money
----------------------------------------------------------
I was so excited when I started Noom. Even though it was expensive, I added on the meal, exercise, and DNA programs. That was my first major mistake. The food and meal “programs” are a joke. I thought it was going to be extra coaching but it was just a stupid pdf. The DNA was worse. It took three months to get the “results”. Maybe I was just too stupid to understand them, but it literally told me nothing of any use. The groups they put you in are huge and overwhelming. I did direct message a few people, but after 3 months no one had lost any weight and they were all giving up on the program. And the personal coach (who sends one text a week) is like talking to a computer they forgot to give a personality. She would just repeat back what i said, but in the form of a question. If I have to answer my own questions, what good are you? The program itself is all common sense. You would have to have never been on a diet or thought about food in your life to get something out of this app. They make you pay upfront for a six month program, and I understand why. Because it was so annoying after a month most people stopped using it. My advice to others is just find a free app and log your food. Noom is such a waste of money that it ends up being upsetting. I literally change the channel when one of there commercials comes on the tv.

Title: This criticism for the developers ONLY
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve had a tremendous, life changing experience with Noom in the last 9 months and lost a 1/4 of my total weight. The concept is brilliant and I can’t recommend it enough. With that being said: I’ve never seen an app with more nuisances when it come to recording data.  So many food color groups are marked wrong and have irrelevant measuring sizes or food are duplicated several times with slightly different name but for the same product. One will have a tbsp and the other won’t. Constantly going back and forth. But the MOST frustrating part is the fact the the “easy units” calories screen does not corresponds to the “other units” screen. In one page 1 cup of Silk Soy milk can show 100 calories while on the other it will show 34 calories. Funny how it’s called “easy units”. My guess is that many people do not reach their goals or give up because they trust the measurements provided by the lack of checks and balances at Noom. This issue is present across MANY food items and has been so for the 9 months I’ve been on.  If a single programmer that cares would actually use Noom themselves the many annoying issues would be obvious after one day. So with everything i said and my love to Noom I’m afraid that a competition that will create a good working app will be a serious threat to the viability of this company.

Title: Sadly not as advertised
----------------------------------------------------------
I was really excited to try out Noom. I was already using MyfitnessPal but what caught my attention about Noom was the Coaching aspect of the app. I will warn you - if you are also intrigued by this app for that same reason then do not waste your money. You first get assigned a “Goal Specialist Coach” this person never responded and after about 3 weeks I was starting to get frustrated because I felt like I was paying for what I was already getting from MyFitnessPal (calorie counting, weighing in, recipe suggestions, etc) so I opted to cancel. They convinced me to stay on with a month to month payment so I decided to give them one more shot after mentioning I wasn’t getting any real feedback from this Goal Specialist. That following week they were suppose to pair me with a Group and a Group Coach. This never happened. Day and day out my daily tasks would say ok now check in with your group or group coach but still nothing. I reached out about not having a group to my Goal Specialist and nothing- I was basically ghosted. So I cancelled. In the end for me I didn’t see the value without the coach aspect of the app. If the coach part was not a fake front and actually existed then I would have kept going. They did give me back a refund in the end because they knew they did not provide the service they promised.

Title: Inccurate Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------
I am a pretty disappointed that their food database to pick from is so poor in terms of availability and accuracy. I love the idea behind Noom and hope they fix this soon. For the amount of money you have to pay they should have have an extensive food database already in place. Because the database is so minimal the accuracy of the analysis is wrong as it doesn’t account for items you have to manually enter and if it’s there and WRONG you have to submit for it to be edited and they seem to lag on getting them corrected (which I find myself doing once/twice/three times a day, including submitting errors found with already entered foods). If you’re going to base the clients success on learning how to make smarter decisions and that’s shown via analysis of your daily selections why wasn’t this prioritized? Makes me wonder if this is another “fad” people are falling victim too. At the very least why aren’t we able to connect to apps that actually took the time to ensure they had a good food database and are quick to fix errors like myfitnesspal and Fitbit? Those are FREE apps and I rarely have issues finding my foods. Unfortunately I will not recommend for people to sign up for this if asked and think it’s important to voice this on my social media. I will be cancelling soon if this isn’t addressed.

Title: The Worst
----------------------------------------------------------
I stopped using this “service”. At first I was excited at having a group of people on the same journey. But then I realized it was basically just a bunch of people posting what they were being told to post based on that days lesson with little to no actual conversation. What’s the point of that? This idea of the personal goal specialist is great, but terrible in practice. The responses seem mechanical/automated. I’m not even sure mine was a real person. I’d get a single response and nothing for days. How do you set a goal with a conversation held over the span of 6 days? Or am I coming up with it myself? If that’s the case, why am I paying for one?! I asked for help directly, and spoke up on my issues and was ignored. I canceled early and was given a nice discount, which begs the question... why is the cost so high in the first place if one can get a reduced rate? I found other services just as helpful, if not more so. The food classifying is interesting but it’s not accurate. A cereal I enjoy is listed 8-9 times with different serving sizes and calorie counts. When I scan the cereal the incorrect serving/calorie ratio comes up and it’s a red food. But when I manually search it, it’s yellow. So if one was eating a lot of what they thought was a yellow food but was actually a red food...

Title: Worst Customer Service; Easier to Lose Weight than use this program
----------------------------------------------------------
Downloaded the app several weeks ago, was loving it at first and cruising right along. Then everything disappeared. I could only log weight, meals, and water. My courses were no longer appearing and I was never assigned a coaching team. I assumed I was waiting to be assigned, so I waited a few days, but still nothing. I reached out to support and they showed my subscription as cancelled. After looking into it further, I found my bank had flagged the transaction as fraudulent. After several back and forths with 2 different support agents, I had to re-sign up and used a different account to pay. With my new (same email) sign-up it re-set all the courses I had already completed. They only way to advance my courses was through my coach which was still never assigned. Today I again had no courses, no coaching team. Reached out to yet ANOTHER support person who said my subscription had been cancelled again. There was the payment AND a refund pending on my account. A refund that I didn’t request and now have to start all over again. I never received any kind of notifications or anything that there were issues. The agents were not helpful at all. My “10 minutes a day” has turned into several hours. Literally easier to lose a few pounds than use this program and app.

Title: Disappointed- An Unmet Need for Non-binary Folks
----------------------------------------------------------
I just started using Noom’s trial, and while I 100% understand the need for asking your biological sex for nutritional and physiological purposes in a weight loss app...I really had hoped an app run by psychologists and those in behavioral health would be more inclusive of gender identity. As someone assigned female at birth, I don’t identify as a woman and seeing the prompts “women in your age bracket ___” during the initial setup was a little off-putting and almost made me not sign up. If there could just be a simple option of pronoun choice during the initial setup, that would save a lot of heartbreak for gender non-conforming and non-binary individuals like myself who don’t use the terms woman or man to define myself. I get the need to use statistics to relate to those signing up, but maybe having a third option for an average among men and women can make up the statistic for individuals who don’t identify as either...? It may even increase your membership sign ups if the app was more inclusive. I’m not sure if I’ll continue to use Noom depending on how inclusive the coaches are, but that will only come through time and experience while I do the trial. I’m happy to change my review and rating if things change to be more inclusive in the future.

Title: Not much here you can't get with ads for free elsewhere
----------------------------------------------------------
I only did this for 1 week.  The coach only chimed in once with a generic comment.  Seems like she's just a bot.  The food logging is OK as long as you buy and eat name-brand stuff.  I cook from scratch and there is no way to put in and save recipies. The articles and quizzes are cute, but not anything I don't already know.  I've been eating pretty healthy for years, but as the age creeps up, so do the pounds.  I mostly need support to stop snacking on chocolate and ice cream.  I think this app doesn't do this.  I splurged and wasted my money on the 'personalized' food and exercise plan.  Ha!  The exercise plan is a 40 page book describing any exercise anyone would ever want to do -- nothing personalized about it.  The food plan was just a list of healthy, small portion generic items.  And the thing that really drove me crazy was that there is no sync of this program on different devices.  If I entered breakfast on my iPad, when I went to enter lunch at work on my phone it didn't know that breakfast had already been entered elsewhere.  You have to pick one device only.  I like the bigger screen of the iPad when it's handy, but only the phone will log steps, etc.  I'm going back to My Fitness Pal.  Not as cutsy, but much better deal for the price.

Title: The app is why I left Noom
----------------------------------------------------------
I used this for the full length of my free trial. I liked the logging system for food, and the people I dealt with were all exceptionally kind and helpful. However, this app never worked for me like it should have. It does not sync well with Fitbit, and since Fitbit does not sync with Apple Health, you're out of luck for any day your steps don't sync correctly. I constantly had to tell my coach what she was seeing in the app was incorrect. In addition, you could not manually enter any data related to activity or go back to sync past days so it was correct. In addition, their scan feature is pointless because unlike MyFitnessPal, scanning a new item doesn't add it to their database- it just tells you "sorry, not in the system," so you have to enter everything on the label yourself. Lastly, the tech support was basically non existent, especially when related to potential issues with the app itself; all troubleshooting came down to was deleting the app and reinstalling. It was awful and caused me so much stress I knew I had to leave it. If they overhauled the app to work better with existing systems, it would be a great tool but the last thing I need is to spend 30 minutes trying to get the app to function when I could be exercising, instead.

Title: Scam billing
----------------------------------------------------------
Great if you want to be on a system and it work for you, and if you want to be billed. There is no “free trial” if the company can help it. I cancelled a week before the free trail ended. Got a confirmation message in the app, where all communication occurs. Then I got charged anyway—surprise! Luckily I do my bank account balance daily and contacted them immediately. I paid through PayPal anticipating this might happen. I contacted Noom and provided them screenshots of the cancellation request. The cancellation was apparently “automated,” and the noom person I chatted with said “we don’t cancel subscriptions automatically. You have to talk to a person.”  That’s funny, since the automated cancellation request said it was cancelled and nothing about having to contact them anywhere else. In fact to the contrary when you go to cancel I followed the exact recipe for how to do it. The program can definitely work, and it’s a calorie-counting program with a small amount of behavioral science thrown in, and a little bit of nutritional education. It can certainly work for weight loss if you stick to it. But it’s too bad that the program is designed to fraudulently steal money from its customers who try to unsubscribe. For that, it’s an automatic F!

Title: Deceptive Billing Practices
----------------------------------------------------------
WEIGHT OVER WALLET: After finding the program informative but unhelpful I stopped using it for several months. I woke up this morning to see I had a huge charge for renewing my plan for six months. I was shocked. READ THE FINE PRINT! I had no clue that Noom automatically enrolls all of its users in an auto-renewal billing cycle. It had been so long since I’d used the app I didn’t think to cancel, or even understand that I had to cancel. I looked for a way to opt-out of the auto-renewal and it turns out YOU CANT. You are required to message your goal specialist (who does not respond immediately) and ASK to cancel your auto-renewal. This is fine-print FRAUD at its finest. I had to file a complaint in order to get any immediate customer service and then was finally granted a refund. I also contacted my bank to let them know what happened. Even though I agreed to one six month plan, my bank regards this practice of opting-out as fraud and they have placed the description of the charge on their CONSUMER FRAUD WATCHLIST. Hopefully someone with some power gets wise to Noom’s fraudulent billing practice and forces a change. This was an extremely distressing way to wake up and I will not be recommending Noom to anyone because of this experience.

Title: Good as a calorie tracker
----------------------------------------------------------
When I first joined I was asked to pick the price to pay that I thought was fair. I picked the max amount. I received a “meal plan” and an “exercise plan” which was minimumly helpful. I was promised two coaches. One introduced herself but never really involved herself with me, the other never did. Most of the messages I got as a paying member were computer generated. The “coach” told me she didn’t work on weekends and asked me what I wanted from her. I don’t know...I told her you’re the coach, tell me how it works... I then requested a different coach and never got one. After complete absence from the coach for about a week, I cancelled. Then I got a computer generated message saying that I could pay another price. So I said why not give it a second chance. I was never given that chance. I was cancelled and the ability to see recipes was removed. All that was left was the tracking calories part. I tried to “take a course”. I filled out the whole questionnaire. At the end of the questionnaire nothing g happened yet I continued to be asked if I wanted to take a course.  Ultimately it was a terrible experience except for the calorie counter. Due solely to my own will power, I reached my weight loss goal in 3 months.

Title: Really enjoyed at first
----------------------------------------------------------
I really liked this app at first and I wish I could give it a couple different ratings I love the educational material that they teach and it’s fun to learn but for 200$ for 8 months I kind of expected more interaction with the goal specialist and group coach to me they seem like bots like I don’t think they are real people and it’s upsetting. My goal specialist does not help set goals or doesn’t even really interact with me I honestly paid because I felt like it could help me with accountability but it didn’t I have lost weight but not because of this app I will say tho this app helped me realize my habits with food and changed it a bit but it’s not worth the money there may be a better app or actual small business trainer I’d rather support. They also group you with people your age in this group well I’m a 21 year old male and everyone I’ve seen who interacts with the group is a female 25 and older I have yet to see someone close to my age and share same workouts or interest. I hit the gym 1-2 hrs a day hard I don’t go on a brisk walk for 20 minutes like Jennifer does cause she has 4 kids and a husband to please. Loved the app at first but it’s not worth it. Wish I could rate different categories of the app.

Title: You’re paying to just stare at your phone
----------------------------------------------------------
You’re pretty much buying a bunch of time clicking and looking at your phone. There are many issues that the app asks you to do that are either triggering or counterproductive for if you have tried multiple times to lose weight. 3 months of weighing myself everyday has done more harm to me than weighing myself once a week and it has hardly helped me build any resilience, which was what the app offered. Having to load every item in the meal gets old really fast and it didn’t teach me anything I didn’t know already. The articles are extremely patronizing for someone who wants to learn more about themselves. One would expect to gain something form having to invest that much time and money in the app, but none of the articles gave me any information or insight that I didn’t already have. All these led me to avoid using the app altogether. Don’t do this to yourself. Go seek for professional help instead of paying to forcibly give your phone more attention under de disguise of self care. Also, think about this: if psychology is already faulty when its handled by humans one on one, now imagine what that means when you’re trusting a faulty app with crappy tech support in your phone with your psychological well-being.

Title: Customer service is useless. They canceled my subscription for no reason.
----------------------------------------------------------
So incredibly unhappy with this app/company. Literally never written a review on the app store before, but this was an experience unlike any other. I was really excited to start - chatting with my coach the first few days, and then I asked her a question about the program that she didn't know the answer to, (which was totally understandable) so she recommended I email customer service. I did right away (this was day three of my first week). The following morning, I had an automated email response canceling my account. I freaked out and contacted the "was this a mistake?" Link on the cancel email, and sent a message to my coach. She apologized and told me I should contact the customer support line (again). So I did. Three emails and two "contact us" submissions later, I never heard back from them (Other than 5 automated - "we received your message and will get back to you shortly" messages). This started 6 days ago. My account has now been canceled, and I have no way to access my coach or continue the trial period. And to think - I was already planning on continuing on and paying this company the $130 for my next three months. Glad their horrid customer service became apparent before my trial period ended.

Title: This app is a scam.
----------------------------------------------------------
From the moment you download this app they are hustling you for money. They give you a seven day free trial but not until they have your credit card. What do they deliver during the 7 days?  Nothing but pablum.  Set some goals and breathe.  They keep sucking information out of you.  And then, there’s no warning your 7day free trial is going to end. They just quietly charge your credit card for THREE MONTHS @ $129.  The day the charge showed up on my credit card I contacted their customer support. They refused to cancel the three month subscription hiding behind the fine print of their no refunds policy which of course I was supposed to have memorized. The final insult was that they recommended I should have cancelled several days before the end of the trial. In other words it’s not a 7 day trial, it’s effectively a 5 day trial if you have any inclination of cancelling your membership.  In the app, if you try to cancel, they automatically offer you the ability to tack on a month-to-month subscription for $19/mo…after, of course, they swindled you out of your first 3 months at $129. The service isn’t even worth $19/mo.  DO NOT SUPPORT THESE MONEY HUSTLERS.  THEY ARE JUST ANOTHER SCAMMY WEIGHT LOSS RACKET.

Title: Shady
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this app.  It’s designed to help you make gentle, effective, lasting change.  But the business practices of this company are SO SHADY that the whole thing has left a bad taste in my mouth.  I definitely signed up for a one-month auto renew; I checked my membership at some point and saw that it was set for a two month auto-renew.  Other details were different too.  This was definitely not a mistake on my end as I triple checked, I knew I was not ready to commit to two months.  You are told to contact your coach to ask about cancellation.  I messaged her about the mistake.  Got a response back days later that changes can be made by logging back on to website.  Log back on to website.  Surprise!  That is not a change that can actually be made on the website. The coach only gets back to you every few days, so now it’s too late to make this change.  I imagine she would just send me back to the website.  There is no contact info or phone number on the website.  There are so many reviews like this about them.  To NOOM: Trust your product and stop stealing people’s money.  You have a good product — you’re also STEALING money.  The first doesn’t justify the second. #nerdsshouldntsteal

Title: Fraudulent And Dangerous
----------------------------------------------------------
Never give them your credit card number! I paid extra for a fitness plan customized to my circumstances: I.e. hips issues. There was no customization. They sent me a boilerplate quite telling me to do squats and lunges that would have shredded my hips. I asked for a refund for the boilerplate plan.  2) Noom  asked for access so they could sync with my Fitbit. I granted it. The Noom app informed me that they had synced with my Fitbit. Yet Noom app never read any data off Fitbit that would have helped me, such as my step count. Was informed that was because Noom was having server problem - for three days in a row? 3) Finally fed up, I tried to cancel my subscription before I was billed. There is no way to log in and cancel. You have to message a “coach” saying you wish to cancel. I received an automated message with  a link that purportedly would allow me to cancel. The link was to a blank page.  Then I went to the billing area of my account and tried to delete the card used when signing up. They don’t allow you to delete a payment method — just add new ones. State Attorneys General should investigate this company. Feels like deliberate attempts to defraud people and prevent cancellations.

Title: Too much to read....
----------------------------------------------------------
Noom weight loss program seemed to focus on the psychological aspect of food. That got my interest because I gained 25 pounds over the last year, after being at home more than being at work, due to Covid. I’m 5’5” and I’ve always maintained a healthy weight of around 130. I didn’t overindulge in food, I exercised regularly and never dieted because I was always mindful of my weight. This last year, I ate more and was overall less active. Now I’m over 50 years old and the heaviest I’ve ever been. I’m a busy woman, I own a small business, time is a precious commodity. I figured Noom would cut to the chase. So I purchased 3 months. I figured, before each session there would be a short summary of food and psychology, then it would give me some direction. It was a freakin dissertation! A BOT would periodically send me a message of “encouragement”...to READ the next steps....NOT, let’s TAKE a few steps or let’s get active! Sitting on my bum READING why I’ve eaten more than I should have, isn’t going to get the weight off! This is precisely why I hate these weight loss gimmicks, the only things I’ve lost while participating with Noom, are time and, of course, money!!! Never again!!!

Title: Not at all worth it if you are visually impaired
----------------------------------------------------------
Have I lost weight? Yes, in four weeks I have lost four pounds. My Noom coach checks in on me via the Noom messaging system once weekly. I am visually impaired, since Noom was available on the Apple Store, I downloaded it and put in the obligatory credit card information. After my first day, they wanted to calculate my steps. I grabbed my iPhone, put it in my pocket, and began doing my usual teaching. My steps didn’t calculate over from my iPhone to my iPad, & neither did my meal calculations or most of my posts. I requested help, which was provided the following day. Apparently Noom doesn’t work on iPad, but it does on iPhone. Here’s the rub, the Noom strategy posts with its psychological tips are quite lengthy, I can barely see them and Noom doesn’t work with my iPhone turned sideways. Some of my Noom group mates leave lengthy posts, which I can’t read either due to the tiny font of my iPhone. So, I’m reduced to paying out of my pocket for a step calculator and calorie calculator similar to the one I have free on my iPhone. Long story short, Noom does not have accommodations for visually impaired people, so if you are visually impaired, don’t waste your money like I have.

Title: Just not right and very disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
I was just charged and tried to cancel the subscription as it is not working for me. But the system says they don’t return your money as it was already charged and I will have access to my account for the rest of the cycle. But it just started and I’m trying to say I don’t want it. Everybody can refund why can’t they? Why do I have to pay for something I don’t want? They should at least send a reminder asking if we want to keep the subscription and inform that if we don’t cancel in X number of day they will charge the card and then inform that once charged there is no refund. So my understanding is this is how they make money on us! 🤬 Life gets busy and sometimes overwhelming and it is har dor remember that the Noom subscription need to be cancel by 9/11 otherwise I’ll pay $99 with no refund... I didn’t! Now as a penalty I have to pay $99 for something I won’t use. Wow! If this was working for me I would be more than happy to pay but it is not. There are a lot to keep up with beside everything else we have in life plus all the articles, quizzes, inputs and keeping in mind to carry your phone everywhere to keep counting steps.. It just didn’t work for me. Very disappointed.

Title: Not sure how to feel, not for me. Could be for you.
----------------------------------------------------------
Noom is an interesting take on the same old problems with diet culture. I did enjoy some of the psychological aspects of this plan, however at it’s core it is about caloric intake. It’s not magic. The coach is a nice touch but it is important yo note they are not certified in any way. Also the food tracker is clunky. As a side note I continued to gain weight while using this app. The community could be nice if you like facebook, but I do not. It’s nice to celebrate other peoples successes but if you aren’t having success you just feel like a failure. The reassurance that you will get is, just stick to it, keep paying and it will happen. For me it did not. It did not at all. I hope people do find success with this app, but if you don’t stop paying and move on. Don’t hesitate reaching out the tech support to stop charging your account. The fact that the app tries to push you tell your couch directly to cancel the account is manipulation because you develop a more personal relationship with the coach. And your failure feels like a reflection on them even though a once size fits all program is never a good fit for everyone. For the record I start noom at 150 and ended at 170.

Title: Expensive - there are better apps for this
----------------------------------------------------------
I recommend Lose It as a way better alternative to this app. Lose It is free to try as long as you want and it offers an upgrade to premium at a much lower cost than Noom. The food entry is much better in Lose It than Noom. I find Noom’s food entry confusing. It’s not clear when you’ve added a food. They need a clearer interface. Also, I could not cancel after I realized I’d gone past the trial period. I know it’s my fault for signing up without reading the fine print but I hadn’t yet started using the app and they refused to refund me - so if you choose to use this app beyond the trial, know that you are signing up for $150 for only 6 months. Lose it is $40 for a whole year and I don’t even think the premium version is necessary. The free version is better than Noom. It’s also unclear whether the Noom concierge is a real human or AI. The unresponsiveness makes me think human, but the canned answers to my questions make me think it’s an AI. It has not answered my question asking if it’s a human or AI (another check in the AI column.) The metabolism and nutrition info are not unique enough to justify the price - It’s information readily available for free on the internet.

Title: Leading you on for your money
----------------------------------------------------------
This is horrible. There is a two week trial period, but I stopped after about 10 days because I was so frustrated with what they offered.  It’s basically a glorified calorie counting app.  (Continue below so you don’t get charged) I joined thinking this would be great for me as I travel a lot so it would be helpful for me to have people that I could check in with and get suggestions from and chat with.  After all, that’s what they advertise, right?  I was greeted immediately by someone (don’t remember her title), but I never heard from her again. (That was Step 1)  Might have been a robot for all I know, I’m sure it was auto generated.  Then on to my coach Desiree (Step 2 now) Except that no matter how I explain to her I’m looking for ideas, she tells me they won’t tell anyone what to do, and what are my ideas?   (She ends everything with “tell me your idea”).  I wasn’t asking for her to tell me what to do, but sometimes an idea, suggestion, something I haven’t thought of, might be nice.  You don’t get that here.  Oh, most importantly— just deleting the app DOES NOT STOP THEM FROM CHARGING YOU.  YOU MUST ASK THEM TO TAKE YOU OUT OF THE PROGRAM & GET A CONFIRMATION EMAIL

Title: Ivy League Weight Watchers
----------------------------------------------------------
I have only had this app for a few days of the free trial. I listen to a lot of podcasts, and I have heard a lot about Noom, especially that it is supportive, “customizable” and “the last weight loss program you’ll need”, etc etc. I have struggled with fluctuating weight, body image issues, and eating disorders since I was a kid. My parents have put me on all kinds of strict diets and I’ve put myself on even more outrageous ones. The one time I was able to lose a significant amount of weight and keep it off was after I graduated high school through a combination of intermittent fasting, avoiding processed foods, and measuring progress in inches lost rather than pounds. I’ve tried almost everything, and at this point in my life I can tell another “diet” from a real system of creating positive engrams (and surprise: one app is never what makes the difference). I want to lose weight this summer, and I wanted to try something new. I assumed Noom would be a good ancillary support source. However, I could tell immediately that while Noom does have a positive emphasis on weight loss education, it is not the hail mary miracle program that it advertises itself to be.

Title: Wrong starting place
----------------------------------------------------------
For some reason when I first signed up for the app and input in my initial goal and age, it defaulted me to 40 years old at 172 lbs and 5’4. Except it didn’t tell me that until most of the way through the questions and it kept saying “as a woman in your forties.” I then noticed that the starting places were completely off for me and there no way for me to change it. The only option I am left with is to enter in my credit card info for the free trial for a plan that is not tailored to my age or my weight/height with no way to change it. I wasn’t willing to risk that so I ended up retrying with a different email. This time I made sure to double check that I put in the correct age and weight before moving onto the next step, lo and behold I get to the next step and it tells me that “women in their 20s have a ideal weight between 52 and 72 pounds.” I guess this time it got the age right but that 52-72lbs goal weight must be a mistake. Now I’m not sure if I’ve done something wrong again or if the default goal set to something automatically. I feel like I shouldn’t have to jump through flaming hoops and constantly doubting myself in trying to sign up for an app.

Title: Untrustworthy Business Practices and Poor Customer Service
----------------------------------------------------------
Based on friends who’d had success with Noom, I signed up for a two week trial. The process takes upwards of an hour and you must disclose a great deal of personal information. Upon opening my account information in the app, I saw my trial listed as one week instead of two. I contacted support and after sharing the receipt with the two week trial listed, they insisted on their end it was one. Despite direct evidence from them. Their advice then was to DELETE all of the information I had entered and start over. Not to get the two week offer - this they couldn’t guarantee - but to resolve the data issue on their side presumably. From not honoring the contract to the solution of deleting all my data, this is a terrible jumping off point for a premium priced service. Working with a delicate issue -weight loss - and claiming psychological sophistication in doing it, this company has yet to display basic business practices and customer service. We are at 9 emails, with 3 people (Ricardo, Elsa, and Melissa), and not a single offer to solve the issue for the customer.  As a health professional myself, this one might be a scam, folks. Will update if things change

Title: SCAM! Do NOT Download!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Noom just wants your credit card info, and that’s it. Their customer service is IMPOSSIBLE to get in touch with - the best you can hope for is an automated email response. Even when I called the number listed in PayPal (the only place I could find a number - they don’t list one anywhere on their website or in the app) it just plays a recorded message on repeat. I had issues downloading the app and of course was charged. When I tried to fix it, online it said to contact your coach in the app, and once I was able to do that, she gave me a link back to the website! It’s clear they just want it to be so difficult to cancel that you give up or forget and let them keep charging the exorbitant fee. And forget just paying one month - they charge you four months right out of the gate! It’s really expensive for what it is, even if the service was better. The email form I had to fill out had a section asking “how can we fix this?” and the answer is simple - I want a refund! Until then, I will do everything to negate the fortune they are spending on Facebook and Instagram ads by telling everyone I know (and probably strangers on the street) not to use Noom.

Title: Food Diary/Scale Value
----------------------------------------------------------
It’s just a food diary and weight obsessive with daily weigh ins. This isn’t a good behavioral tactic (although the program is sold as a healthy behavioral system) to obsess over numbers especially starting off in a program. It creates an all or nothing ideal. I thought the idea to the program was to rethink food nutrition and exercise and the relationship our minds and bodies have to each other. Not this calorie counting, weighing daily obsessive thought process to shame people into restrictive eating. Because that is all that creates. To pay extra for workouts and nutrition advice is also suggested so the program actually “works best”. The reason I started the trial was because it advertised mindfulness. You cannot withhold half of something and expect mindfulness. You should at least give nutrition and exercise suggestions straight off instead of just accountability to the daily weigh ins and app use age!!! It’s swindling people. Some people need accountability help which I get is essentially the idea but making it a week long focus primarily based off of food intake and DAILY weigh ins at the beginning is incorrect for behavioral change.

Title: Oversells itself and fails to deliver
----------------------------------------------------------
This review at the moment is more about the app, customer service, technical support, and communication than the actual program which it is difficult to rate at this time due to all the other failures. Signed up several weeks ago on recommendation of a family member. Was told I would have group support, and individual support. It has been three weeks and I have had no support. I also signed up and paid for an add on for meal planning and exercise and have never received any information or contact regarding that plan.The automated dumb dumb’s just keep saying to hit the help button ask for support and when I do they always say give us 2 to 3 minutes to look into it and then you get disconnected and have to start again. This morning was the sixth time I tried to contact them and it was another fail. In addition they have a phone number for phone support but actually there are no phone support people. I have received some emails but they are not helpful because they’re not in the app and there’s no way to follow up with them. Under the circumstances of trying to help peopleThis is really upsetting. I hope somebody reads this and get back to me.

Title: Glitches, can’t use after subscription
----------------------------------------------------------
7/31/21 Despite completing the “sign up and get a personalized plan” survey and then subscribing with auto renewal, the app is stuck on the “change your life now & sign up” page that starts a the personalized plan survey. There is no way to bypass this page.  I’ve verified with Apple that the subscription went thru, I used the Noom FAQ’s to troubleshoot (delete/reinstall/delete/power down phone/power up phone/reinstall), I verified app is updated, that iPhone software is current, and then reset password (to my Noom subscribed email) - got the email to reset and nope, still can’t use the app. Contacted customer support and they cannot see my account, and they say my email is not in their system, but can I try to go into the app account info and send them details from the app- which, as mentioned, I can’t get into because the app is stuck on the initial sign up page. So I went thru the survey again, and again, (and again) and tried to sign up again and it won’t let me because I’m “already subscribed”. Aaaagh! I sent customer care screenshots of everything and details but I don’t think they can figure it out either since I haven’t heard back.

Title: Beware…
----------------------------------------------------------
Noom wasn’t for me. I can see where there may be value for others. Here’s the thing though… I canceled before my trial was over and was instantly charged $44 for a monthly fee. I emailed them and tried to have it reversed. They replied that they didn’t have the right account but it was. I replied back provided more information and explaining I needed a credit. Received an email advising that I hadn’t replied to which I emailed back that I had and copied and pasted the previous email. Received another email saying I hadn’t replied and that they would be considering the matter closed if I didn’t reply within so many day. Replied yet again…. Received an email that they considered it closed due to my lack of response… replied again… crickets!  I googled them and found many, many, many complaints about issues with being charged erroneously.  It seems to be their MO so please be aware if you provide your credit card they will likely charge you even if you cancel. One other thing, when I canceled they instantly sent me an offer to drop the price to $19 a month if I stayed. Just awful. I’m very disappointed with this companies business practices.

Title: Only for younger adults
----------------------------------------------------------
This does not fit the lifestyle of somebody in their late 30s or above. It does not cater to a stay at home mom. I don’t believe they understands how a stay at home mom life is. Makes assumptions like you have french fries with lots of your meals or you eat out at fast food restaurants all the time. Majority of my meals are cooked at home and not from a box I know how to shop at the grocery store. It let’s you know from the beginning that the food you need to buy may not fit in your budget but it’s OK. Like everyone’s rich. I tried to enter in a hot pastrami sandwich that I made at home but it tried to ask me which restaurant it was from. Nowhere for me to enter it in it was from home. It assumes you have a job and ask you questions based on that assumption. Talks to you with the assumption you have a job and no kids. I understand creating healthy habits but not everybody’s life schedule fits in the same. There were comments that I could not relate to, seemed catered to the younger generations. Do not recommend for someone with a actual life if you are married, have children, and a life, this does not cater to you and your personal needs.

Title: Good content, terrible app
----------------------------------------------------------
Lots of people say Noom has changed their lives. I can see how the positive psychology and the content can do that. But he execution of the app is awful. The worst feature is the food logging, which is CRUCIAL to how this program works. They don’t have a robust database of foods like My Fitness Pal does, so you have to manually enter your food or find an equivalent. If you enter details from the box or label, it won’t tell you whether it’s a red, green, or yellow food, which is essential to how you plan meals for the day. The integration with Fitbit doesn’t work so your step count isn’t accurate. The upsell during the onboarding process is not transparent so you don’t know how much you’re actually paying (it’s 4 months up front, not monthly). It’s so hard to find your account and billing information too. You have to message your “virtual coach” in app to do anything account or billing related. They didn’t even have the courtesy to name this virtual coach. The rest of the content is so personal yet this detail was missed. I have so much to say to their product team. Get your product right and stop working on growth hacking!

Title: NOT WORTH MONEY AT ALL!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I had looked into Noom because I was looking for something different to help me with weight loss and keeping fit since other methods I have tried were not working. I started the trial period paying $10 for 2 weeks of “free” trial because I felt that my trainer or whoever it was answering my texts, A REAL PERSON I HOPE, NOT A MACHINE, deserved something for their work and patience with me. But less than 2 weeks in, I felt that the app wasn’t really working for me and I constantly forget that I was even using it. I looked to see if I could cancel and on an iPhone you can look at all your subscriptions in the APP store and see if it auto renews or not or how much longer a trial period will last, BUT when I checked, it DID NOT TELL ME I was on auto renewal; NOR DID IT TELL ME THAT THE NEXT SUBSCRIPTION WAS A ONE TIME PAYMENT OF $130! We are living through PANDEMIC!!!!! SOME PEOPLE DONT HAVE $130 TO WASTE ON AN APP! SOME PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED AND OTHERS THAT ARE WORKING HAVE SHORTER HOURS. THAT MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO BUY GROCERIES/ MASKS/ GLOVES/ HAND SANITIZERS/ BASIC NECESSITIES FOR MY FAMILY AND I!

Title: Lower your expectations: Noom won’t deliver what it promises
----------------------------------------------------------
I was really excited to start this program and enjoyed it for the first month or so. I signed up for the three-month subscription, despite the hefty price, because my health is worth it and I loved the psychology tips. However after they had my money, I realized Noom never actually added me to a group (for two months I got a pop up message saying, “Hold tight, we’re adding you to a group!” but they never did.) I also realizedthe psychology tips were the extent of the program, despite their claims. Where were the coaches, dietitians, and counselors they promised? I got an “on-demand coach” bot (no name) who sent the same canned messages. The tips recycle, and there was never an offer to connect with someone who could coach me on my specific needs. Additionally, the programming is out of touch with real life today. There was no guidance on how to handle the holidays and food-related challenges, plus the suggestions they give (meet with a friend! Go shopping!) are pre-pandemic and aren’t useful for the current situation. So try it, but don’t buy it. They sell you support but leave you out on your own.

Title: So dissatisfied
----------------------------------------------------------
I signed up for noom and told everyone about it because I loved the app so much. I ended the free trial and ofcourse signed up for the first month. My card was declined because my bank did not recognize the charge. I called my bank approved the charge and the payments went through for my Apple Music, iCloud storage, and NOOM. But noom only shows me the free version of the app. I have deleted and reinstalled the app. I have powered my phone on and off. I have logged out and logged back in. All of my progress is gone. All of my saved articles gone. And I can’t even continue. AND I PAID FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION. I was on the phone with Apple support for about an hour and they tried to help me to no avail. You can’t contact anyone at noom there is no phone number. And I have just been going back and forth with someone name Theresa through email and she doesn’t really care about my situation. She has told me to do everything I had already done. Now I receive no response at all. It’s incredibly frustrating because I was so motivated truly loved this app and recommended it to everyone at my gym for nothing!

Title: Terrible sign up
----------------------------------------------------------
Noom needs to fix their app and/or sign up process. I sighed for a year and paid for the trial. I ended up getting a “we ran into a glitch” message and things went downhill from there. I entered my profile multiple times. It asked me for my card information again - after charging me once. Changed the terms of my sign up from 1 year to 6 months without a proportional reduction in price. Oh, and the unnecessary progress bars that make you wait like some serious calculations are happening are plain annoying. The time it takes to build a plan is probably enough time to compute calculations to send a rocket to the moon. While the drama is appreciated, it gets annoying when you have to fill out the form 5 times. I was excited to start this - it’s a pity that their incredibly messy sign up process made me quit within about 5 minutes of signing up. Given how messy this was - I would not be surprised to see a $199 charge in a few days despite the promised cancellation.  I might just have to call my credit company and let them know to block charges from Noom. I just don’t have time for this!

Title: They lie about pricing
----------------------------------------------------------
When signing up I saw that it was $60/month. Ok cool. Bit expensive but I’ll give it a shot. Well my trial ends and lo and behold they charge me $180 at once. FOR AN APP. $180. And they don’t issue any refunds whatsoever. They also make it nearly impossible to cancel your trial. Most things have a cancel plan button hidden somewhere in the program. Noom does not, you have to message your coach then you get an automated response saying they will email you. So essentially you have to wait to cancel on their terms. I like the app, but I would never pay $180 for it for three months. I feel robbed, especially during a time when money isn’t always guaranteed with the pandemic. This company has a D rating from the BBB with nearly 1800 similar complaints. If you decide to get this app and don’t intend to spend $180 for a three month subscription I would recommend starting to try and cancel at least 3-4 days before the end of your trial. I have already told all of the people I know that use this app to cancel and I will ensure no one I know ever uses it or tries it out. Absolutely horrific.

Title: Misleading Advertisements. It’s a Diet.
----------------------------------------------------------
This is just a calorie counting app with clever marketing, canned coach replies for the most part, and some (in my opinion) condescending articles thrown in. This would be fine if they didn’t attempt to market themselves as an anti-diet when they clearly encourage heavily restricted eating. They will say that they don’t, but asking you to log everything you eat and weigh yourself daily tells the real story. There is a lot of mixed messaging about how it’s okay to eat what you crave and no food is bad, but their stoplight style food logging method clearly leads you to think of certain foods as bad (red with a danger exclamation point when you go over your small calorie “allowance”). What they don’t mention in their promotional material is that 99% of people don’t continue with the program and are therefore not used in their weight loss success calculations. There are also zero studies to back up their claims of long term, sustained weight loss. I’m shocked to hear anecdotally that some doctors are recommending this app. Avoid if you don’t want to develop disordered eating habits.

Title: Disappponting
----------------------------------------------------------
The tone of this program just wasn’t for me. They try to be humorous but they fall short. They talk in acrynoms and hashtags, which I found annoying. But really the short falls are in what they promise. You’re supposed to have a personal goal specialist but I heard from them once and even that message looked like a computer generated message. The daily tasks talked about how I should have set a goal with my specialist but I hadn’t heard from them. You’re supposed to have group support but I was never added to a group. The daily tasks will spend 2-3 sentences discussing something new and days later they will refer back to it like you should be a expert now and have that task as part of your new normal routine. Ultimately this is just tracking your meals and you’re losing weight by dramatic calorie cutting. Nothing new here. Also I bought the Custom Meal and Workout Plan that is anything but custom. It’s a pdf that has blank pages at the end for you to customize your own plan. They do not customize a plan for you. I feel very ripped off by this. Overall extremely disappointed.

Title: Cancelled, and I was still charged.
----------------------------------------------------------
Zoom was not for me, cost was to high and I found it was not something I had time to finish daily. I could not sync my Fitbit as well. It is a good app, just not for me. I cancelled the subscription and turned off Auto renewal and received confirmation it was cancelled. When I cancelled, they offered me a lower price which I declined. I deleted the app. and did a feedback survey. But, two weeks later I received an email saying I haven’t been on the app lately and wanted to know why?  OMG! My credit card was still charged. They charged at the highest rate for four months!!!! What is wrong with the system!! What a stressful situation. I called and they, thank goodness, started a refund and I am waiting for my refund to go through. Still concerned until the money is back in my account. There must be a glitch in the system. But when it is cancelled it should be done without this happening. It makes me mistrust any future dealings for this app and many apps in general. Cancelled means cancelled. Don’t charge any more. There should be a safeguard to prevent unauthorized charges.

Title: Terrible Customer Support
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is honestly a joke. Half of those god reviews have to be paid for, or they’re from rich people who don’t care about the fee that they’ll charge you no matter WHAT you do. Your goal specialist contacts you maybe once a week, and there is legit 0 customer support. Their customer support is in their app and on their website. You can “submit an inquiry” that you won’t get a response to. It took me 30 minutes just to find a phone number to call after being charged $119 which put my account in -60 AFTER THE FACT I had stated to my “goal specialist” that if there wasn’t a way to pay off that fee in monthly payments like the app states I could everywhere but the fine print then I would not be able to continue using the service. He was completely unhelpful in the fact as an employee he didn’t even know anything about if I could do so or not so I submitted the inquiry instead. I haven’t heard back from the app STILL. I filed a complaint with the BBB, and a claim with my bank against a fraudulent withdraw. I cannot believe the lack of organization this company has.

Title: Noom has a LONG way to go. Not as advertised.
----------------------------------------------------------
I was very excited to try noom and ended up getting a subscription. I soon started to notice that the goals specialist and later group coach was not responsive and weeks would go by without a response. I understand they work 9-5, but getting ghosted by a “coach” for weeks? Not okay. The articles at first were helpful but then started to get extemely repetitive and not in a “practice makes perfect” way, in a “we don’t know what else to write about for 4 months” kind of way. Not only that, but the app is riddled with spelling errors! As a marketer and writer, this probably bothers me more than it would others but, come on. About two month in I had an emergency and had to move states so I had my curriculum reset. However it took a week and then I was off in my group. Overall I don’t think it’s ready for the masses and they’re going to have to make a lot of improvements, especially to the awful food logging feature (and I mean AWFUL), before I would ever consider testing it out again. It’s a great concept but execution and frankly, expertise, is a huge miss.

Title: Complete waste of money.
----------------------------------------------------------
Noom is my biggest waste of money in recent years. First of all, it doesn’t count macro nutrients, just labels foods green, yellow, or red. Calculating macros is a huge component of counting calories and a caloric deficit, so the fact that it doesn’t have a way to account for those is a huge red flag. The program stretches itself out way longer than it needs to be in order to keep charging you $60/month. I took it seriously for the first 2 months. But I realized that it repeats the same lessons and little scripts and quizzes over and over again, just worded slightly differently each time to seem original. The group chat feature is toxic; it’s just a bunch of people lying about what they are accomplishing to seek approval from strangers they’re never going to meet in real life. There are no bad days in the group chat, which is not an accurate reflection of life. If it was possible to give it zero stars I would. Save yourself $240 and instead get a macronutrient counter and a gym membership. Once I made that switch I actually started to see results.

Title: Deceptive bill and Weight watchers clone.
----------------------------------------------------------
Essentially Noom is a weight watcher clone in where they revamp the “point” system into one that is color coded based on levels of fullness. There is included a “health” coach that I was sure was a bot offering mediocre and cliche statements like, “how will it feel to you to reach your idea weight?”. Mostly open ended questions to seem like they are engaged in tour progress. Obviously, the program is still based on a daily caloric limit with a food scanner and search option. Again basically a revision of weight watchers with some reworking so they don’t infringe on copy rights. My contention with NOOM is the initial trial will cost you $10 a week then after the trial period you are automatically charge the annual rate of $168. Deceptive practice in my opinion.  How many times have you started a trial only to forget and be charged. NOOM takes that to the next level. I filed complaint with the Pennsylvania Attorney General, Josh Shapiro. I would encouraged any other users affected by the unscrupulous billing practices of NOOM to do like wise.

Title: Obnoxious!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is the most obnoxious app I have ever tried to use. The upbeat cheerleader style is not my thing, and the elementary level vocabulary and tone made it even worse. It really reminded me of the "educational" game websites my kids' teachers assigned to them when they were in elementary that they truly hated. I definitely see their point. Very basic information that they make you click through and tell them you're excited about (um, no.) Plus all the generalized assumptions about you your motivation. For a "personalized" app, it's pretty impersonal. And if the coaches aren't actually bots, they do a truly excellent job of playing one. Also, telling me to eat 1200 calories a day?! And asking me if I need help getting motivated to stick to that? I tried that for months already and it doesn't work. I need a minimum of 1500 to lose weight. Any less, and my metabolism shuts down. If they bothered to make their questionnaire a little more detailed and really look at individual people, I could have easily told them that. Waste of time and money.

Title: The app is awful
----------------------------------------------------------
The scanner is wrong a lot so I have to check what I scan and usual change the calories to make the food box. The food calories are usually wrong. I never got the water tracker or the course progress. Tech support was no help. At first they claimed no one had the water tracker. But I knew people did. When I showed them they said wait 2 days. After waiting 5 days I went back to them for help got the same answer. Over 2 month never got tracker. Later found out there was a course progress that isn’t on my app. I chat with tech to have the girl say I need to chat with tech. Even though I selected them. There customer support id awful. My coach just gives me links of old Noom articles instead of actually having a conversation and making suggestions. My group is all people putting there workouts so you miss the conversations. The articles after awhile feel like your doing the same thing over and over. The concept is great and if you follow you’ll lose weight.  But the app has way to many problems and there customers support needs a lot of help.

Title: Not worth the money
----------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, I paid the money for this app and was not pleased with what it provided. The cost of this app is supposed to pay for a goal specialist, and I barely received anything more than “bot” type automated messages. I wanted something personal to keep me motivated and this wasn’t it. I also was not impressed with them having you weigh yourself everyday. It is not a healthy habit, and it can really cause some people to spiral in a bad direction. They would mark things like a salad as a “yellow” food, meaning they didn’t think it was that great for me because of calorie density. Overall I’m not pleased with this app, but unfortunately I have paid through until May because they automatically took money from my bank account on the last day of the 2 week trial (I had planned on cancelling that morning but they already subtracted the funds from my bank account). This app just does not seem like a healthy app to choose, especially for those who previously struggled with eating disorders. Weighing yourself every day is NOT the way to go!!!

Title: My reasoning
----------------------------------------------------------
First when I got pulled in by the ads etc to try this app out, they told me the trial for 2 weeks would be free, however after going through all the tabs with signing up they asked what I though would be fair to pay to trial the and I thought to myself that the only reason I wanted try this app was for the free trial, so you mean to tell me it’s not actually free? And of course there was not an option to say try for free,  you had to pick an amount and pay that amount, although they did give down to a dollar that you could choose, but FREE means FREE! Anyway, I actually can’t comment very much on the app as this was just not the right time to trial the app so I had to cancel my subscription. Instead of them allowing for me to finish out the trial version, and who knows maybe I would’ve changed my mind about cancelling if I got the hang of using it, they cancelled it and I don’t have the access for the remainder of the trial which doesn’t make sense. There’s my review. Maybe this will work for others but I don’t believe I’ll try it again.

Title: Awful Customer Service
----------------------------------------------------------
I never write reviews but I was so appalled by the lack of customer support that I felt it was important to share my experience. I downloaded the app after signing up for the 14 day free trial. I explored the app a bit and didn’t think it was worth the expense. I had decided to cancel my subscription at the end of the 14 days (which by the way is impossible to figure out how to cancel your subscription). Unfortunately due to a serious family emergency on the last day of subscription I forgot to cancel. The next day I immediately contacted my coach and explained what happened. She turned off my auto renewal but said someone would email me to discuss my concerns over being reimbursed. Someone eventually reached out to me and said I canceled too late and would not be reimbursed. I replied explaining the stressful situation that lead to me canceling a day late - that was two days ago and I have still not received any follow up. Even if they can’t reimbursed me for a program that I will not use, they should have the decency to email me back.

Title: Terrible service, claimed I didn’t create a account only to charge me 3wks later
----------------------------------------------------------
I signed up for the trial or so I thought I did the very first day the app and sign-up process did not go very well automatically I entered my credit card information and there was a pre-authorization sent to my bank the same day that I created the account. I then tried to sign into the account to view I was unable to access it so I contacted customer support and I was told that I did not have an account even with my email address on the last four digits of my credit card and my name. I contacted customer support multiple times on the day that I signed up January 6, I was told there is no such account sound and then I was not billed. There are so many menus, circles and subcategories to make it really difficult for you to locate help or answers to cancel subscription you can’t get a live person or help navigating the app via email and if you don’t check early daily they are likely to close the case as resolved. Today’s date as I write this review I still have not received a refund or close account or been able to get anyone to help.

Title: Good system but terrible customer service and tech support.
----------------------------------------------------------
I had this app exactly 3 days. I signed up for the six month program and paid in advance. I also paid for the exercise and meal plan. Also ordered the DNA kit. I received email receipts for the tracking plan and the exercise and meal plan. But they had run out of the DNA kit. My bank showed a charge only for the meal plan, not the main tracking  plan So after a few days, features started disappearing from my screen. I messaged tech support and they said my account was closed. Apparently my bank assumed fraud because of multiple charges and only allowed one. Never got an email from noom or any indication there was a problem. I messaged and got some lame customer support. Sorry you’ll have to create a new account. Only you can’t. I kept being redirected to the same account info. Tried to delete the app and start over but that didn’t work.  No one would help, I think customer support was automated. Terrible customer support. Terrible communication. Might be a good system but I’ll never know because they have the worst customer service.

Title: Waste of money - SCAM
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is NOT worth it if you have any knowledge on diet and exercise. I tend to fluctuate in a 10 lb range and just wanted a program that would help me lose the 10 and keep it off for good. I thought with the “psychology” aspect it offered something slightly different, but it’s way off. The tasks they provide are simple and once complete the app does not appear to save it, so my daily article or task has been the same thing for two weeks straight now, despite reporting this to my goal specialist. The food logging system is basic and NOT user friendly. MyFitnessPal is a free and WAY better app to use if you are self-motivated and have some basic nutritional knowledge. They base their plan largely on density of food but completely neglect other important nutritional aspects. I’m sorry but I do not feel bad eating raisins and chia seeds - don’t care if they are “red” foods. Lastly, I agree with other comments that the specialist appears robotic. And I too have not been set up in any kind of group. Frankly, this feels like a SCAM.

Title: Load of bull crap
----------------------------------------------------------
I purchased the 14 day trial for $1, canceled subscription, and deleted the app after two days. But after a month, they somehow charged me $129 for a four month subscription. Disputed this on my credit card but the merchant responded with “confirmation with no cancellation policy”. First of all, no cancellation policy is illegal with the consumer protection bureau. Secondly, I did not make this purchase; they applied it automatically after my 14 day trial even though I cancelled and deleted the app. Third, the purchase history is nonexistent on apple store because they charge you independently, which is very very sketchy. All of these make this company highly suscipious of being a legit business and feels more of a scam of some sort. There are a lot of apps out there that are better built than this app that basically get the things you are seeking from this app done for no price or very low price (certainly not $60 for a month). So do not purchase this app! I’ll be filing a formal complaint to the Consumer Protection Bureau soon.

Title: Had a hard time cancelling
----------------------------------------------------------
I signed up for the trial and just didn’t have the time to dedicate to really trying Noom’s services. I tried to log onto my account portal to cancel, but I got a loading page that never loaded. Unfortunately I was charged the 2-month fee because I couldn’t figure out how to cancel. I messaged my goal specialist asking how to check when my 2 months is up and was instructed to log into my account portal which, again, would never load after entering my log-on info. I’ve tried several times to log in through my phone and I get the same error. I finally logged on through my computer and was able to cancel. This is very concerning to me as this is a mobile-based app, but I can’t access my account info through my mobile device. I’ve messaged the company with my issue and strongly suggested to look into this error as it’s deceiving to consumers, especially those that want to cancel. Now I’m stuck with a $99 2-month membership that I know I’m not going to use but was unable to cancel because of technical difficulties with their website.

Title: Not happy with this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been charged $180 for an app that is constantly glitching/crashing I downloaded this app on my old phone and wasn’t able to use it. After signing up for the free trial, which had its own issues, this app went haywire. I was constantly being logged off or the app would just close on me. Eventually it wouldn’t even open. I’d press the app and it would act like it was going to open but then it would close. I couldn’t even get it up to cancel my subscription. I just got a new phone and it did the same thing a few times but I was able to cancel my subscription. Unfortunately they’ve already charged me $180 because I wasn’t able to cancel before the trial period ended. Even though it wasn’t my fault their app wasn’t working on my phone, I’m not eligible for a refund. I don’t recommend this app to anyone. I do suggest that Noom reconsiders it’s refund policy, especially since it charges you for 8 months of time. So I have a useless subscription for a questionable app that I have no interest in trying to see how often it may work.

Title: Total Scam - Don’t waste your money
----------------------------------------------------------
Similar to other comments in the 1-2 star range, I found Noom to be super motivating and helpful for weight loss at the start of the program. I read the articles, got involved with the group, and talked to my coach on a regular basis. After a few weeks I started to lose interest in the app and the content seemed to be fairly repetitive. I got a notice from Noom saying that I was being removed for inactivity so I assumed this was my cancellation and deleted the app. Side note - It’s super awkward to cancel because you have to send a message to your coach - there’s no way to do that elsewhere in the app.  After not opening the app for months I was charged a subscription fee without warning. I sent a message to my coach and to the support team and they told me a refund was not possible, but that I can “continue to enjoy using the app until my subscription ends.” They can check my message and usage history - clearly this is a standard response. I expected better from this company. Super disappointing. Don’t waste your time/money.

So sorry for the confusion! Please know that no longer using Noom isn't a means of canceling your subscription, which is why you need to let your goal specialist know that you would to cancel. Thanks for sharing your experience with us!

Title: Boring and repetitive, thieves
----------------------------------------------------------
I could have downloaded a calorie counter for free. Their daily advice is repetitive and time consuming. I suppose if you want to be nagged into exercising and eating right, it works. If you are just looking for a good way to track calories, this app is not worth the money. I am also extremely upset with their billing practices. The idea is that you sign up for whatever length of time they determine it will take you to reach your goal. Then if you fail to cancel before the free trial is up you pay a flat fee for the service for that pre-determined amount of time. What they fail to tell you is that the service auto renews after that period of time has passed. why would you need to auto renew this service if the whole idea is that you’ll reach your goal by the end of the period you paid for initially. And why keep this information a secret.  Every other app I have used with an auto renew sends a reminder before they charge you again, but not Noom. If they have such great results than why the deceptive billing practices?

Title: A lot of content, not well programmed
----------------------------------------------------------
I feel the Noom program is not well-enough thought out or implemented. I especially dislike having to interface solely through the phone, where many of the charts are too small to see. If Noom can hire the programming power to be able to do same work through a web interface that would be useful. I also dislike how the answers to the questions in the exercises are not available to refer to at a later time. That, plus worries about security of your systems make me reluctant to provide real answers to the questions, thereby reducing the usefulness of the exercises. I would also note that the exercises you get to by month five are things that should have come much earlier. The “Noomnerd” stream of consciousness over the course has been wandering all over the place. It took me over four months to realize I could even get a personal trainer, rather than having to share in a group session—which, again, has online security issues for me. All-in-all not a well-developed curriculum or interface for the amount of money spent.

Title: System flawed gives bad health advice
----------------------------------------------------------
The US nutritional guidelines have been wrong for 50 years making us all fatter, diabetic with a host of ailments not common before like Chrones, IBS, etc.  Making grains and especially the switch to whole grains the base of the pyramid along with low fat every thing is just plain wrong.  Switching from animal fat to vegetable oils was equally bad.  Where do you think trans fats came from?  Fruit year round all day everyday? Also making you fat.  Calories in calories out does not account for hormones and hormone disruptors.  So when whole almonds are red foods in Noom and pasta is yellow you will be steered to making ill informed decisions about what to eat.  I adopted these nutritional guidelines lost weight, got gall bladder disease as a direct result, had surgery to remove my gall bladder and couldn’t get the hormone to feel satiated.  I gained all the weight back times two!  Only fasting, eliminating lectins, eating fruit only in season will work.  I have zero intention to make the same mistake twice.  Read:

Title: Not Customizable
----------------------------------------------------------
I paid extra for the meal plan and exercise plan.  What a waste. After my phone meeting with a “specialist” I was sent a canned exercise plan and diet that did not take into consideration that I chose the Keto diet or that I had back and knee problems. In addition, they collected money for their partner plan Suggestic, which couldn’t even accept food logging. So I’d have to log my food in Noom instead of Suggestic, which offered the Keto plan, and clearly showed that you could log the food before I bought it. They were selling the programs together, so I thought that was the customizable meal portion of the app. NO. They sent me a paper diet that said one starch, one protein, one fat, etc. per meal. Nothing about Keto. Then, I was not placed in a group for weeks, and then finally, a “quiet” group.  So frustrating. Maybe a good app if you’ve never been on a diet before, but nothing novel. Complete waste of money and in the end more stressful that it was worth. Liking FB Keto groups and Carb Tracker much more.

Title: Couldn’t get past setup
----------------------------------------------------------
Went through an extensive 20-minute questionnaire, subscribed to free trial with $44.95/mo charge after expiration. Clicked “ok” on Apple payment received prompt. Looped me back to the beginning of the questionnaire. Force closed, restarted phone, all answers were saved so I clicked back through the dozens of screens and “plan loading” stalls, resubmitted acceptance of free trial, got Apple prompt that I was already subscribed followed by Noom UI processing payment error. Uninstalled/deleted Noom app, unsubscribed from Noom via Apple ID, restarted phone, reinstalled Noom, went through questionnaire again (this time approximately half of data was saved), confirmed payment was saved again “Youre all set”, took me right back to the beginning of the questionnaire. Again. There’s no way out of that page other than to go through the questionnaire. No thank you. Last thing I need is another buggy, time consuming app that has to be handheld through basic functionality. Too bad. I had high hopes and an open wallet.

Title: Noom is a diet scam
----------------------------------------------------------
Check out BBB reviews and reviews on the internet before trying this App.  Most users have trouble contacting the company to cancel the free trial, and continue to have trouble canceling the membership.  The one-on-one coaching is an AI bot of very little use which makes the personal support and coaching, very impersonal.  (What little human support you do get is not from trained coaches, nutritionists and psychologists as advertised but appears to be from off-shore). The food logging is cumbersome and due to their red/yellow/green strategy does not sync with other food logging apps.  I never really thought about how good my fitness pal is but when trying to describe how bad Noom is I keep thinking " food is so much easier to log in MFP". Exercise calorie credit is tracked so much better in MFP.   The meal plan and tips and tricks are so much better in MFP.  Anyway.... Noom is a huge waste of money and potentially a lot more money than you planned on due to their scam-worthy credit card billing practices.
