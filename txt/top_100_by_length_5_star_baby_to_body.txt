Title: Love this App!
----------------------------------------------------------
So far, I am SO happy with this app. It‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for in my pregnancy to help encourage and motivate me to stay healthy and active. I opted to pay the money so I could use the fitness portion and I am not disappointed. I needed fairly easy and fast workouts that made me feel like I got a little workout with not too much intensity to make it hard on me in my third trimester AND shorter workouts since I‚Äôm busy running after my 2 year old at the same time. I‚Äôm a beginner when it comes to consistently working out and ‚Äúmedically‚Äù overweight for my height, so I like how simple they make it to follow along and workout in each trimester without it being too advanced to follow. I appreciated the videos portion in the fitness section and that it will link to Spotify for music to workout along to. I love all the little tips and advice and recipes. Overall- I think this is totally worth the monthly payment to add onto my yoga workouts and walking. I really enjoy it and recommend it to any of my preggo mommy friends! Thank you for this app!

Title: Great app for Prego Mamas
----------------------------------------------------------
I really enjoy using this app! I‚Äôm currently in my 25th week of pregnancy and have been using it for over a week now. I love that the workouts fit the week of pregnancy I am in, so I know my baby and I are safe completing them. I also like that you can stream music in the background (I use Amazon) or use your Spotify playlist. The workouts are all less than 30 minutes, so I‚Äôm able to complete them in the morning before work and my toddler waking up. They use minimal equipment I have already in my basement, or it‚Äôs easily supplemented with something else. For example, I don‚Äôt have a step, so I used my stairs. I really haven‚Äôt worked out much this pregnancy, but I‚Äôm going all out for the third trimester thanks to this app. I wish I had downloaded this app sooner! There are also lots of helpful articles and recipes. It may be cool to have some kind of communication set up with the ladies using this app, like a way to connect with other moms using the app also in week 25. Just a thought. üòä Thanks!

Title: I love this app!  A bit pricy, but so worth it.
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app. The workouts are easy and fun. I am not someone who enjoys exercising, but this app keeps me motivated. I‚Äôve never had an issue with bugs or glitches (surprisingly considering I have an older iPhone), and I just love the general layout of the app. Everything is easy to find, and there‚Äôs a ton to do. You get a new selection of workouts every week, and most of them you need little to no equipment for. There‚Äôs also tons of other features like a period and ovulation tracker, different meal recipes each week, and a ton more. My husband and I are currently trying for our first, and there‚Äôs even a setting specifically for women trying to conceive.

Title: Love love love it!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is great! It lets you pause when you need to and come back to where you left off or even start over again if you want. It‚Äôs reasonably priced. Love the option to link to Spotify my personal opinion I wish it connected to Pandora. The only thing that I‚Äôm noticing is that when I complete a workout it will show that I completed it directly after I do but when I open back up the app it doesn‚Äôt show that I completed it. Other than that it‚Äôs a wonderful app that works you up gradually which is great especially when your as out of shape as I am. I‚Äôm curious though if the workouts grow with you and become more intense.

Title: Love It !
----------------------------------------------------------
Becoming a mom-to-be for the very first time is an amazing roller coaster ride . The amount of apps I have downloaded for this baby are definitely in the double digits but I have deleted some of them , I kept this one around because it‚Äôs the full package ! There‚Äôs Zen breathing which I just began doing ( it really helps ) , meal and recipe ideas , and full workouts ( did one today ! üí™üèæ broke a sweat and I felt amazing ) designed to your fitness level . You get a lot for it to be a free app but you get even more with the in app purchases ! I recommend this app to anybody that‚Äôs on their way to motherhood

Title: Awesome App
----------------------------------------------------------
I am on week 10 when I found this app and everyday before then I had no motivation to workout and kept eating all kinds of crazy unhealthy cravings. I wasn‚Äôt fully eating good when I started the excercises but this changed my mood and gave me more energy to endure this pregnancy. I started eating healthy little at a time and used their food suggestions on this app to slowly get me back on the right track. I feel amazing and some days I‚Äôm lazy but i love the simple and short workouts. They still kick my butt and everyday I feel stronger using this app. It‚Äôs awesome.

Title: This app keeps you motivated
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is amazing for pregnant women feeling lost on what things to eat, which work outs are safe, and it keeps you wanting to stay on track! It‚Äôs super important to eat healthy to FEEL good. Specially in the first trimester. Which in my opinion it‚Äôs the worst time during pregnancy because hormones can really take a toll on how you feel. I feel extremely tired and sick if I don‚Äôt work out and get good foods in my body, so this app teaches you different recipes that will help you through ‚Äúmorning sickness‚Äù which is all day sickness for me.

Title: Easy to follow workouts
----------------------------------------------------------
It‚Äôs tough to dig through all the prenatal apps out there, but Baby2Body offers easy to follow video workouts that you can take with you on the go... to the gym, beach, living room, wherever. It can also be confusing as your pregnancy progresses to know what exercises are safe and accessible while still challenging. They tailor to your fitness level and desired frequency. I also love the pelvic floor exercise timer and recipe options. Worth paying for, but it‚Äôs great that they have free content available as well.

I absolutely love this app. I would recommend it to anyone that is pregnant for sure. I love everything about it... I would recommend if possible to add other music platforms to sync to the app as well. I love the zen den and visualizations if there were multiple visualization breathing exercises you could choose from per week that would be so nice. I‚Äôve been doing this to relax me after your recommended workout for the day and I absolutely love them. Thank you so much for creating such a wonderful app!!!!

If you download this def use it to your advantage this app has so much to offer. I wish it had an option to save workouts, that‚Äôs the only thing other than that it‚Äôs great!

I‚Äôm loving doing these workouts every morning. I‚Äôm super early in my first pregnancy and was trying to find an app that knew what I should do to stay fit and be safe for my baby!

Definitely worth the $6.99 a month price tag! The ‚Äúthought of the day‚Äù quote helped me get through a lot of challenging and exhausted days during my pregnancy and postpartum period. My only complaint is that I can‚Äôt listen to music on my phone while following the workout. Makes working out at the gym a little boring since I enjoy working out to music. Overall, a great app with lots of yummy recipes, helpful tips, and great advice for staying emotionally, physically and mentally strong ‚ô•Ô∏è

Hi a_manderss - we're so happy to hear you like the app! We did want to let you know that you can listen to music while doing your Baby2Body workouts as well :) All you need to do is make sure the Connect with Spotify button is on (turned green) before you press Start on your selected workout. If you don't have Spotify, you can also start playing music on your phone before launching the Baby2Body app and Fitness Studio and it should keep playing while you're using the app. I do hope this helps! As always, feel free to reach out to us at team@baby2body.com if you have any further questions.

I found this app during the last week of my second trimester. I am SO disappointed I did not find it sooner! As a very athletic woman trying to maintain fitness through pregnancy I was ecstatic to FINALLY find an app with real workouts that are challenging and yet safe to do. The advice and daily tips are absolutely wonderful compared to the outdated advice I found in other apps. Seriously, this app is worth every penny of the small cost.

----------------------------------------------------------
Just starting out and I feel amazing. I love how they are starting me off slow. I feel like when I have other people try to get me to start working out they push me to hard to where I don‚Äôt wanna work out again. This is definitely the start of something good.
