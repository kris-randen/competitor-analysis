Title: Awfully small database
----------------------------------------------------------
The concept is great which is why I ended up buying a one year membership but you either have to cook all your meals (which I often do on weekdays) or buy a meal at a very unhealthy store like McDonalds or taco bell or a packaged frozen dinner (which is very unhealthy and they acknowledge it too) for them to figure out your calorie intake. There is no middle ground. I went out to a Mexican place for lunch today as it’s the weekend and shared a plate of nachos with my friend but there’s no way of estimating my calorie consumption unless I know the portion size of each ingredient unless I am willing to go eat at tacobell. Their grocery list is also very small, most of the healthier brands don’t appear on their database. So I would have to either type in my calorie intake manually or buy a mass produced alternative listed in their database, neither of which sounds appealing to me. If you expect me to use the app everyday for a long time, you should make it super easy to add my consumption and estimate my calorie intake. I am just a week in to my membership and I already regret my purchase.

Thanks for your detailed feedback and suggestions. The health tracker includes a feature that is exactly what you need. It's called "QUICK" and lets you quickly add a calorie estimate to your daily intake. If you need further help, please email support@fooducate.com

Title: System is off a few beats
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is definitely on to something great but the execution needs some work. Categories need their own rating system. You can't rate all sugars a c because they are sugars. I want an f through a rating for sugars where the best sugars in their category are an A and the worst are an F. I don't want all sugars to be a C because they are just sugars. You can't put 100% pure maple syrup at a c and then also put corn syrup at a c. Same goes for baby formula. No formula gets better then a c because "breast milk is the best". That may be true but breast milk is not a formula so the ratings shouldn't be compared to breast milk. They should be compared to the ingredient list vs other ingredients in other formulas. I've only used the app a little bit but I've already found several cases like this. I'm sure there are many more.

Title: Could be great with a few fixes
----------------------------------------------------------
At first I thought this app was fantastic. A great alternative to weight watchers with an even better explanation of each food's nutrition, and still a points system to count the value of your food instead of just the calories. This was great, EXCEPT it doesn't have food points for every item. In fact because it's based on user input, most unpackaged items that I put on my list didn't have an adequate amount of nutrition facts therefore the app couldn't calculate the point value. It's kind of useless to my diet if I can't count the points of every thing that I eat. I was using fitness pal but I don't want to count calories because it's not as productive as point values. Anyway, I'm deleting the app, but if they update the system and assign point values to everything, then I would totally use it religiously.

Title: Pro version is useless
----------------------------------------------------------
I decided to do the subscription because the concept sounded great. It lets you customize your health conditions on your profile and shows you a breakdown of the nutrients of the food you have eaten that day, but that’s as good as the pro version gets. Although you can customize your health conditions it does not change the recipes that it shows you to cater to those health conditions which is pointless. All of the recipes they show are entered in by the community and they just show the most recent or most popular they do not let you even customize it yourself to show what kind of recipes you want to see based on your diet. It all honestly looks kind of random and you have to spend forever searching for what you are looking for. Any other health app would be better.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, thanks for your feedback. The premium PRO features include Nutrient tracking (carbs, sugars, sodium, etc.), Health tracking (heart healthy, lower blood pressure, etc.) and dietary preferences (avoid GMOs, Paleo Diet, Vegan, etc). We have just released additional profiles to our app, including kidney disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, PCOS, FODMAP, and an Allergy and Gluten feature which allows the detection and avoidance of major allergens in food products. Unfortunately recipes are not central to the app; they are an add-on added by our robust community.

Title: Hate the notifications
----------------------------------------------------------
I use Fooducate to educate myself on healthy food choices and it worked great for this purpose. For some reason the app creators have recently decided it would be a good idea to send the notification "Please log your meals. Even a few is fine." incessantly. I am considering deleting the app because of this. Not only is this notification pointless and intrusive, it is passive aggressive and condescending - two things I never thought I would say about a phone notification! As a physician I do not have the time or inclination to log my meals because someone else thinks it is good for me. Please allow me to use the app in the way I feel it is most useful to my lifestyle. And don't treat your customers like children.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
The notification frequency is set by the user, which means you can disable notifications altogether if you wish. You may have changed this setting by mistake. To change it again, Tap on the MENU, then on MY PROFILE to reach this setting.

Title: Better off reading the label
----------------------------------------------------------
I purchased this to help me navigate food allergens and to track my caloric intake. In my experience, the app doesn’t have a wide database of items so you’re left looking at the label anyways and inputting all the nutrition info manually into the app, or you have to rely on data another user has input (didn’t want to risk it with allergens). Great idea, I just wish they had more in their database. That may have made it a 3 star, but then I tried to cancel one of the paid premium parts of the app and I still can’t figure it out. It’s either a very non user friendly app unintentionally, or they’re making it extremely hard to cancel on purpose. For those two reasons, I have to give this the lowest rating.

Title: All wrong!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app helps you read nutritional facts which the easiest way to read a label. It needs to break down ingredients into what’s good and what’s not. That’s where most of society has the biggest problem! Simply reading nutritional facts will not lead to a healthy life style. This is what Americans have been taught to do and this app is simply fostering the idea that that is how you know if a processed product is good or not. I have looked in the app extensively and it doesn’t recognize any harmful ingredients used by Food producers today. It seems to think if the product is low calorie and low sugar, it’s something you should stick with... WRONG. It kills me that this app is getting a good rating..

Title: You don't deserve a ban
----------------------------------------------------------
I speak the truth and mostly the truth. Well this app doesn't like honest opinions so it banned me for saying what I thought was true. The whole point of the app is to learn, but clearly they'll ban you if you say something "incorrectly". I didn't offend the person, curse at the person, I just gave my honest opinion about the food they ate. If they don't like my honesty, instead of a fake statement such as "wow how healthy, looks delicious" then they can go and do business with themselves. If you like to be fake and give fake opinions, then download it, otherwise stay very, very far away from it. This app deserves every 1 star rating it can get.

Title: Terrible
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is absolutely horrible. I don’t know why were paying 30 some dollars a year to do all the work. They don’t have foods entered into the system that are very popular. So for most foods you have to wait for it to show up in the system. The only foods that show up are the junk food that you’re trying not to eat anyway. Also the inner face really makes you not want to enter your food. To say it’s frustrating would be an understatement. It’s absolutely terrible. I will not be renewing at the end of the year. There’s got to be some app cobbled together by an elementary student for science fair that is better than this.

Title: DO NOT UPDATE THIS APP!
----------------------------------------------------------
I loved this app, but not anymore.  Now they require you to register to use it.  Sure, they say it's free, but it's a way to farm information from people that they can then sale to another source.  I value my privacy too much and I'm deleting it as soon as this is finished.  However, if you want to continue to use it, just don't update the app.  The old one will continue to work until they figure out a way to fix that.  I've done this on several apps.  They are still working.  Delete the app from your phone and don't update your computer.  Then reinstall the original version.  So far, It's worked every time.

Title: Tons of missing food & inaccuracies
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought the premium version of this app ($40) to replace myfitnesspal and have something that gives better information about each food. It's such a great concept except a lot of the foods I scan are not in their system so I'm then prompted to add it for them. Then when foods are in the system they are very often wrong nutrition info including stating they are non vegetarian when they really are or saying their are GMOs when there are not. On top of that my scanner only works about half the time. So I paid $40 to use an app that barely works and I am spending time adding foods for them. I'm so disappointed.

I emailed with Lisa at Contact Us but she could not answer the simple question...Is the search feature going to be up graded..instead she gave me a list of commands to follow to get to STEAK. No I don't want steakums and every other processed food with the word steak. Save your money and use My Fitness Pro. I am going back there.

Title: Very limited database of foods
----------------------------------------------------------
While the app has the capability to provide a lot of information, it falls short due to the very limited and frequently inaccurate database.  For example, a boiled egg has anywhere from 0-160 calories. The location feature is great. But the grading system is far more subjective than objective. The articles are simply a facade for advertising which I thought my $9.99 got rid of. The biggest real pet peeve I have is that the predictive spelling is disabled. If the developers can get the database up to par with my fitness pal and get rid of all advertising, I'll gladly give them more stars.

I loved this app and recommended it to a lot of people but in the recent upgrade, I have to create an account. I used to be able to save lists to my phone but I no longer have that option. I do not like creating an account for every app I download...it's just one more password to remember or get stolen. Facebook is an option, but I prefer not to use that either. It worked just fine storing the data locally, please give us that option back. In the mean time, if you don't want to create an account to just use an app, I suggest finding other app as I will be doing.

Title: Free the gluten free!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a wonderful app but if you’re allergic to anything (which is not and individual’s choice) you are required to purchase an extension. I was diagnosed celiac 10 years ago when gluten free was basically unheard of. It wasn’t until a few years ago I was able to order a pizza that wouldn’t kill me and I didn’t have to make. There is so much to share in the celiac world. It’s unfair to force someone to buy a ticket to get help eating and losing weight with a food allergy. This should be a free feature.   It’s a marketing game that I don’t wish to play.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for your feedback. The vast majority of this app's users enjoy the free features and do not upgrade to premium. As much as we would love to make every feature in this app free, Fooducate is a business that needs to keep the lights on. Thank you for understanding.

----------------------------------------------------------
I deleted this app after seeing that Oreos had a grade of B. Several Fooducate members posted their excitement that Oreos "were good for you." This doesn't seem like reliable information. I was sad to see how many people said Oreos are a great healthy snack for their children. Feed your kids the occasional cookie, but don't walk around thinking that they are nutritious. In this case, Fooducate is perpetuating the idea that you can eat crap and be healthy. Fruits and vegetables are good snacks for kids, not cookies. Good luck everyone.

Title: Not helping me
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought the premium of this app because I needed some features on the pro plan for my health.  After using it for almost 5 months I have stopped using it.  The reasons are:  1. Many of the foods that I eat are not on the app.  2. Many foods have the wrong nutritional information.  3.  They have no edit feature on recipes.  When I have contacted customer service I’m told they don’t know when or if these things will be corrected as they have so many users and can’t keep up.  That makes this app poor at best but worthless for my needs.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the feedback. We will take all your comments into consideration to be able to make the app even better. We have over 300,000 products in our system and are adding daily.  We are working to quickly add all new food items to our database but we do get hundreds over a week.

Title: First day but will delete app
----------------------------------------------------------
I use and love CarbManager but was really interested in the food grades available here.  Disappointed at how many items I researched that weren’t graded.  Also, for example, I entered Premier Chocolate Protein Powder and had to hunt through the prepared drink (I said POWDER!), protein bars, etc. to find the product I specifically listed.  Need a “how to” section?  From the comments, it’s clear this app isn’t very intuitive.  And I can have 1,600k per day?  Dozens of other reputable sources cap me at 1,240 - that’s a huge difference!

After reading the description I finally found out why it wasn't working for my phone. The app itself does state that it works with IPhone 3G, but the app store states it does NOT. Kind of a bummer considering I don't want to manually input a 16 digit long number for info... This should be something that they make a littttttttle clearer. Good info overall just a major inconvenience for those of us who can't upgrade to the iPhone 8G or whatever it's at now. Maybe next year people will start dating them too.

I have scanned a few items and it always just goes back to the scanning screen after a search. So I guess that means it didn't find the product.

Don't know what I am doing wrong.  1 star until I can figure this out. 1 star for me if it is operator error but I don't know what I could possibly be doing.

----------------------------------------------------------
I haven't upgraded from the Fooducate app/name because I don't care about losing weight - I care about a quick way to compare options at the grocery store. Yet I still get a notification to "Please log your meals. Even a few is fine." ...EVEN A FEW IS FINE?! Uninstall. You've got to be kidding me. A meal logger is a great option for those doing so to lose weight (or track food's effect on a health problem), but that notification out of the blue is just encouraging disordered eating. F you.

To be fair, I really like this app’s interface. However, this is enough to make me stop using it: I don’t mind entering foods to ensure the information is correct, BUT if I make a mistake, I can’t go back in and edit My Foods. The app will let me re-enter the foods, but THEN there are duplicate foods in my list, AND I can’t even view the entry to tell them apart and know which one to use.

This app used to be great but now it's really bad (were they bought by someone else?). Much slower than it was. Several foods and especially supplements were removed.

I'm so annoyed because I really loved this app but now since I can't see my day I will use something different. All I want is a simple log, if I could fix it to where I had my calories on the top like before and able to see my log I'll use it again

----------------------------------------------------------
Registration is now required. I didn't accept the absolutely outrageous terms of service so I don't know exactly what personal info was required.  I could not agree to give the seller all rights, title, and interest and waive any other remaining rights to my info. While I can understand the need for a  business to protect itself, this piece of software doesn't seem to warrant the extent that is demanded. Read it for yourself.

Title: Family share doesn’t work
----------------------------------------------------------
Family share does not work with the paid subscription.  Your family can download the app but the paid lifetime subscription doesn’t transfer to your family members.  Such a bummer that we spent $93, the family organizer that purchased the lifetime subscription has access to all the Pro benefits but no one else.  Even when we try to restore purchases it wants me to purchase a new plan.  So sad about the misrepresentation.

Hi there, thank you for your feedback. We are sorry for the inconvenience; family sharing is not a feature of the app.

Title: Very expensive. And not worth it.
----------------------------------------------------------
So if you don't like this app they are not able to reimburse you. And when you select the in app purchase they charge for a full year, not month by month. So I just paid 24$ for an app that I am deleting because it's too confusing and too difficult to use. And the recipes are just full of fattening gross food. What kind of food educating are you doing with recipes chalk full of butter and cheese ... soooo disappointed.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, and thanks for your constructive feedback. The payment and reimbursement is done by iTunes, not Fooducate. Regarding the type of subscription, the app clearly offers a choice of monthly or annual subscriptions, there is no room for confusion. Lastly, the recipes are uploaded by users, and are not part of the food education. Please email support@fooducate.com and we will gladly answer any questions about how to use the app. In health!

I have written several times over two or three years about this issue. The only response I get is ‘this feature is not available at this time.’ I don’t understand why users can’t edit or delete recipes they input, but as someone that wants to make adjustments, it doesn’t make sense to continue paying for this app. I also think that some of the searches and interfaces need to be streamlined and made more simple.

You can’t even start without them making you 1. Write a review and 2. Go premium. I jumps the hoops only to find I couldn’t even put in today’s foods. The app clearly says it has a free option and a premium paid option. There are zero free options and as you’re trying to navigate it, it interrupts you to make you rate them. If I can’t even take 30 seconds to navigate a new app then that app goes into the trash

Deleted this app since it is misleading to "warn" about GMOs.  Why don't you warn about all the foods created by chemical mutations and that are not assessed for safety?  Oh--that would be most of the organic stuff.  Foods are only labeled by FDA when there is a health reason to do so.  FDA does not require labeling of food with GM ingredients since they are safe.  Why do you think you are more knowledgeable?

I don't think the app works very well and it's a pain in the butt to cancel your subscription. If you want to try this app out, don't do it because they do NOT make it easy to cancel. Then you're stuck being charged $2.99 a month for an app you're not using. Even if you delete the app they'll keep charging you. $2.99 isn't a lot of money but residually it adds up and it's a waste.

The nutrition database is not searchable. You can either scan a barcode (almost always processed foods) or browse. Who has time to scroll through thousands of foods to find what you're looking for?

Furthermore, there are thousands of free nutrition articles and an extremely supportive community for advice and motivation. There are several premium features that help us keep the lights on.

Just when we thought it was as bad as it could get, they made it worse. First, they removed GMO info and placed it in a separate app that was $4.99! That was short-lived.

Title: Update iOS 5.1
----------------------------------------------------------
Ever since I updated my software to 5.1 this app doesn't work, it refuses to get passes the scanner without displaying the "check connections with cellular or wireless connections then try again or dismiss." it's irritating and trying to report the bug through support came up with a blank page.

Title: Logged me out and can't get back in
----------------------------------------------------------
This app logged me out. I cannot get back in. I've tried resetting my password and then logging in but I hit log in and it won't do anything. Just sits on that screen. If I try to create a new account it won't let me because my email is already being using. Was a good app until this happened.

Title: Confusing
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is difficult and confusing. I have edited my profile multiple times and it keeps changing what I entered. The only foods that work well are if they have a barcode. So if you are making food from scratch it is cumbersome. Appears to be designed for those who eat all processed foods.

----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for your feedback. Most people find the app simple and fun to use. We'll be happy to help you, just email support@fooducate.com. Asides from products with barcodes, we have a large dataset of homemade foods, pantry basics, and restaurant dishes.

Title: Don't upgrade to premium
----------------------------------------------------------
I upgraded to premium and didn't get what I was expecting so I've been trying to cancel. It automatically renews every month but no one will respond to my emails and there is no option in the app to cancel. I'm going to have to have my bank stop payment on them. No customer service at all.

Title: Not so hot
----------------------------------------------------------
My scanner works but it can't find anything I scan!! Also you can't enter most UPC codes because they are to long! Very frustrating it's a good concept but execution is lacking. This app can't even find cherrios! What good will it do if I can't find any food to know a better alternative...

The concept sounds wonderful, but I can't get into the app after having signed up and making a password.  It keeps giving me the option of signing up but not to log in to use the app.  Frustrating.  Probably user error, but until I can find a sign in or log in place, I'll delete this app.

Hi there, and thanks for the feedback. Make sure to LOG IN, not SIGN UP. If you need further assistance, please email support@fooducate.com

Title: Good idea.. But for iPad...?
----------------------------------------------------------
I am reviewing this app for iPad. If you are like most iPad users and you only have wifi, this app is next to useless. You can only scan items if you are on wifi that second. There is no option to scan it first and look it up later (not hard to integrate) and there is no native iPad app.

Title: It was subscription based!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded then deleted the app in a matter of days. I only now realized they have been charging me a monthly subscription fee for months that I wasn't aware of. It wasn't clear when I bought the feature that it was a subscription. Sheesh the things people will do for money these days

Title: Wasting time
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is terrible and simply a food advertising tool. You have to give email and personal data to find out you have to pay for what they claim the app to be. Wasted my time. I was looking for a food carb counter, not a breakdown of what I can read on a bag of pepperidge farm cookies.

Title: Does not work
----------------------------------------------------------
Looks like a good app. Can not log in so I don't know it it does what it says it does. Sets up account but, when you enter e-mail address, won't let you select or use your password--just kicks you out of the app completely.  Have to start all over each time without getting in one time.

Title: Premium is a ripoff!
----------------------------------------------------------
Inaccurate and time consuming. The free version of My Fitness Pal is a thousand times better. This is cumbersome, doesn't sync with Fitbit other than via another app, requires you to upgrade to premium to get basic nutritional info, and doesn't provide weekly or monthly info. Useless!

Title: Hate sign ups!
----------------------------------------------------------
Used to love and use the app regularly but now it requires you to sign up!  Why?? Hate the idea so I searched and found the GoodGuide and will use that now and delete Fooducate! I even updated many foods for them but obviously they don't appreciate those of us that refused to sign up.

Title: Subscription!  $30.00+ per year!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I did not realize it would cost annually plus have in app purchases.   Never used it and had to pay an additional year because I didn’t cancel it.  Just make sure you know what you are purchasing.  I remember installing it but do not remember ever agreeing to pay over 30 bucks a year!

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
The app is free. The vast majority of the app's users never need to and don't upgrade.

Title: Misinformation
----------------------------------------------------------
Seemed like a good app, until I saw that they gave extremely unhealthy foods A ratings. Processed meats are loaded with cholesterol and have been proven to cause cancer by the World Health Organization. I don't believe this app isn't funded in someway by big agribusiness or the USDA.

Title: Horrible, condescending and dangerous
----------------------------------------------------------
I was blocked permanently from commenting because I posted links to scientific articles debunking some of the app's woo claims. They are chemo-phobic, don't understand GM technology, encourage eating disorders and allow bullying. Can't emphasize enough how messed up the admins are.

Title: Don’t use your real email address
----------------------------------------------------------
Have not had a chance to use the app much yet, BUT, the day after I signed up for it, I started get a lot of spam emails. So, regardless of whether the app is good or not, going to delete it as it is certain that they will be selling any of my data they capture. Thanks Fooducate!

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, thank for your feedback. We feel your pain. We hate spam, of any kind.  In over 10 years on the appstores, we have never, NOT ONCE, shared user information with any third party. We’re very sorry you’ve had such a bad experience with spammers, but this has nothing to do with Fooducate.

Title: I agree with "Very Suspect"
----------------------------------------------------------
This app gives high grades for the Kellogg's "healthy" brands Kashi, Morningstar Farms, Worthington, Loma Linda, et al. We KNOW that these products are loaded with GMO ingredients. Meanwhile, Amy's soups are given very low grades for sugar content. Who owns Fooducate...Monsanto?

Title: Crashed!
----------------------------------------------------------
Spent a half hour typing out a recipe with the directions and all. Then when I hit next after that it crashed. Went back in hoping it was there, but no!! I pay $7.99 per month for this? In other apps, it would’ve saved what I had put in on the recipe so far? Super frustrated!!

So sorry for your bad experience. Would you be so kind as to email us at support@fooducate.com so we can look into the matter and fix the possible bug you uncovered?

Title: This is a really stupid app
----------------------------------------------------------
I can't tell what the target audience is: if it's for people losing weight, why is everyone buying super sugary foods?it can't be for anything else because all other uses are on a premium subscription. I think this is basically an app for posting photos of your shopping trip.

Title: Another great app has fallen
----------------------------------------------------------
This used to be a great app but the latest update now requires you to create an account or login with Facebook. Plus it takes them forever to add items to the database. Guess I'll save time and go back to the old fashioned way and read labels. Thanks for ruining a great app!

Title: Dislike the new version
----------------------------------------------------------
I miss the app before this latest upgrade. I don't want to click on the app just to see my "diet partner" you've assigned to me - especially one who just posts about WATER. Please take that feature away or let us choose our own. Not even sure this app is worth keeping now.
