Title: Fatphobic as it gets!
----------------------------------------------------------
When starting out with this app, it’ll prompt you your goals (weight gain or loss & how much you’d like to gain or lose) & physical attributes (height, current weight, activity levels, etc.). Being extremely underweight like I am, I was excited to see a health app offer weight gain as an option. However, EVERYTHING on the app stays set to weight loss despite what you put in as your goal. It’ll send you notifications like “You only need 400 calories to power yourself through!” as if you’re trying to barely survive. The actual calorie counter has a daily meter for how much you’ve consumed of your daily goal. It fills up green, then when it’s full it turns red. Consuming enough or extra calories is a GOOD thing when you’re trying to gain weight, but this meter depicts the opposite. It even goes as far as to mess with your public profile & state that you’re there for weight loss despite the goal weight clearly being a higher number than the starting weight. I don’t see the purpose of offering “weight gain” as an option when the entire app’s layout is permanently fixed on a weight loss routine. It’s extremely discouraging & fatphobic.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Appreciate the feedback and yes we do need to do a better job with folks like you looking to gain, our apologies.  We do allow members to set virtually any goal for calories and other nutrients. We hope that in time we can better meet your needs and welcome any more feedback at contact@fatsecret.com

Title: Can’t get past the name 🤦‍♀️
----------------------------------------------------------
It’s a pretty good app in all, I would like an option not to add ALL nutritional info, just calories (as seen on my fitness pal) because it provides a faster and easier option for many users, but the biggest block for me is that name... I previously used my fitness pal and had no problems keeping it on my home screen for everyone to see and I needed it there because I used it often and wanted quick and easy access to it, but having an app with “fat” in the name on my home screen is embarrassing in all honesty. It was my biggest issue when I was looking into the app and I don’t know if I’ll keep it at this point. I wish the developers would see common sense and rename the app to a more positive, normal name that focuses on more than just fat. I mean, think about what that does to the user. Each time they open the app they feel like they’re reaching toward a goal, but never reaching it. In other words, it makes me feel like I’m fat when I know I’m not. It discourages me and is off-putting, but more than anything it’s just frustrating that someone would make such a great app and name it something so humiliating.

Title: Can't use if you are too fat (and I don't know what they consider "too fat")
----------------------------------------------------------
I was able to set up an account and add foods and track everything. First weigh-in comes along and I enter my new weight, which happens to be lower than my starting weight. A message pops up that tells me I am 'very heavy' and need to consult a doctor before beginning any diet. Thanks, but I already know I'm fat. That's why I'm on a diet! And my doctor fully supports my diet, for the record. I can hit 'save' but it just brings up the message again and won't save my new weight. Even though it saved my starting weight - which was higher!! Apparently this is for the people who need to lose 20 pounds but not for the people with more to lose. Very disappointed. I'm uninstalling this app and finding one that's a little more open to helping overweight people lose weight.

Title: Unfortunately macros are not accurate
----------------------------------------------------------
Unlike MyFitnessPal, there is no “verified checkmark” for simple vegetable macros. Every single vegetable has been way off and inaccurate in terms of fats and carbs. This makes me have to enter my OWN entry for veggies, which is a process in itself. I liked the app at first for its easy “saving” when selecting multiple food items. The barcode scanner is also helpful. But this app needs a more accurate and trusted library. This also needs a “quick add” macro option rather than having to add an entire new food choice. Sadly have to go back to MyFitnessPal because of this feature. Can’t spend all my time entering all my own custom values for vegetables.

Title: NO"NET"Carbs in pie graph
----------------------------------------------------------
For us folks on a VERY LOW CARB restricted or KETO diet.... we must keep our NET carbs 25-30g or below per day. We can run a bit above that so long as our NET carbs stays within this range. Although you have a section that will compute and SUBTRACT (-) the FIBER and(+) SUGAR ALCOHOLS from the TOTAL carbs.....this doesn't carry over to the pie charts and reports for the NET CARBS. Please allow the same algorithm or formula to carry over to the charts and reports. With these types of highly POPULAR diets every carb and fraction thereof is crucial. Especially with the KETO diet. We usually try to keep our CARB MACROS around the 5% mark.

Title: Wow! Truly awful
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded the app and tried to calculate my suggested amount of daily calories and the app said that my weight is too low to suggest an RDI! How is that even a reason? I’ve had my rdi calculated by tons of other apps so obviously it’s possible. It made me feel so awful I immediately deleted the app and won’t be using it. I’ve struggled with my weight my whole life and I’m underweight right now due to health issues. I can’t imagine anyone with health issues or an eating disorder being able to use this. Honestly disgusted that the devs wrote that message in the app.

Title: NOT USER FRIENDLY!
----------------------------------------------------------
Too Complicated,  I was using "Lose It" but wanted to try another app with more features. For instance; How do I add to "Saved Meals"? I keep hitting "Save" everywhere I can, yet when I go to "Saved Meals",  it's not listed! How do I copy food from my Diary, I still can't figure that one out!  So dang frustrating! I wish I could see what the calories are based on what I've eaten before I save it. It's just not user friendly at all, thank goodness it was free! I give up, it's taken up too much of my time already... Too bad!!

Title: Frustrating!
----------------------------------------------------------
It was really frustrating trying to enter personalized recipes here. While I could enter just about anything from the details page of an ingredient into my food diary (such as a cup of mayo!) I was often limited to single serving sizes when trying to add to the recipe!  This totally defeats the purpose of my moving to this app, as I was hoping the nutritional information would be more accurate than the one I am currently using. But if I can’t get a recipe in without pulling my hair out... not an option for me. :(

Title: HATE the iPhone version!
----------------------------------------------------------
Ok, I don't ever write reviews. In fact, this is my first. Let me start with a small disclaimer...I'm a tiiiiiny bit OCD, and probably more fanatical than most in journaling my daily exercise and caloric intake. With that said, I am so unbelievably disappointed with this app. I previously had a Droid, and I LOVED Calorie Counter...used it all day, everyday. At my biannual upgrade, I (against my better judgement) switched to the iPhone 4S, and the features and functionality of this app completely changed!

Title: Doesn’t sync between devices
----------------------------------------------------------
v8.2.9 is not syncing across devices very well if at all. This weekend as I was out and about using my iPhone X I would add foods to my diary, but when getting home & switching to my iPad the foods I added during the day were not there. Very poor experience. This needs to be updated ASAP. 1 star until fixed. Maybe while you’re at it you could add a refresh button or “pull to refresh” so I don’t have to force close the app to get it to hit the server to sync foods added from another device. Thanks

I can not even get past the sign in when I put in skip it took me to the food which I also could not put anything in. This is the most frustrating useless piece of junk ever! I have your old ap which worked perfectly until you jerks took away where I could put in the actual amount of food I was going to eat. I use grams, I am diabetic and I need a carb count to figure out my insulin. I am beyond angry at you people! Hopefully I can find an ap that does work because yours is crap!

New update works but it's more difficult to use. Under restaurants there's no more categories like dessert or steak or chicken etc. Under column it doesn't allow you to change rdi and calories. The old version was a lot easier to use because you could simply swipe left or right to go back a day or forward a day now you have to use some wheel to pick dates and the date on the wheel is off too...so much hope for this but was completely let down

----------------------------------------------------------
I have used this app for I think a decade or so. I have Type 1 Diabetes and have been insulin dependent since I was a little girl... for 37 years. This app WAS great because I could look up carbohydrates in meals from restaurants and I knew exactly how much insulin I needed to take for a meal. I don’t know why the restaurant information is not available anymore but I guess I will delete this app and find a new one....

Title: Frustrating
----------------------------------------------------------
Downloaded FatSecret to track my daily entries on my Ketogenic diet.  I've spent 45 minutes trying to set my goals and recalculate my calorie limit. I get everything entered, hit save, and the recalc stays at 1700 calories daily. Surely, this cannot be accurate. I use 70% fat, 25% protein and 5% carbs. After each save, it reverts to 5% fat, 70% carbs. Giving up and deleting the app. I'll stick with KetoDiet app.

The FatSecret community is mostly encouraging and supportive. There is no way to block those who body shame, bully or use the FS community as another social media app. Overall a great app but experience is ruined by a few who targets those who have successfully lost who maintained their weight. They’ve changed it in an upgrade. Took away some features like preplanning to introduce a paid version.

----------------------------------------------------------
The app has a lot of good food data to select from but there are some problems with it. When I change the quantity of the food selected the app just closes itself. It times out a lot in the middle of searches and the barcode scanner doesn't work very well. Also, it has not been adding the calories up properly. When I open each food item the calories listed are correct but the total is incorrect.

----------------------------------------------------------
I have used both my fitness pal & this.  This app is not user friendly, & when you find a food item that is not in the data base, or say you make actual meals from scratch, it is required that you first decode the matrix before you're allowed to put your own recipes in.   Myfitt is not perfect, but it is easier to use, the data base is huge, & putting up with the ads is worth it.

This used to be my go to app for everything I ate but the recent changes just make this a miserable app to use now.

Guess its time to move on to a better, more comprehensive app.

If you cook anything more complicated than a boiled egg, this is not the app for you. There is no way to create a recipe and then divide it into portions. You can create a meal, but each element of the meal gets listed in your diary, and the total can't be portioned. The bar code scanner isn't great, either. This app needs a lot more work.

----------------------------------------------------------
I use I love this app, there is so much less info than before.  I can't track my carbs or fats or proteins.   I'm going to find a different app.  Sorry, the updates made it seem like they were just starting their app.  Not impressed at all.

----------------------------------------------------------
This last update makes it so I can’t open the app anymore!  It’s just stays on the green screen with the logo for a minute and then shuts down.  I’ve been using this for YEARS and all my recipes are in there so I really need it to work!

----------------------------------------------------------
The portions are mostly based on visual assessment like bread by slice. Or “small slice”. I couldn’t find option to select for certain amount of grams. If you are serious and not casually trying to assess calories you can’t use the app

Title: Won't let me enter exercise
----------------------------------------------------------
Although I have entered my weight about 10 times, it keeps prompting me to enter my weight before it can calculate my energy expenditure from exercise.  All the food data in the world isn't helpful if I can't calculate my calories OUT.

Was great until the latest "bug fix". Now ads appear at the bottom and interfere with the functionality of the app. I keep hitting the damned ads by mistake which I guess is part of the design now. I see a downward trend with this app.

It’s not intuitive. No live support or FAQs. Can’t set macros. Limited nutrition tracking even with premier plan. Very difficult to add a food. And can’t add a recipe. You can’t just add something and list net carbs. Too much work.
