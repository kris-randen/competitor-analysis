Title: Use it and lose it
----------------------------------------------------------
Cataloging everything that passes your lips can be very tedious and all the times I tried writing it down I never seemed to be where my log was.  With this app and our age of technology, I'm never far from my phone.   I love that it interfaces with Fitbit and other apps.  Yes the food library is a bit limited but the app provides ways to help them help us.  It also allows you to put in your favorite recipe and account for things you'll never find in another place on the planet.   It conveniently lets you scan the upc and in most cases, the dietary data is provided.  When it doesn't, it's easy as pie to take a pic within the app of the front of pkg and of the nutritional data and they update the system as we collectively provide data.   You can keep track of anything you want in this app and it's especially helpful to see trends.   It's always a good thing to raise one's awareness and through the use of this app I've been able to significantly lower my A1C, lose 20 pounds over the last year and increase my awareness of what I'm doing to and for my body and health.  The spreadsheet is miraculous to review with your doctor and see trends that support your health.  My doctor commented, while I showed her the graph on her screen at the Ofc that she wished all her patients were willing to use technology to help themselves.  It inspires me to see the guy descend the slope each time I'm able to show another pound gone.   Yay for this app!

Title: Assign label
----------------------------------------------------------
Great app,but please fix the issues with the assign label where it keeps deleting what I write or add.Also if you can fix the issue with the symbols,such as arrows that after a few hours they disappear , and reappear with question marks, basically I use the free style libre which I wear a censor that I scan with a transmitter that tells me my glucose numbers through out the day,which eliminates the use of pricking my fingers,nevertheless the feature which I like is that when my numbers appear after the scan,such as let’s say 120 well it would show you 120➡️ like so with the arrow pointing straight,which means my glucose is changing slowly,there are these arrows ↙️↖️⬆️⬇️ and they mean such as ⬇️ quickly fallen,etc....,etc it helps a lot for me when I log them for the bg readings on this app and easy to see where the arrows are pointing and gives me a better understanding to correspond too what food I ate & why my numbers are high or low & then I can make my adjustments.i notice that arrow symbols or other symbols were working fine about a week or so but after a couple updates,the symbols disappear within a few hours and are replaced with two question marks,?? Hopefully you can resolve this issue,it would be very appreciated ,and again the best app ever,that helps my diebethis effortlessly,which I highly recommend ,thanks again.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Sorry for the troubles, we have fixed this issue in app update v6.35, already available on the App Store. Please try the new update, if something is not right please send us a support request from the app, we would be glad to help.

Title: Love MyNetDiary
----------------------------------------------------------
I am a Type 2 diabetic since 2007. I have never had good control of my diabetes. I went for a check up in early March and my doctor wanted to significantly increase my insulin intake. That was on a Friday. I sulked all weekend about the medication increase. My doctor also wanted me to log my blood sugars for the next few weeks so we could get a better idea of when my high sugar readings were.  I tried writing them in a log book but would forget to write them down or not have my book with me when not at home. I decided to search the apps on my phone and find one that I could use. MyNetDiary is the first one that came up and it was so easy to use. It has helped me keep 80% of my sugars in the green for the last 6 weeks and helped me keep up with my calorie and carb intake. I love how it logs my steps and helps me keep up with my exercise and how many calories I burn in a day.  My daughter started using it to help her lose her baby weight and has lost 15 lbs in 5 weeks and looks great and feels great! I highly recommend MyNetDiary for both diabetics and non-diabetics.

Title: Love the recipe option
----------------------------------------------------------
This app allows you to store recipes with a total number of servings (or grams). For example, you can save a muffin recipe that makes 12 muffins by entering all the ingredients. Then, when you eat just 1 muffin, it does the math for you to figure out how many carbs you ate based on the total recipe. You can also save you favorite dine-out food as recipes, such as to-go salads --just enter all the ingredients. You can even take a picture of your recipe and save that (though not sure how useful that is). You can copy meals from one day to the next. It has many different ways to enter food (grams, cups, oz, number of (almonds, for example)). It is very useful and has made gestational diabetes not overwhleming. Blood glucose very easy to track.  It took a day to figure out how to use all of the features. They only thing I have not figured out how to do is enter carb goals for all meals, but I am sure I will soon. Very much worth the $9.99.

Title: Lost 40 lbs in 5 months !
----------------------------------------------------------
This app started my weight loss when I first used its barcode feature to "grade" items I intended to purchase in the grocery store . I initially established a plan to by only products the app gives a A- to , or higher . Sticking to this plan, and entering in the food items I ate each day (with the suggested calorie per day for my goal),  saw some very encouraging weight loss within only a few days .  The initial weight loss then encouraged me to begin to exercise,  and after 5 months I have lost 40 pounds . Within the past few weeks the rate of weight loss has slowed , but it is still going down. The app tells me how many ounces I should lose each day based on the amount of exercise I enter in each day and the food items I track . That part does not seem very accurate since currently it predicts I will lose a pound per day but in reality I am now losing about  a pound per week. It has been the best app of all those on my phone .

Title: Excellent!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m a diabetic and track my blood sugars. I have tried several programs and had to input notes. With MyNetDiary it tracks blood sugars for you.  Charts for a quick reference of where you have been and how your doing. I especially like how you can check the rating of food, the breakdown of nutrients, fat content etc. It will show you the overall nutrients for the day. What your overages are ie fat, cholesterol, sodium and also where you have come up short ie potassium, vitamins etc. it will give you guidelines and information how to lower calories to help you attain your goal if losing or maintaining weight. I lost 50 pounds the last year, with a personal trainer, a nutritionist and MyNetDiary. My A1C went from 6.7 to 6.1. I came off of several medications that I have been on for years. Yes I still struggle with eating correctly but with MyNetDiary it keeps me accountable to myself.

Title: Love my net diary
----------------------------------------------------------
Love my net diary - I have tried out a number of calorie counters and found it to be the best. Best range of foods, easiest to enter and can either enter on my iPhone or on the web site at work. Can add common recipes or combinations of foods that I regularly have. Also like that most foods can measure in grams as means it is much more accurate than trying to measure or estimate volumes. I have a good food weigher at home and a simple small weighing device I take in my purse for when on the go. I freeze 100cal veggie sides like creamed spinach in the freezer so they go with my protein meals.  Read awhile ago that they were doing a diabetics app and while I don't have diabetes, I do have PCOS and insulin resistance and I'm trying to eat low GI. This allows me to measure the effects of different foods and motivate me to keep my blood sugar low while I try to give up chocolate.

Title: Perfect tool for the newly diagnosed!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes 9 days ago, and like may other newbies, my head was spinning with how many things I now need to keep track of to document my progress. I read the reviews and downloaded this App. It makes order out of chaos. Getting started is very easy: enter height, weight, age, diabetes 1 or 2. It gives recommended daily calorie intake and all other components such as Carbs, sugar, protien... It tracks all information that is available to it, making it an all in one data storage spot. For me: managing my diet would have been impossible without it. It has an extensive food item data base, so when you select an item, all the dietary information comes up and is stored for that meal. For folks like me that never counted anything besides helpings before, this App has been infinitely helpful, to get me started on the right track.

Title: Love Love This App!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was already keeping a very detailed written logbook for months before finding MND.  I wish I had heard/found it sooner though as it would have made my life way easier, even though the habit of writing things out was good.  Helped me to get my A1C down from a 9 to a 5.2 and lose over 120lbs from ~290 to 167.   By just changing my diet and later adding some light exercise, I was able to get off insulin completely.  Keeping track of my glucose and meals is still such a daily routine that I continue to use this app every day and I love how it integrates with my Withings smart scale and OneTouch Verio glucose monitor via Apple's Health app. They seam to have thought of everything when providing the tools to making quick and easy entries. You also can't beat their support team, who are were very quick and responsive to some issues I was having.  A++

Title: So much more than just a diabetes app!
----------------------------------------------------------
Wow. I've used lots of heath and fitness apps with varying degrees of usefulness and nothing compares to this app. The food diary alone is worth the cost of the whole app but add in the charts, ability to track various health items,  email your weekly synopsis to yourself or your doctor, keep track of exercise, nutrients, steps. The daily analysis is one if my fav things. I love how it keeps you abreast of your progress toward your weight loss goal  and the little thumbs ups and downs are good motivators of things you don't usually think about in your diet.  It's totally helped me to stay on track. I check my food diary information before I eat something and definitely alter what I eat based on the info the app provides.   I like the idea of the food score. I haven't ever utilized that but an planning on reading up on it some more.

Title: Saving my life!
----------------------------------------------------------
Before this app my numbers were all over the place! My lowest reading was 240.  This app has helped me to understand what foods make my sugar spike and what foods keep me within the normal range. I've had this app for a month and I've already lost 9 lbs just by logging what I eat and making adjustments. The only complaint I have is that the food "database" is limited, but the bar code reader makes up for that. At my two week check up my doctor was so impressed with the chart that he went and got his phone and bought the app on the spot. The nutritionist they sent me to did the same thing. I have found this app extremely helpful. I've read books and know what I should and should not eat, but knowing never helped. Seeing the results plotted out on the chart and seeing how each food impacted my numbers has been a game changer for me.

Title: Love this app! Worth every penny!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app tracks everything! You don’t need any other app! One stop health app!!!!! I am a type 2 diabetic and I follow ketogenic diet. The app tracks my medications, My supplements, my blood sugar, my blood pressure, my oxygen, my steps,  my water intake,As well as giving me an amazing macros pie chart to look at. It lets me set my daily goals by carbs rather than calorie while letting me still watch my calories. I just love this thing! You have continued to make it better and better as I’ve used it and I am so excited to tell everybody to sign up here! I have told my whole family that they should have this app. So helpful for when you have medication and a forgetful mind to be able to track your medication & know exactly what time you took it! Wow,  you guys just keep getting better and better!!!

Title: Almost perfect!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is, in my opinion, the absolute best food/fitness tracking app if you are also a diabetic needing to track carb intake and BG readings. Many other trackers are available in MND as well, with the option to create some custom ones. I wanted an app with the ability to track BG readings and carb intake (for sliding scale purposes). However, I'm also trying to be more active and eat healthier, hoping to lose about ten pounds. Many of the better health/fitness apps do not have a way to record diabetic related readings, meaning you have to have several different apps and logs going at once, never quite getting a view of the big picture. With this app, you can see everything without having to duplicate your logs in multiple apps. I have absolutely loved this app for the few weeks I've had it.

Title: I've Been Waiting Years For This App!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Have been using 3 apps for years to track nutrition, diabetes & meds. Yippee!  One app to do it all. App takes into account all aspects of DM management. Was very impressed with d-carb count which make a significant difference in managing diet & meds. Daily summery of blood sugars, insulin & other meds, nutrients, H2o, activity, ability to set parameters for nutrients & blood sugars specific to the needs of the individual is much appreciated. Food database still on the small side but will enlarge as people use it I'm sure. I stumbled on this app by accident & consider it a very happy accident. Can't wait to show it to my DM & dietary educators. As a retired RN & having worked with many diabetics as well as now being diabetic myself  I can really appreciate this app. Good job guys!!!

Title: Taking control made easy
----------------------------------------------------------
I was diagnosed very early at age 24. Always have battled with weight and diabetes management. Feeling really blessed that technology has finally caught up for tracking not only blood sugar readings but also the factors affecting them - diet and exercise!!!  I loathe keeping food journals 😡 and always have. This app makes it second nature and fun simply by using bar codes. Even better, if something isn't yet in the database, you improve the app by gathering all the data (took 20 seconds at the very, very most 😄😄😄) and sending it in to be added for everyone using the app!!  I can't wait to see what the next few months will bring and how impressed my diabetes care team will be with the detailed information I'll be able to provide them going forward!!!

Title: Good but reports need work
----------------------------------------------------------
Tracking is excellent. The paid version is great with xtra details for Diabetics.  However, the reports need the ability to customize. Printing is too small to read. I may be missing something, but you can’t change orientation, or get rid of the food grade column which is useless to my Doctor. The emailed report works, but the customized PDF daily can’t connect to the website and gives an error to Wait one minute and try again. They won’t process to print. This feature was working up to a few days ago. Emails to the support team have gone unanswered. Reports are the most important part of the app for me and my doctor. If this is not important to you, its a great app.  If support is given in this paid version, I will revisit my review.

Title: Lifesaver for newly diagnosed diabetic
----------------------------------------------------------
I accidentally bought the diet version which focuses on just calories, but realized my mistake and purchased the D version. I set my own carb limits and modified the nutrient settings to match my needs which I really liked. Predefined food listing is very good and I have added lots if my favorite brands using the barcode and nutrition scanner which is easy to use. If I know I will be eating out or will have limited food choices I can enter food ahead of time to balance out my nutrient needs for the day. I love feeling in control instead if the food controlling me. The charts are fun to reassure me I am on track. Feeling full of energy, blood sugar in range and lost 27lbs in 10 weeks.

Title: Great app for a newly diagnosed diabetic
----------------------------------------------------------
I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few months ago and began digging around for a good app for tracking my situation. After trying a few that were just fine (each with some fundamental flaw or shortcoming), I tried MyNetDiary. Works great, has a huge food database (I really like the barcode scanner), and it remembers values from one entry to the next (so, for example, you don't have to respecify the time on every element of a meal). There's no one feature that stands out as amazing (except, like I mentioned, maybe the barcode scanner) -- it's just a well-thought-out app with lots of features which all seem to work correctly and quickly. Good stuff!

Title: Think and thin
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app for about 2+ years and love it.  I can track all my diabetic insulin and carbs meds and exercise. I can go back days and months to see what works and what failed. I used this app for my Keto diet and lost 25# and tracked everything I ate plus added new recipes or foods. I could track my HCG and my insulin and meds. At one point I would print out my daily calories and take them to my dietitian to prove what I was eating and how to manage my insulin. I only had to pay extra for the print out but I paid only for the month I used it.  I can’t say enough good things about this app it has been with me for thick and thin. Lol you

Title: What a way to keep up on macros
----------------------------------------------------------
Excited I got this app. It tracks your breakfast, lunch and dinner. Input what you've eaten based as oz, grams, etc.. It has the option to barcode items which makes things a lot easier for me. I approve on the grading scale, so when you barcode capture, it'll grade your items. You can track your BG number and amount of insulin; it'll chart out so you'll see a trend in your BG numbers. It records your water intake, which I'm pretty into. Get this app, I approve. The only thing I dislike is that your Fitbit does not connect. You'd have to upgrade to premium for that and I just don't want to do that.  Overall, amazing app for track and record.

Title: Well Done
----------------------------------------------------------
Literally I never write reviews. This app is extremely compelling, so here I am. I have been using this app religiously for 5 months and I have lost 30lbs. My need for Metformin has dropped under Dr. supervision from 500mg twice daily to once daily while maintaining a 5.8 A1C. My Doctor has high hopes that he can completely eliminate the Metformin.  For the record I have zero self control so I find it amazing that just keeping a log of my lifestyle (calories & exercise) has facilitated this change. My only complaint is the app congratulates you for 3 days of record keeping. This gets a little old when you have been doing it for 5 months.

I either researched or used the key food/exercise trackers.  MyNetDiary Pro and Diabetes versions are the best!  They bring in all major needs, exercise, foods, calorie and nutrient plus macros determination. Along with great extras like measurements and the diabetes version (which I prefer even though I don't have diabetes) adds medication tracking and more granular nutrients and allows you to create trackers for whatever you want (I use it to track meditation, journaling, etc.).  I don't have an add on subscription, but believe if I wanted one it would be well done.  Thank you MyNetDiary for excellent products!

Title: Greatest App Ever!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am so grateful that I found this app. My diabetes was getting out of control and had to make some changes fast. This app made it so easy for me to focus on what I ate and not on figuring out calories and ratios. It is easy to use. This particular app also helped me monitor my fasting glucose levels. In 3 months, my A1C was back to 5.3 and I had lost over 40 pounds. 3 years later it is still off and A1C is down to 5.0. Sometimes, I used their massive records of foods and at other times, I created my own. With their built in scanner, it is easy to scan a barcode and they will enter it for you. Kudos to you!

Title: The best app for managing the keto lifestyle!
----------------------------------------------------------
I tried 5 other top rated apps, this is by far the best one. With this app I can track my blood glucose, carbs, net carbs, protein, fat and a ton of vitamins and minerals; not to mention height, weight, body mass index, personal macro targets, water exercise, steps, meals, recipes, and custom and database listed foods. I especially like how you can use the bar scan feature to scan foods in the supermarket or at home to add to favorites and recipes. This app works great on my phone and my iPad. I rarely ever purchase annual fee based apps, but this one is Easy to use and well worth the annual fee.

I was diagnosed with diabetes two years ago and have been struggling to keep my sugars under control. I downloaded MyNetDiary a few months ago to track foods I eat. With that, I've lost on average 1 pound a week. I downloaded MyNetDiary Pro and loved it even more. now, with the new diabetes version, tracking my sugar is easy and I finally have my numbers under control. It is so simple and is actually motivating. I encourage anyone who wants to lose weight to download the Pro version, and diabetics to download the D version. I just wish I could sync all my devices without having to pay a premium.

I love that it takes no time at all to put in all the information, and I love that it counts carbs for you!! I also love that I can easily send this information to my doctor quickly through email!!

I have used this app for a few months now and I really like it. I don't have diabetes but I have many relatives who do, so I check my blood sugar regularly just to keep an eye on things. I was trying to keep track of everything in a spreadsheet but this app makes it so much simpler. It's very easy to use. Entering glucose numbers and food is super simple. I like being able to create recipes for things I eat regularly. I've never paid more than a couple of dollars for an app before, but I would say this app was definitely worth the money. I also like that it links to the Fitbit app.

----------------------------------------------------------
Being diabetic, I keep track of my glucose readings daily. This app does that for me and makes it easy to see how I'm doing in the chart area. I enter all food and medicine, vitamins daily, and track all exercise. There is a chart for all so you can see your progress. It also shows a fat, carb, and protein sliding bar showing how much of each your body gets, and then the overage. It's great to watch my carb count. At the end of the week, you can print a complete report of all the food you eat and exercise. It's easy to enter everything you want to track. I really love this app.

I had previously used the Weight Watchers app ..  After recently being diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.. I started searching for a better comprehensive way to track my overall health ... Diet, food, weight, measurements, BG levels, exercise, vitamins, water intake and even a place to add notes  ...   Much better bang for your buck.   Whether you are a diabetic, pre diabetic .. You customize this according to your own body and goals ... Mr Dr. Loved it when I showed it to her  Or just want a great path to better help ... This app is perfect ! Wish I had seen it sooner 💜

Title: Excellent App, Well worth the money
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm new to Net Diary, and I already find it indispensable. I often have low blood sugar, secondary to gastric bypass, and have been struggling to find the right balance between protein, fat, and carbs. The simple act of writing down all that I ate has been a tremendous help in figuring that out. The reason it is well worth the money is the included features that other free apps don't have or make as intuitive - a Blood Glucose timer, timing your meals and snacks, and a calorie/nutrient display that is very helpful. This was clearly a well thought-out app. Thank you!

He has recommended this app to his other patients.  Thank you for a great app!!!!

----------------------------------------------------------
I literally just got out of hospital because I was feeling HORRIBLE for a long time.  Unmanaged Diabetes.  It can KILL you.  It was killing me.  I already have health problems, but my blood had become too acidic, etc.  Dont be a fool, you have to manage your blood sugar levels track your foods etc.  I was following a high protein, low carb diet, but wasn’t consistent and I literally was destroying my body.  DIABETICS DONT EAT LOW FAT and HIGH PROTEIN!  Check out how to eat...it’s not what you think and this app keeps you on track!  They thought of everything!

Title: EXCELLENT
----------------------------------------------------------
I don't rate very many apps. But I thought that this one deserved it. I have been a diabetic for over 20 years, and have struggled with keeping track of my weight and my medications, etc. that entire time.  With this app, I can keep everything in one place; might weight, my blood sugars, my insulin doses and everything else. I'm always discovering something new. After my last visit with the doctor, I discovered I can keep track of my blood work (A1C and such), which I have now started to do.  I can't wait to see what they'll come up with in the next version.

Title: Great app
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a great app that helps keep one accountable. My best advice is start slow with using it. You don't need to use all the bells and whistles at once. I started just logging food and glucose testing.  Now I use reminders after meals, sync it to my step tracker, track my blood pressure and weight. The only thing I would like to see improved is a way to change the sound it makes to notify you to test. I never hear it when my phone is in my pocket or not in the same room I am. Minor, but would be nice. Thank you for making something easy to use and helpful!

Title: Medications?
----------------------------------------------------------
Overall this is a fantastic app based on about 1 hour of looking and entering information.  I went into medications and set up all 7 medications I currently take and was given an opportunity to document my use of the medications.  Now, when I choose medications, it takes me to the setup screen only and there is no place to access the medications I set up previously.  Also, the help screen for the medications setup returns a "This page cannot be found" error. I hope you can fix these two problems quickly as this is the app I have been looking for !!!!!

----------------------------------------------------------
I'm so fortunate this is one of the first apps I considered when I was diagnosed with diabetes 2.  I've told other friends about it (some with diabetes, some just looking to lose weight).  It's been a Godsend. I can track foods easily and manage calorie and carb intake through the day to assure I stay in line with my plan.  And it's great to check charts to see how I've progressed.  Like the way it syncs with Fitbit too.  This is worth every penny.  I told my wife - I don't know how I'd manage this in days before a digital product such as MyNetDiary.

Excellent app that is an invaluable tool for the management of diabetes.  My doctor is impressed with the way the app shows him charts of my blood glucose, blood pressure, pulse, and weight so he can see at a glance how I have been doing.  The food database is quite comprehensive and easy to use.  I have found that if I don't track my intake carefully, then I drift into a more permissive food intake which inescapably shows up in my charts.  Thank you for providing a way to extend my life, or at least keep me from shortening it through my behavior.

I spent a lot of time researching diabetes apps, then chose this one over a year ago and have been using it everyday since then.

It gives me good personal feedback, keeps me on track, and has helped me and my physician meet my DM treatment goals. Thank you so much for a terrific app and being committed to regular updates!

I had a bunch of apps to track weight and meals. Just used this for tracking my blood glucose. Absurd! Did a search for MyNetDiary versus other ones that are popular. Realized I was missing out by not keeping it all on this one. Deleted the other 4 and starting today just using this. It is truly a dashboard for running your body in a more fit condition. Impressed with how easy to track meals, water consumption, calories burned by exercise, all my medications, my progress on weight loss goal in addition to my daily blood glucose. A valuable app!

Title: Many features but not all work well
----------------------------------------------------------
I was hopeful this program would help me and be easy to use. To a degree it is and I suppose as I use it more some entries will get easier. But the big problem is the tedious entry of foods. Making recipes will help some but the bar code scanner is worthless as it requires these 61 year old hands to be steady (which they are not) and then, it dings and nothing happens! Incredibly poor. I previously used MyFitnessPal and I guess I'm spoiled as that program's bar code scanner works instantly in any light or orientation. Room for improvement here.

I'm type 2 and I stumbled upon this app for tracking my blood sugar. Within a week, I started using it for meals, exercise, and weight, too. Great integration with Apple Health. Not the best with the Garmin VivoActive HR, but that's likely Garmin's fault. Could use more water tracking. I would prefer to see full nutritional info on food check, but this app does well, and the food database is very extensive. Great integration with the AccuChek Aviva Connect thru Apple Health. Also works great with the Withings scale, also thru Apple Health app.

I was lucky to have found this app shortly after being diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. It has really helped me to be mindful about checking my blood sugar and tracking what I eat. I've been able to get my blood sugar under control and I've even lost some weight. The graphs are great, because you are able to see trends in blood sugar, weight, blood pressure, etc. They really encourage me to stay on track. It was well worth the $10 I paid for it. I recommend it to anyone looking for a diabetic app that allows you to track just about anything.

My Net Diary has helped me in tracking everything I eat and exercise to loose 20 pounds so far & helped me get my blood sugars down from over 200 into the 120 range. It has also helped me increased my water intake to a gallon a day. It’s been a big help. It’s important that you enter everything throughout the day so you can see that you are on track for were you want to be. My apple watch works w/ My Net Diary to track my steps & exercise. I paid for the full version. For me its worth it to accomplish my goal to a more healthier me.

This app is similar to MyNetDiary with added features such as tracking blood sugar and other medications.  It also syncs with other devices to track steps and exercise.  I also like the note-taking function.  I am using the Max version that I believe is worth the price.  Besides diabetes, I have other medical conditions and I find this helpful for everything.  Being able to log medications ensures that I don’t forget a dose or double-dose.  My doctor appreciated that I could show her my blood sugar results over a period of time.

I've used this app for many years now and it has improved a lot. The truth is that the app is comprehensive and the sharing with Health App is nice. It also is able to import some data from the Health App like bp, and place that data on a chart. I like a lot the charts it shows where you can see your progress (or lack thereof). The widget allows for quick logging of blood glucose and a daily average. Highly recommended if you want to log and keep tabs on your progress. I wished it had the option to  track ketones in the urine.

I've been using net diary and liked it so much I purchased the d version being diagnosed with diabetes recently.  I have enjoyed seeing results change with the eating habits and exercise routines.  Also helped with establishing percentages of fats to carbs to proteins.  I was able to elevate my carb intake and adjust my fats and proteins concurrently.  Was 254lbs now weighing in at 240lbs by just watching my food intake and exercising.  Best part is checking calorie intake to finding out I'm short one cup of ice cream!

I love all the ways you can export data from the app & website. The data displays are very helpful for seeing trends over time. I wish you could select particular display types though, e.g. range charts for monthly glucose levels (instead of scatter plots), but the trend lines are good. MyNetDiary is pretty quick about adding new food to their database using PhotoFood. Also, with the new version, there is better integration with the iOS Health app, so you can read/write more salient data points. Great job!!

I've also learned a lot about good nutritional value and foods to avoid. I'm so happy I'm treating myself to a trip to DisneyWorld!

----------------------------------------------------------
I really liked this app before, but the latest updates have made it even nicer to work with. I find I can't eat nearly as many carbs as it allows and still keep my blood sugar where it should be, but this can be adjusted in the settings. I wanted to combine this app data with fitbit and had to also purchase the max application; that didn't seem right to me, but maybe it was my misunderstanding. The app does allow you to track everything you need to and the reports can be tailored to most any of my needs.

----------------------------------------------------------
T2D now on insulin.  The Diabetes app is great because it tracks multiple BGs, as well as insulin, a1c, etc.  It makes setting up recipes easy.  Note that the home recipes in my fitness pal aren’t available in the database this uses, because you can’t depend on the carbs being correct.  For a T1D and some T2Ds, that’s life threatening, so you have to set up each recipe yourself.  For example, 1 cup steel cut oats, 4 cups water, then weigh so you can calculate the carbs based on weight...

My only suggestion would be an on app calculator so you can calculate your insulin to carb ratio without leaving the app.

I can't think of any other way to lose weight and become healthy at the same time.

Title: Diabetics Check This Out
----------------------------------------------------------
After trying another app which has a lot of great ratings, I found it was outdated and tedious to use. Don't be fooled, this app is far superior and much easier to use. I am using it to track my blood glucose, meals, exercise, weight, and medication. This app makes it a breeze. The nutritional information has the most entries I have found, and for the foods not in there, it's easy to add. This app is definitely the better choice.

Title: Extremely useful
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used this app for years--upgraded to the Pro version, and then recently upgraded again to the diabetic version when I was diagnosed with diabetes. I use it constantly, and find it so helpful for tracking daily nutrition, charting progress, and making meal choices (I love that it gives me a letter grade for food items I enter!) Great functionality and great features like UPC scan to capture nutrition info. Highly recommend!

Title: Thank You : MyNetDiary Pro & MyNetDiary Diabetes
----------------------------------------------------------
I began on March 26th 2012 on just MyNetDiary. I absolutely love it! I became Type II diabetic and needed to loose weight. This App has totally helped me in getting my weight into control. I have since lost 35# and now am using MyNetDiary D to record my glucose numbers and I absolutely love the charts and continue to have the incentive I need to continue in a healthy life style. Thank you, my life has changed to a healthy future!

Title: Great app - just what I needed
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is the perfect tool for me, a newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic.  It syncs with my Fitbit, helps me understand carb/protein/fat ratios and lets me know how I'm doing throughout the day. The reports at the end of the week are especially helpful in terms of knowing what to tweak. Tracking blood glucose with labels is an especially important feature for me as I learn what food combinations more adversely affect these numbers.

Title: Adjustable
----------------------------------------------------------
This app can be as complex or simple as you want. Keeps me on track and keeps me doing the right things. Have had no issues with food entries but the scanner database seems limited. For most things a word search works fine. Seems to have a lot of flexibility. Buy it, I was hesitant at first but ask yourself how much your meds cost? Isn't your health worth it? Other cheeper apps out there may work but I like this ones interface.

Title: Keto and Diabetic Awesomeness
----------------------------------------------------------
I first got this app to track keto carbs and then I also saw the blood sugar monitoring and tracking. Not only can I count carbs and calories, scan labels, track water glasses per day and weight, but I can add multiple blood sugar readings per day! It has charts and even reminders. I am really happy with this app as I was really trying to lose weight and track my macro nutrient ratio. Get and make it a part of your lifestyle!

----------------------------------------------------------
I greatly depend on this program for records of my diabetic progress. This program is well thought out, and is very versatile, without a lot of unnecessary hocus-pocus. The developers continue to refine and improve this program. They are responsive to suggestion is to enhance the effectiveness of daily use. I would unconditionally recommend this program to any one who is serious about documenting their diabetic information.

Title: Very helpful app
----------------------------------------------------------
This is the best overall diabetes monitoring app I have used. I would like to see it get easier to put in my own recipes. Because of dietary restrictions, I bake with non-commercial blends of GF flour, and cook many non prepared foods. It is a great app for tracking exercise and intake. I think some markers could be updated. Cholesterol is an arguable commodity, so I cringe at eating eggs which my Dr says are beneficial.

Title: Lost 60 lbs and losing more
----------------------------------------------------------
Lost over 60lbs logging in all of the foods i eat along with my fitbit. It also helps me to track my blood sugar level with the chart via subscription. This is a great app but even better when you get to utilize the maximum subscription. Although i was hesitant about subscribing, it was all worth it for my health. I just got diagnosed with diabetes and am trying to reverse it with a healthy diet, exercise and this app.

Title: Saving a life one bite at a time.
----------------------------------------------------------
Finally an app that is so useful and easy to use and is literally saving my life. This app along with new technology like the freestyle libre sensor has helped get my A-1 C from a 17.5 down to 6.9. I may even be able to save my feet. I do not know of very many apps where the users can actually claim the app is improving their health and possibly extending their life. If you were diabetic, this app is a must have.

Title: Top notch, best easiest food diary
----------------------------------------------------------
It’s not a struggle to log your food! It’s extremely interactive. Easy to scan your food and make changes, watch the apple and bicycle, watch videos and get helpful tips. They also send to your email a weekly update and breakdown of nutrients exercise weight loss blood glucose ( BG)  water intake. They have reminders to drink water or take BG if you would like and so much more. Worth the premium price 10 x over.

Title: Best All-Around App
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is very flexible and customizable to fit needs, especially for diabetics.  It is also good for non-diabetics, as it tracks calories, exercise and nutrition in separate breakfast, lunch and dinner modules.  The end of the day analysis is ver beneficial.  Only con is that it doesn't sync the exercise walking with your phones GPS for automatic exercise updates, but it's easy to enter manually.  Great app!

Title: Great app!  Covers all areas of diabetes management
----------------------------------------------------------
This app covers everything.  I can plan my meals and snacks for the day.  I can plan my meds, vitamins.  I can log all of my glucose readings so that when I go to the doctor, I just hand him my phone and let him scroll thru.  The only thing that could beat this is a watch that measures glucose.  I've also used Glucosuccess but it's not as thorough and depends on multiple apps whereas this is everything in one.

----------------------------------------------------------
I am a software design engineer and this program is about as good as one gets. Both the iOS and the Mac versions are fantastic. Diabetes module is well worth the extra money if you need it. This program has helped me lose over 20lbs and get my blood sugar stabile at a normal level in only two months. My doctor was blown away at the details and information available in the reports and charts. Highly rated!!!

Title: Best App I've Used
----------------------------------------------------------
I find this app extremely easy to use. Until I found it, I was using 3 different apps to do everything that is included in this one app. Tracking exercise in one app, glucose tests in another, and water consumption in a third. I am glad I paid for this app. I enjoy the ease of adding new foods not in the database. You can't go wrong for the money if you are a diabetic, an need to track these things as well.

----------------------------------------------------------
I am a mom of a newly found diabetic, and all the things that we have to keep track of this app has. Everything that we were worried about knowing for carbs this app solves it is amazing. I love everything about it. And it really help since my daughter and I are still new to all of this. And it helps that everything is logged in my phone so I can look back on it and let her doctors know how she is doing.

Title: Best Diabetes Teacker App
----------------------------------------------------------
I have type 2 diabetes and I'm young and need to keep my diabetes in track. I test 3 times a day and log my weight as well. This App is very helpful for me to show my doctor my progress or if my blood sugars are high and for how long. It was well worth the money and is a valuable tool to aid in diabetes care. I highly suggest that if you have either form if diabetes that you get the App and use it daily.

Title: Exactly what the doctor ordered
----------------------------------------------------------
We have been looking for an app like this for a while. Something that could be accessed on mobile and desktop. Everything is stored in one place which we can access at home and on the road. The charts are really helpful too. Also, logging food is amazing. You can scan bar codes! And, they add them for you if your food is not in the database. Such a great tool so far. Hope iPad version comes out as well.

Title: Very complete app
----------------------------------------------------------
I use the food log, as well as the exercise log and the medication log.  The food log has a very large database.  You will find most foods in there, especially if you eat a lot of processed and packaged foods.  It is a bit more difficult if you cook for yourself.  The medication log has been helpful to see if I've forgotten to take meds.  I don't have diabetes, but the diabetes tracker looks useful.

----------------------------------------------------------
I'm a Weight Watcher but their app doesn't indicate all the nutrients like this app. This is the most accurate app for diabetics. The food database is extensive and I love being able to scan foods and the way it saves them as favorites automatically. This app works super great and is so economical. I think there are over 750,000 foods in the database. Love it and I never have a problem with it!!!!!

----------------------------------------------------------
MyNetDiary is a thorough, intuitive app that could be helpful for anyone that is attempting to get a handle on what they are eating, and when. Or anyone who wants to track various things such as medications, or water intake, or certain exercises. But it's especially helpful for any diabetic that is determined to get BG under control, helping you to see patterns and weak spots. Good luck out there!

This is a really good app. It is the best I have used. It has the ability to chart the medicines that I take, track my sleep, if I charge the watch before going to bed, counts the steps and exercise that I have done today. There is a recipe that you write down all the ingredients and then you tell the app how much of the serving you have eaten and it calculates the nutrition and calories eaten.

This app is the best app for logging and analyzing food consumption.  My endocrinologist was amazed at the details I provided her. This app should be provided to all diabetics when first told they have diabetes.  Great APP.  The reports portion should be allowed in all levels of the app.  The app warrants a 5 star rating. After using this app for the past few year, I am still impressed.

Title: Great App for Diabetics
----------------------------------------------------------
I log everything from BG numbers, exercise, medication, vitamins, and all food eaten.  This is extremely useful to me in evaluating any changes necessary to my diet or medication.  Creating your own food categories made it very easy to catalog what I eat regularly and the bar code scanner is awesome.  I also like how I can print out daily or weekly reports or email them to my doctor.

Title: Excellent for Type 20
----------------------------------------------------------
I rarely write an app review, but I have great respect for this one. It covers every area of the disease that I can think of. It keeps me accountable and honest. Seeing my numbers along with the other data helps me notice things I would not if I weren't keeping track. It's easy, educational, and I share the info from here with my doctor as it is most accurate. I highly recommend it!
