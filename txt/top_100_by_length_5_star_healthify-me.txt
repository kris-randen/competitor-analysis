Title: Value for money - Improving health, fitness and Wealth
----------------------------------------------------------
An app that can change course and set it right to improve and build health and fitness and also to an extent remove the daily pill for sugar and blood pressure by combining diet and exercise .  Healthify studio brings in the expert coach home to get you fit and strong.  I love the features of the app and am a great fan.  The health records enable one to quantify progress made over time on key parameters, tracking health progress with proper diet and exercise .  A supporting tool for all who wish to make drastic improvements to pave way for great health and fitness . What endears me the most is the new feature -  ‘insights’ that provides info on micro and macro nutrients after each meal, day after day informing and enabling the  actions that can be taken to improve health.  I live all the features of the app that inspires, informs, motivates and easily the best to gain and achieve great health results .

Title: Not just an app, but the system of discipline
----------------------------------------------------------
Though I practice yoga and vegetarian food habits & very saatvik lifestyle, I am not a health freak. When my body health went slightly out of control, I have downloaded this app; and within a week, Healthifyme has brought me back in track and disciplined my daily food regime. Ria is an excellent source of feedback and knowledge. Due to this disciplined approach, I have lost 8 kgs and went back to my normal self. Over the time, one enjoys entering details of what he or she has eaten, everyday and becomes conscious of what’s good and what’s not good, what are good calories and what are bad calories. That’s what I love about this app. Yes, I had very miserable time with the nutritionist. None of them were prompt and consistent.

Informative ,easy to use,provides analysis on the nutrient value of calories consumed ,its easy to keep track of calories taken in at every meal ,helps balance calorie intake for different meals as in breakfast morning snack lunch etc ,I became more aware of the caloric and nutrient value of the various food items I mindlessly use to consume earlier ! I still indulge in junk food but with awareness and responsibility ,I especially like the repeated reminder for water intake as we tend to forget regular intake of water even though we are aware of the necessity of consuming eight glasses of water per day ,all the extra information regarding nutrition fitness and holistic health is helpful inspiring and handy .

Title: Effective if tracked religiously
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using the app religiously for the past year. Initially along with few exercises, I was able to come down from 79 kg to 65 kg in 6 months. I track every food and drink that I consume. Exercises are also tracked. Keeping track and seeing the excess calories you tend to take some days reminds you of your target goal. This app surprisingly has almost all the food in the database, even the very rare ones you think may not be there. I recommend this app to those who plan to bring down their weight. I must also say that simply controlling your calorie intake alone will not help. You definitely have to do some form of exercises as well for faster change.

Title: Not leveraging all my Apple Health Data
----------------------------------------------------------
I see that there are a bunch of trackers included in the app. Many of these are already being recorded into Apple Health app using various other apps. Specifically, I record my water consumption using WaterMinder which in turn stored the information into Apple Health. My weight (and a bunch of other parameters) is recorded using Xiaomi’s Body Composition Scale and Mi Fit app, which in turn stores the same into Apple Health. My BP is recorded using Omron’s BP monitor and app, which stores the information into Apple Health. Most importantly, a plethora of information is collected by my Apple Watch and stored into Apple Health.

Title: BEST APP EVER!
----------------------------------------------------------
This has come to my like something god sent. I absolutely am in love with this app. Not only does it tell you your target consumption for the day and bifurcated into different meals. Once you punch in the food it tells you the calorie, fat, carbs, protein and fibre count/breakdown of each item consumed. So you can adjust your intakes throughout the day. I am not at all a foodie and because I’m a yoga teacher I would eat less and spend more energy. I have been wanting to gain weight and this app is immensely helpful. And not only to gain weight but the understanding of food and healthy living. AMAZINNG AMAZINNG AMAZING!

Title: Wonderful journey past a year
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been connected to Healthifyme since almost a year. Initially, 1st 2 months were hard for me to follow their routine of exercise and diet. But, eventually I was able to see a slow but steady transformation from 72 kg to below. What I learnt was we need to have patience coz instant is never good. Healthifyme gave me that confident, through their regular check on me. Ananya is one of the dietician who had always kept a check on me, why I have not been able to post my details in app. Now my weight varies from 62 - 63 kgs. I would say, try Healthifyme for a healthy you 😊

Title: Best health app ever used
----------------------------------------------------------
I have dabbled with quite a few calorie counter apps for quite some time. I have tried the so called most popular ones in Appstore but nothing beats this Period. The USP of this app is its extensive database it has got every variety of local food you usually eat along with nutritional info. Hats off thats an achievement in itself. Not to mention the integrators and the coach plans. The integrators integrate with default health app of iOS and tells you the calories you run/walk. Big kudos to the dev team keep it this way don’t change anything..!!!

Title: Much better than my expectations
----------------------------------------------------------
I signed up for this app and paid for smart plan and I talked to a consultant who clearly explained everything in detail for me to lose weight. She pointed out the things I missed to add my diet and recommended me best foods to add to my diet plan. The consultant was very polite. To use this app first hit the gym and workout for 3-4 days and then consult all your doubts via this app and track your calorie intake. The calories you burn out is dependent upon your workout regime. Don’t blame this app for your failures. No pain-No gain.

This is probably the best in the field. Their expert professionals are able to help in terms of diet, workouts (prescribed and the ones in studio), mental health, etc. The calorie tracker tracks macros and micronutrients, it works in tandem with built in phone apps for health. And the trainers are always working towards individual goals for the users. The weight loss/strength training is gradual, healthy and aims at lifestyle change. Their methods are not hearsay and are properly researched and executed by trained professionals.

Title: Lost 20 kgs in 5 months
----------------------------------------------------------
I had history of back pain (herniated disc) which has limited the daily activities and also heavy workout was a strict no to me. The diet coach (AKANKSHA MAM) & fitness coach (VAISHALI MAM) were exceptionally well, they councelled me first and also made me believe that i can loose weight with controlled diet and specially designed exercises. The diet chart and tips shared by AKANKSHA mam were so much effective and exercises from VAISHALI mam helped me to strengthen my lower back. I actually reached 78kg from 98kgs in 5 months.

The app is fantastic, no doubt about it. But recently, I have observed that the application has begun to lag a lot, while searching for food data, while clicking on the various options, such as the add food, add water intake etc, the app lags and well crashes in the end. The development team should take note on this and begin working on it ASAP. This app has been life changing for me. Kindly look into the issue.

I don’t want to talk about it features because it doesn’t need any promotion. Features are designed perfectly so that one can reduce weight by own.

This is by far the best app if you are tracking your calories to stay fit. Just one improvement is needed, there are many who have got result just by using calories tracking. They should be able to post their weight loss stories rather than only those who have purchased diet plans.
