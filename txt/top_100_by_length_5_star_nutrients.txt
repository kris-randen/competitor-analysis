Title: Fantastic App, use it all the time
----------------------------------------------------------
I was considering taking a weekend and researching all of this information to make a food matrix because I needed to up my intake of certain nutrients and wanted to know what foods in my cabinet were the highest in density of said nutrients, and then I found this! What's awesome is it's customizability for those who can't or choose not to eat certain food groups, and it is specific enough to where you can really make educated decisions about certain things. I would like to see further expanding on types of foods, as well as grass-fed vs. grain fed and more beef choices, but other than that, this is the best app anyone looking to improve their nutrition could ask for! Thanks!

Title: Eh..
----------------------------------------------------------
This app came soooo recommended that I pondered for a long time about buying it since it’s 4.99!!! I don’t normally just randomly pay for expensive apps. Yes the library is very extensive. However after journaling all my foods, all the nutrient information is smashed and you can’t see it. I am not sure if I’m missing a feature in the settings that I need to turn off or on. I have no idea but for that reason I am not impressed. I seriously think I just wasted 4.99. I would like a refund. I send a feedback to the company hoping they might fix it or tell me what I’m doing wrong but I haven’t heard back yet. I am not pleased!

Title: Awesome!!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I recently started the Paleo diet since I am trying to become strict about CrossFit and this app is perfect. If you need to measure out your foods to determine Carbs, Protein, and Fat levels, this is the app for you. It allows you to easily find the food you are looking for and displays all the nutritional value you could need. You can even manipulate the amount of the food and it will automatically recalculate the nutritional values based on the amount you selected. Try it!

Title: Best App For Tracking Nutrition IMO
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried multiple other apps for tracking calories and this one is my favorite, hands down. The very simple search interface allows you to find the ENTIRE nutritional profile of an exact portion of food including total calories, total protein, fat, carbs, vitamins, and minerals. On top of that, you can add individual food items or even ENTIRE CUSTOM RECIPES to "your journal" which then keeps track of how much you have eaten for the day. Very happy I purchased this.

----------------------------------------------------------
I find this app to be very helpful for me while trying to find out how much nutrition of what vitamins and minerals i am getting everyday. I have not checked to see how accurate it is but most of the values seembelievable and a few of thr items i knew the values of were accurate. Excellent idea, but could def use some improvement. Look at the other responses for some good ideas on improvements.

----------------------------------------------------------
After a heart attack I really needed a good tool to determine the fat content of my diet. Foodle has a comprehensive, well tended and ever expanding database of nutrition info. It's easy to search and attractively presented. Its built in units conversion ability makes it simple to compare servings of like amounts of diverse foods. Best app for this purpose I could find, and I looked at a bunch.

This is my go to app for nutrient information. It features macro- and micro-nutrient information such as vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. This alone makes the app indispensable. The app has an easy to use interface and a tremendously useful presentation of the nutrient data. You can also specify food quantities in a variety of measures (e.g. grams, ounces, cups, etc.).

Search for a food, change units (if desired), touch "favorite" to save as favorite and/or touch "journal" to enter into my journal.  The design is perfect, in my opinion.  The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to get the total nutritional values for the day based on my journal entries.  It MUST be there - I'm just not seeing it - right?

----------------------------------------------------------
This app is for you if the heading describes you. Knowing empty from potent calories can make all the difference in food choice. It's possible to actually achieve 100% of the RDA on a 2000 calorie diet, and not depend too heavily on vitamin/mineral supplements. I only wish I could synch my lists between devices or a cloud database.

I have been using this app for years and I rely on it more than my other nutritional trackers. The info is robust and accurate, the list of whole foods is great! I would like to add my supplements, but I am forced to use another app for that feature & refer to the tally in the health app. Still, overall an excellent app!
