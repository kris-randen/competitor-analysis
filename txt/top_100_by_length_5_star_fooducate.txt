Title: Best app of its kind - visuals, info, positive msgs, customer support
----------------------------------------------------------
I had Fooducate when I was just getting into the whole food tracking thing and loved it right away. So much so that every other one I tried fell short. And still does. Like any app, you have to log your food. But you can scan it, create recipes, and it’s there. It’s NOT a big deal. If you are invested enough in what goes into your body, this is part of it. I was fascinated by what I didn’t even realize — especially how many carbs I was mindlessly getting. What I LOVE about this app is the easy graphics but also the unmatched scope of its info, and its whole attitude. Instead of feeling like I was depriving myself of something, it gave me GOALS. Getting enough protein has always been a struggle for me so this made it a goal. How close did I get to achieving that goal as the day went on? Well if I was only halfway there, I guess dinner had to be some salmon or chicken instead of corn flakes! EASY. It’s also one of the few apps that factors in things that are important - dietary plans chemicals and processed foods,gluten, vegetarian, allergies, etc. I know My Fitness Pal is getting a ton of play right now thanks to Under Armour’s financial backing but I’ve used both and went running back to Fooducate.  I have been hassling their customer service for a week now because I had paid for an unlimited subscription that I thought I didn’t get back, but it was right there. I would like them to make the upgraded version a different logo so you could tell the difference. I find this to be the most user friendly, make you make good choices, not punish you when you don’t, adapt to your personal preferences, food tracker out there. It incorporates the exercise calories burned as reported by my fitness tracker too. FOR SURE GET FOODUCATE.

Title: Don't pay for the monthly or the one time 39$
----------------------------------------------------------
STICK WITH THE FREE VERSION!!! This app does have some good information about dieting and ways to help you eat better but nothing that you can't find online or through another source for free. They also have a very small list of foods in their information bank unless you eat a very simple and small variety of foods. For example I have a hard time finding restaurant foods in the app and I often times can't find the items I scan and it leaves me doing all the heavy lifting on getting the information in the app. I followed the instructions on taking a picture of the item and emailing it to the fooducate team only to get a response from them saying they want me to send more information from the product after I sent them everything they asked for. What more do they need other than the nutritional facts, ingredients and name of the product that I need to type out a report on a simple item? Talk about a scam, I spend more time with this app trying to figure out how I am gonna be able to enter what foods in eating rather than tracking my health through what I eat. Not to mention this app does not automatically keep track of my steps so I have to enter that manually as well. I paid the 39$ and I feel like just got robbed after using the app for a week. I expected a lot more for what I paid. STICK WITH THE FREE VERSION!!! Hopefully I can change my review in the future.

Title: LOVING THIS APP AND NOW WITH THE NEW UPDATE SCANNING IS BETTER AND IPOD SUPPORTED!
----------------------------------------------------------
Fooducate inspires “wow that is cool” to me, scanning bar tags near instantly is pretty sweet, then pulling up a good amount of data on the product, even cooler. Eating well from pre-packaged food is a near impossibility anymore. Every single item in the store has a catch. Hidden sodium content, extra carbs, lack of protein, you name it. Fooducate helps with the decision whether to pick something up or put it down for good, an in-store, hand-held guilt trip. Point your iPhone or iPod with camera at a bar code and wait the 3 seconds for it to give you a grade on the healthiness of any product at your grocery store. It is super simple and quick as hell finding the info on your item. It includes a large amount of information on each product also, not just providing the grade, it tells you why it gives that grade, what the problem with the product is (30% of your daily salt in 1 serving, 1/2, of 1 can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli), alternative products to what you’ve scanned that are better options,  and details about the red flags affecting the grade. It is pretty depressing to know your lunch is 60% of your entire daily allotment of salt, knowing you’re killing yourself with ravioli is pretty damned depressing.

Title: Wonderful tool that works
----------------------------------------------------------
Just recently put it to use since January 2017! Very happy with the outcome, it was exactly what I needed to lose 10-11 pounds to get to my ideal weight. I noticed i would go up about pound each week since I am in between moving and staying at hotels, eating out etc. I said nooo I have to do something.  Firstly, I love food and look forward to eating, I was doubtful because I've never been a calorie counter and wasn't working out regularly.  After actually logging in all my meals, snacks, any physical activity, even walking, taking stairs (anything and  everything counts) I got to see that I was actually eating too much of certain things although satisfied with less.  Once I was aware of that it was actually easy to stay under the limit and not feel deprived.  It was the easiest thing I've done towards actively losing weight. I became aware of what calories certain things have and how clean the food is.  It's all in the database, you can also scan the item and select the portion.  They just made it so easy, like a food diary but easier, little effort. Give it a try, it works! I would say I lost the 10 lbs over a 2 month period.

Title: Awesome
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is perfect for watching what you eat, getting a breakdown of the nutritional content, or lack thereof, of most of the food you can find on any store shelf. This app has helped me broaden my diet by showing me healthy alternatives to a lot of the home-name brands you'll find in any store. This is one of the few apps you'll be using on a daily basis to manage your diet--and managing your diet is extremely important. This app gives alerts for and detailed explanations for things such as GMO's, artificial coloring, artificial flavored, etc... Do yourself a favor and try this app. It is customizable and is both developer and community supported. If there's a product you can't find by scanning, you can upload it to the database for everyone else. Oh yeah, and you can scan products in the store, or anytime using this app to get detailed information about the product. A must-have for anyone's phone! Also, I am rocking this app on an iPhone 4 with iOS 6. No issues creating an account or accessing anything in the app.

Title: Super informative app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to use myfitnesspal but kind of fell off the wagon and thus searched for a more interesting app for food logging. I came across this app and decided to give it a try and I'm glad that I did! It's an interesting app and with an update to expand the food bank I think this app is a hands down 5! I love that all foods in the food search come with pictures next to them as an icon, so you can easily spot the food you are looking for! It's really handy. Also, it gives you a GRADE on the food! Love this! And not only does it give a grade for the food it tells you WHY! dun dun dun! I love it. And the cherry on top is that it also has informative articles on food as well as it disects the pesky nutrition info label and explains to you what is really in your food. Absolutely love that. This way you know what you're eating, why it's good or not too good for you, healthier substitutions, and you learn the ingredients that you may want to omit or keep eating. Amazing!

Title: Best weight loss tool ! Ever!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Finally something that can help me truly breakdown what I am eating throughout the day. I was on WW counting points diligently and exercising 4-5 x a week. My weight was coming off but ridiculously slow. It wasn't making sense. Plus I was crabby and always hungry !!! How could I be eating in my point range , exercising and not losing weight?!!! Grrrr! Enter Foodeducate. A coworker told us about it and I was intrigued. So started using it AND checking my points with  WW. Guess what? Sure I was eating enough points but what WW wasn't telling me was , I was eating way too much sodium, too many carbs, not enough protein. Since adjusting these things it is bloody amazing how different I feel. Energized, full, not craving my love, cookies. And guess what? Losing weight!!!! If you want to really to get healthy cause that is the key , not just counting calories or points but this app helps you get healthy!!!

Title: Great for daily tracking!
----------------------------------------------------------
I absolutely love this app! You can keep track of everything on a daily basis. Track what you eat, drink, track your exercise, there's even a section to make notes about your progress, how you feel etc... I like the fact that you can look up foods, drinks and even supplements. There's a barcode scanner to find foods and if the scanned product isn't in the database you can add it! I've been having some health issues so this app has proved very valuable to me. I'm not using it to help lose weight but to keep track of what I eat, supplements I take and how I feel on a day to day basis. I use it like a food diary so I can look back to see if there's something I ate that made me feel bad. The bonus is it keeps track of my weight loss as well. If you're looking to lose weight or keeping track of what you eat for other health reasons, I can't recommend this app enough. Two Thumbs Up!!!

Title: Amazing and even with the update I still love it!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has been wonderful😉! It has help me to make better food choices for myself and family. Learning how to read food labels can be hard, not only do you need to know how to read them but you need to know all of the big words that go along with the label😳. This program has made it idiot proof. It breaks it all done for you and explains the who's, what and why😊. To add a grading system A - D for rating the product was brilliant 👍. And yes ....it is true it takes a few weeks for them to get the products that you have requested but they are nice enough to send you an e-mail that states it is going to take time due to the number of request that they receive and you will be notified once they have your information for the product you have requested. 🆗.... It is not the end of the world. My suggestion is to eat something else until the information is sent to you. It is what I do😉.

Title: Amazing app - so educational. I thought I was eating healthy until this app.
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m an avid runner and also enjoy many other cross training activities and have recently started to eat healthier since reading some books on running and what the top athletes eat. i’m amazed at what is often portrayed as being healthy actually contains so much sugar or is highly processed. Now I scan every food item before I buy it and many items I used to eat now don’t make the cut, from cereals, to health bars, juices, salad accessories etc. I’m not trying to lose much more weight as I often burn more than I can consume, but understanding what I put into my body and the negative effect food can have on your health and the increased risk of disease the information you get from this app is what the FDA should be mandating to have on every product. It’s only through easy access to information like this that we can start to solve many of the weight and health problems we have.

Title: Powerful!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is so Amazing! I have been struggling with my weight and wanted to track food "points" without the heavy expense of weight watchers. This app is the best for this! The design is so intuitive. I am able to scan bar codes and add items to my food tracker very easy (easier than I remember the WW app being). I also can track my weight, my calories consumed, my exercise activity & my body measurements all in the same app! I love the articles in the daily tips section and love the shopping list feature as well. This app even tracks my use of weekly "bank" points in the event that I go over my daily allotment of food points!!!! Words cannot describe how much Fooducate means to me. I was depressed and upset over my weight issue but this app has given me peace of mind. Thank you from the bottom of my heart and keep up the great work developers of Fooducate!

Title: GREAT app!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Love this app! But beware, if you want to put your head in the sand and don't want to be aware of all the crap we are eating that's making us sick, this might not be for you. No one can read all the labels and know what is truly in our food, good or bad. This app helps sort all that out quickly. My family is getting better food....No more D rated food in our house! Working on getting the "C's" out too. My only complaint is not with the app but with the grocery stores. Some of the alternative choices recommended can only be found in specialty and health food stores, few of which exists in our "behind the times" city. Hopefully this app will be seen by large chains and food companies and realize that we are tired of buying their junky food. If you like Eat This, Not That books, you will like this app! Best and most used app I have.

Title: ACTUALLY WORKS!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am a fitness and nutrition enthusiast and I absolutely LOVE this app.  I am NOT a perfectly healthy eater and I have about 15 pounds to lose still but this app helps keep me on track.  It is so easy to use and readily accessible on your phone without draining your battery.  The scanning of bar codes is the BEST THING EVER!!  It automatically tracks for you ( all you do is put in how many servings you had) and raises your awareness of what/ how much you are eating.  I love the ways you can personalize the app to your specific health goals.  I also like the fact that you can see progress charted out for you.  I like being able to add foods in if they are not in the database.  Execellent design, fantastic ease-of-use and a truly EFFECTIVE motivator and health improver!!! I guess I really like this app, right?

Title: A game changer
----------------------------------------------------------
This app really empowers people to take charge of their health and get informed. I've recently discovered the adverse effects of sugar thanks to the documentary "Fed Up" and the research from Dr. Robert Lustig, and I am so pleased to see that Fooducate agrees and tracks added sugars specifically! You can see not just how many calories you're taking in, but the quality of the calories you're putting in your body. I've been using this app to do the 10-Day No Sugar challenge and it's been so helpful in educating me about my food so I personally understanding the things I'm eating. My one complaint is I wish entering recipes was a bit easier with actual cooking measurements to choose. Cooking at home is essential to healthy eating so I hope one day to see this app make adding recipes a cinch! Love this app :)

Title: 5-stars!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I absolutely love this app! I downloaded Fooducate a while back when I had a bit of extra weight I wanted to lose and fell in love with it. It really helped me become more aware of the food I was eating and the different ways food labels trick us into eating unhealthy foods. I scan literally every new food I choose when I’m in the supermarket to make sure I am keeping in line with my health goals. Anytime I hear about new nutrition trends/ingredients/products, Fooducate is the first place I go to check it out.  I also love how the app shows me if a food I scan has nightshades in it. I have a major food sensitivity to nightshades and they are often hidden in the ingredients, so this makes my life way easier! This app has changed the way I look at the foods I eat and helped me so much in my health journey.

Title: Amazing and motivating!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is great! It encouraged me to begin being smarter about my food choices! I now became interested in actually looking at the nutrition facts To make choices on my food! It feels great to enter a good nutritional item on the health tracker, and entering a not so nutritious item just encourages you eat even better! It's very nice to see all the food you ate throughout the day laid out in one table! I rarely find an item not entered in the food catalog, so most of my food entries are already filled in! I also love the burn feature which allows you to enter the type of activity you did and calculate the amount of calories you burned subtracting that from your total daily calorie intake! I would highly recommend this app for anyone not only trying to lose weight but eating healthier!

----------------------------------------------------------
I have to say that this may be the most used app I have. I have shared it with just about everyone I know and they too have given me rave reviews! Who knew that even some of the things I thought were "healthy" could have so many sneaky ingredients. I love that I can actually understand the information I'm given on the different products, makes it much more real time for my hectic life. I try to make the best choices everyday for my family and this app has made it a little easier to navigate the grocery store. I've even turned it into a game for my kids. If they want something that's not really healthy, I'll let them scan the item and see what grade it gets. If its under a C, they get to pick an item from the "alternatives" section instead. Thanks for such a great tool!

Title: Great for keeping track of daily caloric intake
----------------------------------------------------------
This app helps me to stay within and on target of my caloric intake in order to lose weight. By carefully following the recommended calorie requirement to lose 1.5 pounds per week I have been losing the weight. It helps me to see if a food item is healthy or not. I really like this app. I use the daily tracker firme 3 meals a day and a snack. It can even track the exercise I do by letting me input the calories I burned daily and it will compute that info into my daily caloric intake. If I don't exercise I know I need to eat unprocessed foods and small portions in order to get an A grade for the day and stay within my caloric intake to keep losing the weight, I choose to exercise and diet daily to get to a healthy weight and this app is helping me achieve that.

Title: A health nuts dream
----------------------------------------------------------
I've seriously learned so much from this app. It is SO educational. This sets it apart from other health trackers and food logging apps. It doesn't just focus on calories when determining when a food is good or bad or just okay for you- it will point out and explain controversial chemical ingredients, ridiculous sodium levels, ect. If you don't like reading into all of the nitty gritty things it says you can just focus on the clear grades it gives the foods you scan. You can use this app to find out what kind of cereal/ketchup/bread/anything is the best and worst for you from the grading system. Truly a great tool. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to learn what they are REALLY putting in their mouths or how to live with a healthier lifestyle.

This app is extremely helpful and I'm so happy that I found it. There are others out there like it but I really like the grading system and even the "fooducational" posts. It is very user friendly and I have definitely helped my parents by introducing it to them for their high blood pressure. I have not purchased the pro version yet but I may do so after I start using it consistently (daily). It has really helped with grocery shopping too. I definitely recommend this to anyone that wishes to count calories on their own or count food points without a fad diet guru or a weight loss system. I would give more stars because 5 is inadequate of the tremendous help this will be to me. I had myfitnesspal and others but this is so far the best. The others bored me

Title: A must-have
----------------------------------------------------------
Even if you think you know a lot about nutrition, you need this app. I've taken it on one shopping trip and I've already learned so much. For example, that my favorite popcorn has sucralose in it and that fig newtons have trans fats-- even though the label doesn't tell you (!). If you buy a single thing from the middle aisles, using this app will change the way you shop and the way you eat. I used to spend a lot of time reading labels and scouring ingredients lists, calculating the pros and cons of one item before moving on to the next-- and probably still not making the best choices. With this app, my "pocket dietician" does all the work for me in a matter of seconds (and it's fun) and I feel confident that my family will be healthier as a result.

Title: Answer to Prayer.
----------------------------------------------------------
It is BAD times when we can no longer make shopping choices by reading the labels. This app empowers shoppers by allowing the shopper to get a rundown of any hidden EVILS in their favorite foods. So far 4 people have downloaded this app on the spot after asking me why I was scanning my food selections. One conversation I had with a stranger was overheard by a district manager while he was 'stocking'. He hung onto every word while this male shopper and I were complaining about GMO's and how we appreciated the "health food isle".  This store plans on eliminating this isle and intermixing the products into the regular floor plan... A fact I am not happy about. So... This app came at the right time for me and I am thankful for this answer to prayer.

Title: Great App!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app for a couple of years now, and when I want to know about a product this is where I turn. All I do is scan the product to get nutritional insight, as well as , opinions of other users. Some of my favorite things about this app is the explanations for the grade that has been given to the foods and how it provides a product that is better Is better in Its category. Tracking overall food intake is great, but knowing exactly what I am putting my body is better! Yeah, It cool to read the labels and all, but the label don't explain what the chemicals are or how they could harm you. That's an advantage from this app.  Best app ever! I am considering upgrading, but the free version has served me well!

----------------------------------------------------------
I also have an iPhone 4 and had no troubles with the app working fine.  I just took a tour of my frig and pantry with it, and it worked beautifully.  There were several items that were not in the database, but the app makes it super easy to instantly take photos of the product and email the company to update their database.  Several items received a B or a B- but it was not clear as to why (as in, all of the comments were positive about the product so why not a higher rating?).  The alternatives were usually helpful, but in some cases were foods that were relatively different than the original. It was a lot of fun though, and as someone who works in the field of nutrition, I think this app will be very useful.

Title: So Excited I Found This Ap!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this ap. I did weight watchers for 8 months and although their ap is good its expensive 18/a month. & W.W. uses a point system and doesn't focus on clean eating. Using W.W. ap I was confused about what the points represented and what was truly healthy what my net calories were for the day etc. their new plan is extremely confusing.  I found Fooducate and used it for a week & cancelled my weight watchers subscription. I have a better understanding of health, calories, what to avoid, where i am at on net calories and exercise with Fooducate I love it! I highly recommend this ap for people for nutrition and health info, for weight loss, and for tracking calories in and calories out. Thank you Fooducate!

Title: Best decision I’ve ever made!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been eating foods and wondering what’s inside them each day and have yet to find an app that does that and more. So when I stumbled open this I felt amazing! The app was well organized and as a played around with it I enjoyed the fact that I could scan foods in store to find out if they are healthy or not and why! This app taught me a lot about harmful things in Our everyday food and how to save money and be healthy! I especially like the tracker which is the first one I have ever gotten that works and preforms amazingly without having any charge. If you are looking to know what’s in your food and how to track and improve your health download fooducate (lol I sound like a ad) this app is awesome!!

Title: Everyone should use this App!
----------------------------------------------------------
Very easy to use and informative. It validates the choices you are making or shows you the "healthy" choices are actually C or D. From sugar in your steamable veggies to 3x the daily salt in your veggie deli sandwich, but the app doesn't just stop there-when you discover the grade of the food you love isn't great-it suggest similar better grade receiving products. You can also explore products to see what is suggested in different food groups. Really impressed with how many products they have graded too. I have used paid food scanners and often they don't have the unique vegetarian, vegan, or small brand items-I have only found a few items on here that aren't listed and you can send a request to add it.

Title: Great way to set goals and stay on track
----------------------------------------------------------
I use Fooducate when I need to get on track and start budgeting my food intake. I have a tendency to start eating more over time. When I find the scale is creeping up I use it as a food diary and it gets me back to eating properly. I did Weight Watchers years ago and found the “tracking “ useful to become more aware of what I’m eating and make changes. Fooducate is really handy for that. And it lets you input your weight and weight loss goals and then calculates your food intake you need to achieve that. It gives you a lot of flexibility to decide how long you’d like to take. It also grades your food choices. I was surprised to find that Samoa Girl Scout cookies have trans fats. Tasty but not worth it.

Title: Super helpful and awesome!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is perfect! 90% of the items I scan or search for they have in the database, even restaurant/fast food items!! I love that it tells you all the really important facts on the first page then you can click and see a lot more detailed info on the product. The "alternatives" button is great. If an item you scan has a bad grade, but you love it, click on alternatives and you get a huge list of items closely related. This is so helpful and I'm learning new things everyday. Being health conscious should be a top priority for everyone and this app makes it really easy. Totally worth the download in my opinion. If you really love being healthy and taking care of your body, this app will not disappoint!

Title: Lots of work needed on this app
----------------------------------------------------------
It's great to track what u eat and the first few days it was fun, but soon the search process gets tedious as u accumulate more foods in your list. Users need to be able to delete foods u no longer want on ur list. Users need to be able to copy from one day to the next, i.e., if u have oatmeal 5 days a week, u should be able to copy that and not have to search thru a long list. I like the scan feature and it's helpful while shopping and to raise awareness about what we're eating. It will definitely  help me buy healthier food and stop buying some staples I keep in my kitchen. Yes, some good stuff, but needs more work. I contacted support once and they emailed me right back - kudos. Keep improving.

Title: Great App
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a great app for really understanding what you are putting into your body. I love that it also gives you healthier alternatives to replace unhealthy foods with. It’s so easy to scan the barcode of the food you want to know more about and instantly you can see the grade of the food and why it received the grade it did. There are so many hidden potential dangers in our foods today. If your scanned item isn’t in their system you can have them add it by submitting some data to the makers of the app and they will return with your item added and graded. Fantastic app! It makes transitioning to healthier eating seem more attainable by providing knowledge and makes it fun because it’s interactive.

Title: Woke me up!
----------------------------------------------------------
Great experience with this app so far. Unlike other diet/health apps, this one tells you the cold, hard truth about what you're consuming and how healthy your current diet really is. It does this through a color-coded grading scale of A to D. In addition, it has everything you would expect and more out of a diet app, including a barcode scanner, list of ingredients for every product, a daily calorie/food log, etc. It has a community forum where users can post and talk, it allows users to contribute by adding images to products that are missing them, and it suggests alternatives to all of those products. There is much incentive through this app for you to get off your lazy a** and fix your health.

----------------------------------------------------------
That the database is able to constantly expand due to user support is just amazing. Also having access to so much information, from recipes to individual nutritional values along with explanations and alternatives, allows one to really personalize any dietary goals and habits to their liking. What's more, this app allows for exercise input to calculate calorie burn alongside intake. Meals can be saved, recipes favorited, authors followed, goals changed, calorie quality rated, products scanned, entered, or searched, or submitted, and there is perpetual support from the community. If ever you were wanting to make healthier choices and change your food-centric lifestyle, this is an app you want.

Title: Makes eating healthier easy.
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app so much. I never write reviews, but I just took notice of how often I use Fooducate. I especially love the built in shopping list so I don't have to switch in between apps. I make it a personal goal to only eat foods earning at least a B. There are some products that have lower/higher ratings than they deserve and those with too low of a rating are usually corrected but I feel like that is only to make people happy. Salads with 30% saturated fat, 31% sugars and high cholesterol should NOT receive an A-. I think it would be cool to see some pre-programmed menus/shopping lists in this app. Don't know if that will happen, though. Love this app regardless and highly suggest it.

----------------------------------------------------------
The foods ate app has been very helpful to watch my carbs, calories, fat, sugar, and sodium, intake. To my delight it also helps you track your calcium and other nutrients. The tips and reports they have have taught me a few things I was unaware of, and not to bost, but I am more knowledgable on health, nutrients and preventative medicine than most. The help this App gives, gives you the real time info that aides you to stay on track with your goals and needs. So you naturally being more informed make better choices. I can say it motivates you to make better choices and create healthy habits that fulfill the foodie in you as well as the inner athlete and healthy content spirit.

----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app! I am eating mostly whole foods however not everything I eat is so the scanning ability it has is great! If you are new to eating healthier this will help you tremendously. They have a free version but I wanted to be able to get more information so I chose to pay for the app. I didn't even use the free app one day before deciding to go with the paid version. I'm not an expert but I do not want to eat food that has been genetically modified so I love the feature it has that tells me whether it is or isn't GMO. I like that it grades a product and then tells you why it got the grade. I would like foods to be verified quicker so that my final reading is accurate.

Title: A very useful tool
----------------------------------------------------------
I have struggled for years to lose weight. Sometimes successfully, other times, not so much. I have found Fooducate to be a much more useful tool than others I have tried. The thing is, its on me to actually enter in the food I’ve eaten and this app makes it very easy to do so. I also love how it figures out the calories I need to reach my goals. The grades for food are extremely helpful when at the supermarket trying to determine what I should or should not buy. Lastly, I like that it gives me alternatives to the “bad” foods. That way I can make up my mind if I want an apple or a highly processed bar of some kind that might be labeled as healthy but in reality is not.

Title: Best health tracking up out there
----------------------------------------------------------
This app really tracks what you eat, and makes it so much easier. You just scan the food you eat and most if not all of them are available, and the choices are growing everyday. It really opened my eyes through a lot of things. The app doesn't leave you alone to figure out how to keep healthy! It has newsletters, community sections, recipe ideas submitted by the app users, etc. It's so involved in what you do, you don't need safari to get through. I highly recommend this app before trying others. So thankful this exists. Other health tracking apps aren't this simple and fun. It's colorful and inviting, this is the only health tracking app I'll ever use. You'll love it

----------------------------------------------------------
I told my boyfriend I wanted an app that calculated my nutrient and caloric intake by using a database that knows what nutrients are in specific brands and other more general things like an apple. I discovered this app shortly after telling him that and this app does exactly that. You can look up your favorite brands and it is so easy to add it in to what you ate today. You don't have to look at the panel and enter in every % this app does it for you. You can even look up menu items from your favorite restaurants and the app will tell you if it fits your diet and fitness goals. This app will really help me transition in to a vegan lifestyle and be healthy about it!

Title: An excellent calorie tracker and educational too!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app! It is far different from the other calories tracker app because it also educates you and grades certain foods. It informs you whether the food or drink you consume is healthy for you by grading it. For example if the food is healthy enough to eat the app grades it at A+ or close to that and if the food is unhealthy to eat, the app grades the food closer to a letter D. This really has educated me based on the grading scores of the foods. It truly helps me stay away from the bad and unhealthy foods out there. It’s also community based so the list of foods just keeps growing and growing. I totally recommend this to anyone trying to get fit/healthy.

----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using Fooducate for about four months now and it has been instrumental in helping me attain and maintain the goals I have set out for myself. I have not upgraded the app but am considering it to fine tune my intakes. One of the thing that sets this app apart from other calorie counting apps is the letter-grade rating of the foods you are eating. Therefore, while watching the number of calories you are eating, you are also looking at the quality of the calories being eaten.  There are a couple of things that can be improved, such as west coast food and ethnic food selections, but overall the app is fantastic and I have recommended it to many people.

I love this app ! I think it's  really the best app out there. It teaches you quantity, Quality and exactly what you're putting in your body. It really brings to your attention how much you actually are eating when you are recording it. I was surprised how many few bites here and there and how much they added up. The quality of what I thought !, I was purchasing and what I was actually getting. To be able to estimate all my daily activities to know what I actually burned. The quality of  food knowledge and updates is invaluable and unlike any other app out there for A healthy lifestyle! The only improvement is to delete doubles n triples of same products.

This app is amazing. Nothing like picking up Jif peanut butter like you always have because "choosey mom's choose Jif" rings in your ears every time you're shopping...only to do a search and alternative find and discover, *GASP* Skippy is way better for your kids...and if you want to go one step further, an all natural alternative is available. Try giving your kids a peanut butter that is made from nothing but peanuts rather than one packing some form of syrup or hydrogenated oil as the key ingredients. Now I do this with nearly everything I buy thanks to fooducate, and have dropped 10 pounds with little awareness I've even made a lifestyle change.

----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this app because of the food grades. It shocks me to realize what are Cs and Ds that I thought were better. It's only been a week and I won't say it's changed my bad habits completely, but the detail analysis it provides is very helpful/insightful. I want to subscribe to Pro, but I can't remember my Apple Restrictions password to purchase in App and there's not a Pro option to purchase directly from the App stores, so I can't (Can you fix that?). The only con I have is that the database of food is kind of limited (250k I believe), but you can always add your own recipes and they're quick about adding something that they can verify.

About a year or two ago, my older sister discovered this app. She kept praising it endlessly, and when she showed me how it works, I (being the stubborn younger child) begrudgingly admitted it was cool. Skip to about a month ago: I was in a human nutrition college class, but it was my first class of that nature, and I was very lost with the material. I decided to look up the app my sister was telling me about then. It's not only saved my grades in the class with it's easy-to-understand explanations, but now I'm using it constantly and taking nutrition to heart. Never thought I'd be a health fanatic like my sister, but I'm happy I've become one!

This is by far one of my FAVORITE apps; it is AWESOME!  I recently scanned one of my seemingly healthy/favorite cereals, one in which I sometimes give my 17 month old son to eat in the morning, and found out it has a very controversial chemical in it! One used in embalming fluid!!! What?!! I was blown away! Also, it's VERY easy to add products (if you scan an item and it's not in the system). Once they've added it, they will send a message via your Fooducate Inbox to let you know it's been posted and what the results are. I've been called a "food snob" because I tend to eat healthier foods/brands. I find this app incredibly USEFUL and FUN!  

Title: Best food logging app ever!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app for logging food. It has been so easy to use. I love the grading system, the breakdown of how much real food vs processed food. Also the breakdown percentage of carbs, fat and Protein  It's so awesome that it even calculates how much natural sugars and added sugars are consumed. Big bonus that it links my workouts for my other apps and automatically adds them. My only suggestion to improve it for consumers is that calculating fiber not be a upgrade but a standard feature. It is so critical for good health and a big component in the fight against obesity and diabetes to make it a standard feature would be the right thing to do.

----------------------------------------------------------
Fooducate has changed my life. Literally. I did weight watchers, fitness pal, lose it, lifesum and others. They are nice but never worked for me because of the focus on calories only. This app opened my eyes to the source of calories - the actual ingredients that go into foods. I learned that a lot of the low fat and low carb food I had been eating for years were full of unhealthy ingredients. I swapped out these foods for healthier suggestions made by fooducate and things started to change! Today I’m 32 lbs lighter, and find it easy to maintain  my healthy eating habits without thinking of myself as being on a weight loss diet. Thank you!!

----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using this app for a long time.  It's great because it makes you aware of your choices in food.  It tells you about all the good and bad ingredients just by scanning the bar code.  If the food item itself gets a low grade, it will give you healthier options! I use this app all the time.  I just don't shop for myself, I shop for my 2 year old as well so I'm constantly looking for healthy options for him.  My husband also loves this app.  He hates having to put in the effort of reading ingredients and researching all the weird chemicals and additives. Just scan it and it's all there for you!!! Simple as pie! Healthy pie that is!  :)

This app has helped a-lot, it forces me to be aware of everything i put in my mouth liquid or solid. The barcode part helps me a-lot when i want to log food quickly and efficiently and the community on this app has helped me a ton with weight loss questions and support. When you start the app it will give you a diet assessment of everything you have ate in 48 hours i believe and it tells you everything! Carbs, fats, proteins, exercise, sleep anything you can think of. Its the only fitness app i use a-lot. I used to be 180 pounds now I'm 178 and my goal is to lose 35 pounds. I recommend this app for anyone who is trying to lose weight.

I was simply looking for a an app to help me make sure I'm covering all my bases and getting enough nutrition in my diet. This is everything I could've asked for and more, and so easy! You can simply scan the barcode of an item and get so much info on it. My first test was with canned tuna: It showed me the nutrition facts, the A through F grade of how good this is for me, info on other similar products with better grades that I'll likely end up buying, and education on how tuna fish makes it's way from sea to can! How cool! So glad I happened upon this. Fooducate lives up to its name: Very educational. So helpful! Thanks!

I just started a vegetarian diet and need to rely on food information much more than I have in the past using the normal criteria for shopping. I was surprised to see that even the products I bought in my local health food store were often not the best choices available. (Ex:  too much sugar; more salt than daily requirements, etc.) Another great feature of this app is that they not only give you info about what you are about to buy as quickly as you can photo the barcode, but with one more click you can see what the better options are- and those products might be right next to the product you were about to purchase!

Title: Just what I needed!
----------------------------------------------------------
Several days ago I came home after my workout discouraged because my monthly measurements showed I gained weight AND body fat. I had recently increased my strength and cardio workouts to 4-5 days a week for 1 1/2 to 2 hours each day. I had also been slowly cutting back on the amount of food I eat which in general is pretty healthy food as far as calories and fat content go. What I didn't realize until I got this app is how many sugars are in even artificial sweeteners, and with my sweet tooth, I was eating way more artificial sweetener than I realized or even cared about. Free calories, right? That was my thinking.

Title: Easier than counting calories
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using this app for about a week. I'm also a fan of MyFitnessPal because it syncs with my Fitbit. I've taken to tracking my food with Fooducate because I find it easier than counting calories. Although Fooducate also tracks calories,you're always under your goal if you mainly eat foods that are good for you. I'm talking about eating A and B grade foods most of the time. This allows me to eat when I'm hungry without worrying about how many calories I have left because the healthy foods are naturally lower in calories. Fooducate helps me choose healthy alternatives for my favorites without feeling deprived

After getting sick of the layout of the other diet apps, I decided to download this one just to see the grades of the foods I was eating. I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only can you see the facts and grades of the foods you consume, but also track your weight loss. This app has every thing you need in one place and is laid out in a easy and fluid manner. Unlike the other apps that let you list what you've eaten, this app tells you whether or not the calories were worthwhile. Everything I need in one place. This app was a refreshing replacement to the mundane layout of other nutrition and diet ones.

I love this app simple because it gives detail on every product you scan! Love the fact that they show you the alternatives and why that certain food product is good for you. It tells you what ingredients are good for you and what to look or in the ingredients. If the food product is rated in the low range, it will explain why and what ingredients you need to watch out for. This is obviously a great app to use when you go grocery shopping because it lets you scan products to see if it is healthy or not before u even buy it and also change your diet and eat healthier. I highly recommend this app!

Title: Awareness
----------------------------------------------------------
Even if you think you know how many sugars, fats, carbs, lack of protein, etc you have a day... You don't until you keep a food log. And this has been the easiest awareness-centric app I've found (coming from someone thats downloaded 10+). It scans labels, let's you pick portions, and almost always has the food I'm searching for. Suggested improvements would be to allow supplement tracking and or adding items when/if they are juiced or blended. I juice green veggies daily and the nutritional value isn't the same as eating them. So I have to compensate. Otherwise A+ app. Also- link with FitBit!

Get this app today- I promise you won't be sorry.

Title: Fooducate
----------------------------------------------------------
This is the best app I've seen on tracking nutrition, and by far the easiest. As soon as you scan something it gives the product a grade (like A- or C), and explains why that prospect has that grade. I was surprised at how many things I thought were healthy actually weren't. Then it gave me some similar recommendations. This was really valuable, since I like to shop at trader joes and like certain products (like hummus or Greek yogurt). The app was able to tell me which yogurts and hummus were the best at trader joes, so I don't need to run all over town looking for a different brand!

----------------------------------------------------------
This app is amazing! Many times we are misled by words in the packaging like "all natural" "low fat" etc. a simple scan of the product quickly details differently. Many apps are complicated with long explanations but once you scan a product it gives you a grade!! Now we all have been in school and know that an A is better than a C! I find myself at whole foods putting back food that I think it's healthy and when I scan it, it gives it a C-!! If you do get a bad grade on a product there is an alternative tab that gives you suggestions on what you should buy instead!! Great app!!!!

Now I look everything up and check ingredients and once you've don't that a couple of times you really just know what is ok to eat and what to avoid in large quantities. I have lost over 80 pounds using the guidance from this app. Highly recommended.

Title: Now I Remember What I Did Not Like!
----------------------------------------------------------
I could not remember what I did not like about this app, but now I do! Sorry to say it’s after I purchased the “Pro”. When entering a personal recipe, it will not let you enter the recipe amounts (example: the recipe calls for 1/3 Cup Sugar and it will only let you enter their SERVING amount for sugar - 1 teaspoon). You should be able to enter the recipe amount, then the calculation should break it down to serving size, based on the number of servings the recipe yields. What a bummer!!! I live alone and make my recipes so I can freeze portions and not have to cook every meal.

Title: Great app but change all grades from F to A
----------------------------------------------------------
I think this app is great. I take full advantage of their grading scale on food items. After going through multiple explanations on why they grade the way the do ,I’ve concluded it is a very consistent and reliable scale but you have to look out what that products top grade is because it isn’t always an A, I wish they would just make the scale consistent across the board in regard to F-A. Otherwise it is pretty good for helping you track your weight but there are many other apps for that. The community is mostly pleasant and the app is very easy to use. 9/10 would recommend.

Title: Perfect App
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a great app. I’ve used it for years and it’s the only thing that’s worked for me when I want to lose weight. There is a focus on nutrition rather than any specific diet plan. It’s very customizable, you can do points, or calories, set goals and monitor progress in detail. I really enjoy the daily breakdown and looking at the nutritional value of what I ate that day, rather than focusing solely on calories and weight loss. For me personally, that motivation to keep eating healthy because it keeps me thinking about what I’m putting in my body. I’ve lost 30lbs in total.

Title: Awesome and informative
----------------------------------------------------------
Great product. Many of the foods I eat are already in the database and those that aren't I can put in myself and enter in the nutritional facts. Makes it extremely easy to keep track of carbs, calories, and food points. Definitely would recommend to others (and I have). I have some food allergies so I purchased the pro version, the only thing I would like to see added would be that when grades are shown for a product, it would show me the grade based off of my personal information as well as the grade that would be given to somebody who didn't have any custom preferences.

Title: Amazing!
----------------------------------------------------------
I absolutely love this app. I've used it for a couple of weeks and love every bit of it. I thought the only downside was some of the foods I eat aren't listed, but they make it ultra easy to get that fixed by an automatic email. All you do is take pictures(with their system)of the label, nutrition label and their ingredients. I love that everything is spelled out right easy for me with grades. The only downside is I've learned the hard truth about American food systems and how corrupt they are with what seems like it'll be healthy and it turns out it's awful for you! ☹️

Trust me, I only write reviews for apps that really deserve it. I love this app. It really helps you keep track of what you eat. When scanning the barcode, it's great to know what I'm eating, and if it's un healthy, I love having the alternatives with it. Yes, you must set up an account, but it only takes a few minutes. There aren't many ads, they don't spam you with emails or anything, and it's free! Please please please get this app. You won't regret it. It's also good to browse through foods to see what I should eat for snacks and meals. GET THIS APP! I love it! 😃😆😋

----------------------------------------------------------
This is a great app that aids you in making healthy food choices for you and your family. It takes the guess work out of translating nutrition labels and it's like having a nutritionist go shopping with you. It's surprising to find out that products you thought were healthy because of labeling actually are not as good for you as they claim to be. I love the "alternatives" feature that allows you to make healthier choices if the product you normally buy doesn't get a good grade. Thank you for this valuable app that allows me to make more nutritional sound food choices!

I've used many calorie trackers over the years and this one impressed me. u can track ur exercise vs food intake like some of the others but it does something even better. It doesn't track just calories, it can track everything else to customize to ur health needs. So at the end of every day it gives u a very user friendly assessment of the quality of the foods u ate (so not just quantity). It simplifies it and this very much appeals to me since I'm usually more interested in my carb intake than calorie. Anyways... This is great and I say it's worth the subscription.

This app is so awesome! I am a huge nut about eating healthy and it's not very easy in the world we live in! This app makes choices simple, you just scan, and see the review on the product, and if you don't like it's grade, it will give you better alternatives!!!! To me, diet is the reason so many Americans are in ill health, and for myself and my kids I will be using this app to lea is to better choices for a healthier future!! They grade the product, and in easy terms explain why the product is or isn't the best option! No more reasons to eat unhealthy people!!!!

----------------------------------------------------------
Pass the word to anyone who'll listen to you on this app. It will warn you on the toxins and GMO's that are in our food supply. It's not survival of the fittest any more but survival of the smartest. You are what you eat and when our food is filled with so much toxins, drugs to make us more hungry to eat more and cancer causing agents (carcinogenic's) then it's no wonder America is filled with fat diabetics who are dying of cancer. This app isn't perfected yet but give them credit for what they've done, and the ARE working on it. Pass the word and use this app.

Upon hearing that my boyfriend downloaded this app, I admit that I was skeptical. It's not hard to identify unhealthy foods; if it is packaged or wrapped it's cause for concern! I downloaded it today at the grocery store to find the safest butter and have used it at least 50 times so far. It is BRILLIANTLY informative as far as specific health concerns ranging from artificial colors to preservatives to sulfites to fiber content...easy to use, amazing app. If an item is not on their database, you can take a pic and send it to them, so they can add it. Well done!

----------------------------------------------------------
I just downloaded this app to help me as I train for my first half marathon and I want to make sure I’m giving my body the nutrients it needs. I also wanted to learn more about the food I eat in the process. WOW- not only is it easy to add foods to your diary, but it explains why they get their health grade/ratings AND offers up suggested alternatives! I only downloaded the free version to see how I like it, but with a little more time to see if it holds up, I’m definitely considering buying the full version (which would then help me with other health goals)!

----------------------------------------------------------
I LOVE this app! I use it every day, multiple times a day for tracking my weight, carbs, etc. but my favorite thing about it is the information you get about food ingredients and suggested alternatives. It has taught me so much and is improving the way my family and I eat. I like that, if the food is not listed in the database, you can take three photos and they are e-mailed to the administrator so it can be added. I also wrote the administrator with a question/ suggestion and received a response (not automatically generated) later that day. Highly recommend!

----------------------------------------------------------
Like this app since it provides the flexibility to lose weight by using points or calories.  I like the ease of scanning an item that is new and indicate number of servings.  I will guess that their database of items will grow. Only gripe I have is to many user entries for the same item.  There has to be a better way to filter through it. I include all the nutritional info and not just the quantity and calories for an item. Try looking for green pepper and you'll see what I mean. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, etc should  already have a standardized list in place.

----------------------------------------------------------
I use this app on my iPhone 4 and since the 2015 update with the new pie chart on the health tracker page, the page now fails to load and gives me a timed out error more times during the day than it loads to allow me to add items. When the phone is trying to load the pie chart it will not allow the phone to do anything else, it does not register a missed call if someone tries to call while it's loading. The new measurements for the recipe or for the health tracker are great additions. I fear I may need to delete the app, since it has gotten difficult to use.

This app was so helpful the other day while I was shopping for groceries. I'm trying to focus on eating healthier, again... This app did the work for me and saved me from having to burn up so much time comparing labels. It's no secret that eating healthier costs more but with Fooducate I can make choices by quickly comparing the facts and not be misled by advertisements. The top "healthy food" brands don't always have the healthiest content compared to other products I could buy. Now I can save $ without sacrificing the health benefit. Thank you Fooducate 

I have now shared this app with my friends and they are loving it as much as I do.  I even added the profile and pet portions and am equally pleased with those as well.  Thank you "Fooducate" for this app. What a life changer!!!

I came from Weight Watchers because it was too much to keep up with. This app feels much more motivational, and is also free with the option of a more specialized paid version. I LOVE how foods are give "grades"; I was pretty surprised because some foods WW said were bad are actually good on this app. I like the community interface a bit more than WW, but I think some people may not - its a big list from what I can tell. Also this app appears more gender balanced versus a large number of women on WW. Love this app and I already lost almost 2lbs in a week.

----------------------------------------------------------
In the past I've seen products like this, but found that they were missing a lot of products from the database.  This app is great because if it doesn't have information on the food item you're researching the app will have you take 3 photos -- front of box, ingredients, and nutrional info -- and then send the information to them so they can add it.  Also, this product doesn't just grade the item you're researching, but it tells you why it deserves that grade and what healthier alternatives might be.  In my opinion this product covers all the bases.

PLUS when I am shopping and I see something that seems to be a healthy alternative but I want to make sure I can scan the barcode and see if it really is a healthy alternative! I recommend this app to EVERYONE and especially anyone who wants to make healthier decisions!

----------------------------------------------------------
This app offers insights about food and products that otherwise would remain unknown. If Fooducate does not have a product in its database one can email photos of the product, nutritional info and ingredients to be reviewed and added. My complaint is that Fooducate evaluates foods differently, i.e. suggests eating frozen fruits and vegetables because these products are frozen at peak freshness but I'd rather not have frozen preservatives and prefer to stay away from freezer foods. App holds different dietary values but is still very useful.

This app is so great! It's very eye opening. If you are trying to lose weight it's awesome because you can track everything. It gives you points based on your goals your weight and your height not just a general system. If a product isn't on their app you take a picture and send it to their team and they will search all of the info and add it. It's amazing how many foods are GMO! I knew it was a problem but not until now did I know just how huge it was. My 8yr old scans food at the store and it's fun for her to choose healthy safe options.

Overall, no complaints! I would recommend this to others

I love this app. It's intuitive and great features, even for the free version. My favorite is the recipes feature where you can add your own recipe and it calculates the amount of calories per serving. I just wish it had a feature to suggest the amount per serving and how many servings based on the total ingredients. I also like being able to create meals for the most common things I eat. Finally, I would like to suggest an "edit" feature for recipes and such for when we forget to add a photo or find a new thing to do with the recipe.

The food database in this has a real potential to become huge!  I have scanned pretty much everything in my fridge and I have to say I'm shocked and some of the results I have gotten.  But the app does have it's limitations.  There's a lot of foods that I have that really aren't in the database but I LOVE that three quick pictures and they know all about it.  It will take some time to be added to the database of course but they've made it easy to help the database just grow larger and larger!  Awesome app, keep up the good work!

I really love the nutritional information too. The charts are amazing and a great graphical depiction of my effort and progress.

I like this app for a bunch of reasons. Briefly, if you contact support, THEY ANSWER! Not always the case with app developers. I especially like the fact that it seems to be an unbiased analysis of both processed and unprocessed foods. With "health" apps, this is not always the case. It doesn't automatically vilify processed foods which is rare these days or so it seems to me. Just the facts as they see them. Good scanning of barcodes and a seemingly broad database of foods. I enjoy the look and feel as well. Good job.

I have been a health nut for years now and this app is hands-down the best one I've ever come across. I've had my plate, and my fitness pal, but this one really goes above and beyond. Very user-friendly, tells you facts about the food you would not be able to find out unless you truly looked into it, and also keeps track of the amount of processed food, and the nutrients break down beyond just macros. It's free to download but if you're willing to invest $30 for the entire year you can unlock so many amazing features.
