Title: DOWNLOADERS BEWARE! Sounds like a good idea except the app doesn’t work
----------------------------------------------------------
I am gluten sensitive and have to avoid foods that contain gluten. I have been in desperate search for food scanner apps that help weed out diet restrictions and this app came up. I love the idea that this app will help because gluten takes forms in many ingredients and it’s hard to remember each ingredient or have to search it up while food shopping. However, upon installing the app it’s been giving me a hard time setting up an account and loading each screen on the app! Navigating through each screen and on each page the app is malfunctioning and there’s a pop up saying “Error! Something went wrong” ... what is this madness?! I have deleted the app, restarted my phone and reinstalled, still nothing. It’s being downloaded over strong WiFi, so I know connection isn’t the issue. However this is very disappointing to the point that I had to write a review and let the developers know there is a serious bug and it needs to be fixed, my review won’t be changed until then, when I can get the full experience of the app.

Title: Shop well app is bogus
----------------------------------------------------------
This app grades food products, that are full of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), as having high scores and a good choice for you to buy.  BEWARE!  Be informed! Those same companies, that make the products this app grades as great choices, are the ones that support Monsanto and have donated millions to help fight against their products being labeled as containing GMOs.  This app is junk.  Stay away.  Boycott products that have GMOs and the companies that donate money to keep GMO labeling off products.  Download the app Buycott instead to scan which products you should support or avoid.  Its all about money people. Take a stand.  It is cheaper to have GMOs and labeling as having GMOs takes away from their profit margins.  Do your homework.  The offending companies won't do it for you.  Study up on GMOs, Monsanto, prop 37, non-gmo project, etc.

Title: Read this!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is a good idea but they need to re-do it. There are many things terribly wrong. For example, if an item has added sugar it is docked points. This is good but they dock it the same amount if it has 20 g added sugar or if it has 1 g added sugar. There are cereals with 15 g sugar that are rated better than similar cereals with 5 g sugar because they have a little more iron. This app also does not take into account calories or portion size. There are veggie burgers with 300 calories and 15 g protein rated higher than veggie burgers with 100 calories and 10 g protein. This doesn't make sense. I have found numerous examples like this. I hope no one is basing what they eat on this app!

Title: Can I trust it?
----------------------------------------------------------
It is a stellar concept but less than satisfactory execution. It seems that if it is not a major brand it’s not listed and if it is listed the major brand gets a better rating. I scanned some juice that had no additives it was rated very much lower than a major brand with more additives than you can shack a stick at. Than sativa is an artificial sweetener. Really! That brings the whole app into question. What else do they have wrong. In my opinion I can’t trust the app to give me good information, therefor it is of limited use. Hopefully I will be able to trust it sometime in the future.

Title: Ok
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is ok.  It needs way more in its database.  Things I know for sure/ have the words written on it that the product is Gluten Free... Does not come up.  Tried scanning most things in my kitchen as for we just switched over to Gluten Free food because of my sons recent diagnosis for Celiac and nothing is came up.  I don't know if because the products are off brands and not popular General Mills or pillsbury products.  But I would hope that they would have all the off brands Gluten free products (ex Cup4cup flour... carried at William Sonoma) listed. Good thing this app is free!

Title: Unreliable for gluten free foods
----------------------------------------------------------
If you must avoid wheat gluten, it's all or nothing. So what am I supposed to think of a product rating that is less than a 100 percent match for the search term "gluten" and a sole profile of "gluten-free"? A product either has gluten (NOT acceptable in ANY quantity for those with celiac disease) or it does not. Expensive processed packaged "health" foods dominate the lists. We don't all live in sophisticated cities where grocery stores have aisles and aisles of this stuff. In summary, app is useless if you need to avoid wheat gluten.

Title: Useless
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded this to help me as I was starting my gluten free diet to treat my severe migraines. Everything I scanned was a bad match, even foods that I ended up looking up on my own that were completely safe with absolutely no gluten. The other foods it didn't have in its database, which were common, brand name foods. It either gave me the wrong answer or no answer at all. I would not recommend this app to anyone. It was a waste of time to me when I really needed help during such a drastic lifestyle change.

Title: I use to love this app but ....
----------------------------------------------------------
I have Celiacs Disease and this app has been great. However, 2 months ago, both my husband and my app on our phones stopped working. Had to uninstall and reinstall twice, on each phone. It stopped working again, at a store, very frustrating. Now once again it has stopped working again. I uninstalled, reinstalled again, now it won’t recognize my username and password. An app shouldn’t be this frustrating to use. I’m in IT, and I’m so frustrated by using this app right now. I’m 99% over it at this point.

Title: To be seen
----------------------------------------------------------
I absolutely love this app I use it every time I go shopping. However I gave this app 1 star so hopefully this comment will be seen. Most of the time while shopping I try to be reasonable and look at both store brand and non-name brand items. I was a little disappointed to see that the brand Kroger was nowhere to be found on this app along with grocery stores just as King Soopers brand. I hope to see these brands and many more soon. And when it happens I will definitely give the app five stars.

I loved this app when I first got it.   I used it all the time.  Since I've updated it I can no longer use it.   I've tried to set up a login account an it won't go beyond the screen that ask if I'm male or female the number of people I shop for and my age.   Not sure why that I for is important.  As of now I consider this app worthless and wouldn't recommend it until it's made more user friendly.  I don't have time to stand in the store and input info in order check the label.

Title: Useless!
----------------------------------------------------------
I can read the labels of all the foods I buy at my local grocery store and decide whether I can eat it or not. The problem with this app is that a lot of the items chosen for your specific diet are bought at which local grocery store? It doesn't tell you that! I highly doubt that your grocery list made by this app will be easily found at your favorite grocery store. So are you supposed to run around town to find where each specialty item is located? Not helpful in my eyes.

Title: Gave wrong information
----------------------------------------------------------
I was excited when I found this app, but then the very first product that I scanned (vanilla coke) came up saying that it contained gluten, I found this strange, because previous research told me that it did not, so I contacted the company to find out that it in fact does not contain gluten. I guess there is no point in using this app if it is going to give me the wrong. Information on such an important allergy, who knows what other foods it will get wrong?

Title: Great idea but...
----------------------------------------------------------
As I absolutely love this app. However I find it useless and I'm grateful that I didn't pay for it. 96% of everything that I look up is not in the database. If you simply buy really mass-produced goods, basic brands that you find at you're mainstream grocery stores this is a good application, but if you shop at Whole Foods, healthier places, use healthier brands, or organic this would not work for you. Which is too bad I liked everything else about it.

Title: Get it if you want to turn your phone into a snob that judges you
----------------------------------------------------------
It automatically assumes I care about a tiny amount of added sugar and that I'd literally rather have everything be organic.  I set it to only check for gluten and it is telling me that spaghetti sauce is a medium match for me only based on sodium and it doesn't say anything about gluten and then suggests other stuff that is way worse in other aspects like fat and saturated fat.  Go for it if you're a cuckolded hipster.

Title: Terrible - DO NOT USE if you have CELIAC
----------------------------------------------------------
This app labels products as okay to eat even if they are labelled processed in a facility that also manufactures wheat. Many products may also contain gluten even if they are not labelled. For people with Celiac disease, this is too serious an issue to rely on this app, and more investigation is required to ensure the sources of ingredients are safe and there is no cross contamination.

Title: Do NOT trust gluten results, GLUTEN RESULTS NOT ACCURATE
----------------------------------------------------------
It only looks for listed label allergen warnings. Milky Way, for instance, says it's a weak match & safe because it doesn't list wheat but it DOES CONTAIN MALTED BARLEY. Barley contains GLUTEN-wheat-rye-barley... can't have any of those if you're allergic to gluten. I have Celiac Disease & this app is VERY UNSAFE!!!

----------------------------------------------------------
I can't trust this app to help with my food allergies. I started off with my soy allergy then went to the soy category to check the results. To my surprise it was a long list of highly recommended foods, none of which I can eat. If it does not track and categorize foods, I'm not sure what it does at all.

I shop at Aldi, and the scanner on the app doesn't recognize a single food item. If they incorporate Aldi store brands, then this app would be great.

I intentionally scanned almond milk that said no dairy, no soy and no gluten but yet the app says that there is soy in it. Not a trustworthy app.

First, 4 out of 5 reads, it doesn't find the product. When it does, it sends you ads related to the search. Info provided not specific enough.

Does not filter well based on user wishes.  All I wanted was gluten information.  I got ratings based on fat/sugar.  I did not ask for that.
