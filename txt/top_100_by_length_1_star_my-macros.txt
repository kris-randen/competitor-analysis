Title: PLEASE READ!!! (Missing important components)
----------------------------------------------------------
Doesn't track anything besides calories, carbs, sugar, fiber, fats, protein, sodium, and cholesterol. I was looking for a nutritional app with vitamins and minerals, etc. A lot of health problems develop because of nutritional deficiencies and the limited nutritional data on this app is disappointing. I intended on tracking a wide variety of nutritional aspects of my diet but am unable to with this app, in its current state. I suggest the developers to add all the nutritional data of all foods to this app. Also, I suggest possibly consulting with nutritionalists and dietitians to add accurate nutritional information on the function/importance/risk associated with various nutritional data such as vitamins, minerals, fats, protein, etc. Also, how excess and deficiencies in personal nutritional aspects may effect health. Nutrition does not just effect physical attributes but it also significantly effects emotional attributes such as depression. This app is currently a tool to track limited data but it has the potential to become an education device that could potential help people manage and understand their own complicated health/nutritional needs. This would help people track and develop their nutritional diet to improve physically AND mentally. With the solid support base this app currently has, I feel like a lot of people could benefit from these changes which is why I hope the developer reads this. Peace.

Title: I HATE this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using this app at the recommendation of my personal trainer. I have used myfitnesspal and the Fitbit food tracker in the past and wasn‚Äôt particularly pleased with either of them, but this app is unbelievably, frustratingly worse - and it isn‚Äôt free! I thought the barcode scanner would be a nice touch, but even if it can find my food, it never accurately depicts what‚Äôs on the label, so I end up having to manually enter everything anyway. And the food database is painstakingly small, even when you create an account and pay for the app. I also hate that unlike myfitnesspal and the Fitbit tracker, you can‚Äôt change the measuring unit, and nearly everything ends up in grams. Unless you have a food scale handy literally all the time, you can‚Äôt estimate how much you‚Äôre eating when you have to measure in grams. And the personalized macro goals the app created for me - which are supposedly the reason why this app is so heralded - were so unattainable, even at the least aggressive setting (e.g. 200 grams of protein per day - I‚Äôm not a bodybuilder!) that I ended up setting my own anyway. Do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt waste your money on this garbage app.

Title: General letdown: rating is due to age
----------------------------------------------------------
As most reviews will tell you; this app is a general letdown. It is inflexible in portion selection, it requires you to pay a monthly fee for basic TDEE calculations, the scanner and label reader barely work, and BY GOD is the search awful. I mean, there is literally NO natural language parsing. Let‚Äôs say in MFP or MyNetDiary you want to search for some food from some brand. You‚Äôd type in ‚Äúnuggets McDonald‚Äôs‚Äù and probably get Chicken McNugget as one of the top results. Assuming you had the foresight to type in the proper, exact name of what you want in this app. You can only search the food, then use an antiquated list to navigate poorly to which brand you might want. Even the universal search is pathetic. Worst of all: the support is terrible. I had a log in issue that prevented me from using the app again, which thankfully led me to MyNetDiary in the interim. It took 2 weeks and multiple check ins on my behalf just to get the log in issue resolved. This should have been a 2-3 business day issue at most. Look elsewhere. They keep the old reviews up because they‚Äôre from a time when this actually was one of the better macro apps.

Title: Needs to integrate with Apple
----------------------------------------------------------
When it integrates with my Apple Watch, I‚Äôll give it a 5.  This is THE most INEFFICENT set of tracking/exercise apps I have ever used.  I had them once.  Hated them.  Signed up with a Macros Inc coach and tried them again since that‚Äôs what they prefer.  Logging water shouldn‚Äôt take that many steps.  Logging food is somewhat easy, but not any easier than MFP.  The workout app is incredibly annoying.  It seems like it would be so handy, but really it takes so much time.  HOW in this day in age does it NOT integrate with the Apple Watch?  HOW?!  It won‚Äôt let you put in your own calories. You have to ‚Äúrate‚Äù your exercise and try and make it match the calories burned.  I have spent hours of my life the past few days getting these apps preset for logging and such, but wow.  Not something to easily stick to.  I have a free membership to Pro with my Macros Inc membership, but I you couldn‚Äôt pay me to use this terrible app combo.  My Fitness Pal all the way.  Get with the program MM.

Title: So far it's the pits
----------------------------------------------------------
Let me preface this by stating I have never submitted a review, ever! I purchased in order to track macros directly through Avatar and I am so disappointed. The interface is far from user friendly, searches render vast results with nothing to contribute towards what you are actually searching for. I expected to see where I am in my macros to get an idea of where I am and nothing. MFP is superior in this aspect. I believe people are looking for simplicity when it comes to figuring out tracking which is why they sign up for Avatar. Maybe you should take note and not give everyone fatigue in manually entering their foods, I mean looking up coconut oil produced ZERO results for oil but tons for mass produced products with coconut in them. This is a FAIL! The explanation provided by Avatar sold me on something you just don't supply. Please add a screen so we can see the tracking from the info provided once you link the accounts.

Title: Very complicated and frustrating to use..
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm coming from MyFitnessPal, I was a long time user of theirs but I kept hearing a lot of great things about My Macro+ so decided to give it shot.  First off, this app is extremely frustrating to use, the app has the ability to scan  barcodes, scan nutritional labels but it is usually a hit or miss with more if not all of the labels I have scanned... so guess what that means? You have to spend more time inputting the whole label for the foods you ate.  The app claims that it has over 5,000,0000 codes in its food database that should pick up when you scan an item, but since I‚Äôve gotten the app it can‚Äôt even pick up some of the most common brands out there.  Secondly, you already pay 2.99 for the app, the application doesn‚Äôt give you the ability to track your macros such as Proteins, Fats and carbs for free, this is a paid feature of the application which makes the application completely useless to me.

Title: Grossly Overrated
----------------------------------------------------------
This app came highly recommended. I was looking for something to replace MFP that let me get better customization of my macros. I can‚Äôt believe I paid for this app that has almost zero functionality. Great I can customize my macros down to the each‚Äôs, but I have to enter EVERYTHING else. The barcode scanner works, but almost all of the information was entered incorrectly. The nutrition label scanner almost never works, yet I keep trying. Most recently it told me my creamer was 2 calories but 80 grams of fat ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôve learned not to even open the database, because google is more accurate if I‚Äôm really unsure. And the worst is despite entering something as one serving, when you go to quickly add it to your day, the default is one of whatever the measurement is. Enter one serving as 15g, but quick add will default to one gram. It‚Äôs super frustrating and makes me miss the free MFP. Save your money.

Title: Used to be a good lapp.
----------------------------------------------------------
I haven't really worried about tracking my macros in a while and the last time I did I used those app. It was great. So, getting back in the habit of tracking my macros I downloaded it again. This go around however, the app has gotten horrible. I don't mean the interface necessarily, just that its food data and basic math are atrocious. First off it can't accurately give me the macros for baked boneless, skinless chicken breast... I tried to modify the data to match every other source out there but it wouldn't work. As far as basic math skills, I put the exact same items in for my breakfast, scanning a few barcodes that didn't result in the correct data, ( which I was able to change to match the items label), then the total for my breakfast ended up being like 15 calories higher than in actuality. This version of the app terrible so back to MyFitnessPal.

Title: Frustrating
----------------------------------------------------------
I like the app but it has dumb issues. The food database is confusing to sort through and contains random brand junk food but not quality brand food from Whole Foods. The portions are a mess. It‚Äôs such a pain to use that I have to customize all my food. What idiotic programming. I can‚Äôt even search for a banana. I keep coming back to this app since I bought it but I think I‚Äôll abandon it if there is a better app out there which there sure may be by now since I got this 4 years ago. Also I have to shot the app down completely to get it to reset to a new day. If you search for a lemon it will first give you results you dint want such as 30 versions of 1 gram. It will never give you calories of a lemon. Instead it will give you results to lemon pie. Terrible food database. Terrible the worst on the AppStore.

Title: Tutorial videos are no help
----------------------------------------------------------
I purchased this app to help me track my macros hoping that it was going to be easy to do so. I have watched the tutorials to show me how to log my meals, then I go to log them and it only allows me to log one meal per day. The tutorials are terrible and don‚Äôt show or explain you how to continue to add the next meals for the same day. I was only able to log my breakfast and track my water. What a waste of $2.99. Now I have to figure out how to cancel the 7 day free trial for the pro version I signed up before I get charged another $19.99. I‚Äôm still working on this too. If I follow the tutorial on canceling my account, it is futile and I get no where. I‚Äôll be upgrading My Fit Pal app instead, it‚Äôs much easier to navigate and they don‚Äôt charge to just download the app like My Macros + does.

Title: Potential but misses on most marks!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Like other users here, I was a Myfitnesspal user and wanted something more in depth. While setting everything up I thought I made the right choice until I started using the food tracker. Like everyone here, the barcode was good for me but barely worked for my Wife‚Äôs phone. As I tried to input serving size data, NONE of the information matched. The more I edited it the more the calculations were wrong. I tried putting in serving sizes like cups, ounces, etc. and it was like it didn‚Äôt know how to compute it. Then, I put it down after frustration, closed it out and tried again the following day with the exact same results and even worse, it wasn‚Äôt even saving to my food log. In short, waste of money and time. Myfitnesspal is free and better on all accounts.

Title: Completely inaccurate data makes this useless
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is great, in theory. It has a lot of potential and is designed nicely. However, it is fundamentally unusable. When using the barcode scanner feature to log food, almost everything is inaccurate. I would estimate that 9/10 items I scanned were entirely wrong. In addition, the units were often incorrect or nonsensical. If you try to search for items (even items that are clearly in the database, based on the inaccurate barcode scans), it shows no results. The entire purpose of this app is to help people accurately track their food consumption. Without accurate data, it is essentially useless. I tried to get a refund, since the app doesn‚Äôt work as advertised, and it was denied. Very disappointing app and customer service.

Title: Looks nice but not as functional as I would like
----------------------------------------------------------
The food database is very strange. If I want to look up a certain brand of something, it shows SO many unrelated things. For example, Stonefire Naan Dippers (like small pita wedges, resulted in apple dippers, chicken dippers, etc. Even using the option to narrow it down by brand didn‚Äôt work because the brand was spelled incorrectly. Search parameters that contain only what you enter would be helpful as I‚Äôve never had this issue with any other food database in any other app. Further, it doesn‚Äôt let you change the type of serving. For example, angel hair pasta was something like a 3 inch long 2 diameter portion. You should be able to switch to ounces or something you can measure out after cooking.

Title: Not satisfied!
----------------------------------------------------------
I switched to this app from MFP at the recommendation of several people. They said its great! Its better than MFP and can do everything MFP can do it just tracks macros instead of calories.  I researched and eventually downloaded it only to find that I can't track a lot of my food in quantaties I want such as ounces and it doesn't have the database MFP does! I can't even track my exercise! MFP can link with Runkeeper, MapMyRun, Fitbit and many more but in order for me to track my fitness I would have to spend another $1.99 to get the exercise app that goes with this food tracking app.  Needless to say this lasted less than 3 days and I am back to my happy place using MFP. Waste of $3.

Title: Terrible search results
----------------------------------------------------------
This App could be great for tracking macros but the search results make you want to give up on life. It makes me more frustrated than an Amish electrician. The search results have almost no connection to what was searched. Don't pay for the app. Stick with MFP. For more specifics, I searched for a "Maple Bacon Donut" (a fairly common donut) only to see results for maple bacon. I decided to search for "Maple Donut" an even more common donut especially from Dunkin Donuts to see no results of it but a bunch of peanut butter results that had hardly any correlation. I then went in MFP and searched for "Maple Bacon Donut" and guess what?! The results came up for Maple Bacon Donuts!

Title: Broken and Worthless App
----------------------------------------------------------
Well designed app but it is frustrating to use. Want to log your Dorito chip intake? The only logging option is per single chip. How does one add up all the broken pieces? The bar code scanner quit working. When it was working the bar code scanner did not recognize many common foods. Logging quantity of food intake is about worthless because common units are usually missing as an input. Want to add a banana? The logging unit is one cup mashed. Why no grams or ounces - you know, typical units of kitchen scales. Do not waste your money on this app unless you want to spend all your time working out unit conversions and searching the internet for nutrition data information.

Title: Not Worth The Money
----------------------------------------------------------
There are better apps out there, and after paying $2.99, they want more, anywhere from $1.99 a month to $9.99 a month, for what you really need to count your macros. It‚Äôs just stupid now. You pay $2.99 for what is a very basic app, which does absolutely nothing worthwhile, when you really need to be paying $1.99 a month to be able to actually count macros. This developer really needs to offer a free 30 day trial of what is really a subscription based service...but they won‚Äôt, because they know this. There are much better apps out there, and even the free version of My Fitness Pal is better. The developers need to do MUCH better than this.

Title: Most foods are inaccurate!
----------------------------------------------------------
I really wanted to love this app but every time i scan a barcode i have to edit the nutrition! and i even purchased the monthly premium. honestly the only one i haven‚Äôt had to edit is a banana. Also it‚Äôs so difficult to find a simple food when i search for it. I‚Äôll type in ‚Äúhoney‚Äù in the search bar and  the most random things pop up like ‚Äúhoney wheat bread‚Äù  or cereals etc. i switched over from MFP because i just wanted to have a different mind sent, but i can see why they are rated far above this one. I will give this one a star because of the layouts simplicity, but overall i would have rather used the 4$ on a cheap lipgloss

Title: Database is Non Existent
----------------------------------------------------------
I signed up for MM+ only because I‚Äôm working with a coach who syncs to it. I‚Äôve used MFP and LoseIt and MM+ by far has the worse database of all the apps. For example, I tried searching for an English muffin this morning and one from a restaurant came up. It is easy to scan your food but if you‚Äôre searching for a fresh food or an item off a menu be totally prepared to input it manually. The interface is nice graphically but the $19 premium is NOT worth it as nothing loads and works online. But really for me, ease of use and ability to track quickly are key and the lack of foods in the database makes this app horrible.

Okay I know the overall rating is really great because that‚Äôs what got me into buying this. But trust me, don‚Äôt buy it unless you have a lot of patience and a lot of free time. It takes a very long time to add food, adjust serving size, change units, etc. Most of the time you can‚Äôt even be positive it‚Äôs correct because food is measured in grams, and I‚Äôm obviously unable to carry a scale around with me everywhere I go. Even at home I‚Äôm not weighing my burger/salad/pasta/avocados. It‚Äôs not user friendly and way over complicated. I feel like it would be easier to just keep a hand written log instead of buying this.

Title: Big step backwards!
----------------------------------------------------------
Latest version includes interface changes that degrade usability. For starters, the food item name and amount are now on the same line with very little room for the amount. So if the amount is more than a few characters, the only way to read it is to open the food edit screen which at least has a "Back" button to cancel. Most other screens force you to swipe down. If you're aim is off you end up in the iPhone Notification Center. I could go on -- especially the bad changes on the weight screen -- but the bottom line is nearly every cosmetic change in the version makes it harder to use. Please change it back!

Title: Great concept poorly executed
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is such a disappointment. The food base is way to large and wildly in accurate. If you want to change the measurement it takes forever, if you scan using the bar code the information doesn‚Äôt match the nutrition label. The food library is as over crowded as MFP, no generics from a USDA food database. If you search banana there will be 60 options all vastly different and each in a different measurement. Editing anything is slow and glitchy. Overall this is a great concept with great features but the app is slow and not user friendly. Inputting food takes way too long.

----------------------------------------------------------
Once again, I hope for an app that thinks globally.  This is not it. I downloaded and paid 2.99 for that privilege, immediately discovered I had to pay lord to get any of the advertised data.  On top of that, the first 4 barcodes I scanned were not in the database. I can only assume it is because I don‚Äôt live in the US and the database doesn‚Äôt contain international foods. I understand that I can add foods of my choice, but I don‚Äôt have time to do that.  I will have to return to MyFitnessPal-still free, still well populated with many foods. Please give me back my 2.99 USD.

I cannot believe this app has 4 and a half stars. I don't even know where to begin. First of all, the food database is absolutely horrific; it is missing some of the most common brand name foods and furthermore, 95% of the foods have either the wrong name, brand, or both. The worst part is, the nutritional information on the food that is in the database is all over the place. As if that wasn't bad enough, the interface is absolutely horrible and has no organization anywhere in the app. This app is seriously a scam and I can't believe I really spent 3 bucks on it.

Every food I've searched for or scanned in has incorrect numbers. The calories and the macros are consistently incorrect. I've fact checked online or by using the nutritional information on the product. I had high hopes for this app since myfitnesspal is now charging monthly. Everything else about the app is good, but with incorrect information it's pretty much useless. You can edit the information to make it correct, but it's too time consuming. Don't spend your money on this app until they fix the database. I'm surprised that this app has such good reviews.

----------------------------------------------------------
Database is empty for the most part. I do like that it is cheaper than MFP. Custom macros and day-to-day goals is a winner for me. You have to pay $49.99 a year on MFP to do that. Fix y‚Äôalls database and add more options of how much of something you consume (ex. 1 cup, 1/3 cup, 1TSP of milk rather than just a 1 cup option). If you used 3TSP of milk for a recipe, you‚Äôd have to manually compute how many cups 3TSP is. This will save consumers a lot of work, which is the whole point of an app like this. It should be stress free and easy, yet this is the opposite.

I‚Äôve used this app for only a few days, but am too frustrated to continue. It‚Äôs not user friendly (very confusing how to navigate through the app), but I can get past that. The final straw is the actual tracker. When scanning items to add to my tracker, I tried to change the serving sizes (1 gram of butter is minuscule) and it won‚Äôt adjust the fat, carbs and protein for the new serving size. I have no idea what I‚Äôm actually tracking and how I‚Äôve ended the day. Wish I didn‚Äôt spend $3 on this app. Waste of money, especially compared to all of the free options.

----------------------------------------------------------
Started counting my macros with MyFitnessPal. Worked great because it had any food imagined at a 1 oz measurable. Although on MFP you couldn't select an exact macro goal you still could keep track by looking at our goal detains. On this app the first foods I looked for for meal 1 didn't even find anything. 1 oz of grilled steak brings up different steak servings from various restaurants. Same for over easy egg or anything I searched for. This app isn't worth the money. I'll stick to using MyFitnessPal. Don't waste your money.

----------------------------------------------------------
Not only did I have to pay for the app, but to just set my macros I have to sign up for a monthly subscription just to make sure my days macros are within my goals. I get subscriptions that enhance and give extra features, but just setting a baseline macro for a macro app should be included, especially if you have to pay for the app. Also the good nutrition stored in this app is very poor and some of the items aren‚Äôt even in there, like raw tomatoes. Unless your talking about anything from a restaurant, it‚Äôs not in there.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi TheBwii29, really sorry for the confusion but you can set your macro goals for no extra charge than just the paid app price. Go to the "Set Nutritional Goals" settings page and hit "Add Goal Profile". Then you can enter in your macro goals in grams, no extra subscription required.

Title: Calories won‚Äôt work
----------------------------------------------------------
I tried to submit a custom food that was 641 calories. This is normal because I usually add a lot of custom foods to this app. The app decides to lower the calories to 423 no matter what I try. I try to update how many calories are in the food and the app doesn‚Äôt change a thing about the meal when I‚Äôm done updating. I‚Äôve made sure I‚Äôve clicked update food when I‚Äôm don‚Äôt but nothing works. This is a rule breaker for me and I‚Äôll have to switch to MyFitnessPal if the issue persists. Can I get some help on this situation?

----------------------------------------------------------
I have both the app and the website subscription. None of the features work. None of my custom foods show up to be entered as ingredients for my recipes. None of my recipes I entered on the website show up at all after trying to sync the app. When I search for ingredients for my recipes, there are like 40 duplicate entries and you have to scroll forever only to see that the food you are looking for isn‚Äôt even there. Still waiting to hear back from customer service about all of this...What an effing waste of money.

----------------------------------------------------------
Don't waste your money. $2.99 just to download their 'free' edition (you get most of these options with free apps out there). This app touts analysis and graphs to map your meal progress. NOPE, you want that, be prepared to fork over $20 per year. Completely misleading description and pictures. I was mainly interested in the Macro tracking and reporting. I find it hard having to manually enter foods I've ate or drinks I've consumed. It's a waste of time and money. MFP works better than this app. Save your money.

Title: DONT BUY unless you want to enter everything in manually
----------------------------------------------------------
I purchased this with the hope that since it was designed by a fitness professional the nutritional information would be better than that found in other apps. I was therefore greatly disappointed when the app failed to recognize four out of the five items I had for breakfast. I don‚Äôt eat anything special; yogurt and berries with some flax seeds and almond milk. I purchased this app because I have little time to enter these items individually. Save your money, just use My Fitness Pal or other similar apps.

----------------------------------------------------------
I bought this app to replace MyFitnessPal so that I could get more detailed nutritional info. After reading many positive reviews and seeing that they had so many foods loaded in I tried it out. What a waste of money. MFP has virtually every food I plugged in, not so here where less than half of the foods I looked up were either not listed or not listed in the size I used. I started plugging in the data from MFP and then realized what a waste of time that was and filed the app. Hugely disappointing.

----------------------------------------------------------
Just night the app. And EXTREMELY disappointed so far. Not a single item that the barcode scanner has scanned as accurate information! The name and brands of the food work. But calories, protein, carbs, sodium, everything is off. It was saying my turkey meat had 2 grams less protein, 30 fewer calories, and 1 carb less than actual packaging states. Very upsetting for someone trying to really make lifestyle change and can't even trust the app for accurate numbers. I hope this is fixed very soon.

----------------------------------------------------------
App is not capable of basic math. Bar code function only works sometimes. You can scan a bar code and even if the item I‚Äôd found it may have zero nutritional values included. I thought that was reasonable, but custom entries don‚Äôt calculate correctly either. For example, I created a custom entry that had 240 calories, 20 g of carb and 12 g of sugar. When I applied the item it calculated it at 80 cal, 20 carb and 12 sugar. I capfuls track better with an Excel spreadsheet. Don‚Äôt waste your $2.99

Use a free site to determine your macros needs and use MyFitnessPal. This app is so annoying and clunky to use. You're constantly have to change the amount of food because it defaults to 1 gram or 1 Cubans it's hard to make changes to that unlike MyFitnessPal (which also tells you your macros in the free version). I really don't see any benefit at all in using this app. It also doesn't have the amount of foods MyFitnessPal has. I've never had to search so much!! What a huge waste of time.

They advertise the MyMacros+ app as swipe and done.  Wrong, Wrong Wrong.....  Just try to find "raw ginger". Not there.  You will look thru hundreds of entries (ginger ale, ginger beer, ginger candy) but no raw ginger.  Or, try to find "raw carrot".  Again, you will look thru maybe thousands of entries for carrot cake, carrot bread, before you find just plain raw carrot.  Its mind numbing and wasteful of my time.  Especially for an app I pay for and pay the additional monthly fee.

I've been trying to switch to this app but it's just not working. Trying to find foods is a complete 'scratch-your-face-off' nightmare. I have the global search on but finding something as simple as "nectarines" was nearly impossible. We also eat a lot of organic foods and no matter what I type after "organic" the first option is a tomato basil sauce. I'm so frustrated that I've been using my previous app (mynetdiary) to get my food totals and THEN entering it here.

----------------------------------------------------------
I regret purchasing this app for sure. I've been using My Fitness Pal for the longest time, but wanted to set macro goals in grams rather than percents. My Macros + allows you to do that. However, the search engine is terrible. It's hard to find the exact food you are looking for. Even with the barcode scanner, I wasn't able to find nutrition data for many foods I wanted to log. It's far too time consuming to do this manually. The database in mfp is so much better.

The worst app for counting macros. Barcodes hardly ever scan and when they do it can't find the food or finds it with wrong macro information that's way off from the nutrition label. The search function is equally useless. Example: if I enter "apple" you would think the first thing would be info for an average size apple but I stead it returns crap like "applebees apple pie fritter desert" or some such nonsense. Look for another app, this one is worthless.

The bar code scanner barely works. Lots of issues with crashing and freezing. Very very disappointed in this purchase. Will be looking for something else to use.

Title: Cash grab
----------------------------------------------------------
After paying $4 for this app, the first thing that happens when I open it up is the app hits me up for more money.  It wants a $10/month subscription to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù all the features that I thought I had already paid for when I bought the app.  DEFINITELY save your money.  To spend $4 just for the privilege of paying $120/year is unacceptable.

Title: Won‚Äôt even allow me to log in!
----------------------------------------------------------
Heard a lot of good things about the macro tracking and figured it was worth the 2.99. WRONG! If you create an account from their website, good luck getting the app to login to that account. I had to reset my password multiple times only to come to a conclusion that it‚Äôs just not going to work. Hopefully apple will refund me for a dud!

Title: Unnecessary to buy
----------------------------------------------------------
The app alone doesn‚Äôt do anything any of the free macro trackers do, so for those that do not want to spend money to get the app and then 9.99 for a subscription for added use, I do not recommend. I would recommend Lose It for those that don‚Äôt want to spend money on a calorie counter but you have to do a subscription for macro tracking

Title: Seems OK but not what I needed
----------------------------------------------------------
I didn‚Äôt appreciate you sending me at for y‚Äôall your spam nonsense  This is very tedious you have to enter in each individual thing I was looking for something that actually calculated percentages if you give a certain amount of calories so you can figure out what percentage of fat carbs and protein you need this app does not do that

Title: Horrible database
----------------------------------------------------------
Calorie tracking shouldn't mean not being able to track major restaurants.  The database has almost no restaurant or fast food places in it. Sometimes I need that. So now to make the other positives about this work I still need MFP to look up my foods.  I'd give it 3 stars for the positives but since it was a waste of $3 I gave it 1.

Title: Could be a lot better
----------------------------------------------------------
No way to set a goal. I want to set my ideals macros so as I eat through the day I can see how I'm doing against the goal. It's not asking for much, no idea why this wouldn't have something like that. Food selections are poor, I've had to create customs for almost everything. On to find a better app. A shame I had to pay for this.

----------------------------------------------------------
Paying $3 for an app with a barcode scanner is great and all, if the scanner actually worked! I have to change EVERY one of the numbers EVERY time I scan something. What a joke. And you charge $10 a month just so I can plug in my information to see if I‚Äôm going over in macros or not. Really wish I hadn‚Äôt purchased the app now.

----------------------------------------------------------
Don‚Äôt waste the money! I also use MFP and wanted better macro tracking. I (stupidly) assumes that paying for an app unlocked all the features. You have to pay $19.99/year plus $9.99/month to get the ‚Äúextra‚Äù features that made this app so appealing in the first place. I should‚Äôve read more negative reviews before purchasing!

Title: Not user friendly
----------------------------------------------------------
I found this app a bit confusing and for having to pay for it I didn‚Äôt feel like it offered very many options. There are other apps on the market that are free to do the same thing this one does. Maybe it‚Äôs great for their clients and integrated with both of their apps but I definitely found my $2.99 to be a waste of money

Title: Wildly disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought this app because I wanted to sync it with Avatar Nutrition.  I went out of my way to like it (scanning foods and manually entering information) and it just doesn't come anywhere close to MyFitnessPal.  I went ahead and bought MFP's premium subscription and its head and shoulders above MM+ in terms of usability.

Title: Difficult to Use
----------------------------------------------------------
First and foremost, I absolutely WANT to like this app. I‚Äôve been a long time user of MyFitnessPal (which does most of what I want very well) but I absolutely refuse to pay them $50/year just to adjust my macros at fiber increments than 5% at a time. When I heard about this app from IIFYM, I was stoked and hopeful.

Title: This app is terrible
----------------------------------------------------------
MyMacros+ is probably the least intuitive app I've ever used. Primary actions are hidden 2 and 3 layers deep. Looking up foods is frustrating. Finally, the tool for setting your macro goals just consumes input, it doesn't guide you through any suggestions or help set goals. Truly disappointing. Save your money.

Title: Inaccurate
----------------------------------------------------------
I regret switching over from MFP. Wildly inaccurate! You can‚Äôt even search for something basic like grilled chicken without it displaying all fast food. Scanning a product has displayed all inaccurate info too. Can‚Äôt convert ounces to grams easily without it being wrong. This app is awful and MFP is way better

----------------------------------------------------------
I purchased this app because of the customizable macros. Little did I know that every barcode I scanned is completely unknown. I'm not scanning organic things from Hipster Central. Kellogs corn flakes? Really? It gave me everything but Kellogg's. MyFitnessPal blows this out of the water. Don't waste $2.99

----------------------------------------------------------
I have no problem paying for an app, but this thing is so buggy it barely works. I want to add a recipe and have to do some finagling just to get it to add. I can‚Äôt go online to add it either since I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù subscriber. If I can‚Äôt add stuff via the app I‚Äôm not going to pay more to do it online.

Title: Setting grams for macros
----------------------------------------------------------
I just bought the app and I'm having major trouble actually putting in my exact macros in the app...I literally only bought this app to be able to but in my custom macros. If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated. I'll be extremely upset if I just spent money on this app for no reason at all.

----------------------------------------------------------
There are other apps out there that give you the proper macros once you enter your weight. This app doesn't give you anything, instead you input your own stuff and if you aren't intelligent in the macronutrient world then you'll be lost and probably gain bad weight. MyFitnessPal is much better and free!

MFP does everything this app tries, plus much much more. On top of that it "loses" a lot of the food I input and whenever I have attempted to get technical help they just use canned responses and eventually just stop replying. Pencil and paper are a better option for tracking macros than this app is.

----------------------------------------------------------
I went back to my fitness pal. This app has a horrible data base for food, half the labels I scan it doesn't have, the layout isn't very user friendly. Everything I can use on MFP without paying the fees. This app is a waste of money. Oh and to track your workouts with it you have to buy ANOTHER app.

I bought this app.  Right out of the gate something simple like "scrambled eggs" doesn't exist.  I'm thinking that this app is better for people who eat only packaged goods which I do not.  The database seems lacking. Pass this one buy.  I only bought it bc of avatar and wish I'd read reviews first.

I used this app last year and liked it well enough, but stopped because the barcode scanner stopped working- I tried it again just now, hoping there had been an update fixing the problem (because I want to start tracking macros again), but nope.  Barcode scanner still not functioning.  Disappointed.

I paid $2.99 for the app thinking that was it. When I opened it up, it would not let me go any farther than putting in my information without agreeing to pay $9.99 a month. I‚Äôm so sorry I wasted my $2.99. Don‚Äôt buy this unless you‚Äôre ready to commit to another $9.99 a month. Use a different app!!!!
