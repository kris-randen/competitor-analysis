Title: It‚Äôs pretty but that‚Äôs all...
----------------------------------------------------------
Looking for pregnancy health information and healthy workouts? Don‚Äôt even waste your time downloading this app. Treat yourself to quality free workouts on YouTube and downloading a free pregnancy information app such as Baby Center. If you try this app for free- be prepared to be disappointed. There is only one workout available unless you sign up for the free 7 day trial. The free trial( of course ) leads to automatic monthly debits unless you cancel it in time. The format and information on this app are not worth the price as far as I can tell. App designers- If you really wanted folks to try an app and determine the worth of it, you don‚Äôt make them submit their credit card information to access any of the worthwhile content.

Title: Not worth the $$
----------------------------------------------------------
I have OVIA & What to expect apps, they've been so great. First time mama here. I come across this one & says I have to pay for an upgrade to see the content. It's ridiculous. For you interested consumers & especially for the first time mamas, this app isn't worth the purchase especially if you're trying to save for the baby & all that entails & already going through so much with doctors & your own preparation as a parent. Keep your $$ in your pockets. The information you gain from this app is dull compared to the apps I've mentioned above! I highly recommend OVIA or What to expect! üòÅ

Title: Irritated with this App
----------------------------------------------------------
Wish I hadn‚Äôt purchased. Every time I start the Fitness portion, I get kicked out of the app when my screen goes to rest mode (goes dark) then I have to go back in and restart the fitness program I was already doing. I have to do this multiple times during the workout so I started taking screen shots of the workouts to avoid going back into the app which defeats the purpose of having the app. The app is fully updated on my end. I purchased the 3 month option which I wish I hadn‚Äôt done.  Overall annoyed with this app and would like to get my money back.

Hi there! Over the weekend Google Cloud experienced an outage that impacted a large number of applications and websites (including Youtube, Gmail, and Snapchat), and the Baby2Body app was impacted by this as well - causing trouble accessing all of our videos (therefore the Fitness Studio was largely effected). Google Cloud services have now been fully restored, so the Baby2Body app should be working as normal again. Please email us directly at team@baby2body.com if you're still having trouble and we'll be sure to get this resolved for you right away as we haven't had reports of trouble otherwise!

Title: Rip off!
----------------------------------------------------------
Signed up for a free trial to see what this was like but failed to cancel in time. This app is EXPENSIVE.  I will edit that having it be a one year subscription, at over $100 a year, seems predatory to me. Options for month-to-month memberships or other models for membership would be better, as a persons ability to engage with physical activity during and after pregnancy can change significantly. I am pregnant and busy and exhausted and will now have to go through the App Store maze to figure out how to get my money back.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, we're sorry to hear you missed the cancellation date for your trial, but we don't feel that's fair to culminate into a 1-star review of your app experience. Also, you can very easily contact Apple regarding a refund for any in-app subscriptions purchased through your Apple ID by going to getsupport.apple.com and we would recommend doing that right away, it should be really easy to do so! Also, in response to your addition to your review we do offer a monthly option that you can cancel month to month. Our prices are incredibly on par with other similar applications and even priced below. We understand that is not a comfortable price for everyone and wish you all the best getting in touch with Apple about a refund. You can always contact us at support.baby2body.com and we can give you more tips on how to make sure you get that refund sorted.

Title: Don‚Äôt download free version
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm 6 months pregnant with my first child. I downloaded this app because I haven‚Äôt exercised at all during my pregnancy and wanted safe guided prego workouts and tips that wouldn‚Äôt hurt my baby. Every single article and workout is blocked from the free version. You might as well not even download it if you‚Äôre not going to pay for the unlimited because you can‚Äôt use ANY of the features in this app without paying. It‚Äôs sad because it seems like such a great app but I can‚Äôt afford it.

Title: Unless you buy, you get nothing.
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm not sure who exactly is giving this app such high ratings but there‚Äôs LITERALLY nothing you can do on this app (not read most recipes or articles or do any work out) without buying the premium version, which, btw isn‚Äôt like 4.99 either, they‚Äôre asking 17.99 a month. It‚Äôs ridiculous. It seems like a cool app but it‚Äôs unfair that the only thing you get in the free version is ‚Äúbreathing‚Äù (literally!! That part is free) deleting now!

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there! We're sorry to hear you're not happy that we have a Premium upgrade, but I did want to share everything available on the free app: you get access to all Daily Bites (which include daily updates on baby's growth, two tips for your health and wellbeing every day, motivational quotes, and more). You also get full access to our Timeline feature and Healthy Activity Tracking, which includes the ability to log and track things important to you throughout pregnancy and motherhood, and then check back on your progress. You also get one free workout per week, guided pelvic floor exercises, at least 3 breathing exercises every week and on top of that at least one article specific to your stage of pregnancy. Since our Premium upgrade offers personalized workouts that update each week, weekly recipes and meal plans, and weekly meditations and wellbeing support we do have to charge in order to continue delivering this high-quality content created by Baby2Body experts -- and you will find other workout apps (not personalized to pregnancy and that only provide fitness routines) will charge a similar amount, if not more. With our quarterly plan, the price does come down to $13.99 a month and with our Premium Package, you can get all content for about $7 a month.  Our Premium experience allows us to not use any ads in-app, so everyone (even free users) have an entirely ad-free, safe space to enjoy. We're sorry to hear Baby2Body wasn't right for you but we wish you all the best and good health going forward!

Title: Disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
I am very disappointed with the people who run this app, because I requested a cancellation and refund because I didn‚Äôt know how expensive it was going to be and without ever using the app they canceled my subscription but never gave me my money back. It‚Äôs been a hassle and I still have not heard from them.They charge me $119 and for what the app has it is not worth the money! Beware because if you want out they will not help you

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi Christie, we do believe we responded to your outreach within a few hours of you contacting us and gave instructions on how to get a refund! We haven't heard back from you but we'll send a follow up email in case you didn't see our initial response. To confirm, with your in-app subscription you are being billed by Apple directly through your Apple ID and they manage your subscription entirely so you would have to go through them. Cancelling an Apple ID subscription after you've been charged does not mean you will automatically be refunded, you would have to contact Apple to request a refund! As mentioned, we'll be happy to email directly to best support you with this, I would be sure to check your emails for any outreach from us at support@bab2ybody.com.

Seems like a great app, but I paid for the $12 a month subscription and when I tried to click on the work outs they were still locked. I continued to try to keep buying the subscription thinking maybe it wasn‚Äôt working but it kept saying I was already subscribed??

----------------------------------------------------------
The app appears to have great features. However, I cannot get the app to connect without being on WiFi. I reached out to their staff and they were extremely friendly but the issue is still happening months later. The app also seems to be calculating my pregnancy week 1 week off from all of my other apps. For some reason it is one week behind even though I entered the same due date.

Title: Excitment cut short
----------------------------------------------------------
I was really looking forward to this app and ignored all the locked icons I saw on exercises and recipes, thinking that they would get unlocked as I completed workouts and goals. Nope, pay to play. The amount you get to do on your free version is about 5-10% of what is potentially offered. It honestly isn't even worth it to have the free trial: one exercise regime and no recipes.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there - thank you for sharing your thoughts! So you know, when you do the free trial that does unlock all content so you can see what Premium is like. We do make it very clear in that app description that the app is free with a Premium upgrade, this allows us to work with top experts to create safe, effective, and stage-specific fitness and wellness programs and to offer an entirely ad-free experience for all users. We're about to launch some really exciting updates to the free app so do keep an eye out for that!

Title: Evil money stealing sham app
----------------------------------------------------------
I don‚Äôt remember ever agreeing to a paid version. I just started getting noticed it was charging me $20 occasionally. Whenever I tried to click ‚Äúmanage subscription‚Äù to cancel the page would go white and never load. I finally was able to cancel my subscription today after I don‚Äôt know how many tries. This app took $60+ from me and I never used it once! Click with caution.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there - we're sorry to hear you feel this way, however, the only way you can be charged for the app is by actively authorizing the upgrade to Premium using your Apple ID, giving Apple permission to bill you for the subscription plan. If you do start a free trial on the app and don't cancel within the trial period you are rolled over into the subscription plan and we make that very clear throughout the app experience. We'd be happy to talk to you further about this if you reach out to us at team@baby2body.com. You can also speak to Apple by going to reportaproblem.apple.com.

I finally paid for the subscription for this app and was thrilled to get more personalized workouts by week. I got to look at my workouts a total of two times before the app stopped working. I will click on my workouts now and then the app closes. I tried deleting and redone loading, my phone is updated to the latest update and so is the app. I am very disappointed

Title: 1 lesson for free
----------------------------------------------------------
It looked ok, I liked the first video.  However I quickly found out that was the 1 and only video unless I wanted to pay. I knew there were in app purchases, I didn‚Äôt know I had to pay to use it.  Why not just be honest and charge up front?  Again it looked good & I liked the first video, I did not like the misleading of it being a ‚Äúfree‚Äù app.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there! It sounds like you're referring to the workouts in the Fitness Studio, and full access to that is part of our Premium experience, which we outline fully in the app description. As a free member you get your first workout free every week, but you also get at least one free recipe per week, stage specific articles are free every week, you get access to all breathing exercises on the app as well as our daily guided pelvic floor exercise. On top of that you get access to all Daily Bites, our tracking features, and your Timeline. Those features are part of the free app, which is why it is listed as a free app with an optional in-app upgrade to Premium. Premium gives you access to all workouts that are part of your personalized plans, as well as all recipes and meal plans, and guided meditations. We do keep the app entirely ad-free for all users so that is a safe space dedicated to each woman's health and wellness, and that is why we have the optional Premium upgrade to access the full experience.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, we know pregnancy brain is a very real thing! Our app is $119.99 USD for a full year of access, which means it's $9.99 per month for full daily guidance on your pregnancy health and wellness, complete personalized workout plans that update every week, new recipes and meal plans every week as well as meditations and wellbeing support suited to your stage. I'm sorry to hear that still feels like a lot, we understand it's not right for everyone! If you'd like to email us at support@baby2body.com we would be happy to help you navigate requesting a refund from Apple and getting this resolved on your end.

Title: Worthless Unless You Pay For It
----------------------------------------------------------
I hate a app that is 100% set up to make you pay and is outrageously expensive for a application on your cellphone. This app fits that description. You get one workout free then anything else you need to pay for and they want a unrealistic monthly payment for the services provided.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, we're sorry to hear you feel this way, but we do outline that this is a free app with an optional Premium upgrade. The free features include: full access to Daily Bites full of stage-specific tips, updates on baby, and healthy living motivations and quotes, pelvic floor exercises, all of our guided breathing exercises, one free recipe per week, one free workout per week in the Fitness Studio plus the weekly circuit workout in the Learn section of the Fitness Studio, and full access to all tracking features and the Timeline -- which is a lot more than the one workout you mentioned. The Premium upgrade does unlock access to all content, giving you personalized programs suited for your stage of pregnancy. Our quarterly subscription gives you access to all programs for $13 a month, which is a lot less than any gym membership and less than most other fitness apps (which aren't catered to pregnancy). Plus you get weekly meal plans for pregnancy and access to all meditations and wellbeing support. Thanks for giving Baby2Body a try and sorry to hear it wasn't for you. Wishing you all the best going forward!

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi Ellie, I'm sorry to hear it didn't feel as though there was enough for you to access on the free version. So you know, as a free member you have access to: all daily bites which include two daily tips suited to your stage related to your healthy lifestyle, a daily update on baby's growth and development, and motivational support as well. You also get access to all guided breathing exercises, and our daily pelvic floor exercise, as well as full access to the tracking features and Timeline. Every week you also get at least one of our featured recipes of the week, at least one stage specific article per week, and the first workout in your weekly plan. Upgrading to Premium gives you full access to your personalized workout plan built by prenatal and postnatal fitness experts, as well as our full library of recipes and weekly meal plans built by one of our prenatal nutritionists. We keep the app entirely ad free for all users so that it is a safe, private space for everyone, and for that reason we do have have a Premium upgrade. Thank you for trying the app, and please email us at team@baby2body.com if you would be interested in doing a free trial of our Premium experience!

Hi there! Our full personalized workout programs are part of the Premium experience but we do offer a 7-day free trial that allows you to try all of the workouts in your weekly program.

Also, every week your workout plans will update and even on the free version that will update your free workout each week so you can try something new. If you'd like to email us at support@baby2body.com we'd be more than happy to help you get set up with the  7-day trial or answer any other questions. We'd love for you to be able to give Premium a proper try, which is why we have the trial as an option for all users.

Title: Nothing is free
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded this app for exercise tips and can‚Äôt get a single preview with the free version. No way I‚Äôm paying $7/mo after downloading the free version and getting NOTHING I wanted. Deleting.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi Whitty 45678, we're very sorry to hear you were disappointed with the app. It's true that Baby2Body is free to download and comes with a premium upgrade to access the coaching experience with stage-specific fitness workouts. However the app does have a lot of free features including a daily update on baby‚Äôs growth; 2 stage-specific tips for you on either your fitness, wellbeing, nutrition, or look every single day; a daily motivational quote; complete access to the Baby2Body community; our My Day journal feature to record your feelings and important milestones; and 50+ articles from the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists covering your most important health topics. If you'd like to try the premium upgrade I'd be more than happy to help you set up a free trial so you can check out all that premium has to offer (recipes, workouts meditations and more to coach you through staying healthy and fit through pregnancy and beyond)! If you're interested in this, please reach out to us at team@baby2body.com.

Title: No Connection
----------------------------------------------------------
After paying to upgrade, I tried to open the app at the gym, and it says I have no internet access. I have good cellular service at my gym and can connect to my other apps. Very disappointed.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi Kacee81, sorry to hear you're having trouble connecting at the gym! When you download the app the default setting is for it to be turned off for cellular data, meaning it would only work on wifi. This is an easy fix though! All you have to do is go to your phone settings > Cellular data > make sure that Baby2Body is turned on (the button should be green). Do let me know if this works and allows you to use the app at the gym! Please email me at team@baby2body.com if you continue to have trouble and we'll be sure to figure out what's going on.

Title: You have to pay
----------------------------------------------------------
As it turns out mostly everything on the app is locked and requires premium membership to access. Don‚Äôt be fooled as they will get your data but won‚Äôt return anything useful to you.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, we're sorry to hear that you're upset about our Premium upgrade. We strive to make it as clear as possible that we offer a free app with a Premium upgrade, and to unlock all content you must upgrade to Premium. As a business,‚Äã we chose to keep the app entirely free of ads for everyone, to keep it a personal, safe space - which is why we developed Premium content to offer unique coaching programs on a subscription basis - similar to many other apps on the market. We're sorry to hear Baby2Body isn't right for you, but we wish you all the best and good health going forward!

Unlike other apps this one has you sign up and then any link or article you click on a pop up shows ‚Äúsign up for premium‚Äù. Other apps provide this info for free so why bother.

Hi there - we're so sorry for this trouble.

We are a very small team so we appreciate your patience! The app should be working as normal now, but if you have any continued issues please email us at team@baby2body.com and we will work to get it fixed right away.

I got this to workout... I can do one workout a week unless I pay for premium. Same with the yoga , meals and zen stuff. Unless you‚Äôre gonna pay don‚Äôt get it.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, we're sorry to hear that you were disappointed about the Premium upgrade though we do try to make it very clear that in order to access full, personalized programs you do have to upgrade. In order to continue creating a great product and working with top trainers and experts we have to charge for the workout programs, meditations, and meal plans we create. We wish you all the best and good health going forward! Thank you for trying Baby2Body.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there! The trial and payments are all managed by Apple since it's an in-app subscription linked to your Apple ID, so that's not part of the baby2Body experience at all, but I am sorry to hear about this! We've found Apple has been charging early. What I would do is reach out to them right away at reportaproblem.apple.com, and if they give you trouble there please contact us at team@baby2body.com and we can provide additional information! We'd also hugely appreciate it if you'd reconsider your review to reflect the Baby2Body experience : ) Thank you!

Hi there - we're sorry to hear that you're upset by the in-app subscription for Premium to unlock all content and coaching platforms.

We do wish you all the best and good health going forward!

Hi there! Over the weekend Google Cloud experienced an outage that impacted a large number of applications and websites (including Youtube, Gmail, and Snapchat), and the Baby2Body app was impacted by this as well - causing trouble accessing all of our videos. Google Cloud services have now been fully restored, so the Baby2Body app should be working as normal again. We do apologize for the inconvenience, unfortunately, it was something entirely out of our control. We do hope you'll try the ap again and reconsider this review!

You can contact Apple at reportaproblem.apple.com to have them help you with this!

----------------------------------------------------------
*Update as of 3rd trimester:

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, we appreciate you updating your review though we're sorry to hear about this frustration. The Push It Real Good routine is a strength workout designed to help you get ready for labor and it is built by and demonstrated by one of our prenatal fitness trainers. The routine features a lot of squats and hip strengthening movements that are done throughout the entirety of the Baby2Body program so we're surprised to hear it all felt worthless. It does have two instances of a weighted deadlift in the workout -- and the recommend modification for that is a wider stance, maintaining a straight back, and hinging at the hips only until comfortable -- which our fitness trainer does demonstrate, but I can understand how it can feel less motivating and less clear when you are seeing someone not pregnant showing the moves. We are hoping to make some updates in the future that have further guidance / tips from your coach and eventually allow you to toggle between a pregnant demonstrator and your actual fitness trainer leading the routine. If you'd like to email us at team@baby2body.com we'll be happy to share more on the modifications that might help at this time.
