Title: It Helps Me Accomplish What I Couldn‚Äôt Do On My Own
----------------------------------------------------------
I use this app in conjunction with the website to track calories and activity. It's useful and the large food database and ability to add foods to it are very much appreciated. It needs a way to sync data between the app and website and from one day to the next on the app without having to close the app and reopen it. That would make me change this to a 5 star review. UPDATE 11/9/2020: They have tweaked the app. It‚Äôs more user friendly and the layout is easier to work with. And it syncs now! Still the absolute best food database IMO. They have made it easy to update nutritional information. I used to have to use the website periodically to do certain things the app couldn‚Äôt do, but now I am able to use the app 99% of the time. It never crashes or acts weird. I‚Äôm able to easily track micronutrients as well as macros, which is invaluable in keeping my sodium intake, and therefore my blood pressure, in check. And it works! You must be diligent and weigh/measure when necessary and be honest! The app literally shows you what works and what doesn‚Äôt. I am 61 and quarantine wasn‚Äôt kind to me weight wise. With this app I have lost 14 pounds since June! Be diligent, be honest, and with this wonderful app, anyone can lose weight.

Title: Really great app
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve had this app for a while. Did not use it for the entirety of 2018 (personal issues üòî), but came back to it. All of my info still here as if I had never gone off it.  I love how easy it is to use. Had it initially on Android, switched to Apple.  Easy to use on both platforms.  It‚Äôs actually fun using it as a food diary to record my meals, it is helpful to planning meals ahead of time because i can look at previous meals for nutritional info and see how they can fit into my meal plan. The users are all encouraging of others, a BIG plus.  Enjoy seeing what other peoples meals look like, get ideas and inspiration from them. The best part of this app is that you don‚Äôt feel like its an isolated, static app, you feel ENGAGED in a live, vibrant community where everyone‚Äôs goal is to be a healthier, better person and want the same for each and every person.  You can track your fitness/exercise as well as meals and monitoring of weight. It can calculate your individual recommended caloric intake based on your input values so you can adjust what you eat based on your goals of losing, gaining, maintaining. And its super easy to use.

Title: The app fits what I am looking for!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm lovin‚Äô this app so far, just into it for a week.  I was tracking most of my diet info in a spreadsheet prior  and I really like the ease and availability of the food selections and their specs along with their crisp, easy to read presentation, nice Job! I switch between the web app while at my computer and I really like the graphs to see where I‚Äôm at. Just started to look through what‚Äôs offered in premium and I would definitely pay for these features as I finely tune my usage and become proficient with it, but honestly I think your sweet spot right now is between $2.99 and $3.99 per month.  Bigger and more graphs on the mobile and web app would be great!  Until people like myself get enough time to use and appreciate the app and assess its value, your higher price is a psychological hurdle, at least for me.  I‚Äôve learned to trust my gut in app purchases and the fact that I did not jump in immediately confirms that.  I‚Äôll certainly have more feedback as I get into it further. Overall, I think you guys are on the right track with a really nice app and I‚Äôm anxious to see what‚Äôs coming next!

Title: Great app & preferred over myfitness pal
----------------------------------------------------------
I enjoy the layout & design of the app. I love that it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much or shame me when I don‚Äôt track calories or log a workout(?) That was an issue I found with myfitnesspal. The online forums also seem a bit more active and encouraging on this app. The app design is simple & to the point. Nutritional facts are seemingly on point. Not a hard app to figure out at all & they have a broad range of food options and choices. I‚Äôve only found it hard to find nutritional info for obscure Asian snacks. In that case, I try to track for something comparable and factor in calories from the packaging to match my food diary. I love the weigh-in function and the data charts available. You are also not inundated by ads and not at risk of accidentally pressing on an ad and opening a new webpage so that‚Äôs a big win for me! Great app, I would highly recommend to anyone who just wants to keep an easy and accurate food diary. Whatever your fitness or weight loss goals, this is a great app in general to aid those goals.

Title: Comprehensive weight loss app that's easy to use!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is the best weight loss app ever. I have used a few others but they do not compare. You can customize what you want to track, whether carbs, protein, fat etc. It also gives you the full nutritional breakdown of your meals, including salt and cholesterol percentages which is awesome. The recipes are fantastic and you can even participate in community conversations with fellow app users for those that want support. Adding food/recognizing label codes are super easy to do. My 5 stars are more like 4.5 stars. I took off half a star because a few times the barcode reader can be a bit off when scanning items. exp...The label may say 10 carbs or calories etc, but what is registered may be a higher or lower number. So at the end of the day your total count may be off by a few digits. Not sure if it is the fault of the app or the barcode. Either way, it is a mild nuisance that doesn't occur often enough to be problematic. With that being said, the app is awesome and I 100% recommend it.

Title: Useful and simple
----------------------------------------------------------
I was looking for a calorie tracker that would record whatever I put into it, but this app does so much more. Not only does it do that, it also comes with a database to help me find caloric information on a wide variety of foods, plus it tracks activities (even resting!) and calorie burn. It's simple and I really like it. I haven't used the barcode scanner yet but so far I haven't had any problems. I also like the fact that I don't have to sign up for anything, it's an independent and free app. I think you can sign up for an account to get more weight-loss help, which is a nice option, but I don't like apps that force you to sign up for stuff. Also, as for the complaints about losing the Weight Watchers point counter, I don't know for sure, but Weight Watchers has its own app so maybe they complained because they didn't want another app using its trademarked info? Just a thought. I wouldn't hold it against Calorie Counter though.

Title: Longtime user, best app out there.
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been a member of Fat Secret since 2011. When the smartphone app became available, I jumped right onboard. The database is so large I can't think of a single time that I wasn't able to find a food I'd eaten. I've tried My Fitness Pal but it's too cluttered and not as user-friendly as Fat Secret. I'm also a member of Weight Watchers Online, and I log daily in both apps. What's nice about FS is that I can track my weight daily whereas I have to wait an entire week to log my WW weight. There's something about having that daily commitment that really keeps me on point. I'm also a fan of the fat-carb-protein breakdown that you can see on the desktop site, so I wish they could bring that to the app. Since you can still see your total grams of each macro at the top of your food log, you can do the math in your head, but that pie chart is hot. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Title: This Is A Good App
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm a Muay Thai fighter/coach, and marathon/ultra marathon runner, and I downloaded this app because I was switching to a high fat, low carb diet to train for my next ultra marathon, and I just need to be a little more efficient at using fat for fuel. This app has been extremely helpful in tracking my caloric intake as well as allowing me to keep track of my macro nutrient intake. There are a ton of foods already in the app, and if you can‚Äôt find exactly what you‚Äôre looking for, it allows you to enter the nutritional information for the food and save it. You can also enter any exercise and how many hours you sleep any given night to show how many calories you‚Äôre burning in a day, and what your caloric intake should be depending on your goals (losing, maintaining, or gaining weight). I highly recommend this app.

Title: Loyal fan
----------------------------------------------------------
I used fat secret before it was a mobile app. I would log on from my computer. It has been helpful in my efforts to lose weight and get in shape (multiple times!). The calorie counter has pretty much all the foods I eat and there is a good listing of exercises. I use it on my Apple Watch as well. I do miss the communities-the social network piece that used to be on the computer version-maybe it still is there-I just don't access it from my computer. I would like to see this enhancement in the future: the option to enter all your food in the morning and then check it off throughout the day. I do enter everything in the morning now, but then the watch tells me I have 0 calories. Just a little thing, but would be nice. Oh and a water counter-so I can make sure I get 8 glasses a day

Title: Saved my life!
----------------------------------------------------------
What an awesome App! I was classified  as obese when applying for life insurance & 5' 7" tall I weighed 245 lbs and at risk of diabetes & heart disease. I found this app & plugged in my goal weight as per my insurance company's guidelines and with that I was told the number of calories I should be eating daily! I was surprised to see what a "serving" is compared to what I was actually eating! Using the app & some exercise...yes you have to exercise....I am now 188 as of today 1.10.16 no longer obese, insured at a normal rate, no longer in danger of diabetes or heart disease. I plug in what I eat which means I DO NOT DENY myself of any foods & I exercise. Please note it takes time....it took me 3 years to drop the 50 lbs but I've kept it off for 3 years!!! Good Luck!

Title: My experience with Fat Secret
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used Fat Secret for several years now. I used it to lose 25 lbs several years ago via calorie cycling, and chose it because a calorie cycling friend was using it, it had lots of good features, and it was FREE. However, once the weight was lost, I stopped tracking the calories I consumed, my weight eventually rebounded, and I added some more weight, as well. Because studies show that people who maintain long term weight loss track calories, exercise regularly, and eat a low fat diet, I have returned to Fat Secret as a tool to help me once again lose the weight, and this time maintain it by tracking my calorie intake. My goal is to lower my set weight progressively this time and maintain it. I have already seen good early results after less than 2 weeks.

Title: It works if you work it
----------------------------------------------------------
A great calorie counting app. If you've counted calories (or fat grams, or any other food stat) manually, you'll love the ease of doing it digitally. FatSecret makes it really easy - tons of foods (including brand names) to chose from, adjustable portions, etc. If you can't find the food you're looking for, just google the food and fatsecret - there's often an entry from another country that will suit you. (I live outside my country of origin and this is a helpful feature for me). You can also save entire meals and recipes so you don't have to re-enter entire groups of specialized foods. You can also enter exercise. This is a great app to help you stay conscious of what you eat, which is a necessary first step to changing your eating patterns.

Title: Love the new iPad version
----------------------------------------------------------
It makes it easy to keep track of weight and food.  I can easily share the meals across to my husband who is trying to loose weight too, but I did have to search hard for that ability. This new version makes it easier to keep unusual exercises/activities so they don‚Äôt have to be entered from scratch each time.  Kudos for that.  It‚Äôs also easier to move back to yesterday and add what you had for dinner if you didn‚Äôt the night before.  The sharing of info with HEALTH on the apple platforms is helpful since there is no blood pressure monitoring in your app.  Thanks for the hard work on the app, I used to prefer the desktop (and that should be updated) but with the new version the only reason I use the desktop is to share meals with hubby.

Title: Great except....
----------------------------------------------------------
I really enjoy this app and being able to track my calories, carbs, protein etc. the major problem I have is the app doesn‚Äôt know the difference between total carbs and net carbs. So for all you Atkins users and people like me who are blending Atkins food/snacks into our keto diet, I recommend you create your own food instead of using the search results. Otherwise the app will say you‚Äôre getting X number of carbs when you‚Äôre actually getting Y number of NET carbs. I would also like to be able to alter the stuff that automatically comes up. If you find Boar‚Äôs Head stuff, for example, you cannot alter the nutritional info. Which points you back in the direction of just creating your own custom food. Other than that this app is great!

Title: Worthwhile Effort for Weight Loss
----------------------------------------------------------
I had reached a goal with the Keto Diet and wanted to find an app that would take what foods I input and give me the calories, carbs, fat and protein percentage needed to keep losing weight gradually while converting to the Mediterranean Diet.  I have been very satisfied with this app as I tend to eat healthy but occasionally give myself too many ‚Äúgreen lights‚Äù.  This App has made me think about what I am eating weekly.  I input my menu for the coming week over the weekend.  I shop accordingly and prepare overnight breakfasts, grains, etc. ahead.  I am eating more balanced and satisfying meals. I am able to see results both visually and physically and feel good while doing it.  I strongly recommend this diet.  Easy does it!

Title: Great App - One Request
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a great app for tracking food intake and exercise.  The barcode scanner doesn't work on my iPod (4th), no big deal, I figure it was designed to work on the iPhone, so I use the keypad entry for UPC.  One Request - It would be REALLY nice if I could access my history of food and exercise within the app on my iPod without requiring an internet connection.  There are times when I want to check on what I've eaten previously, but can't because I'm not connected (which happens a lot in a rural area or on the road). An embedded notepad in the app would also come in handy for jotting down food and exercise when there's no internet connection.  I even looked for a paid version of this app that might have these features.

Title: Suggestion
----------------------------------------------------------
Love the app, but have a suggestion and there wasn't an option for sending one in the app. It would be nice if we could put the time of our meals in. So you can set reminders for eating, water, or vitamins. Just setting a reminder time isn't enough because schedules change. Your wakeup time and subsequent breakfast may vary from day to day, as mine does. So setting the same reminder schedule isn't sufficient. This way you'll know when you last ate and can remind yourself to eat again at whatever duration works for you. I need to eat every 3-4 hrs or I binge. But I'll get busy and totally forget for 6, then it's a recipe for disaster. Or I don't consume all of my prepped food for the day, which is just as bad.

Title: Excellent resource
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using fat secret to count my sugars. As a diabetic, I have to be careful with refined sugars, carbs, and starches, and some things spoke my levels more than others. Using this tool has not only helped me figure out which foods are no-no‚Äôs for me, it‚Äôs also helped me lose weight. The menu planner counts sugars, calories, fats, etc., for me. I don‚Äôt have to think about everything. There‚Äôs a weigh in page to record weight loss progress, and even a spot to put in your own recipes for easy recall. There‚Äôs a community attached, as well- people there are helpful, make great suggestions, and just generally support one another‚Äôs journeys. Overall, I'm very impressed with this valuable (and free!!!) resource.

Title: Really good app for calorie intake and nutrition balance
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been tracking my calories and food on this app and I love it! My doctor put me on a 1200 calorie diet to lose weight. This encourages me to eat at home more and and track my ingredients down to the brand. Some brands of things are not available so sometimes I‚Äôll choose a standard description which is probably not off by much if any. It also helps me to discipline my eating habits. I enter in what I plan to eat before I eat it so that I know I‚Äôm not going to go over my calorie limit and to see if I am balancing out on fat, protein, and carbs. Most cases I want more protein and less fat and carbs. This app shows a chart that keeps up with this! This helps tremendously! Definitely worth the download!

Title: Flexible, customizable, better than similar apps
----------------------------------------------------------
I tried several calorie counting apps and this one worked the best for me. You don't have to sign up for a website, but you can if you want too, which is a nice touch. This app has had all the different kinds of food items I have searched for so far, and you can select between various portion options (weight, volume, unit, etc.) which is convenient; other apps I tried only had cups of one food item, grams of another, etc. which is a pain. You can also edit your target daily calorie level or just accept the one the app recommends to you based on your profile, activity level, and weight loss goals. Simple and sweet! Try this app first and save yourself some time.

I LOVE this app! You can keep track of your calories without all the annoying ‚Äúreminders‚Äù and other useless prompts. I read some guy‚Äôs rant on Quora about how the only ‚Äúdiet‚Äù that works is one where you are in a calorie deficit DAILY. A üí° went off and since then I have been tracking my calories and try to keep below 1400.  I have been very successful at this even on vacation. I scrutinize everything I put in my mouth and constantly look for healthier swaps or ways to cut back. In 11 weeks I‚Äôve lost 14 pounds without having to kill myself with strenuous workouts. I‚Äôve had trouble losing weight most of my adult life but now feel like I‚Äôve beat that demon! üòä

At this point everyone knows that quarantine has affected a lot of people‚Äôs weight and for me it was weight gain. I finally decided I should start losing the pounds by ‚Äúdieting‚Äù first and realized after talking to friends I don‚Äôt need to necessarily cut off certain foods completely but just eat in smaller portions. After searching up calorie trackers online, FatSecret came up, I gave it a try, and now I‚Äôm genuinely committed to my health and my goal of weight loss! I haven‚Äôt stopped using it, and keeping track of the foods I eat while interacting with others in the social part of the platform has been a great motivator for me. Get the app!!!

Title: Valuable Tool
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using this app for seven months.  If you are wondering where the faults are in your diet this will show you.  I have lost thirty-five pounds this year, it's not a prison sentence, there are plenty of days when I reach the end of the day and there are still enough calories left for a small junk food cheat.  If you are honest with it, the app will tell you the truth.  Not always pleasant after a 1300 calorie All Star Breakfast at three in the morning and you discover you are at 192% of your daily food budget.  That is to say, it is a guide, a metric to measure, it doesn't do the work for you but it will give you a fighting chance

----------------------------------------------------------
I've been looking at all of the descriptions and features of similar apps (Free and with a cost), and this one has by far the most features.  It is also easy to use and you can even "SCAN" the bar code of an item to upload the nutrition information for that item.  It is a great app.  You need however to have a little patience when using it because occasionally you get a message stating "network not available" and you have to try your operation again.  Calories burned per activity seem pretty accurate according to your weight, height and daily activity level.  I would recommend this app...PLUS it is free, so you have nothing to loose :)

My friend has been doing weight watchers and I was looking for an app to help me. This has been perfect and it is free. I have been able to track everything very simply.  I love the bar code feature. It makes shopping and tracking so easy. I like the way it keeps track of recently eaten items or exercises. We are creatures of habit and usually do or eat something a couple days in a row. I usually load my usual items in first thing in the morning. If I pack my lunch I load that info as well. Then when I get home if I haven't eaten something I can subtract it. I have shared the app with at least a dozen people who really like it.

Im at that age where I'm going through the change. My metabolism has slowed down and I've put on about 17 pounds that I cannot get rid of even though I work out 3-5 days a week.  I now have the Apple watch and this app!!! A dynamic duo!! My watch tracks my heart rate, my workouts and do much more AND it helps me push myself a little more!! Combine that with your app which breaks down carbs, proteins, calories etc and accounts for calories burned .. And I have lost 4.5 pounds in 2 1/2 weeks BUT I am eating whenever I am hungry.  This app helps me keep my carb intake down among other variables!  I might get this weight off!!!!

This app is so easy to use and yet it's got so much to it! I've only been using this app for 3 days and absolutely love it. You can scan barcodes of the foods you eat, adjust the serving amount, and take pictures of it too. It shows you a line graph of the progress you have made, as well as a recommended daily intake (rdi) of calories per day based off of BMI (not accurate but it gives you a starting point). If you don't have a barcode to scan then you can get a general idea of calories by searching "Bacon" which brings up different ways bacon can be cooked and treated with a general idea on serving and calorie sizes.

----------------------------------------------------------
Compared side by side with iTrackBites with in-app purchases, and I greatly prefer FatSecret. Note that this app is a calorie counter whereas the other is point-based. Wish I could get a refund for the other app, and give to FatSecret. Easier "one stop" search engine instead of searching multiple lists, manually. Either more food choices, or search engine is more intuitive; I couldn't find more items in the other app than found in FatSecret. And using this app, following their calorie limit, I lose 8 lbs in first month; for me this is a surprise.  I like this app and will continue to use it. Thanks for reading!

My friend turned me on to this app.  We are trying to be calorie conscious on the way to our fitness goals and The Calorie Counter by FatSecret has been very helpful!  It has a huge database of nutrition information and what isn't there you can enter in yourself in a snap!  The UPC scan feature is very convenient too!  All this along with the fact that it pairs an equally user friendly log for calories burnt during daily exercise and graphs and charts to give you a pictorial view of your progress in every area is a great way to see trends in your eating and activity habits.  Get the app.  You won't regret it!

I really like this app. I was previously just counting calories with my calculator, but this is way easier and saves all my information. Almost any food is found in the FatSecret system, and if you can't find a food you can do a custom entry. I am particularly fond of the analysis functions, which allow me to see how much carbs, fat and protein I'm eating. I can also track my exercise each day and my sleep habits. I wish that it had a function where I could count my own calories burned while exercising, the built-in calorie count seems to be higher than what my exercise machine tells me I'm burning.

FatSecret has not only enabled me to track my calories, fat, carbs, weight, etc., it has given me deep insight as to which foods are more nutritional than others. I am 73 and wanted to slowly lose 40 lbs. I log every bite I eat (no matter how small) + weight + exercise into this APP every day. My RDI is set for 1,400 calories per day, and this APP has enabled me to identify yummy foods that are high protein, low fat, low carbs, low sugar. With the adjustments I've made, I somehow manage to thrive on an avg of 1,200 cal or less/day, enjoy my fav foods, and I have yet to crave anything or be hungry.

Fabulous app. Very useful. Very helpful. I love how easy this app is to use you can keep track of your weight, exercise, goals, and your food intake. You can look up each item you eat, whether you eat out buy something at the store and then fix it at home. Once you select it and indicate the amount you ate, it shows the amount of fat, carbs, protein, etc. you consumed and then you can see your totals for the day at the top of the page. It also show the percentages. I have FatSecret on my PC and am using the app on my phone and they automatically sync what you enter. Best tool ever!! LOVE IT!!!!

Title: Fabulous!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have never written a review before but this app is just too awesome not to.  I was diagnosed with diabetes and with this app I track total carbs, protein, sugar, fat and sodium.  There's other options available also.  It has name brand foods, restaurants and a barcode scanner.  It also has a wonderful website and great support if you need it.  There's just too many great things to notate but you won't be sorry if you try it!  I've lost 45 lbs and I'm still losing and my diabetes and high blood pressure is controlled!  I feel like a brand new person!  I will never be without Fatsecret!

Title: Keeping Focus - Balance is Key
----------------------------------------------------------
Anything new is awkward and out of rhythm. I never tracked my food closely especially every time I ate. Plus, I was very honest no cheating. Meaning I logged everything. In 7 months just by accurately knowing my cal intake versus my cal burn I always stayed at a deficit. In 7 months I lost very slowly 20lbs. This diet and my daily walking and every other day gym weight routine was an effort that paid off. I feel the best in 25 years. I‚Äôm wearing cloths again that were my favorites. Thank goodness I kept them. Oh, I‚Äôm 66 years old. Never let anyone tell you it‚Äôs too late. It‚Äôs not. :)

Title: No nonsense calorie counter!
----------------------------------------------------------
Honestly, the name of this app was a little off putting but I decided to give it a shot because I just don‚Äôt like the other more popular blue app to count calories. Fat Secret is easy to use, has minimal ads, recipe calculator/cookbook, recipes, community, challenges, browser access, food photo journal that you can choose to share with the community or not, and recipes, fitness tracker, a calendar to see which days you tracked and which you didn‚Äôt! It‚Äôs full service! It even has a service for adding your health professional‚Äôs email so you can send your data to them! It‚Äôs incredible!

Title: Similar to Noom
----------------------------------------------------------
I used noom before this and it was good. I wanted to get back into that model but couldn‚Äôt afford the cost of noom, so I searched alternative options that worked similar to that but free or low cost. So glad I did, one month in I‚Äôve lost 8 lbs and not felt hungry or deprived. I‚Äôm making yummy dinners for the family and eating everything they are. This just helps me pay attention to how much I‚Äôm consuming of those foods. My stomach has shrunk, I‚Äôm guessing, because I‚Äôm enjoying all this but not feeling like eating nearly the quantities I used to eat. Feeling lighter and satisfied.

Title: Calorie Counting
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app, FatSecret, so easy to use .  I‚Äôve been 40lbs over weight for 10 years.  I thought I could lose weight on my own by just watching my food intake and portion control, but all I have been doing is maintaining my weight, not gaining any more but not losing it either.  Since using this app and actually recording my food and calories I‚Äôm a lot more aware of unnecessary snacking and actual portion sizes. I‚Äôve lost 5 lbs in 2-1/2 weeks, not a lot so far, but I finally feel on track to permanent weight loss and then maintaining my goal weight. Thank you, I love this app.

Title: Great app and it works!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app. After many years, I am a Weight Watchers convert. This app tells me every calorie I am eating and how many I am burning. I had a few questions along the way, but got them answered quickly by the support staff. I do wish that when selecting portions of an item that 1/3 and 2/3 was available to select. Many recipes call for thirds and it isn‚Äôt an option. This would make an already great app an excellent app. I‚Äôm 69 and it isn‚Äôt easy to lose weight at this age, but I‚Äôve lost 5 of the 15 pounds I want to lose using this app. This app is easy to use and addicting.

I really appreciate the focus on protein/fat/carbs and micronutrients as well. I really appreciate that you can fully customize all of those individual pieces! Not to mention the community of people posting is so encouraging! I‚Äôm still amazed that many positive people can be connecting on an app without some Negative Nancy‚Äôs. It‚Äôs easy to use once you figure it out. (Is there a video somewhere we could watch that shows you how to access all the various features? I couldn‚Äôt find the diet calendar that shows calories in/out for awhile). All I wish we could do is scan barcodes!

This app is great to be conscious of what you‚Äôre eating and exercising as well. The nutritional value of the food is calculated for you when you enter the amount you‚Äôve eaten. It is very user-friendly, easy to use and understand. Many foods have already been entered, and you can manually enter your own recipes to learn the calorie counts and nutritional information. By being conscious of what I‚Äôm eating, I‚Äôve been able to reduce my caloric input and I‚Äôve lost 9 pounds so far. There is also a feature where you can connect with others for encouragement and ideas and recipes.

----------------------------------------------------------
I have used all kinds of apps to track my weight and what I am eating, but have always returned to Fat Secret.  Why?  Because in every other app I had to Google the nutrient amount of each food and add it manually.  Fat Secret offers the basic weight tracking and complete nutrition information, as well as a page where others share recipes and offer advise or congratulations, again without cost.  If you want more tracking it‚Äôs offered as a step up, i.e. water tracking, etc.  I have used Fat Secret for years and have stopped wasting money trying to find something better.

----------------------------------------------------------
Fat Secret has been a great app to help me lose weight by tracking not only calories but, macros by the day and week, add your own recipes, take photos of your meals, add notes to share (or not share) with others on the app, and look up recipes. I was a faithful My Fitness Pal user on and off for years until I did an update and they wanted to charge me to remove ads that I didn‚Äôt have before the update. I‚Äôm glad they did because I would have never found Fat Secret. This app is free. However, if I were to spend any money on a health app it would be this one‚Ä¶Fat Secret!

----------------------------------------------------------
This app has helped me to be more aware of what I eat. I had gained 10 pounds after I moved to Italy and I couldn‚Äôt really figure out why! One might think because of all the pasta and carbohydrates but no! Not me! I hardly ever eat pasta or pizza. So, I would starve myself and eat off fruit only more or less! Little did I know, fruit was my enemy ü§™ As soon as I started counting calories and having a more balanced diet, I realized how high-calorie some fruit could be. I haven‚Äôt lost much yet (only 3pounds in 3 weeks) but I know it‚Äôs working. Thank you Fat Secret team!

Title: Well done ... Best of 1/2 dozen apps tried
----------------------------------------------------------
My goal is to count the calories I eat during the day and and track how close to my maximum.  This app does the trick.  Lets me scan in items that I'm eating prepackaged.  For cooking with a scale to measure the weights of ingredients, allows me to measure the amounts in grams and does the conversions calories, fat etc.  Possible improvements might include let me repeat the meal quickly ‚Äì when I have multiple ingredients it's a pain to have to enter each all over again.  And, let me pay you a few dollars more to get rid of advertisements at the bottom of the screen.

----------------------------------------------------------
When it said I should eat about 2600 calories a day to lose weight, I thought, "no freaking way." I found out that I was gaining weight because I was under eating and over exercising. Apparently a lot of dietitians have people like me come in. So since I have been using this app, I have lost 10 lbs but trying to eat that much calories sometimes is a hard thing for me when I work all day. But I'm trying! I've got about 15 more to lose till I'm happy! And I'm sure I'll be using this app for the rest of my life to make sure I stay on track. Thanks, FatSecret!

----------------------------------------------------------
I have used this app for the past four months to track my caloric intake and macros. It is so easy to enter the foods you eat, and it has helped me understand exactly how I am feeding my body. I focus mostly on protein intake, and the fats and carbohydrates naturally show up with the addition of fruits and vegetables. It also helps when deciding whether or not to add pleasure calories like beer and ice cream. There is no substitute for tracking what you eat, and FatSecret is the perfect tool to make this an easy part of your daily routine!

----------------------------------------------------------
My doctor, perhaps being something of a Luddite, asked me to bring a paper record of meals (and glucose readings) to help my diabetes control. Assuming that ‚ÄúThere must be an app‚Äù for that, I tried 3 or 4 apps that I though might work. Most didn‚Äôt offer any export/print capability, at all; one  required a subscription before that ability was enabled, but did at least have a 30 day trial period. So I signed up, and I was very disappointed to see that they only exported meal totals, not including the foods, and no  charts or report output.

I am happy to finally have found an app to track my food for free.

The food diary is extremely user friendly and helps me see more than just the amount of calories I‚Äôm taking in. I also see the proteins the fats, carbs, sugars, etc. all for free. I‚Äôve lost 13 pounds of purely stubborn fat and I attribute a lot of that towards this app.

I haven‚Äôt deprived myself of foods that I want, just allowed myself the portion size that fits into my daily calorie intake and with light physical activity, I‚Äôm really losing weight in a sustainable way. It‚Äôs the two week mark, and my pants fit better. It‚Äôs encouraging and sustainable for me.

I also don‚Äôt like the following other people interface, but I didn‚Äôt like this on WW either.  Overall, hard to beat the value for cost/ad ratio.  I haven‚Äôt tried any of the meal plans.

Being that I have an iPod with limited wifi access if you guys were to update the app and add the database to the internal memory it would make this app the only app worth getting!  You could charge $20 for this app and it would be worth it if you added the data base!  Without it iPod users are limited in many ways.

Living in Beijing so many european brands are not listed not to mention some of the asian food I eat so i do improvise a bit with my calorie counts. In any case this app really helps me stay focused and the results are showing. Hope the new update I downloaded will be as good. Anyone who is motivated to control their calories and keep high protein like me should try it!

----------------------------------------------------------
If you know your calorie marks, this is a great way to enter them in and keep track. You can track exercise and weight too. There‚Äôs a bar graph for weight and you can set a target. I used Noom for about a week and that was good but I ultimately decided not to pay $25/month for it. This app is free and fantastic. A little clunky in entering Saved Meals and figuring out initially how to set your own calorie target if you don‚Äôt want to use their auto-calculated one, but you get the hang of it after a couple days. Five stars.

I think only 1 time this year I had to manually enter in a food - rest of the time, scan barcode and there it is.  If all this doesn‚Äôt get better - it‚Äôs free!

Also it would be nice to be able to customize some things you track for example I would like to track the amount of iron I eat. But other than that this is a great app.

Great experience in terms of ease of use, extensive food database, bar code or search option, tracks macros by list and graphs tracks goals in weight, nutrients, calories burned, etc etc, everything the other apps do plus this one has a daily notes feature and I can customize any feature  ....all for free. Love it!!!

Title: Best calorie app I have come across
----------------------------------------------------------
The barcode scanner is my fav part. I made a grill cheese sandwich today and just scanned what I used and put how much I used of each and bam grill cheese with my ingredients.

Great app.... Thank you for creating it will recommend to all friends. And post on my Facebook as my fav app...

Title: Keeps Me on Track
----------------------------------------------------------
If you're looking for an App to help keep you on track, keep track of your daily intake, and be accountable to yourself, this is it! It's the perfect personal assistant for anyone trying to lose weight. It has all of the calorie information for thousands of foods, and it has all of the major restaurants, making eating out a breeze! The weekly weigh in also helps. It records your progress, so you can see how well you're doing and that helps to encourage you and keep you on track!

Title: It‚Äôs SO easy
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve checked out many apps but I keep sticking with Fat Secret. It‚Äôs a simple app and doesn‚Äôt have any distractions. I love that it shows how many macros I eat each day. Many apps charge extra for this. I also love that I can count everything in grams, IMO this is one of the best features. It‚Äôs not pretty and in color like other apps, but it‚Äôs simple, efficient, and best of all, super easy to use. And you never get pestered to upgrade or have annoying ads. It truly is the best!

Title: Love the app!  Hate the name!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was recently diagnosed borderline or pre-diabetic.  Had to get control of my carbs:protein.  Purchased a diabetes specific app and HATED  it-too cumbersome!  FatSecret is excellent and free.  I have diligently used this app and lost 1lb per week - safely and slowly. I'm not to my goal yet (I've only been using this for 6 weeks), but I've made more progress with weight loss than any other program I've used.  Great app-I've recommended it to several friends and family members.

Title: Can't believe it's free!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was thinking of paying for the Weight Watchers online program when I saw a recommendation for this app, and thought I'd try it first since it's free. I've been using it for five days and so far I LOVE it. I especially like that it counts resting calories in addition to exercise, and the diet calendar keeps a running total of what you've eaten and what you've burned. Everything I've eaten has been in the database, and I've had no problems with crashes when using the scanner.

Title: Excellent!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've tried many other apps but none seemed right for me. By chance I ran across this app. This is perfect. The food data base is ideal not only providing commercial product information (which I rarely need as I try to avoid fast foods and processed foods), but also has generic information as well. The photo diet feature is unique in that you simply take a photo of your food and the tech team will analyze it for you providing you nutritional feedback to use. That is amazing!

I have been using FatSecret for a very long time.  It is the easiest way I have found to keep track of what I eat. I love how I am able to control proteins, carbs, and sugar counts.  I measure what I want to measure. This app was made for me. I have the ability to go back through the years and read little notes that I journaled. It helps me To not repeat certain mistakes I‚Äôve made. I highly recommend fatsecret. It‚Äôs made to be personal, and I love the privacy. Its so easy!

Title: Work around for date problem
----------------------------------------------------------
Here's a temporary work around for the date being behind a day. When in the food or exercise diary page where the wrong date appears, to get the correct one, select the "..." menu item at the top right. Then select "Change Date", and next select "Tomorrow", not "Today", which is already selected; you can also select the date for tomorrow on the date wheel below. By selecting the next day, when you press "Done", you'll return to the diary with the correct date now showing.

----------------------------------------------------------
I am in love with this app! Def a huge diff w/counting/tracking calories. Keeps you motivated by keeping you alert in just how much you consume. Track your weight and save recipes or what you normally consume. Saves previously eaten meals and you can enter what isn't in there as well. Another reviewer stated it was glitchy and once in a while I do experience that but the pros outway the cons big time for me. This is my first calorie counter/tracker so I cannot compare.

Title: Been using it for years
----------------------------------------------------------
Back in 2011/2012 I tested out a bunch of calorie counter apps. This app was the one back then that had accurate nutrition facts for restaurants and food from grocery stores.  I deleted the rest and used this.   Over the years I have been testing out newer calorie counter apps that come out just to see what they offer but nothing compares to Fat Secret.  And fat secret may not be all physically appealing like some others, but it‚Äôs simple and easy and it just works.

I fist downloaded this app about 7 years ago and I lost 40lb. Over the last two years I gained about 20 of those lbs back (not eating right and not exercising) so a few months ago I started back with working out and eating right but also started back using this app to help maintain my daily calorie intake and just as before I'm watching my lbs fall off all over again. I love this app. Wish it had more recipe options within the app but over all an amazing resource.

----------------------------------------------------------
I was looking for the app to be able to count the calories intake and none was working for me. Those I‚Äôve tried before were difficult to navigate and look for food I ate. This app is super user friendly, finds a lot of food and offers measuring in oz, grams, cups, prices, etc. It also allows you to scan a barcode and immediately returned the product you are looking for. It also offers additional meal plans for pay, which I haven‚Äôt tried but might in a later time.

Of all the calorie and nutrition apps I‚Äôve tried I like this one the best.  It‚Äôs easy to set up, easy to record and edit your food intake, easy to understand layout.  You can easily print a detailed report of your progress.  If the item you ate isn‚Äôt already in the database you can easily scan the upc and add it. You can easily see your nutrition intake by meal or by day. Carbs, protein, fat etc.  Added bonus you can link your Fitbit to track your activity level.

I started using this app in 2012 and in 6 months lost 15 lbs in a healthy manner. I realized I was just eating too much. There are so many foods in their index and if you can't find one you can add it yourself. Provides great summary of calories for the month and exercise. You can also sync with it on line so you can enter from your lap top, iPad iPhone etc.  If you want to lose weight or just monitor your carb/protein/fat intake and more get this app! Super app!

Title: Excellent food log(ger)
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is easy to use as far as logging food & exercise. Highly recommend for that purpose. I do not utilize the community/social networking feature at all, so I can't comment to that. Only suggestion (& this is because I frequently get my healthy recipes from this source) would be to input the recipes from skinny taste. It gets frustrating having to enter new recipes almost daily - would be great if they were already there! I know it's probably not easy task.

I have to loose some weight and needed some how to keep track of my calories. This App does that and much more! Track calories, weight loss, foods that you've eaten, and your progress. Also, you can chat with others for support! My favorite thing is the Bar Code reader though! You just snap a pic of that bar code and the app gives you all the info on it and logs it for you! I Love this App! I've had it for around 3 weeks now and already lost over 10 pounds!!!

I have used fat secret off and on for at least five years.  I find it‚Äôs easy to look up foods and exercise to plot my daily plan.  What has been most helpful is the ‚Äúsaved meal‚Äù feature for meals I eat on a regular basis.  Even after not using the app for a few years, my saved meals were still available.  I only use the app when I am actively trying to lose weight, but it‚Äôs a great way to get back on track when I have been left to my own devices for awhile.

The only thing I don‚Äôt enjoy is the new connectivity options. I don‚Äôt want or need to see other people‚Äôs food or weight journeys. It‚Äôs thankfully an option so I‚Äôm not forced to see it when I open the app.

FatSecret is fantastic, especially considering it‚Äôs free. You can look up foods individually, by restaurant, by prepackaged product or even supermarket brands. It tracks calories and macros as well as your weight. You can input sleep and exercise. You can run reports on daily and weekly intake. There are sections for recipes and you can take a picture of your food and the app will help with identifying the contents. There‚Äôs so much more!  I love this app!!

The hardest part of tracking all your health activities for me is ease of calculating food.  This app makes it super easy to measure calories or just what you eat.  In addition to that they have a great weight tracker, workout tracker and more.  Then to top it all off it does a great job of helping you visualize it all with great reports.  I was able to identify more easily where I needed to cut back on certain foods and at which meals.  I love this app.

I have used my fitness pal and my plate and both are  excellent. BUT  I stumbled on this, yesterday had haven't really tested it. BUT to a first cut, the section on chains, supermarket, and brands is excellent and maybe more comprehensive than the competitors. Is certainly easy and quick.  Try it and you will probably enjoy it a lot for the simplicity The detailed food tables.  SIMPLE QUICK AND COMPREHENSIVE ESPECIALLY THE CONMERCIAL PARTS OF THE TABLES

You can even track your macros and set goals for your specific food category. Worried it won‚Äôt have your meal? Don‚Äôt! This app has a ton of options and even has an option for you to add the meal manually. So happy I tried this app! I promise this app won‚Äôt disappoint.

There are great people on here. No judgement, work at your own pace and easy to use the app. I have rarely found a brand or a good product they do not already have the exact portion and amount of calories already figured out. All you have to do is tell it what you ate. No more trying to figure it out. Or measuring portions! It even has restaurants so you can figure out what you are going to eat before you go. I would definitely recommend this app.

The layout is, for the most part, better than for MyFitnessPal. Some key things I‚Äôve noticed is that the green layout and the way the calorie numbers are presented make me less upset when I‚Äôve gone slightly over my calorie goals. My fitness pal makes me want to jump off the roof whenever I see that red negative bar at the top right haha. This is HUGE, because it makes tracking feel much less stressful and the overall vibe is much better this way.

If anything it helps you be accountable and actually see what you‚Äôre putting into your body. I‚Äôm also nutrient deficient so I hope this helps me stay on top of that too.
