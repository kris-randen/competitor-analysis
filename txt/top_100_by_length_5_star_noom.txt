Title: Greatest Decision!
----------------------------------------------------------
When I was younger I couldn’t gain weight to save my life. As a result I developed some not so great eating habits. When my metabolism slowed down a little I still had some bad eating habits. I was trying to prepare to be a competitive bodybuilder though so it really didn’t catch up with me until after I decided to stop lifting all of the time because I got married and we wanted a baby. My weight went from 125 to 137 which wasn’t bad at all as I’m 5’6” tall. When I got pregnant I gained exactly 30 pounds during pregnancy, a normal amount of pregnancy weight. I was told I would lose my pregnancy weight while breastfeeding. It didn’t happen. I actually went from 147 post birth to 164. I would get back down to 157 then up to 163 overnight (those bad eating habits from when I was too thin). I considered Noom a couple times in 2020 but didn’t want to spend the money because I was making less money. After I discovered my husband’s sister had already lost several pounds on Noom even while traveling back and forth when her husband was ill I reconsidered Noom. But this time I did more than reconsider. I decided to just dive in! I didn’t realize anything needed to change because I already at a good amount of organic fruits and vegetables. The problem is I was eating in the wrong proportions. I was choosing too little lean protein and too high of fat. I was eating way too much cheese. I started losing weight right away. When my husband heard his sister and I talking about it so frequently and seeing our results he decided to give it a try. Though the scale is 10 pounds less, my waist is 5 inches smaller, and even my arms (big because I used to lift a lot of heavy weights) are smaller my biggest, most noticeable, and most loved result is the increase in energy! My big picture has everything to do with having more energy, being able to be more active with my nearly 3 year old daughter, and not developing diabetes, hypertension and a slew of other health issues older family members have inherited through a combination of genetics and bad habits. Thanks to Noom I am well on my way to having enough energy and good health to be here late into life for my daughter and I couldn’t be happier!

Title: Something that finally works for me
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve tried numerous similar apps in the past and none of them helped me drop ANY weight. I didn’t lose a single pound with those apps and I was using them for months. I couldn’t understand what I was doing wrong, and I blamed it all on myself. I gave on up on the apps for a long time and gained a lot of weight. Finally, I saw an ad for this app and did some reading. When I learned that there’s a psychological level to it, I decided to give it a shot simply because the biggest issue with my weight loss struggle is not having the mentality for it, and not being strong willed enough. The other apps just told me “you have this many calories, and you need to work out more.” Whereas Noom breaks down every little detail for you. What you should be eating and why, the root of your bad habits and how to put a stop to them, it addresses your insecurities and helps you move past them, and it also gives you so much validation. You get walked through every process and every day gives new challenges, and even helps you through your slips and tells you it’s okay, just keep going. I once signed up for an app that once I put in my size, it told me I was morbidly obese and that I needed to lose weight ASAP... at the time, I was 170lbs. Nowhere close to being morbidly obese, but at the time I cried and felt so lost. This app teaches you to love yourself through every step of the process, which is so key to getting results. I have been using this app for almost 2 weeks and I have lost 11lbs. 2 WEEKS! And guess what, I don’t feel starving or deprived because I’m still eating good food that I enjoy. I don’t count my carbs or protein intake, I just choose my meals according to how calorie dense something is. If something is low in calories and high in nutrients, then you can eat more of it and feel full without overeating and gaining weight. It’s that simple!! I highly recommend this app and I can say that 100% it works. And before you wonder, no I was not paid or given any incentive to write this review. Just my completely honest opinion and experience using this app, and I’m paying full price for it.

Title: OMG I can’t believe it’s actually working.
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is not for everyone. I read some negative reviews about how this is a restrictive diet and weight loss program that body shames and keeps you from enjoying food. This app does NONE of those things. It provides evidenced based education about how reasonable food choices and regular activity (not even strenuous activity!!) affects how you feel about your body, no matter what your shape or size. I chose this app bc I’m 48 and really feeling the changes that come with slowing metabolism and a year of pandemic eating. And I was really sick of feeling so uneasy about my body and the underlying health issues I was setting myself up for. Is this app perfect? No, but it has 100% helped me to make incremental behavior changes and decisions that have had positive outcomes in less than a week. I’m eating healthier, feeling hopeful about the future of my health, and walking more...simply to beat the number of steps that I did the previous day. This app is good for people who want to make a change, but want to understand the WHY behind our decision making around food. It’s good for people who are methodical, logical, and interested in seeing the data of how being mindful about food choices results in body and mind changes. This app addresses the whole human being, not just the physical form. And also, there is a live coach that checks in with you and encourages you as you go. I chose the $79 a month service and I’m trying it for 2 months to see how far I can go. I’ve lost 3 pounds already. Which is a lot considering I’ve gained 10 in the last 5 years with disorganized eating and random spurts of exercise. I encourage you to try it for yourself and not listen to others who say it doesn’t work. Unless those other people are an exact clone of you, they don’t know you. Give yourself a chance to see if the science based, psychology backed process appeals to you. If it doesn’t, keep trying until you find something that does! Good luck to you!

Title: The coaching and daily articles really help!
----------------------------------------------------------
About 8 years ago I was 200lbs and ended up losing 75lbs just by increasing my activity. I was in college walking around campus everywhere, had a decent social life, and I walked about 3 miles a day. It felt super easy. Fast forward several years, I’m at a cushy desk job and back up to 200, sometimes fluctuating between 200 and 210. Increasing my activity just hasn’t been a feasible option- I work 50 hrs a week, I have a new baby, and just finished treatments for cancer so I’m dealing with mental and emotional hang ups in addition to a lack of spare time. But the more time that passes at 200lbs the more I yearn for my old, slender, vibrant self. So I decided to finally make a commitment to losing weight again. Noom helped me realize I don’t have to quit anything I love and I don’t have to spend time I don’t have. I can work within the constraints of my daily life and succeed! So I made the necessary modifications and have already lost 6lbs! I’ve only been at it for a few weeks! I still drink, but I drink spiked seltzer water. I still snack, but I eat pickles or fruit or carrots, I still have salad dressing, but I use yogurt-based dressing, I still eat meat and bacon but I measure appropriate amounts! And I record EVERYTHING that goes into my mouth. Sometimes I record something BEFORE I eat it to give myself a chance to decide if it’s worth the calories. Sometimes if something looks like it’ll eat up too much of my budget, I will just eat half and give the rest away. I feel like I have so much more control than I used to. And my coach helps me stay on track by texting me if she notices I haven’t logged in a while (like when I went on vacation). I don’t use the group support as much, but that’s because I’m more intrinsically motivated (Noom terms ftw!) and don’t need as much support from others. But I definitely need some pats on the back every now and then, and this app provides that. I highly suggest it!

Title: It’s working for me
----------------------------------------------------------
So, yeah...you can just count calories and exercise. You can totally lose weight for free. My problem is staying motivated, changing my lifestyle in a way that will KEEP the weight off, understanding my own brain and body so I can reach my goal and having a great support system during my journey. Noom does all of that. I’m over a month in and I’ve lost 6 lbs. It’s doesn’t sound like much but a) my clothes are starting to fit again b) that’s a very healthy and manageable weight loss amount for a month and c) I’m not really overweight, I just didn’t like how squeezy my pants were feeling and it was getting worse. The very bottom line with weight loss is you’re going to have to make changes to accomplish anything. If you’re sick of feeling uncomfortable in your own skin, you’re ready to make some life changes, and you need guidance and support on your journey, this app may be for you. Every day you’ll complete tasks such as reading articles, taking a quiz, logging weight, and logging your calories. About a week in you get assigned a goal specialist. Mine doesn’t really do much, to be honest. About 15 days in you are placed in a group with a coach. THIS has been awesome for me. The support and great ideas from others dealing with all the same obstacles has been great. I like how the weight log works...it’s very satisfying when the number has gone down and you get to tick, tick, tick over to the new number. I can see my progress on a graph. No foods are bad or off limits...foods are assigned a color and you get feedback and guidance on what percentage of your daily calorie budget should be in each color. You have a daily step goal which starts small but you can set it higher. There are recipes available that take your food budget into account. The articles are relevant, informative and amusing. The app is not perfect but it’s really working for me and I’m convinced I will reach my goal.

Title: Noom has given me a the only chance at a happiness and a more fulfilling life, period!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Before I heard about Noom I had been a 319 lb. shut in at a semi independent living apartment building in South Bend, Indiana. I was very depressed, and loosing any semblance of a desire to keep on living. My Mom texted me to look into this new thing she heard about called “Noom”. I thought “why not? I have nothing to lose.” I had been thinking of just ending my life at that time so many months ago, but the more I got into the Noom app, and talked with my personal coach both about my weight goals, eating habits, and my feeling about self harm. She instructed me to seal professional help, and gave me the number to the National Suicide Hotline, but still redirected my attention to my desire to make my life more fulfilling by having me think about how the Noom process is far more than one of those fasting/paleo expensive preplanned meal plan or overwhelming exercise apps. Noom is an instructional guide that relies on the empirical researched evidence about human behavior, psychology, sociology, dietary theory, and much more functionally laid out in a life habits changing regimen of knowledge put to practice with a personal coach as well as a group of other Noom members for a fully fledged support network throughout your journey. You will see your self esteem as well as your physical wellness improve ina matter of a couple weeks, snd then you see your life goals are possible as well as the possibility of gaining a physically satisfying weight level that will stay forever, and not reverse after 6 months. Noom is simply Great! I believe those who created the Noom app, and my personal coach & group members saved my life. I am truly greatful, and I hope other obese people who have lost hope will read this and give Noom a try. I can’t hurt to try Noom.

Title: Program seems great but App is not very savvy or user-friendly
----------------------------------------------------------
I like the program so far. It’s fun and instructive, and I’m optimistic it will be helpful. However, the apps on iPhone and iPad (there actually isn’t one, it’s just the lousy phone app) are not very sharp. They don’t tell you any of these things in advance, so I found them out in the run of things and then it was too late to avoid hassle, so hopefully this won’t happen to you. 1. You can’t do anything on a computer browser at all. 2. Your data / progress doesn’t sync between devices, which is fairly pathetic in this point of app standards. 3. I had to figure out some RIDICULOUS workarounds to be able to log my steps in the ipad version, because who takes their iPad on a walk to use it as a pedometer, especially if they didn’t tell us in advance?!  And because you can’t log steps manually. (I synced a third party app to the health app in my phone, and synced the same third party app to Noom on my iPad, and that app is savvy enough to share data across devices, so three steps removed gave me data entry on the iPad Noom app.) 4. It’s hard to type much in the iPhone app that is blown up bigger on the iPad, and there’s no reason they can’t just have an iPad app.  5. This app and program, like lots of them, is stuck in the gender binary and doesn’t give you a good option if you're trans, or any option if you are non-binary. This is rough when interacting with others in the app, in addition to being alienating when engaging it myself.  6. They ask if you have food allergies, but so far haven’t had any place to list them, and don’t let you list if you are vegetarian or vegan. Recipes don’t seem to be rated on these or other dietary restrictions. 7. There’s not really any kind of dashboard. You have to poke around to find where to do simple stuff.

Title: This really is different. It WORKS!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've spent most of my life struggling with weight and uncomfortable in my own skin. At one point I tried to go it alone. FitBit (with good dietary choices and regular exercise) helped me get down to 250 lbs from my heaviest at 425. That's all well and good, but the weight started to creep back on after a Christmas at the inlaws where all good eating habits and my exercise routine went out the window. The weight slowly and surely crept back until I was once again above 300, then around 350. I hung around 350 lbs for quite a long time, then the pandemic hit. Between the stress of moving for a new job (JUST prior to March 2020) and then being locked indoors for an indeterminate period of time, my weight shot right back up to my heaviest (plus a couple pounds) at 427. Once 2021 came along, I realized (again) that I HAD to take the weight off and keep it off. My BP and cholesterol were both elevated. My previous doctor, my mother, my new doctor, and multiple friends all mentioned Noom. I thought it was too good to be true, but if that many unconnected people mention something, well...maybe there was something to it. All that to say, the #NoomNerds are VERY up front about the fact that it isn't magic. It's PSYCHOLOGY. Well, whatever it is, it works. It's not about cutting out foods you love or grinding yourself to the bone with extra exercise-It's about being CONSCIOUS of the choices you make, why you make them, and giving you the tools to make healthier choices without feeling deprived of things you enjoy. You set your own realistic goals and pace.  It requires two things on your part...an open mind, and a belief that you CAN do this! If you're on the fence, just go for it. What have you got to lose (besides the weight)!

Title: Grateful for Noom
----------------------------------------------------------
Noom gave me the data and support I’ve always needed and never before had to get to my goal weight and maintain it. I had gotten to my goal weight once before, a few years ago, but it had been entirely through guesswork and the kind of eating and exercise levels that weren’t sustainable. I downloaded Noom in August, I lost 20 lbs in 2 months, and I now know how to keep it off. I found that the Noom system for logging meals and exercise gave me actual data and gave me a clear way to make decisions that would or would not support my goal. The weight loss part wasn’t fun but Noom gives you a lot of support. Weight loss/weight maintenance for me is more in my head than in my stomach — more about attitudes, habits, and my emotional relationship to food than anything else — and Noom is made for people like me. My counselor and I checked in regularly. He was very helpful and didn’t seem to mind when I whined and complained about the difficulties of losing pounds. If I have anything to suggest to improve Noom it would be to somehow simplify group interaction. Besides having an individual coach, you become part of a group with a group leader. I found it a little hard to understand how to take part in group discussions but ultimately I didn’t really need group interaction to get to my goal so, for me, it wasn’t a hindrance. I’m a guy in my mid-50s and since college — since the early 1980s! — I’ve fought an up and down battle with eating and weight. It’s a battle that has drained a lot of joy out of my life and now I finally feel like I’m in charge of this, I can choose and maintain my weight, I can feel great physically, and I don’t hate what I see in the mirror. Noom has changed my life and for that I’m very grateful.

Title: Joined by mistake
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been seeing these ads on Instagram and wasn’t in a place to think about a weight loss program. I decided to click on it. Then it asked me how much I’d pay to try it. I clicked $1. All of a sudden I had joined. I’m a skeptic. I thought, “well, probably won’t be any different from everything else I’ve tried...” I did the first day and logged my food and I was down 1 lb the next day. The second day I was starving and ready to give up. I even sent a chat to my coach, “How do people survive on this little?!”  The third day I got up and the message on Noom was so perfect and had the cutest message that validated how the first week is the hardest and to just keep going and you will succeed.  I had to laugh and show my family. Then I got a message from my coach about how I can increase my calories....wait, what??  Weight watchers doesn’t do that. Usually you’re supposed to stick with the calorie count you’re given!  I felt relieved. I increased my calories and now I’m able to meet my calorie goal every day. I’m down 7 lbs in 7 days and I’m seriously enthusiastic. I’m still skeptical. But my motivation is the curiosity of how the daily messages will keep me motivated. I love the psychology behind it!  They aren’t constantly talking about counting points or calories. It’s really just about logging your food. As you log, you are learning which foods are better for you, and you change your choices that way. I’m amazed. Last night there were goldfish crackers left on the counter my son left out in a bowl. I had 32 calories left. I ate 3 crackers and then drank some water and brushed my teeth. I NEVER do that!  I’m shocked with the will power that has developed from nowhere!  Just try it. It will amaze you!!

Title: Fantastic tool that requires individual commitment
----------------------------------------------------------
I officially reached my Noom goal today, losing 35 pounds within 12 weeks. I wouldn’t recommend that everyone else try to match that pace, but that is the beauty of this app. It provides a framework for each individual Noomer to establish their own weight loss goals and desired pace, then it guides them through the process of making good choices. Every day is then essentially a math problem, make your caloric intake < your caloric budget (derived from your starting weight, goal, and desired pace). The user inputs all the variables throughout the day and the app provides a constant accounting.  Splurge at lunch, skimp at dinner...or maybe take some laps around the park.  There are daily lessons that guide individuals to make healthy choices that will sate their appetites. There are lessons focused on exercise that can be tailored to each lifestyle, and that will earn some calories back toward the daily budget. There are lessons to help folks understand what the common challenges are and how to deal with them. There are individual and group coaching that provide avenues for individual concerns to be addressed, and for people who need a little cheering on...and commiseration, it ain’t a cakewalk...to get that. Best thing is that it does not prescribe a specific “diet” nor proscribe any unhealthy foods. It gives the Noomer the responsibility and capability to make their own choices. That’s the bottom line, though. It requires a committed user. There is work to this, just as with anything worth doing. And it isn’t a short haul, it has to be a lifelong commitment, but my coach is now preparing me for what comes next, and the app will continue to provide support for me as I continue on my healthy journey.

Title: Long time WW user switched to Noom
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m a long time WW user and recently switched to Noom.  I had great success with WW, but after maintaining for a couple years the weight was starting to creep back on and the program wasn’t working for me anymore.  I decided to give Noom a try and  am really liking it so far.  I’ve been on the program about 2 months and have lost 10 pounds.  The approach, like WW, is a lifestyle change not a diet, and teaches gradual changes you can make while still being realistic about what is a maintainable life habit both in the short and long term.  At first it felt like a lot, reading lessons every day (about 10 min, but you can also do less) and also weighing in every day which I was really averse to at first because of all the emotions tied to it.  But I’m really liking it.  The lessons are organized around themes so you learn bit by bit and the daily weigh ins really have helped with accepting that weight does fluctuate daily (water weight etc) so the emotional stakes are less but it does help keep you accountable.  I also really like the green/yellow/red volumetric calorie tracking approach much better than WW points.  It just makes more sense and doesn’t have these random secret reasons why one food with similar nutritional value has more points than another.  Another great thing that I like about Noom is you can set you desired weight loss speed (turtle, hare, cheetah) so it’ll give you a plan that is milder or more aggressive depending on what you want to commit to.  I chose the middle setting cheetah and have lost about 10 pounds in 2 months.  All in all Noom is a really sensible approach that teaches healthy lifestyle changes in an app that  is user friendly.

Title: $1 a Day...Totally Worth It
----------------------------------------------------------
I started my “free trial” one week ago and I’m happily surprised at how much progress I’ve made and how useful and different this program has been already. I’ve already changed how I am eating and exercising and I’ve learned a lot about myself and my relationship with food. The psychology piece has been really helpful and I think will help me maintain the changes I’m making. Customer service and coaching has been great so far, contrary to some other reviews I’ve read. They must have made some changes since those reviews were written. Sign up was easy, I’ve enjoyed the readings and have used and liked the recipes I’ve tried so far. Noom syncs great with my Health app for tracking my steps (I use Pedometer ++ and love it.) I haven’t been assigned to a group yet (starts after my 2 week trial period ends) but that seems like it will be another important piece to help me sustain the progress I’m making. I did order an “add on” (weekly personalized meal + workout plan) and didn’t find these particularly impressive or a good fit for me and was disappointed. BUT... I was amazed and delighted with the response I got when I asked for a refund. Refund given, NO QUESTIONS ASKED, and very courteous customer service representative. Noom has room to grow and improve but I am delighted with what is already offered and things I’ve learned about myself and eating and the progress I’ve already made (while still in the trial period!) Noom “gets me” and how my brain works with respect to food, exercise, habits. No guilt or shame at all. How freeing! I’m optimistic that Noom can give me the tools to create a new, more conscious and loving relationship with my physical self.

Title: Morbidly Obese
----------------------------------------------------------
I started this program at 351 lbs and am what is considered morbidly obese.  I hate that term but had to accept that, well, that was me.  But it wasn’t who or what I wanted to be.  I was very upset and unhappy that I had let myself get to that point of being overweight, tired, and unhealthy.  I was sick of it and because of it.  I had gotten to the point of not being able to exercise because of the strain on my joints.  I just kept getting bigger and I was ashamed.  Then I decided to try Noom.  This program is so easy to follow.  I’ve lost 16 pounds in my first month and am thrilled!  Nothing has ever worked because I’ve never learned to eat right.  Noom is so supportive and gives you the information you need to succeed and stay motivated.  And it’s fun!  I’m not bored or frustrated with this program at all and I don’t feel deprived.  Even if I get a little off track, I don’t get discouraged because they give me that nudge I need to get back on track. That being said, I don’t always communicate with my coach or group but that’s me.  Other people are supportive too, but I am just doing the food tracking, step count, and daily weigh in right now.  This is so easy, even with kids and a demanding job.  And I’m not working out like crazy.  In fact, I don’t always meet my step goal and I’m losing weight.  I plan to exercise more because my knees don’t hurt as much but I have at least have more energy, enough to clean, work, play with the kids and garden.  If you are like me and thinking there is no hope other than surgery like I was - please try this!  You will not be disappointed. It’s worth every penny!!!  Hope is not lost for us!  We can do this!

Title: NOOM has given me control again!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was quite hesitant to begin this new lifestyle, and that’s what this program becomes... a lifestyle of smart choices for a new and healthy way of eating.  I’ve been one of those yo-yo dieters all of my adult life, and every single time I go on a diet, I’ll lose weight, but I gain it all back plus usually 5 extra pounds.  I always felt out of control of my eating which would carry on into my everyday life.  When I would come home from work... hello bag of chips!  I had no regards for what I ate, how much or times I ate, I would munch all evening long...(hey, it’s a way of decompressing right)?  I knew I had no control over my eating...I didn’t want to fail AGAIN... but I saw a post my sister had made on FB with a picture of herself and her granddaughter and I noticed how much weight she had lost. I messaged her and asked what her secret weapon was and she told me it was NOOM.  I am now a NOOMER like my big sister! Is it expensive? I believe for what and how they work with you with support groups and coaches, it isn’t priced high at all.  It isn’t anymore expensive than some of the other weight loss programs out there.  NOOM is something I plan on doing from now on! I’m not doing this for anyone but ME. I’ve lost 11 pounds in about 5 weeks and I don’t feel deprived of anything. I love all the healthy recipes (which I’ve made several so far...), and they are quite yummy!  Please don’t hesitate to make the step into NOOMSVILLE.... it will be one of the smartest decisions you’ve made for yourself for a healthier lifestyle of smart choices, healthier eating and a healthier mindset! Don’t put it off!

Title: In Ain’t Over Til It’s Over
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been struggling with my weight for four decades. When I look back, each 10 years has some amount of success, but obviously nothing lasting. Now in my sixth decade, I had all but given up. The negative voices saying “you’re too old”, even my doctor saying, “it more difficult for the elderly to lose weight!” Then came Noom, a little app the could......make me BELIEVE that it is possible to rewrite those files, and silence the naysayers. No food is bad, just some is better. I’m learning new healthy habits that are overwriting the bad!  The people at Noom provide daily support with food logging, the latest dietary information, psychological insight to weight loss, and they teach you not to fear the scale!  They introduce you to like-minded people, all on a journey to better health. They provide coaches for the group and individually. So do I think all this is helping me? ABSOLUTELY! After nine weeks, I am eating healthier, sleeping better than I have in years, and exercising with energy I didn’t know I still had. I feel supported, and support others who all encourage and celebrate each other. And I know you are probably sitting there wondering “yes, but did you lose any weight?” I could leave you hanging by telling you I have actually gained more than I’ve lost by acquiring the tools and insight to really achieve good health, but that just seems cruel. So, drumroll please......I have lost 19 pounds! (Your weight loss may vary. You always see that in the fine print, so I thought I’d include it) Noom asked me to BELIEVE I could do it, and I did! It ain’t over til it’s over, and I’m doing it!

Title: Like Nothing I’ve Ever Tired
----------------------------------------------------------
Noom is exactly what I’ve been looking for! I know the basic principles of weight loss. I know what I need to be doing. But still I was stuck and losing weight for good seemed impossible. I tried WW three times, a personal trainer, two popular weight loss apps, and a mindful eating program that gave me “tricks” but didn’t help with lasting change. Noom is completely different. It uses psychology to change your thinking, and helps you break old habits, develop new ones, and prioritize your overall health. The program is incredibly informative, and the app is interactive and fun. In addition, you get a one on one coach, and you’re put into a group that also has a coach. There’s tons of support! It’s impressive and comprehensive, like nothing I’ve ever tried. I’ve lost 8.8 lbs in the first four weeks. I have more energy, I’m more focused, and I feel more relaxed and confident around food. Having self awareness and making good choices is becoming second nature. I don’t feel like I’m depriving myself, that losing weight is a struggle, or that my efforts will be unsustainable. Bonus, I feel the changes I’m making are making me better in other parts of life. I have a full time career, a husband, three teenagers and a thriving side business, and Noom fits nicely into my busy life. I know I’m going to lose the rest of the weight and keep it off thanks to this innovative program. I cannot recommend Noom enough!! I feel the best I’ve felt in a long time. If you’re ready to stop making excuses, and truly make changes to lose the weight, Noom is it!

Title: Get Ready to make changes
----------------------------------------------------------
As a mother of three and a full time special education teacher I don’t have time to kill. I need to know the information and I need to know why to do something. Noom does that. They cite articles they use acronyms they have nerd powers and they inform me how to lose this darn weight. I have lost over 5 pounds in one month. It may not seem like a lot but I’m no longer eating and ordering Willy nilly when I eat out. I have love for my body. I want to treat it right. I am making changes to my behavior that are going to last because I understand why i make the choices I was making. My elephant ( term used by Noom) was winning every evening. I was soooo hungry I would eat anything and everything. I learned that I need to plan my meals. I need to eat every so often so that I’m not trying to eat chips and dip as dinner and rather plan my meals. It’s so simple now that I’m living the Noom life. These small changes add up to weight lost. Changing behavior is not easy and there’s ups and downs but I’m ever so glad I’m on this Noom train. I’m on the journey of my life. Thank you Noom for making this program. Now about the app it’s user friendly it’s educational. Might want to add some videos to make it even more interactive. There’s a coach assigned to you and after 2 weeks you get assigned to a group. So you have support of the group and the coach. Noom makes you think!! They have excellent short articles that are based in research. And they give it to you straight with a big dallop of love. I currently can say Noom is changing my life.

Title: I love Noom!
----------------------------------------------------------
Wow! What can I say? Noom has been life changing for me! I just completed 4 1/2 months of Noom and am now at my goal weight, BUT Noom is SO much more than just about weight loss! I learned so much about “me” that I feel like Noom was a “counselor in an app”. I have grown so much as a person since starting Noom, that I now have the confidence to keep my weight off, something that I’ve never been able to do before. What I feel is that Noom equips you to make life changes. I loved everything about Noom, the daily funny short articles that were not just humorous but also thought-provoking. I loved the weight graph because it gave me a visualization of my weight loss. I loved logging my food and then being able to see an analysis of my choices and it kept me on track on how many calories I was consuming. And the pedometer to keep track of my steps was helpful too. Everything in one app! Plus the coaches and community of other Noomers to converse with helped with accountability. When I first joined Noom, I read a bunch of negative reviews, but I believe that those people who wrote the negative reviews didn’t give Noom a chance because I found Noom to be the most helpful weight loss tool that I’ve ever used! I’ve been a yo-yo dieter throughout my life (went on my first diet at age 17) and out of everything I’ve done over the years, this is the best! If you’re looking to lose weight, are serious to do your part, and follow the program like you’re supposed to, you WILL be successful! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Title: Worth every penny!
----------------------------------------------------------
I gained 10 lbs in two months after having minor elective foot surgery.  I have another month before walking restrictions are lifted.  I had to do something and thought I’d check Noom out.  I had never weighed daily or logged food and wasn’t happy about it.  I did it anyway.  The positive reinforcement and focus on nutrition with excellent guidelines keep me focused on my goal.  My goal is not to lose weight.  My goal is to climb a mountain that’s in my backyard.  It’s only a four mile hike but I see that mountain almost everyday and I thought it was impossible.  I’ve lost nine lbs in one month, 40 to go.  I am 65 and have arthritis in my knee that can be problematic so not positive I can climb the last 50 feet to the peak.  But I am confidant I can make it up there if I do a little uphill walking training and take it slow. I have eaten pretty much everything.  I am enjoying delicious food, sandwiches on Dave’s Killer bread, whole wheat pita with meat and veggie shish kabobs, homemade beef barley soup, I’ve had chocolates and cookies and gelato in moderation.  I switched to 1% milk in my lattes, I enjoyed a delicious burger 7% lean on whole wheat bun.  Skipped cheese and mayo and fries.  It’s not just salads, it’s mindful eating with a focus on why we choose food based on habits and environment.  Can’t say enough about how it’s helping me.  And yeah, I’m willing to pay a buck a day to get healthy and feel good about myself!  Less than the cost of one soda or candy bar.

Title: Noom Lives Up To The Hype
----------------------------------------------------------
This will be the first time I have ever reviewed an app, and I’m only doing it because an app is changing my life. Like most people, I’m super skeptical of the over-hyped and directed ads that promise all kinds of magical nonsense. But I decided, despite that skepticism, to try noom since they had a two week free trial. I mean, I had nothing to lose and I could prove to myself that this was just another weight loss fad that doesn’t work long term. Needless to say, I was completely wrong. Noom works. I should just stop there but you want to know more...noom works because it does the hard work of making you THINK and analyze and use both sides of your brain to figure out why you eat and what you eat and when you eat. It uses science and cheerleading and self-love tactics. Having all of this intel and support in your pocket ready any time you need it is a real game changer. There are no rules! You decide your journey and how to get there. When friends ask me how I’m losing weight, I laugh and say, “I’m eating donuts when I feel like it and I walk every day.” There’s no magic bullet and no short cuts. You won’t drop 15 lbs in a week, unless you are doing it wrong. But you will change your life forever if you are willing to be patient, open your mind and put in the time and introspection to figure out who you are and why you do what you do and who you want to be. This will be the last “weight loss” program that I will ever have to use and that’s just everything.

Title: Skeptical Now Convinced!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve tried south beach diet, low / no carb, myfitnesspal, C25K.... kept gaining weight and feeling really bad about it.  I got to a point where I said I need help- I need a coach or doctor and was considering one of those prepackaged food plans but didn’t because ultimately it’s not sustainable and I need to be able to live life with life’s temptations and keep weight off.  What’s very different about Noom is it is not a fad diet or exercise program.  It’s education.  You take a daily 10 minute course that feels like they’re reading your mind.  It talks to you about how to build healthy habits and how to not be so hard on yourself for slips.  Plus no food is bad food.  I can still have carbs, chocolate, etc but because of their cool color system that tracks the types of calories you’re eating, you can see how much of that item you can have.  I can fill up on veggies if I know I have a BBQ to go to that evening and still come in my goal calories.  The tracker does the work- I just add my foods.  I have a ton to learn but I’m looking at food differently and in a way that will be sustainable in life.  I also have support from a group that are all around the same lesson schedule as me, which helps.  I’ve been on Noom for about 1 month and have lost about 8 lbs- and that includes a couple slips.  Overall the weight goes up and down but the trend is going down so I’m very happy.  Highly recommend this approach over Keto or low carb.  It’s sustainable and healthy.

Title: Noom
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been using Noom for about a month. I eat mostly the same whole foods over and over so it is ridiculously easy for me to log my food which tracks my calories and shows me how many I have left and how much of it was veg etc. I enjoy the brief articles and their humor, they are a little goofy which is fun and the info is very simple and succinct and often interactive, gently psychological. After the first week or so of more interaction with her my goal specialist now checks in with me about once a week and asks me questions which help me think about things and stay engaged in my health journey. The team community coach posts a discussion topic I think every weekday and our little group of Noomers respond, like, and comment on each other’s posts. I think there’s a way to private message people but I haven’t needed to. I really look forward to the topics and people’s thoughts. I have lost a couple of pounds so far, which is great because what led me to do this was that I was slowly gaining and gaining! I’m enjoying Noom very much. I had a 2 week free intro and then figured it was worth another month. So far I think it has been worth the price, so I will probably continue for a while. I feel like I’m slowly making a shift to a person who will be thin. Other people are losing much faster because they are working out a lot, which I have not been, but Noom keeps me moving in the right direction. Little by little.

Title: NOOM has changed my life
----------------------------------------------------------
I was skeptical to start a program like NOOM because of the price and because I didn’t know if it would work for me. I have struggled with weight for most of my adult life and it has not been easy for me to lose weight. I am entering week nine in the NOOM program and have lost 12 pounds! While this may not seem like much, it is weight that I have not been able to lose on my own. I am a registered nurse and I feel that a slower, steady weight loss is a healthier way to go. I have seen many others in my life lose and then gain right back. The program has been so helpful in many ways. I like the fact that there’s really nothing that you can’t eat in the program, but more like how much you eat of it. The program breaks down for you the three levels of food and how much you should be eating in each of those categories. It has been more of a lifestyle change and making you aware of what you were actually eating. I really love the program. I think that it is really great to have a coach and a support team to reach out to 24 hours a day, and to also have recipes recommended by the program. I invited a friend to join the program as well and she really enjoyed it but she ended with her trial due to the pricing for her. I have a ways to go to meet my goal, but I am off to a great start thanks to NOOM! So I give this program five stars, but if it were just slightly less expensive, more people could benefit from it.

Title: Just Do It!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have never, ever written any kind of review before. But this program is life changing, so I had to! If you’re having doubts about trying “yet another weight loss program that probably won’t work,” stop doubting and just sign up! Noom is everything you hoped all those other programs claimed to be, and so much more! My husband and I have tried other “diets,” and after struggling with hunger pangs, finding the ingredients for, and cooking crazy, bland meals , we are so excited to find a program that is doable and easy to follow. Just like you, I had my doubts, but when my husband lost 10lbs, something he had never succeeded in doing on any other diet, I had to give it a try. I’m less than 5 weeks in and have lost 10lbs. I feel so much better about myself. I’m eating far more healthfully, and I’m shocked that I don’t crave all the junk I used to eat. I do treat myself at the end of almost every day, but I check to see if it’s in my calorie budget first. Instead of handfuls of mini Cadbury chocolate eggs. I’ll have a serving, which is 9. I savor each one and feel completely satisfied. I know you probably don’t believe me, and that’s okay. I only believe me because I live it! I’d like to tell everyone to sign up for this program, whether you need to lose weight or not! You will become your best healthful self. I hope I’ve convinced you, and wish you every success! And to my husband, I am forever grateful!

Title: So Far, So Good!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been with NOOM  for exactly 1 week today and I’ve lost 11 lbs. All I’ve done so far is log my meals, my liquids, and pay closer attention to my caloric intake and try to stay around the 2000 calorie mark. I’m not perfect. I have messed up by eating more than I should have, but NOOM is helping me hold myself accountable. By logging my meals, I have a visual of what I’ve been putting in my body. By watching my weight steadily decline on the graph, it’s boosted my self-esteem and that’s given me the encouragement to keep making good food and drink choices for myself. Having lived through other diet failures and having had surgery to lose weight, with no success, I was very skeptical about being successful with NOOM. I enjoy reading the article and I like that I can save them for future reference. I’m an addictions counselor and use the same psychological referencing from the S.M.A.R.T goals that NOOM offers, to lead my addictions clients, but I never thought about using S.M.A.R.T goals to help me lose weight. So far, I’m very happy with NOOM and how easy it is to use. With the Holiday season quickly approaching, I am excited to know I will be able to enjoy the eats and treats and not feel deprived because I have all the tools I need to recognize those triggers and help me psychologically break down my behaviors so I can combat my cravings. For me, it’s all about planning ahead and being prepared!

Title: I still eat pizza.
----------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I still eat pizza, peanut butter, bread and still drink wine. But logging all these foods in, which is quite easy (I do it by dictating to my iPhone) has shown me how much those foods affect my calorie intake and health. I’ve learned that I can still be happy eating those foods less often. I like that Noom does not necessarily exclude any food type or food group. But they definitely make you aware of the foods that will benefit you in weight loss. Noom is all about swapping out good things over less good things. It’s about figuring out how to avoid temptation by having the right foods around and the right frame of mind to deal with temptation. It’s about replacing good habits with less good habits. It’s about connecting things that you really like with things that you need to improve on in an effort to create a new and more beneficial habit. My morning ritual now includes a big cup of coffee and some quiet time reading my Noom articles, some area bit goofy but still fun to read and informative. I’m a much better eater now and it’s actually been fun making the transition. I’ve lost over 18 pounds over nine weeks, way more than I anticipated. For me it’s been 100% about looking at the food I eat every day and understanding how those foods affect your weight loss journey. It definitely takes dedication and a certain amount of concentration to make progress but I guess that’s what it’s all about.

Title: Accountability!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I wouldn’t say, as some reviewers did, that Noom has “changed my life.” However, I’m beginning my 6th week on the program and I am enjoying it. When I began, I was carrying around about 18 lbs that I just couldn’t seem to get rid of-and, truth be told, I was so frustrated during this pandemic that I began to gain even more weight. I am a lifetime member of WW from many years ago, so I KNEW the correct way to eat. I just couldn’t bring myself to want to be that strict. I’m 63 years old, and I used that as an excuse to just “let myself go.” I read the reviews with Noom and did their trial for 2 weeks which I liked so I joined for 3 mos. 5 weeks and down 8 lbs. I’m happy with the way it’s going.  So here’s the difference with Noom: unlike diets which have you purchase their specific foods, and unlike diet programs that only focus on food, the scale, and dropping weight, Noom is the first program I’ve seen and been involved in that focuses on BEHAVIOR. Why/How am I eating? So,yes, daily weigh in’s and exercise are part of the program. But I also get a virtual support group, a separate personal “coach,” and TONS of very helpful and informative articles which have really helped me with understanding my behaviors. I don’t want to just drop these last 10 lbs. I want to never diet again. I want to change my eating behaviors forever. This program has really done that for me! 😊😊

Title: Really helping me improve my relationship with food!
----------------------------------------------------------
I joined Noom because I was desperate. I’m tired of losing and gaining the same weight (and more) over and over. I’ve tried a lot of programs, and while losing weight is almost never an issue for me, keeping it off is. My eating habits were broken, and while I had success with WeightWatchers and MyFitnessPal, the former’s use of 0-point foods was no good for someone like me, who will overindulge on anything she feels she’s given license to, and the latter focused so much on calories, it sometimes made every food seem the same, so I would try to game the system to get as much food as I could and be scared of treats. Not good either. Noom is teaching me to listen to my hunger cues, think about nutrition, allow myself treats, and be more mindful about food in general. It is really helping! The weight is coming off, but more importantly, I feel my attitude and outlook on food changing, and I’m enjoying what I eat more instead of stressing about it. This gives me greater faith the weight will stay off. Two changes I wish they would make would be to allow people to log in advance, so we can strategize for big days, like holidays, and not to make it so after I log a meal, I have to go back into log another one; it’s a bit annoying to have to take extra steps when I’m logging. These are minor annoyances, though. Overall, I love Noom, and I’m ending Week 4 16 lbs down!

Title: Great program!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m just finishing my second week and despite taking it slow, I’m noticing a difference!  I’ve been carrying the extra weight from my youngest for the past 5 years now.  And the pandemic just added to it.  As well as now I have a work at home job on my computer all day!  It’s not exactly a recipe for success!  I knew I needed a change.  I knew I wasn’t gonna just do what I needed to do on my own.  I started to look into the Noom app and liked what I saw.  I committed to 6 months, and after 2 weeks I’m glad I did.  Paying for the program adds motivation to keep it up, but I’m seeing it working too!  Two weeks in and I’ve lost 3lbs!  Not much, but considering the first week I just kept track of what I ate and didn’t cut the calories like I was supposed to, I’m doing well!  Taking slow.  First week made me mindful of what and how much I was eating.  Second week I actually committed to the meal plan.  I stayed within my calories, and I’m not starving!  I plan for regular intervals for meals/snacks, and I’m making sure to have healthy options around.  I still have a ways to go.  I’m not even exercising yet!  But I’m already seeing this working!  Only thing I might suggest is a full list of foods and where they rank and where they fit on the meal plan.  So we have something to reference, and maybe get ideas from.  Otherwise I’m happy with the program and the app!

Title: BEST Program, EASY to use!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried ALL the other weight loss programs out there, I LOVE THIS ONE!! I always went back up in weight after being off the other programs, but this is TOTALLY DIFFERENT! I am having such GREAT success in this program! NOOM teaches me a totally new way to lose weight & keep it off! I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER! Thank you all @ NOOM for changing my life. It’s been a real life changer for me and I highly recommend this to everyone who hasn’t had success in the past. It has taught me so much more than just losing weight, I have learned about how to combat my weaknesses and change my way of thinking. This is so much more than a weight loss program, it has taught me about myself, my habits and how to change them. I have the Apple Watch 6 and it syncs perfectly all of my health data. I can go back and see the weeks that I lost the most weight, and what I ate, how active I was to compare the days. I haven’t used the free coaching, but I definitely will if I hit a weight loss plateau as I had on all the other diets I have tried. I love the reminders you can set, the short daily lessons, and how EASY it is to log daily info. I love the reminders they give me! It keeps me motivated and for the 1st time ever I don’t dread weighing myself! (BIG SIGH!) For what you get, this program is BEYOND worth the price! I am hitting my goals & couldn’t be happier! THANK YOU NOOM!!

Title: Noom changed me for the best me ever
----------------------------------------------------------
I heard about Noom from a friend and then seen lots of commercials on tv. I just started a new job and knew that my old routine was going away. My life was going great and then I decided what the heck go big or go home. I added Noom a week after I started my new job about 2 and 1/2 months ago. I am down 15 pounds and I feel amazing. I always hated the word diet and I have to say this really is not a diet. I don’t have to get rid of the stuff I love to get healthy. This app has taught me so much from being mindful of everything. I love that it teaches you so much and how to make the best decisions that work for you! The only recommendation I would have for Noom is consider having a call with your new members to show them how to best navigate through the app. I know that if I had something like that in the beginning it would of helped start my journey much more smoothly! I can seen that would be a reason someone doesn’t stick with the app if they are not as motivated. You really have a life changing solution however not everyone is tech savvy and may get discouraged if they don’t figure it out! That is a true shame as my life has changed for the best me ever and everyone looking for that deserves it. Don’t let your members get frustrated early then your program will end up being something everyone uses! Thank you so much for what you have done for me 🙂

Title: Call me hopeful!
----------------------------------------------------------
Started Noom a little over a month ago and have lost 10 pounds. But that’s not why I’m hopeful.  I’m not a yo-yo dieter. I’m 70 years old and while I’ve tried various things over the years, my go to has always been WW. I had gained weight when raising my children and somehow those pounds never really went away and no matter what - my weight remained stubbornly too high for my height and certainly for my health. WW with its focus on points was not really working for me. I’m a “basically” healthful eater but the point system somehow let me “get away with” my poor portion control. While Noom assigns foods into categories (like WW and other diets) to help you make choices, it’s daily focus is portion control (along with multiple other factors of course, i.e. excercise) because you watch the calories add up. Calories - not points. That feels more intuitive for me. Also, listening to the multiple, psychologically based, lessons a day keeps my intention up front and center. A form of mindfulness as it were. I’m a psychologist. What I’m hearing is already familiar. But HEARING it in a pleasant, informative and sometimes humorous way is incredibly helpful and actually enjoyable. I’m primarily an auditory learner. This works beautifully for me. I start listening in the a.m. while getting ready for work and log in periodically through the day.

I am delighted with Noom. I started on the trial basis, but saw results within the first week. My efforts to control my weight for the last few years had not gotten me anywhere. Noom is a system that allows for all the types of food you like, just not as much and not as often as will cripple efforts for weight control. The app is easy to use, and the daily encouragements are at times corny, but are fun and help to keep me on track. Noom uses what they call “Psych Tricks” to educate and encourage a healthier eating lifestyle. I’m extremely glad I tried it. After a month, I’ve lost 9.5lbs, my clothes are looser, and I’m looking forward to wearing my pretty clothes again after a few more months on the program. I tend to respond well to programs with step-by-step instructions. Logging in my food isn’t a chore, but an interesting challenge to put together a day’s meals. I’ve even allowed myself my favorite cookies, (not every day and not half the package) which I no longer consider “food crack” because I can enjoy them without overdoing. I got a thermos to take soup to lunch, and have experimented with new recipes that are something to look forward to at mealtime. After years of failed attempts to get the weight off, the community of Noom offers a system that works, support and humor, and a way to start feeling like my real self again.

Title: Noom
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been on NOOM for a month.  I’m 65 Yrs old. I’ve been overweight my entire life. I thought I would hate logging everything I ate. That practice has been surprisingly easy AND made me realize how much mindless eating I was doing.  I would tell myself a few chips are okay to eat. That it is, according to NOOM. Then I saw the the number of calories I was racking up by mindlessly grazing all day long.  Seeing this, I’ve been able to slowly start changing my habits. Now that I’ve started grazing on healthier foods, my cravings are starting to diminish.  I still enjoy chips and chocolate. Who wouldn’t?  Just not in the quantities I have in the past. I have been sorely tempted to give up during the past month, due to daily logging results.  NOOM’s tips helped me to push past that. I now see my weight graph with many hills and valleys, but an overall downward trajectory! The articles are fun. I never read more than five minutes in a day and just read when I need additional encouragement. The coach has been able to give me good suggestions for my snacks when I got bored with fruit. I don’t  exercise and have a sedentary job, so the weight has been slow in coming off.  With the few pounds I’ve lost, I am finding it easier to get up the stairs and pain from osteoarthritis in my knees is diminishing. Thanks for the support, NOOM.

Title: It WORKS
----------------------------------------------------------
If you are willing to commit and put in the work, this is definitely the best app to help you achieve your goals! I initially had no faith in myself that I would lose any weight at all, but the way they set up their articles to educate you on how to live a healthier lifestyle is encouraging and inspiring and if you are willing to receive all the “tools” they give you to succeed you definitely will!!! I recommend this to everyone who has asked me what I’ve been doing to lose weight! I started the program 3 1/2 months ago and I’m down 30 lbs and pushing closer to 35....10 lbs a month of healthy weight loss!! I’m a registered nurse and I thought I knew a lot about nutrition and what’s good and bad, but I’m not a nutritionist so I found out I was wrong about a lot of things about healthy eating. Starting this journey has honestly been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made!!! I feel so much healthier and more energetic, and I still have more weight I’d like to lose, so I’m gonna continue with this new lifestyle change bc it’s just that....it’s not a diet... it’s a new way of thinking about food and exercise and your body as a whole! LOVE THIS APP MILLION! I will be sad to end my journey and fly solo, but when that day happens I know they have given me so many things to help me continue on my own!!!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Title: Best ever!
----------------------------------------------------------
When I first signed up for Noom I thought well if nothing else I can get my money back. But I love it! I am in week 5 and down 14 lbs. I have crohns so it is really hard to stick to a healthy diet. I can’t eat whole grains. But Noom has taught me that I can eat what works for me. I found a good white bread with less calories. The reading each day was helpful because it is broke down to small bites to mentally digest! Then they will go over it again to make sure you understand. My goal specialist is great. I was having a craving for peanut butter cup. She told me to have it but I needed to find a away to do it while staying in my calorie budget. It took me a couple days but by planning for my special treat I made it work. She also checked back to see if it worked. Then she told me don’t label a food as I can never have it to I can have it however I gotta make it work in budget.  Also they have a different way of looking at your food. My group is a very active group sharing our daily goals. I love Noom and had people ask what I am doing. I smile and tell them I am a noomer! Then I explain it. It hasn’t just changed my eating lifestyle but I feel my whole body, mind and soul changing. I don’t hurt as much. I now go to the gym. I am no longer a slug when I get home from work. Thank you Noom nerds, your the best!

Title: If you want success!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried many diets. I would say that I don’t even consider this a diet but it does affect the way that I eat. There are so many little tidbits of information that help me throughout the day. And even more importantly I have had 1:1 assistance with some virtual cheerleading and direction, a coach, who has directed me toward articles to read and such, to lift myself up. Each day, the lessons, come with practical things - like weighing daily (which I always was told weekly), shopping in the morning for food cuz of decisions process is affected as day goes on... all have encouraged and made me excited about what I am doing. I don’t remember which day I started - I think it was about a week ago. I have lost 12 lbs. I know it is fluid mostly but choosing food that fills me up better is also part of that. Understanding the “psychology” behind things has helped. I have not been perfect at following a regimen but i have got on all the goals set and accomplished many already, which in and of itself motivates. I think this is really gonna work cuz I don’t have to give up stuff - really. I been making exchanges and that has satisfied. Love this and can’t wait to see if I can make it to my goal weight. I know the weight loss will slow down soon - but I am still at a wonder at how I don’t feel deprived. Loving NOOM!

Title: Good ideas but execution is lacking
----------------------------------------------------------
I enjoyed some aspects of this ap.  The articles and quizzes were interesting and informative. However, the coaching and other aspects were lacking.   I’m not sure if my coach was a real person or just computer generated responses to my comments.  All “her” comments were pretty bland and generic.  In addition, you are apparently supposed to be placed in a group with other Noom members for support which I never was.  When I asked about the group 6 weeks later I was put into a “quiet group” with others who also had never been put into an “active group,” had cancelled membership (me) or out there for a few other reasons. I kinda felt like I was in trouble for no reason.  Several of us asked to be put into an active group so we could see if this made a difference in our ap experience but, no response after 48 hours.  I am also in agreement with others that the food logging is lacking. After a somewhat timely process of entering a few “meals” they didn’t show up in my food for the day nor did it recall my “meal” the following week.  Lastly, I really wanted to concentrate on toning and building muscle and not as much on losing weight.  Although I listed this in my goals there was no way to track this nor was this ever brought up by my coach.  This is not a cheap ap at $49/month.  Definitely not worth it to me.

Title: Worth every penny!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is my first time I’ve ever written a review for a product. Unfortunately, I have to delete the app due to personal financial constraints but before I left I wanted to leave this. I started this journey because I could feel and see how a years worth of being quarantined had changed my body. At that time, I was 5’5” and 154lbs and felt uncomfortable in my body and down right sad that I had gained so much weight (I was 138lbs before). I had tried multiple other cheaper or free weight loss apps. I’d lose a few pounds and then gain it right back. I finally made the decision to just pay for Noom and try it at least for a month. I’m so glad I did! I’ve done it for over 3 month now. It has helped me lose 15lbs and keep it off. I have better judgment on what foods I should reach for and how much to eat. It made me set realistic goals and not feel guilty about eating a cookie (or two) during my day. I even got a few of my coworkers to try it and they loved it! Even though I’m leaving Noom, I feel better prepared to “go at this alone”. If you’re laying in bed or the couch right now, scrolling through reviews because you’re on the fence about paying that much for an app, take my advice and just try it for a month! Just don’t order that $40 worth unnecessary stuff off Amazon this month or eat out one less time!

Title: A real review, from someone who rarely posts reviews
----------------------------------------------------------
Simply put: I was a total skeptic, as my experience of these things is that they are both expensive and rarely work. Big surprise: Noom really does work. I’ve been on it for about 6 weeks and have already lost 5 pounds, and it has never felt like a chore, a burden. or a project. And this occurred with my 50th birthday AND Thanksgiving in the middle, folks. Wow. Just gradual, natural, and healthy. I’ve formed new and better eating habits, am far better at balancing the types of food I eat, and have gotten past several (inevitable) low periods with the help of my coach and Noom’s cognitive behavior-changing content - which is really fun and life-affirming to read, I promise you. Best moment: when I asked the coach if I could slip in a dose of my favorite French toast every so often and she replied, “Are you kidding? Of course! It’s all about moderation!” It’s lovely to hear that from someone other than myself - and I enjoyed every bite, and then went right back to my regular habits. Didn’t have any regrets, didn’t start craving more. Bottom line: most apps/plans target only one or two pieces of the puzzle. Noom is an end-to-end strategy put into practice, that really helps you learn how to become healthier - while enjoying it! I rarely write reviews, but these guys deserve a great one. Thanks, Noom!

Title: Believe
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m so impressed with the Noom program. It’s the best program I have ever used. I truly BELIEVE I will achieve success. No matter whether I meet my idea weight loss goal of 45 lbs or not. What I’m learning as a Noomer will change my life and health for the better. The technique of using psychology to relearn your personal relationship with food and building a positive foundation of a balance of physical activity and more thoughtful food choices is a win win situation. The tools suggested to manage stress and to try and understand why we make the choices we make about eating is so helpful. The coaches are phenomenal in their enlightened , experienced suggests and they are wonderful cheerleaders! I just completed my first level and although it’s a slow and steady journey... the great thing is .. NOOM teaches a SUSTAINABLE situation of weight loss. No YO-Yo stuff here. As a new NOOMER... just Believe it can be done. Keep your mind set on your BIG PICTURE, and know the longest of journeys begins with taking the first step. Perfection is not required! Just keep positive and get back up and be kind to yourself when you feel you have failed.. we are only human. Noom can help you become the best version of your human self! 😃. Thanks NOOM and much thanks to my awesome coach Valerie. Linda Marriott.

Title: Game changer
----------------------------------------------------------
I came to the realization that my weight struggles were emotional/psychological. I’m a smart girl that was in great shape for most of my life and then changed my lifestyle. These changes resulted in a roughly 50 pound weight gain that I tried to address for ten years. Everything I started to do to lose this weight,I’d give up on 3 weeks in. I kept seeing the NOOM ads on Instagram and even took the questionnaire once, only to not commit by plunking down money. I just figured it was yet another attempt I’d fail at. But the ads kept popping up...and they never annoyed me. The one video with a girl easily zipping up her jeans really got to me. I have so many cool jeans just sitting and rotting in a drawer.  My self esteem had never been lower and it affected EVERYTHING in my life. My back hurt. My fingers ached. Finally I just signed up one day. I told my husband something like ‘I have a feeling this might help me’.  And it has. Tremendously. I went head straight into doing NOOM in a perfectly imperfect way. I just can’t say enough about my experience with this little app. I do think you have to want to dive in, get deeply honest and go through being a little discombobulated till you carve out a new lifestyle. That’s exactly what I’m determined to do.  Highly HIGHLY recommend.

Title: Yes, this really works.
----------------------------------------------------------
I started this app in December, after trying to track my calories with the My Fitness Pal app.  But I needed more than just tracking calories. This app changes your relationship with exercise and food. If you commit to it you will lose weight. Each person is different, for me personally - it was primarily portion control. I understand now why I couldn’t lose weight, I was eating more calories than I was burning every day. That statement sounds very simplistic, but I understand why now. I ate a lot of the right foods, but not enough. Noom teaches you how to choose whats right for you in every situation. The combination of the daily exercises, tracking food, tracking exercise, the support network of your group, and your coach all culminate into teaching you how to lose weight and keep it off. Sometimes the daily exercises don’t pertain to your situation, so you can glide through those exercises. But when you realize the exercises that pertain to you? It just clicks. You realize ‘this is the issue I have...  I understand what I need to do to rev up my metabolism and lose this weight.’  I joined for a year, I decided to give myself a year to slowly lose this weight and keep it off. I’ll be at my goal weight of 130 pounds by November, I have no doubt.   This really works.

Title: When you are ready to change your life... start here
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve tried everything to lose weight short of surgery,having my mouth wired shut, or a tapeworm. I was honestly checking into surgery  when a friend of mine said “try Noom”.   I said no.  I told her I was tried  of stuff ... A month had  passed and I saw her again...Again she said “try Noom”.  My answer ...no.  Late one night I turned on my tv and there was Noom. Be careful what you pray for lol.  So, I got on the app. They asked A LOT of questions, I answered as truthfully  as possible and I’m not gonna lie it was causing a bit of anxiety ... thinking I was going to have to change, no more eating out “normally” no more cup cakes (my favorites ) so many no’s in exchange for a smaller dress size.  Was it worth it? Could I do it???   Now that I’m doing it I’ve come to learn those are the lies that hold us back, that keep us from the freedom we (those of us who struggle) deeply crave.  The information , the personal help, the group chat, achieving a small goals is exciting.  Other things have been happening... I’m happier I do have more energy my skin looks better and I’ve actually saved money !!! That’s right and a lot of it by not eating out or grabbing on the go.  If you’re ready and like they say you believe that you can then try Noom.  You won’t be sorry😉

Title: Unbelievable!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am 70 years old.  I have struggled with, but not been bothered by weight for a long time.  I was okay buying larger clothes and being comfortable.  Back at the end of January, I had a doctor’s checkup.  My A1c was 10.4 and my blood pressure was sky high.  I looked at the NOOM information on line and decided to take the plunge.  I set a goal of losing 60 lbs. ( NOOM set my goal at 27).  I started off, got everything set up to do on the app and dove into the plan.  I followed the daily information, charted weight, glucose, BP and all my consumption information.  I was doing really well.  I started losing steadily, while enjoying 6 eating events a day, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and never going to bed hungry.  The pandemic hit, right?  I was doing little exercise and despite all the at home time, continued to lose.  In May, I returned to the doctor and my blood pressure was steadily low, blood glucose hovered at 100 and my A1c had gone down to 5.7.  I continue on the program and feel healthy, have lost 52 lbs., and have a new mindset and a better outlook on life.  I thank NOOM.  You DO have to sacrifice, but I have found more than adequate replacements.  If you’re serious, it’s worth the effort, even for an old coot like me.  Try it and good luck!

Title: Took the plunge
----------------------------------------------------------
I had lost weight before and thought I knew how to do it, having gained it all back again. I kept at my previous menu, not realizing that it was written for the Me I was when I was doing all the workouts and needed to maintain the weight I was at. So wouldn’t you know, the scale would never say anything different and I just thought it might be the age playing into my non-budging scale. I half-assedly got on Noom and it did seem pricey at first but you have to realize that it is to keep you accountable. And I needed someone to keep me accountable. The texts are written in a fun, upbeat manner, with a lot of challenges and pop quizzes #NoomNerdslovepopquizzes) and there is a forum for a small group of other Noom participants to share on. Some people are definitely not comfortable doing it because I only see a handful of people who write in the forum all the time. But when people share, it seems to really have an impact. My personal story is a little heavy (pun intended) and people started to share and really get deep. It was a bit cathartic. There is also someone assigned to you who personally takes you through your journey and checks in weekly. At the end of the day, you are investing in yourself so you can decide if you and your health are worth it.

Title: Noom is Lifechanging
----------------------------------------------------------
I started Noom 19 weeks ago not really knowing what to expect.   To say I am extremely thankful to The Noom creators would be an understatement.  I have met my goal weight of losing 30 lbs but the best thing I can share is that while they had me looking at what I was doing to gain weight and how I was going to react to unexpected moments of food, they helped me look at other aspects of my life to the why I was doing what I did.   Pre-NOOM, I was having anxiety attacks and blood sugar surges.  Now I haven’t had any attacks since I began the program and the blood sugar surges are non existent.    Noom helped me face some inner issues and learn how to handle everyday stresses that would cause me to mindlessly eat.   I would highly recommend the Noom program and urge you to be active in discussions and sharing the ups and downs of your journey.   Don’t be discouraged if you have a minor weight gain, just acknowledge it and move forward with the knowledge that it’s ok.   It happens even in the best of times.  I also loved that I could eat anything as long as I was careful to count it in my calories.   I feel the best I have felt in 19 years because I am not I overweight.   Noom has been a phenomenal tool for me!  I am now a Skilled Master Noomie!

Title: “This time will be different!”
----------------------------------------------------------
I normally do not write reviews but after starting NOOM there was no way I could resist spreading the word about how great this program is! I have tried everything under the sun to lose weight(weight loss pills, meal prep, multiple types of dieting, etc.) and I could NOT lose the weight and keep it off. With NOOM I have finally found a custom plan specifically for me that is genuinely helping me lose weight. Although my journey has just begun in one weeks time I have lost 9lbs since my first weigh in! This. Is. Working. The psychology behind over-eating, the calorie budget, the courses; I can go on and on about all of the great ways NOOM has completely turned my eating habits upside down and how I am actually loosing weight. I am thoroughly optimistic that by the end of this program I will not only  have reached my target weight but I will have achieved a complete lifestyle change! I implore anyone reading my review: If you have struggled like I have for YEARS trying to lose weight, if you are tired of yo-yo dieting and not being able to keep the weight off, please choose NOOM. I am not a spokesperson and you may have heard some of these claims with other products or programs but this is real. Good luck! I’ll keep you posted on my progress!

Title: Life Changing! Worth every penny!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I started Noom in June of 2019, weighing 165 lbs and wanting to get in shape after recovering from ACL surgery and knew it would be easier if I were thinner. But isn’t that to story of my life. Everything would be easier if I were less heavy. I could move easier, fit in to more clothes and wear what I wanted. Those were things I’ve wanted for years. I’ve been a little overweight since I was about 13 years old. Always about 20/30 lbs more than where I needed to be. I even had someone ask me once when I was in my 20s if I was pregnant, I nearly died. I’ve tried Nutrisystem and Weight Watchers, fad shakes and everything that I could find, but nothing really worked. Until Noom. I learned about my relationship with food. I learned about what I was choosing to eat and why. It changed my entire view about what I can eat and when I should eat it and why I should it. I lost 30 lbs and met my goal in four months. When my subscription automatically renewed, I emailed and asked for a refund, which they provided immediately. I’m now at 135 and maintaining my weight right where I want it to be using the tools I got with Noom. If you are even thinking about wanting to lose weight and change your life, don’t wait! Do it. This is a great program!!

Title: Life changing!
----------------------------------------------------------
I will start off by honestly saying, yes, this app has it’s issues. That said, I’ve lost over 10 lbs in just 4 weeks and I look and feel better than I have in years! I’m currently wearing a pair of jeans that look brand new but they are over 5 years old because I haven’t been able to fit into them until now! Don’t listen to the negative comments. Those are from people who don’t need to lose weight or are not seriously trying to. I would never in a thousand years diet, but this program is so simple it’s not like dieting at all! No food is “bad” or off limits, instead I’ve learned to master what I eat instead of it controlling my thoughts. I still eat at McDonald’s and Wendy’s and even enjoy a full sugar dessert if I want. It’s all about budgeting your calories each day to make it fit. I never feel hungry. In fact, I’m honestly not as hungry as I was before I started Noom and I enjoy eating now more than I have in years!! If you have always wanted a smaller, healthier you, there is nothing out there like this program to get you there with the minimalistic amount of hassle, I promise you! Stop waiting! You get two weeks free and if you find me on Facebook and msg me, I will send you a link so you can get it for less than $20 a month!

Title: Really like this program!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am really enjoying this program!  I do believe (after 4 weeks of putting this into practice) that I am on the way to changing my eating habits.  The science of what we eat, why we eat, when we eat, how we eat is put into easy to read (and easily digested 😉) short articles.  There is online group support as well as an individual goal coach.  You are challenged to try something new, whether it be a form of exercise, a new food, or mostly, the way you think about food.  Logging your food is easy and informative.  Calories are counted but the major focus is on what fuels your body and leaves you satisfied.  Noom synchs with my Fitbit and counts my steps.  I would have given it a 5, but there are a few things that could be improved a little (had trouble at first with synching my Fitbit, group “threads” are sometimes hard to follow - probably more to do with us not understanding exactly how a thread works - the ability to copy and paste a recipe from another site to determine how this enters into the food log.  I have lost about 8 of the 30 pounds I plan to lose.  I list this benefit last because, even though my original goal was to lose weight, I think the greatest benefit is how it has changed my thinking and eating.

Title: 30 days Noomin’
----------------------------------------------------------
Not a diet - change in attitude and awareness. I’ve been Noomin’ for 30 days and I reached my 10 pound loss today. I started applying simple concepts from day 1: eat food with more water, feel less hungry. I was on a keto/paleo diet for the past 4 years and really stalled. Not gaining as much much not loosing either. I feel like I enjoy eating again. The more I exercise, the more calories I can eat - talk about positive reinforcement! Who knew women underestimate calorie intake by > 500/day? When I started weighing food I could ask myself, “Do I really need to eat this portion size?” After my soup appetizer (water dense food!!), my portion sizes dropped because I just wasn’t as hungry. No off limits food - I eat fruit all the time (green food!) and love it! I made myself involve completely in the program. I read my group chat and learned from my group, offer advise to others. I think the number one thing that makes this work is the program keeps me mindful- aware of my goal, tells me before I slip that I need to expect that and move on - it’s about the big picture. When I weigh in every day, it reminds me of my health goal. The lesson give me the “why” and “how”. One new goal per week is easy - anyone can do it.

Title: My First Week
----------------------------------------------------------
As many, I’m a skeptic of these type of programs.  Before selecting a program, I did google searches for the “best weight loss programs” and Noom seemed to have the best results by far.  I took the chance as I figured it was affordable enough and after getting weighed in at my Dr.’s office, I’m a little panicked.  I was officially the heaviest of my life and I could tell.  I’m totally type “A”, so following the program is not an issue.  My first week, I’ve dropped from 139.5lbs to 127.1.  I bought a newer scale, an Ozeri, which I love, because I believed my much cheaper scale was not working correctly.  It was, I’m losing weight fast this first week.  I’ve changed how I eat and I’m also doing light workouts daily on different muscle groups.  I’m also conscious of meeting my step goals each day.  In conclusion, I plan to stick with this.  I have an end weight goal of 185lbs, but time will tell.  I’ll say that I’m not as skeptical now.  Maybe my weight loss will slow down or maybe this isn’t typical.  Either way, I’m living much healthier than I was and I feel better than I did.  That’s a win no matter how you slice it.  Thanks for reading and good luck to you if you are in the hunt for a way to get healthier.

Title: One of the best choices I have made
----------------------------------------------------------
I read through some of the reviews and I agree with all of them. What’s interesting though is that while they say basically the same thing Noom is very personal. On the groups that you have access to you can share your experiences and see others. I have been on Noom for about 2 months now and am just shy of a 30 pound loss. That journey so far has been deeply personal and reflective for me, while it seems other people are less reflective and more about following a plan. Here’s the thing, both will work! I think that is the best part of Noom. It speaks to each person in a different or similar way but still gets at the core of how to re adjust how you think about food. What I love most is having the daily lessons. I treat them like a class I am taking and find the daily cadence makes a difference. I am always aware of food in my day. I was a “fog” eater and have been able to stop the behavior because I have daily reminders to watch for it. I am in my 50’s and wish I had had this in my 20’s as weight has always been a challenge for me! I hope if you read this and decide to give it a try, really dedicate yourself for at least the first 30 days! And I hope you find the same success I have had!

Title: I am so impressed (one suggestion!!!)
----------------------------------------------------------
Let me start off by saying that I do not usually take the time to leave reviews, and I am a WW Lifetime member. I just found that the more I grew in life and nutrition knowledge, the less I wanted to look at food as points and not food. It began to feel like an energy leak to always be counting points. Enter Noom - I don’t “diet” and at first the idea of counting calories felt like it could be a diet. Or punishment. Lol. But - it’s not at all. As a therapist, I love love the daily lessons and the behavioral modifications and mental resilience that Noom teaches. I don’t at all feel deprived, this is no my fitness pal! And I actually am realizing I was underrating often. There is no GOOD or BAD food, and nothing is off limits - but Noom helps you make better choices by saying, “you can have the red foods - they simply aren’t the best choices. So, limit them. Or not. Just know the difference.” It feels compassionate, and it’s funny, and I love having accountability. Someone to reach out to and say, I am really having trouble getting my water in. Can you help me? I just feel like I found something that is going to finally FEEL amazing, which is ultimately what will lead me to release Weight.

Title: Lost 20 pounds in 51 days!
----------------------------------------------------------
I don’t exercise. For decades I’ve eaten whatever I want. So for 10+ years I’ve hovered near 300 pounds. I’ve got bad asthma, a bad back, and now MS. The thought of aerobic exercise - ehhh I don’t think I can do it. But come to find out I don’t usually overeat (occasionally I down a whole bag of chips bc who doesn’t?) but I just ate the wrong things. Noom has shown me how to be mindful of what I eat and there’s been very little change to my diet (most days I need to force myself to eat MORE to make sure I’m getting enough calories!).  Swapped my honey nut bread for a low cal bread which I like more. Swapped bacon for a chicken bacon which I actually like more. Added more broth-based soups. Found healthier versions of snacks I like. Noom provided me a private coach who checks in with me weekly and a group of fellow Noom-ers who are part of a cohort cheering me on, sharing successes, failures, and tips. Could I have done all this without Noom?  Yes. Did I?  Nope. Noom is helping me stay on track and motivated while giving me the tools to be successful. As someone who used to eat rocky road ice cream every night and hasn’t had it or really missed it in 51 days - I give the credit to Noom.

Title: I’ll Never Try Anything Else!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was inspired to try Noom after being on antidepressants for a couple of months had lifted the veil enough for me to maybe try something new maybe hopefully… I’ve lost 25 pounds in 6 months and about 5 inches probably off my stomach. I can almost see where my abs should be! Noom has also encouraged me to start working out! And this is the first time that’s ever stuck!! I REALLY love Noom because there’s no guilt to the weight loss. That’s REALLY what’s made the lessons stick for me. You can go at your own pace, and no one yells at you to go faster or tell you that you’re not trying hard enough. My coach Portia is fantastic about checking in one a week or so, just to ask me if I’ve run into any questions or how I feel like things are going — and that’s IT! No guilt, no shame, no comparisons, just gosh dang support. Noom explores the psychology being weight loss, and the more important lifestyle changes behind them. And they like actually explain it, very clearly and kindly. Yeah okay, all of the #NoomNerd stuff is kinda #annoying, and I’m even a millennial lol. But no one penalizes you if you don’t read every week! Or if you don’t log a couple things for a couple days…or a few days!

Title: Works but is insulting to seniors in many ways and also to the physically challenged.
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a good app for weight loss. Most of the info isn’t new but it’s very well presented and is easy to remember.  The app however is meant for the younger generations.  There is one question which asks about which decade of age you are.  It cuts off after 60.  Not bad in itself. But it also just assumes that you can walk 10,000 steps a day, because nobody has arthritis or COPD right?  I just read a  bit of peppy advice  that said the changes made here will last a lifetime and that’s “a long time”!   Well Probably not for me.  It’s pretty clear that I am not in Noom’s intended group of clients (although it initially assured me that it has helped 70 year olds before). I wonder if their research included boomers. So I’m proceeding with caution.  I don’t need to be reminded that I’m old, and not as capable as I once was when I’m losing weight.  However,  it does keep reminding me that I’ve leaned more than I thought I did.  Overall it’s a great app if you are younger than say 55 or 60 or are not tired of agism already.  The info is useful and arranged in a logical an easy to remember fashion, but the writing seems shallow and overly commercial, considering the way it was advertised.

Title: Whether you think you can or can’t, you’re right!
----------------------------------------------------------
The Noom process works but only as good as I allowed it to be. I am the captain of my life.  Noom provides some education, tools, encouragement and fun,  that are very effective in helping to clean up my habits and improve my health. It is an interesting journey and one of the benefits of it all is I lost weight. My weight loss was steady with ups and downs.fast.  All my doing or my undoing. But with the direction and understanding of Noom it was a positive experience.  I do not have a membership right now.  I set a goal to lose 16 lbs because I was on a plateau and lost 10lbs in 3 months.  Noom was cool when I said I wanted to stop. And they are allowing me to keep the app and tools, more than fair.    Noom is so confident in their process it is not a big thing and they think I will sign up again.  I will sign up again, if I need to, but I just need to see if I can fly on my own for a while and see what I’ve learned from Noom.  No shame at all in the process, it’s all up to you, there is a great support system, great education, and a comradeship that is second to none. Keep an open mind, follow the science, dream big and wether you think you can or can’t, you’re right.  Noom rocks!

Title: Losing weight is about changing behaviors
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this program. At my age, I have been on just about every diet created. They all work but the weight comes back and then some. Most of us know how to lose weight. What we can’t seem to do is change the behaviors that keep us addicted to overeating. Noom focuses on behavior and little bit by little bit changing behaviors.  This a journey and marathon vs a quick fix. The program helps us understand that when we slip into old eating patterns, it’s just a bump in the journey not the end of it. I highly recommend Noom. The group you are assigned to can be a lifeline. I love my group. It’s people going through the same thing that I am. When one of us is struggling, everyone encourages. And when I am doing great, I can encourage someone else who is struggling. I think the group is one of the biggest factors in my persevering this time. I’m starting week 9 and have lost 14 pounds. I have a ways to go before I’m at goal. Remember, this is not a lose weight quick program. It’s a lose weight in a healthy way while changing behaviors program. I truly do not feel like I’ve had to sacrifice on this program and it’s something I can see me doing throughout the rest of my life.

Title: Very encouraging and realistic
----------------------------------------------------------
I was hesitant signing up for the trial, because I really felt like I just had no time to make any lifestyle changes right now even though I really wanted to. But right away my coach and team were so supportive. It does a great job coaching you along to make small, meaningful, realistic goals to make true lifestyle changes- not rushing and trying to do too much and crashing and burning. I've lost 12 pounds in the last 11 weeks, and I still have my ups and downs but I feel like my mind set in approaching things is so much healthier. I actually have training in motivational interviewing and psychology of behavior changes as a nurse, and I can see them applying so many of these concepts in the app. The readings are always short enough I can do them while getting ready in the morning. Some weeks I don't do what the app specifically wants me too- but it pushes me to be making intentional, mindful choices. And the support from my group mates is invaluable- it's always so encouraging to have them problem solve with me, and I feel inspired and motivated when trying to encourage them, too. They make me feel like I CAN do this, and also keep me from falling into bad  thought spirals.

Title: Gentle Nudging
----------------------------------------------------------
Over 60 and overweight most of my life, I’m pretty skeptical about one more diet to try, since feeling like I’ve tried them all, lost weight then gain back more. And they are not fun. On top of that, my mother is a psychologist, so I thought what are they going to teach me that I don’t already know. But after seeing my neighbor looking great with a 15lb weight loss on Noom, calm and happy, I decided to try. So far just a week in and lost 3lbs. But the best part is I feel I’m not really trying (I.e. suffering). Noom to me is like gentle nudging. It’s not time consuming as I feared, you read about 5-7 very short articles a day, they’re funny, not preachy and by logging in weight and food they keep you engaged. Having a coach check in helps keep you accountable, and you control how much interaction you want, how fast you want to go. I was happily surprised to find I could simultaneously log my Pilates and blood pressure, and daily steps automatically with the built in pedometer. Watching your graphs go down and getting little encouragements along the way is so satisfying and motivates you more. So far the gentle nudging is working, and seems to be all I need to keep on track!

Title: Lost 18 lbs and kept it off
----------------------------------------------------------
I am in my late 30’s and have slowly gained weight over the 9 years of being a mother. I never tried dieting, because I heard that they don’t work and you gain the weight back. December 2019 I bought a FitBit, upgraded my phone, purchased and annual subscription to Aaptiv, and started my journey with Noom on Jan 1st. I lost my first 10 lbs within a month. My calorie budget was only 1200 and it shocked my body as I didn’t sleep well for a month, but later I increased my budget and lost 8 more in the few weeks to follow. I learned so much about nutrition, my triggers, habits as well as new recipes. Ultimately, daily weigh ins, the weight graph, and logging my food, going to the gym three times a week for 30-60 min a day was all it took for me to see instant results. I wish I tried Noom sooner. I didn’t know that it would be so easy to lose the weight. I ended Noom three months ago, and have lost a pound or two and then gained a pound or two. Bottom line is, I have learned to better manage what I eat and to stay on top of exercise, even if that just means walking 30-60 min a day. I am likely going to join Noom again to lose another 20 pounds before the end of the year.

Title: 50+ pounds gone! 8 months total time!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been a WW member 6+ times and never succeeded.  On Noom my entire set of thought distortions disappeared.  Yes… “set”- “all or nothing mentality AND sweet food will make me feel happy”. I knew I had a problem with emotional eating but I didn’t realize how much I tripped myself up. I’m 67.  I wish I had found this program 40 years ago.  I met my goal in Noom! When I started they gave me a target date and I thought “ oh, no way can I lose my weight in that short of time…”  but I painlessly did!  The Psychology of this program is incredible. Simple, short daily lessons get into your mind.  Then two coaches- one personal, one group.  Yes, Noom works and the amazing thing is? I’ve tested myself by traveling and even buying ice cream. I never had an issue.  (Did you know ice cream gets ice crystals when being in the freezer too long?  Yes, yes it does!)  Noom works. It truly does. Oh! And ALL my blood work improved as well as my blood pressure!!  I didn’t know that even my kidneys could improve (although nothing was wrong- my numbers became excellent!) good health,  strength and a sunny attitude all make small pant size seem second best.  Good luck! You’ve got this!!

Title: Not your ‘Same Old’ weight loss program!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I don’t usually leave comments regarding apps or internet sites but just had to for NOOM. It’s only been a week but I can see why they have such great success. The approach is completely different from any others. They seem to really care about your progress and let you know that they are there for you by giving you one on one contact with a personal coach and others who actually follow up at least once a week to help you along the way. The online portion of the program is presented in a simple format that incorporates tutorials that are very easy to understand but very insightful. They help you to figure out what got you where you are today. Then they give you the tools to slowly make the changes in your day to day living to pull yourself out of the rut you may be in. They show you how to move on while avoiding the same old habits that created the rut in the first place. And they do it all while motivating you with a splash of humor that allows you to do this without the self recriminations that often accompany a person when they are just ‘dieting’. I am really excited about this program and look forward to working with NOOM to ultimately reach my final goals.

Title: Easy to Use
----------------------------------------------------------
The app is informative, educational, and easy to use. I think it could use some tweaks in regards to logging foods (more units of measure (e.g. thirds) and having consistent units of measure for all foods (some have multiple units and others only one or two)), making it easier to log when you have a custom dish (for breaking it out into the three different food color types), and having the ability to comment and rate the recipes that they have on the app (love that when you use a recipe that’s listed you can automatically log it into one of your meals). I also love that you can scan the barcode on packages to help log foods. There’s a good number of exercises listed that you can track. If your exercise isn’t listed you can select “custom” and it will list it as such but I wish there were more to choose from. Currently you can only see water intake or steps taken for the day. It would be nice to see the trend over time (for the week, month, etc.) You can log your weight daily and it is shown over time. It also projects a possible week into the future when you will hit your goal which is nice. Overall I’m very happy with the app and would give it a 4.75.

Title: Do It!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve tried a lot of weight loss programs and a lot of apps to lose weight. Nothing worked. But Noom is in a class by itself. You are not just thrown to the wolves and left to your own devices after you download the app. A friend recommended it and I told myself to commit to it and lose the excuses. It essentially puts it all together and fills in the shortcomings of all those other programs & apps. You will have a Coach and support of others in the same journey along the way. These people at Noom put in the time to get it right for everyone. I needed the psychological understanding of why I gained weight as well as daily instruction on new life habits and how to make them stick. In 20 days I’ve lost 16 pounds and can see my goal for the first time in my future. I haven’t even begun to exercise yet. And, trust me, that “daily instruction” is max 15 minutes on the app. I’ve made it my routine to log my morning weigh in, make a coffee, & read my daily Noom articles. It is laid out in small bites and they walk you through an understanding of how your body & brain work and achievable nutrition goals (nothing is “forbidden”) to get you on your way.

Title: I’ve Lost How Much? Find out how.
----------------------------------------------------------
I gained 80 pounds over a course of years. In 2005 I gained and lost 50 lbs. I didn’t start gaining again till 2011 and saw each year I’d put on 10-12 lbs each year. Being in my sixties I was assured it was normal. Okay, I can put up with 30 lbs or so but as the years click by it was relentless no matter what I did. Until this year 2019. This year being some 80# over weight I was getting desperate. I was looking at Cool Sculpting and other such remedies. Obviously I needed help. I saw the Noom App advertised for weeks and thought there’s no way an App was going to help, obviously, I’m a hard case and needed something professional. One night like mindlessly watching informercials I read the information on this tiny App and decided to give a try. After all they were offering a 30 day free trail. If I didn’t like it or it didn’t work like they said they would refund my money. I started March 1, 2019, today is March 30th and I’ve lost 20 pounds as of this morning. The information and support you get is better than any other program out there unless you spend 10 x as much. Try it please. If you follow the program I’m sure it will work for you.

Title: It works
----------------------------------------------------------
I lost 10 lbs in my first month. Anybody who has been on a diet before will find many elements of Noom familiar. There isn’t anything particularly novel or gimmicky about the core techniques: counting calorie intake against expenditure, weight tracking, meal logging, sensible eating, habit forming, etc. What makes Noom different, however, is that it brings all of these elements together into a comprehensive, easy-to-use, easy-to-follow system. There are also daily 10-minute tutorials that help to facilitate motivation while gradually introducing a real wealth of information to help users understand what is going on in their brains and bodies over the course of a diet. So, even though many of the techniques are familiar, they come across in a refreshingly integrated, educative manner. In other words, Noom doesn’t simply tell you what to do: it also explains the how and why. I have never found dieting so easy. On past diets, I’ve always felt as though I was battling hunger, pushing through on the force of pure determination. With Noom, it feels like less of a battle. I’ve simply re-organized my habits so hunger is no longer an issue.

Title: The missing link
----------------------------------------------------------
I am one of those people that has a pretty extensive background with exercise and nutrition.  Nothing professional but I have always known what I needed to do.  Bottom line?   I lacked the motivation or commitment to myself to make it happen.  Noom has worked for me!   I’m shocked.  It helps me pace myself and therefore creates stamina.  I am not in danger of burning out and reverting to my worst habits.  I’m building lasting rituals and routines that actually feel good rather than feel like I’m white-knuckling it through life.  It is just enough to create measurable positive change, but realistic enough to maintain.   I couldn’t be more pleased.  I know people start this journey from all walks of life and for all reasons - if you have a story similar to mine - I say try it out!   At 5’5” I have gone from 141 lbs to 132 in one week.   I know the weight loss won’t always be this drastic but the point is, I feel incredible.  I feel strong and satisfied.  Not hungry and depleted.   I can’t wait to see how this changes my life in the coming months and years.  I send all my love to anyone starting a new wellness journey.

Title: Awareness leads to consciousness.
----------------------------------------------------------
I am baffled that since I started Noom I have lost about 10 pounds. I’ve done so many other diets and spent so much of my life avoiding fruit and sweet things, and here I am eating fruit regularly and even occasional sweets just for fun. I guess it’s really that I’ve just always eaten too much. Last night my partner helped me recognize a moment where during a stressful conversation after dinner I just continued to eat sushi – I didn’t feel good about myself afterwards or good in my body, but I generally haven’t been over-eating lately at all and I really owe it to Noom for helping bring so much awareness to my habits. At first I was really anxious and hopeless that counting calories and daily weigh ins would trigger my years of disordered eating - but with the other psychological tools they offer it really hasn’t. It’s changed obsession to awareness. When I started, 15 pounds felt really hard, and like something I probably wouldn’t reach until late fall - if I succeeded at all. With top surgery coming up in less than six weeks, I can’t believe that I might actually make my goal weight before then. I am so grateful.

Title: Try it!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve only been on Noom for a week, as a trial period. I consider myself knowledgeable as far as my health goes. However, I’ve hit a road block into my long term goals(diet, exercise, life style change) Starting Noom, was exactly what I needed to slow me down and become more mindful to the whole process of changing my lifestyle. It’s informational, educational, structured(logging weight, meals, calories, exercise)and motivating. My everyday routine was getting boring and I hit a plateau. Even though I was exercising rigorously everyday, and eating a lot of healthy calories(for energy), I wasn’t taking off the extra weight I needed to lose. Although, I know that burning more calories than I’m consuming will help me to lose weight, I didn’t realize I was still consuming too many. With Noom, I was able to restructure my meal plans. I’m on the app first thing in the morning, and I follow the steps. Weighing in for starters. I look  forward to logging my meals, staying mindful and understanding my triggers and eating style. It’s only been a week, and I’ve already started losing weight! Onto my next week and I can’t wait!

Title: The Reluctant Noomer
----------------------------------------------------------
My daughter is getting married in May and her fiancée and his parents came to our house for Thanksgiving.  It was the usual spread of food and fun, with wine and pumpkin martinis and all the frills of a celebration.  We also had a bridal shower that weekend for her as well (everything masked and socially distant) with custom decorated cookies and all the brunch munchies, mimosas, all of it. That weekend was a celebration, and for several weeks before,  I had been trying a “program“ where are you fast all day every day and then eat a giant (really giant) salad for dinner. I had lost some weight, mostly water, before all the guests arrived.  I wanted to look good!   But the minute I went back to eating “normal“ in just the span of several days, I gained a lot back and felt bad about myself.  I was disappointed at the thought that I’d failed again and that if I wanted to lose, fasting and giant salads were the only way to go. I knew it was not something that would be sustainable for me as I love to cook and entertain.  I was ready to give up again on another “program”.   This is why I tell you about Thanksgiving…

Despite being healthy and fit for most of my life, aging and some habits I wasn't aware of can catch up with you and make you feel stuck and a little frustrated when trying to lose weight. This was me. After several health setbacks in my life, I had been carrying an extra 15 -20 lbs. I just couldn't seem to shed the last 10. With NOOM I feel encouraged and motivated, mostly through education and daily articles. I have lost 5 solid pounds, for my clothes, feel more energetic and healthy and mostly I finally believe that last 5 pounds will come off and stay off with the accountability and support of NOOM coaches and program. For me, this program is worth it. I'm not into fad or even deprivation diets ; NOOM is neither. You choose the goals, you choose the pace, and you stay in charge the whole way, letting go of self -doubt, shame and guilt all the way. Good-bye unhealthy foid relationships, hello self awareness. Worth a try, even if you're just curious if it's for you. For me, the two month plan has been worth it. Anything less and I wouldn't have fully experienced the benefits of starting to feel successful.

Title: Amazing program that works!
----------------------------------------------------------
I never thought I would be this weight again. I have lost 16 pounds in three months and continue to use noom. The fact that it focuses on psychology and our erroneous mental concepts regarding not just food but self-concept in general has COMPLETELY shifted how I look at food and weight. Some people may be turned off by the cost, but I’ll tell you, I was glad to pay it. The fact that I paid money gave me more of an initial push to see it through. I was desperate and, though I really couldn’t afford it, I told myself I have to do something and I pressed the OK button before I could talk myself out of it, and it was the best $100 I have ever spent. I am back to the weight I was before I was pregnant and can fit in all my old clothes. When I started I had one pair of pants I could fit in. Now I stop and look when I pass a mirror wondering if I’m dreaming. I stare at the scale and think it must be wrong! I have tried other diets, even one I loved, but noom is the first eating plan that has not made me feel deprived. I have learned so much about myself. I could have never accomplished any of this without noom.

Title: The Stars Have Alined
----------------------------------------------------------
The timing was right and the Noom tool box is helping to map and track this journey.  I find the App and the Program very simple and easy to follow.   I am anxious to open the App daily , read a little and enter my data.  The interface with my Apple Watch or Fitbit tracks my exercise and other data for me. I can see the results.  Watching the pounds disappear is wonderful encouragement but I gain knowledge and encouragement from the program even on the days the scales don’t move or move the wrong way.  I am 69 years old and in my younger years I could pursue a low carb diet and loose weight quickly. But after I hit age 55 diets that once worked no longer did.  My story isn’t over yet but with Noom as my coach I feel I am eating normal, sensible meals, finally managing portion control and still enjoying what I eat.  The app teaches you a lot about yourself.  I was surprised to learn many subscribers don’t use the feature that I think is my key to success so far.  The daily food log and calorie counter is so easy to use and takes so little time.   I am excited to continue on this journey with Noom.

Title: #MindOverMatter
----------------------------------------------------------
Using psychology and science, Noom has surpassed my expectations!  I originally signed up to try this to see if it might be something my daughter might try.  I only had about 12 pounds to lose myself and thought’ “why not” it’s worth a try.  I exercise regularly, eat pretty well, and am overall healthy.  I really didn’t think that I would learn anything new that I already didn’t know.  I was pleasantly surprised by the things that I didn’t know.  Noom has changed my way of thinking about food and has helped me so far to lose the pounds that I have struggled to get off for years.  I’m 5 weeks in and have lost 6.2 pounds.  I’m closer than I’ve ever been to my goal.  I have tried Weight Watchers, Whole 30, Keto, and others...  I’ve felt super restricted and after these programs ended, went right back up in weight.  Noom has taught me that there are no bad foods, just eat within moderation and portion control, among many other #psychtips.  I highly recommend this program if you’ve tried everything else and haven’t found much success.  It’s not a diet, it’s a way of life and a health education!

Title: Noom is a wonderful program!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried many successful weight loss programs and supplements. Noom is different because it teaches the physiological (hormone changes, fat storing and burning processes, and proper dietary necessities) and how the body reacts psychologically to the changes in your diet which alters your attitude and all around mental image of yourself. You are given awareness as to how others around you affect your diet and how to combat the stressful eating environment around you. The coaches you work with are awesome and the community you work with inside the noom application gives you inspiration and support. So far I have been using Noom about a month I started with my weight at 326 lbs and in thirty days I have now weighed in this morning at 306 lbs. That is great! I feel wonderful! Noom helps you loose the weight in a steady downward process giving you lasting results with a dietary understanding and application to continue to succeed. If you struggle with your weight, with depression from your weight, and want to change with  success, then like me Noom will definitely help you. Give Noom a try!

There is excellent information each day to explain the science behind losing weight.   The authors of the daily information talk about complicated subjects but keep it simple.  It helps the participant not to get discouraged when the scale fluctuates up and down.  There are physiological reasons why this happens and it is normal. Other daily lessons touch on the fact that good nutrition with a restriction in calories will not only help you to lose weight but you will experience other benefits - feeling more energy,  clothes fit better, digestion improves, etc.  Also, you move at you own pace.  There are weekly challenges that are introduced and you may participate at whatever level you feel comfortable or that your schedule or lifestyle affords you. You are also assigned to a group and you are asked to share comments about your experience, etc.   This program is well thought out and sustainable for life!  I am very thankful that I heard their commercial on the radio.  The holidays were approaching and I knew I could not continue my bad and thoughtless eating behavior another day!

Title: Took the leap
----------------------------------------------------------
A month ago, I had reached an all time high of my weight, felt crummy and decided enough: it’s time to make a change! After months of seeing their ads, I took a leap of faith and joined Noom. What got me excited was seeing a projected date of when I’d reach my goal. A vision of me at my goal fuels me to stay the course; the support I have gotten from the daily lessons, insights into the science and psychology of why I’ve been doing what I’ve been doing for 60 years, coaching and an app that is easy to use have provided the tools to keep me engaged and committed daily. The recipe library is stocked with easy to prepare recipes that even meet the taste approval of my 26 year old son. There are tons of suggestions of navigating distorting thoughts about our relationship to food, as well as tips to help lead to success. Everyone’s progress is different but I’ve dropped 22 lbs already and am genuinely enjoying the journey. I have more energy, feel more comfortable in my skin and yes, clothes are fitting better already. Thank you Noom; I’m looking forward to the next leg of my journey!

Title: Finally
----------------------------------------------------------
So I’m a senior female who has struggled her whole life with weight issues.  I reached my mid forties and all hell broke loose.  So in the past 20 years, since I met my husband, I and we have celebrated ever since.  That’s means a 75 lb weight gain in 20 years.  I thought being told what to eat was the answer. Showing up for meetings, etc.   well my daughter and her husband told me about a program called Noom which they were working with.  Now granted they had 10 lbs or so to loose but wanted to know why their behavior was what it was.  So I thought, why not? One more avenue to explore.  Well it’s working!   I am journaling each day the education I am getting through NOOM and studying as though I am a student.  Oh and let me mention I am well educated in nutrition being a trained vegan and raw food chef!  Yup and that meant nothing without the psychology to support it.  My weekly coach gets back to me in a timely fashion, the group is interactive and we pretty much have daily positive reinforcement!   So talk to me in September and I will fill you all in on the brand new, old me!

Title: Very happy Noomer!
----------------------------------------------------------
Noom is not a diet!  It is a lifestyle change based in fact.  It destroys weight lose myths.  It makes u aware of all aspects of life and how they affect your eating habits.  Then it helps u learn how to reform those habits into a healthy, sustainable lifestyle.  You become part of a community of people that are all following the same teachings, yet u all retain your individuality within the community as u learn.  Anyone who is willing to submerse themselves completely in the program will succeed in losing weight, gaining energy, feeling and looking younger and more vibrant, and having a more positive outlook in regards to themselves and life.  I have 11 days left in the 4 month program and 4 lbs left to lose to reach my goal of losing 40lbs.  I have no doubt in my mind that I will reach this goal and never have the weight boomerang back on me.  Yes, it can seem daunting at times, but honestly it is the most and easiest weight I have ever lost in my life.  And I enjoyed it!  Forget those fad diets that will never last u a lifetime, and enjoy the freedom that comes with Noom 😁

Title: Fantastic app
----------------------------------------------------------
No “diets” per se ever work. It’s all just math — burn more calories than you take in.  The question is how to get there.  This app handles all aspects — psychology, food logging, overcoming scale anxiety, analyzing what you eat and helping you understand your food choices, you name it.  It’s a tool for permanently changing how you look at food.  I have worked with many personal trainers over the years and they all have told me to log everything I eat so they could analyze it, even when I was in great shape, but I never did.  Now I do because Noom makes it so easy.  For example, I shop a lot at Trader Joe’s and it seems they have every Trader Joe’s item in their pop-up database.  Once you log something it keeps it in the pop-up menu so it is even faster to log next time.  Usually takes me only 30 seconds or so to log all components of a meal.  Then the app analyzes what you had, and the results are very eye opening.  Things I always thought were healthy aren’t and vice versa.  So you start changing your shopping and eating habits, and it has a cascade effect.  It’s great.

Title: Just when you think you can’t learn more ...
----------------------------------------------------------
I wasn’t thrilled with the idea of logging food again, but I rid myself of the all-or-nothing thinking and logged, but not all, and as I took time to add recipes and my database grew i had more bandwidth to log more. Historically I’d launch into a new plan full steam ahead. I began Noom by dipping my toe in the water. I signed up for the two week trial. After a week meh. Probably was pretty close to the end of the two weeks when i realized i was thinking about the lessons / suggestions / advice offered in my articles throughout the day. It was working. I needed to commit to the program because i had become attached to the articles. The articles are helping change the way I think about myself and my relationship with food.  Weight is coming off. Slow and steady.  I have a patience for the timing in a way I haven’t had in the past. I have also eliminated all vegetable and seed oils from my diet for two months and have never felt better! That garbage is in EVERYTHING!!! My trifecta personal magic combo: intermittent fasting; none of the vegetable and seed oils and NOOMING!

Title: Not like any diet I've tried!
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm not the type to write reviews, but I'll make an exception for Noom. I've tried more diets than I care to admit. I always either lose the weight and gain it back once I've finished the program (and each time, the pounds bring friends!) or realize it's not something I can sustain and give up. With Noom, not only have I lost 8.5lbs after a few short weeks, but I've learned more about the food I eat, why I tend to gravitate to certain foods, how to break old habits, and how to make simple changes for healthier meals. Noom has changed my thinking and relationship with food. It's helping me learn how to replace my old unhealthy habits with new healthier ones. Nothing is off limits (not even cookies) so I never feel deprived. With Noom I eat more, stay full longer, and I feel better - mentally and physically. It's worth every penny to know I will never have to pay for another ridiculous, unsustainable fad diet ever again now that I'm armed with the information needed to make healthy changes to last a lifetime. I highly recommend Noom! #knowledgeispower #lovemynoomnerds

Title: Noom weight management program
----------------------------------------------------------
Started program 1-3-21. Today is day 6. I’ve lost 10.4 lbs, and have gained enormous confidence, self control, and energy, in regards to my relationship with food. I’ve tried most of the weight management programs. This is head and shoulders better. The constant accountability Noom provides is better than WW, and WW is very good. The coaching is great. I feel like I have a friend with me, as if a prophetic spirit encouraging me and providing guidance. It all begins with a desire to improve, having confidence in Noom, and believing in yourself. Think of this as an investment in yourself. We only live this life 1 time. Believe in yourself and Noom will provide all the guidance you need to gain or regain control your health and life. I’m very encouraged and am looking forward to my year long journey with Noom. Rome wasn’t built in a day and anything worth having is worth working for. If you’re feeling discouraged, just remember tough times never last, but tough people do. Care about yourself. I don’t know you and I care about you. Just think of Noom as a care package.

Title: Worth It!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m honestly surprised at how effective and easy this program is. Like many other reviewers, I have struggled with my weight most of my life. I have lost and regained weight more times than I can count - usually through restrictive, unsustainable dieting. Noom allows you to eat whatever you want, so long as you limit your portions. I was nervous when I saw I only got 1200 calories/day - been there, done that. The difference is that Noom teaches you about caloric density (aka - eat nutrient rich foods and stay full for longer/feel more satisfied). I’m surprised to say I never feel deprived or starving like I have in the past. Probably because I’m not telling myself certain foods are off limits! I will say that I had a pretty strong understanding of nutrition and generally cook my own clean meals, so it may have been easier for me than for others. Had I not had this background knowledge, I probably would have struggled - at least for a few weeks while I figured it out. As it is though - 14 lbs in 5 weeks isn’t too shabby. Excited to see how much further I can go!

Title: Real review from personal trainer and yoga instructor
----------------------------------------------------------
I am completely surprised at the quality of this app. I did not expect it to be so full of knowledge, so fun and that any app could actually change behavior so readily. But this one does. In past lives I have been a certified personal trainer and I currently am a yoga instructor so I know a lot about the body and anatomy and I have also lost weight multiple times in my life very successfully but never kept it off. What makes this app different is the psychology focus. Every day you learn a bit more about how your brain and your body works and why you keep going back to over eating. That knowledge eventually becomes wisdom as you put things into practice and see the success so I really feel as though this is making a permanent change for me. Plus they add a lot of humor which makes it compelling, I honestly look forward to reading each days tips and tricks. There are also wonderful recipes that are very satisfying and tracking everything is super easy. Do you like I did, try it free for a week and you’ll see for yourself. It’s a different kind of health app.

Title: Genius program - plain and simple
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve never tried any diets before, always assuming I wouldn’t stick to them. I thought I had no willpower! But having gained TWO STONE of late, mostly due to close proximity of my kitchen and love of wine during Covid, I decided to give Noom a go. I’ve lost almost a stone in the first month! It makes it easy to calorie count but the best part is the daily dose of psychology. I don’t bother much with the group chat stuff, but the app is set up for self reliability and accountability. Nothing is off limits. I just have little bits of the stuff I love and fill the rest of my plate with healthy veg. I have even cut down my wine consumption from about 3 bottles a week to a couple of glasses a week. I feel like I will get to my goal in another 6 weeks or so. So 2 stone in 10 weeks! That’s the goal and with Noom I feel 100% confident that I can achieve it. My only gripe is that the step count has not been updating with a higher count to hit each day so I’ve been having to do that manually. But otherwise I love it. Thank you Noom for making something so brilliant!

Title: Joyce -
----------------------------------------------------------
Like most people starting something new, I was skeptical about Noom- the cost are higher than some programs but the investment has definitely been worth it for me. I have been using the program for 4 weeks and am very happy. I feel really good and am learning to balance my food choices. My goal has been to lose about 10 lbs. I have lost 4 before plateauing for the moment. But I know with continued knowledge about nutrition the additional 6 lbs will eventually be shed as well. I have good energy and  my clothes fit better. What I like most is the ongoing online support and research-based information that is provided along with daily snippets of practicing behavioral changes that lead to lifetime changes. The ability to log my foods and truly see exactly how much I am consuming of red, yellow and green foods is really great too. The program is teaching me how to appreciate food  and truly embrace a long term healthy life style. I would highly recommend. The initial cost is very minimal compared to the overall costs of potential long term health problems.

Title: So far so good!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have just started this program today and I’m looking forward to what it will do for me. I’ve read some good reviews and some bad ones, but overall I’m still going to do the 2-week trial and see how it goes. Habits are the keys to success and I truthfully believe that this app will take you through the process on how to form better habits. So many people have no idea where to start when it comes to losing weight and it’s all about the habits. But then how do you form those habits? Well this is what Noom helps you do. Yes it’s pricey, but for four months of access to this app it may just change your life. I’m a college student trying to work off the freshman 15 still (currently a junior) and also a psych major and I can say psychology plays a major role in losing weight. I see that a lot of the bad reviews complain about the food tracker being vague, but what do they expect? It’s a somewhat new app so obviously it’s not going to have a lot of options on it. Over time this app will get better! May update my review after the two week trial is over.

Title: Great Program with a Few Flaws
----------------------------------------------------------
I lost weight on Noom faster and more consistently than I have on any other program and what I’ve learned from the CBT lessons has been helpful in other aspects of my life. In fact, I decided to buy an annual subscription so I can continue to learn and cement the changes I’ve made in my behavior and approach to food to maximize the likelihood I’ll keep my weight off. My two complaints are (1) there’s no change in the program when you reach goal weight to help you transition to weight stabilization and (2) lots of the calories in their app are incorrect for foods I eat regularly so I have to enter those foods by calculating the calories instead of selecting the serving size, an extra step that makes logging my meals more of a hassle.  As a result, until I realized this flaw in the app, I was eating a lot fewer than the minimum number of calories Noom recommends. I reported these errors through the app months ago but they haven’t been fixed. It’s still a great program though! Just double check the calories of the foods you eat if they seem off.

Title: Game changer
----------------------------------------------------------
Noom is a game changer. I have been very successful on big name weight loss program for a decade but then it came to a point where I struggled and felt stuck. I knew what to do but I didn’t have the drive to stick it through. Noom focuses on behavior and gave me more of the psychology of how and why my body reacts a certain way and how my behavior influences those reactions. I appreciate the daily reminders and notifications. Whenever I think I may have a slip, I get a notification urging me to track my food or a message from my coach to reset a new goal. The ongoing accountability is exactly what I need. The daily articles help shift your mindset and keep you renewed and fresh-every single day.  No longer do you need to wait a whole week to get that “etch a sketch” moment in some meeting to shake off the slips you may have had. You get to shake it off immediately, because you have new reminder notifications urging you to get back on plan , log your next meal, and group support that continues to hold you accountable !  Love this program.

Title: Convenience is king!
----------------------------------------------------------
So everyone kind of knows what we should do regarding our eating and exercise habits, but we rarely DO what we think we should! This app doesn’t JUST make it ridiculously easy to be informed, to face your psychological triggers, to measure and evaluate what you eat, to follow a realistic, gentle and clearly outlined path toward freedom—but it does all these things by becoming a NATURAL and SEAMLESS part of your day! The platform is really the brilliant thing here, because anyone can dig in and research these topics, or count their calories, but THIS is having a shepherd. THIS is having a “shoulder angel” with a degree in fitness and nutrition psychology! THIS is having a counselor in your pocket, who will leave exactly the thought you needed to hear on the day you needed to hear it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! If you struggle with the self-discipline needed for a healthy lifestyle (and don’t we all??), this is the way to go when you’re sick and tired of where you’re at! Break the cycle, try this app! You don’t have to do everything alone anymore.

Title: I’m so glad I tried it out
----------------------------------------------------------
I was one of the skeptics. I’ve done many weight loss programs and I didn’t think there could really be something different. I decided to try because of the first two weeks free, so I had nothing to loose. It’s been just one week and I’m loving it so much! I’ve lost 5 pounds. What I like the most os that your calorie plan is not fixed. It depends on your physical activity during the day. If I do more activity it gives me more calories allowance. So this keeps me motivated every day to exercise more because I get a reward for doing it. If I exceed my caloric budget I just go on the treadmill for a while or walk around the neighborhood or do some weight lifting or yoga. The application is beautiful, entertaining and easy to use. The feature to log your food is sooooo easy and the food database is huge so I log my food in 15 secs (no exaggeration here. I never teview apps, I’m too lazy for this, but I had to review this app because I see so many skeptic people in the Facebook comments and I want to encourage you to try. Nothing to loose.

Title: While I don’t use it anymore, it got me on a path of success!
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using Noom in August of 2019, and I didn’t even spend a dime. It gave me a simple easy to understand recap of the foods I ate, and didn’t make me feel bad when I messed up. You can track your food, your weight, and your steps. It helps you take your baby steps into the world of fitness. With Noom, I went from 172lbs to 144lbs over a course of 7 months, and I know that sounds like a long time, but I didn’t exercise right up until February. I lost 20 pounds from August to December. I’m not too big of a guy, I’m only 16 to be honest and I probably shouldn’t have been using this app. But it really did change my life. Eventually after a few months of using this app, I stopped because it became a habit and a lifestyle to be healthy. It taught me that you don’t have to rush things. I do run almost everyday now, but that’s my choice, and you don’t have to exercise and eat well and be overwhelmed in your first few months. I still come back every now and again just to record my progress. Thank you guys so much for making this app!!!!

Title: Fantastic App
----------------------------------------------------------
My brother recommended this app after losing over 30 pounds in a fairly short amount of time. But I was still skeptical, partly because of the price and there were other free calorie counters out there. However, after finding a coupon, I decided to give it a try. I’m only a week in, but it has really changed my life. Yes, I’ve lost a few pounds, but it’s more than that. I appreciate the psychology backed up by science. It helps me to start the day with a big motivational boost. I’m working out twice a day and eating healthier (while not denying myself favorite foods). Mentally, physically, and emotionally I feel better. The only “thing” I would give a low score is the goal specialist. It doesn’t appear she really reads my text messages and her messages to me seem to be canned. The program would be better if they lowered the price for those who just want the app and not the goal specialist. It might be worth it if there was an actual, “real” back and forth with a personal goal specialist, but so far that doesn’t seem to be the case.

Title: Love it!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
BEST APP EVER!!!! Easy to use, educational, motivational and provides healthy nutrition advice.  I’m a 57 year old female health care professional with nutritional education experience.  Unfortunately, I have personally used many diet programs to lose the stubborn 25 pounds I’ve gained over the last ten years.  This is the best, easiest program, (I’m not tech savvy,) that provides outstanding recipes, group support and individual coach guidance.   No crazy supplements, strange packaged food, costly trips for weigh ins, and diets that exclude carbs, fats etc.   I LOVE the ability to use the app when it’s convenient for ME!   I’m often too busy with my large family, work and have zero time for myself.  Noom makes logging meals, tracking steps/exercise, and weight measurements effortless.  This is a program you can use for life, it will help you lose and maintain weight, while still enjoy foods you love!  (Worth EVERY penny, and the cost of this app is significantly lower than ALL of the well known 10+ diet programs I’ve tried!!).

Title: Great program
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been Nooming for about four weeks now I really enjoy the program the articles are interesting and very informative . The  support group is really well structured as they guide us with constructive conversation each day. It is really starting to change my perspective. I am starting to feel good about myself and I am becoming confident in my food choices.  Which  says a lot for their program.   I look forward to reading their articles each day.  When I first joined I really thought it was going to be very hokey. I was taking the two week free trial thinking I wouldn’t possibly join I was  looking for a temporary free motivational tool because with Sheltering I was gaining weight and I was desperate to stop my stress eating. I needed a distraction . But  by the end of the two weeks there was no doubt in my mind I wanted to continue and the articles just keep getting better.  I would encourage anybody to try the two week free trial and see if it’s a good fit for you. After all what go you got to lose besides those extra lbs?
