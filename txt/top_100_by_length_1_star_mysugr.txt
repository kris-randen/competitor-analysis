Title: Very Disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
mySugr was very disappointing.  I downloaded the free version just after my diabetes diagnosis.  It came with very little details of operation, so it took me several hours to figure the basic operation and a week later I was still figuring out the many nuances.  I was shocked by the cost of the ‚Äúpro features‚Äù: $2.99/mo. or $27.99 for the year.  I was excited with mySgr because it touted an ‚Äúestimated HbA1c.‚Äù   So, I poked my fingers 3x/day for 7 days to get 21 BG readings.  When I then selected the HbA1c with all those reading, the app gave me an alert that it was only available in pro features.  Nowhere did it specify that Est. HbA1c was only available in pro features.  I went back to the app description at the App Store and reviewed that.  It listed ‚ÄúFeatures/Add-ons‚Äù but did not clarify which Features/Add-ons were part of the paid version.  Even in the intra-app ‚Äúlogbook manual‚Äù describing Est. HbA1c, there was no mention of it being a pro feature.   I felt deceived.  Seven days of sticking my fingers to then find out that I was misled.  I was so furious I finally just quit using the app and found other means to track my readings like the Apple Heart App.  Also, I didn‚Äôt care for the childish animation, badges, and sound effects.  I am deleting this app.

Title: All glucose entry‚Äôs gone
----------------------------------------------------------
I was in love with this app a couple of days ago. I just needed something easy to track my levels and to see a graph of my habits on the pill and off the pill. I woke up this morning with all my entry‚Äôs gone expect maybe 3-5 for the last couple of months of manual entry. YIKES!!!! I logged out and back in thinking there might have been an error but no data came back. The only things I see for each day is either ‚Äúbefore meal‚Äù with no glucose level or my input of the pill.... there isn‚Äôt a way for me to go to settings and click SYNC or BACKUP and I feel there should be a manual way to push a sync button or backup button so this does not happen again.  I can‚Äôt say that I will be using this app anymore sadly..

Title: My sugar Or One Drop
----------------------------------------------------------
Good app for tracking blood glucose.  Since I dropped my pro membership I think I have lost some of my report capabilities.  I would love to come back but I need to track my carbs and other nutritions.  Since Loose It is no longer allowed to communicate with my sugar it doesn‚Äôt help me. Is there any plans to bring back this communication? Or, is there any other way to get the carb/nutritional information from the Health app into my sugar. It‚Äôs up to you guys wether I can come back. Right now one drop does allow loose it information to come over. However I like your reporting a little better. Please let me know for I‚Äôm about to choose one drop or one sugar for a meter/strip program.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi David! Thank you for reaching out. You are correct, the PDF and Excel reports are exclusively part of the Pro or Bundle membership.

Title: It‚Äôs basic
----------------------------------------------------------
It‚Äôs a basic program for tracking your glucose, nothing great or special for free. If you‚Äôre willing to pay an arm and a leg for the full deal of extras is just crazy and not worth it to me since I only check my level once a day, first thing in the morning. Maybe if I was one that had to check my levels a few times to several times a day, it might be worth it. Plus there is no features to allow you to repeat your meds or other information from the previous day to speed up your entries. Also supposedly it should link with your Apple health, but it doesn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd spend $50 a month for this app.

Title: Not worth the effort
----------------------------------------------------------
There is no telling how many people like me will delete the app because to activate it you receive a code to your email address.  I asked it to send the code to two different emails about six times each and never received an email.  Yes, I checked the spelling of the email address each time, and that is not the issue.  The issue is a glitch in the app.  Unfortunately, no one from the developer checks to make sure the app is working, and there is no way to contact the developer to let them know it screwed up.  So, save your time and energy and find another app that works when you install it.

Title: HONESTY
----------------------------------------------------------
Honesty would demand that you acknowledge that one cannot access your app until AFTER you collect information from them, and after they pay a subscription fee to you. It‚Äôs truly deceptive that you Intentionally neglect to list on the download page that this fee IS REQUIRED prior to use of your app. And concealing it as an ‚Äúin app purchase‚Äù is pretty grimy. For the record, if you have to pay a ‚Äúsubscription fee‚Äù before being given access to the app, it is NOT an ‚ÄúIN‚Äù app purchase. It is a fee to use the app.

Title: Do not pay for membership
----------------------------------------------------------
I got this membership hoping it would be a better platform than my freestyle libre. The testing kit/ starter kit accu check is cheap and terrible and is not worth the 49.00 a month. It constantly has connection issues and when letting support know of the issue constantly they just keep informing me to reset Bluetooth. And requiring customers to commit for three months is insane considering issues with my accu check began within the first three weeks. Stay away I only use this to log sugars from my libre.

Strips arrive as needed - app works fine, but if you want to cancel, it‚Äôs HORRIBLE.  I‚Äôve been trying for 2 months to cancel. My only hope is to protest the credit card charges at this point. You can‚Äôt access your card info. You can‚Äôt talk to a human. The coaches don‚Äôt respond. All of my 17 emails apparently went to spam. The only way I successfully contacted them was with support form on website. That results in an e-mail from them but my many replies are ignored. Beware!

Title: More of a Game
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using Glucose Buddy for a few years now and thought I'd try this app. I read the reviews and decided to purchase the full app. Unfortunately, this app is too gimmicky and seems to be more about challenges and points vs seriously tracking your blood sugar. This app does not allow you to clearly follow your readings before and after each meal. The app is more suited for younger kids. I would recommend Glucose Buddy if you want a clear and simple app.

Well, I've been living with the update now and I ABSOLUTELY HATE that you guys took away the monthly averages. Plus all my pics were deleted that I had used before. What the heck! I feel like I'm unprepared going to my next endo appointment not having pertinent info to calculate my A1c on my own - really really frustrated. Already downloaded a new app to try instead of this one. It may not have the cute monster but at least the info is readily available.

Title: Collects data you then can‚Äôt see
----------------------------------------------------------
Carefully input meds, meter readings, insulin dose, exercise, meals...but it only let‚Äôs me see a daily log of meter readings (heck the METER does that) and icons for meals.  No tracking that I did (or didn‚Äôt) take meds, and exercise appeared first thing in the AM on days I didn‚Äôt exercise yet‚Äîand couldn‚Äôt edit that.  Nice idea, but not fully functional and I‚Äôm not taking the time to enter data unless the tracking is more robust and can multi-track.

I love this app it's perfect for what I need it has a lot of features.

Title: $30/year to print/export logs
----------------------------------------------------------
I generally like the app, and while I appreciate that the developers need to make money, Diabetes, especially Type 1, is expensive enough and to have to pay (you have to GoPro) to print a "report" (blood log for your doctor) is just excessive. I would pay 9.99 for the app out right, but not $30 per year. In my opinion exporting logs is the only real value in going pro, the challenges are good, but not essential.

Title: Crashes upon opening
----------------------------------------------------------
I liked this app when I first got it, however, at this point, it crashes when I initially open it. The scanner module I purchased for it is unreliable. It frequently picks a date from last year, even though my meter doesn't display the year. So you'd think the current year would be an implicit assumption for this app, but no, it's not. Getting the data from the scanner reliably into the log is hit or miss too.

----------------------------------------------------------
I deleted the app, deleted paired Accu-Chek guide device and tried multiple times to pair for this app. It finds the device and then hangs after enter pin. No keyboard comes up to enter pin in my iPhone, to enter the displayed pin from the ACCU-CHEK guide device. I am now just using this with my Accu-Chek App. Things would be simpler if the ACCU-CHEK App could allow mysugr to read the data.

I‚Äôve contacted support twice to report that tags and notes are not showing up in the reports. This means I have to log my notes and tags twice to send to my doctor.

Having to track everything eaten and every glucose test is hard enough - losing my data is making it even harder.

I went to the search option & all these colorful icons appeared. I thought this looks great. Icon after icon I tapped read "This is a Pro Feature!" I googled the cost of the Pro feature;$2.99 per MONTH!  Not a one time charge or yearly charge, it's a MONTHLY fee that adds up to just under $36 a year. I'm removing this app after the review and downloading a simple diary app.

Title: This app requires you to give your email
----------------------------------------------------------
This is just a warning to not bother getting this app if you're like me and refuse to give in to apps that require you to enter personal info (i.e. your email address) in order to function at all. There is no reason in the world why you should have to "create an account" in order to keep track of a series of numbers, which is private HIPAA information anyway. Deleted.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your concern. Because the app is connected to the mySugr cloud right away and the data isn't saved only locally to the device, the user must create an account so that we can properly associate the data to the right user and the password keeps it locked safely away. Here is a link regarding the safety and privacy of your information :)

Not Clearly Stated in the description: You must create a login to use.  Reading the privacy statement fully gives the impression that any and all data entered may/will be uploaded to the developer.

I'm on an iPhone 6+ and since the newest update the app just opens to a green screen or closes automatically.  I can't get in to log my readings.  I don't want to delete and reinstall as it says I will lose my data. Please help.

Title: Misses the mark
----------------------------------------------------------
This probably could be a good app, but falls short on two very important fronts. Carb ratio only goes up to 1/20. Sorry, my son has not been 1/20 since he was 10! That is just crazy and not sure why they would limit that so low.

The newest update monetized key features that had been free such as tagging a post that you had changed needles or were feeling sick/stressed. A disappointing and obvious cash grab from a previously very good app.

Hi Eaglewarr there is a free version of the app, as well as a subscription for our the mySugr bundle. The mySugr Bundle is $39/mo, but it's much more than unlimited test strips. You also get a starter kit that includes a BG meter, lancet device, extra lancets in addition to the app (synced BGs, estimated A1c, digital logbook, printable PDF reports, and much more) PLUS unlimited access to a Certified Diabetes Health Coach at the push of a button to help in between doctors visits.
