Title: Beware of adding a second pregnancy!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm pregnant with my second and wanted to use the app to log this pregnancy like I did my first. The app has an option to ‚Äúadd another pregnancy‚Äù which I selected and added my new due date. I then tried to go back to my first pregnancy, since the app clearly said I was adding ANOTHER pregnancy and not replacing or changing the due date, but my first pregnancy had been deleted. I am extremely upset that all of my data is gone, I specifically wanted to use this app because I thought it would allow me to compare between pregnancies because I had complications with my first. I am devastated that all the information I so carefully logged while anxiously awaiting my first child is just gone, without ANY warning. At the very least, the app should very clearly warn users that their prior pregnancy will be deleted if they try to use it a second time, it is extremely misleading to call it ‚Äúadd another pregnancy‚Äù when it is in fact REPLACING the first.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------

Title: people are rude
----------------------------------------------------------
The app itself is great, gives kind of a visual on how big the baby should be, articles for each week, and you can ask questions to other moms. However I‚Äôve noticed as a first time mom and other first time moms on there I have a ton of questions that others should be helpful and answer however there are a TON of RUDE people. Its to the point where it‚Äôs discouraging to a first time mom to even ask a question and not expect 5 rude answers in return. Definitely not worth it. Maybe they should monitor the comments better and when a person reports a rude comment block the person commenting from continuing to harass the person who reported it. If you are a first time mom and looking for answers to your questions I highly suggest going somewhere else unless you enjoy being talk down upon and rude responses. Deleting this app after this review because I can‚Äôt handle bullies. Sorry not sorry.

Title: Ovia makes money sharing your intimate data with your boss and insurance co
----------------------------------------------------------
Please look up the Washington Post article ‚ÄúIs your pregnancy app sharing your intimate data with your boss?‚Äù highlighting spevically how Ovia uses incentive programs to profit on sharing your most vulnerable details, including your sex life, menstrual cycles, & high risk pregnancy factors with both your employers and health insurance companies. The CEO of Ovia is quoted in the article saying that the women‚Äôs health crisis ‚Äúis impacting the folks who are responsible for these outcomes‚Äîboth financially and for the health of the members they‚Äôre accountable for.‚Äù Those are his own words in the belief that companies responsible for our health care need to keep a surveillance eye on what is happening with our own bodies and babies. I deleted my Ovia app and my pregnant & new moms groups are all outraged and doing the same. Boycott Ovia!!

Title: Annoying bugs and ads
----------------------------------------------------------
This app will help track your pregnancy, though I prefer The Bump. The reason is that Ovia has lots of annoying bugs, one of which is the weight tracking feature which has been fully broken for several months. Very frustrating and they just won't fix it. It won't show me my past data (why did I bother entering it?) and there's no option to export. It also shows my weight trend as being outside the healthy zone even though it's been within the goal area. Worse though are the constant ads for breast pumps and cord blood banking. By the way, since most hospitals do delayed cord clamping, there is basically no need for cord blood banking. Enough of these ads. Seems misleading for a pregnancy app to confuse pregnant women with these ads.

Title: Just no.
----------------------------------------------------------
If you try for a long time to get pregnant I would not go with this app. The way the lady in the videos talks about the weeks of pregnancy was very discouraging to me. I also feel like they point out what could go wrong more than they talk about the great things your baby is doing at this time. She also mentions that 23 weeks is too early to buy baby stuff? Everyone has their own option but I just found this app very discouraging and overbearing. Also the sizes are off some weeks. If you‚Äôre wanting a positive pregnancy app that will not having you worry about things you shouldn‚Äôt be, this friends is not for you.

Title: Disappointing
----------------------------------------------------------
With all the controversy over Covid-19 and the rapid vaccination rollout, the push in the feed to get the vaccination and saying that it is safe when there are many pregnant patients who have received and miscarried within 2 days to a week after receiving the vaccination. Extremely sensitive topic and not enough known to be making recommendations. I also saw the flu vaccine info in the settings/account tab. These suggestions have made me question the information and recommendations in this app. I will be deleting it after using it for two of my pregnancies!

Title: Not useful
----------------------------------------------------------
Some people write questions that have nothing to do with being pregnant and all you can do is "flag as inappropriate". The same for some answers within questions: you flag them, they disappear but when you reenter the thread, they are there again. Poor layout. Constant adds. The food and medication lookups are not accurate. You click on BLT and it says you shouldn't eat it because of the cold cuts--since when are cold cuts in a BLT? But it's in red, so don't eat it people! Smh I don't recommend this app to anyone, there are others that are better.

Title: Crappy app
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve never been a big fan of the app. There is no message board (that I can find after searching the 3000 links) except a general board for everyone and their brother. On another app I‚Äôm on, I can select the December babies board and talk to people due around the same time as me! And now Ovia added this thing that literally asks you questions every time you sign onto the app and there is no way to opt out of them...you either have to waste time answering them or xing them out. I only go on 1-2 times a week but I may just delete the whole thing.

Title: Ovia sells your information
----------------------------------------------------------
Ovia sells your medical data and anything else you track or enter into the app. This also goes for Ovia fertility. There is an article about it in the Washington post. Ovia will sell your information to your employer if your employer chooses to pay and pursue it. The app is fine but don‚Äôt believe for a second that the people who work for Ovia care about your privacy or support mothers. We already have enough adversity in the workforce and, in the US, with unpaid leave. It‚Äôs unfortunate that Ovia perpetuates this by sharing private information.

Title: Unable to use due to complicated features
----------------------------------------------------------
I ovulated late in my cycle which caused me to be 2 weeks off on my due date. My ultrasound dating confirmed the actual pregnancy age. I tried to update this on the app to reflect my doctor determined due date and date of conception but the app confined to make its own adjustments. It made my period a week later, due date a week earlier, etc and so on. Very frustrating especially when I know when my period started that month but the ovulation was just off. I will be finding a new app that is not so restrictive on dates.

Title: Privacy Concern
----------------------------------------------------------
I loved the app for my first two pregnancies, but this morning I was woken up by my ex-husband congratulating me on my pregnancy. I feel slightly violated and wish there was something that prompted the user to ask if their information was still correct. Especially in situations like these where certain things may not be shared with others for an array of reasons. I am now extremely anxious and uncomfortable knowing an intimate event has now been shared with someone who I do not feel safe knowing that information.

Got so tired of the app crashing every time I opened it (it was to the point where I couldn't even use it at all anymore) that I finally just deleted the app and downloaded it, hoping that would help. I figured since I have an "account" my information would be saved. Wrong..everything gone..saved absolutely nothing not even my name! What's the point of having an account.

Title: Privacy issues
----------------------------------------------------------
I liked the app and the updates that I would receive. Recently, however, I denied them access to my photos but, somehow, they were able override that. I checked my settings to confirm that  ‚Äúnever‚Äù was still selected for photos and it was! In a time where our privacy is constantly violated, I did not appreciate that. May seem small to some, but if they‚Äôre overriding our settings and preferences to access photos, who knows what else they‚Äôre accessing without our permission. Be careful!

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for reaching out. Ovia always respects your permission settings.  Unless you have specifically granted access, Ovia does not have access to your photos.  On iOS 11+, iOS does not require a user to give an app permission to upload a single photo.  Which means even if you have not given Ovia permission to access your camera roll, you can still upload a single photo.  This setting is outside of Ovia‚Äôs control.  Please contact support@oviahealth.com if you have any additional questions.

Title: Fun for 1st and 2nd trimester only
----------------------------------------------------------
This app was full of exciting super fun information at the beginning of my pregnancy. But now that I‚Äôm in the 3rd trimester it‚Äôs literally just telling me the same facts everyday. Needless to say I‚Äôm super disappointed that it isn‚Äôt a good app for the entire pregnancy and will be deleting it. Like how many times do I need to read that my baby has an immune system that will continue to develop until after his birth? 3rd trimester expecting moms deserve exciting new facts too...

----------------------------------------------------------
I actually like this app a lot more than 5 stars but I find myself not being able to use the community.

From now on I will use the app just to check on my baby‚Äôs development and to read the articles. Any questions I have I will ask my doctor or someone I know who has kids because the moms I see on that app are rude and don‚Äôt deserve kids. Just being honest.

It has some neat features but slow to load and too many extra things. But the reason I finally just deleted it was because of the comparisons of things to the size of your baby. They were ridiculous! First, there‚Äôs too much variety in fruits and vegetables to compare them to a baby. The French bakery thing was cute, but not practical. The toy version wasn‚Äôt specific enough and weird animals not relatable.
