Title: Cancel subscription
----------------------------------------------------------
Yummly has too many ads, requires multiple clicks to get to the heart of a recipe, and profiles recipes for me that don’t fit my needs. But what is the most frustrating is trying to cancel my subscription. It’s a never ending do-loop of logging into website to access my account, then being sent an email that asks me to sign in. I have then gotten to the place to cancel my subscription, which I do, but then the website will not allow me to cancel my account until I have canceled my subscription, which I have already done (or think I’ve done). But at each step, I have to log in to website where it again sends me an email with link to sign in and I have to start all over.  It just keeps repeating. This doesn’t make any sense, does it? No. I can’t even explain what is happening because it is utter nonsense. I want to cancel my subscription and delete my account. And it doesn’t appear that I can.  So, my advice is to avoid this app at all costs. It’s a trap and there are better cooking apps out there. And if I did successfully cancel my subscription, please cancel my account.  I have tried multiple times and it just keeps telling me that I need to cancel my subscription first.  Which I tried to do.  That’s how bad this is.

Sorry for any trouble you had canceling your subscription.  Please reach out to me at Support@yummly.com and I will make sure any issues you're having are resolved.

Title: Worst Recipe App without a doubt
----------------------------------------------------------
I hated their website and app several years ago when I tried to use. But one of my dear friend sent me a recipe “Super Energy Kale Soup” via email I tried click the link and open it in my browser, ingredients comes up but when I click “get directions” , that page never stop loading and nothing comes up. I’m kind of person who have insane amount patient!! So I go to App Store and download the app, and follow through the 10 minutes worth of crap to finish signing up, then even get the pro version. I searched for the kale soup recipe and and when it came up I clicked “ get directions”, same thing happened and it opens a blank page. Now most people would give up by then, but I decided to try one more recipe to see if only that one kale recipe soup has issue, but second and third recipe same thing. I use an IPhone XR and all the software are up to date. I don’t care what million other people say, after spending 25 minutes of my life I will never get back... this is the worst recipe app or to be honest any app I have ever used. Your incompetence is nothing short of unspeakable!!

Title: Chock full of advertisements and links
----------------------------------------------------------
Unless I am delusional, Yummly used to be much better.  Today, my wife sent me a link via text and it wouldn’t even load.  I searched for it and found it manually.  Then, I had to work my way around advertisements and unrelated images like a knight dangerously navigating the evil gauntlet of death.  Eventually, I made it to the recipe and had to read far to much fluff to get to the details.  Why does this have to be so difficult?   Is armor and weapons really necessary?   Can we just get a cooking / recipe app that is easy to use, has great relative pictures without all the linking and scrolling to circumvent the advertisements I’m  not going to pay one ounce of attention to anyway.  I’d pay for an app like that. A reasonable monthly fee that is shared across a single family would be appealing.  Much unlike this current app.

Title: It's better to write down your own recipes
----------------------------------------------------------
I used this app last summer when I visited my grandmothers from both sides of my family. They taught me their homemade recipes of some of my favorite dishes! I was excited to find Yummly because I was able to save my grandmothers recipes, including how to cook them (temperatures etc). The whole process was really easy. I use iCloud to back up my phone so when I had to buy a new phone, I wasn't worried about loosing all of my recipes or any other content for that matter. WELLLLLL come to find out, after logging back into Yummly EVERY SINGLE ONE of my grandmothers recipes was DELETED!! So I no longer use Yummly for anything. Writing down my recipes is way more reliable than an app!!

Title: No sort ability, interface is clunky
----------------------------------------------------------
Am I the only person who wants my food to taste good?  Once I've found a group of recipes I want to be able to sort them by rating. Not going to waste my time making a dish that no one likes. With this app?  No sorting. Stupid. The rest of the interface is clunky and counterintuitive. I'm glad that your designers found out how to use the fancy slide features, and the accordion features, but I don't care how slick the app looks, I want to be able to find a recipe, see what's in it, and how to make it. All that other crap is secondary.  Deleting from my phone as soon as I post this review. Come back when you're app is a little more mature, Yummly.

Title: Directions Please
----------------------------------------------------------
I chose this app because I thought it would be helpful, but lately I am not sure about that.  On numerous occasions I have seen a recipe I wanted to try in your email.  It opens in the app but when directions are requested I am met with “The page you are looking for no longer exists or can't be found on our site.  Be sure to double check the link URL for any typos. Perhaps you can return back to the site's homepage and see if you can find what you are looking for. Or, you can try finding it by using the search form below.”  I have tried searching to no avail.  Perhaps you need make sure directions are available before posting in email.

Title: Excessive ads spoil this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm sure all the described features are lovely. Unfortunately I'll never know. The constant delivery of ad after ad, both interspersed within the recipes and popping up and hiding the recipes so that I have to stop every 10 seconds and find the little x to dismiss the ad, truly spoiled my first recipe search. Uninstalled within 5 minutes. Yes I looked in settings and found no way to reduce ad frequency or pay to turn them off. If the app were useful, I'd pay once to turn off ads. But I'll never know because my time is more valuable than putting up with constantly obscured content. If I could give zero stars, I would.

Title: Terrible UI/UX
----------------------------------------------------------
The pictures are great, and initially seems very appealing, but the actual usability is terrible. Try to find a recipe you like, and then add it to a saves list or collection. Guarantee for 1st time users takes you more than 5 minutes. Since, that's a main focal point of the app, that should be a red flag for whomever designed it. Make it easier to add recipes to lists--not just add ingredients for shopping. Make it more clear cut on organizing recipes, and categories. Tried to like and utilize the app more than once, and it's they try to over do it. Much better apps out there for organizing and finding recipes.

Title: Looks like a great app but the sign in is not for me
----------------------------------------------------------
This app looks great but unfortunately I'll never know. You must sign in using either google+ or Facebook. I REFUSE to get a google+ account and I personally can't stand things that MUST go through Facebook. I understand Facebook gets your product out there and gets you exposure, but there's got to be a better way. You can view recipes without the login but you cannot like them/save them, use the grocery list or get recommendations customized to your likes...which is the main "draw" to the app. Thanks guys...but you've just got to change the login methods to include a login by email or something.

Title: LATEST UPDATE/APP HORRIBLE!
----------------------------------------------------------
This used to be fantastic!  I took the update today (3/9/20) and it’s frozen 4 times and moved ridiculously slow, twice, AND THEN freezes!  I exited out and signed back in and it moved like molasses in the winter AND THEN froze. I deleted the app (lost all my previously saved recipes), created a whole new account and started searching recipes (you know where this is going, don’t you!) AND THEN it froze!  So, I’ll be deleting the app and going back to my previous ways of getting recipes and that’s by searching on the web. It’s better than whatever they did to the app.

Title: Wish ratings showed in list of recipes & directions were in the app
----------------------------------------------------------
Wish the recipe ratings showed in list of recipes. It weighs time opening each recipe to see if it’s been rated one star or five stars by however many people. Then the directions are not listed in the app, like a normal recipe is expected to have... ya know ingredients then instructions directly below 🤷‍♀️ I don’t get it. Really pitiful arrangement to instead re-direct all users, EVERY SINGLE TIME to a recipe blog website. I don’t have time to read through blogs to figure out where recipes are at when some bloggers hide them. Disappointed with Yummly’s setup.

Title: its an amazing app BUT…
----------------------------------------------------------
I love Yummly, and would’ve easily rated it 5 stars, but this latest update is just terrible. The UI changes are great, but so much now is locked behind a subscription. Many people use the app for free as it’s the best free recipes app there is. But putting things behind paywalls can drastically reduce the number of people who use this app. Nutrition information should not be locked behind a subscription. i’m perfectly fine and agreeable with having certain recipes (i.e. pro recipes) behind a subscription, but nutrition information is crossing a line.

Title: Update blows!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have loved this app ever since I discovered it. The newest update, however, has some major flaws. I'm unable to see my recent "yummed" recipes in my lists! They are nowhere to be found. Also, I'm not getting nearly as many recipe recommendations as I did with the old version! It seems to be the same 20 or so recipes it's showing me, when it used to be new ones every time I refreshed. I have also lost all my saved recipes twice now...over 300 recipes each time! It doesn't recognize my email login anymore for some frustrating reason!! Please fix!!!

Title: Terrible
----------------------------------------------------------
This is what is wrong with the internet these days. A website is built for collecting recipes. But you are forced to download an add filled app to even view the recipes. After scrolling past the life story of how someone is always reminded of the first time they met their husband over chicken wings at a super bowl party. And scroll past 40 other click-bait recipes for more football recipe favorites. You finally get to the original recipe you were looking for in the first place. Just to see what the ingredients are. Complete waste of time.

Title: Loved idea but not user friendly
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded the app and it appeared that it was going to be just what I was looking for. But when I open the app and attempted to use it it was the most difficult app I have ever encountered. At every turn I was getting bombarded with request to join or do something other than what I was there to do. I was simply trying to download a recipe which I thought I would like and it was almost impossible To do. Unless you change how your app works by moving on to another App that’s more user-friendly. I do not recommend this app to anyone

I downloaded and used once. Thought it was great I saved a bunch of recipes and started tuning my recommendations. I wanted to check out my saved recipes before I went grocery shopping by the app never finishes loading. I closed and tried again... I turned my phone off and tried again... I did an iOS update and tried again nothing works to make the app load so I can use it... a developer response would be great.. I’m going to uninstall and try one more time if the app doesn’t remember me with my account log in I will not use again

Title: iPad: app won’t allow me to sign into my account
----------------------------------------------------------
This is now the second version of the Yummly app for iPad that won’t allow me to sign into my existing account.  I can’t access my saved recipes, etc.   When I open the app, I am invited to create a new account, which is silly because I already have one.  There is no option to sign into an existing account.  That rates a “0 stars” from me, but when I try to create a new account I get the message “Oops, something went wrong”.   Altough the lowest allowed rating is 1 star, if it were possible I would give this app a negative 1.

Title: App won’t load!
----------------------------------------------------------
Ever since you updated the app to run only on iOS 13 I can’t even access the app.  I used to use it weekly, it was my go to recipe app, and I had a lot of saved ideas that I can no longer get too.  Poor game guys, some people don’t have the ability to upgrade their iPad to the new platform and still run iOS 12, so they are unable to use the app. I’ve tried deleting the app and reinstalling multiple times, but it still doesn’t completely install and therefore no Yummly for me.  I guess I have to go to AllRecipes or something.

----------------------------------------------------------
Ever since I updated the app, when I receive Recommend for You emails from Yummly & I click on the recipe it no longer takes me to the recipe. Also I sent a link to my daughter & although when she clicks on the link it takes her to the recipe, it doesn’t take me there. I have reported this to Yummly & I was advised to delete the app. This did not resolve my issue. In fact it deleted ALL the recipes I had saved over the past few years!!!  This is so annoying & I can’t believe I am the only one experiencing this issue.

----------------------------------------------------------
I used to look forward to my daily Yummly time, great ideas, great photos, but over the past several months it has been coming up very short of expectation. First, after the last two updates, most recipes have no pictures come up, just a black screen. Then as if that isn’t bad enough, when you look up recipes, many do not even come up with a result... or it is missing many versions of the Yummly of a year ago. I am starting to try and find other alternatives, I really hope they get their app together soon.

Title: To many processed food ads
----------------------------------------------------------
In the beginning I loved this app it was my go to app for cooking. But now after a year I have noticed that the first couple of recipes that appear are from their corporate sponsors and these companies just want to push their processed food items. I am now getting email about recipes from them as well. It is annoying and I am over it. Yummly just ruined their app by selling out. Good look finding decent recipes that don't market to you to buy processed food items. Real food yummly not fake food. Very sad.

Title: Food restrictions
----------------------------------------------------------
Well, I have a few food intolerances that are I have to be serious about avoiding. When I downloaded the app, it asks about the things you cannot eat. The first two recipes I open up after it “searched recipes to fit my tastes and needs” both had two of the three ingredients that make me very sick. I downloaded it because it’s marketed as customizable and it was the opposite of that right out of the gate! I was so exited to have an app that showed me only recipes I didn’t have to worry about modifying. 😡

This app has a range of recipes but no single search facility as far as I can see. There are a number of really annoying features: it has so many ads popping up all the time it is impossible to read a recipe without inadvertently hitting one of the very annoying pop ups; there are no metric measurements! Come on guys, who on earth bakes with 10 tablespoons of butter! Even the use of cup measures is so imprecise and variable. Pity because there are a number of interesting recipes.

Title: App crashing constantly with latest update
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been a Yummly user for years and love the convenience of this app for turning recipes easily into my shopping list. With the most recent update the app is slow to load my shopping list and I’m lucky if I can get it to work without crashing while trying to see what produce I needed to buy. I can no longer get the app to clear my shopping list either so it’s about a mile long at this point. It was so troublesome on my most recent grocery run that I’m now searching for another app.

Title: Sad & Disgusting
----------------------------------------------------------
This use to be my most absolute favorite cooking app, but that is no longer the case. I’m the worst cook and this app provided an overall FREE means of looking of recipes and methods in which to cook these meals. Not only that, there were videos in case you really struggled. Now this platform has become very greedy and charges you a subscription to utilize these tools. This is sad and I’m lead to believe this app will quickly lose their rank as the best recipe/cooking app very quickly.

----------------------------------------------------------
On first use, this app is actually pretty good. You can search for recipes and add ingredients to a shopping list. But the dietary preferences are limiting and don't offer many choices. I tried searching for cauliflower Mac and cheese recipe. There are a ton of recipes out there but this app couldn't find even one! That's ridiculous! And I could barely find any recipes for LCHF. If they could allow importing of recipes from the web and meal planning this app would be a much better.

Downloaded app and signed up/in. Few days later I received an email from them about cauliflower breadsticks, which looked good, so I clicked it to open in the app to see the actual recipe and all the App did repeatedly, four times, was open up the App Store to a casino app to download. After a few attempts, I was able to access the settings section of the app and signed out. It then asked me to rate it...big mistake! Junk app with way too many bugs and redirects to unwanted apps.

I love the look of the recipes but then opening and saving the recipes becomes so complicated.  Sometimes you have to sign up to another site to actually download the recipe and I have not figured out a way to save the recipes I like simply.  I am not computer illiterate and the fact that there isn't a simple button to press to save is beyond me. I have spent way too much time trying to figure out how to work this app, more time than I have. It's a pity, the recipes look great.

Title: Ignores dietary preferences
----------------------------------------------------------
The app actively asked me during the personalization process what dietary restrictions I had (gluten and wheat) and other foods I wanted to avoid. Then it calculated what recipes to serve me in the “For You” section… and they were majority gluten-filled recipes. I double checked my dietary preference settings, and sure enough, they had me down as no gluten and wheat. Do not use this app if you have any restrictions because they will be ignored, and you’ll pay for the pleasure.

I will get emails from Yummly about new recipes. Once I click on it I get transferred to a web browser and at the top is a link to install the app. I already have the app and it should automatically bring me to that app. So I’ll click anyway and then I get to the app. But where’s the recipe I wanted to see in the first place. Back in the web browser. So if I really want to see the recipe and possibly save it I need to search for it. Yummly can do better because other app are.

----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for screwing up the app design guys! Now instead of a forgot password button, they offer a “sign in through email” option, which then lets you tap a button on an email to sign in on your phone. However the button doesn’t work so you can only sign in through the phone browser. When you go to songs to change your password it requires you to enter the old one which you forgot, and if you try to navigate around this it just loops you around and around. Very frustrating!

I've spent a lot of time yumming and categorizing recipes and for the past week or so, it won't let me in the app (iPhone 6 / iOS 9.2). It gets stuck in the sign-in screen and when I press "Continue with Facebook" nothing happens although it used to work just fine. Same if I go to an external recipe site and try adding to my Yums; it tells me that I don't have a Yummly account which is clearly not true. The website seems to work just fine. Please fix your mobile app!

----------------------------------------------------------
I have used the Yummly app for a long time, and I have always loved it.  That is until the last couple of updates, now there are so many issues.  When I try to use the search function the app closes out completely.  If I look at a recipe and the go back out to the main screen, it automatically refreshes the screen, changing the recipes I can see.  I am seriously wondering if I should just delete the app and see if I can find another one.  Fix the issues, please!

This used to be my favorite app but now with all the changes with the new update the recipes often stop loading. Or if I do manage to find one I like I try to read the directions and the page will refresh and send me back up to the top. That makes it so I can't even read the directions. This happens over and over until I finally give up. I LOVE the recipes on this app, I love the search, and the categories, but what good is any of that if it can't be utilized?

This app represents that it covers all sorts of cultural recipes but they don't have much except mostly pasta dishes and chicken dishes.

Title: Yummly review
----------------------------------------------------------
I have had this App for a few years and had many saved recipes. Last week when I attempted to open the App to check a saved recipe it locked up and wouldn’t open. A window popped up to download “the newest version “ which I did because I wanted to review the recipe. Once it was downloaded I opened the App and found no saved recipes. I lost all of them. This new App is not user friendly. I most likely will just google recipes if I can’t get this App to work.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for taking your time to reach out to us in regards to this issue. Please accept my sincerest apologies for the trouble. Your saved recipes are directly associated with the account you originally signed up with. It sounds like these aren't quite the recipes you're looking for.

Title: It doesn't work anymore!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I upgraded my phone in July to a 6 Plus from a 5S and not only did it delete all of my lists, but it also stopped working all together. It would only crash and crash and crash. You have no idea how frustrated I am with this because I loved this app. I loved everything about this app. I have tried deleting it and redownloading but it didn't work. This newest update said that there would be 6 and 6+ compatibility but alas it still doesn't work!

Title: Used to be the best app, now not so much
----------------------------------------------------------
It does not work. It doesn't let me search for recipes. When you type in the search for anything, nothing works. But if you want anything paid, of course, it would work because it's paid. It used to be my go-to app for everything but it’s unusable. I lost everything I had. My recipes, my saved shopping list, everything with every single update because they want you to buy a top chef, or subject yourself to something you don't want. USELESS.

Title: Sign in issue
----------------------------------------------------------
This app sort of did work until past couple of weeks. I dislike having to sign in each time. It’s a lengthy process.  Past couple of weeks I have not been able to get in app because of the sign in process.  When I go through the email verification process and into the website I have to sign in and start the process all over again.  Can’t get into the app.  Why do I need to sign into an app just to view recipes.  Am I doing something wrong?

Title: Poor design
----------------------------------------------------------
I needed this app while I was at the store today since it was is the day before thanksgiving. I decided to trust it to store the recipes I wanted for thanksgiving. To my surprise the server was down. Causing me to have to do searches for these recipes and was a huge waste of time. I even forgot a recipe I needed and had to run back out. Will not be trusting this website anymore and will be storing backup files which shouldn't be necessary.

Title: Want to love this, but...
----------------------------------------------------------
I have legitimate food sensitivities that lead to visible mouth sores among other things. I was thrilled to find and app, which would exclude specific food items. It does not. Recommended recipes consistently have the two foods I avoid. A second complaint: the app is not intuitive. I love the idea of the convenience of an app finding recipes with the foods I have on hand as advertised and have yet to be able to find it on the app. Blah.

----------------------------------------------------------
I found a recipe online I wanted to view but it wouldn't let me without downloading the app. I finally decided to get the app to see the recipe. When I opened it up it wanted personal info. I skipped that because I just wanted to view the recipe!!! The recipe popped up but when I tried to open it, it disappeared and about a hundred other recipes appeared! Could you make it any harder just to look at a recipe? I will be deleting the app.

----------------------------------------------------------
I “used” Yummly almost weekly and loved it for its ease an ability to scan multiple recipes for ideas and recipes. This NEW AND IMPROVED version totally hurls!! I DO NOT want an App that literally wants my entire eating history!! I tried to skip to “Use this App without Personalization” and it just locks up my iPad(iOS 12.4.1). I’ve downloaded The Food Network’s In The Kitchen an it will now become my “Go-To” for cooking inspirations.

You have no control on the search is it forces you to go through a list of things that aren’t even a consideration for what you’re looking for I cannot upload it and save it on my phone it has a lot of promise and it sure is pretty but it’s not very functional and it definitely is nowhere near user-friendly.  I’ve tried to reach the source of this to get information in there was zero help. Do not get yourself locked into this program

used to love this app, but their support team is a joke. certain recipes get ‘stuck’ and are unable to be removed from your saved recipes which is really annoying if you made the recipe and didn’t like it. rather than removing those recipes from the app/website since there is a glitch, they want USERS to delete their accounts with hundreds of recipes they’ve saved, and make new accounts, and READD all their previously saved recipes.

----------------------------------------------------------
According to Yummly’s app features, it supports Family Sharing. However, my daughter on my family sharing plan, under my Apple ID, and she purchased the Pro Version. Unfortunately, it will not allow me access to Pro recipes.  A pop up prompts me to subscribe for Pro access and when I click YES , it tells me I’ve already subscribed 😩Both of us have Gamily Sharing AND Share Subscriptions turned on. How do we resolve this problem?????

Why does every search bring up results for janky recipes containing Pillsbury crescent rolls? I searched for “beef stew” and the top 2 results were for “Beef enchilada crescents” and “Crescent Beef Burritos.” The non-crescent exception was when i searched “tuna salad” and the only 2 results were for a roasted bell pepper dish containing no tuna whatsoever and poke lettuce cups. I ain’t got the time to figure out this goony app.

----------------------------------------------------------
You can search for 100s of recipes very easily and you’ll find some that seem really great. You can see the list of ingredients you’ll need and the nutritional information. Here’s the catch...when you click “see the directions”, you’re only going to see “sign up for some free prize” crap or “you need to download this VPN” crap and, unless you do that, you’re not going to see the recipe! Find another app! This is not the one!

I hate when I go to a site and am force to HUNT down the particular thing that drew me to the sight in the first place.  I selected a photo because it looked amazingly delicious and then spent the next 15 minutes scrolling to find it.  NEVERY FOUND IT!  I gave up looking.  So the site is definitely not helpful at all.  It has tickled my taste buds but left me standing out here drooling with no recipe in sight.  That stinks!

I am not a lab rat. This advertisement driven app simply want you to jump through (One too many) hoops for every morsel you get. If you don't do "A" you don't get "B". If you don't do "C" you certainly won't get to "D". I don't know about you but if I'm going shopping for ingredients I certainly don't want my time (standing in the grocery store) spent plunging through time-consuming advertisements.

Have had requests to login in the past updates but could choose to not and still use the app now apparently you can’t access your past saved recipes.

I have downloaded and deleted this app about 20 times. The link has never worked and the website is so overloaded with ads that getting to the recipe is almost impossible. All The Recipes is easier to navigate, doesn’t bombard you with advertisements and is much more user friendly. You actually tap the recipe you want and get instructions to make the dish. I would try the All The Recipes app before trying this one.

I’ve had the Yummly app for many years. Now they won’t let me access any of the recipes I saved without paying for a subscription. I should have been grandfathered in or at least I could have saved my recipes before it kicked me out. I’ve told lots of people about this app and now I can’t use it. I’m sure there’s others. Maybe I would have paid, but the way this was done was sneaky and not right. Very unsatisfied.

Yummly is another innocent acting app that makes its living off controlling other peoples content. Other people submit recipes and Yummly almost forces you to download their app to access the recipes. You get inundated with junk and scrolling through nonsense on an endless journey to try and find theactual recipe until you just give in. I find it distasteful not yummly at all.  Bad unethical business as well.

Title: IF I could give it ZERO stars I would
----------------------------------------------------------
This app’s performance on the iPad is so poor as to make it completely UNUSABLE. Responses to taps in the interface are either interminably slow or completely non-responsive. IF it responds AT ALL when you pull up a recipe and click “Get Directions,” it takes you to a recipe website filled with a bunch of useless prose and pop-up ads before you FINALLY find the DIRECTIONS to make the recipe. Uninstalling....

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi Chef, Thank you for taking your time to notify us of this issue. I'm really sorry that the app is giving you so much trouble! This is definitely not the type of experience we want you to have on Yummly. Can you give it a try deleting the app from your device and then reinstalling it to see if this helps resolve the issue? We don't list the directions directly on our site so that we can give proper credit to the site where the recipe originated, while still offering unique search filters and ways to find these recipes from different food sites all over the web.

Title: Now Have to pay for pro to get all recipes. Didn’t before.
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve had this app for couple years now and I’ve loved it. I don’t always use it couple times a month when looking for something new and different. Went to use it today and some of the recipes tell me I have to upgrade to pro for monthly fee now. Forget that I’ll just google recipes instead. ITS FREE TO GOOGLE AND get the SAME RECIPES come. So I won’t be using this app anymore. Stupid idea to charge money.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi Chef, Thank you for using Yummly, and for writing in with your experience. I apologize for any inconvenience that this has caused. While we did recently release these new Yummly Pro recipes, they are actually a relatively small number of recipes relative to the amount of recipes available to you in Yummly. You can still use Yummly just as before, searching and saving millions of recipes for free. We will be releasing an update where the Pro recipes are labeled as well, so that you can more easily identify them. I hope that you will continue to use Yummly in the meantime. If you ever have other suggestions, or questions, we would love to hear them! You can always reach me directly at support@yummly.com

Ive been using Yummly for as long as Ive had an IPad I think, and I have always loved it.  However this newest iteration is very disappointing.  The new look is nice, unfortunately when I click on any recipe either from the home screen, my recipes, or from a search, the program freezes up.  Ive downloaded it several times to no avail. So my recipes are now held hostage.  Guess Ill have to use Tasty.

Developer Response:

We have not exactly figured out why some users are having these issues and others are not, but in the spirit of getting you back into your Yummly app as soon as possible, we have made the old version of the app, version 4.7, available again in the app store.  Go into the App store and make sure that you are downloading version 4.7, and you can sign back in with your same credentials to access your old account.

Yummy has good recipes, but I find it’s directions listed on a separate page from the ingredients annoying. Why they put additional hoops/clicks to jump through to use their recipes seems unnecessarily manipulative.  I avoid using recipe sites which force you to view what they consider “features” of their product like stories and unnecessary clicks instead of the list of ingredients and directions.

----------------------------------------------------------
I used to love this app but they couldn’t leave it alone. Now when I open it there is a message to upgrade it. But it isn’t thru the App Store and seems to be a dead end. I try to update on my iPad within the app but it freezes. It won’t update and it won’t go to the recipes. There is no update available in the App Store.  So it is now useless.

Title: This is literally a waste
----------------------------------------------------------
You are wasting ur time don’t download this app every recipe looks disgusting but not only that every recipe isn’t even real you could follow it step for step and you will see it’s not a legit recipe. This app is a joke I cannot believe this is the first recipe app that comes up in the App Store it’s literally a shame to cooking. Failure here.

Title: Totally disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is ridiculous. When you find a recipe you like it encourages you to download the app. Now every time I try to open the app it wants me to give it my email to get permission to open it. Then it takes over an hour to receive the confirmation. I’m deleting it now and will look at other free websites. I’m tired of dealing with this one.

Title: Infinity loop
----------------------------------------------------------
Seems like a nice app but the iOS app never gets beyond “check your email”. All I can do is click on “resend confirmation email”. Upon receiving the email I click on the appropriate link which then sends me right back to “check your email”. It works fine in a web browser as well as on AppleTV so there’s no fatfingering on my side.  Buggy!!

Title: Used to be good…
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to LOVE this app. Now it crashes every time I try to sign in! What happened??? All of my saved recipes are gone. This app used to be the best app ever now it signs me out of my account every time I open it and if I try to sign back in it just crashes. I’m so upset with it. Please fix this. Right now I’d give it 0 stars if I could.

Hi Chef, Thank you for taking your time to notify us of this issue. I'm really sorry that the app is giving you so much trouble! This is definitely not the type of experience we want you to have on Yummly. Can you give it a try to delete the app from your device and then reinstalling it to see if this helps resolve the issue? If you continue to run into trouble after giving this a try, please email me at support@yummly.com.

Title: Too many advertisements!
----------------------------------------------------------
A beautiful app and seems to have a lot of yummy recipes.  Only problem is the amount of ads and I can't navigate through the recipes without accidentally clicking on them. Also, the Screen refreshes and moves so much it becomes frustrating. As a result I don't us the app and will most likely end up deleting it from my iPhone altogether.

Title: Way, way, hard to find recipe
----------------------------------------------------------
Signing up is a challenge, finding recipes is nearly impossible, etc, etc, etc. What used to be a reliable recipe site has to have throw everything into making a fantastic site. Sometimes it’s better to keep it simple. I recommend New York Times Cooking site because it was designed by more expert designers than Yum apparently did. Fail!

Title: Filled with annoying advertisements and poor navigation
----------------------------------------------------------
Constantly prompts for personal info to drive advertising.  Received links from other Yummly users (via text) opens Yummly website containing link promising to open in app. But app opens with no clue on default home page. Hard to scroll and imbedded recipes from other sources maintain nested advertisers and disruptive videos.  Useless.

Title: Stop with the upsell!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app, or used to love it. It was simple and straightforward. But the developer ruined it. Every time you open it it asks to purchase a smart thermometer. I get the occasional ad but every single time is excessive. Once you’ve asked me a hundred times, it’s pretty clear I don’t want a smart thermometer. Please stop asking me.

Title: Does Not Work
----------------------------------------------------------
I cannot get this app to work. When I try connecting with FaceBook I’m given an error saying, “Issue connecting with this account”. So I go to try with email. When I enter my email and hit next, the text field freaks out and spins up and down. So then I just try without even making an account and it won’t even let me skip passed this.

Title: No search function
----------------------------------------------------------
I hate the new app. There’s no search function. (If there is and I’m overlooking it, then shame on you. It’s not the user’s fault they can’t navigate your site, it’s yours). I don’t care about what’s trending locally or otherwise. The diets category is a nice feature. But still, no search, I’m out. Deleting this app and unsubscribing.

Title: Love Lost
----------------------------------------------------------
Used to love this app, but since recent update all recipes come through from food.com so I am assuming maybe they own it. Many of contributors are now gone and when I search for a recipe like breakfast bar there is no way to differentiate recipes. They are all from food.com with the same name. I am now looking for another recipe app.

Title: FIX IT!
----------------------------------------------------------
Crashes immediately upon trying to open. And I can't even use safari to go to the website without it constantly trying to redirect me to the app which won't even open. And because of that I can't even view the list of recipes, or the recipe itself. So either way I'm screwed. I'm really upset cause I use this app on a regular basis.

Title: Lose the instructional videos for recipes!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to adore Yummly until they started videos for a lot of their recipes.  I just want access to the recipe please!!!  As an experienced cook, I do not need or want a time wasting instructional video.  At least consider giving subscribers the option of choice between weather or not they want an instructional video of a recipe.

Title: DO NOT SIGN UP!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Do not sign up for this service. If you ever decide to opt out of emails, they will not let you. I have signed into my account multiple time and set it not to receive any email but I still receive emails almost on a daily basis. I have now resorted to deleting my account completely and hopefully that will stop all the junk mail.

Title: I loved Yummly before
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been using Yummly for years and it has been my go to place for meal ideas. With the latest update they took away the ability to add a meal to my calendar and replaced it with the meal plan feature that requires monthly payment at the premium tier. That’s a pretty basic feature and should have been left at the basic level.

----------------------------------------------------------
I searched for pork loin with lemon and pork tenderloin with lemon.  The search came up with a comment “we searched the whole worldwide web and came up with nothing”.  I used Big Oven and Google and came up with lots of recipes.  I tried the search several times in Yummly in different ways and nothing.  The new app is useless.

----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded app to browse for recipes. I am aware that adds are necessary but with the latest update 3/19, I am now required to have an account in which under the terms of service my data is now “mined”. I am not opposed to adds but I should be able to use a Yummly with generic adds and NOT have my data use handed over. FAIL!

I got this app to work with my iPhone so that I could use it while shopping in the store. It works with my iPad and my computer but not my iPhone.It will not let me sign into the app on my iPhone. I was going to pay for the annual subscription but I deleted the app because if I can’t sign in on my iPhone it is not very useful.

----------------------------------------------------------
I clicked on a link for Ina Garten Brunch recipes on Yummly. Rather than a list of recipes, I was asked a series of questions to determine what I was looking for. Only one of the resulting recipes was by Ina Garten and it was for cupcakes. This is the second time I’ve used the Yummly app and neither time was I successful.

Title: Can't log in via Facebook
----------------------------------------------------------
I have a profile on this app when I signed up using fb over a year ago.  Now for the past 6 months including today I cannot log in on my phone via fb and it's very annoying.  All the recipes, my profile, my preferences...all gone.  I'm assuming it's not just me and its been long enough for this to have been fixed/updated.
