Title: Makes cooking fun...!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
After having supper on the table at 5:30 except during ball season for over 30yrs cooking had become a chore that I hated. I'm a very good southern cook and that includes fixing my share of fried foods, cornbread homemade biscuits gravy every week, we were all healthy, not overweight & took no meds for any medical conditions related to diet. Once my children were grown & gone I went through the "stop & pick something up" stage. Within 2-3 years my husband was on BP meds, I was on cholesterol meds & had gained weight along with other medical issues. Then I stumbled upon this App & I couldn't believe all the great recipes!! How good they looked & how easy they were to keep track of & how fixing them didn't feel like a chore!! I was not only enjoying cooking again but I was coming up with reasons to cook. Yes I'm still cooking southern food of course but also things I'd never made or even heard of before!! I didn't cook us a special meals for our medical issues or our weight gain but it didn't take long for the weight to come off & for the RXs to be discontinued. I believe it's because we were eating less preservatives & junks food. Yes I still fry, I make cobblers & bake all those wonderful southern dishes, cakes & pies. It's probably easier to say I cook whatever looks good. I keep a lot of folders. You'll figure out what works for you but I have 2-3 special folders I'd suggest. One for quick meals (some of those even go in the crockpot frozen). A "favorites" folder and a "don't make again" folder for the few we didn't like. Definitely give it a try. I really believe even if your kids are still home, cooking will not feel like a chore that you just dread. But you'll enjoy it again & hopefully will get your kids in there with you helping. I love when my grandchildren are here & ask to help me!! I just absolutely LOVE this App..!!! I wrote this review 2-3 years ago and I just wanted to say that I STILL love this app and I still love cooking!! I suggested that you use folders and still believe that‚Äôs the best way to go. I have several Favs, Crockpot Meats, Crockpot Meals, Holidays, Grilling, Tailgating etc. As my grandchildren got older and started cooking more, I made one for them that includes complete meals, sandwiches, snacks etc...

Title: Best Recipe App for All kinds of people
----------------------------------------------------------
I love Yummly, I don‚Äôt remember how I found out about it. But it has been a lifesaver, it‚Äôs great to save recipes I find online that I want to look at later and not get lost in the bookmark section of my phone. It‚Äôs also good for a vegan like me to find recipes, but also serving size and nutrition facts.I scan look at all the  egan recipes in one place instead of looking them up online and finding out it isn‚Äôt vegan. Plus I can look for recipes using certain ingredients I have laying around. They have such a inclusive dietary preference all types of vegetarians, paleo, plus all kinds of allergies. They have now guided videos, I‚Äôll check those out soon and see what they‚Äôre like. I honestly can‚Äôt think of anything to complain about. It‚Äôs a useful tool for me and one of the must-have food apps on my phone.  All the other exclusively  vegan recipe apps , or just general apps are overpriced and don‚Äôt do half the things Yummly does or if they do you have to pay a ridiculous subscription fee. The best part it is all free! Not a free app with a lot limitations on certain recipes, but there‚Äôs a premium membership with access to over thousand of recipes and videos. Or it‚Äôs a free trial , it‚Äôs actually legitimately free, I mean it has prompted recipes from brand companies but its clearly labeled. Plus I mean the app has to be paid for somehow. If that‚Äôs the only ads I‚Äôve got to deal with, I‚Äôll take it!

Title: Yummly in my tummly
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using the Yummly app for a few years now.  I can find every recipe I am searching for, and believe me it has come in handy.  In the last year I‚Äôve switched diets from Mediterranean to Vegan to Keto, now I‚Äôm low carb.  All the while I‚Äôm gluten free.  The app makes it easy to obtain allergy free recipes and recipes geared toward my diet.  I also receive emails from Yummly.  Just before Christmas I receive cool kitchen recommendations.  I may put some items on my Christmas list for me or buy items for my friends and family.  I am an avid gardener and sometimes need fresh new ideas for an over abundance of vegetables or fruits.  With Yummly I can search the vegetables name and find all sorts of recipes.  This year I canned my very own tomato sauce with a Yummly recipe!   I also learned how to cut a whole chicken in half and roast it!  The amount of ‚ÄúYums‚Äù on each recipe make it simple for me to chose what recipe I want to try if multiple recipes pop up under my search. I‚Äôm rating Yummly 5 stars because I can always find an outstanding recipe to suit my and my family‚Äôs needs.

Title: I love this app!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
The design of this app is awesome. It manages to pull recipes from many sources smoothly, and it‚Äôs great about searching specific ingredients/certain types of meals. It consolidates all the recipe info in a clean, straightforward way, so when you spot something you want to try you can quickly see nutritional info, ingredients, prep time etc. from the app, without having to scroll through the actual site the recipe was posted on trying to find all that information (if you choose to make the meal you will THEN go to the full recipe site for the directions, but it‚Äôs still from within the app). It lets you create different lists, which I really like, and you can even tell it to create shopping lists for you based on the recipe you‚Äôve picked. You can also tell it what ingredients you have on hand and it‚Äôll will give you recipes that you can make using those ingredients, or what time you plan on eating something. It will give you reminders on when to start prepping the meal if you give it a time. So cool.

Title: Amazing, so many good features
----------------------------------------------------------
Yummly is a great app. I have found so many recipes on the app that I never would have found otherwise! If you aren‚Äôt sure about a recipe, just look at the reviews for the recipe. Reviewing recipes is honestly such a good idea, as most recipe-filled websites or apps don‚Äôt have such features, meaning that you have no idea if the food will turn out well. You can save the recipes, which is another great feature. Find a recipe you would like to try? Just save it so you don‚Äôt have to go back and find it later. If you are planning on making several different things at the same time, you can add the ingredients you need to the shopping list on Yummly, sorted by category of foods. When you first log on to Yummly, the user can choose what foods they dislike, what they are allergic to, if they are on any diets, and what kinds of dishes they enjoy preparing. This filters the recipes you see, and you can then find more recipes you would like. Yummly is my #1 choice as a baker and chef.

Title: So personalized!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love Yummly. I've recommended it to classmates and family. When you get the app, it asks you about what food you like to eat, how many people you're cooking for, what foods you don't like, and your cooking level (I'm a beginner). This app makes it easy to save recipes so they're "yum'd" for later. It's also easy to organize them into categories such as breakfast, dinner, snacks, desserts, or your own personalized categories such as vegetarian or appetizers. This app has made me want to cook more and there are so many delicious recipes that are easy to access and retrieve when you need them. I also love how fast and easy it is to save something by clicking "yum."  Highly recommend this app. Please don't change. I do wish that I could save some of the videos though. I occasionally watch recipe videos and I can't always go back to find them. That's one request that I'd like to make. Good work and fantastic app!

Title: Wow
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm updating this review because I have even more awesome to share! First-I rarely write reviews but this app deserves it. I've finally discovered the singular app that curates all of my favorite recipes, creates shopping lists and keeps the above organized for easy reference! Ahhh! I love this app so much! Can create as many "categories" (think "boards" on Pinterest) for my recipes and most important, like Pinterest, it's a visual based app! I scroll through PHOTOS of the recipes I've added! Score! I typically visit sites like TheKitchn or Martha Stewart or pioneer woman for tried and true excellent recipes- this app lets me search all of those AND recommends like recipes. I finally have my inspiration for cooking 3 meals at home again. When we can make your own biscuits, your own brisket tacos and your own ice cream and make everyone in your house happy-- why leave the house for food ever again?!? Xo

Title: Love it!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using blue apron for a while because I was so busy with work, but decided to try meal planning on my own to allow more flexibility and for us to pick meals more suited to my family's dietary needs. I tried a couple different meal planning apps but they were either too limited in recipe finding or too structured and took too long to set up. I found yummly and love it!! It's UI is so intuitive and beautiful compared to other meal planning sites. Plus the recipe searching is second to none - you pick up food blogs, traditional food/recipe sites and all with very powerful filtering. Than you can create you shopping list and just buy what you need. The only feature I wish it had was a way to organize the meal plan for the week so you could put together the entrees and sides you pick, but I somewhat got around that by creating a new collection for the specific week.  Awesome app!!

Title: Great!
----------------------------------------------------------
It‚Äôs the best free recipe app! You can save recipes to different categories. The app starts you off with some categories, but you can create your own categories that make sense to you so that you can easily find what you have a taste for. You can click on ingredients right from the recipe, & they go to your shopping list which is organized by type (produce, meat, etc.). You can check it off in the app as you buy it, but it doesn‚Äôt disappear. It just moves to a completed section of your list, then you delete it when you want. In the shopping list, it also tells you what recipe the ingredient is for, AND you can get to the recipe right from the specific ingredient in your shopping list. ü§ó There are SO many recipes too AND different recipes for (ways to make) the same dish. Some recipes for a dish may be easier or have a different twist. There is so much possibility.

Title: Love Yummly recipes!! My son requires lactose and whey free recipes
----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks to apps like Yummly, I can quickly find peer reviewed yummy recipes for my son that has severe lactose intolerance which includes whey and powdered milks. He is essentially "allergic" to milk proteins, but can tolerate a few items. If we list milk as an allergy on his medical records he will be totally screwed for any future hospitalizations so we keep it at an intolerance so I could always cook for him at the Ronald mc Donald house and bring him food. The cafeteria isn't great about making diary free foods that are appealing to a 3 year old with eating issues that has Down Syndrome and Severe Down Syndrome.  This app is a lifesaver. Thanks.  You all rock. If anyone reads this and is in a similar boat, but is further along and could help me out. Or is just starting this journey and wants to get info like me, feel free to contact me at alienjenn at yahoo

Title: Great App! Plus it's free!
----------------------------------------------------------
I never write apps but I had to for this because it has had such a positive impact on me! I have tried many meal planning apps and this is by far my favorite. It asks your likes/dislikes any special diet you may be paleo, etc. Then it suggests recipes or you can search.  I have a hard time finding recipes that my kiddos will eat and this app has helped so much! They are trying new things and so are we! We are also eating healthier thanks to the healthy option of recipes!It has brought us all to the family table again. Another perk is that once you find a recipe you like you add it to your "yum" box and you can pick the ingredients you need to make the recipes and it adds it to a grocery list! Awesome! Hope you give it a try it really has taken lots of stress outta my life with the constant wondering what I am gong to fix for the week. This makes it so easy!

Title: This app got me to start cooking!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was telling myself that I will start cooking more for months... There were times where I would cook for a week and then it would wane for a couple weeks because I wasn‚Äôt really sure what I was capable of cooking. Looking at food blogs was becoming tiresome because I wasn‚Äôt really sure what I was looking for... Enter: Yummly. I downloaded the app after seeing an ad on Instagram and I was immediately hooked. The UI is super intuitive and and satisfying to use. I can simply just type in what I‚Äôm in the mood for (e.g., ‚Äúchicken breast‚Äù) and then I have a plethora of diverse recipe options to choose from. It is so simple to browse through recipes on the bus, find something I‚Äôm in the mood for, add the ingredients to my shopping list with the click of a button, and then use the app as I walk around the store to ensure I get everything. Highly recommend!!!

Title: Time, Space & Money-saving
----------------------------------------------------------
Yummly is my very own, ever-expanding, lightweight, recipe 'book' that I carry everywhere to explore & create healthy family meals at a moment's notice!  I now have an entire pantry shelf available for food/storage items instead of a massive, 55-year, international collection of cooking & recipe books (I've donated them all to Christian school-charity garage sales, Goodwill & Salvation Army).  The Search Feature for a broad range of recipes that contain the item(s) you already have in the fridge is The Best Feature of Yummly (besides the fact that it's a Free app); followed closely by the Shopping List Feature that saves time in quickly checking off the items you need, against what you already have at home; and, helps you keep focus off of costly 'snack-attack' extras strategically placed in the store.  In short, Yummly is a Great Blessing to me.

----------------------------------------------------------
I never agree to write reviews for apps but this one deserves it. I love this app! I use it every single day for at least one meal if not more ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòã Yummly has the most amazing options and filters. It coordinates how long the prep and cooking take and can even add a reminder to your phone calendar to notify you of when to begin your meal based off the time you want to serve it. It lets you select if you have a food allergy and will choose recipes without that. It lets you list foods or ingredients you dislike and will choose receives without those. It has an option to let you list what ingredients you might have laying in your refrigerator or pantry and will show you a recipe with those ingredients. And it even lets you take pictures of food/ingredients and will help you identify them to choose a recipe based off that. Great app. Thank you!!!

Title: Love this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app for probably around 7 years now. Definitely my go-to app for recipes. This app makes it super easy to find what you‚Äôre looking for by asking questions like what kind of protein you want in your dish, desired cooking time, number of ingredients, type of ingredients, dietary restrictions, etc. in order to filter the recipes. When you find recipes you want to save for later, you can create categories (I have one called ‚ÄúRecipes for Dad‚Äù where I save easy recipes that I know he can make) or use the ones that come with the app (breakfast, lunch, dinner) to sort them. The recipes always show a rating and written reviews from people who have made them. I find this extremely helpful in deciding which recipes to make and how to alter them based on reviews. Overall, this app is super bomb and I recommend it to everyone!

Title: Holy convenience
----------------------------------------------------------
I used the app for a couple of days, thought it was pretty sweet that you can make a shopping list from your saved recipes, but wished I could hide recipes with high sodium/millions of calories... So I send support some feedback thinking maybe if enough people suggested it they might change things in the future. Turns out I'm just an idiot. They emailed me back the same day and told me where the filters were, right under the search function. I says to myself, "well that's nice, but I'll bet you don't have one for slow cookers, or prep time..." Open up the app and check it out, shazam; filter by fat, cholesterol, calories, cooking methods, prep time, carbs, salt, bitterness, sweetness, meal course, what tv show it pairs with, you get the idea. They've thought of it all. Just quit reading this and get the app already. It's good.

üòèI love this app!! My favorite in fact!! It has allll the recipes you need because it pulls from the vastness of almost every recipe app I love PLUS the Internet etc. I love the shopping list and scanner abilities and the fact that you can even scan an item and see what you can make with it since it shows you related recipes. It's gorgeous as well - I love the formatting. My only thing is that sometimes when rapidly yumming things üòé I sometimes wish that there was a quicker way to select the type of yum that it is ie: breakfast dinner drink side etc and I wish the order stayed the same everytime you go to do that or at least have a smart feature that does that for you?? Or maybe it's just perfect the way it is! üíõüíôüíúüíö‚ù§ I literally have never left this kind of comment/review on any app before ever. Good job Yummly !!!

----------------------------------------------------------
Right away when you get the app it gives you a quiz about foods you prefer and don‚Äôt prefer, if you have any food allergies, or if you are on a diet. You can always change these in settings. There is a home page of foods the app thinks you would like and an explore page if you want to try new things. There is also a search bar. All of the recipes have the nutritional facts and tell you how long it takes to make. You can also set a reminder on the app of when you would like to start preparing your meal. You can give the recipes reviews and comments. You can also save the foods you want to make and there is even a way to organize your saved recipes.  You can even make a shopping list on the app and there is a spot on the app where it tells you of good cooking tools you can buy from different brands. Love this app!

Title: Great app for those who love to cook
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is really fantastic. As a young person who is just beginning to enjoy the love of cooking, I use this a lot. I am constantly using this all to find new recipes. Or if I pick something up at the store that is on sale, I immediately use this app to find a recipe to use it in. Also, as a vegetarian it is great for finding recipes that contain items that contain item necessary for a vegetarian diet such as eggs, beans, etc. I usually get bored with food quickly so I use this app to try 1 or 2 new recipes a week. I also enjoy the "pantry" feature which tells me exactly what to shop for when shopping for new recipes to try. In general, this app is fun, easy to navigate, great for nutritionalists, or those who are just looking for an easier way to cook. Definitely get this if you like to cook.

I love this app and have been using it to plan my weekly meals.  I love the emphasis on the pics - i.e. scrolling through pics to choose the recipe you'd like.  I love the shopping list, which I just used for the first time this weekend.  It is very easy to use.  I saw a comment once where someone thought it was difficult to go through your "yums" once you have a large amount, but that is easily manageable if you just categorize things as you "yum" them - ex. label something as dinner, lunch, drink, etc.  They also let you create your own labels which is nice.  I've created a label called "this week".  I put all of my meals for the week in that category so it's easy to add them to the shopping list and also easy to find them once you are ready to cook them!   Love this app!!

----------------------------------------------------------
Even if cooking is not your forte, this app will draw you in with its simplicity and beautiful pictures. In the beginning you'll set up your own personal profile and let Yummly know if you have certain food allergies, what foods you like, what foods you don't like. They also have all the categories..,.Mexican, Japanese, Mediterranean, vegan, it's all there. You can also choose your recipes depending on how difficult they are to make. If needed, you can choose recipes which are more simple to make, or try intermediate or more difficult recipes for a challenge. I love that you can add all the items to a shopping list, too. I had a a couple of issues with my account (which were totally my fault!) and their customer service was so nice and quickly fixed my problem!

Title: Yummly is to cooking as Pinterest is to crafting
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app. I can put in all the ingredients I don't eat and suggested recipes come up that don't have those ingredients. I just wish that I could select multiple ingredients that I don't use at one time. For example, I don't use sugar, when I type in sugar a very long list of different sugars appears. Unfortunately I can only pick one sugar at a time. Then I have to repeat the search to select the next type of sugar I don't use and on and on and on. Brown sugar, light brown sugar, caster sugar, maple sugar, cane sugar, dark brown sugar, beet sugar, confectioners sugar, super fine sugar, raw sugar... And you can't just select multiple sugars in one go. So that bit is time consuming, but once that's done the recipes are spot on as to what I am looking for.

Yummly is simply the best app I've ever used for finding literally any recipe you're looking for and it provides for any dietary need you may have whether it's vegan, paleo, low carb, vegetarian, diabetic, whole 30, etc. You'll find thousands upon thousands of great recipes for ethnic foods, too. I've found that I love to make Greek dishes and there's no shortage of delightful Greek recipes for anything that I want to cook. It also gives nutrition information, an option to add items needed to your grocery list, and a whole bunch of other options that are super useful. It makes creating a gourmet meal as easy as making a family friendly, easy weeknight meal. I highly recommend this app to anyone who loves to cook classic favorites as well as new things!

Title: Nearly the only place I go-to
----------------------------------------------------------
The app is fabulous for finding new and easy to follow recipes, which is very important for me as the wielder of the spatula in our home! I really appreciate how you can adjust the servings as needed and it will automatically adjust the recipe to match your needs. It helps save time and let‚Äôs face it... time! No one wants to have to deal with the nuisance of figuring out what the difference in spoon or cup or oz is gonna be if they need to make more or less to fit their families needs... it will just make them want to pass on a recipe altogether in favor of something simpler to avoid the hassle... but Yummly takes the guesswork out for you and let‚Äôs you just keep going with that tasty sounding new recipe you have been really interested in trying!

Title: Easy, Breezy!
----------------------------------------------------------
I HATE TO COOK!!  That said, I HAVE to do it because I have a family.  Since getting the Yummly app never have I been more excited and and willing to get in my kitchen and start stirrin' up the goods.  There is something for every palate on Yummly and as an added bonus, my kids love to go through the various recipes and "yum" the meals, snacks and desserts that are most appealing to them.  That's a huge plus for me because I don't have to guess about what they do or don't like, I can simply look at their selections.  My husband uses it for grilling ideas and useful tips.  So in one app I've gotten over my fear and resentment of cooking and have replaced it with with the joy of togetherness in creating a great, nutritious meal with my family.

Title: Genius cooking
----------------------------------------------------------
For anyone who has ever shopped in a supermarket while hungry, it is the worst - you buy everything you crave, and sometimes have nothing that actually ‚Äúgoes together‚Äù in a healthy fashion.  Yummly is FANTASTIC for breaking the process of cooking/preparing down to: being able to shop in your fridge/freezer/cabinets before you go to the supermarket.  You can get exactly what you need - look at nearby stores that have the ingredients - and basically shop before you even leave your kitchen.  Also, Yummly gives allows you to time all of the preparation and desired eat time that you would like - and all of this can change: to the day/time, which is wonderful.  I enjoy this application immensely - even doing recipes that sound so bizarre.

I have made more meals in a week than I ever have! Meal planning was always so hard for me to do with a little one - never enough time to look up recipes, always forgetting something at the store, etc. but with Yummly, I have been able to get all my groceries in ONE trip to the store, and find the recipes easily! My favorite new find in this app is that you can set a schedule on your calendar that will remind you when you need to start prepping the ingredients & throwing it all together to have it done by the dinner time you‚Äôd want!! THAT is HUGE for me!! I am very bad at planning out the meal prep time, always causing our meals to run into the night, or having to throw some last minute dinner together that is below exceptional.

Title: Great source for wide variety of recipes!
----------------------------------------------------------
My sister and I are fanatics for cooking and absolutely love to find new ideas to try out. Her and I have been using Yummly for probably, 5-7 years? It‚Äôs been a good long while! Some recipes still need a judgement call on them as they need to be edited some for errors - some are exact copies of others - and some are just completely far from a recipe (open can of soup, add water and cook on stove till warm). Then there are the majority that are good recipes and ideas. My sister and I have made countless recipes from this app and will for as long as there is this app probably just simply because it is a fun pass time of ours to just go recipe window licking and just make a weekly or monthly planner of meals from time to time...

Title: Flawless
----------------------------------------------------------
First review I've ever done, and I owed it to the creator of this app. You, my friend, are the real MVP! I clap my hands for your greatness. If there was an award for awesomeness....it would be named after Yummly. Unfortunately, for every other participant, everytime I open this app...you again would win the Yummly Awesomeness Award, Yummly, and leave the others competing for second. This may seem a bit much, but this is an understatement of how great this app is. Sometimes I want to open this app, lay my phone down and throw money at it like a stripper. This app is simply magnificent. If I were famous, I'd have to be the face of its advertisement. Simply put...this app is dope...and at intergalactic potency!!! üòä

Title: The only reason I cook
----------------------------------------------------------
Any time I try a dish that I love, I want to learn to make it myself. Before, I‚Äôd just use google, but it was difficult to keep things organized. Yummly has made it easy for me to search and save recipes that I want to attempt. I‚Äôve attempted a lot and the app lets me add all the ingredients to a shopping list too, which I love. With the added comments on recipes from the Yummly community, it helps me better understand what I‚Äôm in for when attempting a recipe (add more or less of an ingredient, cook longer/less, etc). I could go on and on about it. There are still features that I have yet to utilize. I just think it‚Äôs great and this app has single handedly fanned the flames of my passion for cooking at home.

Title: Finding good foods to eat finally!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am probably the worlds pickiest eater. Because of that I have a hard time finding new foods to eat and I get sick of the same things over and over. I decided to take some chances on internet sights and YUM is the best place I‚Äôve found so far! I love the potato, ham, corn chowder! It‚Äôs so good! And the ground beef minestrone soup and stuffed cabbage, truly yummy!!! I make meals a couple of months in advance and freeze them. It is so nice to just pull the out, heat them in the microwave, add a salad or fruit, or a muffin or some kind of bread ‚Äî try the banana bread with the streusel, it is to die for!! Everything I have made has frozen nicely and tasted just as good after thawed and reheated! Love this site!

Title: Yumly makes cooking a breeze!
----------------------------------------------------------
A few years ago I was in a rut cooking the same recipes week after week.  My two kids would ask, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs for dinner mom?‚Äù If I said chicken, they would reply ‚ÄúNo! Not chicken again!‚Äù With the voice of agony that I never want to hear again! It made me realize how boring and routine my cooking had become.  Not wanting to disappoint again,  I quickly started looking for a solution to our problem.  I found yumly and my kids are now wondering what new and exiting recipe I will make each day!! I can‚Äôt thank yumly enough and I share about it with my friends every time I get a chance!! Thank you! From the bottom of my heart and the bottom of my kids bellies!!! My kids will never be bored with my cooking again!!!

Title: Life Saver!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am at the beginning stages of learning how to cook. All I can say is this app is a life saver! I love the fact that I can search recipes based on nutrition guidelines I apply and also change in regards to what I want to make. I added a category to my Yumms that is "Today's Dish" so I can quickly find the recipe, add items I need to get to the Shopping List, and finally make. The shopping list is crucial for me personally. I'm the kind of person that walks into a grocery store with a few thugs in mind (not written down) and walk out with almost everything except those items. All I can say a negativity is sometimes I wish I could have this app on my Kindle Fire. Absolutely amazing and beautiful app.

Title: Amazing App that Has Really Supported Me Entering a Healthy 30s
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app - not kidding, but it has literally changed my life. I‚Äôve been trying to eat healthier for stomach/digestive reasons I've had my whole life and this app has made that so easy for me. I‚Äôm not a chef by any stretch of the imagination, but it allows me to customize my dietary restrictions and them sends me emails weekly or puts recipes on my feed that fit in those restrictions. They even will tell you what recipes are the fastest and easiest if you‚Äôre not the best cook, like me but getting there(!), or just want a snack. I even started the Whole30 and it suggests recipes that are Whole30 friendly. Without the support of this app, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it. Thanks guys! Good work!

Title: The BEST Cooking App..PERIOD
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried the AllRecipes Dinner app, Tasty, and Evernote‚Äôs Recipe keeper app. NOTHING compares to this app. I love how in-depth the initial questionnaire is, to automatically weed through recipes you won‚Äôt want. The flip side is that it highlights recipes that are awesome and new. So far I‚Äôve tried 3 different dinner recipes that impressed my house of picky eaters! I am from the Southern US and my style of cooking has been soul food. My husband has more creative tastes in food, and I‚Äôve been wanting to experiment with middle eastern and Mediterranean flavors. This app has a wealth of recipes from all different parts of the globe. I rarely review apps, but I had to give this one 2 thumbs up!!

----------------------------------------------------------
Great app! This app is my favorite. It‚Äôs awesome for individuals either looking to follow a particular diet (keto, low sodium, etc.) or just have other parameters or restrictions they need to adhere to. As opposed to vaguely browsing a search engine for something that stands out, this app makes it easy for me to say, ‚ÄúHey! I want chicken with cilantro but I only have 30 minutes or less‚Äù. Furthermore, seeing how many people have liked the recipe and being able to easily adjust the serving size is another plus. And I can‚Äôt forget about the ability to easily save and organize recipes that have interested me. I recommend this app to everyone! There are even drink recipes as well.

----------------------------------------------------------
I am a beginner cook, and before I downloaded this app I literally was cooking the same things every week. I wanted to diversify my cooking, especially since I'm newly married, but I needed it to work with my schedule. I went to the App Store and I ran across Yum ü§ó. Not only do they give you easy step by step directions, but you can also click on the ingredients and know exactly what to shop for. Now I try a different meal at least 2x a week. My first meal didn't come out correctly, but once I kept trying it got better. Had this app for about 3 weeks now and I tell other ppl about it. Great for versatility and beginners like myself. Gave me more confidence in the kitchen!!!!

----------------------------------------------------------
I'm not a great cook, in fact I hate it!  But it is less expensive than going out to eat every night, plus I have a family of four to feed.  I hate the planning part even worse than the cooking part, but Yummly has made that easier for me.  I love getting email notifications with suggestions for meals, it gives me great ideas that are customized for our taste in food.   I love that you don't even have to leave your house for the ingredients.  In my area, we have the ability to shop the grocery list that is automatically generated based on the recipes you choose, and it is delivered right to your door!  It really can't get easier than that! Amazing app in my opinion!

Title: Wonderful, Valuable, Educational
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded this app at the start of COVID as my wife and I challenged ourselves to cook more. This app made it fun and easy to try new recipes and dishes. You can just type in pretty much anything you want into the search bar and have a number of different recipes to choose from. The ‚ÄúYum‚Äù function is awesome and I use it to save recipes and put them in ‚Äòlists‚Äô so I can go back and browse my past likes easily. For example, I have recipe lists for chicken, beef, (any other meats), sauces/marinades, desserts, holiday, etc. I‚Äôve really annoyed using this app (daily!) and recommend it to most everyone I meet that wants to get into cooking more. 5 stars all day.

Title: Nut Allergy here! This is wonderful
----------------------------------------------------------
I have had this on multiple phones. Just Googling recipes is fine for plenty of people, but when you have food allergies or dietary restrictions, it can become stressful. This is also the easiest way to filter by ingredients, the tool I use quite often. I even have recipes saved to try another day, gotta remember to buy some of those key ingredients! This does not eliminate my family resources for their recipes, it just lets me add something new to the rotation or plan for something interesting! About to make Salmon With Everything Bagel Seasoning from A Taste of Joy and Love for the second time this month. Not a paid review, just wanted to recommend it!!!

I had been spending so much of my time clueless about cooking and agonizing about what to feed myself, so frustrated that this dilemma never ends, and then just giving up and ordering takeout, which had such a negative effect on my body and my wallet. And then came Yummly. It is amazing. I'm actually doing a cleanse right now with pretty specific exclusions. Yummly makes it so easy to set your criteria and then find tons of recipes that will fit. I am so grateful. And my hope is that the bank of recipes will just keep expanding. This is genius. Please don't ever take this away!

With this simple and elegant recipe app you'll be sure to get excited to start cooking. With lots of different recipes to choose from, even the ones where you haven't herd of before and ask yourself, what is that? It looks delicious. Photos of recipes look sharp and taken from a professional, log into to your Facebook or Google account to save your favorite recipes by tapping the 'yum' icon, search a recipe that you've been wanting to make for a really long time and make your grocery list of the ingredients you need. All in one app! Yummly, the app you gotta have to walk into the kitchen, cook what your cooking and say "mmmmm! I just have to eat that!".

----------------------------------------------------------
I never leave reviews.... but this is the best cooking app I‚Äôve ever found. I‚Äôve used it for a couple of years and love that it‚Äôs full of food bloggers recipes and linked directly to their websites. I used to just google for recipes, but never found as many quality recipes as I do on Yummly. There‚Äôs a massive variety of recipes in this app and that‚Äôs what makes it priceless. You can set food preferences to make sure that each recipe that pops up is something you‚Äôd actually eat. The grocery list feature is the best. Saves you time and effort and you can add in others items you need. I tell all of my friends about this app and they always love it too.

I love Yummly, in addition to having millions of recipes available from top chefs to cool bloggers, it allows you to filter your search by ingredients that you do or don‚Äôt like as well as by what ingredients you already have at home. Love the shopping list feature, you can creat 1 shopping list for multiple recipes for the 5 course meal  you plan to cook and it automatically sorts the items by grocery store depts (ex diary, meats, etc). Lastly the schedule feature is perfect, pick the day you plan to make receipe and when you want it to be ready and it will give you an alert/reminder on when to start prepping. I use this app more than I expected.

This is a great app with so many selections. Highly recommend. One thing I would like to see added is the ability to mark when you have tried a recipe. I save many recipes to my "yums". I would like to be able to distinguish the ones I have tried from the ones I haven't tried and organize them as such. And maybe give them my own ranking(not something that would be published to others, just something so I could know how my family liked them. Also the ability to add notes would be great. (something like , "added a little more garlic". Or "substituted this ingredient".) It would be great to have the ability to do that. But overall a great app!!

----------------------------------------------------------
I LOVE this app. It‚Äôs always so hard to meal plan especially on a budget and this makes it SO much easier. I‚Äôve been really trying to eat healthier and watch what I eat more and this helps so much. You can find a recipe you like and add stuff to your ‚Äúgrocery list‚Äù. Easy peasy! (Never wrote that out before and it looks weird but I‚Äôm leaving it) so far it hasn‚Äôt asked me to pay for having a meal plan app which is another thing I love and am always concerned about. Being on a budget for my groceries, I don‚Äôt really want to pay to have an easier way to get food in my belly. They show YouTube videos, recipes, tips, and you can add your own too.

I use this app regularly to find new recipes. Its filters are super helpful, you can easily narrow down what you're looking for. Diet restrictions, ingredients on hand, time it takes to cook, methods of cooking, and so much more. It has quite a few options I haven't even tried yet, like pairing a smart thermometer with the app! I use it on a regular basis, and would absolutely recommend this app. The developers recently added a paid subscription option, but the free version is still super useful so they don't force you to pay for the subscription(they didn't throw in a bunch of adds when the premium version came out either!) So thats nice

Yummly has to be my favorite app on my phone. It's probably the one I use the most. As a person who is now gluten free, it is so essential that this app allowed me to set my preferences and needs for my account based on food allergies, etc. All of the recommended recipes for me are gluten free every time I access my app. I don't have to filter the recipes each time I log in, which is extremely convenient. It's also great how I can categorize my recipes that I've "Yummed" by breakfast, lunch, etc. I don't have to search the internet for good recipes anymore. Yummly is my go-to recipe box for sure! Love, love, love it! Oh and it's free! üòÉ

It‚Äôs SO easy to plan and schedule meals! Craving Mexican cuisine? Yummly‚Äôs got you. Starting a keto diet? No problem! There are tons of recipes. I love that the app alerts you when prep needs to start. This helps keep me on track. And the integration with Instacart? Game changer! I seriously had meals planned and groceries delivered to my house within two hours last weekend- all while still spending time with my baby. Thanks for all you do, Yummly!

Being the only vegan in my family is tough, and I have to say this app has made a world of a difference. I'm able to tailor the recipes so that only vegan recipes are shown and I am astonished at all the possibilities available to me through this wonderful app! I would highly recommend this to anyone with dietary needs that still wants a large variety of food options. Another great thing is the nutritional facts shown on every recipe, and the ability to categorize your favorites. Also, the shopping cart feature is incredibly useful, and i can say it has saved me both time and money on my grocery shopping. I use this nearly every day!

My wife and I started keto a few weeks ago, and Yummly has been an extremely helpful resource. It's easy to search for recipes, and I like how I can save recipes in different collections so if I want to make breakfast I can just click on my "Breakfast" collection and check out my options. For a long time I couldn't find the "Yum" Safari button to add recipes that aren't in the app, but I finally got it working so now I can even save recipes I find online. And I love how Yummly includes reviews, so I can see what other users thought about that recipe. This is a well-implemented app and I honestly can't think of anything it's missing.

Then be ready to look all these gorgeous pictures of deliciousness lined up for you to peruse, salivate and eventually try out. If these were not enough, I would simply enter a couple of words in the search box and BAM!... more recipes!  I am new to vegan cooking and the selections here make me wonder why it took me so long to figure out what I've been missing all along. My body is thanking me for the healthier meals. And I thank Yummly.

Other than that, I‚Äôm very excited to continue to use this app to make some delicious meals.

I seriously love this app and use it all the time. It is essentially a collection of every recipe available on the internet in one place, except that unlike just googling it, you can filter by taste, calorie, course, prep time, and you can add recipes to your list and if you hit add to shopping list, it automatically adds ingredients to a shopping list by section. I use it all the time when I'm looking for new recipes and love it's convenience. My only complaint would be that sometimes it's hard to use the recipes while you're cooking, because it is on the iPhone and scrolling with oily or chickeny hands is hard.

----------------------------------------------------------
As a professional cook, I love this app.  It lets me find, compare and plan dishes.   Easy to use, and find some recipes I wouldn‚Äôt have known to search for.  One thing I will say, is the ‚ÄúPRO‚Äù version seems a bit high priced at $5/m($60/year?).  Cooking is a catch 22... either you love food, so cooking is part of you, and you learn along the way.... or you don‚Äôt cook good often... so why pay for an app?   I would probably pay $1.99/mo($24/yr) to watch an educational video occasionally.  Just my $.02.   Like I said, free version is already great.   Paying just seems like a wast to many people.  Thanks YUMMLY!

Title: Deserves to win every app award!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a fantastic app. Once you pick a recipe, you can add the ingredients to a ‚Äúshopping list‚Äù for you to shop or ‚Äúbuy‚Äù and it will send to you Instacart or amazon fresh account to be delivered.  Then on that page you can see the prices each store is charging and the total grocery bill price!  In addition, you can swap out brand, organic, or type (green bell pepper for red or yellow) and you can change the quantity!  I also love how you can set it to your calendar so it‚Äôs easily found when you‚Äôre ready to cook!  Just all around well thought out!  It should win best app award!!!

Title: Love my new YUM App‚ù§Ô∏èüòãüëç
----------------------------------------------------------
This foodie app is just the berries for my heart friendly meal plans. I love the fact that it comes up with recipes according to my food choices. Build your own grocery list too. There are so many great recipe apps at my finger tips but this is the only one so far that I can find recipes that are little-no fat, low-no sodium, a sugar alternative, make my ‚Äúheart happy‚Äù recipes. There‚Äôs a whole world out there of heart friendly meals & I believe I‚Äôve finally found the jackpot of food choices for my meal plans. I definitely would recommend this YUM App. I give it ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è & a üëç!

Title: Best App for organizing recipes
----------------------------------------------------------
I love to cook. I labeled folders based on the meal or type of dish (sides, desserts, breakfast, etc). These are the recipes I‚Äôd like to try. Then I have folders with all the same labels with the words ‚Äútried and true‚Äù. For example sides tried and true, desserts tried and true, breakfast tried and true, etc.  I also added a folder ‚Äúgross‚Äù. I put recipes that we didn‚Äôt enjoy, recipes that were not successful or something that we found a different recipe for the same thing we liked better. Even if it wasn‚Äôt gross, I would put it in there to know we don‚Äôt need to make that again.

Title: Nice App
----------------------------------------------------------
I really do like this app. It's good for looking up, and sharing recipes. You can chose what kinds of foods you do or do not like. The app will show you only the recipes that appeal to you, and your taste. You can also review the recipes to let others know how they turned out. Whether you like them, or not. Also, you can add ingredients from the recipes to a shopping list in the app. It allows you to check off the list. There is also an option to order these ingredients. However, there isn't a grocery delivery service in my area. But it does have the feature for those who do.

Title: The Food App I Use the Most
----------------------------------------------------------
I have a number of food apps and most of them are decent. However, my most beloved one‚Äîhands down!‚Äîis Yummly. Nearly every dish for which I request recipes is instantly provided in multiple versions, from simple to more involved. Many of the recipes have built-in videos to make the preparation process even simpler. Since I love the Instant Pot so much, I often search for recipes specifically for cooking in that device. Yummly focuses on that type of recipe nearly as much as I do, and they never fail to provide me with ingenious and delicious options for that cooking genre.

After cooking the same dishes for the past 23 years I had become bored and many nights resorted to fast food or takeout, in the 10 days since I downloaded this I have tried 4 new recipes and repeated two, my family is thrilled. The recipes are easy to organize, easy to follow, I can easily make simple adaptations if needed and I am having fun cooking again. I love the feature to add the ingredients to a shopping list, I feel happy to be back in my kitchen and having everyone asking "what's that smell?" & "can I have that too" thank you for this app. Happy Mom & Wife.

----------------------------------------------------------
would be enough to make you LOVE this app, but every other aspect is just as wonderful! I am an avid Pinterest user - for everything including recipes, but after having found Yummly, I rarely get any recipes off of Pinterest! Believe this or not, my HUSBAND even loves Yummly, looks at it almost daily and I do ALL of the cooking - of course now I have MANY, MANY suggestions üòú‚ÄºÔ∏èI ‚ÄúTRY‚Äù and introduce my husband to 2-3 apps per month, none of which he is at all interested in, and only maybe uses 2-3 of those apps PER YEAR! So you see....that makes YUMMLY very special!

----------------------------------------------------------
Very good app. I often find myself grazing through the recipes in awe. Everything looks so good. I noticed that in the app, there is an option to ‚Äúbuy groceries‚Äù, and as useful as that is. I believe that, if i were able to take a stockpile list of saved recipes and get a composed grocery list of the items i would need to make each one of those meals (like a weekly meal planner), that would put this app over the top for me. I save many recipes, and its very time consuming to make this list as well as go through each recipe. But overall, very good and very helpful.

----------------------------------------------------------
Ever since using this app meal prep and planning has gotten so much easier. Not only can you find amazing recipes (and trust me there‚Äôs alot) but you can add them to a shopping list with one click and have it all organized for you. I was hesitant to use this app as I figured you would have to pay to make it good but that‚Äôs not the case. Paying only unlocks a few special recipes and features so you don‚Äôt it for the app to work. I‚Äôve tried so many recipe apps but I deleted all of them once I got Yummly. Also organizing recipes becomes so easy with this app as well

Ok, I just got this app a few days ago, and I wish I could rate this more than 5 stars cuz this is so great and so much fun! At first, it was already perfect right when i opened the app, it asked me like what my diets are and what ‚ÄúYummly‚Äù should tell us when they enter like the names like ‚ÄúAlice, we had etc..‚Äù AND RIGHT WHEN I SIGNED IN, LET ME TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT HAD SO MANY RECIPES AND WAS THE BEST. It had the ingredients and ‚Äúadd to cart‚Äù and where you could get it and how to make it. Honestly Yummly, I love you guys. GET THIS APP RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVENT!

I‚Äôve had this app for years and years and love it so much! There are so many recipes, so many search options and ways to cater what you are looking for! I love how your recipes are saved right there and can be organized how you‚Äôd like. The only complaint is when you search the recipes in your Yummly box it can be hard to find the recipe you are looking for...since I have hundreds of recipes saved I hate going through them individually to find the one...time consuming! I feel like it‚Äôs gotten better recently, but I still find myself scrolling more than I‚Äôd like.

----------------------------------------------------------
I needed a directions because I knew in my head or maybe my mouth what I wanted to eat. Yes use Yacon potatoes but peeled and parboiled in salt. I also saut√©ed onions before layering, heavy cream more oz than called for (because that‚Äôs what the store had) and I melted a sharp and white blended cheese (because that‚Äôs what I had) mixed  with a little garlic powder. It was so tasty, I can‚Äôt wait to eat it again for leftovers!!!  And easy... use a good SAFE mandolin, slice, layer potatoes and onions, pour the warm cheese mixture , put it in the oven and your done.

Title: Great for meal planning
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been practicing a style of meal planning for a year now after failing to find an app that meets it. Finally I can across this app and I'm a very happy cook! It allows me to create a queue of meals based on what I selected and bought ingredients for. I can also easily find a recipe whenever I spot a good deal in the supermarket and know what items I still need to get. I like that I can adjust the serving in a snap, which helps while I'm shopping. I find it very easy to use as I'm not tied to a specific database or website. What an awesome app this one is!

I usually don‚Äôt write reviews but I absolutely had to, this app is great. It gives you thousands of recipes for any situation and give you so many options, it gives you a clean interface and gives you the ingredients and the directions to make whatever you want. It gives you all the calories, preparation time, and the amount of ingredients as soon as you click the  item with the amazing photos with them. It gives you all of the nutritional information right below the title. Absolutely love the app and is the only app I would use for recipes. 11/10. Amazing.

Best part is that my teen daughter and younger grade school daughter love these healthier food choices.  They taste so good they don't realize how good it is for them!  I use this app everyday; an absolute must!

----------------------------------------------------------
I have used many recipes that I have found on Yummly with mixed results. They are not all complete and leave out such details and the size of pan or temperature of Oven or length of time in oven.  This week I was looking for a traditional sugar cookie, like we made when I was a little girl many many many years ago.  I had to search through a lot of gluten-free, sugar-free and Ingredients I had never heard of to find anything close to what I wanted.  I am all for healthier diet but if you Yummly is becoming more health and less comfort foods, I‚Äôm finished.

The minute groceries start delivering to ‚Äúmy area‚Äù half of my entire enterprise as an adult human will be complete. This app encourages me to reach for better, lends hope that I can become better.

There‚Äôs even a function that will put a recipe that I‚Äôm planning to make on my calendar and send me alerts as to when to begin prepping it, when to cook it and when to check on it. This app is so personable and easy to use and I recommend it highly to anyone- beginner or expert-who likes to cook.

I love that Yummly gives a preview to the ingredients without having to open another page. I love that you can build a menu by adding recipes to your Yum folder and create sub folders (I keep a weekly menu folder that I can easily move recipients in and out of without deleting them). I love that you can click and add ingredients to create a shopping list and share with others (I forward mine to my husband so he can shop on his way home). It is also great that you can share recipes directly with friends through text or email. Keep up the good work Yummly!

Title: Nice app to find a variety of recipes
----------------------------------------------------------
Love the app. There is one thing about it that I‚Äôm not 100% sold on: some (most) recipes link to an external website. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be a link. Users just have to put in the instructions which they don‚Äôt usually do. It would be nice to not have to go through a webpage within Yummly to get the directions of the recipe because the ingredients are listed on Yummly anyway (for nutrition facts on each recipe which I dig). At that point it‚Äôs not really a problem with the app if the users aren‚Äôt making use of the feature so no star taken off for that.

Since I went vegan, I've really been forced to get my cooking skills on point. This app has been a major asset in that department. I love that I can set my dietary preferences in order to avoid digging through a bunch of recipes I'll never use. I'm only shown vegan recipes. I choose my recipe and put the ingredients that I need on my shopping list. I usually go for simple yet flavorful recipes, but you can go all out of you want; the variety is great. I really have  been cooking a lot more and have grown in confidence in the kitchen. This app is great!

I have had this app for about 1 year. It has so many  recipes that have yums/likes on it showing how good it is. It has recipes for EVERY occasion. Breakfast, snack time, lunch, dinner, dessert, smoothies, and other drinks. In the app all the ingredients are listed, you can change the serving size and the ingredient amount will change to what the serving needs. If you don't have an ingredient you have a shopping list that reminds you what you need for a certain recipe. I haven't  looked on any other cooking website since I got this app! It is a must!

Not only does this app give you recipes and give you suggestions based on what you have already liked, it has the recipes organized from dinner to drinks. It allows you to add the ingredients needed from the recipe of your choice, to a grocery list which is convenient and you can easily check off. You rate the recipe and write your own review and even follow people if you like their recipes. This app is well-organized and convenient, but mostly resourceful since it also suggests some kitchen instruments to help you with the recipe. I recommend 100%!

The Yummly App is the best free food recipe app that I've found. I've downloaded a few others but always used this app. You can basically search the ingredient you have and they give you so many recipes. Plus it give you the calories and ingredients needed for the recipe. It would be cool if there was another tab with what cooking / baking utensils and or equipment you will need. Sometimes that's the deal breaker for me that I may have all the ingredients but not have the equipment in my kitchen. Overall I love this app and I know others would too.

I've been using the Yummly site for approximately two years. It's efficient, allowing the user to search recipes based on ingredients you may have on hand, or by specific types of recipes (i.e., "pound cake," as an example). You can save your favorites, create a recipe box sorted however makes sense to you, and create shopping lists. Best of all, the database is exhaustive. A search for a recipe may pull up recipes from magazines, such as Martha Stewart or Southern Living, as well as from blogs throughout the internet. Well done, folks at Yummly!

I seriously love this app so much and I never write reviews of that tells you anything. First of all it filters depending on food allergies, food you don't like, and what dietary preference you are -vegan, vegetarian, or paleo-, which is wonderful. Second, when signing up it first asks what gender you are, then it asks what you identify as. I got so so happy, I, myself, am not trans* but I'm very close to people who are and it's hard for them when they have to choose between male and female when asked. Oh, and the recipes are very very good! üòã

You can save recipes you like in categories, such as ‚Äúbreakfast‚Äù or ‚Äúdrinks‚Äù, and create your own custom categories! Trust me, you need this app!

Thank you so much for taking the stress out of finding great recipes so I can get back to the fun of cooking! And I love being able to give back by leaving reviews and photos so others can feel confident trying a new recipe.

They ask you questions about what you want first then bring you to the homepage and they find stuff related to what you liked on the homepage like instagram or Pinterest. Then when you search up something like cake they ask you if you want an ingredient left out or time and dietary preferences to limit it to what you might like. Now it isn‚Äôt all perfect ‚Äòcause no app is but I definitely love this app and how organized. They also let you change your dietary preference if you need to. Thank you so much Yummly for this free app to help me out.

I've never used such a convenient recipe app before. Two things that can improve out of the millions of things I love is when getting an item on your grocery list it should know that I need a specific amount of a thing when more than one recipe is calling for it. Instead of having seven "jasmine rice" items to click. The second is instead of taking me to the website and needing to scroll through the bs of a lady talking about her day and how funny it was making it last time I want to just see the directions I don't care for the extra stuff.

I am loving Yummly. I have a teenage son who is very into weightlifting and physical fitness. Fitness is important to me as well. This app has made it very easy for me to find recipes that are different than the usual stuff and I can cater to whatever eating pattern my kid decides he wants to try. To be honest, I am the same way though, I get on kicks where I want to eat a certain way for awhile and Yummly helps tremendously. I LOVE the shopping list feature. I know I am enjoying an app when I start telling all my fitness friends about it!

I really love this app. I am on it daily looking for new recipes to make for my husband. The only thing that is a little disappointing. People do not give reviews of the recipes. I love looking at how they liked the recipe. What did they do to make it better. I wished more people would take the time to review each recipe. I also do not like that you can't print off the recipe. You have to waste your phone or tablet batteries. Also when you get recipes in your email every time you want to save a recipe you have to log in. Drives me batty.

I‚Äôve used Yummly for several years and have often recommended it to friends and family! I love the ease of adding ingredients to my shopping list and then having those items listed by department makes grocery shopping a breeze. If I find or am given a recipe from another source like Pinterest I search for it on Yummly and usually find it, so I can keep all of my recipes in one place. The Home page recommendations are great, the more you Yum, the better the suggestions are to fit your personal tastes and cooking style. Love this app!

I use this app to find vegan recipes to actually cook for myself rather than eating garbage food all of the time, I love that it allows me to filter out recipes that aren't vegan! I use the shopping list when I'm at the grocery store and mark it as bought when I add it to my cart so that I don't have to stop and scroll :') I was, however, wondering if it might at all be possible to add a reminder to throw out fresh produce when it's likely about gone bad! (I suppose I could do this myself as well but again, new to the cooking thing)
