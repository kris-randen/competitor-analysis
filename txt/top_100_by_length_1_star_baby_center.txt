Title: Horrible user experience
----------------------------------------------------------
The app could be great if the developers can fix all the annoying horrible issues that are driving me nuts. It consistently makes me login over and over again. When I first downloaded the app months ago, every single time I clicked in the app it would make me enter both my email and password again and it didn‚Äôt even attempt to auto fill my email. Finally, after having to type in my email and password daily for weeks, it retained the info but I was using it less frequently as a result. After some time with no issue logging in (finally), it just happened again. I couldn‚Äôt remember my password and had to reset it... and the link to reset would not work at first because the cookies appear to have remembered where I left off so I had to go back and close the app in order for the reset to work. Right Before it logged me out for no reason I had a great birthing video up that I wanted to show my husband when he returned from work. The app does not allow you to share or forward videos so my only choice was to wait for my husband to come home to show him this video and then this whole password reset made the placeholder I left disappear and the video lost. I am so frustrated with this experience... the ‚Äú What to Expect‚Äù app is way better as I have never had to reset my password and I am able to easily forward videos on it if I want to. This app has a few cool features but all these issues make it super frustrating to use otherwise.... this was my last straw. I have given this app plenty of chances and I‚Äôm done being frustrated for no reason when this should be a pleasant experience looking at a baby app...

Title: The creators of this tried...
----------------------------------------------------------
The women on this app are brutal and extremely rude and insulting and board owners take part in the harsh words as well (they should be neutral and just oversee things, not actually contribute). Wish it was monitored to create a community of support, instead it seems to function more like Facebook for high schoolers because the women feel the need to attack the others (I don‚Äôt have Facebook for this reason). Lots of close minded individuals on here that don‚Äôt know when to keep their one track mindedness to themselves. Besides from the participants of the site, it‚Äôs structured to be a bit more old school in medical information and advice. Not really giving the most accurate info but I guess its based on generalizing anyway in an attempt to appeal to more moms. If your a non vaxer... good luck to you on here. No info is provided about that aspect, only pro vaccine and if you bring it up, the other moms attack. Not really the most pleasant app but I see the good intent and that‚Äôs why I keep it. Good for tracking how far along you are in your pregnancy (which I guess you can use a calendar for). It‚Äôs a good app, but could most definitely use more work.

Title: Horrible app DO NOT GET!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is not good. Cyber bullying is encouraged on here!!! The actual baby center community guidelines are not followed and the group owners since they are not paid will pick and chose who to support even if another member literally harasses you and attack you. And even when they admit or see violations by these bully‚Äôs they literally do nothing about it. They allow the exact same ones to bully the ladies here and they go back and forth to different month boards bullying others on those too. Nothing is done about it. Their customer service will ignore you and your concerns and only responds with a short reply when you end up having to resend email over and over. Horrible customer service and horrible set up and a horrible place for moms who need support as they end up getting harassed, torn down, belittled, insulted, judged by the bully‚Äôs baby centers support and back up. I will be sharing this info on my social media as well to warn others not to get. I will be using other pregnancy apps to support my pregnancy with fair guidelines and not ones that are made to treat others with discrimination and unfair treatment.

Title: Backlash
----------------------------------------------------------
If there was ever a time when you didn‚Äôt agree with something why wouldn‚Äôt you just walk away from it. If your an adult. This app has condoned several women to attack my inbox on my views constantly for 4 days about abortion. 45 notifications total. I was  clearly reflecting on my past decision NOT TO ABORT MY CHILD. There were a series of malicious words these women had when I only said why are you challenging someone‚Äôs integrity about something and being combative when you could just ignore the ignorance. More women reported my comments and keep inboxing me. I just gotten over horrible morning sickness and was fighting it for 2 weeks. Then I get on this app to have a little closure just seeing my comment that I didn‚Äôt kill my child. Then I get bashed for it. Don‚Äôt to get involved with these app Groups and discussions some people are not willing to take it but they can dish it. Altogether this was a disgrace to women everywhere I wish I would‚Äôve never downloaded it

Title: Don‚Äôt read articles by their ‚Äúexperts‚Äù
----------------------------------------------------------
The app is good for keeping track of where you are in your pregnancy, and has some useful tools like the contraction timer, but the articles are basically useless. Anything on there that has anything to do with nutrition is both laughable and maddening. I don‚Äôt know how many I‚Äôve perused about baby and toddler nutrition that are still pushing you to feed your baby a low fat diet. It‚Äôs no wonder childhood obesity is such a problem in this country. Then they have geniuses like Kate Marple, one of their ‚Äúexperts‚Äù, who also wants you to put your toddler on a low fat diet, but also sneakily tries to convince you they need to be vegetarian as well, while advocating for super high sugar meals consisting of nothing but frozen vegetables and ‚Äúwhole grain pasta‚Äù. The other health related articles are not much better, but these nutrition ones are absolute garbage, and only helping to ensure that half this country remains diabetic and pre-diabetic.

----------------------------------------------------------
I thought this was an app that you can share your experiences on and reach out to other mothers about concerns during and after pregnancy but when I make a post about what‚Äôs going on in my life, the people in charge of the app flag and remove it. That‚Äôs really heartless and inconsiderate and they really don‚Äôt have to worry about me using the app anymore, I will be deleting my profile while also spreading the word about what they‚Äôve done, more than once at that. People were loving my posts until the creators or whoever it is behind the scenes removed them. If the community doesn‚Äôt have a problem with what I said why do they? They just don‚Äôt want to see anyone spreading any positivity, it‚Äôs always the posts that make you scared of pregnancy and giving birth that they leave up but delete the ones trying to help make a difference in someone‚Äôs life.

Title: Group owners BULLY members
----------------------------------------------------------
I was only on this app for an hr before I began getting bullied by 2 forumn owners in the ‚Äútrying to conceive‚Äù group. Zicc and IVFwarrior attacked me and would not stop commenting on my post being extremely rude over me asking a simple question. Luckily many of the group members came in my defense and expressed concern over how I was being treated and answered my question politely. It sounds far fetched but if I had receipts to show I would. Unfortunately right when everyone came to my rescue they deleted the post. I could not believe people in a pregnancy app of all places would treat people like that. Deleting this app and finding a different one. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE TRYING TO CONCEIVE GROUP!! If you do, watch out for ZICC AND IVFWARRIOR. ONLINE BULLIES!

Title: The app is okay but community is a henhouse at best
----------------------------------------------------------
If you‚Äôre looking for a forum for community support from other mothers or moms to be, you are better off asking a random toll booth worker than going to this mother‚Äôs forum site. It‚Äôs full of know-it-all women that have had kids and feel like they‚Äôre the authority on all things mother... with kind and helpful souls peppered in between. It‚Äôs mostly a sounding board for bored petty stay at home mothers that have nothing else better to do (though they could be somewhere offline seeing about their child) and would rather troll boards looking for new moms to harass. It‚Äôs an awful, unregulated by Baby Center Community board leaders and is a chicken coop at bestüôÑ. Save your time. Talk to yourself in the mirror or ask Siri, at least she might be polite. üëéüëéüëé

Title: Used to be the best app before updating
----------------------------------------------------------
I used this app three years ago with my first pregnancy and just downloaded it again for my second. Shortly after entering my data, the app was updated and has a completely different format. Everything fun has been taken away from it- all of the fun polls and informational articles that I would be so excited to read everyday. Now the app has barely any info on it, other than the size of your baby week by week, which you can only check once a week, obviously. The app crashes on me all the time now and has locked me out several times. Such a bummer. This was my favorite app the first time, now I barely check this one and I‚Äôve had to download other apps to get the same sense of excitement and info for this second baby. Please go back to the original!!

Title: Should be no stars for recent update
----------------------------------------------------------
Love the community, have been using it for years as a support lifeline after baby loss. The recent update with font changes and then the Babycenter staff and programmers sticking with this horrible font is sad because I read how people can‚Äôt function while reading because it causes eye strain, migraines and other issues with people with disabilities. I myself don‚Äôt have problems immediately but I can‚Äôt spend as much time as I used to because the words start floating all over the page. People as mass leaving their groups, Group owners can‚Äôt monitor their groups because of the above problems and no one is making any strides in making changes to a different font. Please Babycenter, don‚Äôt erode my online support group!

I would give this star a 5 star but u just can‚Äôt bring myself too it. People can be very very rude and judgmental on this app !!! I have literally deleted this app 2 times because this app does more mental damage from all the mean,hateful and careless people that are on it. They give good tips and good baby updates but just wish they would do something to make it more of a happy and positive app other then a judge mental , arguing 24/7 over some stupid stuff app like literally if you post more then one thing about one topic you will get jumped on by so many woman and it‚Äôs not even fun like literally it causes more stress then anything..... I would love this app if it wasn‚Äôt for all the bullying and judging!!!

Title: Terrible ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù
----------------------------------------------------------
If you are Christian or pro-life (and feel strongly enough about either one to even mention it on here), go elsewhere for information/community or prepare to have your comments deleted or attacked by the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt shove your beliefs down by throat‚Äù women who...well, do nothing but shove their opinions down people‚Äôs throats. It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if moderators weren‚Äôt quick to declare a pro-life comment as a community violation whereas comments encouraging a woman who was considering aborting her baby (because the baby MAY have Down syndrome) that she should think of her other kids and not put that strain on her family is somehow perfectly acceptable on here. Really, it‚Äôs just kind of sickening.

Title: Trash
----------------------------------------------------------
Update completely ruined the app and the tipping point that made me delete it was all the judgement. Some topics I get but something as simple as a name choice they will harass you for. It‚Äôs unbelievable this community is that toxic. I don‚Äôt know how this app is even still running. The rolled out the update to UK first and took no advice on it even though it was horrendous there too. So clearly shows the fact they have no care for their members. The group owners aren‚Äôt held accountable for their actions and will bully you along with other people. Just be careful app isn‚Äôt for sensitive people. Definitely not for conservative people either or anyone who goes against the grain.

Title: The latest update rendered this app unusable
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been a member of the website for over 15 years.  In the past, I accessed it through my web browser because that was more convenient for me.  After the ‚Äúupdate‚Äù, the site would no longer work on my browser, so I had to download this app to continue to have access.  The app is so slow and difficult to navigate, it is no longer worth it to try and use.  It drains my phone battery, so if I‚Äôm not plugged it, I can only use it for about 15-20 minutes.  It is painfully slow and many times takes you to a different link than the one you clicked on. There is no way to bookmark or save your place in threads you are reading, and it starts over from the beginning when you click out.

Title: Pointless
----------------------------------------------------------
This app let me down so bad. I created an account because you can't use it unless you do. So, great I utilized the "bumpies" and began to really like the app. Well my phone gave out and I thought "well I'll lose everything but at least my bumpies and pregnancy memories will be saved in that app" so I logged in on another device and what do you Know, they're all gone. So tell me WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING AN ACCOUNT IF IT DOESNT SAVE ANYTHING. So now here I am 30 weeks with a phone that no longer works and no photos of the past 30 weeks. If Instagram and Facebook have the capability of keeping everything no matter where you log in this app should've too. I'm heartbroken.

Title: Isn‚Äôt this supposed to be about pregnancy?
----------------------------------------------------------
If anyone wants a baby app that is about PREGNANCY and not politics and race, PREGNANCY+ Is the baby app you need!! It‚Äôs sooo much better than this crap!! I liked this app when I first got it. I didn‚Äôt know it was gonna be used as a platform for politics and what‚Äôs going on in the world. I thought it was supposed to be all about pregnancy. I‚Äôm disappointed. Everywhere I look I see news stories and ads about racism and what‚Äôs going on in the world I didn‚Äôt need a baby app to shove all the negativity into my face too. I came on this app to find something positive to look forward to, my baby. My pregnancy. Thanks for being another news platform baby center.

----------------------------------------------------------
I loved this app at first, we took a bumpie starting at 5 weeks so we could document the beautiful change in me. Word of caution!!! If you get a new phone or your iPhone accidentally deletes your apps like they like to do all of your bumpie pictures will be gone!! I lost my whole first trimester of pictures and I am devastated. I emailed customer service and said if you get a new phone or the app is deleted your pics will be gone unless you have backed them up. Please back them up to your camera roll. I can‚Äôt get them back. I don‚Äôt understand why they won‚Äôt stay, even the baby names I saved are there but not the pics. So disappointed that they do this.

Title: GET READY FOR THE BULLYING
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is great for everything BUT the groups. In the groups you will have so many problems. People in the group feel empowered by their anonymity they feel it‚Äôs alright to gas light the crap out of an actual genuine question then continue to make personal attacks over and over and over. If your looking for groups that are helpful there‚Äôs a handful of them. The rest are like reliving high school if you were ‚Äúthe one kid left out‚Äù or bullied to crap. Honestly for first time moms I‚Äôd say use this app for everything else besides the boards and groups if you join a group I pray you get in one that‚Äôs actually helpful and not vile and full of hatred.

The app has decent articles that aren‚Äôt updated enough and sometimes repeat, it‚Äôs awful to navigate, the members are awful, oh and once you make an account YOU CANT DELETE IT. Yeah that‚Äôs right you‚Äôre stuck in their system until the site dies off. There‚Äôs zero support and the groups are just cliques. Came here hoping to find someone to spend this pregnancy excited with and instead it made me feel like crap. Can‚Äôt even get my account taken down, don‚Äôt waste your time.

When it comes to tracking pregnancy and weeks its okay. My tracker is off but it shows me good examples of development. Now the groups are horrible. As others mentioned the cyber bullying is bad. That doesn‚Äôt bother me it‚Äôs after so many responses the close the whole thread no matter if everyone is respectable or not. I posted something and went to sleep and my thread was closed before I could respond. It said closed for evaluation they never reopened it. Once you get too many responses they close it because of all the attention its getting. I like the GLOW better because they do not do this. It is very underrated.

----------------------------------------------------------
This app has several toxic groups and Group Owners who will go out of their way to degrade and bully and tear down other women constantly and it‚Äôs totally allowed to happen. They literally look for ways to put others down and it‚Äôs sick and messed up. If you do still decide to download this app‚Äîsteer clear of the group called: Marriage & Romantic Relationships. Their group owners are the worst offenders. I‚Äôve never seen such terrible things written to other women before ever. And when women spoke up about their mistreatment they were ridiculed and bullied even further. It‚Äôs frankly just sad to see. Steer clear!

----------------------------------------------------------
The app itself was ok during my pregnancy. Ok information provided. Nothing fantastic. I was 10 weeks pregnant when I lost my baby. The other two apps I used offered support for women going through miscarriages. They immediately stopped pregnancy updates and emails. They also offered online support groups. I tried stopping pregnancy updates from baby center but they still came for 3 weeks. I tried to unsubscribe many times. It was so painful to continue to receive updates for weeks after. My husband and I will try again when cleared by my OB and I will not be downloading this app again.

I ended up deleting the app because I was being bullied and attacked just for asking for opinions it‚Äôs crazy how mean grown women can be for no reason I don‚Äôt need that kinda of negativity especially when it‚Äôs supposed to be a happy time. Pretty sure the bullies are either men or women who are jealous of pregnant women because they can‚Äôt get pregnant, they had a whole thread of just making fun of everything everyone posted and they were very immature and yet I called them out on being mean and my comment gets deleted?

Title: Catty Pregnant Women
----------------------------------------------------------
I was part of the groups for one week before deleting the app. I was dumbfounded by the way these women responded to one another! Some ladies are very kind, but you could clearly see the same ‚Äúmean girls‚Äù group being a bully in other posts. Tons of interesting posts ended up deleted because the same people never knew how to disagree on a respectful manner. Their mean behavior was somehow encouraged and viewed as funny by the other women. I mostly observed the conversations, but it was enough for me not wanting to associate myself with this type of nonsense.

Title: Weed out the negativity please
----------------------------------------------------------
I never use this app anymore because when I first became pregnant I was literally ripped to shreds by some hateful women about a post saying I was depressed and not a thing was done. I couldn‚Äôt even remove my post to avoid the hateful comments!!! Please work on this because other than that I do like the app. The negative comments should be read and picked through and the people that post them should be banned. The actions from those people could have led me to suicide at the time I was already in such a depressed place. Thankfully I pulled through

Title: Horrible company
----------------------------------------------------------
Only giving one star bc there‚Äôs no option for ‚Äúzero stars.‚Äù The app is subpar to begin with. Very little information given, nothing most women don‚Äôt already know. To top it off, if you join the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù where all speech should be FREE and encouraged‚Äî If an expectant mother asks for advice and BabyCenter doesn‚Äôt approve of your advice (ie: experimental medical practices) they will remove your comments and disable your entire account. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever given a bad review in my life... this app more than deserved one! Don‚Äôt waste your time.

So I‚Äôm new to all this and I just typed like a really long post about what‚Äôs been going on and needing advice and when I pressed create post it deleted everything! My post isn‚Äôt there and I‚Äôve literally been typing and crying for like an hour. This is supposed to be where we can get support and stuff for what‚Äôs going on this thing just deletes it. I feel bad enough and now I feel like it‚Äôs not even worth posting. I have no real people to care so why would a bunch of strangers online care? Thanks BabyCenter. Way to push someone over the edge.

I joined the app to see what my baby looks like I thought it would be one of those cool 3D apps that I could see better features but it‚Äôs just basic pictures I could get off google. Plus the group chat is FULL OF KARENS ü§®ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. A lot of the ladies on this app already had their babies or lost theirs and still on the chat wanting everyone to feel as bad as their life is going üôÑ. DONT WAIST YOUR TIME with this app. Unless you are seriously bored with your life and like to argue. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PREGNANCY+ better app for expecting mommies üòã

Title: AVOID this app. Go to What to Expect instead.
----------------------------------------------------------
I didn‚Äôt use this app very much except to track my pregnancy and read articles. There was a lot of useful information. The downside in this app are the groups. Some are good but others are filled with rude, belittling, and condescending members. They are quick to judge and put in THEIR two cents. They are not there to be supportive or helpful in any way. I‚Äôve posted the exact same story in this app and WTE and the difference between members of the apps is astounding. If you want helpful and generous feedback, go to What to Expect.

----------------------------------------------------------
I love the info and community on this website. I used it with my first pregnancy seven years ago and was happy to rejoin this time. However, the mobile app is extremely glitchy. I can‚Äôt load posts on the birth board, and when I try to comment or post, the keyboard freezes up and it takes me ten minutes or more to type a short paragraph, and sometimes it crashes before I can even post it. I cannot participate in the community because of the poor quality of the app on iPhone. I am so disappointed because I really enjoyed it before.

Title: harmful nutritional information
----------------------------------------------------------
I was using this app with no issues until I went under the "is it safe"? category to see what foods are safe or not. This app has cows milk given BST under the safe category. COWS MILK. Filtered puss with hormones that doesn't belong in the stomach of humans except baby cows, disgusting. How can an app like this promote such false information. Yet a vegetarian or vegan diet was not put under the safe category? Im sorry I didn't know a plant based diet of mostly vegetables is more harmful than downing animal milk during pregnancy.

Title: Used to love it now not so much
----------------------------------------------------------
During my first pregnancy I really enjoyed the app and the way it was set up. Everyday there was something new to read and you could jump ahead and see the actual date and day. There was also more things to read when you clicked on your body or your baby. Now it just goes by the week, there are so many ads, and what little there is to read is usually covered by ads. Also some of the information in the articles is incorrect. I miss the old app before they updated. I‚Äôll be looking for something else to track my second pregnancy.

----------------------------------------------------------
This app has old threads. If you don‚Äôt read the date and comment the other women jump all over you and are very rude. I watched other women post and get jumped all over. I thought this was a place for pregnant women to go and feel empowered but instead it was the opposite. I had only been on the site 24hours when this happen to me and others. It was very upsetting to experience and watch. I think after awhile this app should have a feature where you can no longer post on older threads. To avoid this kind of bullying behavior.

----------------------------------------------------------
This app is full of moms who bully other moms and the app fails to reprimand them for their nasty attitudes towards others but when someone tries to tell them something then the app acts against those who choose to defend themselves against these nasty women. I reported these women and then I got a warning from the app saying they would DELETE MY ACCOUNT for defending myself against them! I told them to go ahead and delete!  If I could give zero stars I would. I will be using the What To Expect app for my next pregnancies.

----------------------------------------------------------
Don‚Äôt bother posting your questions and especially photos that you seriously need answered. These several expectant moms that are highly rude and judgemental towards others. It‚Äôs like a forum with a group of teens. You can report the rude comments but nothing will be down. As you go on to read other people‚Äôs post you find the same individuals bullying those posters as well. It‚Äôs really ridiculous. Just find somewhere else to post your questions or feeds because it‚Äôs totally not worth it and baby center condones the drama.

----------------------------------------------------------
The app has useful tips and information along your pregnancy, but the community aspect of this site is filled with negative opinionated women. It‚Äôs not a safe space to post even your own opinions or concerns without getting attacked from women who aren‚Äôt kind and don‚Äôt respect other people‚Äôs feelings or ways of doing things. Other apps aren‚Äôt as catty as this one. The purpose is to support each other, not to assert your entitled, self-righteous thoughts as the absolute truth and the only way to take care of your child.

As a new mom I thought there might be a good community of other new moms who would be interested in sharing activities and other things that help advance their baby‚Äôs development. I was wrong and this is not a great place to share productive conversations with other intelligent moms. This is a good community if you want to complain about some of the challenges of being a mom, brag about things like your body after baby, or ask questions that you could‚Äôve just Googled (or call your doc) to get way better advice faster.

I loved this app when I was pregnant, but after my baby came and I was ready to put my bump pictures in a album I looked and all my bump pictures and pregnancy notes were gone! Customer service apologized, but said there was nothing they could do to retrieve them. How horrible to offer this and not protect the data or have it properly stored. If I would have known my pictures wouldn‚Äôt be safe I would have never used this app. Luckily I had some pictures on my phone, but I am missing weeks and all my notes are gone.

I have no idea how to navigate through it now and when I do open it, ads pop up more than anything and I don‚Äôt know how to leave those pages. There is not ‚Äúhome‚Äù page anymore and I kept scrolling and clicking on different items to finally get to what I wanted- the general description of what happens during this week in a baby‚Äôs life. Would not recommend this app anymore.

I put in the gender of my baby and this app still refers to my baby as the opposites. It feels weird reading about your baby as the app refers to her as a him when you‚Äôre having a girl honestly and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. What‚Äôs the point of having the option to add the gender of the baby? Also in the tools option where you add your bump pictures, they don‚Äôt always load properly, I constantly have to go back and update the photos. One time all of my pictures disappeared too and that was frustrating.

App takes forever to open up or freezes when I try to open it. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt open up at all!!!

App features such as weekly highlights, baby size, & your baby, take forever to load when clicked on or they don‚Äôt load up at all and the app freezes. Same thing happens when I click on the tools tab or birth club tab and the notifications tab doesn‚Äôt load at all!

Babycenter is a great resource in general to get information and connect with other moms going through similar things. With that said, the app glitches. It use to be very minimal, however still noticeable and now it leaves the app totally unusable. I have email them multiple times and moms are discussing it on the birth boards. The company seems in no rush to fix the problem. Deleting and redone loading doesn‚Äôt help. Now that people can‚Äôt use the app, the website crashes from the overuse. Very disappointed

I never leave reviews, especially for apps but this has been one of the most frustrating apps I‚Äôve used. I‚Äôm so disappointed in it. It‚Äôs not user friendly at all! The only reason I keep using it is because I started using it to take my bumpies and want to just finish them out looking the same. It logs me out almost every time I try to use it (minor but annoying). The chats are hard to follow along with. I wish I would have stuck with What to Expect from the beginning. Much easier IMO.

Your account also CAN‚ÄôT be deleted. So be careful. I read a lot of women were having this problem and wanted to delete their accounts, but couldn‚Äôt.

I hardly ever want to open a thread to read it because I know I‚Äôm gonna have to start over again at the top of the board when I go back.

If I could give a zero star I would. The women on this app are incredibly cruel, especially the group owners in the January 2021 birth club. Myself and others were bullied out of the group.

Worse than some Facebook mom groups. And the ‚Äúgroup owners‚Äù are the worst ones.

So if there‚Äôs a post you‚Äôve made that‚Äôs filling up with bullies in the comments, there‚Äôs no way to stop seeing it or to delete it. The overall app is fine I guess aside from some glitches with Bumpie, but it is NOT a supportive environment, especially for first time moms.

In the latest update, I like the improvements to scrolling and a few other features, but this thing stops when I‚Äôm in the middle of reading and goes blank, and majority of the time new posts don‚Äôt load even when you hit the ‚Äúload more‚Äù button. I have to completely exit from the app and close it down from my phone then open it up again and then search all the posts again if I want to continue reading where I left off. PLEASE FIX! I used to enjoy this app.

Title: Full of Mommy Shamers!  Stay Away!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app/website is full of very unsupportive, nasty moms. Was looking for advice on a situation with my in laws and basically got shamed for being an unmarried stay at home mom!  Not sure why being married (or not) has anything to do with how we raise our kids?!  The person commenting basically said if I don‚Äôt contribute financially I don‚Äôt have a say in what goes on at my house. Ugh!  Just very nasty- don‚Äôt waste your time unless you want to be upset!!

Title: The Message Boards are Vicious
----------------------------------------------------------
The app itself is fine. Kind of glitchy, but nice to use for some basic info and storing pictures. The message boards and birth clubs are full of the most vicious mom bullies I‚Äôve ever come across. They gang up on you and try to make you feel stupid and scared if you ask a question. Lots of bored, angry ladies using this app, from what I can tell. If you use it, STAY OFF THE MESSAGE BOARDS. Seriously. They do not harbor a positive environment whatsoever.

Title: Crashes
----------------------------------------------------------
Really liked this app until it started crashing on the 3D view of the baby. Frustrated me so much because it does it every single time now. I refuse to use this app until you fix it, it‚Äôs annoying af. Get it together developers, you have one job to do and that‚Äôs get the dam app to work or else you‚Äôre a failure. And I‚Äôm not the only one mad about it in the reviews, there are several more here so apparently the developers just don‚Äôt give a sht. Way to go.

Title: Good content, horrible log in experience
----------------------------------------------------------
There is a lot of good content in this app, but you have to constantly re-log in to it. Literally every day if you reopen the app, you have to re-enter your email address and password. It is infuriating. Other apps have figured this out. I don‚Äôt understand why they haven‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been like this for months with no improvement. I‚Äôve tried emailing them about the issue and they say they are aware of it but they don‚Äôt seem to be doing anything to fix it.

Title: Paid ads
----------------------------------------------------------
The signet (Zales and Kay‚Äôs) and lightbox ads and placements are obnoxious. I wouldn‚Äôt buy from these companies simply because they are disrupting the app experience and are intentionally blocking use. I can‚Äôt type a comment without one of these ads blocking the comment box and redirecting me to their site. I hope their click through rate goes through the roof with this tactic all just to annoy a potential customers and have no conversion from it.

Title: Should be called Bully Center
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve never experienced cyber bullying until I joined Baby Center, which I now call Bully Center. The women on the forums are incredibly mean and attack other users constantly. Even worse, you don‚Äôt have control over your posts. So if you post something and get hundreds of hateful comments, you can‚Äôt even delete the post to stop the harassment! Stay far away from this app!! There are many other apps that have nicer members and better information.

Title: Trash update that they won‚Äôt change
----------------------------------------------------------
They updated the app and it‚Äôs the worst update, unanimously agreed upon by all of the users. But they don‚Äôt care about that, they care about cramming their app with as many ads as possible so that it constantly lags and randomly refreshes while you are in the middle of reading a post or trying to comment. I hate this app so much and I was once a long time user who loved it. Do better babycenter and listen to your users. This update is awful.

----------------------------------------------------------
For some reason it does not want to stay locked in so that all I have to do is push the app to see my progress. when I go to put my password in it rejects it. then I try to reset it and it takes me back to the login screen and won‚Äôt let me reset my password. I can‚Äôt get a number or email address so I can contact the app developer so that I can get into my app because it goes right back to the login screen.  I really liked this app until now.

----------------------------------------------------------
The app, honestly, runs fine. However this is my 3rd attempt at giving BabyCenter a chance. Every time I‚Äôve left it. The community is horrible, awful and full of hate and cyber bullying. I am honestly baffled as how it has continued to be this way for at least the last 6 years. My heart breaks for the first time mom who looks for support on BabyCenter because she‚Äôll be met with nothing but cruel and hurtful comments. Done for good with this.

----------------------------------------------------------
I thought this app was good during pregnancy but when I had my baby and switched over into the baby mode, I went back to view all of the weekly bump pictures I had taken and 80% of them were gone. I can never get those back. They save a copy automatically to your phone but I didn‚Äôt keep them thinking they were safe in the app but they were not. Use another app for weekly bump pictures. I am devastated as I can never get those images back..

BabyCenter sold my information to third party companies. I experienced a very horrible miscarriage at 13 weeks and guess what? Because of BabyCenter I was emailed right before the due date ‚Äúcongratulations on your approaching due date‚Äù from a company affiliated with BabyCenter. Talk about emotional trauma. I even put into the app that I had a miscarriage. They also spam the crap out of you. I will be using another app this time around.

Very disappointed. I wanted to delete the information from my baby. I had made a mistake imputing some information and they wouldn‚Äôt let me edit it. So deleting the profile was the only option. Well in doing that it deleted everything from my pregnancy as well. All my bumpies. All gone. Which I am very upset about. My husband and I have fertility issues so this very well could have been my only pregnancy and the app deleted it all.

Extremely disappointed in lack of a safe place.

----------------------------------------------------------
I liked this app until I received the article,‚Äù5 things doctors wish you‚Äôd do for your baby,‚Äù and one of them being, get the flu shot. This isn‚Äôt sound advice. Immunizations have never been tested on pregnant women. They are just presumed safe. So, when your doctor pushes for a vaccine, do your own research and remember, the companies that say they are ‚Äúsafe‚Äù are the same companies that are making and pushing the immunizations.

Title: App kills battery
----------------------------------------------------------
I have a brand new iPhone 12 Pro and this app is always the number one battery user in my phone. I‚Äôm only one hour and 22 minutes it used 31% of my battery. This is more than double what FaceTime uses which is a legitimately heavy usage app. This app is either doing a lot of super shady stuff or the developers are really bad at what they do. Please fix this ASAP. This is very unacceptable, bad for users and bad for the world.

Title: Send terrible emails
----------------------------------------------------------
This app allows members to argue, name-call, bully, and ‚Äúshare their opinions‚Äù in the rudest ways. Also, they send emails using fear tactics to scare you into doing what they think is best for your baby. I‚Äôve gotten emails that my baby will get measles, asthma, and allergies. They then gave me biased advice on how to protect my baby from these things- but yeah I wouldn‚Äôt say they researched much before giving their opinion.

Someone should monitor the groups, because the ladies are horrible! I‚Äôll be uninstalling this app, the support group is trash and so are most of the ladies

The part of this app about my babies development is great! The drama on the birth club part caused me to delete it. The ladies on there, to a large extent, are self-righteous, judgmental, down right mean, jerks! I rarely posted but I read responses to posts and there was very little support or kindness to people asking questions. Seriously, can not say enough about how disappointing the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù aspect of the app was.

After I did an update, I now cannot even access the app. I click on the icon on my phone and it looks like it will pull up the app and then it just disappears.

You have many unhappy people with lost photos bc of these recent updates!!

I loved the updates about baby, but the birth boards are horrible. There is so much bullying going on, I‚Äôve even seen group owners join in on it. You report the behavior, but nothing happens. They do nothing. I am deleting this app because of it. Still no option to block a thread, or delete a thread, and no option to delete your own account! You have to email them and request for your account to be closed! Ridiculous.

...and the information is extremely useful. If I were rating for that alone...it would easily be 4 stars. But the ‚Äúbirth clubs‚Äù drag it down to a 1 Star (should be 0). There are quite a few VERY friendly women that you will meet who do actually care and want to offer their advice and experiences if you ask for it. I met quite a few who lived locally and we all even got together for lunches (and still do, to this day).

Title: Bully culture
----------------------------------------------------------
The chat groups on this app can be very helpful, but they have allowed a culture of bullies and meanness. If someone calls out a bully they get overloaded with mean comments or comments that often times include "Welcome to BabyCenter" which highlight that this type of interaction is tolerated here. During pregnancy, women are often more sensitive and need support, and this app is not the place to go for that.

Some of the most negative keyboard warriors I‚Äôve ever seen! Group owners chime in on the bullying and will straight up lie about others being rude and tell you you‚Äôre wrong. If you suggest being supportive you're labeled as a snowflake coddler. Maybe if things were moderated better, but will be deactivating and believe you will lose other users as well that are just trying to find a supportive community.

This is a great resource brought down by a poor user experience. I encourage the developers to find a solution akin to the functionality of the traditional ‚Äúback button.‚Äù  Just about everywhere I go, like in the birth club, I have to close out of a post rather than go back to the previous screen, which brings me back to the very first post in the section. Are there plans to fix this once and for all?

I signed up for this app and loved it! HOWEVER, just after a week of use, it logged me out, forcing me to re-login.

----------------------------------------------------------
I did like this app, until I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks. I had notifications turned on, and I went in the app to report the loss and turn off the tracking. However, IT STILL SENT ME UPDATES FOR HOW FAR I WOULD HAVE BEEN. This makes me so angry. Their notifications did not stop for updates after I cleared the due date. This is so inconsiderate! Probably am never gonna use again because of this.
