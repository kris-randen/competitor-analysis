Title: Caution Pro version is not complete app
----------------------------------------------------------
My father has type 2, so I'm looking for an app that will let  him monitor his food, medications, and insulin and send the reports to his physician.   I thought I found it in MyNetDiary,  The app allows input of these areas of concern supplemented by a food item dbf to get your exact foods eaten. The dbf is not complete it, but to be fair that is a huge task. They do allow for manual input and even scanning the labels to send in for I assume a more complete dbf.  My objection and larger concern is the summery of the data which is what one really want to send to their doctor. The Pro app at a high $9.95 gives you the impression of a full featured app with reports available. However once you discover their website and find out they want to sell the reports for a monthly service fee only accessible through their website in what they term the maximum  version/service  you realize the scam. I am appalled that these people would take advantage of people with diabetes in this manner. Because of their sneaky business practices I do not recommend  this app.

Title: Overpriced, not useful for GD
----------------------------------------------------------
I had high hopes for this app but was very disappointed.  I expected much more for $10.  The database is very difficult to search and the UPC database is extremely limited.  The app tries to set plan guidelines strictly by weight which aren't useful when pregnant, and if you adjust to meet doctor recommendations you are continually told that you need to review your plan.  The chart for tracking past bs counts is just horrid.  You can't compare day to day- it looks like a tangled mess.  It's extremely difficult to compare meals and bs levels to narrow down foods that cause spikes.  And there is no way to create or send a doctor report- not even anything you can screenshot- unless you want to upgrade to their maximum.  Yes, AFTER spending the $10.

Title: Not really what I wanted
----------------------------------------------------------
My diabetes app was obsolete, and thus seemed the best.  Problem:  once purchased, it forces me to enter all foods I eat, and count calories.  I don't need them to do that.  I did it for 30 years as I got fatter.  I count carbs to lose weight.  Counting calories and writing down all foods I eat is what drove me crazy, and I could not lose weight that way.  It made me hate dieting.  Thin people don't do that.  I prefer just entering the carbs I eat as I have it.  Quick and easy.  I

Title: Can’t use for child!
----------------------------------------------------------
After purchasing and trying to input my 5 year old daughters weight of 39lbs during initial setup, it would not allow a weight lighter than 50lbs. My daughter was recently diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and I thought this program might be a real help, but finding that not to be the case. Nowhere in the description of the app does it list minimum requirements for use with this app, such as weight. This has turned out to be a real waste of money. Not a very happy customer!

Title: Can't stand it
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried a lot of different apps for my diabetes and carb control and thought this app was the right one. Wrong. It is not at all user friendly. Entering in the food is a pain and difficult.  Scanner does not work even after paying usd 10. Shame on you. Layout is not good and after using the fantastic app "lose it" for carb control, all I can say is this was a waste of money. I don't use it as free apps are better.

Title: Can't enter blood glucose readings!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I bought this app with the expectation that I could monitor my blood glucose levels, but although there are charts for blood glucose readings. How in the hell does one enter their blood glucose levels? The main page allows one to enter exercise, meals, steps, water intake, and you can even monitor custom setting. BUT NOT BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS.

----------------------------------------------------------
They don’t check ones that customers send in?  I found several things with the same brand and portion with different values. NOT GOOD for a diabetic.  Also they have soooo many (write ins) now you can’t even find the basic stuff anymore. Food check; Scan one, then scan another whole different food style comes.   Reverse to order then the that 2nd one is wrong.  Guess I have to find a new app.

Title: Not worth it. (My opinion)
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought this app about 5 years ago for $10. Over time they added a premium feature which I am not interested in. Today I got on my phone to check the carbs in some fruit when it now is a monthly subscription only. This WAS the best app I could find for carb counting and diabetes management all in one place. But I don’t want to pay for something Google and a piece of paper can do.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hello, sorry about the troubles. We did add a few new premium features, but none of the existing features has been removed.  In particular, checking carbs is, of course, included into the diabetes app.  If you run into problems, please send us an email to support@mynetdiary.com

Title: Disappointed with Charts
----------------------------------------------------------
I upgraded to the Pro version, thinking I'd get some decent charting for my blood sugar levels and a way to email a report. If it's there, I'm not seeing it. I checked out their website and it doesn't seem to offer any diabetic reporting. Pointless to enter all the data if it can't be used to produce a high-low-average sugar chart to help me see trends and adjust my medications.

I am paying $9.68 a month for maximum subscription but it will not let me connect my Fitbit saying I need to subscribe to maximum program.  I am not going to continue to pay for the maximum and not get the advertized benefits.  I have sent several complaints but have received no response.  If not resolved by the end of this week will unsubscribe and go with a different program.

Hello, we apologize for the problems and for the delay responding to the complaint.  We hope that our support team has resolved all payment issues. Please send us a support request from the app if you run into any issues.

This app makes it sound great & anything that interferes with it is somebody else’s fault. I have a problem & cannot find any link to support. I guess the only way to find help is if you cough up $58+ first. It was a great app for a couple of years. Now that Apple has initiated iOS 13, it is there fault. All I want is true Support” app. Then, we can talk money afterwards.

Developer Response:

Title: price not as advertised
----------------------------------------------------------
On 04.11.2020 they advertised a 63% savings.   The statement is next to their annual fee for premium service, normally $59.99.  The ad is misleading you into thinking it is 63% off the annual fee so it should then be $22.20 for an annual membership.    It does not say a a 63% saving as compared to  12 monthly fees.

$9.99 for this app and you cant make it sych with Fitbit?  Yes, this app does synch with Fitbit, but you have to sign up for a Maximim Membership, which is $60.00 per year.  If people are paying $9.99 for this app, surely, build this feature into your app without making people pay $60 a year.  That is nuts.
