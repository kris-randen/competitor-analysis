Title: Great Until Baby is 1 Year Old‚Äîupdate!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is awesome for expectant parents and post preggo parents up to a year old. The advice is sage and well researched, and the app has been my go-to for most things. My one complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt follow you after your baby turns 1. Why is that? I still receive all the same helpful emails about my now 15 month, 3 week old‚Äôs development and timeline, and when I click on an article in the email it takes me to that article-in the app. Where are the weekly updates in the app itself after a year? Where do I find all the valuable stuff in the email on the app? Right now the app is just stuck on the last week of my 11 month, week 4‚Äôs development (again, he‚Äôs really 15 months), with no way to search the app for other advice and articles appropriate to his age. Those highlights are still an important resource even after a kid turns one, folks. It‚Äôs not like parents suddenly need less advice at that one year mark. ;) When I try to go into the settings to see if I can change anything on my end (like if there‚Äôs a toggle I need to switch saying my baby is now over a year old), the app just crashes. If you ever do add an option where there are weekly articles and suggested reads after a year, could you also please add a function where the app can follow two kids? My husband and I have been talking about baby 2, and it would be great to get advice, reminders and articles about BOTH kids: baby 1 alongside updates about what my pregnancy/new baby should be doing, and what I should be up to. For now, I‚Äôll for sure be resetting the app with baby 2‚Äôs due date once the time comes to keep up with all the good pregnancy advice again.

Title: Babygirl December 2020
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using the what to expect App. The first 5months of my 3rd pregnancy and it‚Äôs also been a good App. But I found this one when it popped up in my emails and I LOVE it!! It‚Äôs very detailed and very informational, it‚Äôs more detailed then the WTE App and it has all kinds of good videos to watch about all kinds of things you will go through during pregnancy, I have to say I like it better than the other one and it goes day by day with my baby‚Äôs growth, not week by week only, it‚Äôs much more detailed and has way more information on it for all of us expecting moms to read and I like to watch the videos and see all the pictures so that‚Äôs a very good thing about it too! It‚Äôs a definite MUST HAVE!! I would recommend this App to any expecting moms, new moms or women trying to get pregnant, it will teach you a lot and it‚Äôs a great way to watch your baby grow and get a sense of what she looks like at this time in your belly, I use this App. Everyday or every other day, there is always something to me reading or watching and it never gets old to me! Thank you for making this App.!!! I love it and recommend to anyone expecting!üíñ Good Luck to all the new mommy‚Äôs out there!!

Title: Growth Guide
----------------------------------------------------------
Since I was pregnant until now, nearly five years ago, and two kids later. I‚Äôve been using this app. The amount of knowledge I‚Äôve gained is so valuable to me, I always share it with my husband and friends. Its made me a more confident in rearing my children and finding what works for us best. I don‚Äôt freak out about much in their development either, because I know what‚Äôs coming. Most of the time my mommy-gut feeling about a growth spurt is on point! However, knowing what behaviors accompany those developmental milestones helps you evaluate what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and feel at ease. Baby Center has helped me understand what my kids are going through and how to help them get through the transition. And most importantly- why I shouldn‚Äôt get so frustrated with them, as its not so easy on the LOs or us. I‚Äôve used this app religiously since they were born, and will continue to for as long as you provide info on their age. I look forward to your emails in my inbox and I try not to skip any, otherwise I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on a gem about my own child. Love you Baby Center, keep up the good work!!!

Title: GREAT APP (1st time pregnant)
----------------------------------------------------------
We are first time pregnant/parents! I really thought this app was great! The milestones that I would personally hit during my pregnancy were pretty spot on according to the week by week notifications! I found it very cute and exciting to be able to see her growth compared to vegetables and fruit during our pregnancy! We had a lot of fun with it! Our daughter was born 2 days after her due date, so we were able to see where we were at each week on this app! I‚Äôm not a huge book person, so this was a much easier way to stay in tune to what already happened or what we could expect to happen! Sometimes we were like, oh that already happened last week or two weeks ago! Other times we would be excited and what was going to happen soon! I thought it was also very helpful because it gave us an idea on what to expect and gave ideas of what to ask the OBGYN doctors and nurses! I have been using it even since she was born and we are going on five months old now! Very helpful app!!! We will definitely use this app for our next pregnancy!

Title: Perfect pregnancy app
----------------------------------------------------------
I absolutely love this app!! This app includes a detailed insight of your pregnancy week by week as well as a picture of what your child looks like in your womb. Also, it includes dos and don‚Äôts, milestones during your pregnancy and for your child, and information on any topic that may pertain to your pregnancy, lifestyle, and even your child. I was a first time mother who had just delivered her first child in April 2021 so this app was beyond insightful on everything that I needed to know so and there is even multiple group chat threads that you can ask another mother out there a  or you may just have information that you think other mothers should know without there being any judgement. Even after I had my child, every week I was informed about milestones and information that my child may be experiencing. This app literally has everything that I needed to know so it was the only app I used during my pregnancy, which I was glad about it, and even after I had my baby I continue to use it.

Title: Free & better than other apps
----------------------------------------------------------
Free App, better than the others that charge. I downloaded 5 pregnancy apps and of all of them this one was my favorite AND free. I put it on the home screen while the rest I‚Äôve been checking to see if there‚Äôs anything different and you‚Äôre not missing out on important info by paying for the other ones. I think the information on this app is more positive and correct. I notice other apps like ‚ÄúWhat To Expect‚Äù especially is behind on the latest data and feeds the inner victim/negative expectations around pregnancy that I feel is a marketing tool more than a helpful thing. Things I knew before being pregnant like nail polish is hormone/reproductive disruptive, What To Expect was WAY off on the safety of that and other things and clearly didn‚Äôt do their research when the ingredients are right there for their ‚Äúexperts‚Äù. So I dropped them and went with this app which was the most accurate, positive, informative, and easy to use/navigate. Doesn‚Äôt pop up with annoying ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù prompts either!

Title: I never leave reviews
----------------------------------------------------------
dude i love this app. i love learning week by week what our little one is up to in there. this is my first child so i really utilize all the tools, articles, tidbits, and fun facts to be more aware of the little person im growing. i get so excited reading what vegetable or fruit our baby is likened to during that week in terms of size. ive made it a weekly treat for me to wait until the day of each new week to look at the baby's stats and it helps keep me motivated and informed and excited about what to expect! easy to navigate, countless publications from experts and moms, and fun to use. today im 37 weeks (im not crying, you are) and looking back from when i first downloaded BabyCenter, i really appreciate this app. it's actually gotten me through some tough times throughout my pregnancy by reminding me what a blessing and triumph and miracle it is to become and to be a mom. super duper grateful :,) go moms! we're superheroes and dont let anyone make you feel differently!

Title: Excellent source of information
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has been a Godsend for me throughout my pregnancy and during the first part of my baby's life. There is so much information and articles for just about any question I have. I am thankful for resources like this one and wonder how people functioned without them! I appreciate how positive and encouraging the articles are. Particularly the ones about problems. For example, my baby had jaundice when he was born. Reading the article about jaundice on this app was extremely informative and also encouraging. My hospital experience regarding jaundice was not so calm, so having something to read to tell me everything would be ok was very helpful. I also love the polls. It's interesting to see what others are experiencing that use this app. My only piece of criticism is that I wish that the app did not repeat articles so much. Some of the same articles I read during my first trimester popped back up in the third trimester. This is just a minor annoyance though!

Title: Absolutely Recommend
----------------------------------------------------------
This app saved my life.  I was 30 weeks pregnant and I read an article about things to look for and call your doctor.  Mainly about things that may be dangers during pregnancy and call doctors immediately. Well the article talked about swelling and preeclampsia, etc. I had noticed some swelling before and planned to talk with my dr on the next visit.  I was at work and my hands started swelling like the Nutty Professor. Called the Doc, they told me to come in, sent me for some blood work and the next day I was admitted to the hospital.  The article was right I had developed preeclampsia.   I had my baby 2 months early and that was emotionally exhausting but we are both doing well!   I love this app because it is informative and helps get parents ready for baby, explain what you may be going through and helps with questions you may have about your body.  It even prepares you to understand what the dr is talking about.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP!

Title: This is THE one!
----------------------------------------------------------
It was hard to decide which pregnancy and baby app to go with. Baby Center has clearly been the right choice. It has taken me successfully through pregnancy and early parenthood, so far. The articles and information are always right on time, according to what I‚Äôm experiencing and wondering about, each week. I love knowing exactly what was going on with my baby and body throughout pregnancy. And now, the benefit of knowing what to expect and easing concerns about my baby from day 1, has been immeasurable. Knowing what skills to expect to emerge each week has really allowed me to support and foster my baby‚Äôs development in a powerful way. Even the chat room for my birth month club has been so very helpful as we explore and vent and share experiences and are reminded that we‚Äôre not alone. If you‚Äôre looking for a phenomenal, all-inclusive app for pregnancy and parenthood, look no further. This is it!!!

Title: one of the best baby-parent apps out there
----------------------------------------------------------
I got so encouraged with what I had grasped through this app with my first ever parenting experience that I‚Äôm now planning to develop something similar for Azerbaijani mothers (that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm from) in a native language so first time moms and pregnant women know how to take care of themselves both for the sake of their own and their to-be-born babies‚Äô health. sometimes hearing the stories of women who didn‚Äôt know they needed to be putting more effort to calcium or high in fiber food intake and are now struggling either with bone weakness or hemorrhoids - is making me appreciate what people at baby center  (and text for baby organization which sends couple of text messages with important info throughout pregnancy) do! thank you all so very much for helping all of us stay knowledgeable, healthy and happy and contribute to giving birth to and raising a successful baby with sound health!

Title: What to Expect from Baby Center
----------------------------------------------------------
When I became pregnant I immediately visited the App Store, eager to plug in my estimate due date.  I downloaded three applications: Baby Center, What to Expect and Sprout.  Baby Center was by far my favorite and eventually the only one I used mainly because the search feature was the easiest to use.  The articles feature up to date information based on the latest science based research.  You can also dabble on the more opinion based side and connect with moms around the world.  What to Expect also had these features but I found it difficult to search for information and Baby Center has better SEO so I was often redirected to the app when searching outside of the app using Google and other search engines.  Sprout has a cool graphic of a 3D baby and a nice journal feature (except it will delete your journal in error!) but not worth paying for and it lacked the community.

Title: FTM
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this app. The week by week information is really helpful and I like the fruit comparisons. One of my favorite features are the ‚Äútools‚Äù. That helped me with my birth plan, and kick counts, plus who doesn‚Äôt like to look back and watch their tummies grow?! It‚Äôs also really nice that it transitions over to after the baby is born. I think a lot of FTM‚Äôs have a lot of questions. At least I do! I have a suggestion. I have quite a few apps for pregnancy but not one of them has the option for a preemie. I had to be induced at 34w so my son is 6w premature. All of these apps including this one just gives newborn information. It would be helpful to have the option to see how things progress for preemies. I understand everyone‚Äôs situation is different but a general idea or at least links for articles would be nice. Also, can you add more stickers for the photos?

Title: The ONLY APP you need for pregnancy & baby!
----------------------------------------------------------
JUST DOWNLOAD THIS APP NOW!! I absolutely LOVE BabyCenter!! I use it daily and it honestly brings me so much assurance & sanity during these hectic months of being a new mom. I initially downloaded it to learn about the different stages of pregnancy I was going through. It‚Äôs extremely informative and helpful. I enjoyed taking and creating weekly baby bump pictures through their baby bump tracker. Now that my baby is here, and I‚Äôm a first time mom, I‚Äôve found the community of women on this app INCREDIBLE!! I LOVE having a ‚Äòbirth group‚Äô of women who had children the same month I did so we can ask each other questions about anything (I didn‚Äôt realize his vital this was until having my son!). The amount of expert content and articles is great as well. It‚Äôs a well rounded app and really all that you need to stay informed and have support! Thanks BabyCenter!

Title: Very informative
----------------------------------------------------------
I like this app and the weekly alert I get on the progress of my baby‚Äôs growth. The tools in this app are awesome, the Name Finder is my favorite. I haven‚Äôt had to use it yet, but I‚Äôm sure the Kick Tracker will come in handy later. I love that you can save your baby names that you love and see them all together without going to a separate file. The many different lists of name categories and their rankings are also handy to me. It‚Äôs where I found my girl name (and I love that it‚Äôs very unpopular). But I should say, while the name is ranked with a popularity number, when compared to the US social security website, the rank number is quite different. I‚Äôm assuming Babycenter is ranking based on Babycenter User‚Äôs name choices, and not the actual US population. If the popularity of a name is important to you, I‚Äôd check the SS website for truer numbers.

Title: Single new mom with no parents to guide me
----------------------------------------------------------
This is exactly what I‚Äôve needed my whole pregnancy, labor, training etc. I was scared at first when I found out because I don‚Äôt have any parents to teach me to parent and I haven‚Äôt had much of a good influence. I basically just learned what not to do my whole life. But this app really changed that. my son is already 8 months old and he‚Äôs a perfect baby all thanks to this app. Everyone around me says he‚Äôs the happiest baby they‚Äôve seen... Also thanks to this app.... my pregnancy wasn‚Äôt all that scary... Everytime I felt horrible or different I‚Äôd look it up and it‚Äôd tell me it‚Äôs heartburn which means my baby has hair now or some crazy cool fact that made it less terrifying to change in a way like this. It‚Äôs much harder to google things based off of feeling especially when there‚Äôs a handbook for each day right here. Thank you for all your help.

Title: Right on time advice and guidance
----------------------------------------------------------
From the time my first daughter was born, as a FTM, by myself most of the time, babycenter was faithful and always delivered the greatest insight week after week. what made it all the more helpful was that it truly seemed like was literally right on time‚Äî The very thing I would be dealing with would correlate with what baby centers development email would be talking about for that week. From topics like their health, general developmental abilities (fine motor skills, milestones, temper any, things to possibly expect, appetite ideas, how to prepare for potty training, you name it. And although now that I have 3+ kids, I‚Äôm not able to read the daily mail weekly, I still look back to them for insight form time to time, because they‚Äôve proven themselves true, and foundational for moms who need all the ‚Äúsolid‚Äùinformation and help they can get.

Title: Love this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
When I became pregnant, I downloaded this app because it was highly ranked. I remember going through the app as an African American and seeing a lack of representation for blacks. I sent what was probably a harsh email, complaining  about how this makes for a less than desirable experience for me to use the app. I‚Äôm happy to say that they responded in the way most companies do not these days. They put me, their client first. They responded extremely professionally and said they would put effort towards updating their stock images to help show more diversity. Since they I have seen a variety of moms and dads from all backgrounds and I love it. It is now an app that is representative of what America looks like. Truly thankful for this app because it has helped me enjoy seeing my baby girl grow. Keep up the great work!!!

Title: A great resource
----------------------------------------------------------
Before our baby was born my wife and I were feeling pretty overwhelmed with the shear number of baby books and what seemed like a daunting amount of information we needed to learn, however, after finding Baby Center and getting their week by week updates, it really helped condense things so we could understand what was happening each week without getting too far ahead of ourselves. At each stage of our pregnancy and our baby‚Äôs development we have felt informed and confident and have started really looking forward to reading about what‚Äôs going on each week so that we can adjust our parenting accordingly. Additionally, the parents forum is a great resource any time we have any questions or concerns, especially since it is broken up so we can read posts from parents with babies the same age as ours.

I love baby center! I used this all throughout my first pregnancy and now I‚Äôm pregnant again and I‚Äôm so excited! The website is very informative and keeps you up to date with the progression of your pregnancy. I love the daily updates of where my baby is growth wise. The groups are great and I enjoy the community. You can join a birth group for your due date and talk with other women who are due the same month as you! It‚Äôs awesome to have when you need to talk to other women going through the same situation. There‚Äôs a ton of other groups to join and there‚Äôs so many different options on this website and app! You can even take pictures of your bump and the babycenter app has a section for you to keep track of your bump growth along with cute little stickers you can add to your photos!

Title: Ladies...YOU WILL NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE. Trust me!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is AMAZING ladies. I got this app when I found out I was pregnant at 6 weeks. It gives you so much information and also has group descussions. This part is important: Every week it tells you about different things and changes in your body and when I say they are spot on... Its so spot on that its scary. One day it would say that your gums may bleed a little more while brushing in the week your in. The day I read this... I went to brush my teeth and they bled for the first time! It was crazy. It made me feel so much better and at ease, being a first time mother. Pregnancy can be very weird and scary and this app will help you so much! After your baby is born, it is also spot on. Tells you all about your baby, feeding, diapering, changes, ect. Just give this app a try!

Title: Tips Through Pregnancy and Beyond
----------------------------------------------------------
I love the BabyCenter community! As a first time mom, I was so nervous about my pregnancy and then about raising a newborn baby. I had so many questions! But all of the updates from BabyCenter walked me through my pregnancy, plus I was grouped in a community of expecting moms with the same month Due Date, and I found a lot of support and guidance especially from other experienced moms. I really liked this community a lot better than the What To Expect app. Now that my baby is almost 5 months, I continue to get support and guidance, tips and tricks and milestones from the community! The only negative thing I can say is that some of the ladies on the forums can be a little mean sometimes, but it‚Äôs kind of expected when you put a bunch of hormonal or pregnant women in one room üòÇ

----------------------------------------------------------
When I was pregnant with my 1st Child I didn‚Äôt know what to expect and I had so many questions so to help me get a better understanding about the journey I was about to face I went to my App Store and searched for an app to track my pregnancy journey and I am so glad it did! Once I downloaded this app I truly fell in love with it! Not only was I able to track my pregnancy and see how much my baby was growing from beginning to end but this app had so many answers to my questions. Also I love the fact that I was able to take pictures of my pregnant belly from 9 weeks pregnant up to 41 weeks pregnant. The transformation is truly amazing if I must say so myself! I totally recommend this app for first time moms and any expecting moms! Trust me you‚Äôll be glad you did!

Helps with learning where your little baby is at while they‚Äôre inside you, what‚Äôs developing, how big they are, helpful pregnancy symptoms tips so you know what you‚Äôre feeling is normal and remedies that may help. Then it helps you learn how tour new baby is doing developmentally, showing certain milestones to expect and helpful tips on things to help with colic and gas, and helping new parents know things will get better. They also have groups for parents to support one another, tracking systems to keep track of baby‚Äôs growth. Lullabies that will sing to your baby in those early morning hours when you‚Äôre tired and can just manage to rock them to sleep. There‚Äôs definitely something for everyone!

It‚Äôs quite an informative app. There are many different resources such as videos explaining labor, week by week tips and preparation for what to expect during pregnancy, and much more. There‚Äôs an overall sense of guidance and motherhood connection that you can find in this app. With COVID, I had to hold off on labor preparation classes and couldn‚Äôt join a ‚Äúmom group,‚Äù and it was a lonely experience in that sense. I‚Äôm glad I was able to connect to other moms through this app. i think it‚Äôs so important to connect to other people that you can relate to. There‚Äôs an option to join a group depending on your estimated due date and you can post questions or concerns, or just start a post to get a conversation going with other moms. I recommend this app :)

----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app since I learned I was pregnant. The readings that  it provides are very helpful to me as a FTM. The groups depending due date are very supportive and also provide insight towards symptoms and doubts any FTM would have. The interaction with other moms is a great network and easy way to meet other women that are going or have been through what I am feeling currently.. I love that it shows me how the baby is growing and the different changes we are both going through during pregnancy. it is so educational and allows me to connect with other moms to be and learned abo their current and previous pregnancy experience which helps ease my anxiety as a first time mom! I loved it so much that I recommended to my sister !

Title: Best Pregnancy App
----------------------------------------------------------
This is my first child. So I downloaded about 10 pregnancy apps just to get a feel for which one had the best/most accurate information. I absolutely love Baby Center! There are so many videos and articles that really help throughout the entire pregnancy. My favorite part is the Bump Gallery. You can‚Äôt take a photo of your bump every week and upload it into the gallery to see them all together. I recommend this app compared to the others I have tried. However, I do use one more (Ovia Pregnancy) and that‚Äôs because they let you track your moods, weight, doctors appointments, and many more things that Baby Center doesn‚Äôt offer. However, if you just want the knowledge about your pregnancy then Baby Center is for sure the one to go with!!

Title: One stop shop for useful pregnancy information
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app!! I‚Äôve literally been using it everyday (sometimes multiple times a day) ever since I found out I was pregnant! It was recommended to me by my sister and I would highly recommend it to others. The information is relevant, timely, and very easy to understand. The articles and videos really help me understand what‚Äôs going on in my body, what to expect each week, and what I should and should not be doing to have a healthy pregnancy. I find the tips from real moms and experts to be most useful...it makes me feel like I‚Äôm part of a community and that I‚Äôm not alone in this journey. This is my first child so I was very overwhelmed and anxious but with the help of the app, I am more at ease and feel comfortable.

Title: Disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
I really loved this app and I think it gives some really great information. However I give it one start because when I logged out and logged back on, it completely deleted ALL of my Bumpies. I started taking them at 7 weeks and now being 24 weeks they‚Äôre all gone. It seriously broke my heart because now I have nothing.. not even one. I don‚Äôt get the purpose of making an account if the pictures will get deleted once you log off. I also tried contacting them through email and twitter and have received no type of reply. It‚Äôs honestly very frustrating and I‚Äôm so angry because I didn‚Äôt think to save them on my phone since I did have them on the app. I just wanted to warn other mommies to beware!!! Because this is really sad!

Title: Very comprehensive App
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded the app in November 2019 when I found out I was pregnant. I was 5 weeks along at the time. I love how each week of pregnancy they explain to you what is going on with both you and baby - or babies in our case - we‚Äôre pregnant with twins. They also provide perfectly timed articles and to do‚Äôs for things you should be getting done during each trimester and tips/advice for things you may be experiencing. The only thing I would like to see added to the app is the ability to view and track a twin (or more multiples) pregnancy. They do have information on twins but not on a weekly basis. Otherwise, it‚Äôs very informational, well organized and I‚Äôve enjoyed checking in weekly to track my pregnancy.

Title: Love the content
----------------------------------------------------------
The content of the app was very helpful throughout my pregnancy and is proving to still be helpful now that I‚Äôve given birth. The only negatives I would say are the structure of the discussion section and the polls. The discussion section is full of so many ads that scrolling through a conversation is a little annoying. I prefer the discussion section on the ‚ÄúWhat to Expect‚Äù app. While the polls are very helpful and a nice feature, I find that the majority of the time, the app freezes when I try to answer a poll and I have to restart it only to find that sometimes my answer was recorded, other times it wasn‚Äôt. Other than that a great resource for expectant and new moms. Would highly recommend.

Title: Best Baby app ever
----------------------------------------------------------
Being a first time mom I needed something that was quick and easy to use. The information provided was real, legit, and easy to understand. The groups you can join also provide great members that can answer any questions you have. Some members however can be a little not so great but its easy to block and report, so no hassle there. The tools within the app are so handy. For example, when keeping track of your pregnancy the app has all kinds of stickers that allow you to share/ show the growth of your little bundle. After your baby is born the app then helps keep track of your baby's age and and still provides developmental milestones as the child grows. It truly is the best baby app ever.

----------------------------------------------------------
I really enjoy this app especially when I was pregnant. The community boards were a great place to talk to other moms especially about concerns and insecurities, it‚Äôs nice to know you‚Äôre not alone. And it‚Äôs been great post pregnancy too it has some great articles and a great search a fine for first time moms. I have the what to expect when expecting book and I‚Äôve definitely done more reading on this app than in that book. And it‚Äôs nice for picture tracking too unfortunately my phone broke 3/4 through my pregnancy and my photos didn‚Äôt back up on my icloud and I lost all of my bump pictures but it also has a feature to take monthly pictures of your baby as they grow which I really like.

Title: This app saved my life.
----------------------------------------------------------
I used this app during my first pregnancy. About 10 days from my due date I was feeling weird. But I thought I was just being a wuss and kept on going. In the checkout line at Walmart, I was waiting and browsing the app. I read about the symptoms of preeclampsia and started making the connection. I called the on call nurse who told me to go to labor and delivery and have my blood pressure checked. It was so high they padded the bedrails in case I had a siezure. They induced, and I had a healthy baby boy. It took about two weeks for my blood pressure to get back to normal, but I can't imagine what would have happened if I hadn't had the information from this app. Thank you Baby Center!

Title: Absolutely love this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
By far this app has more helpful articles than any other baby/parenting app I‚Äôve tried. I love that the articles are short and to the point, and each one is has their source cited. I can literally search any subject and there‚Äôs videos, testimonies, charts and medical studies right at my fingertips. I rely so much on this app for those articles as well as the interactive features like the calendar! It‚Äôs my electronic baby book. I also love the growth chart tracker that I can fill it at each pediatrician appointment. I absolutely recommend this app to any new family, or those expecting their little love! I can always rely on this app for have the answers I‚Äôm looking for in one place.

Title: 4 pregnancies all with this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I love the updates! They remind me of symptoms that are normal and things to make sure I‚Äôm doing to get ready. Some people may think this is only for that first baby but I feel like the reminders have been just as helpful in the following pregnancies. I will have 4 kids under the age of 5 come September so the more helpful tips and reminders the better haha. The mom group is awesome! They keep updating you as your child grows and those mom groups that were expecting at the same time as you are now raising kids the same age as yours and struggling through potty training with you which has been awesome. I highly recommend this app it‚Äôs been so great, I can‚Äôt say enough good things.

Title: Before and after
----------------------------------------------------------
I found this app 10 years ago when I first got pregnant with our oldest. I loved reading about our baby all thru my pregnancy. Lots of helpful information. Then 8.5 years later I used it again for our second baby. This time I showed and taught my first born all about babies. She loved watching the videos over and over. She would ask every week, what fruit or vegetable her baby sister was (it was a never ending joke to her, saying I was having a leek or a squash etc). She went to Dr appointments with me knowing exactly what was going on and what to expect and now that ‚Äòher baby‚Äô is one, they are the best of friends. This app helped start a beautiful relationship between my girls.

Title: Great education and go to for baby!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app. When I was expecting it was great to read how my baby was growing and excellent information on the growth of my baby in the womb and all kinds of info on for me as an expecting mother. When my baby was here it flipped to a tracker for his growth! I loved that and I love to read age milestone expectations, how other moms are handling parent life through the articles and so many go tos for feeding, what to expect coming up and all of the concerns when things don't seem normal. Even the ads aren't bad at all. Well done Baby Center! I have recommended this app to so many parents - expecting first time and second and third baby and they love it. You will too.

----------------------------------------------------------
Thank goodness for technology! I know being a first time mom I am probably a bit over board in the worry department and the wonder department  I just wonder what all is going on with baby as well as myself minute to minute, and I must say this app is so informative and helpful. I have noticed too that everything mentioned always Checks out as fact ( which I like ) definitely take the time to download this app besides it being a learning tool it also helps build the platform for you and your spouse to bond with baby together by keeping up with new developments each week and of course it helps us new mothers & those veteran mommy's bond  with our oh so precious baby!

I've used this app through two pregnancies as well as post birth. It has the answers to motofmy questions before I have a chance to ask them. It gives me insight to what I should expect as normal. The app has changed a lot in the past 5 years and now offers tools for feeding, sleep, a growth tracker, as well as a sort of mile stone picture album so you have everything in one spot! I love it. If you are still pregnant I also highly recommend Growth Tracker, it's for more detailed info that hospitals will beg you to track. Also the app Full Term, is really really great for tracking contractions. These three apps keep me feeling much more comfortable about momming!

From day 1 of the pregnancy countdown to day 1 of motherhood this app is there for you. Ive learned so many exciting things during my pregnancy. I've tried other apps but this one has always been the best. Every week you get videos and tips for your new little one. Theres a mom center where everyone gathers and shares advice or answers questions you have, you can ask literally anything because someone else is going through or has gone through something similar. It's great to have the support and advice from res doctors, plus it‚Äôs full of tons of ideas. Absolutely love how much this has helped me with my first baby, I‚Äôll use this as long as it‚Äôs available to me

This app literally helped SO MUCH!! It helped me realize I was definitely on labor with the contraction tracker with BOTH of my kids! AND has helped me with everything from breastfeeding tips, knowing that‚Äôs it‚Äôs ok that it didn‚Äôt work for me long term but short term was ok too. Helped me get my kids on a schedule (feeding and napping), helped remind me when they can start eating solids remind me to take their monthly pics (bc I know lots of tired mommas forget ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è everyday runs together lol) helped me with my picky eaters. Helped me with my PPD.  EVEN helped me put the spark back in my relationship The articles go on and on! Definitely the best download!

----------------------------------------------------------
When trying to get pregnant for two years, I used many apps, but this one was the most accurate on the dates.  It was also a great resource to refer back to with the million appointments asking when the last missed period and other dates were.  It was also great to refer back to, to see what the symptoms should be during each week. It has so much information and other mothers to help to solve the worries that may come up. Now my baby is 3 months, and it tells me the baby milestones now.  It is so nice to read what I can expect! I definitely would recommend this app to anyone that would just like the extra info and sources to help when trying to conceive.

BabyCenter was recommended to me when I was pregnant with my first. I asked my OB‚Äôs office which app I could trust, they said BabyCenter and I haven‚Äôt turned back since. This website and other mothers who use it have been my go to for information for my children and myself for both of my pregnancies and one miscarriage. I continue to use it and feel it‚Äôs very important to keep up with developmental stages for my almost 3 year old and 4 month old. I was paying for access to work out videos until I realized BabyCenter offered a wonderful series of videos for the post partum body. I would highly recommend this app and am not sure how others get by without.

My sister used this app for her pregnancy and now I am currently using it for mine! We were able to see the size of the baby click on the pictures with the little ‚Äú+‚Äù symbol and learn so much about what‚Äôs going on inside during the pregnancy. It also gives us amazing articles to read that are full of information and tips to help you throughout your pregnancy. Articles on how what start planning for, what are the right things to eat and what aren‚Äôt. This app literally has so much information that it makes you feel really good about knowing what is happening inside of you and what to expect throughout your pregnancy! I LOVE IT. 10/10 recommend to others!

----------------------------------------------------------
I just downloaded the app yesterday. I appreciate the various features, especially the Birth Class tool! It was informative of the  choices that we can make with our care. I like the Birth Preference feature, you just check off options and it makes a pdf to give to your doctor. I also like the baby size tracker. It‚Äôs exciting to hear about my baby‚Äôs development.  I found that the baby names feature seems a little strange, there were some strange names listed and some were the opposite gender names. I haven‚Äôt gotten to explore all the features yet, but they seem useful. Overall, I think it‚Äôs a great app for being totally free! So I give it 5 stars.

Title: Accurate
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has helped me go through my pregnancy and the 1st year of my child. At the beginning I was amazed how accurate all the info is here- the growth of each body part, the symptoms, the advices and videos are all great. Then my son was born and again the information about his development stages and advices kept everything in tact for me. In all honesty, I followed my motherly instincts more than any advice but I had the piece of mind that I can get the information from a trusted site. At times motherhood could seem overwhelming but this app shares other moms‚Äô experiences, which shows you that you are not alone and helps you keep your sanity.

Title: Great app for tracking pregnancy and early childhood
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is great for tracking pregnancy, labor and delivery, as well as early childhood. The only thing I didn't like is comparing a fetal size to esoteric vegetables I couldn't relate to- wish they would use more common household items. Otherwise, the tips and suggestions were right on cue. The contraction timer was absolutely fabulous, and we used it extensively during labor. It included a ‚Äútime from last contraction‚Äù, so we could anticipate the next one. Knowing the length of contraction allowed us to anticipate the peak and resolution of each one- a godsend. Now we're expiring the early childhood component of it. So far, so good.

So this app is AMAZING! My wife and I are on child number two and I have used this app for both children. The accuracy of the app is out of this world literally when it said we should expect to feel flutters and kicking we did, when it said my wife‚Äôs nausea and morning sickness should start to subside or dissipate it did. So since my wife is experiencing the pregnancy first hand the app helps me feel more involved and gives me great advice and ideas to ease my wife‚Äôs pregnancy... So on a a scale of 1-10 where 10 would be the highest score my wife and I give the BabyCenter app a 10! Thanks for all the great advice along this journey.

Not only do you get videos and pictures of what‚Äôs happening in your pregnancy weekly, but you get multiple articles for each day of your pregnancy!

Plus, there‚Äôs all sorts of tools to monitor your baby‚Äôs kicks, make a list of names, remind you of doctors appointments, make your birth plan, and more! Not to mention the social aspect you gain by joining groups of other moms in the same birth month. This app in particular also has a facet for trying to conceive, which can be so helpful for those struggling. Everything is great!

----------------------------------------------------------
Babycenter is very informative. It provides weekly status updates of your pregnancy from conception to the third trimesters. Also, from newborn to 10 years old. I always look forward to the weekly topics for your baby/child developments. Also, it has tips/advices from other parents to help new parents i.e. what you really need for the baby during the first year, Q&A, how to take care of yourself, how to make time for you and your partner. Plus the additional tools available to track your pregnancy pictures, capture baby moments, growth, weight etc. Thus, this is by far the best baby guideline a new parent can ever ask for.

You‚Äôll get info on your body and the changes as the weeks go by. There‚Äôs tons of helpful articles & chat circles you can talk to other pregnant women in! I‚Äôll keep this app until my beautiful baby arrives ü•∞

I did my research before downloading a baby app. I'm on my 3rd child and I still found useful info in this app that helped me gain a better understanding of my baby before and after birth. The amount of knowledge that is at your finger tips just within this app is amazing. They really did their research. Everything I was feeling or questioning would pop up as a post right when it should. It was like a mind reader. Really helped me be more confident during my pregnancy. So glad I got this app. My sister had another top rated app and I convinced her to try BabyCenter. She loves this app way more. DOWNLOAD NOW! No regrets.

After finding out I was pregnant I downloaded a bunch of baby apps to see which would help the most.  This app has exceeded my expectations!  It had articles and discussions on topics that would be helpful to me depending on how pregnant I was.  And then our LO came and it has been a big help guiding us as to what to expect, suggestions on things to do.  It's great.  Best part is it's free.  Only downside is sometimes there are helpful video tips but they won't play.  Or I'm trying to watch while breastfeeding but there aren't any captions so I can't watch it to after.  But by then I've forgotten about it.

Being a first time mom you have tons of questions! I downloaded 4 different apps to make sure I could soak in as much information as I could and after realizing I only/ always referred to this one I just deleted the others! They have everything on this app from breathing exercises, keeping track of how far along you are, days until birth, sex questions, baby size comparisons, polls (I like this feature so I can see how common my answers are to other mothers. It just makes your state feel more relatable). I seriously could stay on this app all day, there‚Äôs so much to learn. This app is truly a baby center!

My husband loves it because he learns cool tips for himself and can read along and get to know more with me. They have sections for me, for him, and if you‚Äôre having TWINS.

But this app is super helpful to track pregnancies and learn about them each week as your body and baby grows and also after baby is born, tracks and has helpful articles about your first year with your baby. I would recommend this app to anyone. I have used it since 2014, and have not had any major bugs or issues with this app.

As a first time mom, I think this app is very informative and helps you with almost everything from keeping track of your baby to giving you the space to ask question openly to other parents who are either new or experienced mothers as well. I also like how you can get access to so much in one place rather then looking all over the internet when you have late night curiosity or just a wondering mind and you don‚Äôt have a doctor on stand by to ask questions to. This app has helped me a lot and calmed my nerves more then once...which is a big plus since you don‚Äôt want to be stressing when pregnant.

Title: Greats tips!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a great tool especially for new moms who want to do things different from what they were taught. It teaches the different ways of discipline, and learning. It also tells you the different things to expect as your child gets older. I‚Äôm more prepared for my child's actions before she does them. It takes the load off of wondering whats next when you can already know. The experience of being a parent is fun when you have the baby center giving you updates every month. I say download it and keep it for every kid you have especially if all their zodiac signs aren‚Äôt the same. Happy Parenting!!

Title: Amazing and Informational App
----------------------------------------------------------
Love how they show you a related size each week of your baby‚Äôs growth and breaks down what to expect in that week for their development. Equally love the different articles and videos they give each day and related ones as you read and have questions. It‚Äôs very helpful, comforting, and you don‚Äôt feel alone or lost especially for a first time mother to be. Me and my partner love it and both have the app so we stay updated and educated together when ever we personally feel to look. Equally I love the updates they give you of your babies development after birth it‚Äôs so interesting and insightful!

Title: Love this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I loved tracking my babies development with this app. I was so excited when I found out about my little one I wanted to see right away where he was in his development. I immediately went online to find a pregnancy tracker and after downloading two previous apps, eventually settled on this one because the user interface was so intuitive, and I loved how detailed the development descriptions were. Over the course of my pregnancy I found the other features of the app to be so helpful too including: the Bumpie Photo Album, the ‚Äúis it safe‚Äù dictionary, the kick tracker, and the contraction timer.

Title: Amazing App for FTM!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm a FTM and this app has helped me with so many things. The daily reads has taught me so many things that I didn‚Äôt know! The BabyCenter has helped me with any questions I had and answers from other parents! The baby tracker also helped me keep track on how big my baby is and what is expected of him! This app is amazing, I love it! The only downside for it is sometimes it glitches and won‚Äôt let me go back to the previous page and I would have to scroll all the way back or turn the pages.. Overall, this app is amazing and I‚Äôll continue to use it until my baby is able to talk to me properly!

Title: Great place for information
----------------------------------------------------------
While I was pregnant with my daughter and after having her when I had a question it seemed that one of the top websites for answers was this app. There is a lot of useful information here for questions and just things that I didn‚Äôt know. It was fun using it while I was pregnant to see how the baby was growing. I encourage people to use the apps inside the app like the growth tracker and the bump gallery. It was nice to see how my daughter was measuring up once we started taking her to her wellness visits. I have recommended this app to other pregnant women I know and they have all liked it.

----------------------------------------------------------
I found this app during my 8th month of pregnancy, I was looking for a contraction timer and it gave me this. When I logged into the app I found a whole world of information about baby. I plugged in due date and every week this app gives me tips of what to expect about my pregnancy and after giving birth. I get weekly reports on what to expect from my baby and suggestions too. It tells you vaccination schedule for the child, it has a component to where you form a question the baby center community and you can get feedback in real time from.  This app is amazing and I‚Äôm in love to this day.

My daughter is currently 3yrs old (going on 31) and I STILL use this app! Granted you get ‚Äúkicked off‚Äù the app once your child turns 1, BUT, that is Not where the knowledge and articles stop. I find myself constantly referring to this app/site whenever I have a question about my little one and Good or Bad there is an article about it! You have yourself a bitter? There‚Äôs an article about that, retrograding potty training, there‚Äôs an article on that, little one getting Sassy?? THERES A FREAKING ARTICLE ON IT! Not to add it helped me so much throughout my pregnancy. Best Baby App Hands down.

I get excited when I get to a new week and any question I have or anything I want to vent about to other people experiencing the same things, this app helped me get free offers and samples from different sites I never knew about, this app got me a free car seat AND breast pump through my insurance! I absolutely love baby center, the kick tracker is awesome, the contraction timer is amazing to have, and it even has a place to take selfies with you and your bump :)

It has help me as a first time mom really understand the changes that my body, and mind are going threw when they are going threw it! Amazing 3D footage of the fetus at multiple stages of the pregnancy along with the best information and advise filled every day of the week! Weekly photos called Bumpies which can be edited with available options or by you. This can be turned into a slide show later. The list only continues with everything they have to offer.

----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been really enjoying this app-I recommended it to every pregnant woman I know. One thing that I don‚Äôt like is that it asks me to log in each time I go on the app. I really wish there was an option to ‚Äúremember me‚Äù and not have to put in my login info each time I go on the app. I tried to search in the settings, but couldn‚Äôt find the option. I would really appreciate if you fixed this little inconvenience. Update: It seems like it was fixed:) now I am able to use the Face ID to log in.

Baby center helps me get through the long periods of pregnancy when I just can‚Äôt wait to meet my baby and feel like it‚Äôs taking forever! The updates remind me to pause and reflect upon each little milestone. They also give accurate developmental information at all stages of life (as far as I have seen). As a person with a master‚Äôs degree in early childhood education, it is exciting to see relevant and important milestone information shared through this app for parents who may not already know the significance of each step or how to help facilitate their child‚Äôs healthy development.

My husband (and first partner) and I love this app. It has been extremely helpful, giving us great information and even peace of mind when needed. Tracking my progress as I go along and providing detailed descriptions and visual effects of my baby as he/she is growing week by week. We love this app and would happily use again in any future pregnancies. The access and connection with other mothers proves helpful and eases my worries. I was able to find helpful links for the registries and sign up for various amenities like blood cord registry and free breast pump through insurance!

My boss actually recommended babycenter because she used it with her second child and loved it and I‚Äôm so glad she told me about it. I love that anything you might have a question about whether it‚Äôs food you‚Äôre able to eat or skin care products you should stay away from it lets you know every single thing you can or cannot use while you‚Äôre pregnant and also it‚Äôs great that you can track the baby‚Äôs development week by week.  This is my first baby and this app definitely made me feel more comfortable about being pregnant. I‚Äôll definitely be using BabyCenter for my second pregnancy.

The app is fantastic. I used this for my first pregnancy and it was great. If you‚Äôre scouting out apps, this one is user friendly and you can stop your hunt. The community and questions that other moms have made me feel part of a ‚Äúmom tribe‚Äù and included; I was not going through it alone. I asked questions and received supportive answers (specifically struggled with hemorrhoids, pelvic dysfunction, even info on a pillow cover for my preggy pillow and got fantastic recommendations, guidance and responses) The weekly updates (baby/mama) are spot on and something to look forward to.

The fact that they add you to a mommy group that is filled with moms that are due the same month as you, and can ask any question to other moms across the world and get multiple opinions if you need it, just need to rant, or talk about anything baby related and get answers from all types of moms is great! I love the growth updates and all the images it gives you to understand the week you are in. This is 100% my favorite app! (:

----------------------------------------------------------
This app has been updating me ever since the middle of my pregnancy. My baby is now 10 months old and I feel like every week I know a little bit better how to challenge her and I learn a little bit more about what she might be going through. It‚Äôs nice to eliminate the guessing game when it comes to why she might be fussy, or what activities I should be doing with her. I also learned a lot about different milestones, And a lot of my questions were answered about feeding and solids before I even had to ask anyone. This app is a must for anyone who‚Äôs pregnant, and raising a baby!

This app was really useful during my pregnancy. It was very easy to use and understand, the articles were helpful and informative, and I liked that it had polls that you could participate in so you knew if other moms were going through the same thing. The articles and the polls were really reassuring especially since this is my first baby and I wasn't quite sure what was normal and what I should be worried about. I also liked how it told you how the baby is growing AND how your life is changing every week. All in all I loved this app! Definitely great for first time moms!

I love this app for a lot of reasons. As a healthcare professional I have been trained in child development but what I like about this is how it cues you week by week with some developmental guidelines as well as play that reinforces this development. It also provides great articles from reputable resources on a variety of topics from sleep to teaching/exposing your child to the good habit of brushing their teeth. It‚Äôs a nice tool and resource that helps and without being so long winded that you get lost in the articles etc. Speaking of long winded... :) just get the app!

It‚Äôs been tracking the development of my baby since I conceived. It let me know what to expect during my pregnancy as it progressed and it tracked the progress of my babies growth in the womb as well. It answered questions about my daughter‚Äôs development before I even asked them. It kept up with her age and told me what I should expect as each month passed even after I already had her. She is now 7 months old and I couldn‚Äôt imagine not having this app. I wake up to a monthly development report on what to expect from my baby according to her current age. Nothing but love.

This app contains all the information that I need. I relied on it several times for information. It helped me to track my pregnancy, how far a long I was, what I was possibly going through, get ready for what was coming ahead. Even after pregnancy, there is a sequence to this app. What to expect for the first year appointments (what you‚Äôll be ask at the appointment, vaccines baby will be needing), what to do when baby is not feeling well and possible reasons, how to prepare your baby‚Äôs bag supplies, how to burp your baby, how to nurse, etc., etc., etc., it goes on.

As a FTM I am super excited to be pregnant and having this app has made it feel a lot more real for me. I really like that everyday you see 4 or 5 articles or facts about your baby so you know exactly what's happening in every stage of your pregnancy. I also loved the Birth Club part of the app, I joined and was able to talk to lots of great people whose due date was the same month as mine. It's nice to have people that can relate to whatever you're going through and to answer all of the questions you have. Would definitely recommend this app to any expecting mom!!

It‚Äôs like a new learning experience and this app has yet again helped me find solutions and keep track of my growing baby! Will definitely use in the future again and again with my future babies.

I think it‚Äôs the best app out there.

Not to mention this app helped me order a FREE breast-pump through my insurance and it was painlessly easy! You can take pictures of your baby bump and add facts about your baby from that week, review polls on popular subjects during pregnancy (ie: how many people circumcise their son, etc). It is simply great! Highly recommend!!

Before choosing an app to use I read through many reviews like a typical first time mom. This app provided me with information beyond what I was expecting from videos, to pictures, to several articles and answers from doctors. It also has little fun surveys from other moms you can answer as well as a section to take pictures of your baby bump. :-) At 22 weeks this app has answered many questions for me and has been accurate in just about everything I have read. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to monitor their pregnancy process.

Love this app, I have used it with each of my pregnancies/children and am using it now on my fourth pregnancy. It is easy to follow and keep track of the weeks going by. It even helps me remember to schedule things as I go, especially with multiple kids sometimes things fall through the cracks so a reminder is nice to have! Also reminders of what‚Äôs ok and what‚Äôs not during pregnancy is great too. I love sending screenshots of the little updates to my husband occasionally. Solid app, I wouldn‚Äôt use anything else for pregnancy tracking that is for sure.
