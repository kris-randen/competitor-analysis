Title: Awesome app!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app offers so much, including making it your own, adapting their resources on your own style and needs. It is so diverse, includes different levels on intensity and types of exercises. ( HIIT, running, stretching, yoga, cardio, dance) It includes articles on every aspect that affect and impact our eating patterns and weight management, such as anxiety, sleeping patterns, habits on eating more unhealthy foods, self esteem, etc. Most of all it takes care of each one in a holistically way, including: mind, body and spirit to fulfill your wellbeing in a healthier way. Facilitating on reframing reframing those ‚Äústuck‚Äù beliefs we can have in our minds and how they continuously have a domino effect on our actions and emotions making us to go to unhealthy choices to avoid feelings and all of these happen in automatic pilot. Let‚Äôs pause be aware of this precious gift of the present moment and begin to be aware of our choices. Look up for your ‚Äúmojo‚Äù, your ‚Äúfor what‚Äù I want to loose weight. Remember each one of us is a beautiful and gorgeous being and we want to fulfill our purpose, enjoy life at the fullest, share and be there for the ones we love, for all your f that and much more we need to be energized, healthier‚Ä¶. It is NOT a matter of having a ‚Äúskinny body as a model‚Äù, it is about your ‚Äúwhy you want to be healthier, vigorous, energized‚Äù. Be courageous, BE BOLD!! Thank you WW and I am very grateful that Oprah is part of your team.

Also, I do not appreciate the social/political interests that we put on connect with supporting BLM, or the pride parades or anything like that I don‚Äôt want that on my WW app to help me lose weight it doesn‚Äôt help me lose weight it adds stress to my life because it‚Äôs all over TV so if we could get rid of that too, I have been in weight watchers for the last seven years consecutively and I love it but I want my workshop back in Carson City Nevada ü§óüòâ and just one more thing I‚Äôm not real happy with the Oprah thing she does not represent me in any aspect of my life! I know it‚Äôs about the money, but there‚Äôs a lot of us who could care less if she‚Äôs there.

Title: WW app supports wellness journey
----------------------------------------------------------
I returned to Weight Watchers (rebranded as WW) in February 2021, while still staying at home as much as possible. The app is much improved since I last used it in 2016. I attended the WW new member and app academy virtual workshops, which helped me learn the features of the app. Food pillar: The tracking function is the workhorse of the app. It works well enough for me. I tracked everything I put in my mouth since Feb. The vast majority of the time the food is already in the database. I added food twice, created recipes ~20 times. I used some of the WW recipes - all good. Activity pillar: I linked the app to my FitBit. In order for it to work, I had to allow more access than I prefer but the convenience of syncing was worth it to me. I like the access to the exercise videos. Sleep pillar: Another convenience of syncing with my FitBit is that my sleep log loads into the WW app. I choose not to log my sleep into the app by hand. The additional wellness wins are not enough incentive for the inconvenience. Mindset pillar: The audio coaching and Headspace audios are incredible. They are helpful to listen to, even over and over again. Workshop finder helped me find not only virtual workshops but also my local studio. Connect, the online community turned out to be more worthwhile than I expected. I joined my coach‚Äôs connect group, which helped my journey. I checked in twice a week.

Title: I love the WW App
----------------------------------------------------------
I am returning to WW after many years and the app has improved exponentially!  I have used the scanner and it has found everything I have used it on when before it was about 1 out of 10 items would be found.  I'm enjoying the smart points system and eating fruit again after toying with Atkins for almost two years.  I like that it synchronizes with my Fitbit.  One thing that miss is tracking my water consumption.  (WW has listened and now has water tracking). I like that recipes are built into the app and the ones I have made have been fantastic! I also think having a place where you could write a daily journal would be a great addition to the app.  (WW now has a journal section under the weight tracker). However I think adding  it to the daily It could be a great way to note how you were feeling to perhaps help you define if you were emotionally eating and whether you were at a party and that was the reason for consuming a bunch of weekly points and even what your workout was like that day, etc.  I just think that would be a great thing to add.  Also I have an Apple Watch and I do like the quick add feature and frequently eaten items feature and think it would be great to add a water tracker to the watch app.  WW and all of the successful losers have proven that tracking works and this is a wonderful and extremely useful app!

Title: Wonderful
----------------------------------------------------------
This is the first time I have used WW and I don‚Äôt know why. My wife had great success losing 80 lbs. The cool thing is that she used her points so she could still drink her wine! I had tried Adkins years ago and had success but this time, after several months of stalling - I just couldn‚Äôt start, for whatever reason. I looked at Laurie and saw her -80lbs. success and hey- why not try WW? So, I have. And I must say, this App is fantastic. I have an advantage bc Laurie has experience with this, so I can ask her questions and she pretty much knows the answers. That said, this app is the most supportive, complete and informative app of any kind I‚Äôve used. It‚Äôs truly designed to help you succeed and keep you on track. It covers so many foods-it‚Äôs incredible! The scanner is so convenient! I scan foods at the grocery store, see how many points it is, then either buy it or put it back on the shelf. That‚Äôs just one of the amazing things about this app. If you go out to eat, they have a bazillion restaurants in their data base with almost everything on their menu listed. This helps you make the best decision you can if you must eat out. Changing eating habits is tough and this app is there for you. Do it now- commit and this will help you beyond what I can tell you. Good luck!

Title: Life changing!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was skeptical about WW, but then decided that I‚Äôll never know if I never try. BEST choice in my life. The app is super handy and easy to use. I am not good with technology or social type apps, but this walks you straight through. Beginning to end. It is set up to completely accommodate you, the user. It will ask when you tend to eat the most, what your diet is, what your goals are. It‚Äôs wonderful! You can choose whether or not you want to be social with the WW community. I chose not to be and I am glad I made that choice just because there is one downfall... and I realize it‚Äôs the internet and there are keyboard warriors out there, but people are not always the most positive, uplifting, or even keep things weight loss related on there. Me personally, I feel, (and maybe this is silly?) that maybe there should be monitoring or something because, I see a lot of post about people being mean to others and that‚Äôs not cool no matter what the app is. This in particular though, is supposed to be encouraging and up lifting. This is a life changer for the better quality of people‚Äôs lives! That would be my only problem with the app. Otherwise five stars all the way!! To anybody that reads this I hope this helps encourage you to make a step towards making a positive change!

Title: The best nutrition plan I‚Äôbe EVER tried!
----------------------------------------------------------
My journey with nutrition and exercise in order to improve my overall health has been difficult. I have tried many diets ranging from low calorie to Keto to other crash diets and nothing has ever been sustainable for me. Just over a year ago I decided to give weight watchers a try because I had remembered a family member tried it a long time ago and had some success. Weight watchers has really help me develop a different perspective on eating as I don‚Äôt have to necessarily fixate on carbs calories or fat weight watchers really simplifies all of that by using the point system for daily food consumption. This system has been by far the best thing that I have tried and has helped me lose and keep off about 10 pounds since last December. My results could be way better at this point but due to having Covid multiple times and being a graduate student was stressed I fell off the whack in a few times but I am back on and expecting to have a good outcome. Again I feel that this is the most realistic plan one could try as it is flexible, you don‚Äôt have to give up fruits or other snacks that you want you just have to be more concerned about the portions that you‚Äôre having. Definitely a program that I believe many people could thrive off of long-term.

Title: WW app
----------------------------------------------------------
I love it. The app makes entering meals and activity easy and fun. I am having a little trouble searching for ‚Äúingredients‚Äù rather than pre-cooked food items by national restaurants and chains from my iphone. I figure that‚Äôs a ‚Äúpicnic‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt usually affect my otherwise very positive experience with the app. And I love Connect! I go there to see the many virtual kindnesses that people extend to people who are struggling and need some support. That tells me that the community works together to hold that space for people who need that support with the challenges of weight loss, body image, gender roles, physical health issues, mental health challenges, addictions, and healing in our country where bullying, racism, and other societal problems that divide the usa and many other parts of the world. I give some of the credit for that to Oprah whose own healing from adverse childhood experiences and the role she created for herself as a leader in American culture for the health and well-being of Black people, all women, and other American minority people. Go, WW. Thanks from me. And I‚Äôve lost about 16 pounds since June 3rd or so. Appreciate the support from the lifetimers, coaches, member chefs who have blogs for recipes. Cool community.

Title: My safe place
----------------------------------------------------------
No matter what I need whether it‚Äôs encouragement, inspiration, a venting place, a place to share my successes and my struggles, the community that has been created via WW Connect is nothing short of amazing. It‚Äôs the salve to everything that is awful about social media. The app keeps getting better and easier to track any food, get recipe ideas, restaurant menus, even see other foods people have created and logged. Activity is tracked as well and you can set any goal you want. My favorite things are: #1 barcode scanner and #2 blue dots. To explain, there are tens of thousands of food items in the WW databanks with points values available for your reference. Immediately upon scanning, you can choose the weight or measurement of that food item and instantly log it in your daily tracker. If I see someone else at the grocery store scanning barcodes with their phone, we can‚Äôt help but smile and nod at each other. üòÅ The blue dot is a daily ‚Äúat-a-glance‚Äù look at whether you are eating within your healthy points range. Super helpful and also sometimes the source of a weekly challenge I give myself. üîµüëçüåü If you‚Äôre ready to manage your life with a focus on overall health, balance and positivity stop looking anywhere else and start here.

Title: So nice and easy to use
----------------------------------------------------------
I started mid January on weight watchers and I can honestly say if you‚Äôre serious about losing weight and keeping it off this is the way to do it. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason to be hungry to set yourself up to fail. There‚Äôs room for days when you need to eat or cheat, whatever you‚Äôd like to call it. In any event this diet should work for every lifestyle and you should not go hungry. I do not drink alcohol so I don‚Äôt know how that factors in but the points are the points. I often time say to myself and my partner, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm losing weight with all of this fruit that I eat. Sometimes I eat 4 to 6 servings of fruit a day. I also treat myself to the weight watchers snack bar peanut butter and chocolate. It‚Äôs like two bites and enough to satisfy the sweet tooth urge for two points. I also had a revelation about microwave popcorn which also is satisfying. I just got a healthy pop from jolly time of 100 cal bags. I was just about to check out the points and the review option came up. Well happy trails to all of you in your journey with weight watchers but I just don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find it all that much of a challenge if you‚Äôre a newbie

Title: My personal story from Ron of Frankfort Illinois
----------------------------------------------------------
Using this app makes your life tremendously easier !! Whether it‚Äôs at your house or someone else‚Äôs great choices can be made without stress added. Before joining weight watchers it took 12 months to lose 40 pounds .Then I went off gained 12 pounds in 4 months. Joined weight watchers and lost 20 pounds in just 4 weeks ,without zero exercise except stretching in bed during commercials. All while eating more than double the amount of food then I could eat before . Good choices and not skipping is key!!! This is a permanent life style not a diet!!!Im leaving for a trip to south padre island and I‚Äôm bringing snacks and dressing with me ,So again no stress about what to eat ! My total success came because my wife realized she needed a life style change to!! It took me along time to get her to see that . But my thinking is better later than never!!! Having a spouse life style change with you brings permanent successes. There is no longer pies lying around constantly helping to make bad emotional eating choices. So thanks again wife for working together. I hope this helps other people that working together really brings body and soul health.

Title: WW Review
----------------------------------------------------------
I love a lot of things about the app! The plan has been easy to follow, there are a ton of resources available, and the daily tracking have all helped me lose almost 47 lbs! One thing I don‚Äôt love about the app is the weekly canned responses - ‚ÄúCongratulations xxx! You stayed within your Budget several days this week and it paid off.‚Äù I faithfully tracked my food and stayed within my Budget for 6 solid months!!!  I lost weight consistently every week~ to the same response every week. When I first started the response was a little varied, you‚Äôve lost x% of your body fat, you‚Äôve lost x lbs, way to go! I think that should continue throughout a person‚Äôs weight loss journey. I‚Äôm almost within a healthy ideal weight range and there‚Äôs no encouragement to get there other than the canned ‚ÄúCongratulations........‚Äù I‚Äôm almost at my goal weight and there‚Äôs nothing to push me to get there. I know I should not be motivated solely by the app but I think the matrix of the app could do better! What happens when I reach my goal weight? Do I just continue? Is there a maintenance/lifetime plan? Do I still pay monthly once my goal is reached?

Title: Overpriced, needs improvement
----------------------------------------------------------
I decided to give Weight Watchers a try when they offered a reduced cost for an introductory period. I felt I needed a boost to my dietary regimen and also was looking for a way to improve my Type II diabetes numbers. I opted for the 6-month intro, and after 4 months I have, indeed, learned a lot and improved my health and lost weight. HOWEVER! I've also used My Fitness Pal for over 10 years, it's database is superior to the WW database, data entry is more intuitive, and virtually all the same types of community support options are available through MFP as through WW, but for a fraction of the price (if you opt for the MFP paid version, which I prefer to the free version). While using WW, I have simultaneously continued to use MFP, and will continue the lessons I've learned from WW but for much less cost. The WW interface is, I feel, lacking in functionality. I find myself using MFP first, and now only using WW as a check on my carb and fats intake. I've now adjusted my MFP daily nutritional goals to reflect the kinds of goals I learned from WW, so for the limited time I've used WW it was worth it, but not on a continuum.

Title: Keep on counting
----------------------------------------------------------
Even though I am lifetime and I am below my goal I still depend on this app to keep myself in check. Any new products I say or new restaurants I have not been to before I pull out my phone and check the points. Getting it off was a battle but keeping it off in the war. And I do not ever want to go back where I was. As of this morning I have lost 54 pounds and I am thrilled with what I have done. Don‚Äôt ever give upAnd don‚Äôt ever stop trying to make yourself better and happier. And with this app I feel I always have a friend with me to keep poking me and say hey that‚Äôs too many points. I am still way below my goal and use this app every day. It keeps me on track and helps me decide what to eat Ahead of time So I can plan ahead for each day. If you think this is a pain well maybe it is but I have decided I‚Äôm worth it and I‚Äôm doing this for me. I‚Äôve got this thank you very much it. This is my third time commenting on this app I can never say enough good about it it is helping me immensely to keep my weight down and I don‚Äôt think I could‚Äôve made it without this app please continue with it and thank you for doing it I love it

Title: WW to me üòä
----------------------------------------------------------
WW is a great program!!! It does work for everyone if you give it a chance. This journey is a true life changing adventure that you have to be ready for, for it to be successful.  Life is hard, but losing weight is harder. Tracking and going to meeting are extremely important. Showing up, weighing in weekly; making yourself accountable is an important key to your success. The little goals that you set for yourself is so worth it!!! And if the scale this week doesn‚Äôt show it don‚Äôt give up!!!! Just remember ...that if it doesn‚Äôt show on the scale that it‚Äôs not a defeat!!!!!, but a ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù result. As long as you whole heartily stuck to your plan, the scale # doesn‚Äôt matter...the scale doesn‚Äôt show inches lost...remember that! I‚Äôm not going to say that it‚Äôs all rainbows and unicorns....At first it is so frustrating, and time consuming to figure out your ‚Äúpath for success ‚Äú!! But just remember that Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day and self perfection takes time!!! Be patient with yourself and you will be successful!!!! I can honestly say that the WW plan does truly work, and it is totally worth all of the effort! üòä

Title: Love the App!
----------------------------------------------------------
Easy to use, and helpful for every pillar of the My WW+ Program. I can scan bar codes to help me decide what to purchase right there at the grocery store! Sometimes it is easier to say, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù once. The 5 min Coaching has amazing 1-5 min Audio files to help with stress, setting an intention for the day, and so much more. You can easily access the Weekly Topic and techniques on the Discover Tab. It is nice to be able to go back to older techniques, too! Great follow up tool! I also love the filter section under Discover Recipes- You can filter to your specific dietary needs and preferences. Once you set it up as Gluten Free, egg free, lunch ideas, etc... you will only see the recipes that interest you. You can also type in ‚ÄòNo cook‚Äô or ‚ÄòOne pot meals‚Äô, and again, you only see those types of recipes. We have two free activity tabs, too! They are filled with activities- Audio or Video based on your preferences- You can filter these to meet your activity level as well as upper body, lower body, strengthening, etc..The Restaurant section is a game changer for eating out. The WW App is a very useful tool. Loveeeee it!

Title: Easy useful app!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is so easy to use and navigate! It‚Äôs never frozen up or given me problems (which is amazing in app world). I really like the iPad version but that could be because it‚Äôs a bigger screen and the keyboard makes typing in for tracking easier. The phone app is great when grocery shopping because I can pull up the barcode scanner and see the points associated with different foods. That feature has saved me from buying things that I thought would have had lower points than they did. I also love all the recipes so readily accessible on the site. I star my favorites and also add my own recipes so I can keep track of them as well. Looking up meal points by restaurant name is a cool feature but there are many popular places in my area that aren‚Äôt included in the list of restaurants so that‚Äôs probably the least useful feature of the app for me. If they expand it to include regionally popular restaurants, then it would be more beneficial to me. But, I try to fix my own food at home for the most part so really, this app is excellent for helping me be mindful about what I‚Äôm eating along with my activity level.

Title: Love the WW App!
----------------------------------------------------------
I did WW several years ago, before there was an app. I lost weight, but as soon as I reached goal I quit tracking points because it was such a pain to go into my home office and track after each meal, especially after eating out. If I was on vacation or away from home on business, I couldn‚Äôt track at all. Without tracking, I got back into old habits and slowly gained the weight back over the years. I started again on WW last July and the app makes a world of difference! When I go out to eat, the app is with me on my phone! Away for business or pleasure? The app is with me!  Also, they have automatic entries of points for many national restaurant chains. I used it when I went to Olive Garden and Outback with my mother, and I was able to find delicious, sensible things to eat! My phone is always with me, so it makes it super easy to look up point values, make decisions, and track. In short, I love the portability of the app and I love its features. There‚Äôs also the ability to chat with a WW coach 24/7! I plan to be using the app and tracking for the rest of my life so I can maintain all my hard won losses.

Title: First real app that visibly holds me accountable for what I eat
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app. I have struggled with weight loss for over ten years now. Well I guess you can‚Äôt really struggle when you haven‚Äôt put forth an effort of trying to lose weight. However, this app is helping to change my mindset and the ways that I usually eat. I‚Äôve been so used to eating whatever I wanted when I wanted that I forgot about the consequences. I was a gymnast for fifteen years and nationally ranked judo player for years but my mentality was that of, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep this fit body forever.‚Äù Well it turns out you are what you eat. So it is the new year of 2020 and I have started this weight watchers program and intend to use it to get to my goal of 90 pounds lost. This app helps me see what I can and cannot eat and what I should eat less of. The point system visually lets you know that the choices you make are ones that will either benefit you or break you. So I choose wisely. We are in this together and this app has the community to back it up. There is nothing but support and groups of people that actually know the real struggles we face as an individual and as a group. This is a life changer.

----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been a WW member on and off for 30 years. I am so impressed and overjoyed for all the changes WW is making to their program and app. It‚Äôs so easy to track your meals and activity now. They‚Äôve just included sleep tracking too with access to meditation before bed at Headspace. They‚Äôve incorporated exercise videos of all time lengths. They‚Äôve added the ability to include feelings and journal what made you successful or what you struggled with. Countless more things like online support from WW community and helping you meal plan with ingredients currently in your pantry. Great recipes too!!! Gone are the days of bland boring meals. Plus you now earn real rewards for your successes.   WW you are blowing up the old diet mentality and giving us tools we need!! Well done!!! I am a HUGE FAN!! My husband has lost 12 pounds in 6 weeks and I‚Äôve lost 18 pounds in 8 weeks. This is a huge success for us and the longest we‚Äôve followed program since 1989 and I owe it to the fantastic changes you‚Äôve made to the program that help me stay focused on my health journey. I haven‚Äôt been this hopeful in decades.

Title: Nothing is perfect
----------------------------------------------------------
The app is a helpful tool to have on the journey of living a healthy life.  For all the good things there are some things that need fixing/tweaking. The barcode scanner is great.  I'm not sure if there is maximum number of foods that can be stored in the scanned list but foods that I've previously scanned are not there. Tracking foods/meals is easy. Having frequently used items is convenient. Reviewing previous entries is a bit of a pain. You have to scroll, slowly, back through EVERY DAY instead of just going to a specific day. Having a water tracker on the home screen would be helpful. I use another app to keep me on track with water consumption. The weight tracking feature is good. The auto generated messages are cute and encouraging. The WW social media outlet, Connect, is like going to a meeting whenever you want!  But....after using other (FREE) media outlets, certain features are expected. The ability to see things you've liked would be helpful. To "refresh" your feed requires scrolling, manually, back to the top!üôÑ. I'm committed to my lifestyle change so I'll continue to use the app.

Title: Best Program ever!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been a Weight Watcher since I was a teenager.  I would do well for a time.  Stop. Then come back again.  I believe I may have been on at least 5-10 different programs over time. I never achieved goal.  I would get discouraged, felt hungry, and most often after losing a bit of weight thought I had this and didn‚Äôt need the help.  Well, it‚Äôs now 50 yrs later. I have tried magic pills and exercise with poor if no results. Last year I read all I could about all the different plans and false hope ideas pushed out by the Media.  The last plan I reviewed was WW and I saw something new based on years of research and trials by so many people. What the heck, I‚Äôll try again.  So I‚Äôm losing about 2 lbs. a week, I‚Äôm on Blue and it is so easy.  I use the online tracking and weigh in.   The bottom line is you have to want to do this, it is a life change, there will be good weeks and bad weeks.   Be true to yourself and take it a day at a time.  People are different and lose differently.  Don‚Äôt compare yourself to others.  Make this your new life. ‚ù§Ô∏è

So again I‚Äôm still paying and I‚Äôm at Sept1 I started but I understood it better! I knew what and how to eat & eat lots of free foods I don‚Äôt count ots anymore because I get the entire program! Do ad of today I lost 40+ minus a few treatsüòÇ WW I‚Äôll eat like this 4 ever! I Also did a tummy tuck yrs ago so even now my pants are a medium. 8 or 6 at times . I can‚Äôt go by your goal weight in the beginning I had surgerys and breast & tummy tuck Iüíó my weight now minus 6 more. have 4 chunk chunk friends! They all want me to write it down! Nope it‚Äôs ti confusing in the beginning like 6 m until you get what works best to your body! I hated purple! Ppl love it pasta rice all what we miss. But I tried it and I gained 3kb! I guess you have to get this program & live by it. You‚Äôll lose weight and then you gain weight if not  but understand WW and it‚Äôs just perfect ! You can eat everything even the extra points I lost!

Title: Game Changer
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôll keep it brief... so I bought a scale after 3 years of not owning one and was up to 265 from 235. I had started showing signs of failure in my body that my P.A., Sister and Nurse, fianc√© had identified. Main indicator was the fluid on my ankles. Especially after eating anything with salt. After researching, I decided to try the WW app. In 6 months I‚Äôm down to 228 and headed to my goal of 215. No more swelling of the ankles and I can even have salt again without it creating an issue. One thing that the app has really done for me is to make different choices across the board. That is the true feature that can change the same old game that we have played, probably, our whole life with the weight roller coaster (which is really bad for you). Feeling great physically and mentally and looking forward to living longer because of the choices that WW has educated me to make. Of course, I already knew what I needed to do but this technic that why have created after decades of work, really hits you in the forehead like a 2x4! CHOOSE LIFE!

Title: I LOVE this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
It makes tracking easy and simple! I remember having to write everything down in those little journals and using a little slider to manually figure my points on every food item. Lol  I love all the recipe options or being able to create my own recipes and have it calculate the points for me. I love all the 0 pt foods on the purple plan. It just makes it almost too easy to loose weight. I love that you have just about all food brands and options point values available at my fingertips... and if something happens to not be there, you can use the built-in points calculator. I love being able to easily track my fluid intake. I love how easy it is to track my activity and how it automatically adds my points based on my personal settings. And the latest, I love that there are now exercise programs that I can filter down to my exact needs: type of exercise, time I want to spend (even just a few minutes), meditation-type options, and lots more that I haven‚Äôt yet explored! I love the ease of use of the entire app and program. Thank you!

Title: What a program! What an app!
----------------------------------------------------------
If you‚Äôre on the fence trying to decide whether or not to join weight watchers and use this awesome app, I would highly encourage you to do so. I‚Äôve used a lot of different apps and tried a lot of different diets, and this is the first time that I am truly motivated to change my eating habits simply by the use of the smart points which it figures for me. I‚Äôm only on day five, but I can already tell that this is going to work. I love the app. I can scan my food‚Äôs barcode or use the search feature, and all of the foods are in the database. And there are lots of ‚Äúfree‚Äù foods (zero points) that don‚Äôt count against your day‚Äôs points (which helps to program you to eat right). There‚Äôs an entire online community at your fingertips and everyone is so positive and encouraging. Having a bad day? Put it out there in the community and they will welcome you with open arms and provide lots of wonderful suggestions and encouragement. I get emotional writing this because I know I have finally found what I‚Äôve been looking for. Thank you WW!!!!!

Title: The app has vastly improved over the past five year
----------------------------------------------------------
Weight Watchers continues to be the only real thing that works and it‚Äôs been amazing to use the app as a measurment tool (much better than calorie counters) that steers you toward better choices. One thing I wish some in the community understood was that it can pair well with other thinking‚Äîit‚Äôs been a guide and great help this year as I‚Äôve switched my eating to Pesco-Mediterranean with an eight hour eating window (intermittent fasting). I‚Äôm focused on this based on recent studies on brain health and internal organ health and the possibility of delaying dementia and cognitive decline. I hope someone in development sees this as passes on to marketing that there are a lot of communities that could benefit from the app. Meanwhile, intermittent fasting has helped flip the switch on my sense of hunger and I‚Äôm much more able to stick to Weight Watchers. 42 pounds from my all time high and this time I‚Äôm able to stick to it. Please continue to add new features to the app and continue to add to your fantastic food database. Thank you!

Title: Can not lose a pound without help from the WW app
----------------------------------------------------------
Although I am a strong woman and think I can do anything, my weakness is cooking delicious food and then enjoying it. The WW app is the only way I can keep myself under enough control to manage the portions I eat. The best part is that I get to eat the things I cook and enjoy most, and still meet my weight goals. I‚Äôm not happy when I look overweight in my clothes!  Just goes against everything my Mom taught me, plus my personal feelings about weighing more than I should. Just portrays a certain laziness to me, and I am not at all lazy. Plus, I have no thyroid, so weight control is a constant battle. But, it is much less a battle with this app. Black and white numbers are hard to refute. And, if you think for one minute that you can lose weight while fudging a little on the numbers, you‚Äôre in for a big surprise!  Be truthful with the numbers and you‚Äôre the winner!!  I‚Äôm not new to this app. I‚Äôve been on and off it for years. So far, I have not found a sustainable alternative. Go for it!  You have a lot to lose!!

Title: Feeling the best I ever have
----------------------------------------------------------
Having done this program years ago - where you had to use books and calculators to figure your points...the app makes it so easy when you log your food. I love that my Apple Watch is synced to count my activity. The biggest benefit is the community - the support within the community is amazing. Love the water tracker. WW has made modifications to adapt to COVID-19, while we can‚Äôt have meetings in person, we can have them via zoom. I love our Zoom meeting, it is a merged group of three areas, I have been able to virtually meet people I never would have ‚Äî my WW support circle has gotten bigger. I have been on the plan for a year this time, and I am down 85 lbs ‚Äî 24 to go until my goal. I hit ONDERLAND! Self-esteem is at an all time high. I feel and look the best I ever have. I have gone from a size 24W to size 14 and top 24W to a 12, I haven‚Äôt been this size in over thirty years. For the first time in a long time, I love myself, I smile when I look in the mirror. This app is one of the keystones. #ThisIsMyJourney

Title: WW Member since 1970's. Love the App.
----------------------------------------------------------
I resisted not only the earlier WW apps, but the whole new WW+ program because I had one of the old programs memorized and had all my personal recipes marked with points.  After COVID hit and I was in Lockdown  I finally checked out WW+ and was impressed with the wholistic venue, which I have tried to follow most of my life. I have been a WW member since the 1970's. After learning the new program I decided to try the iPhone app. I am 88 years old and knew the learning curve would be time consuming. It has been just that, but I finally feel I have it figured out!  I can do so much more research on my phone than having to go to the desktop computer or trying to keep a written log!!  There are so many great features that once figured out, help me to work within the program. I am a power walker (former runner) and really like trading fit points for food points, as well as being able to track my walking and strength training. I never thought I would say this, but I love the app and the new WW+ program!!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I love the app. I love how you can track each day. And the app provides the smart points. It makes it so much easier than looking up the points. And I love connect. Sharing your journey with others. And being there for others as well as finding so many successful stories. The pictures help a lot. To see the difference a transaction does for someone. It‚Äôs not just a number on a scale. It‚Äôs the feeling of respect for yourself. Knowing that you CAN look better, feel better and be happier and healthier, mentally and physically. Ok I can not list all of the wonderful things this app can do for you. I just know I am glad I finally am opening up to real life and learning that I Can Do This. Thank you WW. The Blue Dots are helping me track faithfully. No matter what happens I want to stay in control of my weight. And the App helps me do this daily. Thank you WW for giving me happiness in my life. I just love using this app. Although I still have a lot to learn I am working on it every day and I will never give up.

Title: This app changed my life!
----------------------------------------------------------
I never really had a weight struggle all my life but after having two children I gained weight and even though it was 15-20lbs‚Ä¶it was a lot for me.  Over the years I tried quick fixes, 21 day diets and some keto but I had short term results and I always returned to the same original weight. My close friend suggested this option as she had done so months ago and was able to lose some significant weight.  I‚Äôm so grateful to her and WW because it works!!!  It is a slow process and there were times I was hard on myself when I didn‚Äôt lose two pounds EVERY week but six months later all my family and friends that said I didn‚Äôt need to lose weight look at me now and say Wow! You look terrific!!  And I feel amazing!! I feel healthy. I learned how to eat! I realized all my past bad habits that I thought were no big deal. The app makes you so much more aware and how to be flexible. I‚Äôm keeping this app even though I reached my goal because it keeps me accountable and the results are obvious!!!üíïüíïTHANK YOU WW!!!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è

Title: WW is AWESOME
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been doing WW for years!  I remember I joined in 2002 & got my lifetime in 2003!!!  WW has been the best thing I‚Äôve ever done for myself. My friend had been trying to get my to join, she was already LT.  I finally had enough money to join one weekend & so I went in & joined & told myself if it worked I‚Äôll stay with it, but if I don‚Äôt see anything I‚Äôm quitting.  This was back when there wasn‚Äôt Monthly Passes & you paid by the week.  Well the first weigh in I had lost 5 lbs & I was so excited!  I decided to pay for another week & it was also another loss.  So I just kept going every week & 80 pounds later I hit Lifetime!!!  I‚Äôll never forget that day!  Nothing has ever worked for me except WW!  I‚Äôll admit I still struggle a little with my weight but that‚Äôs only because I don‚Äôt track or exercise & I find it definitely shows at the scales!  But again that‚Äôs my fault & when I‚Äôve quit going for a year or more and decide to go back in, I‚Äôm always welcomed with open arms!  Thank you WW I truly love you!

Title: New technology and old school combined
----------------------------------------------------------
I started weight watchers again because I was in an accident and disabled. I have a lot of pain all the time and have gained a lot of weight due to not being able to exercise I also have depression from the pain all the time and not having a life I once had. I love the new technology that makes it easy to count the points but still like the old school. Would love to be able to count water intake on the app. I am now disabled and can‚Äôt do exercises but I did let it on the old forms where you had a place to check it all off. Have a check off box for the recommended serving of vegetables a day. If I was at a standstill and ate more vegetables I would lose faster. I also did weight watchers during counting the fiber content. On the search of foods I would like to see at a glance if I‚Äôm making a good choice based high fiber (hf) , low fat (lc) and low carbs high protein (hp). This way if someone wanted to do like the keto diet everything would be easier to make choices that best suits the person needs.

Title: Love the app - make a few changes
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has been a game-changer. Tracking is key to weight loss and the app makes it quick and easy. One change to make: I walk 3 miles every day and cannot track it on the app because I don‚Äôt wear a fitbit. I don‚Äôt want a fitbit and shouldn‚Äôt be limited for not wearing one. Another change to make: I signed up and pay for workshops. Because of that, I have received no notifications of the goals I keep achieving. I achieved 15lb, 20lb, 25lb, and total goals since the pandemic closed workshops. But I have received not one notice of accomplishment or a single keychain. I feel left out. It could be months before WW reopens. A key part of the program that brought me here is measuring success and celebrating goals along the way. This has been completely missing for over 10 weeks. I am disappointed that WW hasn‚Äôt learned this and adapted the program to our new realities. I believe that WW should be better than this. Don‚Äôt leave us workshop members to wait for ‚Äúsomeday ‚Äú when we can get together again.

Title: It works if you use it!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm been with WW since November.  Yes right before Thanks giving and down 20 pounds.  Why it works?  I know it‚Äôs due to the WW app.   Being able to Scan the food packages has been a complete eye opening to me.  The food I thought were healthy were NOT.  But I was also able to find food that I liked that were health and keep in freezer for when I‚Äôm in a hurry and just need to grab or don‚Äôt feel like cooking. Which is a lot of the time....And even if the food is healthy the amount I ate in a service was way to much so the app is wonderful for I‚Äôm able to make my our serving and still be able to enjoy the food.  LOVE that the app figures out everything so I don‚Äôt have to...  The app is a wonderful tool to teach me  the healthiest ways to eat .  To enjoy foods and enjoy being healthy.. I‚Äôve always said that your body is a temple and you only have the one.  No one but yourself can control your decision on keeping your temple healthy. So I‚Äôve decided to  take care of MY TEMPLE and enjoy food ,

Title: Terrific, life saving app
----------------------------------------------------------
So far, using this app and following healthy choices recommended by this app, I‚Äôve lost over 130 pounds. This day last year, I weighed 100 pounds more than I do today. I look great. I feel great. The app tracks my weight and what I eat, contains the tools I need to easily use the scientifically proven and easy Weight Watchers diet, and it contains decent healthy and delicious weight watchers recipes. The point system food database is enormous helping me quantitatively track how much I eat against a number relating to how much I can eat on a daily basis. Losing 130 pounds (so far) was easy using this app; the app allowed me to eat foods that taste good and made sure I was full every day. Moreover, when I reach my goal weight (in another 9 pounds)Weight Watchers  and it‚Äôs app have a plan that will help me maintain my goal weight. It‚Äôs worth the amount of money I spend on it. According to life expectancy charts, I may have gained another 25 years on my life! What other app does that?

Title: Weight loss as a diabetic:
----------------------------------------------------------
I am a type 1 diabetic and have a very tough time losing weight. I can‚Äôt be like most and say, it‚Äôs time to lose weight. After 8 months of being a ( previously achieved) lifetime member of weight watchers and numerous consults with my endocrinologist and my diabetic educator, I have reached my 1/2 way point. I  have a 70 pound weight loss goal and have gotten to 36.2 lost. I have reached my goal two times before but always went back up and then some.  I‚Äôm hoping the third time will be the charmer. This attempt, unlike my previous achievements, I am doing it online. I have always gone to meetings. Knowing what I need helps me get through rough patches. With diabetes, insulin adjustments are necessary as I lose. It is a slow crawl down but I‚Äôm advised that this is the healthiest way. Thanks Weight Watchers for all your support( gifts earned from points accumulated,etc). I hope to reach my goal by years end but whatever it takes my health & well being are worth it to me.

I should have signed up much sooner!  I LOVE this app so much!  I love tracking everything I eat and knowing how many more points I have for the rest of day, etc.  Plus this app gives you flexibility, in addition to providing amazing structure that I NEED.  I love and appreciate the weekly weighing part too because this keeps me in check if I need to adjust a little for the following week.  This app works wonders - lost weight gradually and in a very healthy way!  What a dream come true that I reached my goal in a - happy & healthy way and not from some excessively stressful period.  I will continue to use this app for life because I can‚Äôt imagine being without this app now.  Also, I love the WW products too like the snacks (barbecue chips) and the frying Pan too - so many outstanding products!  The motivating navy blue cards I received in the mail for reaching ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù with the cute little gifts inside the cards gave me huge boosts too!  Thank you so much WW!

I love weight watchers app. I started out tracking in a weight watchers journal and using the smart points calculator but found it difficult due to poor handwriting and lack of math skill. I signed up for the app this winter and have been using it every day since. I love the meetings as well. I have successfully lost and kept off 8 pounds and 6 ounces What is great about the app is you can type in a food or activity and find out the points value or fit points. I also like Connect, which is where you can post about your weight loss journey and Wellness Wins rewards which is when you track meals, you get 5 points per meal, activity tracking is also 5 points, sleep tracking is 5 as well snd 50 points for attending your weekly workshop in person and weighing in. After you‚Äôve reached Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 you can choose a reward based on how many points it costs and how many you‚Äôve earned. This reward is shipped and is free of cost including shipping and handling.

Title: Weight loss journey
----------------------------------------------------------
My weight loss journey began in the last quarter of 2017- I found the app to be my best friend - I always have my phone and can scan or look up anything- I was shocked at the amount of points I was putting in my body with gourmet coffee drinks- I never felt I was a bad eater I just ate the wrong things at the wrong time- I lost 70 lbs by July of 2018- very consistent (around 10 lbs a month) I did feel like I had trouble maintains my goal weight- I continued to lose about 10 more pounds than I needed to be at a healthy weight- I had just come so accustom to what I was eating.  I did began not tracking in Nov of 2019 and have been working from home since March is 2020- I have gained 30 lbs from my lowest weight but I am back on track - scanning everything and my goal is to lose 20lbs.  Tracking by far is the healthiest and easiest way to keep on track and the WW app makes it easy and seeing your numbers everyday feels so rewarding- thanks for a wonderful program

Title: App fails to work with no official updates and very slow responses
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm writing this on a Monday, I just joined the program on a Saturday morning logged into the app, and started using it all enthusiastically. Sunday morning bright and early app doesn't work-- tried rebooting phone, tried uninstalling and reinstalling, nothing on their website about an outage.. Went to their Facebook page and through scrolling saw other people had the same issue, with each person replied to from weight watchers saying they were looking into it. Now 24 hours later same problem. As I look through The Internet I see that this is been a consistent problem that they have had at least back into the fall, that's as far as I looked back so far. It's a shame to have a great program and not have an app that works. If this doesn't get better I'm going to ask for a refund and quit. I'm not sure how something like my fitness pal can be running this long with no issues but a program like weight watchers who makes millions can't even have an app that works.

Title: ‚ù§Ô∏è tracking
----------------------------------------------------------
I really love tracking.  Since our zoom group is talking about pathways I‚Äôll talk about mine. I‚Äôve been a member off and on most of my life.  I‚Äôd lose maybe 25 pounds than revert back to the well used path.  I could not stay on that less traveled path until I started tracking.  It was a gradual buildup to getting on the path less traveled.  I usually track each meal but sometimes I do it after dinner.  I track whatever I eat.  This way I know why I‚Äôm up or down.  One day this past week I tracked over 60 points.  I was eating my feelings.  My coach said she was proud of me for recognizing that‚Äôs what I was doing.  A few years ago I wouldn‚Äôt have known that.  Tracking is my history of the path or journey I‚Äôm on.  I know if I want to continue to be a lifetime member I need to stay on this path.  The changes are amazing and make me feel strong and proud of myself.  I sincerely hope people will continue on their path whatever that is.  I‚Äôm cheering for you.üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª

Title: Love this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used this app faithfully each day for 2 months since joining Weight Watchers and have lost over 20 pounds during that time. This app makes it super easy to type or scan in the food that you eat, and it keeps track of it all for you, leaving no guesswork behind. It allows you to put in entire recipes, then it calculates points per serving for you. Every food you could imagine is listed in here, including many, many restaurant items. It also allows you to put in activities that you do, the Fitness points you receive from them, and syncs up with your fitness devices such as Fitbit and Apple Watch. This app is also chock full of Weight Watchers recipes for all three meal times to give you some ideas if you need them. *NOTE: You do have to be a member of Weight Watchers and will need to provide your user name and password in order to use this app. But if you are serious about losing weight, the Weight Watchers program and this app are totally worth it!

Title: Wish I could save a portion of a meal.
----------------------------------------------------------
I like ‚Äúsaving a meal‚Äù from a restaurant, however the app just doesn‚Äôt do what I want. We like to frequent a Mexican Restaurant and I sometimes order the okra chicken enchilada dinner, with refried beans, Mexican rice, and have white queso and chips. It‚Äôs an expensive WW points meal, but well worth using some wkly points. I track all the items separately, and then save it as a meal. However, I rarely eat the entire dinner because there is just too much food. I like to bring home half the meal for another day. I wish I could enter the entire entree, save it as a meal, then select how much I ate. Yesterday, I ate half the entree leaving the other half for tomorrow. Although, sometimes I might eat more than half, like 5/8ths or 3/4ths. It would be helpful if I could enter the portion of the ‚ÄúSaved Meal‚Äù I ate instead of going thru and ‚Äúupdating items‚Äù individually. It would make it so much easier if I could enter how much of the total entree I consumed.

Title: WW: A Lifeline on the Journey to Healthy Eating
----------------------------------------------------------
I have turned to WW many times in my life. When I first started, in the 60‚Äôs, all attendees would applaud those singled out for even a loss of  half a pound! As WW has evolved, such gestures have disappeared. Instead, more significant weight loss is acknowledged and more sophisticated tools exist to help you attain that weight loss. I had never even considered using WW‚Äôs online tracking but Covid-19 changed my attitude. What every dieter needs is accountability. It is so easy to convince yourself your food intake is less than it actually is. With a tracking option right on your phone, you can see clearly how many points you have accrued. It has been instrumental in my success and I love it. But while WW has been the most helpful resource in the history of dieting, it is my own determination, my own mindset that I am most proud of, and WW helped create that. The technology that they have made available and the support they provide are invaluable!

Title: Great Way To Stay on Track - Need a Water Tracker
----------------------------------------------------------
I love how easy this app is to use.  My favorite highlights: scanned foods stay in the memory bank so if I go back to buy something at a later time, the item is already stored and I can track it right away.  I like the community aspect and the motivation of seeing all the members‚Äô posts popping up to keep me on track or help me push past some barriers.  Slow and steady, right?  The Restaurants section is one of my faves because I am always on the go with my kids and it is especially handy to either check points by restaurant or find a restaurant based on my remaining points.  Very handy!  My ONE VERY IMPORTANT NEED/REQUEST: a water tracker.  Please please PLEASE create an update with a way to keep track of water consumption.  I know I need more.  And as diligent as I am with tracking meals and snacks and points, I‚Äôd love the ability to make note of my water, too!  Please include this in a future update to make one very happy and hydrated WWer.

Title: So Easy
----------------------------------------------------------
My sister-in-law was on WW when she came for Thanksgiving. I ate what she did for the week she visited and lost 4-lbs. I joined on December 3rd. When my husband saw how well I was doing he decided to join also. The app makes it so easy to track your food and points. I scan the barcode on new food items as I am grocery shopping to decide on what brand to buy and save the item to track. The WW recipes are amazing; lower calories but still flavorful. We now eat a lot more turkey, chicken and fish. Both of our primary physicians were surprised at our last checkups due to our weight loss (my blood pressure is also down). To date, I have lost 28-lbs; went from size 10 to size 6 and soon to be size 4. My husband has done amazing; he has lost 94-lbs! He went from size 3XL, 48‚Äù waist to size XL, 38‚Äù waist. We both feel so much better. We walk at least 10,000 steps every day. Have more energy, less aches and pains, and are happy with the way we look.

Title: Accountability
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been trying to lose weight forever.  Part of the issue was stress eating.  Retiring from my full-time and part-time job gave me the time and environment to address my weight issue.  I tried numerous different weight loss plans with varying degrees of success.  This was during the Pandemic year.  Finally, after getting fully vaccinated, I decided to get serious and went back to the one plan that had always worked for me in the past‚ÄîWW.  I never liked the points plans  and preferred the old plans.  But, I decided to try the points plan again and it was a breeze!  I‚Äôm on the Blue plan and the app holds me accountable.  I enter my food every day and to date I‚Äôve lost 51 pounds.  The app is quick and accurate.  I can look up food choices and also add new foods to my plan.  Normally, I‚Äôm a paper and pen person, but this app is everything and I know it‚Äôs going to help me continue on my weight loss journey and help when I reach maintenance.

Title: Weight Watchers App is incredible!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Over the last 20 years I‚Äôve lost weight using Weight Watchers principles a few different times. When I was going to Weight Watchers there was no such thing as an ‚ÄúApp‚Äù for anything. We went to the meetings, weighed in once a week, and together lost weight and learned to change what we eat. It worked! Unfortunately the three times I reached my goal I eventually lost track and gained the weight back. This has happened once again until recently I decided enough was enough and the first thing that came to mind was how successful I was at Weight Watchers. As I began to look into signing up again it became apparent there was this Weight Watchers App that I could join instead of going to in person meetings, and what with the pandemic still an issue, I decided to give the app a try, so I signed up for it, and downloaded it. I have been using the app for about a week and a half, and find the App to be amazing! There are so many things wrapped up

Title: WW app
----------------------------------------------------------
The WW App is easy to navigate. It supports me on my weight loss journey. The bar scanner is a very helpful tool to use in the grocery store. With the scanner, I can easily see if the grocery product does or does not work for my plan. It offers choices. Choices to find communities of people who share my goals. I can also find and try out virtual workshops and find the Coach who will motivate me. There are also choices of workouts and 5 minute coaching sessions that zero in on the help I need. The 24/7 availability of coaches and customer service provides immediate help to my questions of how to effectively use the app and the WW+ Program. I am succeeding because of the apps multitude of layers that help to lead me on the path I choose and create. There is so many great aspects of the app. WW is the best weight loss program that I have ever been on and the app helps me to participate thoughtfully, thoroughly, and easily. I can do this!

Title: WEIGHT WATCHERS SAVED ME!!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I never thought I‚Äôd lose weight ever! A co-worker of mine introduced me to WW because she had amazing results with the app! And I must say it‚Äôs super easy to use and you can eat whatever you want but basically you‚Äôre eating in moderation and you just track it and that‚Äôs it! But what I love about this app is that whatever you track, it adds into points where you can redeem amazing prizes so basically you‚Äôre getting rewarded for every little thing you track such as your weight, your eating and your exercises! I love this app and I have lost 15 pounds while on this app so far and I‚Äôm truly amazed! I definitely would recommend the weight watchers app for anyone who wants to lose weight whether it‚Äôs a little or a lot and the fact that this app has a community connect that allows you to connect with people who are doing the same thing as you is a God send!! Whoever created the WW app, thank you and you are a blessing in disguise! ü§ó

Title: WW ‚Äòs Freestyle program plus this app equals success
----------------------------------------------------------
I was skeptical when I started this WW freestyle program. I tried weight watchers  many years ago and was not successful. I have tried several programs in the past with limited or no success. I could not sustain the programs. I would gain back because I had not change my lifestyle and diets are not sustainable. This Free Style program with the help of this App leads you into a  healthy stainable lifestyle change I find the program is not limiting and the App makes staying on target so easy whether I am planning meals at home or going out to eat. When I shop in the store I can scan bar codes and check the points  for various foods and this helps me have a wide variety choices  of foods. I thought  keeping track of the foods I eat would be a pain but the App makes it easy and really helps me I am track and keep myself honest. I am losing weight I do not feel like I am on a diet! I feel that the App is essential to my success .

Title: Holds me accountable without shaming me!
----------------------------------------------------------
Let‚Äôs face it...being overweight is no fun. I have struggled with carrying too much weight on my body throughout my life, but more so since I stopped running marathons and battled breast cancer twice. Oh, and I have digestive issues. I avoided being in pictures or shopping for clothes, opting to live in yoga pants and oversized tops or hoodies as much as possible. I reached my limit when I had trouble with my left knee and ankle that caused difficulty as I tried to get back to my feet after playing on the floor with my sweet nephew. I knew I needed help. More than anything, I needed guidance on portion control of the foods I can eat safely. This app has been a silent partner that encourages me to think about the choices I make on the food I consume.  Better yet, it is a partner that never passes judgment! It rewards me when I have a great day and helps me refocus when I have a challenging day. I am grateful for the support!

Title: Exciting
----------------------------------------------------------
Love the versatility and format because eating the WW way becomes clear and real! There are many choices which makes it easier to follow. I‚Äôve become more aware of what I have to do to maintain my weight. I have learned and forgive myself when I get off track because I just know it is easy to get back on track. I‚Äôve become more aware of the importance of exercising. I was really taken back when I saw how much work it takes to burn off just 100 calories. It makes me think twice about taking another bite of something high in calories. I don‚Äôt feel like I am missing out on anything because WW offers so many delicious choices that satisfy my cravings. I love the WW way. I am trying to maintain a size six and I know with WW it is doable. I have less pain and stress on my joints. I play tennis and I get to almost all the balls because I move faster! Thank you WW for being there. I love your coaching both online and in person!

Title: WW App is fantastic!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love the WW App. I started WW in April 2018 by using the App exclusively. I have done very well using this App in my quest to get healthy. The barcode scanner is crucial. I also know there‚Äôs support if I need it but so far the App has been my mainstay. Losing weight slowly has allowed me to internalize the choices I need to make to stay healthy. My main goal was to control and/or reduce medical episodes in a positive way by losing weight. This has come true for me! I still have about 22 pounds to go to goal but I know with the help of the App I will succeed. I will not stop using the App at goal. My big goal is to maintain my weight loss which I know I can do with the App. Many will want the support of the meetings and I know from past experience how helpful those are. I think if an individual will be honest and track you too can be successful just using the app. It‚Äôs a great tool and very helpful.

Title: Love!
----------------------------------------------------------
In the past I‚Äôve stuck to free calorie counting programs - MyFitnessPal, LoseIt! Etc. I‚Äôve always found myself discouraged every time I start these though and stressing about calories. These programs also do not encourage you to make healthier food choices, but focus on calories. I love the weight watchers program because it‚Äôs different. You‚Äôre given a certain amount of points (depends on the plan you choose) to eat each day. Every food has a certain point value assigned to it. Foods that are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù for you, like veggies, fruits and lean meats, have a low point value. This encourages you to make healthier food choices while allowing you to still feel full. The 24/7 coaching is so nice too! I love to be able to ask someone a question without having to dig through countless forums. The 23 dollars a month is so worth it! The community on the app is great too, and there‚Äôs lots of ways to get involved!

I love the app but wish there was a way to go back and enter my eating and activities for the previous day. There have been times when I‚Äôve been crazy busy and didn‚Äôt get my food and activities logged in before midnight.  I‚Äôm so thrilled to have the studios opening up again. They make such a difference for me. Meetings help keep my head screwed on right. They set and keep my mindset in the correct place. I appreciate the classes opening up, although they are small with Social distancing. Thank you for giving us what we need. Still happy the classes are open again. Can you program the app so it will send us a confirmation or the ability to put an automatic reminder in our calendar. Thanks much. Continue to be pleased and thankful for the app and reopening of studios. It is such a help. Thank you. Thanks for the app. I use it constantly and would be lost without it. Very pleased with the app. Thanks.

----------------------------------------------------------
I love ww and this app is like my daily diary, tracking device, and opportunity to share with members across the country struggling with similar issues. I even track my sleep daily, which helps me organize my life for better weight loss results. Love the recipe suggestions, articles on health and weight loss, advice from members and coaches. It‚Äôs simply the best recent addition to the new ww plan! Oh, headspace offers us additional self help methods of relaxation, and calm for better living conditions especially now while we still deal with covid restrictions. I am totally connected to like minded weight loss members and coaches who give the best support and encouragement during these tenuously crazy times. I was able to continue meetings all through the pandemic by staying virtually connected through this app. For me, it has been a real life saver. Very important part of survival and thriving!

Title: My review
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is one of the greatest things ever. It is by far, the most easiest. And affective way for me to slowly and safely, lose weight. I would recommend this to anybody who is struggling with dieting. Which is what I‚Äôve been doing. Plus what I would like to know is. I have been saving all my points that I receive for merchandise. I haven‚Äôt bought nothing yet but could we have the option after my one year membership is up can we use those points to knock a percentage of my renewal membership for another year. I believe I paid around $130. It would be pretty nice to knock off that $30 when I buy my next year membership. I don‚Äôt plan on getting a month or six months I love this app so much I will be paying for a another full year so could I have the option to do that with my points instead of buying some cups or something. Thank you weight watchers.  .................Devin Elwartoski

Title: The app is good but not perfect
----------------------------------------------------------
I love Connect.  I also like the fact that we can scan foods.  But there needs to be the ability to have our food journal information exported to employer sponsored health apps! For example, I work for Boeing.  Boeing endorses Weight Watchers by having a Boeing discount for Weight Watchers.  Also some Boeing locations have Weight Watchers at work.  Also Boeing wants its employees use a health app called JIFF.  JIFF wants us to track healthy habits like steps.  So my Apple Health app sends my steps to both JIFF and WW.  But JIFF wants my food tracking information.  I should not have to use MyFitnessPal, which exports its food journal entries to JIFF, when I am already tracking on WW!  The reason I am using JIFF is that Boeing gives rewards for consistently practicing healthy habits.  Other employers use JIFF also! Please work with JIFF to make this happen!  Thanks!  Marshall Dunston

Title: Best food tracking/exercise tracking/all of the above app I‚Äôve ever used!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve tried plenty of calorie/meal tracking apps in the past. I‚Äôve tried calorie/food tracking, exercise tracking combo apps in the past as well. After about a week it‚Äôs always too difficult, overwhelming, just not simple and user friendly and I‚Äôd stop using them. I started using the WW app over 6 months ago and it‚Äôs amazing. I‚Äôm still losing weight, 33 lbs lost at this point, and the app is still super easy. I don‚Äôt worry about calories, I just stay in my point budget. I scan barcodes. I have hundreds and hundreds of options when it comes to exercises that the app offers. My Fitbit is synced with the app, so when I go on a run, or clean my house, my active points are all counted! When I go out to eat, I use the app to find a meal within my point budget. Yes, it costs a little $ a month, but it‚Äôs worth it because it actually works, unlike all the other free apps I‚Äôve tried before.

Title: Making a Healthy Lifestyle Easy
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been a member of WW for over 30 years. The trick I found is to keep using it! The times that I haven‚Äôt followed the program over the years have been the times when I‚Äôve had weight difficulties. The most incredible support from WW is allowing members at lifetime wait to have access to the WW tools at no cost. I feel that the years I have had to pay a monthly fee due to my neglect to track and exercise on a regular basis is one of the best motivators to keep on the track of a healthy lifestyle. The tools in this app are absolutely amazing! I love the FitOn short exercise routines. It doesn‚Äôt seem overwhelming to do a 10 to 20 minute workout and there are so many to choose from! The access to deliciously healthy recipes is also a major plus on the app. There are mindful meditations and access for coaching as well. This app has just improved SO much over the years. Thank you WW!

Title: App riddled with issues
----------------------------------------------------------
I love weight watchers. Although the iPhone app is discouraging because it is riddle with inconsistencies. Weekly points reflect the weekly changes on Monday the same as they are for your most recent date. Example if I start with 43 weekly points I‚Äôd like to see that Change in Tuesday if I got over by 2. Monday weekly should show 42 and Riley‚Äôs day should reflect 40.  Instead it shows 40 for both. It doesn‚Äôt let you see easily which days you were impacting those numbers. It doesn‚Äôt always do the math right when you move back and track thru the days. I track my meals every single day and it doesn‚Äôt record the streak. Today I woke up and saw it mark Saturday as a day I missed for tracking despite all meals inputted and reflecting point changes.     I would suggest Weight Watchers work on their site so that it keeps people interested in the tracking. Otherwise it really frustrates.

Title: Tracking
----------------------------------------------------------
The app not only helps me stay motivated with the many workout videos as well as ideas for using your points. That said, my absolute favorite is the tracking. I credit my weight loss due to this fabulous app. It‚Äôs easy to fall off track and to not recall some of the things you may have eaten throughout the day but with the tracker you can look back and be reminded of what you had to eat a d how many points you have left for the day. I swear by using the tracker. I plan my meals in advance and save my weekly‚Äôs if I have a special occasion coming up. All in all, I love everything about WW‚Äôs App. It should go without mention that the Chat room is amazing. You never have to wait and my questions as well as suggestions have always worked . WW has an outstanding group of people to represent them. A team that deserve‚Äôs the very best of recognition. Thank you fir your time, God Bless

Title: Exceptional App!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am so excited about the WW App!  I‚Äôve lost 55 pounds now on WW. The tracking very easy to do for everything!  I love recipes that are offered on the app.  For the last 7 weeks I have been exercising. It was a slow start, I began riding my bike farther and farther, I then found The medium intensity walk/run on the WW app, and I began using it while riding my bike. It is short intervals of intensity and they coach you through it. It‚Äôs 30 minutes, it has made me stronger and faster.  I am now riding 12 miles a day (6 days a week). using the 30 minute walk/app twice during that. I‚Äôm 62 years old and have another 50 pounds to lose, and when I bought the bike in august, I could hardly get on it.  The app is wonderful.  I‚Äôm also using the Aaptiv cardio clips, as well. Looking forward to these when we start traveling for the summer in a few weeks!  Great App - Love It!!!   Debbie H

Title: Throw every other weight loss app away!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am serious here, folks. I FINALLY got my obese self (100 lbs overweight, for crying out loud!) to a local weight watchers group a week ago. I have adhered strictly to all the tips, suggestions, points per food, and other great parts of the program and I weighed in this morning: 5.8 pounds down in just one week! I was not hungry at any time during the week, thanks to the tasty 0 point foods that you can eat whenever. This app is great because it makes everything so easy to keep track of everything you need to keep track of. It has an great data base of foods  and it helps you create meals that are individualized for you and you can use regular food from a grocery store for any and all meals. So there, you have no excuse for not getting your overweight self to Weight Watchers and signing up for the program. Do it as if your life depended on it because, guess what? It does!!

Title: Milestones
----------------------------------------------------------
I am giving this 3 stars just because of the milestones. I accidentally put the wrong weight in, actually I put the weight in but my phone did not put the first number so it said I weighed 4#s or something like that. So, it gave me all kinds of milestones that I did not earn. Even after I fixed it later that day. It has been a few months now and they are still there. Customer service says that they are triggered by your weight you put in and there is nothing they can do. I think if that is true then it should take them away if you put a higher weight in. I like seeing when I got my milestones, but with this issue I don't get them because they are already there. Please fix this. There are people saying they start over on WW and there old milestones are still there so they don't get new ones. other than this issue it would be a five star app. Please fix issue. Thank you.

Title: Weight Loss Game Changer
----------------------------------------------------------
I had never had anything so seamlessly integrate with my life and be so easy for weight loss. I‚Äôm a younger millennial, so I am pretty comfortable with technology, this app is very intuitive for me and because of that it is just a part of my day to day and doesn‚Äôt slow me down at all to use it or even in the early weeks of using it. The bar scanner is used every day for the last 6 months of my journey and it‚Äôs been integral in how easy it to so save foods. I love saving a meal and adding a name with emojis to make them fun to look at. Being able to plan my meal out by tracking ahead is so comforting, this is the best meal planning app as well as weight loss app, attached to this wonderful program. Everything about this app is so great and makes my experience more engaging and easier on my lifestyle! I love this app so much and it‚Äôs made my journey so shockingly easy.

Title: New plan works better then ever!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve tried WW in the past, like 20 yrs. ago, but got turned off with the weighing and measuring your foods. I do understand portion control matters but when you have a very busy lifestyle it‚Äôs too much work. I own a bakery business and now more then ever I‚Äôm super busy. I have customers and friends that have joined and are doing great with the new plan and phone app. They come into my bakery and eat big pieces of cake and sweets and still continue to lose weight! I think it fantastic! It‚Äôs also so affordable for anyone to join. Because I‚Äôm around Cake and sweets all the time, I very rarely, almost never eat it. I prefer bread & pasta, that‚Äôs my weakness.      It‚Äôs only been my 3rd day and I‚Äôve lost 2.5 lbs. already. My goal is to lose 30lbs. Weight Watchers has put control into the palm of my hand with this new app. and and I have no doubt that I‚Äôll reach my goal.

Title: Great app for great program
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve heard of Weight Watchers for several years now but just didn‚Äôt realize how beneficial it would be for me. I thought the program was just for losing weight but turns out it‚Äôs really helpful for just learning how to eat better. In fact, it almost becomes kinda like a game... you have this many points; how do you choose to spend them? If you *really* love that food that you know you shouldn‚Äôt, then just eat really super healthy all day long before you splurge on that one meal. Or, if you don‚Äôt want to use up all your points at once, and don‚Äôt want to eat super healthy the entire day, then you can choose to spend some points at each meal. Maybe you want bacon with your eggs and chips with your sandwich... you can do that as long as it is all in moderation. You don‚Äôt have to give up your favorite foods completely... as long as you eat well overall. I love that.

FOR ME-writing down points and looking things up didn't help. Took too long. This app is the best thing to ever happen to weight watchers! I can look things up fast, compare restaurants (menu), and the best thing is it keeps TRACK of my points. All you do is click on your food and it shows you portion (you control how much-if you only ate a piece of something you can adjust the portion) more importantly-how much is a portion! That, my friend is the key! I am not "tech"savvy. In fact, I called weight watchers and they walked me through everything. Also, be nice to yourself. It took me a few tries to get the hang if it, but it is user friendly. If I made a mistake-you can delete things and then add others. Even the day after! Even keeps track if your activities! So easy! I am back on track after gaining weight during COVID and the app is my guide. Very happy üòÉ.

Title: Losing Sensibly
----------------------------------------------------------
At 66, I found myself the heaviest I have ever been.  Gave all my nice clothes away because I figured I would never fit into it again.  Hated to buy clothes, nothing seemed to fit. Found myself buying XXL in tops to hide the bulges and 16 in pants muffin top. Joined Weight Watchers June 6, 2019, and have lost a total of 46# to date.  Am now buying Medium in dresses and tops and size 8 in pants.  It is the easiest and least expensive way to lose weight, makes you more aware of what you are consuming & so much easier to be able to eat out without going overboard. Don‚Äôt throw your money away on other diets that may help you lose weight fast, only to gain it back just as fast. I have a better outlook on life and am much happier with myself now than I have ever been. Plan on remaining on this eating pattern the rest of my life. Thank you for making it so easy!!

Title: I love WW and the app
----------------------------------------------------------
I am enjoying all the new & wonderful additions, workouts, yoga, meditation, featured articles, and programming. This is especially true for the mindset, exercise and meditation guides. It just gets better and better. I‚Äôve continue to take advantage of Blue Apron recipes that are already in the app. I am starting to do challenges in the exercise areas of the app. These are all excellent features and I‚Äôm using them every day! WW is truly the best comprehensive, healthy lifestyle, weight loss and weight maintenance program to guide its members and to address not only our weight challenges, WW provides us with the tools and approaches to improve our overall health and our lives. The friendships I‚Äôve made and community I‚Äôve enjoyed, and continue to develop have grown over the years and are truly extra special. Thank you always WW! Cheryl McAfee Lifetime Member

Title: Great tool and support system!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app offers a quick, convenient way to track your food/SP's. Offers recipes, restaurants with their SP to help you with tracking. All you have to do is be patient and kind with yourself on the journey to mindful eating. It's no longer a diet, it's geared to a more healthful way of eating, sprinkled with your favorites without the guilt. I made goal and lifetime this time. Program is awesome. The connect group is very helpful in showing you that you are not alone, and when you find your clan, it makes for a fun experience. There are people of all shapes and sizes, people of the gab, people to the point and many in between to read. Something for everyone to pull a great experience to help you with your journey. Come on board, share your thoughts, or just read other's thoughts. It's what you feel comfortable with. See you on connect site. lniles2016.

Title: Very helpful!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve followed the WW program several times over the years and it always works! But I find it sooo much easier now to track my meals and activity and find healthy, delicious recipes with the WW app! I also regularly use the activity portion for FitOn workouts and just started using Aaptiv audios for walks. Connect is a great way to get encouragement from others going through similar things on their journey, plus inspiration to keep going. There are only a few things I‚Äôd love to see added to the app to make it perfect for me, I would like to have a place to keep daily brief notes of things I feel are affecting my weight loss like stress, hormones, illness, etc, as well as user reviews for recipes. Other than that, this app is an AMAZING tool for my weight loss and maintenance journey! I‚Äôve lost 50lbs since joint and have maintained it for a year now.

Title: The App Really Works Well
----------------------------------------------------------
A year ago, I wrote a review on the old app, which was not good. Since then , WW had dramatically improved the app. I pay for monthly membership and with the app, I can track ANY food at ANY restaurant 24/7. Because it's on my phone ,it's like having my own consultant all the time . Also fitness can be tracked . The best part? I can access - within the app - on my phone - a community with real people doing the same thing I am and get support and ideas in real time . I go there for menu inspiration , emotional support and to look at all the before / after and "in progress" pics. I can also instantly access "24/7 Support" for a WW consultant . I don't go to in person meetings, and this app keeps me on track big time. If I unexpectedly go out to eat, I look up my desired menu items on my WW before I order so I stay in control . Really great app.

Title: App
----------------------------------------------------------
The app is the best! It‚Äôs super easy to use and has just about everything I need. It‚Äôs my best buddy! I love the positive reinforcement. It gives me a lift and encourages me to keep it up. There is so much on the app that it can be overwhelming. It‚Äôs nice that you can use the parts you like and ignore the rest until you‚Äôre ready for them. Staying home has given me more time to explore the app and I‚Äôve discovered some pretty cool features. My favorite is the activity feature. I would love a feature that would allow me to build a recipe from one that I already built and save it as a new one. This option exists when modifying an existing WW recipe. I would like to modify my own recipes without having to enter everything again. That way I‚Äôll have an easy way to have both recipes ready to track depending on ingredients I happen to have on hand.

Title: Food choices
----------------------------------------------------------
I am 71 an have been on many of the other programs to help loose weight. I have lost weight much faster on the other programs but have gained it right back just as fast. I am loosing weight much slower but have a greater variety of foods to eat. Since I am a diabetic it has help lower my A1c from 8.4 to 6.4 which is great. My only problem is that you spend a lot of time creating what to eat each day with the points allowed you. Because of that I can eat all of my point just for breakfasts, because that is my favorite meal and have hardly no points left. Also being on this program has help me to realize that I am carbohydrate addicted. I loose less weight and my sugar levels increase. Anyway I am trying to tell you something I can‚Äôt seem to write at the moment. GREAT JOB WEIGHT WATCHERS, this will be my lifesaver program for the rest of my

Title: Great app helps me cut down grazing
----------------------------------------------------------
Very nice app! As a life timer I still struggle with consistency on program. When my weight goes up only way I can get back in control is tracking. Five pounds up right now. Love the recipes, Connect, informational articles, and the ability to save frequent meals or favorite foods. I would love an update to give ability to quickly copy foods or meals eaten within the last week, without first saving as favorites. I would also like to see sample menus. Love recipe builder. Especially appreciate that the app is totally free to Life timers within 2 pounds of goal weight. The current plan is tougher for me given the focus on less sugar, though good for my health. I have a harder time staying within the allotted points than with former plans. But I am constantly working towards less sugar and the support from the app and meetings are great!

Title: Finally, I can lose weight and not feel hungry!
----------------------------------------------------------
In the past, I had used apps like MyFitnessPal that do a great job of tracking calories. I would faithfully track the calories while I gained weight. By contrast, the WW app counts points, not calories. This app enables me to eat a lot and lose weight! I went from eating cereal and milk for breakfast to eating plain Greek yogurt with fresh fruit. For lunch I would eat cut up chicken breast in low point soup. At the grocery store, the app‚Äôs barcode reader would let me (actually my wife) scan sauces on the shelf to find the ones that were zero or low points, i. e., those that did not have added sugar. With the help of this app I had lost 18 pounds in two months and was on lifetime six weeks later. I have continued to eat a low-carb diet and have lost 33 pounds, which is Closer to an ideal weight even though that is below my goal weight.

Title: WW App
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm totally in love with the Weight Watchers app! I‚Äôve been on WW program before and it has always been a beautiful genuine staple for me. It enables me to recognize how I can take charge of my eating habits without feeling restricted to certain foods. The app has also become a great tool for a lot of other incentives such as other group members who share and 24/7 coaching. The app is FILLED with awesome tools and it‚Äôs an endless resource to get yourself in positive mind body and spirit! I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a healthier lifestyle! One of my favorite things about the app is the bar scanner which I use all the time in stores for shopping !! I also love the way it tracks my points!! I never feel that I‚Äôm hungry on this beautiful journey and the recipes and incentives to create new foods are delicious!!

Title: WW App
----------------------------------------------------------
Over the years I have used the Weight Watchers program with initial success, and then the tracking and calculating would become too arduous. Eventually, I‚Äôd go back to my old habits and the weight would come back on, plus. I joined WW again in June. I was the heaviest I‚Äôd had ever been, pregnancies included. I hadn‚Äôt heard of the new app, but was ready to work the program again. At 65, I knew I had a long road ahead of me. Then I used the new app! It has truly changed my life! The app makes it very easy to track, calculate points and best of all the information is at my fingertips! No more hunting for my tracking book, adding and re-adding to be sure my totals are correct. With the app, there is only success ahead of me! I have lost 30 pounds to date.  I hope to reach my goal weight by the beginning of the new year! Thank you WW!

Title: My Lifepreserver
----------------------------------------------------------
I can‚Äôt say I use the app every day. I wish I could. But the truth is I am overjoyed that all the help I need to get back or stay on track is at my fingertips. I love having the fast food info here when I need it as I eat on the go a lot. Also finding calorie counts is a big help. As a life timer I‚Äôve watched the program from the onset and it has grown both in size  and benefits. When I get off track, which is often the case, I know WW is right here to help me get back on program again and in addition to weighing in I have recipes, a place to store my history, chatting, my Fitbit and now, almost too good to be true, a choice of programs (I‚Äôm sticking with Blue).  All these available features are why I call WW and my WW App my lifepreserver. I‚Äôm an active 80-year-old modern woman staying strong and motivated daily by my WW Family.

Title: Use the app.  Drop the weight.
----------------------------------------------------------
After many years of slowly seeing my weight increase, I hit a record high of 220 lbs.  I knew I needed to do something.  After our beach vacation, I dropped 5 lbs. on my own, but knew I needed help to make a significant & permanent change to counteract many years of bad eating habits.  I started on July 6th, and as of today, I have lost 41 pounds.  I want to lose 4 more pounds before Thanksgiving .  The app has helped me eat right, make good food choices, and learn portion control.  As a Catholic, I also have taken to abstaining from meat on Wednesday‚Äôs & Fridays and fasting on certain days.  The app has helped me with this as well.  Praise be to God! The app has been extremely helpful when eating out and identifying good and bad choices.  Get the app.  Commit yourself.  Lose the weight.  Thanks, Weight Watchers!  Pax et bonum!

Title: This  WW. Is Incredible üéâ
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been enrolled in WW for many years and I am a lifetime member who began this journey again after 30 yrs. My life is aimed at wholistic views and I have evolved from the old program , fit points in the beginning, and now. As you get older it seems easier to gain weight, become sedentary , not being as social as before and generally paying mor attention to your illnesses than the causes that are contributing to your health. A year ago we decided to take the plunge back to WW. What a blessing this has been. We have lost 95lbs together ( of course the man üë® lost 50lbs and the woman üë© 45lbs.) and have been there since around the end of Oct 2019. The program is exciting, our leader is Awesome, and the new plan with three levels make it very  accommodating for all. Thank you for such a great lifetime journey! I am impressed!!

----------------------------------------------------------
I like this app because I can record my food and keep track of what I‚Äôm eating and plan for future meals. I also like How I can look up food to see how many points they‚Äôre worth. It makes it much easier to continuously stay on this plan. I like that you can talk to others on the plan and that WW communicates with you continuously by giving facts, meals and various information. I also like that you can continuously keep track of your weight loss by entering the weight loss numbers in the program and seeing a graph of weight loss. Weight watchers makes it incredibly easy to stay on the plan and to plan for eating out, as well! I also love that you have so many restaurant items too. And, I am glad of that because I am shocked to see how many points are in restaurant foods! I can plan before I eat out and that‚Äôs important to me.

Title: Weight Watchers is Life Changing!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I began my weight loss journey nearly 3 years ago, but being in my 60‚Äôs found progress to be slow and frustrating. I researched the best weight loss programs, and WW always came out on top. Before I began WW, I had lost only 16 pounds in over 2 years. I have been using the weight watcher app for 7 months now and have lost 12 pounds. The app is easy to use; the point system is easy to follow; the sleep and exercise systems are extremely beneficial; and the encouragement they give you is motivating. I absolutely LOVE the app and program and highly recommend it to anyone needing to lose weight. My eating habits have changed dramatically for the better, as has my exercise and sleep habits. I also love the recipe suggestions and the WW snacks. The weekly weigh in and goal setting is a huge help, too. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT!!!

----------------------------------------------------------
This app is incredible! Not only does it help keep me on track points-wise, it is full of recipes, inspiration, and motivation. You can plan your meals for the week. You can find amazing recipes and exercises. I love the live and in demand coaching. And the fact that you can connect with others. I am truly impressed with this app. It has everything I need to succeed in my wellness goals. The new WW plans are fantastic. I did weight watchers years ago, and was successful with it. Over the years I got out of my good habits and I found myself here again. I had forgotten about how supportive and educational weight watchers is. I am learning to eat the foods I love again, while still working towards my wellness goals. There are so many options and inspired recipes on this app. This is something I can stick with. Nice work, WW.

Title: I wish connect work on my laptop!
----------------------------------------------------------
The tools on my phone are incredible! I have been using more and more of the activity apps that are included, the challenges that are on connect, and scanning foods as well as entering them in my food journal. The only thing that just really grabs me, that I can‚Äôt believe has not been addressed yet, is that I cannot do any of the connect things on my laptop. I cannot post anything, I cannot look up any of the people that I want to follow!!! It just seems incredible to me that this has not been addressed and corrected yet. I know I am not the only one to say this. I am not one of those who is fluent in texting, and I like the big numbers that I can use on my laptop with my hand in a keyboard position. I find that I would write more, and use connect more, if I did not have to punch all the teeny little letters on my phone.

----------------------------------------------------------
I love the WW plan. I‚Äôve never been on a diet and I‚Äôm 59 years old. My daughter joined and I got curious about WW. I kept asking questions about it after she shared her experience with the points and eating and the quick results. I‚Äôve put on some pounds and combined with not knowing how to eat completely healthy and portion control WW has taught me this in a very short time. I use the WW recipes exclusively to plan my three daily meals. I joined January 21st 2019 and as of today March 17, 2019 I have lost 13 pounds. I love all facets of the app. Tracking my weight, recipes, bloggers, and scanning foods before I buy them in order to decide if it‚Äôs smart to purchase and of course ingest. I am an example to my family, friends and coworkers. Thank you for the WW plan and the ease of using the WW app. You‚Äôve one me over 100%.

Title: The App
----------------------------------------------------------
After many years in WW, and only one year of concerted effort to use the app, I am pleased. BUT: it takes way too long to scroll through all the options to get to the important stuff for me: recipes and then to find the one that I am tracking. Too much junk in between. And I mean distractors: all of the different things that they want you to try and use. No wonder the attention span of humans is getting shorter and shorter. How about a ‚Äúmemory‚Äù link to take you immediately to the thing that you use the most often, after one has successfully done that, a choice, ‚Äúbefore you go...‚Äù. For me: food, recipes, activity. That feature is present in activity by the way. I usually do the treadmill, so, it pops up. But tracking food, crazy how long it takes me to find my food. Otherwise, the app is finally starting to work for me.

Title: It really works!!
----------------------------------------------------------
10 MONTHS IN AND DOWN 78LBS!!! I have tried so many different things over the years to try to lose weight and become healthier. Expensive pills, powders and patches that promise results that were never achieved. Extreme diets that although they did get fast results, the results didn‚Äôt last. Weight Watchers hasn‚Äôt just helped me lose weight it has literally changed my relationship with food! I have learned the importance of moderation, of what I am actually putting into my body and how to eat without feeling deprived of anything! I have learned that I can indulge my cravings without going overboard because I have denied myself too much for too long like is required with so many other diets and programs. In short this is truly a manageable way to eat healthy for life and still have all of the things that make you happy!

Title: Best weight loss plan ever
----------------------------------------------------------
It really works. During COVID lock down I was laid off and got depressed. I ate a lot. I gained a lot of weight too. I have always struggled with the weight issue as a lot of people do. When I finally decided it was time to do something real about it I weighed myself. 355 lbs. OMG. So I needed a plan. My wife had tried weight watchers before and had some great success.  I however did not want to go to meets or have anyone telling me what to do. The app was the perfect solution for me. I was accountable only to myself and no meetings to attend. Super easy and kinda made life into a video game when it comes to eating. My family and I all use the app and I‚Äôm happy to report that in 3 months I‚Äôm down 50 pounds and still losing weight. I feel much better and have more energy. Get this app. It is well worth the monthly fee.

Can‚Äôt get the weight typed in and all the sudden it is off and running! Doesn‚Äôt show the current date I am on either.

WW is the best program out there for working and Caring about your wellness!  Don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without them. I‚Äôm a senior citizen and the pounds come off slowly but they do come off. Years ago I started WW and have went through some bad times resulting in the Loss of my husband. But I always knew WW was at my back. After my husband passed and I was able to go back to the meetings (workshops), I experienced the most wonderful ‚Äúwelcome back‚Äù. I attribute that to my wonderful leader and the group I belong to on Monday evenings. I started at 230 pounds and am now down to 188 lbs. it‚Äôs been a great journey and I have learned so much about a healthy eating style and way of living. God bless this organization and all the people who work so hard to help people through losing pounds and, sometimes, a difficult journey.

Title: Best app, user friendly, highly recommend!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love the app! I use it for tracking every day. The scanner is easy to use and is almost always right. To be sure you can compare nutritional information on the bottom. You can easily create you own foods from the calculator, create recipes, save your favorite meals, swipe-to-track, create smart phrases with Siri if you use iOS, find awesome recipes, scroll connect... ENDLESS! I started as an online WW user in July 2018 but joined meetings in August 2018 and I do not understand how anyone could not like this app. I usually stay after to help those struggling in my workshop. If you don‚Äôt like this app, please, ask someone who can help you or attend a workshop because this app really has helped me lose 75 pounds already and I can‚Äôt see myself stopping anytime soon because of the ease and usability of this app! üôåüèΩü§©üëèüèΩ
