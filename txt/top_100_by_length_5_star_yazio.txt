Title: THE BEST (not biased I stg)
----------------------------------------------------------
I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but I am truly impressed by this app and felt I should give credit where credit is due. This is by far the best diet aid app I have found and I‚Äôve been through many trying to find the perfect one. It has everything you need all in one and there‚Äôs no hidden charges like others. What I especially like about this app is their extensive recipes, one thing I struggle with as an athlete is getting enough, good, calories and the recipes have helped tremendously as they are all light wholesome ingredients (perfect for an active lifestyle). Another great aspect is their new addition for notes so that way you can track how you are feeling if you are in a new diet or if you just want to decompress. There are so many meal plan options so you can choose what is right for you or just track what you are already doing!:) facts

Title: Life changer
----------------------------------------------------------
I started this app as a slim 17 year old kid getting ready to go to college. My goal has always been to play lacrosse at Syracuse and this app is helping me immensely. I set my goal to building muscle as I started as an athletic but still somewhat scrawny kid. I started at 135 and set my goal weight for 155 to start. With the help of this app, I have been able to get the proper amount of calories I need for my goal AND I get a step counter and calories burned counter. This app does all the math for me and I am no longer struggling with my calorie counting like I was before this app. In 2 weeks I have gained almost 6 pounds of almost 100% pure muscle. This app has made it easy to meet daily goals with reminders and helpful tools throughout the app. The recipe ideas are also helpful even if you don‚Äôt have the pro membership.

Title: Great app, BUT....
----------------------------------------------------------
I've downloaded and tested several food tracking apps and this was by far my favorite for someone who tracks macros and weighs their food out in grams.  The only issue I've noticed is that when setting goals for carbs, protein and fat, the amounts do not equal up to the calorie amount intended and you can't fix it because according to the app it doesn't equal 100% but it actually does.  For example my carbs are set to 192g which is 768 calories (4calories per gram) but that app displays that as being 785 calories.  Another thing is I wish that you were able to revise a food that you create. If you enter the incorrect information accidentally and complete the added food you can't go in to edit your mistake, you have to create a new item.

Title: I love this for the most part........
----------------------------------------------------------
I recently started using this app and so far I love it BUT! I don‚Äôt understand the point of the app asking for a unit when creating a food for the database, (such as ml, gram, etc) if it‚Äôs still not going to allow me to document my food by that unit. For example, I added a product to the database and wanted to document it in the diary by a ml measurement. Even though I selected ml as a standard unit it still gives me oz when it comes tine to journal how much of the product I ate. PLEASE give us more options for measuring the food please! I prefer to measure most things by gram since I believe it‚Äôs the most accurate. Or maybe I‚Äôm missing something? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü•¥

Title: Need a little more
----------------------------------------------------------
I love the app so much so I use it everyday compare to other nutrition app on my phone. The only problem I have is creating a meal is hard for me. So I tried putting in okra soup but the only option I had was Nigerian okra soup. Am African yes but not Nigerian so the way my country okra soup is made is very different from Nigerian Okra soup. There was an option to creating your meal by adding things in but is so difficult to manage I had to settle for the option of Nigerian Okra soup which gave me more calories than I had actually consumed. Besides this great app I would recommend it 100 times more than any nutrition app on my phone. Great Job Team YAZIO

Title: Works great with my new Apple Watch
----------------------------------------------------------
I was very pleased to find this premium version of the YAZIO app at a great price! Only $20 a year! I found out after years on weight watchers and trying Noom $20 a month! Thankfully, that there‚Äôs this better and more affordable diet diary type app. I was particularly interested in fasting  support apps and being able to speak into the Apple Watch to track my meals on the go. It synchronizes exercise and calories perfectly. Really enjoying YAZIO at this point in time, I have been able to lose the 5lbs I gained through Thanksgiving and Christmas. I hope to be at my goal weight before my birthday in June.  I‚Äôll update

Title: Awesome way to lose weight!
----------------------------------------------------------
So with the Covid and quarantine, my weight started inching upward.  While reading Covid info, obesity and diabetes are common factors for this virus.   I am only 70 and decided it was a perfect time to take control of my weight.  YAZIO is amazing and easy to use.  Simply track those calories, found in the app‚Äôs simple food directory.  And YAZIO is linked to your exercise/health app.  I‚Äôm doing this for free, but you can pay for other services on this app, like recipes and more.  I‚Äôve lost 17 lbs. and my goal is 25.  Almost there.  I feel great!

Title: Nice calorie, nutrition counter for free
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve used other weight loss apps before, expensive ... especially if you‚Äôre at goal and have a good grip on foods that keep you in you daily calorie range. My only complaint is the actual documentation of food... serving sizes don‚Äôt jive, should have more options, and many of the calories are wrong so I need to fumble with grams to get to the known calorie count. I‚Äôve gained 5 lbs after loosing 115, I‚Äôm not going to let it creep up, this is great to get me back on the proper way to eat. Thank you for this free app !!

----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app.üíó  It‚Äôs a way for me to count my calories and stay on track.  If I want to have a heavy meal, I wait to do that on my exercise days .  The more you exercise, your body continue to burn calories during the day.   This app accounts for that.  Another added feature is that it have just about every food listed that you will need to keep track of those calories.  You can also scan any barcode to see if it‚Äôs available on the list.

I love this app! (Btw I didn‚Äôt get the pro) I have always had trouble drinking water. I would go days without drinking anything. But with the water tracker, it made me drink 64 fl oz a day! I also love that I can track my calorie, fat, carb, and protein intake. If you are trying to keep track of calories,  carbs etc, I definitely recommend this app. And the best part is that everything that I‚Äôve said IS FREE!

----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm not going to rely on the calorie/fat/carbs/sugar totals put in by other users. I went to enter my Dutch Bros coffee this morning (had a large carmelizer, yumm!) and when I put in how many ounces it was and came up with over 2,000 calories!!! Ok I looked it up online, a 20oz is 510 calories. I recognize that many of these are created by other users but come on! That made me freak out at first!

I‚Äôm recovering from an eating disorder and this app has helped me feel more secure that I‚Äôm eating exactly what my body needs.

Now I‚Äôm getting enough protein and fats and I‚Äôm the healthiest I‚Äôve been in years! Thank you so much! I‚Äôve recommended this app to all my friends.

This app is so good, it‚Äôs almost perfect. It has nutrition, activity, water, and measurement tracking, plus a notes section with a good variety of tags that serve as a mood journal/symptom tracker of sorts. With pro, I also have Fitbit integration and a fasting tracker. Put that all together and this app really meets all of my needs and took 2-3 apps out of my rotation, all replaced by this one.

----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm pleased to say that now that the app. has been around for some time, all the bugs are worked out and it works very well. A little slow to update across my iPhone and Apple Watch, but it does eventually. I like setting up favorite foods and then I can track my calories. It has made me better at portion control too as the app. requires that you kinda know the approx. weight (oz.) of foods.

I like the app look and organization and it has been working great for me.  I like the option to build a meal so you don't have to select individual items each time.  But I really hate how it doesn't allow you to set a serving size for it to default to that makes sense.  Also need to have an option to measure in cups, Tablespoons, etc.  That's why I took a star off.

It takes a little while to get used to (~2 weeks), but awesome and super useful for having a better count of what you‚Äôre consuming. I‚Äôve made progress towards my goal weight after two weeks, and feel good about it. Getting used to it can be frustrating, but totally worth it. Could use a larger and better organized dictionary of food to choose from.

The bright colors, easy to use tracking, and ability to sync to my Apple Watch for FREE are just a few of the reasons I won‚Äôt use any other app. I‚Äôve lost 10 lbs in 6 weeks using the meals and the calorie counter. Great app!

Title: Excellent with robust Health Kit integration
----------------------------------------------------------
One of the reasons I downloaded and became a pro subscriber for this apps is because of the amount of integration with HealthKit.  But there is some stuff missing mine BMI. I hope the developers add that in a future update.
