Title: A wellness tracker that actually stands out from the rest.
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve seen and used many different wellness trackers during my time trying to meet a healthy weight. And all of these apps are great. They do there job and I have nothing to complain about. However, I never stick with any wellness apps because they are too good, and therefore, overly complicated. This is the pet where this app comes in. It’s dead simple to use which keeps me coming back to log my food intake. As long as you have a scale to weigh the food your eating, this simple app makes the chore of logging macros into kinda a  game in a way. When I wake up I genuinely want to weigh my food and log it into the app because it’s very accurate, very thorough, and very effective. But finding all that in an app that is as simple as this one is hard to find. The app even automatically tally’s all of your calories for the day and differentiates the macros. This way in a matter of a second you can figure out if you met your goal. This app also integrates with restaurants so even if you have to eat out you can still log your calories for the food you order! All in all this app is effective, accurate, it’s fun to use and most importantly, its actually easy to understand and use!

Title: Lots of great features!
----------------------------------------------------------
I initially went looking for Applebee's nutrition information.  I was more than surprised that the information was not listed on the Applebee's website-menu.  I googled "Applebee's nutrional information" and the Nutritionix Track site was one that was listed.  I was amazed to be able to find the exact meal that I had ordered last evening.  This was the information I was seeking.  I was able to download the app to both my iPhone and iPad.  I really appreciate the fact that Nutritionix Track is able to provide the missing piece to my daily meal plan. It's easy to keep track of the the foods eaten at home, but those foods or meals eaten outside the home become a mystery when considering the nutritional facts. At the end of the day, the information utlimately would be incomplete.  i find that we eat out more often than I would like to admit.  The Nutritionix Track app restaurant food search provides that missing piece to complete the daily picture.   I am also very impressed by the scanner box to search for foods, and found that many of my grocery store items are on the food log. The manual entry for items not found on the log was easy to navigate.

Title: Love  It
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used a lot of trackers over the years and this one tops them all. Simple to use.  Let’s you edit freely, copy frequently used foods from previous days, great food search database, ability to enter custom foods, recipes, so versatile. Let’s you enter your goals not only for weight, but for ratio of protein, fat and carbs, a feature I’ve been craving. Tracks these ratios, plus calories and exercise. Shows these in a  usable format as you log throughout the day. Love that you can click on any section, lunch, snacks, and get individual recap of calories, ratios, etc. This let’s you analyze each meal or the whole day. I am just below pre-diabetic so my goal is to up my protein and lower my carb and sugar intake. What a surprise when you can track these and see what you are really eating! This is so motivating and makes me feel in control, giving me the tools I need to manage what I eat and to meet my goals of delicious, easy, healthy eating. I just did a web search for high protein, low carb snacks and found many things I actually like that I can’t wait to log to see how they improve my ratios.  Thank you for this tracker!

Title: Great app!
----------------------------------------------------------
My husband and I track all of our food on paper, and we are pretty close to this app as far as calories go because we have a food scale and weigh everything we put in our mouth. But what we did not have was the percentage of fat, protein and carbs daily. Found it by accident at the bottom of the page where you track your food, and was pleasantly surprised at all the micronutrients they list and have your daily numbers there, impressive! Once we had our main foods in the system it’s pretty easy to add or move from one meal to another. Also love how it calculates your BMR for you. Another feature we love is being able to snap a photo of the bar code and it pulls up the nutritional info with a picture. And if it’s not in their database, they ask you to help them add it by simply taking a few pictures of front and nutrition label, and in 3 days they will try to have it in their database. If you are serious about loosing weight and getting a better grip on your nutrition, this app is GREAT!

Title: LOVE
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve had this app for over 3 years and it’s the best tracking app I’ve found...and it’s free with no paid upgrades! What I love about it is that you can scan foods in with a barcode scanner, you can add your own custom foods or recipes, they have an EXTENSIVE restaurant database, all foods in the app are very accurate (unlike other apps) so you don’t have so guess if whah you’re tracking is accurate or not, the nutritionix team is very fast to respond with any questions or concerns about the app, I’ve emailed support a few times about little bugs and they fix them immediately, it’s super user friendly, it shows you the meal’s whole nutrition and the day’s while nutrition facts, you can see how much you’ve eaten for the day and see how much you have left...I could go on! I am a nutrition and macro coach and I recommend this app to all my clients.

Title: My favorite food tracker
----------------------------------------------------------
I tried multiple food/diet/nutrition apps, including My Fittness Pal, but found this app was easier to use adding individual foods or creating recipes with nutrition macros broken down per serving. Can adjust personal goals for daily amounts of protein, carbs, and fats so it fits a variety of dietary needs— which for me is a low carb, high fat diet to control Type 2 diabetes. It quickly pulls up what I typically eat at certain times of day so I don’t have to go looking to log 2 eggs every morning. LOVE that it’s a free app with so many food nutrition info available (and easily scaled to my serving) or to scan with my phone. Plus tons of restaurants are included.  Easily log exercise and water intake. So many awesome features. Did I mention it’s free? Helps me stay on track and motivated. Thank you for this awesome app!

Title: Only app that has nutrition split for restaurant meals
----------------------------------------------------------
Its the best free calorie counter app and nutrition log so far. I have used so many apps including my plate and atkins, but this is the best. No other app has macros splig and nutrition content for restaurant foods and daily grocery items. Its great that it allows me to set my own daily macro percentage and helps me keep track of the macros. The daily weight log and water intake is a bonus. Most apps give water tracker only for premium users. This app even allows me to create my own food and recipes. It has recommended tab for snacks suggested by dietitian, i don’t use that much though. The only thing this app doesnt have is suggested food recipes, like keto friendly, high protein foods etc. If they include recipes and tips, Nutritionix will be the best!!

Title: This an excellent app
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm updating my review because the one problem I had has been solved.  This app makes it very easy to track caloric intake and see where you are at any time. I love that; it's just what I needed and it keeps me on track.  I also really like the cumulative stats to see how you're doing and how the weight loss progresses over a period of time.  The bar code scanning feature is incredibly handy and that, along with the recipe builder and the custom food feature makes it possible to accurately track everything you're eating.  The cumulative dietary information is an added bonus. I'm a vegetarian and this makes tracking my protein intake simple as well. All in all, this is a terrific and very useful app. Thank you to the developers.

Title: Best tracker EVER
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m of ethnic heritage and grew up eating home cooked from scratch meals. This tracker allows me to enter my recipes. I was later in life diagnosed with a couple of medical conditions which restricted my diet. This tracker is great at monitor my micronutrients in addition to all the usual ones. The bar code scanner option allows me to scan my foods quickly and and easily. I can also speak my food items. If there is a food that is not in their database, it asks to take a picture of front and back, submit it, and the item is added within a day or two. This tracker has enabled me to loose weight and stay healthy. It’s highly customizable. I can not speak high enough about this tracker. Best tracker/companion for food and health!

Title: Love this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried to track my calories many times over the past several years, but I've never been successful until now. I love being able to enter what I ate without scrolling through huge lists of options. I'm also extremely forgetful so the text reminder each night insures I never miss a day. It also auto loads my calorie count onto my Fitbit. AND the customer service can't be beat! One time I entered an item that the program didn't recognize. I wasn't too concerned so I didn't contact them about it. The next day I received a personal email apologizing for the inconvenience and informing me they have now added the item to their database...wow! I can't say enough about how great this app is!

Title: Most comprehensive app
----------------------------------------------------------
The food label for the individual is the best!! Tried other apps but this one is by far the most comprehensive. I’ve shared this app with two others who are using different apps and they switched to Nutritionix. I find the “food” labels most beneficial. In addition to food labels that list the nutrients, a label is created listing the individual’s intake throughout the day. I can check my numbers prior to consuming any food, thereby, making it easier to make healthier choices. The app also tracks exercise and water consumption. Adding foods to the list is easy. It has most of the foods already in its data base. I’ve only had to create (add) one food item and it was very easy to do.

Title: I can't imagine any easier way to do this!
----------------------------------------------------------
So I was looking for a calorie counting app. There are a ton of them. This one was free and looked fairly basic. I have in the past logged all my food and frankly it's a pain. With this it isn't!!! You can just talk to your phone and tell it what you're eating and how much and it figures it out. I've done enough of it to know that it's pretty darn accurate. Nothing helps you keep track of your food intake better than logging your food, but if it's a pain he won't do it. This is so easy!!! This is probably my favorite app of anything on my phone. Wow! The developers knocked it out of the park on this one. Thank you so much!

Title: Updated review: Solid app - still recommended
----------------------------------------------------------
Update:  Still one of the best food tracking apps available. However, the “dietician-approved recommendation” tab is just advertising. There’s no convincing scientific proof to suggest people should be consuming weird supplements from companies that make pseudoscientific claims about their benefits or that they should be downing unnecessary protein supplements. I find this a disappointing move and one that is truly lacking in integrity. There’s so much misinformation on nutrition out there already and the general public is ill-equipped to parse it. This sort of advertising is harmful and ought to be reconsidered.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Rest assured - the Nutritionix app will continue to be a free app. You only need to subscribe to share your diet with a coach.  So if you are not using the Coach Portal sharing feature, then your Track experience is still completely independent of any subscriptions and will remain that way. If you have additional concerns, please don’t hesitate to let us know at support@nutritionix.com so that we can provide further clarity. Thank you!

Title: Great for nursing mom
----------------------------------------------------------
I got this for my skinny new mom daughter, to help her be sure she eats enough to be able to breastfeed her baby. I started tracking for her to see how easy it would be for her to use, and it's working out great! Scanning UPC codes is so helpful. The recipe feature is great, too, for foods she eats regularly, and it works either for a single-serving recipe or multiple-serving one and she can then designate how many servings she eats (worked great for a batch of special cookies). It would be nice to select whether one is trying to gain or lose weight, but for her, she just knows that red is good and green is bad.

Title: Best app!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is better than most nutrition tracking apps!  Better than My Fitness Pal! And it is free! It has a very appealing interface. It offers you calorie intake goal and an option of deciding how many of those will be carbs, how many fats and how many proteins. I can't believe it's free. I imagine it will stop being free one day otherwise how would the developer justify all the work done to develop this beautiful app. I would even pay for it only if it was one time reasonable charge to own it for life instead of monthly payments - like my fitness pal who charges 9.99/month. I'd never pay this much for an app.

Title: This is a great !!!! App!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is so easy. I wondered why my weight was going up when I didn't think I was eating all that wrong. I spent one day keeping a paper diary of what I ate. Than I thought there had to be an app for that. I found this one on day two. It is so easy to log food as I ate it. I quickly found the source of those extra calories. After making immediate adjustments the weight started falling off. This has been the easiest diet I have ever been on. I have used diets advertised on TV and they worked too but this is easier!!  And I eat the foods I like. I just keep the calorie intake in check throughout the day.

Title: User friendly, accurate, effective
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is incredibly easy to use to record food:  type, talk, or scan bar codes for what you have eaten. You can also record servings for your recipes.  Summary stats help you know the nutrition profile of what you are eating, and your weight over time. Food values are also validated and accurate. Recording what I eat gives me immediate feedback about my caloric intake, and makes me aware of the food that I am eating. I must use this app in order to lose weight. When I try to lose weight by “guesstimating” what I am eating at the end of the day, I don’t lose weight. This app works for me.

Title: I Love This App!
----------------------------------------------------------
I discovered this app in mid-August and with its help, I have already lost 5.5 pounds.  Logging your food intake is a tried and true method of losing weight, and this app makes food logging easy and actually kind of fun!  It displays a running total of the calories you have consumed as well as those remaining for the day, along with a tally of carbs, protein, and fat consumed.  Logging can be done either online or via the web app.  This app helps to keep you honest about how much you are eating each day.  Even after I reach my goal, I intend to keep using it to stay at my goal weight.

Title: Truly a 6 Star App!
----------------------------------------------------------
With the help of the Nutritionix I have been able to lose 40+ lbs over the course of 6 months by tracking calories, logging foods, eating smarter and exercising daily. This app has made calorie tracking into a game and the weight loss has been a healthy 1 to 1.5 lbs a week. The interface is simple and clean. 99.9% of the foods I eat are already in the system which is amazing. Adding a food is as simple as a snapping a couple of photos. I recently tried a few other trackers just to see if there was a better choice and they all fell short. They could not compare to Nutritionix!

Title: One small caveat
----------------------------------------------------------
Best nutrition app I’ve seen. Only issue I have is that it will double count nutrition info on my iPhone health app. For example if I eat 2000 calories a day it shows up as 4000 on the health app. I can manually delete the second entry but that can be a pain. It only shows the double counted calories and other nutritional info on the health app, so not a huge issue but if that could be fixed this would be 5 stars all day. Still going to continue to use the app as it’s the best one out there. If you can get back to me on a fix it would be greatly appreciated!!

I’ve been searching for an easy to use, thorough and fun app to use to keep me on track with nutrition, exercise, and water intake. I cannot believe how complete and user friendly Nutritionix is !! It has an extensive database of foods, their nutritional breakdown and micronutrients if you’re into that. I’m primarily concerned with calories, protein, complex carbs and fat. You can easily log your daily meal plans and voila!, you get an accurate and easy to understand our graph, nutritional summary. I cannot tell enough people about this app... Thank you!!

My favorite tracker stoped being supported a while ago so I’ve been trying all the food tracking apps since: free and paid. I really like the Track app. It has a large data base of foods. It’s easy to track and copy foods. The scan and the search both return good results. It’s easy to add a recipe or a custom food. It also allows you to quickly select foods that you eat frequently. You can adjust macro levels and get a break down of macros by day or by meal. Simple with all the right info. I  think I finally found an app to replace my former favorite!

I love this app. I have tried what seems like every tracking app out there and nothing compares to this one. It's so easy to use. It's simple and tracks exactly what I need. The best part is the database full of all the foods. Seriously! When using the other apps there would always be at least two foods per meal that wasn't in the database and I'd have to try and figure out myself to add. This app has just about everything I scan! There have been a couple calorie discrepancies and they were so nice about it. I really like this app and recommend it.

----------------------------------------------------------
I’m a doctor who was trying to follow the advice I give my patients related to tracking sodium intake daily- I was not even following my own advice! I was enlightened when I began nutritionex about how much improvement I needed in my own dietary intake. By tracking what I ate and slowly making improvements I ate better and lost weight - most importantly I was able to get to a healthier place. I don’t endorse products but I share how tracking helped me with my patients and colleagues- and this has helped them too! Great easy product to use!

----------------------------------------------------------
As a long time user of MyFitnessPal, I have to say I finally found a food tracking app to replace it! Logging foods using their natural language technology is a breeze. Last night I went out for Korean food, typed “Bibimbap” into the app, and BOOM it was on my food log. No more scrolling through tons of entries to find the food I am trying to log. But for those that prefer to log very specific brands, this app lets you do that too - it has Nutritionix’s entire database of grocery store products and restaurant foods. This one is a keeper!

----------------------------------------------------------
I never write reviews, but love this app so much I decided I have to. I've used many food/calorie logging apps, and this is by far my favorite. I have yet to find a food it doesn't have in the database, it's easy to add full meals and recipes, you can speak to it instead of type (if you want), it's easy to see total nutrition or macro breakdown for the day, a meal or a single food, etc. Tracking food can be such a pain, this really makes it easier. Only request is to allow us to set macro goals (in addition to calorie goals). Thanks!

Thank you for your feedback, Gretchen! We are thrilled to hear you are enjoying Track. Good news! Our new Macro Goals feature will be released to the mobile app later this summer!

I’ve been using this app for a year. I’ve lost over 60 lbs.   If you log, you will lose. It’s that simple.  I love how this app connects with Alexa. As I make my meal, I call out my food/measurements to Alexa and she records it. How easy is that!  An additional feature I like is entering a whole recipe to determine my per serving calories. Enter it once and done. Next time I call out banana bread to Alexa..she already knows my per gram numbers and calculates accordingly.  This app definitely helps me stay on track. Thank you!

----------------------------------------------------------
This is so easy to use and quick too. I am using it to target a ketogenic diet; where my daily carbohydrates are less than 10%. This app logs the nutrition data from any food you add times the quantity.  They have a library of thousands of name brand or generic foods. So at the end of the day, it gives you a total nutrition summary which is perfect for counting calories, carbs, etc. I adjusted the daily amount of calories to increase it above 2,000 so it doesn't tell me I'm over the limit because I'm trying to gain weight.

Until the last two updates I loved this app!  It had everything that I needed for tracking food intake. The next to last update gave me an app which no longer works on OS 12.3.1 on my iPhone. If I start up the app, I can just sit there and after about 30 seconds, it dies-whether I do anything or not. I was told to just use it on my laptop until they fixed it. After about two weeks there was another update. It does the same thing. Too bad, I really liked it, but on my iPhone it is useless now! I wanted an app for my phone!

I am a Tupe 2 diabetic and I needed to lose some weight. This app has helped me lose ten pounds (still going) by keeping me accountable for what I eat. You can set your calorie intake to  whatever you need. It also tracks activity, water intake and weight if you so choose. There is nutritional information on so many foods. The data base is very large and you can adapt your serving size.This app can be as simple or as detailed as you like. I would recommend this app to anyone that needs some help with tracking food intake.

This app is exactly what I was looking for!  It's so easy to use.  Almost every item I scan is in their system and if not, it gives you the option to add it yourself.  I love that you can see your daily average intake in a pie diagram, as well as percentage. A couple of things would be nice. I'd like to see a weekly average of where I'm at with carbs, carbs broken down (if that's possible), protein, fat, and sodium.  Sodium intake is so important. But, just the way this app stands, it beats all the others I've tried.  :)

It also has a daily summary that actually turns your whole day into one Nutrition Label, and it  breaks down into a pie chart your carbs, protein, etc.  They put a lot of thought into making this App, and it's got so much information on tons of different foods.  I haven't eaten one thing that I wasn't able to find in this App.  Amazing!!!

This is incredibly The best app of all the apps i’ve downloaded. There’s a scanner that inputs all the values on the label saves time not putting the values in yourself.

This stands out why i will keep this app for along while.  it’s free without the upgrade.  it’s nice to see there are worthwhile apps that’s not too good to be true. thanks very much

It's very user friendly, it allows you to adjust serving sizes based on how much was eaten.  You can scan items from your refrigerator and it logs them in directly.  One of the best parts, is that I didn't need to sign up and enter a whole lot of useless information.  I needed an App to strictly count calories.  And this one does it perfectly.  Great job!

Title: App has become my partner!
----------------------------------------------------------
After being so disappointed in other apps my expectations Nutritionix were quite low. I was so thrilled to find how easy to use and how tracking friendly this is.  It allows me to change food combinations for each meal ahead of eating to reach my correct macros.  The foods already listed for inclusion are the foods we buy every day which makes logging fast and correct.  I plan my meals with coffee first thing every morning and rely on this app to balance my macros!  I love this excellent app!

----------------------------------------------------------
I tried several other apps that left me frustrated. As a result, I decided to track using pen and paper which was both time-consuming and cumbersome. During my manual paper tracking, I noticed that I was referring to Nutritionix.com to as a reference for macronutrients for the foods that I was tracking. Through the website I learned about the app that is easy to use, accurate, and provides me with a world of information to track and tweak my goals.  Thank you Nutritionix for this free app!

----------------------------------------------------------
This app is really good at helping me track my food and keeping me on the path of Atkins induction phase. I like the nutrition label it can calculate for your daily intake and I do the math to figure out net carbs. The support team is very responsive to suggestion. If you are looking for an easy way to track  your eating, this is it. Be faithful, log everything, and then you can see an honest picture of your relationship with food and make changes to reclaim a healthy balance with food.

Title: Simple and fun to use
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using this app for a couple weeks and I love how simple it is to understand . The barcode scanner is also a really fun and helpful feature to use. Right now the app only gives recommended daily calorie limits for maintaining current weight and for losing a pound a week but I would like to see an option for gaining weight. I use this app to make sure I'm eating enough throughout the day and I think that an option to set a goal for minimum amount of calories would be helpful.

----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried a few different apps and this one works so much better than loseit, lifesum, etc. You don’t have to pay for it, it’s straight forward, and no fluff. It very easily works with apple’s HealthKit - which was a huge plus because the other ones I’ve tried were lacking in this area. I love the free type section to log meals, it’s so user friendly. I’ve actually stuck with tracking for once and have yet to miss a day. And to boot - there’s no obnoxious ads or pop ups. 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻

I love this app by all means. It makes tracking my Cals, macronutrients extremely easy. I can watch what I eat for a Cut/Bulk and never exceed my allotted daily limit. Even when going out with friends to eat or drink I can watch myself because this app includes a plethora of chain restaurants and things of the sort to chose from. Highly recommend for anyone trying to watch how much the intake per day in the form of calories or tracking exactly how much of a macro they are getting.

----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been using this app for 4 months now but have years of experience with other food trackers. I originally started using this to get aggregate sodium levels which this app does beautifully. Most of the detailed data comes from their database and you can see all of macronutrients and micronutrients by single food, by meal or by day with ease. You can add custom foods or build recipes as needed. The app does a good job of making your most frequently tracked items easy to find.

----------------------------------------------------------
Hugely impressed with the size of the nutrition database in this app. It had everything I entered, and tons of restaurants too. The smart 'quick add' feature was able to automatically interpret what I wrote and display it as individual items with nutrition information laid out (note: it helps if you add a serving size like "2 eggs" or "1 tbsp whipped cream" otherwise it will just select the most common one for you). Very cool! Will definitely keep using this to track meals.

This app has it all, workout tracking, water tracking, the ability to search food by restaurants. It’s amazing and well designed. It even lets you import and export data to your IOS health app. I did however find a small bug. If you login to the app on your phone, then change your email/password on the website, when you close the app from recents it won’t carry over the login change and you’ll have to uninstall then reinstall to log back in. Other than that it’s perfect.

I have been using this app for two months, having just recently been diagnosed with diabetes 2. It is easy to use, intuitive, and it really works! I have driven my glucose readings down by 20 points, just following it’s guidance. It (almost) makes the process “fun”, like solving a huge puzzle with constantly changing parts. The macros bar helps me custom design new and interesting food combinations within my required constraints. I’m getting my wife hooked on it, too.

I can plan out my exact meals for the day to ensure daily success and good decision making. I like that it is not overly focused on weight loss as my goal is good nutrition.

I also really appreciate that there are no in-app charges.  I really, really like this one!!!  Thank you for creating it.

I gained weight after a foot surgery last year.  This app lets you keep up with your daily totals of food.  If I went over the allotted calories I have set for myself,  I still keep up with everything.  When I don’t lose I can look back and see what I need to do the next week.

I used this app back in the late summer and loved it.  It’s so easy to use and would track your weight loss progress in addition to calories and exercise.   Now I’m using it again but I’m not able to enter or see my progress in terms of weight loss.  There used to be a graph.  It looks like that part of the app is grayed out now and not available.  Total bummer.  Looking for another app but seriously disappointed.  😔

Developer Response:

Thank you for reaching out! The weight graph is still an available feature in the Track app. Can you send a screenshot of your Stats page to our team at support@nutritionix.com so that we can make sure your weight graph is set to a valid date range? Thanks!

If there is ever an update it would be nice to have a space to make short individual notes on each day. That way users can look back on certain days and try to improve their daily eating habits or routines while taking note of things they wild like to change. Just a suggestion that would be helpful.

I’m just getting started with this and so far I’m finding a lot to love. It’s easy and intuitive to use. It takes you to a ton of information in a snap, and I like the way it analyzes your entries. It’s really easy to add homemade foods. One important thing I don’t see, however, is a breakdown of added sugars (as opposed to naturally occurring), which I’m trying to keep below 20 grams per day. Possibly in an update?

I love this app. I couldn't figure out why I wasn't losing weight, I don't eat much. That was true, but I was eating high calorie foods. Using this app I was able to program in that I wanted to stay at about 1000 calories per day. By "budgeting" my calories I was able to drop a pound a day. I've lost 9 pounds and have 4 more to go. Once I reach my goal weight I can "up" my calories to allow me to maintain my weight.

The graphs and charts almost make controlling my sodium fun. Almost. But I have to do it and this is a great tool.

Title: Great App!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app for a few months now and I already know that this is my calorie tracking app for life! I love how it tells you your daily average and daily nutrition facts, and there is a large database with all kinds of foods! I also really like the feature in which you can scan a barcode because it specifies the food. Great app, love it!

Title: Solid app. Very helpful
----------------------------------------------------------
Many thanks to the developers. I discovered this app by chance and have used it for a week. Sure, there are little improvements I'd like (weekly total calorie count/deficit or ability to copy entire categories like copy all am snake items from previous day). I will continue to use and enjoy this app. Easy to use and definitely provides me with value.

Title: Easy to use
----------------------------------------------------------
This is the easiest to use nutrition tracking app. There are many great features like the goal tool which tells you how many calories to lose weight, large food/nutrient/exercise database, voice recognition, and display of recent entries that make food entry easy, ability to save your own custom recipes, and weight/calories/nutrition goal trackers.

Title: Super app!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Im doing a ketogenic diet so this is perfect for showing me my macro nutrition pie chart and Even though it took me a few tries to exactly figure it out the recipe maker works fantastically, plus its free, I'm a fat kid on a mission to lose the gut and get under 200 pounds for the first time in probably 11 years and this app is a tremendous help!!!

Title: Dietitian approved
----------------------------------------------------------
As a registered dietitian, I've used a lot of tracking and fitness apps. This is by far my favorite. It's easy to use and there's a coach function! My only concern is that functions seem to come and go. There used to be a voice function that I can't find anymore and the nutritional analysis was recently scaled back, which is a huge bummer.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your comments, Joe! The logging-by-voice feature is still available in the app, so if you need help checking your settings to ensure you've allowed microphone permissions, don't hesitate to contact our team at support@nutritionix.com. Also, the nutrition facts display is being restored in a new update, set to release later today. Be sure to update at that time so that you can see the full nutrient summaries. We're excited to hear that you are using the Coach Portal! ***UPDATE: The new version is available! Please update your app to restore the display of the full nutrition facts. If you are still having trouble accessing your log-by-voice feature, please let us know so that we can get you back on track!

Title: Great app!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app keeps you on track and motivate you to not exceed your daily intake of calories! It was like a challenge for me trying not go over the suggested number and I ended up losing 15 pounds in 3 months! Of course I needed to exercise and go to the gym to burn the excess of calories of the cheesecake I had for breakfast for a whole week.

Title: Love To “Track”
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is so easy to use!  I’m learning about calories, carbs and fat in the foods I eat that impact my weight.  I’m inspired by the app to stick to my goals — trading exercise for foods that I want to eat.  Today is my 3rd day and I know I’ll stay on Track! In addition, I bought 2 of the recommended products —can’t wait to thy them :).

Title: Wow, everything I need
----------------------------------------------------------
There are tons of apps out there and I feel lucky to have gotten it right on the first try with this app.  Easy, easy, easy, to use.  They are updating the food lists all the time. I tried to enter a jalapeño yogurt dip but it wasn't in the system.  Next day I got an email saying they added it to the food list.  Blew my mind.   Nice app.

Title: Perfectly simply and accurate
----------------------------------------------------------
As a paramedic and a person who recently lost over 70 pounds - I found this app super easy to use.  I have to watch my protein and calories.  If you just simply scan the bar code all the work is done.  Really the best app I have found and the customer support with questions is very friendly and fast. Again highly rate and love this app.

Title: Really is 60 seconds for the day!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using myfitnesspal. You MUST try this smart feature, where you just type in what you ate and the app figures it all out and enters it. It's so easy! Their numbers are accurate, you don't have random users entering wrong information. Also! They have nutrition info for TONS of restaurants! Seriously, try this app, it's awesome!

Title: Amazing and Free
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried many calorie counting apps before, but to get the most out of them you had to purchase premium or the apps that were completely free we’re hard to use. Expect this one. I love this app and I wish I had found it sooner. I can track my macros, my exercise, my water intake, EVERYTHING! Best app for weight loss I’ve found.

63 year old (now former) diabetic. Unbelievably simple to use, read, figure out and plan with. I use it short and long term. It just plain makes sense. Brand info quite current. MY WEIGHT LOSS GOAL IS 130 lbs.  The simplicity & organization of this fantastic app HAS HELPED ME LOSE 86 LBS SO FAR. Enough said. Incredibly many thanks.

----------------------------------------------------------
I don't buy or eat a lot of processed food so I've never known how to gauge calories. I love this app- just type exactly what was in my salad and the ingredients pop up with amounts I can edit. Integrating this app with my exercise routine will help me reach my goals. Plus I get a breakdown daily of my nutrition values... love it!

Title: Exactly What I Was Looking For!
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this app! I set out to find a simple calorie tracker and this is the app to get! This app contains popular foods from all brands and can even estimate the calories from your family recipes! I also really enjoy how you can type in what you ate in oz. and it gives you the calorie count! Thanks for making a simple app!

I don't normally write reviews (as cliché as that line is) and it's actually been a few years that I have written a review for an app. However, this app is absolutely amazing and I needed to tell the developers how much I appreciate this app. I've used other apps to track calories, but this is by far superior. Thanks a bunch!

----------------------------------------------------------
I first got myfitnesspal to try to track the calories I burned and ate, but it had ads and kept wanting me to upgrade to pro. I tried this app instead and I love it! I can search for all different types of food, it keeps track of my weight and goals, and I can put in my steps and it shows me how many calories I have burned!

----------------------------------------------------------
First, I'm not a fitness app gal BUT I've been searching for an app to keep track of foods for a while. I'd download them then erase them because they were either complicated or not a good fit. Not this time! I LOVE this app. The support (hi Ashley!) is incredible as is the turn around time. Download it. You'll like it too.

Title: Great!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app, it's very user friendly. I like the simplicity, my time is valuable and I don't want to spend it figuring out a complicated app, or counting calories for that matter. I tried a few others and they asked too many questions in the beginning, this one I just downloaded and went about my calorie counting.
