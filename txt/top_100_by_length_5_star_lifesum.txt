Title: Incredible and perfect
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is with every penny. I purchased the annual subscription and have been using it for only about a week but so far it's been incredibly valuable. I have been entering in every meal, snack, and my water intake. Drinking water has helped me to be healthier and stay hydrated! I've been hitting my goals every single day. I love the design of the app, it's so beautiful. The designer did an amazing job at creating a very nuanced and detailed experience. It's a joy to use this app and it's fun! The illustrations and colors are fantastic. I was a MyFitnessPal user for years and since they were acquired by UA they stopped updating, improving, and evolving the app in any way. This is fitness and food tracking at a new and modern level. It's really a wonderful app. It is absolutely helping me to reshape my lifestyle. The added bonus is the integration of recipes that you can easily add to your meal tracking, not to mention the food is actually pretty good and simple to make. What more could you want? Also it's really nice to be able to choose between different types of diets, with each adjusting the calories you should be having at each meal. A feature that's really awesome is being able to see a summary of your intake for the day, which is broken down and categorized across protein, carbs, and fat, in a beautiful infographic of graphs and pie charts. I love just looking at this app!  So in that way it's quite personal, which makes the whole experience far more engaging than any other fitness app I've ever used. It's well worth the price and I will continue to use the app throughout my day to stay on track and be as healthy as possible. Keep up the amazing work Lifesum!

Title: READ THIS
----------------------------------------------------------
So I think everyone can agree that losing/maintaining/gaining weight or just even remembering to eat healthily can be a very tough thing for anybody. This app, is honestly the HOLY GRAIL of nutrition tracker app. AND YES I SAY NUTRITION, because it is not just a weight loss, cal counter, water tracker, it‚Äôs so much more than that. I know this because I can probably say I have used every freakin app to try and make the habit of healthy living stick. So there is a few bugs here and there but nothing I can say that would make me stop using it. Mainly just certain calories not matching up etc. but I doubt the makers of this app can control that due to it probably being inputted from other resources, BUT I will say, it‚Äôs almost 75% accurate if you‚Äôre not specifically measuring anything out. I‚Äôm saying this because I do measure everything out, and honestly if you do measure your food and put it into the app, it is extremely accurate, some of the work has to be put on your side because a phone screen cannot accurately calculate how much your eating. It is a tool!!!! An extremely useful, well made, and STUNNING tool to help you along whatever health journey you are going on. My FAVORITE function of the app of all is you can create your own recipes where it calculates the calories in what you made, let me tell you, an absolute game changer. If you have an Apple Watch, it pairs the app to your activityüòç. I lost 14 lbs and toned up (of course with exercise and such) but with this app by my side I honestly felt like it was effortless. Just try it for yourself I promise.

Title: So elegant and visually appealing
----------------------------------------------------------
What a gorgeous app- that alone makes me want to open it and track. I love that it there's a water tracker, daily fruit and vegetable and weekly seafood tracker and that they give you a life score with details on what to improve each week. Sure, a few glitches like not currently syncing with Health app (I open both then close both and open once more then it tracks), and the recipes and sometimes the database doesn't have the exact food but does have something comparable, just takes a smidgen more work. The beta camera isn't the greatest if you have a deep dish as opposed to a plate but it sure is handy and easy enough to adjust. And there's not many recipes, but the ones available are easy to follow and pleasant to eat, plus how often does one follow a recipe to a T? I've tried other tracking apps (looking at you MFP) and all the ads and monotone color scheme make them too unidimensional- this is beautiful, too beautiful not to use. And the step counter that equates steps to what you burn makes me just competitive enough with myself to make me want to walk even more (I burned 1.5 croissants?!? Bet I can burn 2!). I'd like to buy the app developers a beer. Then go walk said beer off. I saw a couple of review that say the app is rigid in terms of certain foods like sunflowers, and though I appreciate the sentiment, I am using the app for weight loss and do indeed want to know if a food is high in caloric content.

Title: Delete My Fitness Pal!
----------------------------------------------------------
I don‚Äôt normally review apps but this is one EVERYONE should definitely try. This is the first app that I‚Äôve actually lost weight with.. it actually helps you develop better eating habits. I know that there‚Äôs a lot of hype behind My Fitness Pal, but I swear, after trying both, LIFESUM BEATS MY FITNESS PAL HANDS DOWN. Nearly everything since the app has gone through updates is perfect. The user-face is simple and easy to use, without the annoying ads other apps have. You can adjust everything to fit your personal goals, even if they go beyond what the app recommends. They even include a macro calculator that makes things easy to calculate. The grading scale is really helpful to see where you can improve. It takes everything into account, calories, macros, sugar, fiber... it‚Äôs pretty comprehensive. Also, I love that I can keep everything private, it‚Äôs not necessarily a competition against all of my Facebook friends. The graphs and diagrams make seeing long term trends quick and easy. One thing I would love to see is something that suggests meals or specific items that would meet the goals of the meal. If I have 200 calories left and haven‚Äôt met my protein, fat, or carbs goals, what can I add to my meal that fits my goals? Other than that, the developers have done an absolutely stellar job.

Title: Beautiful! But could use customized notifications.
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is gorgeous! I love the articles and the recipes look absolutely scrumptious. The aesthetics alone are what make this the most effective app, and it is super smooth! Even on this old phone, where everything else crashes. Huge thanks to the devs for achieving this. Now, I turned on notifications expecting reminders to update my water or add my meals and exercise, which would be really nice! Sometimes you get busy and don't track anything; it is the LAST thing on your mind. I did, however, get constant reminders to update my weight. As someone who has a Lifesum of 119 (almost completely perfect! üò≤), I find that a little unhealthy. No-one should be weighing themselves every day, especially if you already have an unhealthy relationship with your weight, body fat percentage, or food. Even on a practical level, it doesn't make much sense. So I turned off the notifications, but it would be nice to be able to select what kind of notifications we get in the future! Such as for new recipes or articles, and reminders in other areas of body and health maintenance. Or a way to change the frequency: Weighing yourself every X amount of days. If there is already a way to do this, I hope the settings for it become easier to find. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks for reading!

Title: Love the app as is but would also love upgrades
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using Lifesum to track my intake.  It is easy to use and very visual.  However, there are a couple of upgrades I would like seeing.  First, I would like to see Fat broken down into Total, Sat, Monounsaturated, and Polyunsaturated.  I would also like to see Carbs broken down into Total, Fiber, Sugar Alcohols, Added Sugar, and Net Carbs.  (Currently, the app simply subtracts fiber from total carbs to calculate net carbs.). Also, since I work with a functional medicine professional who is interested in seeing my intake, I would like to see the ability to export data.  As I used to program (albeit mainframe),  I know how long upgrades take to implement; it is possible some of these are already in the works.  They were meant only as suggestions.  Long story short, I am very happy with the app as it is even if it misses some of my personal desires.  Thank you for the work you put in to bring such a useful app to market.  Oh, last but not least, I think it would be better to let users know that full, continued use of the app requires a subscription.  The cost is nominal for the usefulness, but it was frustrating when I first found out about the cost after downloading the app.

Title: Awesome, but there are some errors.
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using this app for as long as I can remember and I recently just upgraded to the Premium, which I love! I love the aesthetic of the app and the visuals and colors it uses. I love the wide variety of recipes, even thought I don‚Äôt use them that much. I love the weekly rating I get so that I can look at my past week and see what I need to improve on for the next one. However, there are a couple things I find I have trouble with. The main thing is that when I go to update my weight, I check on it the next day and it says ‚ÄúNothing lost, nothing gained.‚Äù So whenever I update my weight and maybe i‚Äôve lost a pound or two, i‚Äôll update my weight. But the next day when I go to look at my weight it erased it or changed it back to the starting weight. It does this almost all the time and is pretty annoying because I have to delete the starting weight that it put it back on for that day, at the same time deleting the weight that I put in. Another thing that‚Äôs minor is that when I go to take a picture of my food, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work and the picture never shows up. I do really love this app but I don‚Äôt know if anyone else has the weight changing itself issue or not.

Title: Fan of Lifesum it's helped me a lot
----------------------------------------------------------
So Lifesum has seriously helped me. I haven't had any glitches with my app and don't struggle with added food to my food diary tracker. It's really easy and simple to follow, it does the math for you, to figure out how many calories your eating, how many grams of carbs, protein, and fat your consuming and how many you have left to consume. I've done the ketone diet before I got Lifesum... I only lost 2 pounds a month and was completely confused why I wasn't losing more! I got the Lifesum app and it showed me (by tracking everything I ate) that I wasn't eating the right balance of carbs, protein and fat for the ketone diet. I was floored when I found out certain brands of food that I thought were healthy was totally ruining my diet. I lost about 10 pounds within less than 6 weeks solely by using this app. I can scan in barcodes of food items I get and see how much of it I can eat. It's great, Lifesum rates it for me too to see if it's a good fit for my diet. I'm gonna keep and use this app for a while. And they have awesome recipes too.

Title: The only health app I‚Äôve stuck with
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve tried lots of different apps to help me along my fitness journey and this is the only app I have been able and have wanted to stick with. It‚Äôs awesome when you track your food and are able to see a rating beside what you‚Äôve had. Also, it‚Äôs very easy to track your exercise. As of recently, I have purchased an Apple Watch and it makes it even easier because it just takes the activity information from my watch and coverts it into the app. There is also a cool weight tracker you can use to count towards your weight goals. Tracking water intake is also nice and the app even gives you tips and encouraging words to reach your water, calories per meal, and exercise goals. I thought every app like this was the same and they all seemed so hard to figure out. Lifesum is short, sweet, and simple and I give the creators and developers of this app major props because usually I get bored within this category of apps, but this one has kept me focused and excited to use it. Thank you, Lifesum!

Title: Great app but needs more fine tuning options
----------------------------------------------------------
I work offshore and I‚Äôve been using this app now for a little over a week and it‚Äôs been great for helping me cut back and really monitor what I‚Äôm eating. My only problem is the lack of fine tuning for your personal goals. For example I‚Äôm following the 5:2 diet plan and for the 5 days that I‚Äôm not fasting during the week I‚Äôm expected to eat close to 3500 calories a day? That‚Äôs absurd considering I put in the same information (height, weight, etc.) on a separate website and I was told I needed to take in at the most 1700-2300 calories a day depending on how active I am during the day, to lose weight. The math doesn‚Äôt add up and it‚Äôs kind of frustrating to have the app telling me I‚Äôm failing at meeting my daily goals outside of my 2 fasting days. I suggest a future update that allows members to pick their diet plan and then be able to fine tune it to their individual needs. Other than that it‚Äôs an outstanding app that‚Äôs been really keeping me committed to eating healthier!

Title: Fantastic
----------------------------------------------------------
This might be the first time I‚Äôve ever written an app review but this app is amazing. As long as you‚Äôre diligent with inputting the food you eat, it keeps track of everything for you. Calories, protein, carbs, fat, etc. It tailors all of it to the specific diet you choose and how much weight (if any) you want to lose, based on your height, weight, and timeframe. Beyond that, it gives you recipes, weekly ratings (in premium version, but the free version is well worth the download too) on how balanced and healthy your diet is, what you can improve on, and even gives you additional trackers for the areas you‚Äôre working on. You get fun smiley faces to denote how healthy your food choices are. All in a wonderfully designed and eye pleasing package. They even include stickers too! I‚Äôve already lost weight and feel better and I can sleep better at night being more aware of exactly what I‚Äôm eating. Can‚Äôt recommend this app enough. It‚Äôs changing my life!

Title: I‚Äôm FINALLY making progress with my weight loss
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this app, it might sound silly but I think part of why it really works for me is how good the app looks, and it‚Äôs much simpler (in my opinion) than my fitness pal. I‚Äôve read that the database isn‚Äôt as big as MFP but I haven‚Äôt run into any problems with being able to track my food or scan barcodes. When I first started using the app I lost 8 pounds in the first few weeks, so I‚Äôm finally under 160lbs! I haven‚Äôt been very consistent recently but I‚Äôve just picked it back up again tracking calories and staying under my daily goal. I also love how simple it is to track macros. Overall, I‚Äôve been wanting to lose weight for YEARS and stop gaining 10lbs/year on average and this is the FIRST tool I‚Äôve found that has actually helped me make progress. Only negative I have is the meals on the different plans can‚Äôt be changed so I can‚Äôt really do them because I‚Äôm allergic to shellfish (I could probably just substitute though LOL)

Title: Review and Comparison
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve compared this to other top food logging and calorie counter apps over the last three weeks and believe this one to have the best interface and work best with my needs and goals. It works to keep me accountable and mindful of my choices without restricting anything. I like that it connects to my Apple devices and adjusts my available calories based on exercise (the more I exercise, the more I can‚Äôt eat)! That feature has been very helpful. The scan tool works mostly well but there have been several items not yet in their database. There is an option to help grow that if you take the time to enter in all the nutritional info on a package. The most difficult thing with this (and all the food logging apps) is entering in homemade food, e.g. the chicken noodle soup I made last Sunday... other than that, I give it 5 stars and will continue to use it. It‚Äôs  already had an impact on my lifestyle (and I‚Äôve lost several pounds)!

Title: It Works!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Before using LifeSum, I felt incredibly unhealthy, bloated, and tired all of the time. I was 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 125 pounds, which is considered to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, but I noticed that my weight was only increasing and I started to gain a lot of weight in many areas of my body. I started using this app a month ago and I weighed myself this morning at 114 pounds. Turns out, the culprit for me gaining weight and feeling so terrible all of the time was my diet! Things I thought were healthy before were actually very unhealthy. LifeSum has shown me what is healthy and what is not, and it has also prevented me from overeating - something that I did all of the time. Thank you so much LifeSum! I feel much more energetic and more in shape after using this app. I now have a flat stomach and no double chin, so this app is a true miracle. I‚Äôm not even on the premium plan, so you can still lose weight without it! I highly recommend it!

Title: Highly Recommend
----------------------------------------------------------
I never write reviews for apps, but this one is an exception. I‚Äôve been going to the gym a lot lately and wanted to start to balance out my food calories and burned calories. I downloaded LifeSum and MyFitnessPal just to see which one helped me better - LifeSum exceeded my expectations by a long shot. The layout is aesthetically pleasing and super easy to use. To be fair, it might take some time to get a hang of logging certain things, but I keep finding new features and I love it! As a rule I never buy premium versions of apps (with the exception of Spotify) but I bought the premium version of LifeSum and I don‚Äôt regret a penny of it. This has helped me out so much - I highly recommend the Clean Eating Plan, or the Keto Easy Plan (even if you aren‚Äôt keto ‚Äî I‚Äôm not, but I am trying to cut down on carbs and Keto Easy helps so much). I love this app

Title: So easy to track calories, protein, fat!
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to do this in a spreadsheet. After adding foods I eat frequently that were not already in the huge database, I can easily set up my day and make changes if my schedule, dining out, grocery shopping changes. It's so clear I need to add exercise, as I know my precise intake and don't want to eat less. Things I would like added: ability to add a food to My Things when after scanning, finding it barcode was already in the database and verifying the food had been correctly entered, instead of only having the ability to add it to my diary. I had searched for it before I tried to manually add it, but it didn't show up. If it's in My Things, it will show up quickly at the top. I would also like to see a schedule of my nutrition, exercise and weight progress in addition to the progress bar that shows my starting, current and goal weight.

Title: Best nutrition app out there!
----------------------------------------------------------
I can definitely say this is the best nutrition/logging app I have ever had. For a number of months I was in a bad relationship with food‚ÄîI was a binger and a restricter. This app helped me overcome this so quickly. What's different about this app from others is that looks much more in-depth than most free nutrition apps. I recommend the subscription for the whole experience, but even without it, it's very helpful. I am now numerous weeks clean from binging because this app gives many more notes. It informs you for approximately how many calories you should be eating per meal, the balance of macros, and the nutrition/rating of food. It even gives you a complete rating for your meals and day! I've tried MyFitnessPal, but it never really gave as much info as this app. It really is a helpful app, and I completely recommend it!

Title: BUY PREMIUM! -Broke College Kid
----------------------------------------------------------
I had this app for months before I caved and bought the premium version. The free version is nice for basic food tracking purposes, but if you are really looking for an easy way to learn more about your health GET THE PREMIUM VERSION! This is coming from someone who has tried numerous diets and researched healthy eating immensely for over a year. This has made it so much easier to eat balanced meals. I start off with what I know I want to eat and it will tell me if I need to add more fat or protein and what‚Äôs good and bad about the food. I‚Äôve been using the premium version for 3 days and have already learned so much! The life scores are very motivating. I see myself sticking with this for a while. It DID take me a while to figure out the layout of the app. But give it time, you won‚Äôt regret it!

Title: Great so far
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm on day fifteen of the ketogenic light diet and it's been tough with cravings but this app is really a great guide and inspiration. I really love how it has the scanner and adjusts you calorie amount for the day based on what you eat. I really like the tips that describe the effects and stages of what diet your on each day. I was so excite when I saw it tested me to see which diet is good for me based on my wants and needs. I gave four stars because the scanner is a bit wonky and they need to expand the food from groceries stores like publix, Whole Foods and popular restaurants. The scanner usually is okay but sometimes it refuses to recognize basic food like a potato. Overall thought I think this app is going to be life changing for me and I'm hoping to lose 30-40 pounds with life sum!

Title: Less data but more useful than other apps
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve tried all the big names in calorie tracking but this is the only app that actually encourages a healthy relationship with food, in my experience. With LifeSum, you get high-level overviews of what you‚Äôre eating along with easy, actionable ways to improve your diet. By contrast, with MFP and Cronometer, I would often get so caught up in the minute details that I wouldn‚Äôt know what to change in my diet. LifeSum strikes a much better balance of giving the details most people need without overwhelming you with data. I highly recommend LifeSum if you‚Äôre someone who gets obsessive when using other apps because I‚Äôve found it to be much gentler on my mental health (although please talk to a doctor if you have a history of disordered eating because any kind of calorie counting can be touchy)

Title: Learning how to use this is key!
----------------------------------------------------------
At first I gave this app a bad review because I honestly wasn‚Äôt informed about how to use it. I was having difficulty adding my own items and macro information and I thought you couldn‚Äôt. After getting some help, this app is seriously the best! All you have to do is scan a barcode and bam, all the info is in there and you can easily track what you‚Äôre eating and your macros. It‚Äôs also extremely easy to add your own items if they aren‚Äôt in the system, or if it‚Äôs a home cooked meal you made. I highly recommend this app! I‚Äôm trying to lose weight in the new year, and this has really opened my eyes to how much fat and sugar and crap I was eating that I thought was healthy. This easily allows me to immediately see and track the nutritional value of what I‚Äôm putting into my body. I love it!

Title: Overall Such a Great App!
----------------------------------------------------------
I really enjoy this app! I initially downloaded it to help count macros because I am vegetarian and sometimes struggle to ensure I get enough protein every day. This app helps keep my protein intake (and fat and carbs) top of mind. One thing I wish I saw more was I take of other key nutrients - like fruits and veggies, which currently are just counted for carb intake. Since all carbs aren‚Äôt created equal, it would be helpful if carbs such as breads and pasta were differentiated from sweet potatoes and greens, for instance. But, a great thing it does do is account for added and naturally occurring sugars, so that helps a bit with fruit sugar vs pasta, packaged goods, etc. I also love the barcode scan function. All in all, I plan to use this app for a long time. Good work!

Title: Great app, worth the cost, getting better
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this app! They thought alot about what operations will take the most time and tried to make them easier. You can create custom foods, then create meals (sets of food items) and add them to the directory. The dirctory is well organized with features like searching and marking favorites. People complain about the food database, but these things take time to develop and it sounds like they will be user submitable, so they will be handled by the community. Also the nutritional information varies a lot between different brands, so you are going to have to end up entering in a lot of custom foods anyway, I don't see this as a problem or an issue that iShape could possibly solve aside from doing what they have already done and make an expandable database.

Title: Excellent and Easy to Use
----------------------------------------------------------
I use this app every day without fail. It has made me exponentially more aware of what I am eating and how much I snack throughout the day. By tracking what I eat carefully, I have been able to make smarter food choices and I snack mindlessly far less than I used to. I also love the water, fruit, and vegetable trackers because I have also been consciously drinking more water and making a point to eat more vegetables. The app is beautifully designed and very user friendly, and I enjoy it so much that I paid for the full subscription. I use this app more than I use social media. I appreciate that the app helps making healthy choices fun and simple, and I would highly recommend it regardless of whether you are trying to lose weight or not.

Title: This App is the only one that works for me
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm not a very self motivated person, I'm not driven for health or weight loss and I don't know why but it's hard for me (probably because prior to this point in my life I was naturally slim). Anyway, this app has been amazing for me, I took the test to see what diet would fit my needs and found that Keto-light was a fit. After reading up on it, I decided to give it a go. It grades my meals and tells me what to do to improve my food choices, helps me find recipes and able to save my own, I have been using the app for a little over 2 months and have lost 15lbs. This was with no extra exercise, just diet! I'm also a breastfeeding mom and I appreciate that it allows me to add to my calorie allowance to account for the extra that I need.

Title: Best honest app!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I found this app having a great ux design and a beautiful graphic design. One of my fav apps. What I love the most is that the free version is as good and efficient and resourceful as the premium . I absolutely recommend the free version at the beginning, you will fall in love with the app and its features so much that you will need to buy the premium that it‚Äôs just like having a personal coach 24/7. In the past I had very bad experience with another app that took my money and never heard back from them. Even if I ask for rectification. Lifesum is an honest app they don‚Äôt take your money for nothing. You pay when you want and they give you the best they can offer that is top. I keep using this app since 2015 it just keeps improving.

Title: So balanced!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Your don't have to eat small amounts to lose weight! If you exercise, they factor it in. They want you to eat healthily, not less, because they give you how many carbs, and how much fat and protein you've had that day. They have it automatically set to a certain amount, but if you don't feel that's how many carbs you should be eating, or how many cups of water you should drink, you can change that! There's even help for gaining weight. I don't like the grading system, but I can ignore that. This app isn't magic, you have to have discipline and patience to enter everything you eat, but it works. Dropped 5 pounds the first week. After I stopped needing to lose weight, I kept it around just to help me eat healthier. This app is üëå

Title: Amazing to use
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been on the hunt this year for the best of everything. I‚Äôve literally downloaded 8 different apps developed for the purpose of losing weight and/or living a healthy lifestyle. I downloaded and learned this one, sadly, last. It‚Äôs so straight forward. I just wanted a little push to help keep me on my goals. And I‚Äôve seen the competing apps, some I didn‚Äôt even understand what they were asking for me to input. This one has everything I need, in a comprehensive and straight forward layout. It‚Äôs detailed but simplistic. I think the only way I could do better is if I hire an actual nutritionist and personal trainer to follow me around everywhere, and goodness knows I‚Äôm not doing that. Thanks for the great and easy to use app!

Title: Best thing that happened to me
----------------------------------------------------------
I was pretty overweight when I downloaded this app. I decided to use it and stick with it. I paid for the 1year subscription and stuck with it. I tracked most of the days, forgot to track a few. I lost 64 pounds in a little over a year. The best part about this app is it teaches you so much about nutrition. Enough that now I don‚Äôt even have to track my calories because I can maintain my weight with my own judgement. I still use it though because I have a few more pounds to lose and then I will see how it does with gaining muscle mass. I just love the interface and the ratings as smiley faces, it makes it simple to use. I just want to say thank you to the app developers because of you all my life is tremendously better.

Title: Life Changing
----------------------------------------------------------
I usually don‚Äôt write reviews, but this is literally the best app I‚Äôve ever bought. I‚Äôm 14 and I want to lose 15 lbs in a healthy way. It gave me a 15 week period and I thought ‚Äúokay that‚Äôs reasonable‚Äù, but then I started using it and it‚Äôs motivated me so much I‚Äôve lost 6.2 lbs, it‚Äôs been 2 weeks. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as motivated to use it if it wasn‚Äôt such an enjoyable of an experience. The design is flawless and the little icons are adorable. I love using the barcode scanner, then I don‚Äôt have to figure out if I actually ate what I logged. The life rating is really motivational, and ever since I had a day tracker for fruit and a weekly tracker for seafood, I‚Äôve been eating lots more of those.

Title: Got me out of a slump
----------------------------------------------------------
Started working out a while ago and had an initial loss then I adjusted and didn't lose anything for three months. Being able to track everything on a device I carry anyway was a huge difference maker for me. Quickly realized I was not eating enough on my workout days and over compensating on the rest days. Also does a great job keeping me honest on the weekends. Every improvement I can think of such as coordinating with say Subway to put all their data in is probably beyond the price. I usually end up manually putting in one meal a day so overall I spend 10-15 minutes a day which is way less than I exercise, but those are the minutes that are making a difference for me on the scale.

Title: My perfect health app!
----------------------------------------------------------
So far I have been using this app for about two weeks, and it‚Äôs actually very impressive. I am coming from Samsung Health, which has helped me a lot over the past year and a half. However, after comparing the two, this app has so much more versatility and it‚Äôs very acute regardless of which diet you choose. I decided that I was going to go with the diet plan Clean Eating, and in doing so realized how off course my diet was. More specifically, my sugar addiction problem. I have been working on improving my cooking and reducing my sugar consumption so that I can live a much healthier life. With everything that is offered, I definitely believe that this app is worth paying for.

Title: Love it, but one small bug
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using Lifesum for about 10 days now, and I really enjoy using it. It's simple, and easy to use. My goal with Lifesum is to help me eat more, since I under eat a lot. While my under eating problems have been getting better since using Lifesum, there is one bug that kinda annoys me. Whenever I log a meal, it says that it is a few calories under, which is a really helpful aspect of this app. Sometimes, this feature bugs out, and gives the incorrect number of calories under. For example, if I log 200 calories of food, it will say that I am 200 calories under the minimum goal, which isn't true. Hopefully this bug will be fixed soon, because it's really driving me crazy.

Title: LOST 50 LBS!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I never ever write reviews but this one felt like a must. After I read the reviews and contemplated paying for the $40 yearly subscription, I did. The app and platform itself is simple and aesthetically pleasing, therefore I felt this app would hold me accountable better than I could hold myself accountable. Although I didn‚Äôt log food every day and only used a couple recipes, the ‚Äúupdate your weight‚Äù button kept me motivated to weigh myself everyday and think more consciously about my intake. I also enjoy that my watch activity connects to the platform, adjusting my goal caloric intake based on my plan. After 4 months I am down 50 pounds and I‚Äôm not done yet. Thanks Lifesum!

Title: Pretty good üëç
----------------------------------------------------------
Lifesum is a great app. It offers so much and helps me make better choices on what I'm eating. It is hard to follow up on. I did it for about 3 days, was super happy with it, then quit doing it because it took a lot of effort for a busy person like me, then started again a few days ago. It has helped me a lot overall. Another issue I have with it is that it has so many plans and recipes, but only premium members can use most of them. I have to pay for the food that it tells me I should eat to be healthier or reach my daily goal, and paying for premium is too much for me. Overall I think it's a great app that helps a lot, but there should be more options for free members.

Title: My go to
----------------------------------------------------------
I love Lifesum. I have used loseit and other trackers in the past but I really enjoy this one. I feel as though it is more accurate, it does a breakdown of everything including sugar and sodium and it lets me know if my diet is balanced or not. It tells me to eat more fish or if I need to eat more calories. It is all based on the plan you pick and there are many to choose from. It also has a water tracker that you can track either glasses or bottles. usually I will start tracking my food and then quit but with this one I stay tracking, even if I eat bad. It sends me reminders to log my meals but it doesn't hound me with notifications. Like my title states, it's my go to.

Title: Best Fitness//Diet Tracker for IPhone!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this for 3 weeks now and can't live without it.  It's definitly helped me keep better track of my caloric intake and burning.  I thought I was doing ok with pen and paper, but I would forget sometimes to write things down -- this is so easy, I have stuck to it without a problem.  The updates with this new version are great.  CONS:  It only saves 7 days (bad!!) and there is no way to email/save the data.  I work with a personal trainer and I don't have anyway to give him a copy of my log and it's hard for me to look back to see my progression week over week and analyze.  Please FIX!  If that doesn't bother you too much, it is WELL worth the $$.

Title: Loving This App
----------------------------------------------------------
Totally enjoying this app. I was 309lbs and couldn‚Äôt loose weight. I only started doing this app at first because I had to go on the low iodine diet for testing. I just wanted to track what I was eating. I started loosing weight on the diet and decided since I was finally loosing weight I would continue using the app.  It shows me how many calories my body needs and if I eat something that‚Äôs not acceptable I get a sad face. I‚Äôm just three weeks in and weight 277.4 pounds. I‚Äôve done several diets in the past! This isn‚Äôt a diet, this for me is a teaching tool of how to live a better in more healthier way. FYI, I am just using the free part of the app. üëçüèª

Title: Easy to understand
----------------------------------------------------------
I was never a count your calories guy, and I used to be able to eat anything I wanted and never gained weight. Now that I want to workout and get fit, I don‚Äôt know what I should be eating and I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm eatings nutrition is. This app very simply tells you what you‚Äôre eating and how much more or less you should be taking in. The only thing is you need to be diligent to put what you‚Äôre eating in the app. If you can do that then you‚Äôll be shown how healthy the food you‚Äôre taking in is, quite surprised how many items are in their data base. Every item I‚Äôve eaten or made has been in their system and has a detailed nutrition chart for them

----------------------------------------------------------
Ive been using Lifesum for a couple months now. Honestly I don‚Äôt use it everyday (I don‚Äôt track on weekends) but I love it! I love the look of it and the fun and encouraging tone. Love being able to see my macros front and center and seeing how my meal is looking on carbs, fat and protein. Two edits: as a previous review stated, notifications could use some work. Don‚Äôt need to weigh myself every single day, and also don‚Äôt need notifications for things I‚Äôve already done (like log breakfast, etc.). Also get a note at 6 asking how my dinner was and I don‚Äôt eat til about 7:30 bc of my commute (this notification reminds me how much I hate it!! lol).

Title: Nice but limited food search and poor implementation of syncing fitness trackers
----------------------------------------------------------
I like the app because it's very fast and full of great features, but when I couldn't find things I'd definitely find on MyFitnessPal (which is free), then it makes paying for this app kind of ridiculous. I'd pay if I could search a food library like in MyFitnessPal, especially since you guys have cool things like choosing your own diet, in a pleasing-to-look-at app. HOWEVER, having to pay to sync my Fitbit (which I already paid money for) is beyond ridiculous when (you guessed it) MyFitnessPal does syncing for free. I bet people would still pay for personalized diets and you'd get more customers if you did these two things well AND for free.

Love this plan. This app is a MUST if you are on the Keto diet program. Highly recommend the app upgrade. It keeps you on track every meal and gives you hundreds of amazing Recipes. I have lost 19 lbs in less than a month. My max lifetime weight was 243 two months ago, I started the keto diet with this app 25 days ago and I weighed 224 this morning!  It is changing my life. I haven‚Äôt felt this good in years. The food is delicious, the recipes easy to prepare and I never get hungry. I also lost my cravings for bread, cookies and snacks. Amazing results for me. Highly recommend if you want to lose weight and stay healthy. Two thumbs Way  Up!!

----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm on a muscle bulk diet after dropping weight. I have a general diet planned out, but also enjoy snacking. I use my planned diet as my template, but this app is fantastic in that I can always track and keep notes about what I eat throughout the day. It makes it to where I can just glance rather than question what I‚Äôve eaten. It‚Äôs also nice because you can even make your own meals to use (I made a chipotle bowl on my cheat day). I compared nutrition next to the official Chipotle website and it was spot on! Using this with my Apple Watch in order to keep track of my net calories! So no more guilt or questioning. This is what I‚Äôve needed!

I‚Äôm so glad I found this app. They have thought of almost everything. Great layout for ease of use. Free app good and a reasonable fee for upgrade which I am enjoying. They should have a free 30 day trial for the upgrade which I‚Äôm sure people would want to use. And there is a note section which I love! I use it for ideas, notes on recipes, feelings for the day, etc. I also enjoy the icons! It makes a difference. The faces give immediate feed back. Very well designed! Thank you. One thing to fix, to add your own recipe or add food not found in calorie section, should be able to bring over into recents so you don‚Äôt have to keep adding it.

Title: What more can you ask for?
----------------------------------------------------------
Keeps track of food, calories, weight, water, exercise, and macronutrients - all in one easy-to-use app. It even connects to step trackers and has a barcode scanner for food so you don't have to look specific stuff up, though you can. The design is appealing and easy to use.  Reminders are somewhat customizable (turn em on or off for food, water, or exercise). That's all the free version. There's even more stuff in premium that I have not explored. I saw something about tracking measurements that looked interesting but thus far I'm still too cheap to go for it. Honestly, it's the best app of this kind I've tried.  I highly recommend it.

Title: Great for diabetics
----------------------------------------------------------
Recently diagnosed diabetic, so I tried the Ketonic diet in this app. Also tested a couple other apps side-by-side. Deleted the others. And lost 20 pounds so far. They make it easy to make intelligent food choices, even when eating out with friends, by putting all the data about your options right in front of you! And the recipes have been the real time saver. They really understand the different diets and push recipes to you that fit your diet, unlike the other apps that are totally calorie-centric (and completely untrustworthy for carb-sensitive people). A few more tweaks and they'll be the perfect app, but it's already a 5-star app.

Title: Great App
----------------------------------------------------------
Literally exactly what I was looking for. Main menu with everything right up front for you to see. Super easy to use. It knows 99% of things you can. If it doesn‚Äôt, you can easily just add the calories (which is all I care about). My one and only gripe about it is the water intake. I wish the water intake configuration was a little more customizable. Even though I‚Äôm an American, I prefer to use ml. As of right now you can only go by a 8 oz glass of water or a 16 oz bottle of water. A lot of people use refillable water bottles that typically like 24-64 oz. so no matter what you do, you can‚Äôt measure your water to the exact amount.

Does everything it says, and does so in a very user friendly way. It has a food database that I can use for some of my foods, but I LOVE being able to make my own foods and meals. Especially the meals, since I can set up all my meals in the database and then just chose that one when I have it. No need to constantly enter each item individually! The charts, graphs, and photos make a great addition to the program, that makes using it all that much more fun and informative. I would reccomend this app. to anyone and everyone, definitely worth the money. Anything that makes tracking your diet and weight fun is worth every penny. ;)

----------------------------------------------------------
Over the years i‚Äôve used different fitness apps trying to be healthy (I‚Äôm 17 now) and now i‚Äôve been on the journey to build muscle, so that means eating more. Over 2020 i‚Äôve gained 15 pounds!!! But even with my progress it was so hard to keep track of actually how much protien and calories I ate through the day. This is my fav app and I use it like everyday now!!!! It‚Äôs free for the basic version which works perfect & it‚Äôs so easy to look up the foods you eat or you can just scan the barcode which is my favorite. Literally 10/10, and I NEVER write app reviews because i‚Äôm too lazy but this one I knew deserves a good review‚ù§Ô∏è

I personally love the app and love about everything on it cause it really helps me track that amount of calories I eat and burn off so I don't have to keep writing everything down and you can't figure out how many calories you lost like any other ways so this is easy it is also easy to keep track and make sure I'm hydrated through out that whole the whole day, really the only thing I would ask for is to have the carbs right next to the calories since that's really the thing that's making me gain the most wait so I don't have to add everything up throughout the day thank you so much for the app tho I love it a lot‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

----------------------------------------------------------
Invested in myself with the premium version and use it on both my android and iPhone. Slightly different interfaces but both good. Some nutrition macros are off, but I don't mind correcting them. I Iike how I can add recipes, and the ketogenic "fat burner extreme" meal plan tool offers exactly the kind of tracking I was looking for. After years of different eating plans, this app has been a tool that helps me stay on track, its day 12 and I'm 8 lbs down in ketosis. I like the graphics and feel of this app more than others. A desktop version would be great for rapid entries, but I'll still use this without it.

Title: I always quit these apps.. not this time!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve trued tons of fitness/food apps, but always seem to quit after a week or two. Lifesum changed all that! I‚Äôve even lost 5 pounds just by being more motivated to eat healthy and exercise. The big difference for me is it rates the healthiness of foods, not just the calories. The app also nudges you if you eat too little, which I really appreciate! When I have an unhealthy day, Lifesum has good tips on how to improve, and congratulates you when you have a great day! I just wish you could turn on fruit/veggie/etc trackers without having to struggle in the Life Score first. Great app, WORTH the subscription!

I love this app and have been a premium member for more than a year. The team continuously makes the app better every month and actually listens to user feedback on what could be improved on. It's super easy to log what I eat during the week and be able to balance it out with my workouts. Some of my favorite features include a useful(though somewhat limited) recipe book and the seamless integration with Apple Health Kit and other smart health products(such as my withings scale). This app is extremely easy to use and I encourage anyone who needs help getting fit to definitely try it out! Thanks Lifesum Team!

Title: Fantastic
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used Lifesum for quite a while now and just loved how it is set up. I switched to MyPlate because I heard some hype about it, but found even with its features it just isn't nearly as nice as Lifesum. Lifesum is simple, easy to navigate, and has just enough on it to tell you what you need without clouding up the dashboard with things you don't want. It has nearly every exercise already on it (though I found when I input my climbing the calorie burned count seems high).  This app is amazing! If you need a macronutrient tracker or a calorie counter or a fitness tracker, use Lifesum! 100% recommended!

Title: Incredibly easy and effective
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm a 29 year old female. I started logging with Lifesum on January 8. It‚Äôs February 20, just less than two months later, and this morning marked the 19th pound I‚Äôve lost. Seriously - JUST LOGGING. I scheduled my ideal weight (140) and put my current (169) and set it to classic dieting which sounds limiting but is just being aware of your calories. When I reach the calories for the meal, I stop. It‚Äôs almost over-simple. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm losing weight like this, and I haven‚Äôt worked out even once so imagine what would happen if I did. Lifesum is my favorite tool for counting calories and weight loss!

Title: Get This App!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Amazing app to keep track of your diet and exercise! This app asks you your age, weight, height, and gender to calculate just the right amount of calories you should be eating. With notifications turned on, this app will remind you when its time to eat or drink some water. If you are willing to pay a monthly fee, you can go even deeper into your calculations by tracking the intches around your body parts. You can also get access to tasty and healthy recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Even if you dkn't want to pay, this app will benefit and enhance your life to the very fullest! Get this app!!!!!

Title: Much More Than A Journal!
----------------------------------------------------------
Lifesum is absolutely the most useful app I use. This app does not sit idly by, forgotten, like so many that are cumbersome to navigate with little reward for the work. With Lifesum I jot what I ate or scan the barcode and the app automatically notes all of the nutrition info for me. Even better, it syncs seamlessly with apple health kit, and also provides a range of nutrition plans (they are not "diets") to choose from to help you reach your own goals! It also "learns" your usual foods and keeps them at the ready for selection. Exercise log/calories burned? Water consumption? YES! It has those too!

Title: More plans
----------------------------------------------------------
Very nice app, but I‚Äôd love to see more meal plans that are built for more variety of goals. For example, I have a metabolic rate that‚Äôs faster than normal and I struggle to keep weight. This means, when I go over the amount of calories, and the amount of carbs and fats, it‚Äôs actually considered good rather than bad; (but going over the amount of protein remains not recommended) It would be nice to see a plan that would have these things in mind. Another feature that would be nice to see in the future is nutritional values like vitamins and such that you can keep track of from the foods you eat.

Title: The most beautiful way to lose weight
----------------------------------------------------------
Lifesum is a truly a revolutionary application for those who wish to lose weight or get into shape. When I downloaded the application, I was immediately amazed by the beautiful interface. Carefully designed and crafted, Lifesum includes everything you need to lose weight. It motivates you to stay and eat healthy when your about to go off track. It also makes sure you eat well. If you don't drink enough water, it sends you a notification of what you have done and the affect is has on your diet. So far I have lost 5lbs with Lifesum in the first week, so I'm very excited for future progress ahead.

Title: Best One Out There
----------------------------------------------------------
Personally I feel this is the best app I could ask for. It‚Äôs so good that I want to be on it 27/7. It‚Äôs very simple but shows great new things to try and it has all in one so you don‚Äôt have to pair it with other ones. I also feel you don‚Äôt need to buy premium but it is a good option if you want to branch out on new ways to record you food. I also like the fact that you can delete old recordings like I started last year but stopped because I got lazy. But now I‚Äôm trying it again for the new year and I was glad I could delete the old stuff and yea this app is so great and I‚Äôm glad I found it.

Title: Updated With HUGE ONLINE FOOD DATABASE!
----------------------------------------------------------
I paid $9.99 for this app and will not complain one bit about it. It is worth every penny. The GUI is great, it responds nicely, works as promised, and they have just added a *HUGE* online database of food. Yes, I no longer have to skip over foods because I don't feel like typing in the nutritional facts myself! How great is that? Searching for words like "Stuffing" and "pot roast" will bring up numerous choices that you can chose from, then once you pick the one you want, you can add it to your database with one click. It works seemlessly over the 3G, great app. Let's lose some weight!

I don‚Äôt normally write reviews but I thought this app deserved one! I‚Äôve been trying calorie counting/fitness apps for years and Lifesum does a fantastic job and I can safely say I won‚Äôt be trying another app soon. It‚Äôs appealing to the eyes, helpful for macro counting and offers meal plans that look and taste delish! I recently just noticed that it rates the food you log and tells you which ones are good for you and which ones are bad. This app has made me enjoy tracking my food, exercise, weight, and water intake. I highly recommend this app!! Can‚Äôt wait to try the pro version soon!

Title: Love!
----------------------------------------------------------
Still love this app but I do wish one thing. I wish there was a place to save your own recipes and be able to add them to your food journal that day. Example, I make my own Peanut butter and oatmeal balls. I know the cals and everything to these but I can‚Äôt find a pb ball that‚Äôs close to it when I look it up so I would have to type in ever ingredient separately in my journal. If there was place to do that then save that as a recipe that could then be chosen as a meal, would be amazing. Other than this it‚Äôs a great app. And even if you don‚Äôt pay the free portion is extremely useful.

I'm in love with this app! It's (VERY) easy to use which is great and it has a lot of food and exercise options which is great because all you have to do is look up the food, and click on it, it counts the calories for you! And he exercise options are great, especially with sports practices, because it has a lot of options like if I did easy, medium, or a hard workout! It also gives you tips and tricks to help motivate you, if fact it just told me a second ago, "you just danced, you need to stay hydrated! Grab a glass of water!" Sry for this long review I really just enjoy this app

Title: This is a great app
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this program.  The graphs give great feedback, and the diary is easy to use. The food database is great to get one started, but I like to use the labels and serving sizes from the food I'm actually buying in the store or restaurant (if the establishment has a nutritional chart otherwise I look up equivalents on the web for my entries).  These are easy to enter and once you have a few meal items (or meals as the food entries are easily defined either way) in the database it takes no time at all to do the diary.  The program works great and is very intuitive.

This app is fantastic! I use it all the time and I have no complaints. I have only ever used the free version and it works wonderfully. I used this app and set my goal and, after a few short months and regular exercise, I lost twenty-three pounds. The only problem is that once I got the update, couldn't open the app. Still can't, actually. Other than that, the app is beautiful and very well programmed. I still can't believe how well it worked. I feel great and energized, and I really appreciate clean, healthy food. get the app, you will not regret it by a long shot!

I have been using this app on and off now since the beginning of the year, and because of it I have lost a grand total of twenty two pounds. I still have some ways to go, but it is completely worth the time and effort. Although, I never did use the premium packaging because I cannot afford it, I do believe that this app has truly changed how I feel about my eating habits. If there is anyone reading this who feels nervous or humiliated about the awkwardness of using a fitness app, don't. It will get more natural and easier the longer you use it, so don't be worried.

----------------------------------------------------------
Best part about this app is that it's not specifically for people who are trying to lose weight like most other apps like this are. There are options for everyone, whether you ARE trying to lose weight, maintain your weight but eat healthier, or even gain weight (muscle mass). Also, there are so many options for different foods you can put in to your log, including brand names so you know that the macro count is accurate. I recommend this app to anyone who wishes to track their eating habits! Remember, workouts won't get you anywhere without the proper meal plan!

It's been so helpful, so easy and Kees me motivated. I've struggled with counting calories before. It made me feel super restricted but this app somehow makes me feel in control and makes me want to stay on track to reach my goals. I love tracking my food as crazy as that may sound! This app makes it fun and easy and gives you helpful, informative guidelines along the way!!! 10/10 recommend

I do not purchase apps often but during my fitness goals I hit a plateau, so I found this app and decided to give it a try. This is one of the best applications I have ever used!

I‚Äôd like to be able to create recipes and divide it into food portions plus save them like ‚ÄúRecipeIQ ‚Äú but for the most part I love the app, that‚Äôs a suggestion not complaint. I love the fact I can choose what type of diet I want to be on,  Intermittent fasting is what works for me. (5:2) how about you?

----------------------------------------------------------
Sooooooo, I can get a little wrapped around the axel.  I am all the type A.  I tired weight watchers once and promptly became anorexic, which they praised me for.  The counting and tracking brings out the worst in me.  How low can I go?  When I got back some lab work that made it clear I had to watch my nutrition more closely and switch off the high protein diet I had been following (history of kidney disease in my family and routine blood work showed some early detection red flags) I started looking for a way to track my protein intake and maintain my sanity.

The only thing that's a bit iffy with this app is the portioning and the averaging, but otherwise it's great. It's just how am I supposed to know how much of something I ate? Oh well, it's still good to keep track and useful for developing better eating habits. Especially once you realize what you've been cramming into your face hole. Another great thing about this app worth mentioning is the fact that it also has a lot of the different brands of certain foods too. I really recommend this app, it's very worth while and worth a try. Give it a chance!

This app is awesome. It's easy to use, easy to track your progress, very helpful with meeting your goals. The only complaint I do have is sometimes the specific items listed do not have accurate nutritional information (Ex. A certain brand of something says 1 cup has X amount of calories, but it actually has Y amount of calories per cup). And fixing the inaccurate information is a process because you have to report it and it has to be approved before it is changed. Highly recommend this app, though. Keep improving it and it will be huge in no time.

Title: Needs a lot of work before its worth the price
----------------------------------------------------------
The idea of this app is great, but it is not executed well. The most annoying issue I ran into was the fact that it doesn‚Äôt save your place if you change apps while you add a food/meal/recipe. If I paused while tracking the meal to get more info and went back, the entire meal was gone, and I‚Äôd have to start from scratch. I had some issues tracking weight and trying to delete info I added on accident, which isn‚Äôt very helpful when tracking. Overall, I liked the look and idea but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend paying for this app until many bugs are fixed.

I have fallen in love with Lifesum - I chose the keto strict plan - have been using this app for almost 2 months, I did purchase the upgrade & it is worth the extra bit of $$ ! The scan feature is so helpful - most restaurants come up - and I live & die by the daily ratings! The days I do super good with my macros are the days I have my losses, if I have a rough day (which thats ok!), I know to prepare for a stall or minor gain, but always get back on & keep following the plan! The app is also extremely user friendly - which is a huge bonus!

This app is nicely made. I‚Äôve used many nutrition tracking apps, and this one is most engaging by far. There‚Äôs great little touches like the grocery store beep when you scan an item, cute icons and characters. I love that it syncs with my health data to auto update my calorie allowance after exercise. I do wish there was more flexibility in setting days for 5:2 diets, since schedules can change from week to week. It would also be helpful to have an easy recipe builder for counting calories in home meals. But overall, I‚Äôm very happy with it!

I think this app is awesome because it holds my attention and the design is something I enjoy looking at everyday (unlike myfitnesspal). My only complaint is that the inventory of food they have is quite poor. I've noticed that entries done by real users are not accurate and then get circulated around. Example: There is a sweet potato entry that at 0 grams is over 2000 calories! Clearly incorrect... with that being said this app is great and I use everyday! Super easy to customize the setting to your needs without upgrading to premium.

This is a super simple and intuitive app, and with really nice design. Has a modern user interface. Tried my fitness pal but found this much more  pleasant to use. One advantage of my fitness pal is that they have more products added by other users. Fx here in Iceland I was able to find allot of local food brands. One drawback with that though is that the nutritional information might not be as accurate. It really came as a surprise to me how easy it is now to track your calorie √≠ take using apps like these.

----------------------------------------------------------
This app is great for tracking calories and the amount of water you drink during the day, also, If you exercise with your phone or Apple watch it will account for the calories you burned during your workout and add to the amount of calories you may consume for that day. The only thing that can be tricky with the app is when you eat out at privately owned restaurants which do not list calories. In this case you will have to add each individual food item. Overall, great application and I love that they have the app for the Apple watch!

----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app and have tried a couple other fitness tracking apps. This one is different because of the day ratings & food ratings which gives you a better idea of the overall health of the food at a glance, without having to do calculations. I like the ability to see the breakdown of fat/carb/protein and set goals for yourself based on these values. The app itself is very well designed, has great graphics and feedback, which makes you want to open the app and log your food every day!! Buying the premium membership is so worth it!

Title: Helps a LOT
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using Lifesum for 3 days and have really enjoyed it so far. I like being able to scan and track my meals, track my water intake, get inspired for my own recipes using theirs and track my weight loss. I‚Äôm down 1.3 lbs in 3 days and I attribute that to keeping a closer eye on my portions and macros using this app. The only things I don‚Äôt like about this app are my inability to create and save my recipes, as well as, the somewhat inaccurate count of my macros. Otherwise, I‚Äôll keep using it because I‚Äôm seeing results already!

Title: Lifechanging
----------------------------------------------------------
So I will start out by saying, I did not mean to get the premium account for this app. BUT I am so grateful that I did (everything happens for a reason)!! This app is SO easy to use! They have recipes that are actually AMAZING! and easy to make (not with a million weird ingredients that you‚Äôve never heard of lol) and it has this ‚Äúsmart camera‚Äù which you take a photo of your meal and it figures out the amount of calories, cholesterols, sugars, and so on!! GREAT FOR EATING OUT!! And I have lost 3 pounds and this is the first week!

Title: Best Nutrition Tracking App EVER!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is the best app for tracking not just calories but nutrition! You can see your macronutrients, calories and foods for the day. Very easy to find any foods you have eaten in their database. Also LOVE that they give you an option to be on meal plans and rank your day based on the plan. For example, I eat low carb so I'm on their Keto diet program that way it tells me when I've eaten too many carbs. Most apps will only tell you the standard American diet recommendations, but this one has multiple options! Highly recommend!

Title: One of the best trackers available
----------------------------------------------------------
Ease of use is an understatement. You can scan items into your daily log. Track and understand how your food choices are meeting criteria for your chosen diet. Recipes are ok, could use more on the daily feed or a database to directly access anytime, include shopping list too! Easy to log exercise and water intake. Add foods or recipes if the library doesn't have it. Never had a functioning problem, this app opens and works perfect every time. I strongly recommend to anyone who wants to track their food and exercise. Thank you!

Title: seamless programing, great interface
----------------------------------------------------------
I really enjoy this app and cannot wait for more updates. They listen to all of the feedback you submit and I have never been so satisfied with a digital food diary. I mean they even have the activity calorie count for body pump! The database will soon grow, but I have put in plenty of foods already so Im not complaining. I love how you can track calories, point, grams of carbs and just about anything. I have waited two months to write this review so I really hope you take my advice and look no further for another diet program.

Title: First Time User
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi Lifesum, I was referred to you from Nike Training Club! I love all the colorful images/illustrations and how seamless your app is (from my 1st day experiencing it). Is it possible to make a meal plan for ‚Äúcarb cycling‚Äù? As a personal trainer, I‚Äôve come into contact with a lot of body competitors and experienced coaches who stay carb cycling but I don‚Äôt think I understand it well enough to apply it to my own eating. Or is it perhaps already part of some of your plans and just not highlighted in the descriptions of the plans?

Title: Teaches you how to eat correctly
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm kind of ashamed that as a 29 year old guy I had trouble keeping track of meals and making sure I ate enough food. I work on the computer a lot but I'm also physically active, this app makes eating good well-balanced diet a lot easier. It helps, it has become such a habit and helps me keep on top of my calorie and nutrient intake. I highly recommend Lifesum if you want to step away from eating so much processed or junk foods, the food ratings make decisions a lot easier and helps reaffirm my food choices throughout the day.

Title: Feature recommendation for Recipes
----------------------------------------------------------
Love this app so much! It‚Äôs helped me so much on my weight loss journey. One feature I wish the app could include is the ability to customize recipes. Sometimes I don‚Äôt have all the ingredients for a recipe, or maybe I would rather not eat a certain ingredient like bacon, I would still want to be able to track the accurate food items I‚Äôve eaten in my meal. There should be an option to check off optional ingredients and calculate the updated calories and nutrient intake. I think that would make life so much easier on the app!!

Title: Easy, informative
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm usually not good at maintaining any diary, but Lifesum makes it easy.  I haven‚Äôt used the camera successfully yet, but I have found comparable foods in the app.  I like that the app incorporates information from my Apple Watch; less info for me to enter.  Having actual metrics available at any time is enlightening.  It‚Äôs easy to think I‚Äôm doing well with my diet, but Lifesum provides me with real data.  It also gives little tidbits and supportive comments throughout the day for encouragement and education.  Glad I got it.

Title: Love it, but...
----------------------------------------------------------
I enjoy this app much more than myfitnesspal because you have the option to measure your food in grams which works for my lifestyle. However I would like more options and customization when it comes to setting goals and counting macros. Sometimes the diet and percentages don't match the goals Im trying to reach and would like to set my macros in grams per day. Also would like a tab to view the entire day and sum of all the macro and micro nutrients like myfitnesspal does so I know how many macros I have, or don't have left.

Title: Lifesum
----------------------------------------------------------
So easy to use!!! Motivating!!! Fast, no searching around trying to add foods.  Scanner speeds  thing up.   Love it!  I am losing weight with it.   This is the best I have ever used.    I like it better than weight watchers.   Wish it had more exercises but I manage with what the have.! Do not upgrade.   It is very inaccurate on its grading method of foods. Same item can be entered twice with different values.  Tap water is a bad choice because of too much sodium, salad dressing,  very poor guidance on which to choose.

Title: It definitely helps
----------------------------------------------------------
It‚Äôs just a new simple and effective tool for weight loss or maintenance. The app is easy to use and it encourages you to stay within your calorie limit and gives a good breakdown of the nutritional value of the foods you‚Äôre eating. I also like the ability to enter almost any exercise you‚Äôre doing and have those calories added to your daily allowance. The water reminders are also a definite aid for me. I‚Äôm never drinking as much as I should. I still don‚Äôt- but I don‚Äôt go a day anymore without several glasses of water.
