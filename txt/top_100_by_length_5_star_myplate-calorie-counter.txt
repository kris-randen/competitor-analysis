Title: Tracking hubby DM diet
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi, my hubby is a diabetic who takes pills for his DM. He got discouraged last year and had quit watching his diet and last month when he saw the MD his A1C was 11.5. MD wanted to start insulin but hubby is one of the people who refuse ‚Äúto live on a needle‚Äù.  I gave him a choice either do a diet with my help or the shot plus a few choice words. I am a retired RN and I‚Äôve been giving him advice to help but he was even refusing my help. I downloaded this app and I had used another app a few years ago that was still on my phone. I tracked his diet for 2 days and showed him how much he was eating. 3-4,000 was his normal day. After my ultimatum he agreed to follow a 2000 calorie diet. When I plugged age 60, ht. 5‚Äô10‚Äù, wt. 198 in with his work activity of moderate it showed him needing 2100 +. We went to store together and I made him help pick out stuff instead of me doing it all. Once home I spent afternoon cutting, chopping, and prefixing salads and diving meat into individual freezer bowls. He is even helping to pack his breakfast and snacks to take to work with him. This past week he has done really well and has not strayed. He is down to 193 and staying at 2,000-2,100 calories. He likes seeing the graph that he is in our goal range. His fasting finger stick was 317 the first time he rechecked and this am it was down to 246. He is tickled and I am thrilled. I got a couple of books in DM foods and he actually looked at one and was making comments and suggestions so we are in the right track for first time in year and a half. This app had really helped him. Thank you!

Title: Love this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I started with Noom but tracking my food was the only part of that program that seemed useful to me and I didn‚Äôt like it much even for that. With Noom there were a lot of clicks required and irritating pop up messages following every single food entry. So I decided to for search for a free app just to track food. Next I tried MyFitnessPal. That lasted less than a day. Then I tried MyPlate. I‚Äôve been using it for about a week and I‚Äôm loving it. It‚Äôs easy to use, clean interface, minimal junk, ads, or other annoyances. Plus it has features I didn‚Äôt even know I wanted like showing how close my intake tracks to my goal percentages for each macronutrient. The goals are also nicely customizable. I‚Äôve already lost a couple pounds. Now I‚Äôve signed up for one of their meal plans which is something I wasn‚Äôt even considering before trying the app. I‚Äôm super happy to have a grocery list of healthy foods all prepared for me (big time and effort saver there) and to try some new recipes this coming week. My only request would be if they could offer the option to double or quadruple recipe quantities since I‚Äôm cooking for a family. But obviously I can do that myself. At the price of free this thing is a heck of a deal. 5 stars. Update: The first day‚Äôs meal plan arrived. The meals didn‚Äôt appeal to me so I‚Äôm probably not going to do that after all. Still loving the app though.

Title: Husband lost 70 lbs just tracking calories
----------------------------------------------------------
I was using a different app that my PT was using. I told my husband to get an app like this. Once he got MyPlate and he was tracking his calories he realized more of what he was eating. He was better able to avoid foods that were full of empty calories and keeping track of his foods helped him see what was making him sick and what didn‚Äôt. It tracks carbs, sugars, fats, sodium, and proteins. (More than this but that‚Äôs all we use). Once he realized how much he was actually eating he started making better choices a little at a time. He wanted to see how much he could lose before he started working out and he quickly lost 60lbs. He found that he was eating more than 10,000 empty calories before. Now he keeps it to under 2,000net calories. (It subtracts calories burnt that are tracked with his iWatch- I have an iFITNESS. Which is much cheaper and it syncs to this app as well). He loves it. It‚Äôs like a game to him.  I tell everyone about this app because I‚Äôm so proud of him. Literally, all the motivation he needed was to be shown how much garbage he was eating. Now, because he‚Äôs eating less processed sugar, his sores heal faster, he‚Äôs off his gout medication,($200/month) and we‚Äôre hoping he‚Äôll be off his bp meds next visit. His teeth are in better condition without all the soda. He can‚Äôt even stand to eat all the junk because it makes him sick. LOVE THIS APP!

Title: Saving my future
----------------------------------------------------------
Before I had gotten this app, I seriously didn't feel confident in what I was eating at all. This is is saving me and here's why. I'm 14. Before you start yapping about how I shouldn't be dieting and blah blah blah, I have very good reasons so try to hear me out. Both of my parents have very bad health and struggle with their weight a lot. Cancer runs in the family pretty strongly, and my father has hearth issues. My mom is always in pain in her joints and we are pretty sure she has a type of arthritis. I'm currently 158 pounds which is a lot- especially for my age. If I continue eating the way I do, living the way I do, or drinking as little as I do now...I could potentially not live a long healthy life. If I eat healthy and I workout everyday and try to drink 80 oz of water, I think I would actually be a healthy human. Will it stop me from cancer, arthritis, and blood pressure issues? Maybe not, but when you are healthy and living a healthy lifestyle, I believe you have a bigger chance in survival. I have been using this app everyday for about a week and it makes me really happy to say that I am losing weight as we speak! My skin looks really nice and I am finally feeling confident in my body. I am so happy to have this app, it's a life changer and a life beginner. I love that it doesn't have pop up ads either. Thank you creators ‚ú®üíõ‚ú®.

Title: Awesome awesome app
----------------------------------------------------------
I always cringed at my dr saying chart food & exercise as I am 5' 1" & 207 # & diabetic, my goal is 150#! Much healthier for me & make it easier to do everyday things, including mounting my horses, amazing how hard it is to pull this extra weight up that far, especially since I got a new one that's taller than my head at her back! This all has led to my inspiration to track & lose weight to be healthier!  This app is wonderful & inspiring as I walk around seeing my calories melt as my iPhone tracks me, then I put in my bathroom I just cleaned and wow, I'm negative calories right now!  Almost lunch time so I'll scan or punch what I eat in and drink (water is such nice with its own button!) My dr is gonna love me next month! Maybe I'll break down & go buy a scale to track my weight now! This really let's you see the breakdown and makes it simple to see your protein to carbs ratio too! It's been rainy here the last few days since I loaded this & off work for weekend/holiday can't wait to see what I do on normal days at work & weekends on the farm! I imported this data to my iPhone health app as well to show with my daily mileage and pedometer count! So freaking awesome! So far for a week every day average is 2 miles a day just going about work & chores no exercise getting ready to implement that in!  Everyone Good Luck on your journey!

Title: Absolutely The Best Food Tracking App
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried every food tracking app out there and MyPlate is hands down the best. Similar to other apps you can search your food or scan a barcode and have the nutrition information auto fill in. If it isn‚Äôt there, you can always manually add it in too. To be honest though, there are some things that the app won‚Äôt recognize by bar code but almost 90% of those things are your local grocery store self made products and not big name brand products they stock on shelves. The app also has a macronutrient tracker which absolutely imperative when you are trying to lose weight. Other apps make you pay for that feature but MyPlate offers it for free!! The app also offers some healthy food recipes that correlate to how many calories you have left in any particular day should you choose to use them. I have not tried the meal plan so I cannot comment on that. MyPlate also lets you set your goal weight and how many pounds you want to lose per week, which is something other apps allow too but just so you know that feature is also here. Like I outlined above, the app though is absolutely perfect and worth more than 5 stars for being free. I‚Äôve lost 45 pounds so far and have another 30 to go and couldn‚Äôt have done it without this app.

Title: Great app! Even without purchasing the subscription
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is great! I have been overweight for the last 20 years and I never thought that I would be able to lose the weight.  I downloaded this app with pretty low expectations. After using it for a few days and seeing everything that it helps you keep track of, I was addicted. Between accurately tracking my caloric intake with this app, and eating minimal processed foods, I have lost 40 lbs in about two and a half months and I am officially in a healthy weight range again! You can set a goal of how much weight you want to lose (or gain) and it will show you your daily calorie goal. It has a great graphing function that will help you keep track of progress for the last year. It tracks your daily calories, weight, BMI, carb intake, sugar intake, and so much more. Watching the line on the graph go down for the last few months has really kept me motivated. I couldn‚Äôt have lost the weight without using this app. If you are serious about keeping track of your diet and becoming healthier, I highly recommend the free download. I‚Äôm still using the free version, but I am so impressed with the results, I am going to purchase it tonight to see all of the other stats that I can track.

Title: Love it.
----------------------------------------------------------
The app is helping me lose weight by helping me count carbs.  At first I was using the free version just to count calories.  I was doing great in the calorie department, but my weight wasn‚Äôt changing much.  I dug a bit deeper, and thanks to the other features of the app I realized I was eating carbs mostly.  The app opened my eyes to the macros, and I did more research online.  I limited my carbs intake to under 50%, and mind you, I hadn‚Äôt been eating candy, cakes, cookies or snacks before, my weight started dropping off at about two pounds per week.  The app taught me that there are carbs in beans and vegetables, and that I need to pay attention to the macros in all the foods, including those that I had thought healthy options; my vegan home cooked meals were packed with carbs.  By balancing my diet better, I actually started feeling better almost immediately.  The fogginess is gone, I have energy, I don‚Äôt drag myself from task to task, and I‚Äôm at my lowest weight in years, and my BMI is normal.  I will reach my weight goal in a couple of weeks.  I am eating differently, and I don‚Äôt miss my old food habits. I don‚Äôt crave sugar.  I feel good.  Thank you, App!

Title: Best Calorie and Nutrient Counter App Available
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app for several months now (perhaps a year‚ÄîI cannot remember date I first started), and I find it to be not only the best app but the easiest app for quickly maintaining a log of my daily intake of calories and nutrients. Not only does it allow one to look up items easily by typing their names, but it has a fantastic barcode scanner that will automatically enter the calorie and nutrient. data from the barcode after scanning the code. This allows one quickly to adjust only the portion/servings eaten and be finished. It works extremely well even though not every brand is in its database. Never fear, however, one may add the food to the one‚Äôs own food database, and then it will be available for the next time it is eaten. One may also create special recipes or meal items and add those to one‚Äôs own food database such that all the facts are there for easy entry for on a subsequent use. Moreover, when eating out, one can look up foods in chain restaurants, and they will often already be a part of the food database contained in the app‚Äîan added bonus that makes the app even easier to use.

Title: It depends on YOU! Do the WORK!
----------------------------------------------------------
I lost 70 lbs with the online version of this app years ago. Now I'm more on the go and not to add gained all my weight back and some. The LiveStrong app is really convenient. This application allows for users to track their calorie intake, (especially important for those seeking to loose weight), water, weight, bmi, etc. If I had to give constructive criticism on this app I would say that the daily water intake doesn't allow for mistakes to be corrected. I accidentally put in that I drank 824 oz of water and  there was no way of changing it.  The reminders that you can set for this app also comes in handy. Not to mention the food library is amazing. You can even scan items.  Most other apps like this one you have to manually enter a lot of foods you eat. LiveStrong has almost everything in its food tracker, everything down to 5 star restaurants to the local burger joint, and fresh fruits and vegetables. I recommend this app to make a long story short. It could improve in certain areas but what doesn't need improvements these day. üòä

Title: Ideas to make it better
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app I would track my calories by hand before and this just makes it better and easier. I would love if you had an option to pay yearly not just monthly for the gold plan because if you add that I will defiantly do the gold plan. I would be good if you did like a silver and bronze plan too that have other options. Also you should add a ** drink water remind** where we can have it remind us a few times a day. And it would be cool if we could have friends through the app and see each others calories and support each other because I do this with my mom but we have to go over calories when we‚Äôre together because I can‚Äôt just add her like a friend. Another idea in the meal prep you should have a weeks worth of recipes when you click that tab and you could change them every week. You could do it for the gold of course. Hope you read this post and get back to me. I really would love to see some of these updates it would make the app better and the pay by year would be perfect not everyone likes having another monthly bill.

Title: Excellent app
----------------------------------------------------------
Update  3/12/16:    They did an upgrade a few days ago that seemed to break some things.  After contacting them about it, they responded very quickly and resolved the problem. THANK YOU AND GOOD JOB!   I'll stick with the 5 star rating.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: After discovering that I had Type 2 diabetes, I downloaded this app to track consumed sugar and calories.  I'm now hook on this app.  I use it whenever I eat anything and love the ability to scan food labels.  Although it seems to have a huge database of food items, I sometimes have trouble deciding which of the identically named items I'm eating, e.g., "Medium Apple" at 80 calories or "Medium Apple" at 90 calories (this is a minor complaint).  The other issue is whether the proper adjustment is made to accumulated sugar for eating partial portions - I read someplace that this wasn't handled correctly, but I haven't checked this myself.  I also like the integration with the HEART app.  Allowing a daily entry for measured blood sugar would be interesting.

Title: Amazing
----------------------------------------------------------
The best thing about this app is that it is simple and easy to use. I‚Äôve been lifting seriously for the past year and went through a bulking phase where I went from 178 to 205 in a little over 6 months, in large part due to this app. A lot of the things I had been eating before using this app I didn‚Äôt know the exact makeup of the food I was intaking and with this app it helped me so much. So many other apps I tried for my meal prepping wanted to give me different things to eat and to try this and that, when all I wanted was something that could track my calories, carbs, protein, and fat intake. It was a blessing to have this. The ‚Äúmy food‚Äù part of this makes it quick and easy when, like many competitive powerlifters, you‚Äôre on a strict diet and eat the same foods at the same time every day for weeks on end. Now that I‚Äôm in the cutting phase again, I set my calorie intake level that I want, and I can track it throughout the day. Overall, amazing for those who do dieting seriously like I do.

Title: Personal chef/nutrition consultant
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app! I lost over 100 pounds several years ago with careful portioning and living a heart-healthy lifestyle. I have kept the weight off for over 6 years, but this past winter I put on about 5 pounds. I knew I needed to track my food carefully to see where I was adding extra calories and this app has helped so much! I was eating a few too many servings of healthy fats such as nuts and seeds I realized after tracking carefully. Now I am using the app to help me visually plan my daily meal plan instead of in my journal as I had previously. I am creating a calorie deficiency to cause a weight loss by carefully watching my portions and limiting my healthy fats more than I was. This has already caused me to drop the excess pounds over just 2 weeks! This is a wonderful tool. I wish I had it years ago when I started journaling on my journey to losing over 100 pounds, it would have saved me so much time vs. writing everything down and then looking up calories! Thanks so much!

Title: MUST HAVE
----------------------------------------------------------
I recently started a diet/workout program which I've often quit before but this app has kept me on top of things longer than I was able to on my own. Documenting your meals, and being able to keep track of calories, makes everything feel that much more official. It REALLY discourages quitting. Uber user-friendly; if you're not sure which item to choose for your food, simply scan the barcode and voil√†! Everything about this app is extremely useful. I even recommend the water app that is linked to it (MyWater) to keep track of daily water intake as well. MyPlate even has a neat little chart to visually represent your activity throughout days, weeks, and months. Last but not least, it links to the pre-installed Health app on iPhone and uses that information to determine how many calories you have burned, not to mention that you can manually add exercises you have done to add to the calorie burning. For anyone wishing to live a healthier lifestyle, this app is IT!!!

Title: By far one of the most useful apps I have on my phone!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
So I‚Äôm starting a calorie deficit to try and lose some weight and this app is perfect for calculating calories. I‚Äôm also trying to stick to a 50:30:20 meal plan when it comes to carbs, proteins, and fats. It gives me a percentage of each for every meal I have and a total at the end of the day. I can enter my calorie goal and it will tell me how many calories I have left for each day. It also has other features I didn‚Äôt even know I needed but now rely on, like different articles addressing an assortment of nutritional topics or an entire meal plan where is gives you healthy recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. By far my favorite health & nutrition app I‚Äôve ever used. I‚Äôve tried MyFitnessPal, Noom, Weight Watchers, and MyPlate is by far my favorite and most useful. It also has little to no ad interferences so I‚Äôm never interrupted by them! Overall, 100% recommend it to anyone who wants to keep track of their calories and nutrition!

Title: New to iPhone
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm not new to technology but new to the handiness of iPhone apps. This app is great! It is really easy and streamlined to use, which is my main requirement for any app. Food choices are perfect for foods a person would find in the States, though I wish I could find more approximations for exotic and foreign dishes that we cook at home. I never used to count calories regularly because of the dedication it took- logging on, researching, recording, adding, subtracting from limits, etc. iPhone + this app= no reason to go over calorie limits. Hard to be that lazy! Note- I wish there was a way to add onto yesterday's info without having to do the dance of going to diary, yesterday, +, meals/exercise. If there was a way to just flip back to that on the main page where i add on to today's cals, and have the same easy page setup as that, that would be great, especially since I often don't log dinner until after midnight.

Title: Really easy
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is really easy to use and it‚Äôs also very visually appealing to the eye with your proteins and such being colorcoded so you know to pay attention! The only thing I would suggest to improve is the comment section and the sugar intake system. It would be nice if there was a reply button to other people‚Äôs comments in the community to make things easier to write and read. It‚Äôs kind of just a bunch of comments and to understand what people are talking about you‚Äôd have to read ALL of the comments instead of just the reply section or the original comment that was replied to. It would also be nice if the sugars could be separated from added sugars so it can be clear how much added sugar we should be eating and how much natural sugars we should be eating. As a fruit lover, I love eating my fruits with a low-calorie dip but it‚Äôs super hard to tell if I‚Äôm going over my added sugars or my natural sugars.

Title: Loving it more & more...BUT...
----------------------------------------------------------
There's only 2 small things I really have 2 complain, or should I say..mention. 1. When i enter something under any section of meals it puts it down & it goes either my foods or my meals, wherever I put it. But if notice a mistake there's only 1 way to fix it. & that's edit it. There's no way to completely delete it & start over. I noticed that several things are listed exactly the same like 50 x's under my foods as well & there is no way to delete all but 1 of the entries. Under my meals are a few entries that were done when I was 1st learning & I would really like to delete them. But like I said, there's no way, at least not that I know of . The only thing I've been able 2 delete are entries under that day 4 each meal or snack , exercise, etc... Would looovvveeee it if u could make deleting items possible from my foods or my meals. I have 2 enter a lot of what I eat manually & mistakes happen.

Title: Great community, free, customizable
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has a great community, everyone is incredibly supportive, helpful, and welcoming. There is a free version of the app, and a "gold" version that you pay for. I have the free version, and it includes all the features and functions I need/want. This is a vast improvement from a different app I tied, which marketed itself as free, yet didn't let you even enter meals without paying for the "pro" version. MyPlate is very easy to use, and you can customize your daily calorie, macronutrient (carbs, protein, fat), sodium, cholesterol, sugar, and dietary fiber goals. You can also set these to automatic, and it calculates daily goals based on height, weight, activity level, long-term goal (gain, lose, or maintain weight), and other factors. Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a free, comprehensive nutrition tracker with a great community you can go to for help and support.

Title: Beneficial to my weight loss and muscle gain.
----------------------------------------------------------
In July of 2018 I was 204. That kind of weight on my 5‚Äô7‚Äù frame was not good or healthy. I began exercising and was struggling to notice any loss of weight. I heard about MyPlate and began tracking my calories. Being able to monitor my Proteins, Carbs, and Fats allowed me to know exactly what I was getting from one meal to the next. By being able to see if I was meeting my daily macro nutrient goals allowed me to adjust my nutrition accordingly and the weight began to almost fall off. One week I decided to measure everything on a scale to input exactly what my caloric intake was. Not that I would recommend this for everyone or for any consistent time, but in that week I lost at least a pound a day and still felt energized due to getting exactly what was needed for my body to lose weight and still maintain action. I do recommend this app to anyone looking to lose weight and/or gain mass.

Title: Perfect app
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used this app for years and love it. I recently tried a different app and was nowhere near as pleased. I decided to get curious, however, and look into upgrading to a Gold account. This was the first time I was ever displeased with this app and my issue was because of ethics rather than functionality. They tell you how much a Gold Account is per month and when you press "buy" they try to hit your account for the whole year's fees when it is clearly implied that you will be paying a small amount monthly. Not a huge deal. It was still a good price. I just cannot stand trickery and dishonesty. Why not just say that a Gold account costs so much per year? Or, if you're going to quote it by the month, charge that quoted fee monthly? Anyway, I'm still happy with the app and may upgrade to Gold soon despite my being put off by the company's unethical procedure in that regard.

Title: Great app for tracking!
----------------------------------------------------------
I really enjoy using this tracker, even with just the free version. The aesthetic is very nice to me compared to MFP. I like that you are able to connect your fitness tracker (Apple Watch for me) and I also like that it has meal recommendations depending on your goals. I love that you are able to put in your own food if it‚Äôs not listed and build your own meals so you can add all of its contents at once, making tracking oatmeal and smoothies and my other favorite food concoctions much easier. Only downside is that you can‚Äôt track only a portion of the meals if you make more than one serving (for example I made muffins and input all the ingredients I used into a meal, until I saw I would only be able to track eating the whole batch rather than 1/6 of the meal). Besides that, I like that there‚Äôs a notification option and how you can schedule daily reminders to track.

Title: My New Normal
----------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely love this app! It‚Äôs like breathing to me now, I eat something and immediately log it in. It‚Äôs so simple because you can search for whatever food you ate and if it‚Äôs not already on there, you can create it. If you only eat half of something, you can adjust serving size. I log my weight, workouts (by exercise) and amount of water I drink as well. It‚Äôs also super convenient for logging combo workouts you‚Äôve done because you can enter ‚Äúcalories burned‚Äù and the name of the workout. I‚Äôve lost 13 pounds and four inches off my waist already because of this app and I don‚Äôt plan to ever stop using it! You can use the entire function of the app without paying anything for a gold membership, aside from a few workout videos (which I don‚Äôt use anyway. I get mine from YouTube.) I highly recommend this for anyone trying to lose weight and get their summer body. A++

Title: Love it!
----------------------------------------------------------
Years ago I got my degree in dietetics. However, five kids later I found that the pounds had snuck up over the years. I was exercising and eating nutritious foods for the most part, but still wasn't losing weight. That's when I got back to the basics and started using this app to determine calories in and calories out.  I was able to set a weight goal and am working towards it. I have had great results, and I feel like this is something I can do.  I plan to use it daily for a month until I use a few pounds and then adjust the calories for the next month to maintain.  I do not plan on using it daily long term.  I think it is helpful to bring attention to how many calories one is eating comparatively.  I like that it breaks it breaks down the intake of macronutrients, but I wish that it also showed micronutrients consumed.  Overall, it is a great tool to use.

Title: Why I like Livestrong's calorie tracker
----------------------------------------------------------
Super easy to use! Reminds me to enter my weight every morning. Adding what I eat is quick, one thumb nav. What I love is seeing how many carbs, protein and fat grams for meals before I eat them as well as throughout day if my carbs are high I can choose to eat more protein and know to skip the bread in order to balance out the whole day. One thing the free app earns you ten reward points every time you use a daily feature like adding a food item. At first the notices annoyed me but then I realized all those points add up to cash gift cards. So now it fun to count my calories, earn reward points and can you imagine my new me Xmas pics to all my friends next year when I have lost all this weight and using my reward points to go on vacation? I support Livestrong and Lance Armstrong because we all fall down but getting up makes us a champion!

Title: Exercise
----------------------------------------------------------
Good and helpful. It is hard to realize what your calorie intake should be,but changing keeps you on track. I really like it doesn't cost and basically it does the same as weight watchers. It is hard work dieting but I like the fact I can still eat the things I like without going overboard. I am tired of the roller coaster ride of dieting at my age and once I get to my target weight all I will do is maintain it so I don't go crazy again. I like the rewards you can get from all the sponsor and that gives me an extra incentive to work at it harder. I have also learn to make time to walk even if I am tired at the end of the day. Not to thrilled about drinking water all the time but I do add tea once in awhile and it does take off on my calorie intake. All exercises are not listed but that can be dealt with by finding close to what you do.

Title: Full five stars
----------------------------------------------------------
My dad lost 80 lbs using this and for the first time kept them off. Just got diagnosed with fatty liver so I need to loose the weight to avoid complications. I figured if it worked for him I could try it myself. I am a week into using this for portion control along with exercise and I am down 4 lbs this week!!! The ability to eat whatever you want is the key. No morale busting horrible tasting newspaper trimming food. Just control portions of the good stuff. Combine this with iHealth counting steps, and an exercise bike the gives a calorie count, and I have a baseline that lets me eat and if I go over the -2 lb/week calorie count, I know just how long I need to pedal to get back on track. The barcode scan is also a plus for home food prep. Off to get a decent food scale now to aid in portioning. Can‚Äôt recommend this app enough.

Title: Great app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like how easy it is to track food, nutritions, weight, and progress of your eating habits with this app! If you need something to help you keep an eye on all of these things, this is your app! The only "con" is that although the data available for common foods is great, you might not find exactly what you are and have to enter the information manually. A great way to do this is to just split up your meal and enter the items individually (e.g. Cooked vegetables, cooked shrimp, rice, and sauce - as opposed to looking for "steamed vegetables with shrimp"). My favorite thing about this app is that you can go back and look at the previous days, add things, in case you forgot something, or simply see what you did that day to evaluate your progress along the way. I also love that you can track your exercise at the same time!

Title: App changed my life
----------------------------------------------------------
My doctor gave me the bad news that my blood pressure was high, my cholesterol was high, was prediabetic, And surprise-surprise... I was overweight. Time to make a change. I started using this app to track my food and get a clear understanding of how I was eating and exercising. Committing to inputting the information was not easy for the first few days but it became a habit. I am down 20% of my original weight and all of the negative information my doctor gave me has been addressed and there‚Äôs no longer a problem. My Apple Watch syncs my activity to the app seamlessly and helps me really understand what I‚Äôve been up to and give me motivation to do a little bit better every day. The real change comes with you, the person using the app, but this app unlocked clarity of understanding and discipline that I‚Äôve never had before.

Title: Best free calorie tracking app by far
----------------------------------------------------------
I haven‚Äôt tried any of the paid features, but even the free options allow me to track both meals & water, which is more than most other free apps I downloaded. The design is simple and makes sense. I also participate in a meal kit service which supplies nutritional facts for each meal; this app makes it easy to enter those facts and track and chart those calories & macros. No better free app for this - I checked all the apps recommended by Apple HealthKit. Apps that looked slightly better usually had a cost for the app itself, and/ or anywhere from $10-$40 monthly fee. At $10 for a single month, $5/mo for 6 months, or $3.75/mo for a year, the Gold membership may well be worth it. Having so many free resources in an app is really heartening; I might upgrade to gold just to support this app & it‚Äôs developers. Thank you.

Title: Great, but could be even better!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve really enjoyed using this app, and it‚Äôs really easy to use. The only issue I have found is the amount of inaccuracies in the stored food information. It would be really cool to have a user rating system to help verify the information of the foods listed. For example, users could upvote or downvote certain foods based on accuracy. Also, there should be a way to report/give feedback on foods that have incorrect information. I have found that even some of the ‚Äúverified‚Äù foods are wrong. For example, I compared the information from the package to the information on the app from the bacon that I had this morning. The app had the nutritional information for raw bacon listed instead of cooked. Who eats raw bacon? The same thing happens with boxed foods that have the unprepared and prepared calories listed.

Title: Easy and effective
----------------------------------------------------------
This app works because of its simplicity and its persistence. It is easy because I don‚Äôt have to look up a bunch of recipes or nutritional values. Most everything I eat is already on a list I select. Even the junk food.  It is persistent through reminders that make it almost impossible to ignore. I started by tracking everything I ate without trying to change anything. This gave me a few weeks of data showing all my bad habits. Even after drinking cokes and eating way too much Chick Fil A, I found myself staying under my calorie goal. My calories burned are easy to enter by selecting items from a list such as my favorites ‚Äî walking the dog and gardening. After establishing a routine of using the app, I started focusing more on the nutrition values. I have only used the basic free version of the app.

Title: This just might save my life!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app not only makes counting calories easy but really fun too! I have never understood counting calories but with this simple, user friendly app I can do it in a snap! I am morbidly obese and need to make a drastic change immediately so we went looking for something like this, I described exactly what I needed to my friend and he found this app first on the list. I cannot believe how easy it is! You can look up brand names and even restaurants and find accurate caloric, serving, and carb info, and it tracks your exercise and activities too.  But most importantly, it tracks your water consumption. That is huge for me!  Using this app is going to change my life and quite possibly save it in the process. I am so pleased and excited for finding this wonderfully helpful app! Thank you Livestrong!

Title: Great for macro counters
----------------------------------------------------------
Counting macros is a challenge. Just trying to figure out what percentage you should have based on your body and life is like trying to remember my college calculus classes. This app does it all for you and it is amazing! We moved abroad to Europe, and finding a routine and healthy eating given all of the new products was really hard. I gained 8-10 pounds and no matter what I did I could not get rid of it. I had a sense that macro proportions were the key, and sure enough...weight is coming off. I use the scanner and the auto populate is magnificent. I exercise heavily and the app adds those calories back, but I‚Äôm sticking to the low end of 1200 calories to lose quickly. Definitely worth the premium membership to get at some wonderful recipes full of flavor. Thanks for the best app ever!

Title: Great Calorie Tracker
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using the free version. I've learned over the years that the best way for me to lose weight is to track my caloric intake. This app is fantastic at doing just that. Once you start with the settings and the amount of weight you'd like to lose each week tracking what you eat is simple. There's a vast database of nutritional info and if you can't find it on their database you can enter it manually or scan the UPC code. It sure beats writing stuff down on pieces of paper and looking up the nutritional data in a book or online. It also enables you to account for you fitness regimen as it automatically subtracts calories according to the type of exercise you do. This is a great, easy to use app! You're also not constantly bombarded with requests to upgrade to the premium version.

Title: App is pretty great, but can only measure 100 grams of food?
----------------------------------------------------------
So the app pretty much has everything I want. I like the food selection, make your own food feature, weight tracking, progress view etc, it‚Äôs all great. There is 1 problem that is major though (for non US people). The grams parameter in the food serving size is limited to 100. People who use metric (everyone in the world except US) have to convert grams to ounces if a serving you eat is over 100 grams. This is actually a pretty lame limitation, since 100 grams is only 3.5 ounces. The reason I‚Äôm using this app in the first place is so I don‚Äôt have to calculate and convert calories myself, so having to convert to ounces is inconvenient. The app is otherwise better than all the other apps I‚Äôve tried, so I‚Äôm gonna keep using it. But it would literally be perfect without this limitation.

Title: Thank you so much.
----------------------------------------------------------
Without this app I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve lost what I did. I weighed 201lbs at 5‚Äù7 about a couple months after quarantine had begun. I tried multiple times to lose weight but I always went back and gained it all. I decided that I needed to do something about it. I researched and most websites said that a good tracker helped a lot of people. I said ‚Äú What the heck‚Äù and went to the AppStore and searched up food tracker. I downloaded many but basically all except this one made me pay for a bunch of the basic services. When I found this app I told myself I‚Äôd try it because it didn‚Äôt make me pay to open it lol. Now I weigh 175.7 lbs still at 5‚Äù7. Thank you very much! I am going to continue losing until I reach 160lbs. Then I will continue using it to maintain my weight. Thanks a ton!

Title: Makes weight loss easy!
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using this app about a month ago because the wedding dress I bought almost a year ago for my September wedding no longer fit. This app is amazing. By entering basic information like height, weight, and goal, it calculates how many calories I can eat a day to reach my goal. It makes me accountable for everything I eat. It has been an educational experience to learn how many calories are in certain food items and has helped me to make healthier choices. I have not been hungry at all by filling up on healthier food choices while still allowing myself an occasional treat.The barcode scan feature is a wonderful. In just about a months time I am down 15 pounds. My dress not only fits, I might need it taken in by the wedding. As a bonus, I feel healthier and have more energy!

Title: Amazing app! But..
----------------------------------------------------------
I really enjoy how easy it is to track calories and macros with this app. It‚Äôs helped me become so aware of what foods are healthy for me and which aren‚Äôt so healthy. I suggest unlinking any device that you have connected (I had my Apple Watch connected) because it gives you unrealistic calorie burn stats that increase your daily caloric intake... for me I just prefer manually inputting any exercise I did. Something else I would add would be the possibility of changing the calories/macros some products have. You can only change the serving size but there are times when it‚Äôs inaccurate. You should be able to edit how much calories a food has like on MyFitnessPal. Overall though, I like this layout so much more. It‚Äôs helped me lose over 10 lbs in a little over a month!

Title: Great app if your serous
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm not new to fitness and diet. I have been training and counting macros for over 10years.  I‚Äôve also set up meal plans and gotten great results but now I‚Äôm trying the Keto diet. I wasn‚Äôt use to eating so much fat I I needed an app to count my macros for me and check percentages so I can make sure I‚Äôm eating enough fat and not going over on my protein. I two weeks I‚Äôve lost 4lb which weight loss was not my intention when starting this diet but I can say that all the weight I‚Äôve lost have been water and fat. I‚Äôve seen an incredible amount of definition around my lower stomach and lower back. This app has made it very easy for me to follow my diet and I‚Äôll make it easy for anyone else trying to follow a diet regardless of what kind of diet they want to follow.

This app is incredible and it supports you in losing weight or gaining weight(muscle). Theres a great community of people on the app that help you out with any questions you have and they support you. I've finally stuck to a diet thanks to this app and I've lost almost 20 pounds. I feel satisfied when I enter my exercise and watch the calories cancel out. The water app you can get to sync with this app is also amazing and helps keep me hydrated. Definitely worth downloading and its a great app for people who want to keep their New Years resolutions! They do all the math for you and you just enter what you eat and stay within your limit! The graph is awesome and I can see my weight dropping over the course of months and it motivates me to keep going. 10/10.

Title: Be brutally honest with your tracking and this will work
----------------------------------------------------------
It's simple to use, it provides a ton of value for the free version. The database is deep, it's been extremely reliable, but only when you don't cheat! If you can be diligent and brutally honest with your entries, this app will keep you on track and on goal. Over time, thanks to repetition, you'll be able to estimate calories without referencing the app, but KEEP entering everything into the app! It keeps you accountable and that's half the battle, to stay brutally honest and accountable for your calories intake. If you're new to this type of app, expect some upfront time logging food into your favorites/recurring meals, but once they're available, the app makes it super simple to select from those food items and emails again. Updating becomes a breeze.

I love this app! It‚Äôs so easy to use, very organized, and keeps me on track. I love that it breaks all the food down into each part like the fats, carbs and proteins. It has a bar scan reader which is very helpful when eating packaged food. It also lets you build your own meals and you can name them and save them for later use. I also love that it gives you workout exercises and connects to other workout apps (I use Apple Health and Workout for Women) to keep track of calories burned. I have only used this app for a few days but it is one of my favorites. I don‚Äôt have the Gold (yet) but even the free version is amazing. It even keeps track of how much water you are drinking. It‚Äôs kind of fun and like a game which makes it easier to use :) great app

Title: Great for me!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is so helpful for tracking calorie intake and, specifically, what I eat. I really like to know about the protien content of my food, and it shows me how much is in eat serving. I just wish I could track my fiber intake as easily. But for a free version of the app, it's great! I'm not sure how much more useful the paid version would be, but right now I can't afford the $2.99 just to find out if it's any better. Plus, I learned how much I actually eat, I never realized I consumed so many calories, or how much fewer I should eat to stabilize my weight in my lifestyle. I am impressed with how you goal caloric intake is adjusted depended on your actual activity level, as well as what you want to lose or gain or even maintain. Great free app!!

You enter your weight etc and gives options maintain lose gain. What ever your goal then you have feedback to much to little etc. and if you have an activity monitor it adds to the tracking. And if not say you mowed lawn push mower 1/2 hr let‚Äôs you manually enter individual activities and gives a calorie value.

I downloaded this app the summer of my freshman year of college (after the freshman 15 was gained). I became really interested in eating healthy and working out but soon realized I got way to skinny way too fast. I started using this app to make sure that I was staying healthy on my fitness journey and I have not stopped using it since (about 3.5 years). I never needed to purchase the upgrade because the free app had everything I needed. I love the scanner and that it has to option to look up restaurant food as well. Overall amazing app for tracking food but it's much harder to track workouts on the free version. This is fine for me because I'm just using it to make sure that I meet my daily calorie and macronutrient requirements!

Title: Bariatric Surgery Compatible
----------------------------------------------------------
Approximately 18 months ago I began using the free app because of my decision to have Bariatric surgery. It was necessary for me to follow the Bariatric guidelines (3 meals/day, no snacks, 64 oz water, no simple carbs) prior to surgery and this app is perfect. Surgery was last year and I am down 72 lbs. My BP medication was cut in half, plus I had been taking 1500 mg of Metformin for Type II Diabetes for 14 years and now without taking that glucose regulating drug I am free of the disease. My A1C (90 day glucose average) is now 5.4 - NORMAL!!!  MyPlate continues to be a daily help for me. Love being able to track food, water, protein, carbs and exercise right on my iPhone. It keeps me on my healthy living path. Thank you MyPlate!

Title: What I needed!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using this app for 5 days, while using several other calorie counting apps at the same time.  This one was the clear winner for me!  I went ahead and payed for the one year Gold membership since it is working to help me see what I'm consuming, as well as the distribution of protein, fat, and carbs.  This makes it much easier to see where I need to make changes.  I LOVE the scanner for automatic entry of foods!  It doesn't always have them, but it's easy to add a new one and their nutrient value in that case.  I also LOVE that you can make your own meal entries for things consumed often.  I haven't used all of the available resources on the app like community or exercise, but just might once I'm fully used to the app.

This app really works!!! I know it‚Äôs hard to find apps that work and I know the feeling of being over whelmed on which app to chose from. But ‚Äúmy plate‚Äù really works.

At some points you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôve made no progress but trust me, the effects kick in. It‚Äôll take around a month for you to show some progress. The best thing is, I never had to give up any of the foods I love, all I had to do was cut down my food intake. The app is great and it works like a charm üëåüèΩ.

Title: Fantastic!
----------------------------------------------------------
I almost never write reviews, but this app has been extremely helpful in my journey to lose weight and regain my fitness level. I had always eaten very healthy, i.e. very low fat and low sugar diet. And yet I was gaining weight. With this app I discovered that I was just eating too much! So keeping track of what and how much I eat helped me learn much more about healthy nutrition, but I also lost 39 pounds in 4 months (bear in mind, I exercise hard 5-6 times a week). I also love the high-intensity interval training routines the Exercise section has. They were hard to complete for the first couple of months! Great way to really push yourself in 10 minutes. Long story short, one of the best apps I've ever had on my phone.

First off, I‚Äôve been using the MyPlate app for a little over 5 months now and it‚Äôs really helped me make some big positive changes in my life! I‚Äôve always been athletic and in decent shape and I always thought I made pretty smart food choices, but in addition to exercise, MyPlate has helped me lose almost 20 pounds and learn so much more about the food that goes into my body. I love the daily macro breakdown and the ability to customize the app based on your nutritional goals. The forums where you can find user-submitted recipes are also really fun to sift through for some inspiration to shake things up. I‚Äôm in the best mental and physical shape of my life right now and this app has had a huge part in that. I love it!

Title: Largest variety of food of any calorie counter!
----------------------------------------------------------
I signed up for this app in January and basically, at first, I slacked.Recently I got back on the wagon!  Not only do they automatically calculate your daily caloric intake goal based on the profile that you fill out with your height, weight, goal weight, age, and gender. One of the greatest features of this application is the database, which contains a plethora of different of foods . I was quite frankly in shock with all of the choices! Let's face it diet is 70% of weight loss  and exercise is the other 30%. That being said we MUST MUST MUST eat healthy, we must never restrict ourselves or use extreme dieting to lose weight. Bottom line is eat when you're hungry and STOP when you're full! This App is a must have !!

Title: Love it
----------------------------------------------------------
So far, I really like using this app. I had tried it along time ago but it was not quite where I needed it to be. Now is a totally different story, it‚Äôs updates are super useful and I like the set up. It‚Äôs super easy to use and very friendly. It‚Äôs pretty accurate with some adjustments needing to be made but that‚Äôs normal for any app.It is good practice to double check that users are putting in the correct information. I recommend this app for anyone who is looking to track their nutrition and really gain understanding of what they‚Äôre putting in their bodies. For me, I was looking for something simple yet comprehensive, and importantly free with the option to upgrade should I want to. This ticks all the boxes for me.

Title: Wow!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is  an amazing app in every sense of the word. From a technical standpoint the interface and underlying database technology far exceeded my expectations balancing ease of use with an amazing level of sophistication. As an active woman struggling with my weight it provides me with a guilt free honest snapshot of my successes and failures; this app even has info for my vitamins, supplements, and snacks! Not only does it keep me on track at home but I traveled recently to Maine for a job interview. I was able to find 100% of all the items I ate in the airport, room service, and other meals! While I exceeded my daily caloric goals, the app helped me to make healthy choices and not stray too far off the mark!

Title: Love the app...but it has stopped working!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love the app and have been having some success over the last month. However, I can no longer scan barcodes; it gives me an error message and says to check my connection. I cannot enter food manually; it is saying unable to do this now. I cannot enter exercise that I haven‚Äôt done before; it is telling me I‚Äôm not logged in. I cannot enter food that I haven‚Äôt logged before; it says no options are found. I tried logging in to the website online and am unable to do that either. A friend is having the same problems so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just me. Is the website/app down? Is there an update pending. As far as I know I didn‚Äôt change any settings so I‚Äôm not sure why everything has stopped working! Very frustrating!

Title: My favorite food/activity tracking App
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app for 5 months and there are a lot of things I really like about it. I like that I can set my own daily calorie goal, and set my own macro percentage goals within that. I love that it syncs with my Apple Watch to track my activity. The voice search on the Watch app can be frustrating, but it's good for logging water and frequently eaten foods. I like being able to create custom meals, and add foods that aren't in their database (though you should be able to edit foods that you have added - sometime things I have added don't have the correct nutrition information after I have submitted them even though I added it correctly.) Overall, this is a great app and I use it every day.

Title: This app helped me drop 60 pounds of fat
----------------------------------------------------------
To give backstory, I was an offensive lineman in high school. I was D2 quality coming out of my junior year. My senior year was filled with injuries and eventually I needed shoulder surgery. This surgery and the subsequent recovery process lead me to peruse academics as my means of scholarship. After I had decided this, I was left with about 3 more months of physical therapy. After my physical therapy was done, I was left an atrophied mess. The muscles I once used to push and block were now faded and flabby. I was fat. During my years of football, I had always wanted to be a leaner, more athletic version of myself. I now had the ability to do so, no longer needing the weight for football purposes.

Title: Cannot believe it's a lite edition app?! Free?! What?!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have made a pledge to lose 50 lbs in 50 days and so far I have lost 16 lbs in 16 days with diet & exercise, and of course this great app!!  There is a remarkable amount of foods pre-programmed into the app, I have only had to manually add 2 individual foods, which is so nice because it's very quick & efficient to use the search & everything pops right up. It's not just a calorie counter either, the food list shows fat, protein & carbs nutrition facts per serving as well!  It also allows you to track the water you drink (super important!) and log your weight (which it displays as a chart) so cool!!!  If you want to join me in losing weight this is a great app to help along the way. #50lbsin50days

Title: Amazing App
----------------------------------------------------------
So I‚Äôve been around the calorie counting circuit for a while. I‚Äôve used MyFitnessPal and hated it right off the bat (ads and struggling to find certain foods). I‚Äôve also tried SparksPeople which at first was great and I lost 40 lbs with it. However now, it‚Äôs become ad city and for whatever reason, when I use the app, I severely reduce my calorie intake because I would have my macros ate at 1300 calories and that was maddening to see. With MyPlate, I don‚Äôt have those worries of MyFitnessPal or SparksPeople. The ads are exceedingly manageable compared to the other services and it gives you healthy recipes to try out based on the amount of calories you have left for the day. 10/10 I do recommend!

Title: 5 stars but I'm holding back 1
----------------------------------------------------------
This is truly an astonishing app. This is a must have if you want to gain lose or stay the same weight. You will change your routine for the better. They have such a large library of foods you just have to type in if you don't have a bar code (which works ever time in seconds) or you can manually put it in. It's nice knowing what your putting in your body and seeing how your routine affects your health. Again You will change your routine for the better. Only reason I hold one star is bc I see a bright future for this app and I hope the creators will push the limits with its future. But bc I don't want them to have 4 stars I'll post 5. Keep doing your amazing work guys you've set the standards.

Title: Great, but with a Bad Change
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using this app for a long time, and generally, it‚Äôs awesome. The UI is really nice, and it makes it easy to track things quickly and keep tabs on nutrition. One key change, however, has disappointed me. In a recent update, they changed the weight progress chart from a scatter plot to bar graph. Not a big deal, right? Unfortunately, this UI change has made it look like my weight has hardly changed at all over time, while previously it showed weight changes as dramatic, which I found encouraging. This new change is frustrating and makes it harder to be excited about my progress. I‚Äôm not sure if this review will reach any devs, but I‚Äôd like to hear their thought process on this change.

Thanks for your review and feedback. We‚Äôve just released an update to the app addressing these concerns. Please update to version 5.31.0. If you still have questions or concerns, please send us an email at¬†support@livestrong.com.

Title: Easy And Successful!
----------------------------------------------------------
Joining MyPlate is one of the smartest things I've ever done! By using their easy to use App I have successfully lost 55 pounds. Now, this didn't happen magically and it didn't happen without my being faithful to using MyPlate but it was indeed a pleasurable way to drop a good amount of unwanted, ugly pounds! I have been dedicated to MyPlate for about 8 months and it truly is a joy to use! I actually look forward to entering what goes into my mouth and it encourages me to choose my foods wisely. Prior to using MyPlate my carb intake was atrocious and I ate hardly any protein! Now, I'm better! MyPlate makes it easy for me to track my intake of protein, carbs, sodium and my favorite...WATER!!!

Title: Wow
----------------------------------------------------------
I have nothing but great things to say about this app. I started working out January 1st and I lost about 2-3 pounds. I was new to this lifestyle and didn‚Äôt know how to diet, so I found this app and downloaded it. When I started using it in February, I was immediately made aware of all the empty calories I didn‚Äôt even know I was consuming. It has helped me so much and made me more aware of how to live a healthy lifestyle. I started using this app February 7th weighing 152, with exercise and the help of this app, it‚Äôs now March 26th and I weigh 134. I really love this app and it‚Äôs so simple to use, and I highly recommend this app to anyone looking for guidance in a lifestyle change.

Title: So glad I tried this app!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've attempted to use similar apps in the past to track food intake and exercise progress while tracking weight loss, but they weren't very easy to navigate and offered no motivation - so I never had much success with them.   To my great DM surprise, the LiveStrong app is exactly what I was looking for!  It's customizable without too many steps to go through, and - best of all - it works!!  I've been using the app faithfully for about 6 weeks and I've lost 11 lbs and already feel much healthier!   Since I've had so much success using the free version I'm ready now to take advantage of the very reasonably-priced full version to reach my overall goals.  I highly recommend this app!

Title: Great program
----------------------------------------------------------
This weight loss program is working for me.  So far I have lost eight pounds.  I used another app and did not lose much weight and did not stick with it.  I think this one is working because it give me a more realistic calorie count for my age and activity level.  By the way, I am a senior citizen and can now wear a size 8-10.  Give it a try.  The key to success is to enter every bite you take and plan ahead if you are going to eat out.  Look up the calorie count BEFORE you eat it--not after like I have done a few times.  I never again will scarf down a 7-11 brownie then look up the calories when I get home.  Those suckers have 600 calories in them!  Good luck you can do it!

----------------------------------------------------------
Today I woke up feeling worst than ever before... I'm 100 lbs overweight, I don't sleep well, I don't exercise and worst of all I eat all everything that I crave.  Most of which are very unhealthy, processed, sugary and high in fat!  I've gained a lot of weight with this lifestyle and It all ends today!! Thanks to this wonderful app, I got half the work cut out for me. All I got to do now is MAKE BETTER DECISIONS, eat more plant based food, some protein and lots and LOTS OF WATER AND EXERCISE! I'm not ready for any of this but today is the  the day. i will take my first step and I will continue this journey until I reach my goal! Thanks for this app I really appreciate it :)

Title: App is great!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using it for a little more than a week now (free version) & I'm really finding it helpful. Even though I've been tracking some of this on paper for years, this seems to work better somehow?! I like the exercise component & being able to log my exercise & have it "count". Ditto for water intake. I've set my calorie goal about 100 calories less than what I was doing before starting the app & so far I've kept close to it...even my daily average was slightly less for the week üòÄ! I do allow myself treats  & I'll probably take a day off once in awhile but this app is helping me stay on track & I don't feel "deprived". Kudos to the MyPlate team & keep up the good work! üòâ

Title: So many improvements since I tried it last
----------------------------------------------------------
I am vision impaired and I have been using this app for over a year. I have used both the free version and the upgrade, and both are excellent. In addition, I have contacted the developers about features in the app that were not accessible. They have written me very courteous responses and have fixed most of the issues willingly. I appreciate their efforts for inclusion. I would like to suggest that in the fractional pop-up menu for less than whole quantities of a serving that I add smaller quantities then 1/4 serving. I would like to be able to log smaller amounts such as 1-3 ounces, teaspoons, or tablespoons. I would strongly recommend both versions of this app.

----------------------------------------------------------
First and foremost this app is free so I am still amazed at the quality of this app. For awhile I even thought maybe it was a trial version and after certain amount of time I would be prompted to buy full version. I just knew it had to be a catch. Not only is it still free but at this point if they charged me I would buy it because I'm hooked. I only been using it for one week and lost 5.7 lbs in one week. I recommend it to any and everyone. It's so perfect that its right on your phone so easy to track and keeps you conscious of everything you eat an portion sizes. And any food and exercise you can think of was in database. I'm telling everyone about this!!!!

Title: Best app ever.
----------------------------------------------------------
I LOVE this app. Because you calculate exactly what you eat. It's perfect for weight loss, weight maintenance, etc.  What I'd like it to have is a bit of recommendations on what to eat during the day, and add exercises so I can actually know how many calories I burned, because the step tracker is great but if I do any other exercise I'd like to know how much I burned.  Also, it would be better if it had an area where you could type if you feel bloated, or post pictures of yourself to keep track (with privacy options of course), and maybe tips on how to avoid bloat, or find fiber-rich foods, etc. But it's still a great app. I couldn't live without it!

----------------------------------------------------------
I honestly love this app, it's easy to use, I'm not sure if it helps you really lose weight with the goals because I'm already active but I was eating anything and everything and not seeing much improvement. If you enter everything you eat honestly it makes you accountable for the choices you make which, hopefully, leads to better ones! It also lets you keep track of exercise which is also motivation to get to enter your workouts in! All in all I love it and it does just what it says, helps you track your calories :) just remember that calories are not all equal so 150 cal of salad and 150 cal or chips are not the same so go healthy when you can!

User friendly easy to use app makes me visualize exactly what is on my plate. Keeps my goal in front of me at all times. I am motivated by the extra portions I can have when I enter my exercises. Love that i determine if I want to workout and get a food reward, get even closer to my goal, or be lazy and forego my extra snack. All without getting off track of my goal. I like tracking my water too which shows me how i get hungrier when my water intake is low. Great app has everything I need to track my fitness and nutrition-- calorie intake, exercise calories burned, bmi/weight, searchable nutrition information, water intake, and tracking my goals.

Title: Best tracking app
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôd been using Lose it for a year but I felt like I was stagnating with it. So I decided to try this one out, and it‚Äôs so much better. I love how it breaks everything down for you in terms of how much sodium and whatnot you‚Äôre eating, not just calories. And it allows you to track water intake as well without charging you to do so, Lose It requires you to go premium to do that. This app also connects rather seamlessly to the health app that comes on your iPhone, and gives you an idea of how many calories you‚Äôre burning instead of just saying ‚Äútake this many steps and get a calorie bonus‚Äù like Lose It does. I find this feature much more useful.

Title: Better than Weight Watchers
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has been such a God send! I have done Weights Watchers (WW) twice in the last five years with fantastic results but the reality is, it's expensive and not conducive to reality. Counting calories is so much easier than counting "points" and you feel free to eat what you want, when you want. This app links to you Apple Health which is even better because it also informs you how many calories you burned. I just think it's so great. I can't believe you get as much access as you do for free. There is of course a gold level which costs money but the free offer of this app provides me with all I need and more. Definitely worth the download.

It‚Äôs very nicely organized and gives the info & feedback I need to help me stick with it.  As a pre-diabetic I wish the developer would add the ability to track blood sugar information. If it had that I‚Äôd be able to delete at least 6 other apps that I have to fumble with daily. Thank you for a great intuitive pleasant to use app, and please consider adding other features, perhaps as an alternative app, or with subscription options.

I always love this app it shows me a real breakdown of foods, calories and fats.  It helps me understand my target daily goal in order to accomplish my big goal.  I used to track all calories in a book and now (large again). This is way easier and I like that I don‚Äôt have to go to several websites to get a breakdown of my BMI and needed calories to reach my goal.  I‚Äôm a little suspicious of my sweet tea being too forgiving on this site but it‚Äôs all good.  I hope in future it has more breakdowns of popular recipes for diets using restrictions.  I have to cook all foods to be corn, wheat and dairy free which generally lines up with paleo.

Title: Love it but.....
----------------------------------------------------------
I have absolutely loved this app. After years of not being able to lose any weight, I stumbled on this app. My life has been changed, I eat better, walk more and can still have room for sweets when I want. At 59, I now dropped 22 pounds and wear a 34 waist down about 5‚Äù. Here is the problem I have experienced recently.  My walking calories are not registering which I really depend on. I had a problem with my iPhone 6+ when the tracking quit working.  I got a replacement from Apple but was surprised to see that the walking calories still are not sinking up even though I have enabled it in the settings. Thank you for this powerful app!

I wish I can give this app 10 stars!!! It also really puts into perspective how much you are truly consuming in a day! I would recommend this app to anyone that is trying to lose weight or even maintain weight for that matter! This app is so versatile! So grateful that was recommended to me by a friend!!

I love this app. So easy to use, tracks my exercise on my Apple Watch and my weight on Fit Index. I take medicine that makes me gain weight in the past it made me very cautious of what I ate. Which mean I ate far less than I should have been eating. This app helped me live a healthier lifestyle and worry less about gaining weight I know how many calories and carbs I‚Äôve had and how many calories I still need to reach my daily goal. My family thought I was nuts tracking every meal but now that I lost weight and am not starving myself they are joining me on the app! Thank you so much for creating this and making it free.

----------------------------------------------------------
I am sure I don't use the app for all that it can do but I do use it for logging my food/calorie intake and water intake. It is quick and easy. Most of the foods are already loaded in and a couple keystrokes will bring it up or something really close. I also love the barcode scanner. One zap and my food choice is logged and calculated. I just wish I could have everything in one app and maybe I do and just don't know it but I use my Apple Watch for fitness tracking, run for weight loss app for a virtual fitness coach, and this for food and hydration. It works but would work better if it was one stop shop!  LUV THIS APP NO LESS!

This app is so very helpful to me and is also keeping me very motivated to actually track my meals.....which is usually not what anyone really likes to do.

The reminders are also very helpful because I get busy with my day and sometimes forget to enter my info and then a reminder pops up which is awesome. I am currently on a Keto-type meal plan and would like to see more Keto foods listed. Thanks for a great app and I look forward to seeing it improve and expand even more as the food search portion grows. A very user-friendly app and easy to use.

Don't get the points part yet, but seems like I am winning and that's fun.  Kudos to you for having a great food list too, you have so much of what I eat and so that is great because it is not punishing or work to log it and keeps me out of doing this 'food math' in my head.

I'm a teenager and a little self conscious on my weight.... I run distance, but I find my self eating...  A LOT..... I was kinda worried, since I was the youngest and was prone to getting picked on... I am a healthy weight.... But I knew that during the summer I don't run and with me eating all the time I gain weight... So I decided to get a diet app.... I looked it up and my plate popped up, so I got it.... Best App Ever!!!üòèüòéüëÄ thank you so much Myplate it makes it easier to lose weight and stay fit and keep it up... I had tried a few other apps like this and I slowly stopped using them... But no Myplate thanks!!!üòèüòéüëÄüòÑüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª

Title: Loving the workouts!
----------------------------------------------------------
The short workouts are great -- hard, but really good cause they are fast and easy to do just about anywhere. And the new Gold workouts are great for targeting a specific part of the body. I love how it automatically tracks the calories burned. Also love that I can set up my same breakfast to automatically track every morning. As well as the lunch I eat most weekdays. This app continues to makes it easy for me to manage my weight. It makes me honest with myself about what I'm eating. Super cool to see all my progress over the year with the charts. And the others using the app help keep me motivated and answer my questions.

Title: Much Needed Change
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm T2 Diabetic, and lost 120lbs five years ago to help reduce the complications and severity. I‚Äôve been using both Lose It and My Fitness Pal religiously (MFP, and then Lose It for the last three years) with success, but after downloading my plate just to try it out via a recommendation of a friend, I‚Äôve completely switched. The app interface is much more user friendly, portions are more accurate and I have found the goals and nutrient options to be the best yet. Also, the app provides amazing meal ideas based on current calories available which really cuts down on my day when I‚Äôm too exhausted to get creative with food.

Title: Superb app
----------------------------------------------------------
This app was very helpful preferably with being able to recognize and keep track what I was consuming as well as my daily intake of calories, fats, carbs, and protein. Additionally, this app provided a weight tracker and was able to graph it on a chart which was quite intriguing to see my weight loss drop from a graphical perspective as days/weeks went by. Unfortunately I have no further use of this app for I'm now able to use my daily routine of meals with slight variety of foods. However this app got me started on my weight loss plan and helped me succeed as well as provide me what I needed at the time. A food tracker.

Title: Easy to use
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like My Plate. It is easy to use and pretty fast. It doesn't have quite as many foods as other apps, but it feels less obtrusive to me. I tried other apps and felt like I was being hounded constantly through notifications and email. I get a very helpful email from this app that was my choice to get and I actually read it. I also appreciate that it communicates with my iHealth app on excercise and steps. The one thing I find missing, and it's a biggy, is that I can't put a recipe in and have it count and divide servings. I have to go to an external website to do it. I hope they are working on that for the future.

Title: This app turned my life around
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded this app once I was diagnosed with diabetes.  My supportive family downloaded the app as well.  We use the app to keep track of our meals and calories.  We get meal ideas and other tips. It uses the data from our Apple watches to show calories burned from our workouts.  This app empowered and educated me and my family.  It keeps me from quitting.  I have only lost 12 pounds so far, but I have gained tons of confidence and knowledge. I have gained support from my family, and I have gained the support needed to be healthier from this app. Once you download this app it can help uplift you into a healthier you.

Title: What a Great App!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is what I have been looking for for along time. It is so easy to use!! I have lost 120 pounds and always wonder how many calories I was eating. I tried to count them but I didn't right them down and I would forget how many I had. Now I have found this app, I don't have to write them down or remember how much I was eating, it tells me brands I am eating and get the right calories. It tells me how many calories I am burning off and how much water I am drinking. I will get to my goal weight faster because I will know how many calories I am consuming. It has so much more to the app! This is a must app to have!!!

Title: Helpful, thorough app
----------------------------------------------------------
In combination with a personal health plan, this app helps me to hold myself accountable EASILY through tracking my exercise and food intake.  It's helpful to immediately see that what I just consumed contained more carbs than protein, or vice versa though a color coordinated graph. It's helping me rethink my meals to get more balance throughout the day instead of packing on the carbs in the evening. I chart my meals and water throughout the day and I find myself being more productive because I am exercising, focused on a goal and have a plan which I am following with the support of the app. Very happy with this find

Title: Been using for 4 years
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used this app during all of my fitness / health kicks over the past four years and I‚Äôve tried others like it and I can safely and assuredly claim that no other free nutrition tracking app is as good as this one. It helps you stay motivated, the recipes and caloric targets are fun and helpful, and the overall interface is so user friendly. Most foods I have ever wanted have already been put into the system, save for one specific type of brownie, so it‚Äôs easy to just jump into because of that, too. LOVE THIS APP!!!!!! I recommend it to all of my friends that are concerned with their diet or general health.

Title: Great app! No txfr issues
----------------------------------------------------------
I've used the website/app for many years and love it.  I have an iPhone 6 and ipad2 and had no issues switching to the new version.  All data (at least 5 yrs worth) transferred.  To those saying the food is all in different measurements... Yes, because it's user entered.  Enter your own if there isn't an entry in a measurement you need... Or use the barcode scanner.  This app only works as well as the person faithfully documenting what you eat/drink and excercise.  If you track appropriately it makes the lifestyle change easier because you hold yourself accountable.  You see what snacking looks like in numbers.

Title: Great, effective food journal and workouts
----------------------------------------------------------
I had been using a popular app for food tracking and found the food items to be inaccurate a lot of the times. This solved that problem, for the most part. There are still some foods other people have entered into the food lists that have incorrect nutrition information, but fewer of them. I wish the food plans they provide would take into account what macro percentages you want‚Äîthe options are limited. That‚Äôs my biggest gripe since I had wanted to use it to help plan my weight loss. The workouts the app provides are fun and effective. I really like them. Overall, a seriously well-designed and functioning app.

Title: MyPlate changed my health and fitness game
----------------------------------------------------------
I give a 10 star rating to this wonderful app. I know that I was certainly committed to change in terms of my health and fitness habits as well as to loose weight and get back to my healthy weight. However I don‚Äôt think I could have done it without the help of this life changing app. I have been tracking my portions and food choices, as well as my exercise and water intake since January 2019 on this app, and I am thrilled to have already lost 20+ lbs and have just 2 to go to reach my healthy weight goal!! I thank you MyPlate and recommend it to everyone that is looking to make a change for good in your health!

Title: Very useful tool to keep track of ones food intake
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using this app a month ago. I logged all the food I ate , snacked and drank . When I Frist started logging my foods ,the design it had to show you the carbs fats and protein you intake enabled me to realize i was eating way too much carbs and fats and not enough protein . I since then am on a reduced low carb diet , consisting of eating 60 grams of carbs a meal 3 times a day .i I thought it would be easy, but I has I went on I figured that out that a lot of the food I eat and I'm general  has a lot of carbs in them. But since I've done this I was able to lose 6 pounds. Recommend this app to anybody

Title: Love it and addicted
----------------------------------------------------------
Even at a young age I'm still growing. But I wanted to start healthy! So with this app I have lost a lot of unwanted fat and I have noticed what I have been eating. How many calories that thing has or even the carbs worried me the most! But with this app you can lose weight and stay healthy! I also love this app because it tracks my exercise! I have a Fitbit, but I like to keep track on here just for the heck of it! But it tells how many calories I can still consume after I have already ate something! It tells me how many calories I also burnt so that definitely helps a lot of people! -/CocoaBeanCOrps\~*

Title: Helpful, Intuitive and Effective!
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded this app before my first ever ‚Äúreal‚Äù cut - I lost 25 healthy pounds in 3 months. I‚Äôm now on a bulk and am steadily increasing my weight with the app‚Äôs recommendations and meals. The notifications are motivational and helpful in reminding me to track when I eat, the exercise connects with my Apple Watch and gives accurate readings, and I‚Äôm overall pleased with the results in my health and body that I‚Äôve seen. I have been (and will continue to) recommend this app wholeheartedly to my friends and family. Totally worth the download - that is if you have the motivation to start your own journey.
