Title: Bitterly disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
I am so bitterly disappointed. It was a wonderful app. I used this app years ago when first diagnosed with diabetes.  My doctor recommended it. I used it faithfully and it worked to make me strong and healthy. I loved, loved, loved it.  It had so many wonderful features and functions. But I strayed from the path of healthiness and stopped using it. I should not have done it, because it really worked. But alas, I did.  Now, sitting in my home today, I decided to open up my faithful fitness friend because staying at home during this pandemic is causing me not to eat properly, snacking and such and have gained weight, throwing my diabetes out of whack. So I thought hey, let‚Äôs get back on the wonderful my fitness pal app! I was so excited. I opened it up. It still had all of my history. It still had all the features I loved and then some. I was so excited. Then.... I realized... that all those extra amazing features I loved to use for free back then, are now only available for use for a FEE WITH A PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION!  I don‚Äôt know how much it is because you can‚Äôt tell unless you actually sign up for it.  So it must be pricey if they hide the price from you. It left a bitter taste in my mouth that the company has done this.  The only good thing is that I did stop using it.  Can you imagine using the app for years then one day, you log in and are told... sorry you can‚Äôt use us anymore without paying for it.  You can only imagine what some poor schmuck‚Äôs reaction was to that???  I loved the app once and was hoping to love it once again.  But this news has left a bitter taste in my mouth. Like I said... I am frustrated and bitterly disappointed ...  I shall go count my pathetic sugar levels elsewhere....

Title: A piece of garbage I only use because there‚Äôs nothing else
----------------------------------------------------------
As a fitness trainer and health coach, this is unfortunately the best tracker on the market, but that‚Äôs not saying much. I really need it for my clients, but its function is enough to make you wanna smash your phone. It‚Äôs super slow, buggy, freezes and crashes, randomly won‚Äôt find foods that are totally there in the database even when you have every keyword right (instead showing you completely unrelated things) ‚Äî search function is basically broken.  Doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúsave as‚Äù feature for recipes which should be so easy so if you want to make a version with one thing different you have to start all over. frequently pages are blank when you scroll back to the day before or the day after; you have to click the edit button twice to make it actually stick where you can edit, and their most recent interface update is a total nightmare ‚Äì they made everything one color and one size so you can‚Äôt tell one thing from the next and the numerals in the top bar are smaller and harder to see. The meals used to be separated by a blue bar and now they‚Äôre white and indistinguishable from the entries. Unbelievably classic case of making changes just to make changes ‚Äì for the worse. When I asked if I could have the older version back so it was more readable, they refused. I am a premium user paying 60 bucks a year for this garbage.   I need an app like this and it‚Äôs the only game in town, but it could be so much better. If something better comes along, I will switch in a heartbeat.

Title: Recent and Frequent food items not displaying properly
----------------------------------------------------------
Why are my "Recent" and "Frequent" food tabs not showing recent or frequent foods in this app? I can go online to the website and it works fine. This is very unhelpful, I need the app to work properly! Even searching for the items with their specific names within the app does not work. I have to go back to the last time I ate it and copy the whole meal to my current meal, then delete what's not relevant to my current meal! It's very strange, and I have tried adjusting all the settings I can to make it work properly. I still do not like the change made to input weight - it's not as simple and intuitive as the past one, and the advertisement for an Under Armor scale is larger than anything else on the page. The text is quite small, which only helps to show the scale advertisement more. As if there weren't enough invasive advertisements already since Under Armor bought the app! Just keeps getting worse! I understand the need for ads - revenue generation. There are many other ways this could be achieved, like offering things in between the extremes of buying for only one month or for a whole year of premium features! Or paying for certain features instead of all the features, or just getting rid of all the ads and the ads masquerading as "stories" or "healthy recipes"! It's an offer made by most every other app that is free and powered by ads, and it works well.

Title: Amazing Potential
----------------------------------------------------------
Would give 6 stars but this app is just not sexy or useful without digging deep. The front page is bland and totally unappealing. It should be a modern dashboard with vitals not a information feed. I am not a baby and want my dashboard not congratulations messages taking up real estate. The food database is A+ and live the way you can scan food in. Graph choices are.....one. % of fat to carbs to protein. Who cares? I want options of % carbs to max allowable for example. Or % of calcium to max allowable. Someone made the wrong call that we only want to measure fat, carbs and protein against themselves. Really? Again I am not a baby and want to USE the amazing data that this program has to offer in ways THAT I CHOOSE. It's the best out there but just not good looking at all or configurable. It's sad. Someone needs to redesign this app. We are adults not 10 year olds. The social media and coaching focus in the daily feed is annoying to some like me. I want an app like this only one that lets ME focus on how I am going to lose weight, not one that assumes there is only one way. For example I am loosing a pound a day using low carb approach. Not much room for that in this app. There needs to be space for me to adjust my own approach and for me to turn off all the noise of the feed. The interface needs to catch up with the database.

Title: Glitchy and non responsive
----------------------------------------------------------
I am not usual one to write reviews however the issues I found with this app was beyond what one should expect and I have just downloaded and can‚Äôt use it. Therefore, I felt compelled to write in hopes that someone will read and fix these issues. As mentioned, I had just downloaded the app and wanting to check it out before paying for the premium service. First, it denied me signing up 3x before I was final accepted my information to open up the app. Then as I went to put in my exercise for the day it gave no options for cardio and strength based workouts ( ie: HIIT, interval, circuit etc) and when I clicked on the ‚Äúroutines‚Äù option it just keep spinning the load circle bringing nothing up. Adding single food items was fine but when input ingredients to ‚Äúcreate a recipe‚Äù it gave me an error pop up and told me to retry. Meaning I would ya e to input all the Ingredients I had just done again. I did this 3x again to no avail. Then lastly it asked for me to verify my email account that was connect via an email sent. I had done so hours before but was asked to do it again. So I requested another verification be sent. Over an hour later still have not received the email. This app is extremely disappointing and there are many others out there and I have deleted this app and will find one that actually works.

Title: CALORIE COUNTING IS UNHEALTHY!
----------------------------------------------------------
calorie counting can damage how you see food and can lead to an eating disorder! i used to use this app all the time, and i can assure everyone reading this that it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre eating ‚Äútoo much‚Äù - it matters WHAT you‚Äôre eating. 1000 calories worth of healthy food is NOT the same as 1000 calories as junk food but you would never know that using this app. You could be eating 1000 calories of junk food and still feel like you‚Äôre eating right because you‚Äôre eating the calories ‚Äúyou‚Äôre allowed to eat‚Äù This app makes you feel guilty for eating even if you‚Äôre eating healthy. there‚Äôs no reason you should be hungry and have to check your phone to see if you‚Äôre allowed to eat. There‚Äôs no reason you should go to bed hungry because this app tells you to. Do not download this app - you should not be obsessed with everything revolving around food and weight. it can lead to so many problems especially if you‚Äôre insecure or just more prone to it. i‚Äôve been obsessed with how i eat because of how much i used to revolve my life around this app and sometimes i still catch myself counting calories! if you really want to lose weight, stay active and eat healthy(but it is also always okay to indulge in yourself sometimes)

Title: Premium subscription is a scam
----------------------------------------------------------
I absolutely love this app and have used it for years without issue to track macronutrients and plan food intake. Recently my training routine changed where I would need to have different caloric intakes on different days of the week. So I decided to purchase a one-month subscription to the premium service to see if it added convenience. This is where I lost all respect for MyFitnessPal. Now that I have ‚Äúpremium‚Äù, the app refuses to sync to the website. It will say ‚Äúfailed to sync data saved locally‚Äù each and every time. When copying over meals from the previous day, it will copy the meal 8-12 times. When I then go to delete these extra entries, the website crashes and shows an error screen. What used to be a great app/website has overnight turned into a nightmare. I have since created an alternate free account that syncs without issue and copies over meals as before, except now I have to rebuild my food library from scratch. So therefore the only issue is the paid subscription. This is crap, MyFitnessPal! Does any of this sound like a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù experience to you? I‚Äôll just go back to manually changing my calorie goal every day as before. Thanks for the headache and the wasted $10.

Title: Inaccurate food entries
----------------------------------------------------------
For the same food items! Users are allowed to enter nutritional data lacking verification of accuracy. Users may report the inaccurate food data, and add corrections, but the inaccurate entries remain. As you repeatedly use the same accurate entry it becomes the first option in your Frequent Foods. Unfortunately MFP doesn‚Äôt seem to eliminate inaccurate data after correction reports from users. After correcting a Fast Food restaurant sandwich entry recently I still see the same inaccuracies. As a diabetic who counts carbohydrates there is a big difference between true carbohydrates at 57.8 grams with 551 calories and 62 grams with 700 calories! Both are inaccurate and my correct report is 66 grams of carbohydrates with 630 calories. I attempted to share this via ‚ÄúContact‚Äù hoping someone would recognize the inherent frustration created along with obvious health risks if users fail validate the information presented and presume all entries are valid. Most Commercial restaurants have nutritional info on their websites so PLEASE insure accuracy before using any entry for user safety. I‚Äôm a Premium subscriber who has been using MFP for a few years.

Title: Security breach!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This company has had security breaches but I found out from other sources. They force me to accept giving them location and I get a pop up from Apple letting me know they're stalking me. I have "never" set up in my settings so listen to Apple. They'll let you know that this app is following you everywhere so they can send ads. It's important you not give this company any personal information because they were BREACHED and I had to find this out FROM MY BANK!! Since the breach, I'm getting hundreds of porn emails and spam. BEWARE! YOU'RE BEING FOLLOWED and if you have had an account with them for awhile, your email and all your weight, foods and other personal info are on the dark net. Your weight is on the dark net and you'll get porn related to your weight. It's seriously disgusting what they've allowed to happen and all they needed too do is tell us they'd been hacked. Why wouldn't the developers tell people this yet and more importantly, WHY was our information left unsecured?? When people at a company take our personal info, we should have a reasonable expectation of security. Not these developers but will they tell you??? Nope!!

Title: Doesn't do ANYTHING!
----------------------------------------------------------
I don't get what people see is so great about this app. I just started and so far not only have I had to enter all the information by hand for the most basic of foods (like oatmeal, which is pretty standard) but it doesn't allow for having less than a serving. So if I have 2/3 of a serving I have to enter that I had one. It's a computer program and it can't even do this math. For some reason it also cares about how many serving sizes are "in a container", so if you have any healthy food that doesn't come in containers it's completely useless. Literally all it does is add calories while you sit there doing all the actual work of adding up nutritional value for foods you aren't even eating a full serving of, and they want $5-10/mo for this? Total scam. I'm not against folks making an easy buck but it won't be *my* bucks they're making! I know how to add just fine. It doesn't even make suggestions, ffs. Literally all it does is add simple numbers. All I can say is there are a LOT of people falling for this trendy little calculator that can't even figure as much as the calculator that comes on their phone!

Title: Drop the BS and get back to what your serious users want...
----------------------------------------------------------
I've used myfitnesspal for years and turned many folks on to it as well. It WAS a great, functional, simple and fast app to use. Now it's become too "fat" and dysfunctional to those users who need a serious app for tracking their meals. Why bury the basic functionality of the app within the application and have friend's feeds and such on the home page?? Keep it the great simple meal recorder that was and move all of the social media back into the depths of menus as you have the basic food recording items. Give us the option to turn off all but the basic recording features that we originally signed up for. You are missing the boat with these past couple of ridiculous updates and you are going to losing many of  your serious core users . I have always used MFP with FitBit but now with your latest release, I can probably drop MFP. Why are you putting social media ahead of your original functionality that everyone loved and signed up for? Your faithful users would probably pay for a version of your app if it had the SM and Adds removed... Separate yourself from all of the other Facebook wannabes.

Title: Can't even create a proper account
----------------------------------------------------------
I've never used this app, and so badly want to because of all of the great reviews it's received in the past. However, I'm trying to create a new account and enter all the relevant information (e.g. Current weight, height, etc.) but when I get to the 5th section of the sign-up process, I keep getting the error "invalid goal weight; please enter your goal weight." I've entered both my current weight and my goal weight and the app won't let me continue in the signup process. I think it's actually skipping the 4th section because it goes directly from activity level to current height and current weight. This glitch is really frustrating and off-putting. If I can't even set up the basic functions for using this app then why would I let it remain on my iPhone? It's taking up space that I could use for another fitness tracking app. Deleting it as soon as I'm done writing this review. Hopefully the developers sort these glitches out or else they'll be losing a bunch of loyal followers, since it seems that I'm not the only one who is disappointed with the newfound glitches.

Title: All About The Money
----------------------------------------------------------
The newest change has got me looking elsewhere. I have used MyFitnessPal for over 6 years (have a streak of logging for 2373 days) I have seen lots of changes to the app over the years, but most recent all the push to ‚Äúpremium‚Äù and all the ads. I don‚Äôt mind having to scroll through ads knowing its free but when you start eliminating things that were in the free version that bugs me. Starting November 1, they will only store information for 2 years unless you are a premium member. I really enjoyed being able to look back at my progress and see trends (good and bad) with my health/fitness goals. Now if I want to keep that I have to pay for it. This was a no-nonsense easy way to track food/exercise that I would rave about to others. Not anymore as they have jumped in on the ‚Äúprofit first‚Äù instead of working towards general well-being for others. So bummed to see such a simple to use app change so much and become so commercialized. Keep looking if you are looking for a basic food/activity tracker for free. This one will hook you then make you pay...not worth it anymore.

Title: The UX is awful
----------------------------------------------------------
Adding meals is such a mystery, you can tell that they try to reuse screens as much  as possible, making the performance of adding a meal and adding a food confusing because they look exactly the same. But that‚Äôs not the worst part - the part that made me stop what I was doing to come directly to the App Store and leave a pissy review. The fact that I have to manually save my progress when creating a meal, like its 1995, is so stupid and counter intuitive to modern apps that it must have been a conscious decision. How ludicrous! I have lost 10 minutes of work logging meals 3 times since purchasing my membership two days ago. The identical screens make it so easy to push the back button one too many times and complete lose all of the foods I‚Äôve logged in a meal. It doesn‚Äôt try to prevent you from doing it either - so bad! Here‚Äôs what should happen, every change I make should automatically be saved. If I want to change something later I can do so easily. I can‚Äôt, however, recall 10 minutes worth of food logging with the same amount of ease.

Title: Latest Update Horrible
----------------------------------------------------------
The latest update removed several features that I've come to rely on in the 2.5 years that I've been using this app, not the least of which is the horror that is the weekly nutrition overview, but today I logged on and saw that my streak was at two days instead of the nearly 500 that it should have been, even though I have not missed a SINGLE day and logged all of my food for the week on Sunday night. While this might not be a big deal to most people it was a huge motivator to me and to say that I am angry is an understatement. I think the powers that be at MfP must not have ever heard the phrase "if it ain't broke, don't fix it", because every update for the last six months has been worse than the one before. I've lost over 100 pounds in the last two years while using this app but MfP's glitches and lack of functionality have now lost ME, a drop in the bucket in their user base, I'm sure, but the drops will start adding up the same way pounds do if they continue their current practices. Adios, MfP, I'll miss what you used to be.

Title: Buggy 2
----------------------------------------------------------
This a use to work very well, but this version is almost not worth using.  The first thing it did was calculate yesterday's exercise into today's totals.  Yesterday I walked the dog for 30 min. And swam for 45 min. Today it adding the swimming I did yesterday for a cardio workout.  Today I went to the gym and did 3 different exercises for both chest and back.  It did not calculate the totals into my exercise and only gave me calorie burned for walking, even though it says I did swimming as well.  It also would not register the number of reps. I did one one exercise,  and when I tried to edit,  it changed the reps on another exercise. It still registers as not having done any reps on that one exercise.  I've updated, gotten out of the program and logged out, but nothing changes.  It also won't let me delete any history for posts, and I have posts from 2 years ago sitting on my iPad.  I turned off all posts. Thanks for updating the program, not!  I'm giving this 1 star but since it won't post my response because "there are not

Title: Premium Subscription
----------------------------------------------------------
I understand two things with the nature of free trials and subscriptions. If you forget about them they over charge and do it without notification. This is the first app review I‚Äôve ever done, not only because I was charged for a YEAR subscription after one month of trial (They could have just charged me 9.99 for another month instead of taking the last bit of money I‚Äôd had available for kids shoes). Listen, I understand that I should have set a reminder and cancelled my subscription like an adult, but sometimes things get busy and we forget. Thus, me trying to contact a human via phone or email (not picky here...just a human). I tried thrice to email and was refused the privilege of sending it because the app rerouted me to learning how to cancel my account. Trust me...I already did that. I just wanted to see if I could contact a human to explain the frustration, and yet I‚Äôm now reduced to having to send a negative review in a public forum - and kind of hate myself for it, but if you can‚Äôt even let me email you...? üòè

Title: Forcing people to Premium at outrageous cost
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to love love love this app. I've lost a lot of weight when I was consistent. I came back after some time and found that the premium level has been added and that there is INESCAPABLE CONSTANT advertising content. It would be one thing if the adds came and went but they actually eat up critical real estate on screen all the time. So I figured OK I'll pay the $3, $4, $10, whatever just to get out of the ads. But then I found out it's $10 PER month or 50 bucks per year. OUTRAGEOUS COST. That is enough for me to research other apps. If this doesn't change I'll do anything to switch weight loss apps. My Fitness Pal was way in front of everybody else, but I'm sure the competition has had a chance to catch up and now I am strongly motivated to do that. To the developers/owners ‚Äì you reached too far. If you're willing to change your advertising so it's less intrusive, or reduce your cost to a reasonable price, send me an email. Otherwise you should be prepared to lose a huge portion of your user base.

Title: What happened?!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve used MyFitnessPal for 10 years, synced it with my Fitbit and it all worked perfectly. I‚Äôve paid for a premium subscription for several years, too. For the past 8 months it has stopped syncing with Fitbit. I‚Äôve contacted both apps to no avail (and I‚Äôve put tickets in at MyFitnessPal at least 8 times). MyFitnessPal responses tell me to just wait and it will sync in the evening. It doesn‚Äôt. I have to force a sync every night to get my data together. MyFitnessPal has also blamed Fitbit for the error, which I don‚Äôt believe. Now, for the last two weeks it‚Äôs been adding food to meals two or three times, and sending way more calories to Fitbit when I force a sync, even if I‚Äôve deleted the additional foods it enters before I sync. I‚Äôm so sick of these ongoing issues that haven‚Äôt been fixed, especially the syncing issue which has been months and months. It‚Äôs so frustrating I‚Äôve cancelled my auto renew, and will be looking for another app to replace it. So disappointing.

Title: Wrong!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am growing increasingly frustrated by the fact that this application changes my target weight loss goals PERMANENTLY if I  tweak my current weight, my goals, or my weekly weight loss goals even slightly just to look at hypotheticals. And when I change the settings back to where I started, the app doesn‚Äôt change the weight loss targets back to what it was before I started tweaking. This randomness makes me incredibly frustrated and makes me want to not use this app anymore. I thought it was just coincidental the first time it happened, but now I realize I can‚Äôt do any hypothetical changes without it becoming permanent. Just today I tried a hypothetical and my daily calorie goal changed from 1690 to 1210 and I can‚Äôt change it back no matter what I enter. This is ridiculous. The makers of this app don‚Äôt realize how much that daily target goal changes my life, and messing with it like this is incredibly demoralizing, illogical, and quite frankly dangerous.

Title: Screwed again
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app of and on for years. I am very careful about when I accept updates because as soon as an app become successful the update often includes unreasonable and intrusive ads. So I carefully read the description of the update this time and it said nothing about inundating you with ads, ads that actually get in the way while you're trying to add foods that you've eaten and so on. Yes, there were some minor improvements, but the trade-off was not worth it.  Let's try little honesty folks and say that we're going to change the app to make you pay for premium to get rid of the ads? And here's an idea, how about marketing to us when we sign in as opposed to interfering with the app's function and utility?  And even better, why not try marketing with something that adds to the experience, like suggesting recipes based on the food we've been eating and linking to sales and local grocery stores? Lesson learned, no more updates.

Title: They will sell your info...
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded this app when it first came out. All the sudden with in a couple of months I started getting so much junk mail from various sporting goods and apps, particularly Under Armor, that I couldn‚Äôt keep up. Every time I unsubscribed, I‚Äôd get two new emails from different companies. Despite unsubscribing from Under Armor no less than TEN time, I kept getting emails from them, sometimes once a day, sometimes five times a day. I wrote to them and asked about not only their own email, but also all the other companies. They denied selling my info and in a less than helpful way, told me to go to me ‚ÄúMy Fitness Pal‚Äù app and manage my emails. I did this and did it help? Nope. I threatened legal action and it finally stopped. THEN a news story about how this company had a data breach that they hide until they couldn‚Äôt hide it any longer. AVOID THIS APP, UNDER ARMOR and anything associated with it, you‚Äôll save yourself a headache trust me.

I had been struggling with OCD and anxiety, and using this app definitely turned my "curiosity" about calories into compulsive counting, checking, worrying, and eventually starving. I developed serious anorexia nervosa over the next year and suffered anxiety attacks, heart problems, bone density loss, and so many other things in my body that I don't even understand. Looking back through the apps, I see this one and it brings back memories. I'm not saying it was the straight up cause of my anorexia. I will even say it is good for someone who needs to lose a serious amount of weight (I lost 30 lbs, finally weighing in at 87 lbs). But I just want to give a warning that this app can lead to obsession, and could even change your life. I'm fully recovered now, and use all my newfound strength to help prevent others from suffering what I did. Thank you :)

Title: Problems hanging up and crashing
----------------------------------------------------------
The last few updates have made the app unreliable. It seems to take forever updating food and exercise entries. At times it becomes totally unresponsive. I have to quit and relaunch frequently. Last night it took me twenty minutes to make three food entries for food items I eat frequently. My iPad mini2 is current in all its iOS updates. I seldom have more than two apps running at a time. I have reinstalled the app more than once but this really doesn‚Äôt help. I find a much older version on my original iPad (1st generation) works more reliably, but this is only available to me at home and can‚Äôt scan bar codes. I don‚Äôt know if this problem occurs because I have logged in for over 1060 days in a row so that my data might be unwieldy or if it is something else. Perhaps the unpaid version uses slower servers. A real shame because I started using the app to lose weight because of health issues. Would hate to finally toss it for another app.

Title: MFP is going downhill...
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using this app successfully for more than two years. However, the last few updates seem to be making the app less user-friendly. This morning I'm frustrated just trying to rearrange a few items in my breakfast list. When trying to edit the list and move an item up or down, the item gets stuck until I close and reopen the app. The item landed in the wrong place and I had to repeat five times just to get the item where I wanted it. In addition, when adding items to a list, the twirly thing in the upper left corner makes me wait way too long before I can add the next item. This process is way too slow. This app worked much better back in version 2. You're making the app more complicated than it needs to be. Please fix these issues or I may have to start looking elsewhere. When it was Version 2, I would have given a 5-star rating. I can only give 1-star at this time, but I'm willing to reevaluate after the app has been fixed.

Title: Home Screen Changed For Worse
----------------------------------------------------------
MFP supposedly wants users to use their app to track their daily nutrition, but forces blog posts and other useless information to be the "default" display on the Home screen. Previous versions of the app showed a terrific nutritional snapshot of the current diary log. Now the option to change your Home screen content has been removed from the app Settings (you can remove their stock "blog posts" but are still forced to see a mandatory newsfeed instead of your nutritional data). Mandatorily removing the very information the app is intended to track and instead forcing a Facebook-type newsfeed clearly shows that MFP is more interested in being a quasi social media app instead of the powerful nutritional tracking app it once was. I realize this is a free app. But come on. Please bring back the old diary feature to the Home screen and stop trying to be another Facebook with this mandatory newsfeed garbage.

Title: User experience from bad to worse
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using this app for a while now. Granted, I've been using the free version, but the app has been surreptitiously sneaking in the most vile and obnoxious methods of advertising, most certainly as a mechanism to incentivize me to upgrade to a paid version. Marketers should offer me more features to make me want to spend money, not auto redirect to the App Store to buy 'game of war' over and over again. Seriously, this is what prompted me to finally write this review. I sat in horror as I sat, hands free, on the diary page as the app sent me to be App Store-I'd 'return to my fitness pal' wait three seconds and be returned to the store... I was also hit with a modal alert recently alerting me that I was a prize winner and was directed to the App Store to download Hulu-I can't even enter my foods for the morning because as I type I am redirected every few seconds. This is an abysmal user experience

Title: Frankly stupid
----------------------------------------------------------
Tried to switch from the MyPlate app to this one solely because this app's icon is slightly less ugly. The app itself if impossible and full of stupidity. I try to add how much water I've had and the only measurement option is cups. Huh? I'm drinking a bottle of water, not boiling it. Every new entry requires you to enter a 'brand' for the food you're eating. I almost exclusively cook my own meals or get takeout from local restaurants, so why can't I ever skip this option? I think this was designed for someone who only eats McDonalds and Lean Cuisine. Now I've entered a whole day's worth of data and the home screen is still mostly blank. What goes here? If you're looking for a functioning calorie tracking app, try MyPlate. The icon is a little ugly but it isn't full of the stupidity in this app and you can see a pie chart of your protein, fat and carbs on the home screen. Infinitely more useful.

Title: What a Terrible App
----------------------------------------------------------
First off I would like to say this is my first ever review and what a terrible app this is. I signed up for the premium version today, thinking I would be able to track my calories.  First I run into an issue on their website, which wouldn‚Äôt allow me to input foods into the food diary (seems like kind of an important function of a calorie tracker).  I say okay, maybe this is just a website error.  I download the app, and attempt to log in from there, to which the app pops up with a message ‚Äúthis app can not connect to the server‚Äù. Now I‚Äôm frustrated, so I email their support to to ask for a refund and cancellation of the premium version I just paid for, since neither the app nor website seems to function, from there I get an automated reply saying I need to contact Apple to get a refund and they can help me out.   What an overall terrible experience. Don‚Äôt waste your money.

Title: Still no dark mode.
----------------------------------------------------------
While a great app in many ways it‚Äôs been far too many years to excuse the lack of dark mode so will continue to mark each release as 1 star until this is fixed. And employing all friends and family to do the same. Also most science recommends the amount of protein you eat is based on you weight. Such .7 to 1g per lb of body weight. If you set to grams for protein however there is no way to set percents for carbs and fat which is so frustrating. And unlike competitors such as Lifesum it only imports workout active energy you can‚Äôt have it import your daily resting energy which for those of us who wear an Apple Watch all day is far more accurate than choosing the generic how active are you buckets. Since this app continues to be sold unless apple buys it someday I doubt expect to see any of these long standing issues fixed since design of mfp has never been its strong suit.

Title: I used to love this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I swore by this app. It kept me thinking about everything I ate and the amount of exercise I was performing. I liked it so much that I could forgive the increasingly slow performance, but this last "update" was the last straw. The nutrition data used to show the numbers needed for healthy eating decisions, now all you get are vague bar graphs. I  knew it was pointless, but I sent a request to customer support to see if I could downgrade to the previous version and was essentially told that I should give it some time and I'll get used to the new layout. Why would I want to get used to an inferior product? If I'm not getting the information I want, why should I just settle?  After trying a few other fitness/calorie tracker apps, I ended up with MyNetDiary. It provides more nutrition data than fitness pal ever did. The latest update drove me away, you should avoid this mess

Title: App did not count the values correctly anymore after this last update
----------------------------------------------------------
As a premium member I am very irritated that an app that was perfect before this update, which touted ‚Äúfull of bug fixes‚Äù is now full of mistakes.  The update should aptly be labeled ‚ÄúFull of bugs‚Äù. The carb counts on most line items were not calculated correctly and the total numbers at the bottom were wrong.  I put the same food yesterday, and the counts between yesterday and today after the update were totally different.  It doesn‚Äôt even make sense, the manual count of the line items for the carbs showed 34 and the bottom total number for the carbs was showing 5 today!  When I wrote tech support, he tried to tell me that it was the mistake of the database for not having the info on the fiber and sugar alcohol and not the app itself.  Well if I were a free user, I will just switch to another app. I might cancel my premium soon if it isn‚Äôt fixed in a few days.

Title: Macros and calories don‚Äôt add up
----------------------------------------------------------
The app has the wrong information for your calories and macros. I just noticed yesterday that my macros did not look like I hit my goal for the day. But the app said I was over on my calorie goal. So I decided to check myself. Carbs and protein count as 4 calories per gram and fats count as 9 calories per gram. If you check your numbers at the end of the day on the app, it is wrong. In my case, I was short about 130 calories. I addressed this with tech help, and they blamed it on the user error of people entering wrong macro and calorie info. This is incorrect and laziness on tech help‚Äôs part. I am canceling my subscription and will not pay for an app that does not do what it is advertised to do. I would not recommend this app if you are serious about your diet and nutrition goals. The margin of error is too high to reach your nutrient goals successfully.

Title: Premium Subscription but Premium features aren‚Äôt working
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve had the premium subscription for over a year with no issues until about a month ago. I love the feature to track macros daily. And now I can‚Äôt use the feature. My app is updated. I‚Äôve tapped the three buttons on the top right and ensured the the settings are correct. But when I go to the ‚Äúdiary‚Äù it only show Calories Left at the top. I‚Äôve logged out and logged back in. I‚Äôve deleted the app and reloaded it. I‚Äôve cancelled my subscription and renewed it. That worked for like and hour before it reverted back. I keep getting banners up upgrade to premium when I already and and the ads are there. When I click on the banner to upgrade it says YoU aLrEaDY HaVe tHe SuBScRiPtIoN. So I‚Äôm at a loss. I‚Äôve reached out to customer service and have not received a response (another ‚Äúpremium feature‚Äù that‚Äôs not working). So yes. Please fix this soon. Please.

Title: STOP COUNTING
----------------------------------------------------------
Counting calories will mess with your head, and the apps that focus on every small detail: carbs, fat, protein, calories, and  steps taken, will make you become fixated  with numbers rather than focus on realistic, healthy, and obtainable goals.  Please, stop counting calories. Just eat healthy and stay active and you will be fine. Preoccupying yourself with all things food will make you miserable, and will make it even harder to lose/maintain weight. This goes for ALL apps, but I used My Fitness Pal for a few months, and even though it helped me lose weight (arguably even too much), I am still trying to rebound from the emotional and mental damage that dieting (A.K.A restricting my food food all day) has done to me. Do yourself a favor and safe yourself from the same damage by not using any dumb app that tells you what you can and can't eat.

Title: GLITCHES
----------------------------------------------------------
The app needs to update and have some serious bug fixes. It has so many glitches. I have had a few friends encounter the same problems and switch to Lose It because of how annoying it is. It often delete 1-2 days a week of data. And sometimes it carries yesterday's foods over into today and then you have to delete them all before adding in today's. Also, having it sync with Fitbit my calories burned by exercise drops. It says "burned 500". Then check 2 hours later and it's like burned "462". It's so inconsistent. I look the UI and the certified foods. I believe in MFP but I wish they would UPDATE the app to fix these bugs. I also wish there had 2 features of lose it--date you will reach your goal, instead of "if every day were like today you would weigh ____ in 5 weeks" and also a composite view of a weekly average of calories and nutrients!

Title: Continuously Un-Syncs From Fitbit
----------------------------------------------------------
Not sure if it‚Äôs only a problem with FitBit users, or non-premium members, but MyFitnessPal is ALWAYS missing my FitBt steps. Considering I wanted to used this app to track my health and walking is a big part of my daily health goals, having this miss my steps throws off my goals. Although I can still track what I eat and MANUALLY enter my calories burned through exercise, it‚Äôs been such a hassle to go onto the MyFitnessPal website, disconnect my FitBit, reconnect it, and re-sync it in the app. I‚Äôve done it twice just this last week and today it won‚Äôt even update my steps. It‚Äôs been an ongoing problem for this app with many users for at least over a year and still hasn‚Äôt been resolved. There have been many updates to the app but this seems to have not been prioritized. I will likely just stop using this app, it‚Äôs just not worth the trouble.

Title: Incredibly useless!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
The latest release, which I received on 13 December, 2015, is unusable. It takes over 5 minutes to log in and sync, and I must repeatedly act to keep the iPhone from going to sleep while it churns away. If I fail to keep the iPhone awake, the whole process starts from the beginning. I've tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling the app, which helped a bit; but the benefit was reducing the login to two interruptions of my iPhone trying to sleep instead of more than five, and I was only able to enter one food item. It stalled out when I tried to enter a second item. Whether this is an issue with the app or with the back end, I don't know. I only know I have no choice but to use the website until this is corrected. I am replacing my formerly five star review with this one star review because I can't give it zero stars. It's that bad!

Title: It keeps dropping my calorie limit!
----------------------------------------------------------
Guess I should have wrote this review two weeks ago when I was happy with the MyFitnessPal app. This week not so much.  The app just dropped the calorie limit for both my husband and myself, and not just starting this week but all the way back so that it appears I have  been overeating (into the negative calories) since I began tracking in earnest in January! I was losing weight just and eating nutritionally just fine at 1200 calories. Why the shift down to 1080?? Yes, I can find any food in their vast food database, which was why I began using this app in the first place, but now I am so disheartened everyday when I find myself in the red maintaining my original limit 1200 calories that I don't want to use this anymore. What a disappointment!! Going down to 1080? Why did I need to? The plan to lose a pound a week was working  at 1200!

Title: Pretty laughable in my opinion
----------------------------------------------------------
If I am paying a premium subscription fee for a service, then that‚Äôs exactly what I expect to get.. a service. Meaning I would like recommendations and a layout built for me to help lead me in the right direction of the types of meals that I should eat to reach the goals I have selected. This app is essentially nothing more than having a diary and keeping track of food you eat... for almost $80 a year. Lol, It seems like I may be the only one who finds that hilarious, but I can easily do that myself with a pen and paper and not have to spend any money at all. Not to mention, I have seen many other completely free apps out there with literally the exact same things to offer. If you want to throw your money down the toilet, that‚Äôs up to you. But I‚Äôd rather put it towards something that will actually create a meaningful impact.

Title: Latest update did something to battery
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this app, though I confess logging my calories can get tedious and I don't always do it. Right now is a period of not doing it, so I haven't opened the app in days. The other day my phone's battery was draining very fast for no apparent reason, even when plugged in! I checked usage and found that MyFitnessPal was to blame. There had been an update that day (4/6/16). I turned off background app activity but the problem still wasn't solved. My battery was dying and my phone was warm and I hadn't even opened the app! I deleted it completely and everything immediately got better. Phone stayed alive at 7% battery for hours. I have the app on my iPad too and that version seems fine. I also have an Apple Watch so maybe there's a connection? Anyway, I won't. Be reinstalling until this gets fixed, which is too bad.

Title: Used to be good but now ....
----------------------------------------------------------
After the latest update, it now takes you automatically to the page in the App Store to download games....without even clicking on the ads. Yes, I get that you guys need ads and I noticed the new installation of these on the screen, but disrupting my food input to change screens to get me to download games??? Come on guys. You can do better than this. And charging so much for the app to be ad free? In my opinion, not worth it. Also it would be cool if you could do "meal #1, meal #2, meal #3" etc for us bodybuilders that don't adhere to a strict breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack regimen. Not everyone is on the same plan. It's hard to track what I had for pre and post workout when it's all grouped together and it looks like I consumed a 1,000 in one sitting. Needs improvement. Used to be good, but nah, not anymore.

Title: So disappointed with recent changes
----------------------------------------------------------
So I started using the app a few years ago, but most foods wouldn't scan and the app wasn't that convenient so I didn't fully utilize it. When going back to it recently I was pleasantly surprised by the updates, my intake was easy to track and even many more local obscure foods scanned. HOWEVER, I could not be more disappointed by the recent May update. I have to subscribe now to add protein, carbs, etc. for simple features such as quick add!? I would even be willing to pay something like 2.99 for this app full featured, but no way I'm ever going to pay for a $50 yearly subscription just to access basic features. Even though if you look at cost per month, the price is not very high I'm never in my life going to spend that much at one time to use a basic app EVER especially when I feel that it's taking advantage.

Title: Not happy with the update!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using the app for just over 150 days straight and have successfully lost 32 pounds.... I follow iifym and that is so much harder now with how the nutrient page is set up! It takes up too much space and takes too long to figure out how many macros I have left. The pie chart is no help at all. Please change back to a one page version where we see clear cut #s. The little bar that fills just takes up space. Or make an option to choose the format! I think also being able to choose which nutrients you view would be helpful also. I don't want to keep track of some of those (Saturated fat for example) and I should be able to disable that so it shows me the ones I am truly interested in!  I can't continue to use this app the way it's currently set up. Definitely a downgrade- not upgrade!! It was fine before!

Title: HATE recent app changes
----------------------------------------------------------
So many of us long-time users HATE the latest changes to the app.  It USED to be user friendly, but somebody, not too bright, decided to make the app more complicated with useless charts that slow the app down mercilessly.  Unless they bring back the older user friendly version that MOST of its users have been asking for, I predict a mass exodus to someone smart enough to put a similar user friendly version out there for us.  I know I'm just waiting around daily to see how they handle this or to see someone else steals their older version and gets all of us to change over.  Greed always DOES eventually kill off a business .. And this one, by adding an expensive "premium" level to get back some of the functionality it once offered/provided for free, has started ringing its own death toll in my humble opinion.

Title: The app doesn't care about you - it cares about selling in-apps to you and sell your data
----------------------------------------------------------
It has been a while since I used this app. Was curious about tracking diet and exercise again as I prep for work. However, the app is not the same as it was. Now, I find the app very annoying. There is too much crap on the home screen. I just want to see my data. Also, every click and swipe is yelling at me to go premium. Know what, I was fine without using the app. Now, instead of just deleting the app, I question if I ever would use My Fitness Pal again in the future if this is how the app will be and how MyFitnessPal values my relationship as a user. MyFitnessPal is no longer about me and my health, it is all about monetizing my data and getting me to buy unnecessary app add-ins and selling my "views" to advertisers on an unwanted "newsfeed" that can not be removed or taken off the homepage/dashboard.

Title: Hidden Agendas
----------------------------------------------------------
Gave the app at least one star because it is handy to keep track of calories. It is also the most suggested by physicians to help in weight loss.  How ever, since using this app I have started to receive many unsolicited email for products, books and websites and articles that seem very tailored to some of the specific information I have provided on my diary. Specifically on brand names of food products I scanned into my food diary. When I received an email for an alcohol detox facility (I only drink on average of 2x per week an 1-2 drinks over a 4-5 hour period) obviously Big Brother is scouring this app for personal habits and applying arm chair psychoanalysis as to our lifestyle. I will know delete this app and register under yet a new private email. All my entries will be vague as in calories only.

Title: They‚Äôve made the app almost useless
----------------------------------------------------------
Foods and recipes I‚Äôve created have completely disappeared, and recently the search function has become unusable. I can type foods exactly as they have appeared in my past diary entries and 99% of the time I only get one food that matches a single word that I‚Äôve typed mixed in with a bunch of completely unrelated items. The only way to enter food for items that I haven‚Äôt eaten in the past few weeks is to manually enter every time or scan the barcode. The search function used to work great, so this is a very recent change. I only switched to MyFitnessPal because of the ease of search and storage of recent foods and recipes. Now that none of these features work and my items have been deleted (along with the weight logs I had dating back eight years) there is absolutely no reason to keep using this app.

Title: Um... why?
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm 14 and can‚Äôt use the app?? I mean I get it if the age limit was maybe 13+, but this I don‚Äôt get. There are so many teens out there who want to stay fit. And honestly, it‚Äôs most critical to stay fit and develop good, healthy habits during teen years, especially considering this is when most of the physical and brain development is occurring. I strongly suggest that you rethink your choice of only allowing people 18 and up to sign up. I really hope that you take this into consideration. I was super excited when I found out what this app could be used for and it has such great reviews. However, the excited vanished as soon as I met this sudden issue of not being able to make an account. Please rethink this. Thank you for putting aside time to read this; your response would be greatly appreciated.

Title: Calorie Counts Way Off
----------------------------------------------------------
I wondered why I didn't seem to be losing very much weight and tonight I found out why. I ate at Bonefish Grill and very carefully chose my food from the apps' menu so I could stay within my allotted calories for the day. Much to my surprise the menu I received had the calories for each item printed next to it. When I added up the calories from the menu and compared them to the app the app was 260 calories UNDER. If all my meals are this far off it's no wonder I'm not losing much weight. I'm about ready to scrap the app and do something else. Since the last update the steps has become totally screwed up. Today it showed me with 2 calories burned. I also use 2 other apps for comparison purposes. They were many times this count. What is happening with this app?  It seems to be going down the tubes.

What happened? I was on a roll with my goals for a month now (2 year member), all meals are typed in and set, and now the apps been crashing all day. Finally got online with my computer and as a put in my data on that slow site I noticed that the dinner and snack sections are gone! No drop down or section anywhere, I just put it all under lunch and figured if the app worked tonight I would change the sections to dinner and snacks. I did get in the app finally and tried to adjust the food to the right sections but the dinner and snacks are missing from there too! Then I looked at my past months data and all my food is in breakfast now for my past dinner and snacks! Help fix asap.... Loved the app before now I am afraid to add any data just in case I have to switch to another calorie tracking app.

Title: OMG - it‚Äôs a marketing tool
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm sure the paid version is as good as everyone says but forget taking it for a free spin to check it out first. They have the most aggressive ad campaign I‚Äôve ever seen on an app. It was almost unusable because of the constant interference from multiple ads in multiple formats on each and every page - to buy everything from the application itself to clothes. It won‚Äôt  show the price of joining until you actually sign up for a trial period that automatically renews itself, through your iTunes account. You have to give up some pretty important health details that I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone else have. I am tired of having to give up my personal info to get apps that just want to sell to you. I‚Äôm at the point where there‚Äôs a line that I can‚Äôt step over any more. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it just on principle.

Title: I‚Äôm confused.
----------------------------------------------------------
I got this app to help me on my weight loss journey. I thought it would be best for me to track my food as I have trouble of over eating and all. I haven‚Äôt gotten any other apps or gone on any other website to help me yet so I needed to sign up. I put what I need for the first two or three slides of signing up (I signed up with email) but when it comes to the page for me telling my birthday and gender and all I click the arrow and it keeps saying it can‚Äôt make my registration at the moment or something. So I was like okay and tried a few more times and it said the same thing. It is now the next day and I‚Äôm trying to sign up and it won‚Äôt let me. Is it my age? Did I do something wrong? Is it my WiFi? I even turned on my data to see if that would work. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm confused.

Title: Really? You overlooked the recipe section
----------------------------------------------------------
I actually love this app, but I'm giving a one-star rating in order to get someone's attention that there has been a gross negligence in the recipe section. It is very easy to make a mistake and add a recipe before finishing all the ingredients, but it is completely impossible to modify or delete a recipe once it has been added. Seriously? Now I have one recipe for an Indian dish I make and two for taco salad sitting in my recipe list that are absolutely useless. I can't do anything with them and I can't get rid of them. Please fix this before the next update. This problem is very very VERY annoying. Other than that, I'm very happy I found the app and it has been very useful. If not for this grievous oversight which is causing me serious consternation, I would give a 5 star rating.

Title: don't use this app unless you are a secure, responsible adult
----------------------------------------------------------
my best friend does modeling and is always desperate to lose weight. she uses this app. unfortunately, she's the type of person who will do ANYTHING to lose weight, even rigorous dieting and exercise. we found out that she had been doing intense workouts for 3 hours a day and with her schoolwork didn't have time for more than 7 hours of sleep. obviously this was making her exhausted. however, we discovered that this app had been telling her that she needed to cut down to 1200 some calories a day. for a developing teenage girl, that is starving yourself. my issue with this app is that there is no limit to how few calories a day it assigned. this is particularly dangerous for young, impressionable teenagers who are looking for a way to drop weight. if I could give it a zero, I would

After weeks of on/off communication w MFP support they have not been able to help me regain access to my account. It‚Äôs like it never existed. The app and web logins tell me I have entered invalid user/password. A reset email is never received even though I get all other emails from MFP including ones for a new account I created. MFP doesn‚Äôt find my account... only my the new account I created a week ago.  Also I recently purchased the year paid version and no longer have access to it. Because it‚Äôs been over 60 days Apple can refund my money, MFP can‚Äôt transfer to a new account and the only way I may get my money back is to do a dispute with my credit card. Which I will attempt but really I just want my account back with a decade of data (history, meals, recipes etc). Disappointed.

Title: Warning: Once you are in, you are stuck
----------------------------------------------------------
I tried Fitness Pal for a few weeks. Once the data breach happened, I tried to delete my account, but no matter how many times I tried, it would not let me. I kept getting an error message. When I tried to reset my password, the email link never arrived. After emailing the company four times to request that my account and personal data be deleted, they finally responded to note that they would review my request. I never received a response, and although I have attempted to contact their customer care team additional times, these requests have gone unanswered. So, just be aware. If you use this app and store personal information about your health and wellness there, it seems almost impossible to undo this action. They have this data and seem unresponsive to their customers.

Title: Terribly Unreliable Release
----------------------------------------------------------
I just upgraded to Premium. It has potential but its unreliability automatically gives it a 0/5; this release is pathetically buggy. My biggest annoyance is that the macro computation on the ‚ÄúMacronutrient Dashboard‚Äù is unreliable. Macros per meal are computed correctly in your diary but for some reason it can‚Äôt then (1) add macros from all your meals together, (2) subtract them from your daily goals, (3) display the remaining macros up on top on your Dashboard. I have no idea what it‚Äôs computing but every single category is wrong 100% of the time: net carbs, fat, and protein. What‚Äôs the point of promoting Custom Dashboard as a premium feature when it can‚Äôt do this very basic thing correctly and it forces you to do it by hand or risk everyday or risk missing your goals.

Title: Obnoxious new ads ruin what was once a great app
----------------------------------------------------------
I used and loved this app for 5+ years, recommending it to anyone who was interested in healthier living and weight loss. Ads are something that come along with apps, but myfitnesspal has taken it to another level with their new ridiculous banner ads that follow you around in the diary meal sections based in your activity. These new ads obstruct the diary view and pop up right in time for you to accidentally hit them instead of the section of the diary you were intending to get into. I tried to tell myfitnesspal about how bothersome this new advertising has become, but they blew me off and spun BS about the importance of ads. Yes, I get that ads are needed to fund the progress and development of the app, but not at the expense of the quality of the program it's self.

I have written customer support about issues with this application multiple times and have received the same ‚Äúplease uninstall and then reinstall‚Äù answer. This ‚Äúsolution‚Äù no longer works. Every day I receive a notification that the app cannot sync with the server and the data is saved locally, and it isn‚Äôt. I will add items into recipes from my phone and they do not save. I will then go and attempt to adjust recipes from my laptop and these changes save, but do not update on the phone application. This is beyond frustrating and an ongoing issue. Stop bugging me to purchase a premium subscription when basic functionality consistently fails. NOTE: I had purchased premium in the past an experienced the same issues which is even more ridiculous for your paying customers.

Title: A very nice 5 star app now a piece of junk!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
The past two versions...especially the newest have become a pain to use. The screens have changed but show no additional/different information. As a matter of fact, there is less information unless the premium version is purchased...once a year! The buttons have moved and require more interaction to access. But, the most aggravating thing to me is the constant accessing online with every entry and page change, this delays the next step...especially in areas of slow/spotty Internet access. Also, just loading the app takes up to 45 seconds in my service area because of it having to phone home every time it needs to... And their customer support s**ks!!! I very much liked the original versions better. Support staff are worthless providing nothing but lip service.

Title: Haven't been able to connect to server due to advertisements
----------------------------------------------------------
The recent update allows ads to hijack your phone. They automatically reroute you to the App Store as you are trying to log food. Not cool. The ads also freeze the app. Last night a pop up came onto the screen as I was logging food to tell me I was a "chosen winner" and "click here" to redeem my prize. There was no way to exit that screen without clicking the link so I deleted the app and reinstalled it. Now the app says it cannot connect the server so I've been unable to use it to log from my log. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app three times. Seriously frustrated. I've used MyFitnessPal for three years straight, during and after my weight loss journey, and the quality of use is decreasing because of the ads. Might be time to find something else üòû

Title: Appalling
----------------------------------------------------------
DO NOT USE, ‚ÄúUnderarm‚Äù RUINED THIS APP!!! I used MFP in 2013 to successfully lose weight, before it was turned into a $20 a month for premium mockery. The original app was amazing and community powered and genuinely good for people. Now it‚Äôs a shadow of its former self and designed only to sell the Outrageously Overpriced ‚Äúpremium features‚Äù, which you will be constantly reminded of. Lose it, one of the competing apps, also is constantly reminding you of premium features, but the app is less than half the price of this one, and just as robust if not more... so I just deleted this and actually paid them instead. There was a 50% off premium annual sub for Lose it when I joined today, so I got a whole year for $20... UnderArmor, I think you owe us an apology.

Title: Riddled with bugs - not worth the $9.99/month
----------------------------------------------------------
I only gave it one star because there‚Äôs no option for zero stars. Over the past three months of use, this app continually doubles up my macros and calories in Apple health which affects other apps I‚Äôm using to track my health. This seems to happen on a completely random basis. After submitting multiple reports to tech support I only get a generic reply back thanking me for my feedback and someone will be in touch. Apparently MFP developers have known about this since October 2017 and still haven‚Äôt fixed it. Requires the user to continually double check Apple health data against what is reported in MFP. This app is garbage at the moment and not worth the 9.99 Per month. If you are going to charge me for it, at least make the thing work. Very disappointing.

Title: Can't believe it's free!
----------------------------------------------------------
Update:  Oh, how I loved this app before the update in May 2015.  The interface for the nutrients is so confusing now. Did they actually test this out on someone besides their programmers before they launched it?  It's awful now. What used to be so simple and straight forward is a mess.  I used to love logging what I eat and seeing how it fit into the nutrient goals for the day and week.  It's so confusing now that I no longer want to use it.  It was helping me so much but now with the updates that ruined it, I'll be looking for something else. I was so motivated to use it before and now that they've complicated it and made it so confusing, I avoid using it. Please, please, bring back the old interface to the nutrient section. You ruined a wonderful app.

Title: A Bloated, Buggy, Battery-Draining Mess
----------------------------------------------------------
As a long-time user of this app, I am saddened at how little it has improved over the years. The database can rarely be depended on, including the entries that are allegedly verified; and unfortunately there are many weird interface quirks and bugs that make manual data entry unnecessarily difficult. Once you manage to actually make an entry, though, there are constant syncing errors. Then, if the app is open long enough (and it will be if you care about accurately entering data) your phone will overheat or the app will just crash. It‚Äôs weird how this app always seems to have a new update, yet none of these problems are ever fixed. The only reason I still use the app is because it has years of my data. I‚Äôm not sure that is a good enough reason anymore.

Title: Red meat??
----------------------------------------------------------
I thought the red meat issue was a thing of the past. It seems this app only caters to one type of eating...High carb low fat no animal tissue. Guess what folks, to build tissue..eat tissue. That is the purest way to find nutrition. Let the cows do the work for you eating all that fibrous grass. We are animals and not exempt to the animal kingdom. Live in the world not in La la land. Get educated on both side of the line and find what‚Äôs best for you. Don‚Äôt be fooled by someone else spouting off rhetoric from someone they trusted who they thought they knew what they were doing but really, they didn‚Äôt. You‚Äôll see when you try both ways of eating. Just find what gives you the most freedom. Not eating animal products is a religion and not a way of health.

We learned to eat healthier we were more active, it helped us to make better choices. I have in the past 6 months had 2 operations and have gained 40 lbs back ‚òπÔ∏è I reloaded the my fitness pal app and was very disappointed.

Slowness, constant freezes, the limited function in notification list (eg. You can get push notification or email on ‚Äúsomeone commented on a post you comment on‚Äù, but you cannot find it in the Notification Center of the app - hence you can never go back to those post to interact withe people), there is no tag function, photo posting process is very not intuitive and very cumbersome... etc. and those bottom line performance issues seem never be the priority of the app improvement. If one day I stop using this app, it will be because I‚Äôm fed up with all the frustration it causes...

Syncing between the Gear Tracker, US Record app,MyFitnessPal, MapMyRun, and MapMyRide IS A COMPLICATED MESS.  especially if you are trying to log on with the computer (desktop mode) vs mobile mode / my phone (where I can't "add workouts" or "add miles" to my Gear Tracker if I use my running shoes for a jog without using the app at the same time.)  I had multiple accounts / multiple identities depending on which app or tracker i used at which time in my life and on which device over the last few years.  I asked for help in consolidating these accounts and streamlining the issues four times and customer service via email was never helpful.    it is a mess.  After finally deleting all connection to UA apps, my frustrations have disappeared as well.

Title: Downhill Since Under Armour
----------------------------------------------------------
I've used MyFitnessPal for years, and I always recommended it to others. However, since Under Armour bought the app, it's become one giant ad. They want you to pay $10 a month or $50 a year for their "Premium Service" (talk about forcing you to buy a year...) and if you don't, you cannot click anywhere on anything without seeing ads or reminders to buy Premium. They literally put ads between your meals, so you can't even look at your meal tracker without their pushy crap. The app still has a decent database, and the basic functionality is there. But the app is less about fitness and more about Under Armour squeezing every penny out of the user, and forcing an awkward ad-ridden interface on them when the user won't pay up. What a disappointment.

Title: Ads have become maddeningly intrusive
----------------------------------------------------------
This used to be an excellent app that helped me lose weight and get in shape, but it has seriously gone downhill recently. The functionality is still there, but the ads have become so intrusive it can be difficult to use. For example, ads in the food diary are placed very close to buttons you need to tap which often results in accidentally tapping the ad instead. At other times auto play videos pop up, sometimes repeatedly. And most recently, it insists on opening the App Store and imploring me to download ridiculous games. At times simply entering my meals in the diary becomes a frustrating game of whack a mole with the ads. I'm on the search for a new app that will track my food without all the intrusive ads. I'm done with My Fitness Pal.

The original, free, ad-free version was perfection.  Aside from the many incorrect entries you'd occasionally run across, and even incorrect barcode associations.  But now, with all the bloated ads all over the place, the advertisement videos that continually pop up full screen when in my diary, and the LUDICROUS price of $10/mo for the privilege of getting rid of the ads and a few additional functions (e.g. Which food today had the most protein?)...it's really lame.  BUT...still worth wading through the nonsense to track your calories.  Just wish it hadn't been bought by underarmor and turned into a money grab.  I'd gladly pay a 1-time fee for the premium version...say $5.  But $10/mo is so stupid.  You greedy goofs.  I'll never pay that.

I have been using this app for over 50 days and it has been successful. I loved the app so much that I even had my two daughters download it onto their phones and my husband! But with this new nutrition download I absolutely hate it! It is very confusing and why fix something if it's not broken. I agree with every other video that has been written and I am begging to put it back the way it was please! I cannot say I will not use it but I never ever now look at the nutrition value chart. With all of these reviews I've never seen a comment from you. At least give your uses the courtesy for your reasoning to change the nutrition chart. I will leave my star rating according to the nutrition chart not according to the total app performance.

Title: Bugs and incorrect information
----------------------------------------------------------
Great concept, executed well in some areas, but can be frustrating to use when creating recipes and tracking food. There have been bugs when syncing the app with the Fitbit tracker that render it useless until they resolve, which usually takes days. I find that nearly every time I scan a barcode to log food or create a recipe, the information is inaccurate. I‚Äôm not sure if this is because MyFitnessPal doesn‚Äôt know how to enter the information or because they allow users to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù nutritional facts and most people are stupid. You‚Äôll want to review each entry carefully before saving. If MyFitnessPal could clean up their nutritional database and permanently resolve the syncing issues with Fitbit, it would move my rating to a five star.

Hey. So you're thinking about getting this app. I won't lie, these kind of calorie counting apps work and do get you to your "goal". However, it is important to understand what that these kind of apps are dangerous. When I first got this app I was a teen who wanted to loose weight. I wasn't heavy at all. Yet, I got it anyway in hopes of having an ideal body that many of us simply cannot have. After less than two weeks of using this app, I saw myself nearly starving myself to get to a certain calorie goal. I found myself skipping my favorite meals just to stay under a certain number. Most importantly, I found that I was hungry. All. The. Time. And I refused to eat if it meant I was going to be over my calorie number. It is SO

Just received an email this morning letting me know that all of my information, email, password, profile info had been taken from their site in March. Every app seems to think they require your personal info to, in this case track your calories. If you don‚Äôt give permission then you can‚Äôt use the app as always. Once trusted with your personal information they can‚Äôt even keep it safe. This is happening in more and more cases. These companies as in this case say oops we messed up sorry. Change your passwords and hope for the best. Yet I notice this app is still up in the store with a 4.7 rating. Be warned this company doesn‚Äôt take keeping your personal information safe as a priority. Be very cautious about using this app!!

I have used the app happily for 5 years.   Through all the updates good or not so good, I‚Äôve not complained and eventually gotten used to it.  But the newest update is absolutely horrible.  You changed the interface to ALL BRIGHT WHITE!   Are you kidding?  In a world where almost every application offers a dark mode this is what you came up with? Remove ALL color, and make the screen so bright users are blinded when they open the app unless they dim the screen.  I see no other noticeable changes at all.  Under armor are you listening? The newest update is tanking your rating as we speak.  All 1 star ratings today mention the horrible new interface.  Please give us some color back.  The next update can‚Äôt come fast enough.

Revert back to last version if you cannot fix the link btwn UP24 & MFP, what is the point of sync'd data - if its not sync'd correctly if AT ALL? Ohh & the solution given in tech support delete the MFP App & reinstall to fix the common issues... While you get a warning then "all data will be lost" does that sound like tracking to you? Or starting over from zero!!! Don't waste the time on this App or don't allow App updates! If we cannot rate zero stars then give me minus stars option!! -5 here

Title: Used to love this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I have to take the time to echo what others are saying.  I used to live on this app daily as it was a critical part of my fat loss and lean muscle gain success.  I relied heavily on the macro breakdown stats and graph to ensure I was on target every day. Protein/fat/carb breakdown just as important if not more critical than simple calorie breakdowns by meal.  From what I can gather, I'm now expected to pay 9.99/month for the same information now.  I would certainly be willing to pay for a premium one time cost for the app, but the monthly fee is ridiculous.  I'm now hoping to find another app that works as well as this one used to.  Clearly those in charge of the redesign of this app did not understand their audience.

Title: Expand, embrace, explode
----------------------------------------------------------
They "updated" their app with adds to save their VC funding, and some extraneous "features" to sell the change. Now it bombs every other time I run it. I have a 1.5 year old iPhone and I am not prepared to plop down $500 every year to keep up with junior app companies. Trying to save their funding. Caloriecount did that and I dropped it. This one's next. Save yourself trouble and look for apps from Germany and Scandinavia, where people program for the hell of it and are supported by the community through the welfare state. Everyone there wins with great products, e.g. Linux, and no worries about where their funding will come from to pay the rent. Here only the markets win. Terrible app because it doesn't work anymore.

Title: Premium pricing skirting developer rules?
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there. App is good and I would subscribe to premium but the price I see in app is $79, if I log in to the website I see $49. Weird that that‚Äôs the basically the exact amount difference you‚Äôd pay in commission to Apple in the app store. So strange. I don‚Äôt want to have my credit card in multiple places, would prefer to go through Apple subscription. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll give me some nonsense about how you test different prices and features and a/b testing blah blah but this feels super weird and not how the appstore rules are supposed to work. On top of all that, if I go in to my subscriptions from settings I see a $49 option but if I choose that, the app doesn‚Äôt recognize my subscription and offers me a premium at $79.

Title: Lots of features but distracting to use for free
----------------------------------------------------------
New review; since creating the food database for free from users MFP has now introduced their premium service so for 999 monthly or $49 for the year you can pay for all of the services below that were once free.  If you try to continue with the free app as I had been using for many years you end up with multiple add interruptions always looking to do track your goal by offering you food that's unhealthy or other things like beer and other diet distractions.  Another thing that's been taken away is that you were unable to see what your macros look like per day per meal there used to be a way that you'd be able to view each items content just like looking at a nutrition label and it will tally it up based on the meal.

Title: Constant state of freeze
----------------------------------------------------------
This app used to be great. Over the last year, it‚Äôs become more and more unreliable, freezing EVERY time I switch over to another app, or right after I open the app, or while I‚Äôm in the middle of using the app, or even when I just look at the app. Most of this, I‚Äôm pretty sure, is due to the app CONSTANTLY trying to load ads, in an effort to get me to upgrade to the premium version. But guess what, if one version works like this, I‚Äôm danged sure not going to pay money to see if the other does any better, especially since it also refuses to communicate with several of the developer‚Äôs other apps, such as MapMyWalk and MapMyFitness. I‚Äôve been using this app for years, but I think it‚Äôs high time to push it to the curb.

Title: Great tool, when it‚Äôs working
----------------------------------------------------------
This app makes keeping track of your calories very easy; the database of foods is huge (though not always accurate) and you can even scan barcodes or add the nutritional info for a food you can‚Äôt find. You can also create recipes or import recipes from the web, which is great if you do a lot of cooking. HOWEVER, MyFitnessPal has been regularly having issues syncing with wearables for YEARS! They are apparently ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù this through 2021 after it happened again in January (That was resolved on 2/8 but I just started having issues again today). They have a paid premium version that has even more features; I don‚Äôt know about anyone else, but considering the regularity of these issues I would never consider it.

Title: Lost all my progresss
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using this app to log my steps since it counts my steps every day and organizes it. Usually it always has problem syncing the steps to the graph, so uninstall the app and reinstall the app. Usually this works and syncs the steps, but yesterday no matter how much I uninstall and reinstall the app it won‚Äôt sync the steps and in fact it made it say 0 steps. I kept deleting and redownloading the app until it worked... and it did... it synced my walking for that day... but IT WIPED OUT EVERY OTHER LOG SINCE FEBURARY!! üò°üò°üò°Now when I look at every day I‚Äôve been walking... it says I walked 0 steps! no matter what setting I changed, no matter how many times i installed and reinstalled, it won‚Äôt go back to normal!

Title: Completely inaccurate calorie goals
----------------------------------------------------------
I used several BMR calculators and each one gave me a higher calorie count for weight loss than MFP app did. There is no way to edit the daily calorie goal to specifically fit a prescribed diet. There is also no edit/delete buttons so if you add something by mistake it remains on your log. Calorie goals are the same 1200 regardless if you want to lose 1.5 or 2 lbs per day? Not scientific and anyone who has taken a nutrition class would know that 1200 calories per day or below is starvation. The body goes into survival mode. This app is dangerous and promotes unhealthy eating habits. You are better off using an accurate BMR calculator online and counting your own calories! Would give it zero stars if I could!

Title: Lazy programming
----------------------------------------------------------
The only reason I'm giving this app 2 stars instead of 1 is due to the amazing community of supporters I've developed on MFP over the years. I appreciate the ability to track foods (such as it is) and, when my Fitbit syncs properly, integrating steps into my day as well. However, this app could be so much better in terms of food tracking (it's clunky) and also reliable notifications for comments. We never know from one day to the next what may not be functioning properly, with info and posts disappearing and sometimes the inability to post at all. If MFP would get its act together and up its game, it would be unstoppable. As it is now, we're all hoping some other developer comes in and kicks MFP to the curb.

Title: Email already in use vs. email doesn‚Äôt exist. Endless loop
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used FP several years ago and really liked it.  Recently I downloaded the app again and was looking forward to using it but when I tried to log in it says ‚Äúemail doesn't exist‚Äù.  So then I tried signing up again and it says ‚Äúemail already in use‚Äù.  The ‚Äúforgot password‚Äù  button is of no help. I went to the website and tried to contact customer service but guess what.....you have to log in first.  I would love to use this app but they have created an endless loop which you can not escape if you have signed up in the past.  And no, I won‚Äôt create a new email just to use this app.  I can‚Äôt positively rate an app that won‚Äôt let me use it.  If they can get me past this, I‚Äôm sure my review would be glowing.

Title: Terrible Customer Service
----------------------------------------------------------
I just cancelled my Premium membership with MyFitnessPal because their customer service is atrocious. The app has problems with syncing regularly, and I had to reach out to their customer service three times over the last month. That alone isn‚Äôt a big deal, but the way their reps handle problems was incredibly frustrating and disappointing. They simply copy and paste messages without reading your specific problem, and they just close the report case if you try to inquire further. They have no phone number to call, and with the online support being so poor, you basically cannot reach out to them at all. I felt ignored, and definitely didn‚Äôt feel like this was worth spending my money on the Premium membership.

Title: Performance none existent
----------------------------------------------------------
What a let down. I did my research and received a Charge HR for xmas upon my request based upon lavish reviews read of care-free low maintenance experience by a professional reviewer and others. My experience is; unable to get app downloaded/working on my Dell PC with Windows 10, downloaded Fitbit app onto my iPhone 6s+ but it would not sync with it nor my fitness pal app completely (as advertised), the clock does not work, the Fitbit community is a time-consuming labybrinth absent of Fitbit experts to show the way but by others who don't know.  My Fitbit experience is that it is NOT plug-and-play easy peasy (as advertised), nor have the carefree $130 value to my health or well being. Give me my money back!

Title: Hate the update
----------------------------------------------------------
For someone that has used this app for over a year faithfully and some time before that. This is extremely disappointing to see this update. When I saw the merge with UA I knew this would eventually fail like its predecessor. I have recommended this app to over 20 fitness clients and many other students. I am a certified personal trainer, strength and conditioning ing specialist and soon to be licensed physical therapists, so the more difficult charts are certainly not a concern of mine, however, my clients may feel differently. I suggest you either allow users to revert back to an older version or you will just be added to another list of disappointments. Currently searching for a better fitness tracker

Title: MFP - what happened?
----------------------------------------------------------
last week the app was great.  it finds food fast, it saves recent entries. a joy to use. this week the ads are so intrusive, I am looking for another app.  i have been using mfp for quite a while and it has helped me lose weight and be more healthy. but now, it aint worth it.  i know its free, but i should not have to wait to track a food item while ads load.  plus the ads take up so much screen, and are so in the way, i click on them twice just trying to put in lunch!  also they (mfp and underarmour) send me unsolicited marketing without a way to opt out. and i feel 9.99 a month to stop ads is unreasonable.  I have sent emails to voice my opinion, but the answers are not comforting.  very dissapointed.

Title: Disappointed!!
----------------------------------------------------------
When the app actually works it‚Äôs great....... but I‚Äôm very strict about logging in.  I was up to 4,180 days logged in in a row..... they had a glitch with their server took me back to day 1.  Contacted the company through the email provided.... no one ever contacted me back.   I logged in again, got up to 235 days in a row....... they had another glitch in their server....... took me back to day 1, and this has happened two times since as well.  If they are going to be a weight loss app, they need to work correctly. For us to work so hard at losing weight and logging in every day..... it‚Äôs a slap in the face to take us back to day 1.......... especially 4 times, when it‚Äôs an error with their server!!!!!

Title: Awful update
----------------------------------------------------------
The new update removed almost ALL of the foods I eat every day in both my Frequent and Recent tabs. Even more annoying, foods I haven't eaten in MONTHS show up in my Frequent and Recent tabs. What happened??? I now have to scan in foods that I eat all the time. Btw, I paid $50/year for this app and I've used it consistently for over 4 years. Furthermore, I sent an email regarding this to the tech team more than a week ago and haven't heard back.  While I'm sure they're very busy, surely they can provide at least a form email in response. This is entirely unacceptable for such an expensive app. 1. TEST YOUR UPDATES! and 2. Provide customer service to your customers who pay $50 a year for a subscription.

Title: Beyond frustrated
----------------------------------------------------------
I have had My Fitness Pal for years and so has my sister.  We are both single and don‚Äôt like to cook a recipe and have to eat the same thing all week so we trade several of our portioned meals each week to switch things up.  Then we share the meal info from our diary so we can track the info. And the macros.  Now there is all the sudden no way to share anymore.  My sister has premium and I do not so if she sends me a screenshot of the macros I can‚Äôt do a quick add for macros - only for total calories..so I am now forced to either upgrade to premium or manually input every single recipe she sends me so I can track my macros.  I feel like I just got tricked into having to pay the upgrade money. Not cool.

Title: Update broke some things
----------------------------------------------------------
Been using this for years and like it, but updates recently are making it worse instead of better.  For example, the latest update made changing serving number super annoying since it puts the cursor to the left of the number so you can‚Äôt backspace and edit.  PLEASE FIX THIS.  It‚Äôs one of the most common tasks and it‚Äôs a major usability problem now. Also - they changed the color representing protein to purple in the 7-day bar chart, but kept protein green in the daily view pie chart... little stuff like this make me wonder if the development team has had some turnover, because these are silly oversights that shouldn‚Äôt make it to public versions and didn‚Äôt seem to be such a frequent problem in the past.

Title: Good application, user friendly but it contains public postings and editings ...
----------------------------------------------------------
Although the my fitness pal application is user friendly and easily accessible for everyone the information that is utilized and posted are those of general "Guessing" and are not posted by only a nutrition professional. It is a great place to take place for food records. However, the fat, protein and carb content of many dishes and foods are completely incorrect and ridiculous. Foods that are bad are deemed "3130 Calories" with 450 grams of carbohydrate. This amount of carbohydrate is equal to 5 cups of granulated sugar or 4 cups of steel cut oatmeal. A total disgrace to a user friendly application. The consideration of a dietitian or nutritionist to review information full time would be recommended.
