Title: LOVE LOVE LOVE
----------------------------------------------------------
Okay so I recently got engaged and like most people in a happy relationship I put on some happy weight after being together for 3 years. LOL. I knew that I wanted to lose about 20 pounds before our wedding but I  was CLUELESS on where to begin. I’ve never had a problem with my weight because I’ve always stayed so active, but in the past year I’ve been in nursing school and if you’ve been there, you feel my pain. Finding time to exercise, eat right, study, go to class, clinicals, etc. is TOUGH. So I heard all about the keto diet and figured I’d give it a try. Once again keep in mind I’m clueless about the whole process and I’m the type of person that doesn’t trust just ANY article/post I come across. So I did some research and came across the Carb Manager app and YALL..... it was a game changer. If you’re a beginner like me and don’t know what in the world you’re doing, THIS IS THE APP FOR YOU. Granted, to get the best results from it I do recommend paying for the subscription but it’s WELL worth it. This app literally gives you a TON of recipes, let’s you log which one you’re going to eat that day and makes a dang SHOPPING LIST for you! Does it get much better than that y’all? I think not. There is also a place where you can log your exercise and apply it to your daily intake and you can also keep track of how much water you drink. Mind blown. ALSO you can upload recipes you find on Pinterest etc. to make sure they’re legit (big plus for me because like I said I’m a skeptic about most things LOL) it literally breaks it down into a pie chart for you — and if you’re like me and have an occasional sweet tooth, fret not, because guess what? There’s plenty of dessert recipes too! It gives you all kinds of information about the diet and explains everything to a T. So yeah thanks for coming to my TED talk y’all. LOL...... But seriously though download the app. (:

Title: I SOOO LOVE THIS APP❤️❤️
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m so impressed with how user friendly this app is. I started the keto diet in November 2019 and I’ve lost 30 pounds. I started doing this by myself but when my husband would taste my food he wanted it instead of what I made for him. Needless to say, now we’re both doing it! He didn’t need to lose weight but he wanted to do it because it’s a much healthier way of eating and he wanted to support my journey with keto along the way.  At a Christmas party we have with our friends every year all my friends started asking me what I was doing. I asked what they meant because they know I can’t exercise due to a lot of bone, joint, and spinal health issues. They asked what I was doing to lose weight and what I was doing to my skin. I told them I was on the keto diet and what apps I use to help manage and keep me motivated. They were in awe. I had asked my best friend, who was hosting the party, a few days before the party to set a piece of beef roast aside for me before she added anything so I wouldn’t break my diet and that really peaked her interest. Since that night she has asked me a lot of questions about the diet so I’ve referred this app to her. Since I’m at home all day every day I know that it’s much easier for me to stay true to the diet than for those who work out of the home but trust me, it’s still very doable!  I love Lifesum!! I had the app an entire year before I ever used it. I guess I was ready mentally, but after 2 weeks my energy was higher than it had been in years, I lost weight and my skin is glowing! My hair stopped falling out and my nails stopped breaking as much!  If you’re thinking about doing keto I do HIGHLY recommend Lifesum!! You won’t be disappointed!!

Title: Carb Manager compared to MyFitnessPal and Cronometer
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used MyFitnessPal (premium version )For about four years. It is very easy to use and provides just about any information I could’ve ever wanted. My biggest complaint was inaccurate nutritional information on several occasions, but still they are pretty good. What really annoyed me recently was trying to find nutritional info for a common food. For some reason many of the foods in the category I was looking at were printed out in a foreign language (other than English). I had never had that problem before. I told look at Carb Manager and absolutely fell in love with it, having bought the premium version. I am prediabetic and over age 65. Carb manager very well fills my expectations for all types of information that anyone on a keto diet would like to know. Although MyFitnessPal Provided similar information, it wasn’t as focused on keto as carb manager is. I also bought the premium version of Cronometer. Chronometer reviews indicated they were the most accurate of all the nutrition apps, and what little experience I’ve had with it so far I find that to be true. However, extremely high accuracy for nutritional information Hass to be weighed against the quantitative inputs one makes - which is often an estimate. So the overall accuracy of nutritional information for me, was not enough to sell me. Chronometer also had no easy way to input water consumption. Bottom line is that carb manager for me, has the best combination of nutritional information, ease of input and some extremely well laid out navigation within the app.

Title: An amazing tool
----------------------------------------------------------
I have had a great experience using this app. It’s easy to use, and is on my cell phone — so, I can update or edit my food intake and track my protein, carb, fat, and calorie intake through out the day. It has been easy to find and match the foods that I eat which makes it easy to be accurate and personalized about my exact food intake. It’s also very user friendly vehicle so it allows me to easily see if a particular food that I may be consider for consumption will fit into the limits/goals — that I’ve intentionally chosen for myself since it has a display panel that shows the maximum amount of calories, proteins, carbs, and fats that I’ve decided to consume daily. I am currently using this as a weight loss tool because, I unfortunately had put on 30lbs during the current Covid worldwide pandemic. I’m excited to say that I’ve already lost 7lbs is just 10 days. I have lost this weight without starving myself at all. I can also track my activities, exercising, and water intake too. I can’t wait to continue — and I plan to loose all my covid weight gain. I plan to use this app even after I reach my goal weight — because, my body thrives on a moderate calorie, low carb, high protein diet that incorporates good fats. I love how the program has notations about keto friendly foods. I also hope to eventually use the many great recipes that are linked to this site. Hip hip hooray to the help that this app offers with regard to healthy eating. Thank you!

Title: Not perfect, but the best I’ve found
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded four carb/blood sugar tracking apps to see which might help me log in my foods and track macros (protein, fat, carbs) + net carbs, fiber, blood sugar.  Carb Manager really stood out.  “My Fitness Pal,” which a lot of low-carbers use, had a very limited food database, and doesn’t track fiber/net carbs.  “Stupid Simple” had cute icons, but almost no database.  I don’t recall the fourth, except that the interface was not a good fit.  Carb Manager has an extensive food database.  The only thing I haven’t found in it so far is orange extract.  It lets me save custom foods (like bulletproof coffee) and even recipes—so I can see how many net carbs are in one of the almond flour cookies my daughter has been experimenting with.  Since I liked the food tracking so much, I sprung for the one-year membership ($39.99) so I could add blood sugar and sleep tracking, and food minerals, as well.  It displays data in useful ways—bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts—and ties it together.  It’s not always the most intuitive to use:  I keep losing the sleep entry field (under “Lifestyle”) vs. blood sugar (“My Measurements”—aren’t I measuring sleep?).  And, if my macros look off, 8 have to double check that the right portion size of a food or ingredient registered.  But, it’s easy to edit, and in a week I’ve already brought my fasting blood sugar down 12 points and lost a pound!  Carb Manager is the tool I need to stay on track with my blood sugar health.

Title: Where is support?
----------------------------------------------------------
I looked for a way to ask support in the app but couldn’t find a place to do so. I’ve been a member for quite a while now. It’s by far the best carb tracking app that I’ve found and I’ve tried 5 or 6 of them. I keep coming back here. I pay for premium even. However I’m really frustrated. I’m having a hard time entering recipes. After I get all the info typed in there is many times no “save” option. I have to click the upper right corner to get out of the screen and so lose everything I’m trying to save. I try to refresh the screen, I poke around at the top of the screen (where it’s just white space), I clear out the food search history - nothing.  It’s hard enough for me to be faithful in tracking and with things like this happening quite often I’d rather just quit. This needs to be fixed. I’ve invested enough time and money with this app that I don’t want to throw in the towel, but this is annoying!!  The other annoyance is if I make a typo I can’t correct it or add a word in the middle of a line without completely starting over. The cursor automatically takes me to the end of the sentence. E.g if I want “ground cinnamon” and I forget to type ground or if I type grnd I can’t just jump in to correct it, I have to erase the entire line and start over. SO annoying. Each extra keystroke takes time that I don’t want to devote to tracking. I need it to be easy!  I love the scan feature. I wish all ingredients could be scanned.

Title: Love Carb Manager
----------------------------------------------------------
I think this app is fabulous!  It's everything I wanted. Had to contact Customer Service because I was having trouble signing in but they got back to me in less than 24 hours with a resolution. I purchased the premium app and I'm glad I did. I used the non-premium for awhile but wanted the extras in premium.  There are a couple things I noticed that I hope they "catch up" on. As mentioned by another reviewer the search feature does not present an alphabetized list and sometimes I have to switch around word order to find. However, once you put foods in your favorites they are alphabetized. In addition, the water feature is only in 8 oz increments. As I often drink 1/2 cups or 12 oz they should really change this to an ounce feature, or at least tap twice on the glass. Once for 4 oz twice for 8 oz. minor details. PC sync is also very nice. I really like the analyze feature and supplements categories although my supplements don't come up in bar scan and I had to put them in as custom foods. Bar scan is great feature. It's found things I could not find on the search feature right away. Search feature also has numerous quantity selections to choose from so however I measure foods or decide on portions I've never had trouble finding (although sometimes I need to squint to see what the portion size says if it's a really long description).

Title: Fantastic!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have lost 122 lbs with about 65 lbs to go now. I've used Richard Simmons, weight watchers, overeaters anonymous, Jenny Craig,and hypnosis.  Three years ago I was diagnosed with type two diabetes as so many of us Americans now are. I have successfully counted weight watchers points and calories but the ketogenic diet seems to truly be a key piece to my weight-loss puzzle/diabetic management. Both my doctor who is a diabetic specialist and my nutritionist have confirmed that a ketogenic diet is extremely beneficial for type two diabetic patients. But the reality of daily life makes logging grams of carbohydrates a real barrier to staying accountable. Carb Manager is a fantastic app that makes accurately tracking carbohydrate intake as painless and convenient as is probably possible to achieve. I especially like the barcode reader which allows me to get the exact product carbohydrates. I've been using CM now for about two months with great success. Like all of these things YOU have to make time to do it every day. But really it just takes a couple of minutes to log your food. Tracking weight and body size is also super convenient. It's just a great health and nutrition management app. I highly recommend it!

Title: Easy Breezy App
----------------------------------------------------------
Carb manager has made it so easy to calculate my macros for keto meals and edit all through the day, even has the option to take some of the prepared recipes and change an ingredient that recalculates the macros for you. This app has so many good tasting and variety of recipes that makes meal planning so easy. As long as I have the keto staples, I’m able to change to another recipe at the last minute to something else that I’m craving without falling behind on meeting my daily macro goals. I’m so glad I subscribed to the premium membership. Best part I was offered a discounted cost and glad I accepted the opportunity given to me. It’s all worth it. I don’t think I can do without carb manager now. I’m addicted to this app. So easy to count macros and look up my next delicious meal to prepare right there at my fingertips on my cell phone. Where ever I am I have easy access to view, add, subtract macros and ensure I have what I need to prepare a new recipe in case I need to make a grocery run while I’m out. You’ve made my life and meal planning to reach my weight loss goal too easy. Thank you Carb manager and I Love this app!

Title: Awesome App
----------------------------------------------------------
Really like this app. It was everything for nutrition that my FitBit app is not. Love the breakdown in carbs, fiber, protein, fat, and macro nutrients. A friend of mine introduced me to carb manager, and even in the short time I have been using it, I have already begun cutting pounds. I exercise a lot, and have had trouble cutting the fat. Diet and rest are the keys to success, and this app has given me the tools to succeed. Barcode scanner works really well. You can create custom foods to enter in supplements. Lots of charts and info. My only drawback is that there is not seamless integration with Fitbit. You have to download another app to export data from Fitbit to Apple Health in order to get your data, but even then, Fitbit is holding up key elements from heart rate and active calories. This is on Fitbit though. They need to play nice. I like my Fitbit, but this makes me want to move over to an apple watch. My wife has one, and there is seamless integration across all apps. Carb Manager is fantastic. Have been pushing it on all my friends. Not just a carb manager. Manage it all.

Title: Making goals Achievable
----------------------------------------------------------
I am so excited about this app!!  First all it is so easy to use!  The scan feature allows me to quickly add foods using the barcode on the product; then it calculates based on portion size you choose so you know EXACTLY what you’re putting in your body!  There is also an incredibly extensive quick search that has EVERYTHING you could eat in it!  The goals feature allows you to set your daily goals, then helps you track how the goods you eat add up to your goal totals.  I started this diet plan one week ago; I’ve been measuring my ketones daily and achieved mild ketosis on day three, and full ketosis on day six!!  I keep to a 20 gm carb restriction, and 1500 calories.  I have to say I feel GREAT!  I didn’t get anywhere near my 1500 calories today, and I don’t feel hungry!!  I have great energy, I sleep great and wake up ready to tackle my day!  Toss us the best I’ve felt in YEARS!!  I’m 39, with two kids, and excited that THIS IS WORKING! Carb Manager is definitely the key to my successful first week, and will continue to be my best Keto coach!!  Thanks got such a great app!!

Title: Perfect for getting started
----------------------------------------------------------
I am trying the Keto diet and did not know where or how to get started with all the rules, seems everything has carbs in it...I downloaded the free app and it’s great! It helped me purge what I had in the house, took a bit of entering all the items in the app, but the effort was worth it. Not only did it tell me what was in the food, but more importantly to me, made me conscious of what I HAVE been eating and what goes in my body now is in the front of my mind. Especially that I’m not getting younger... I’ve used this app for just over a week now, and have already lost 5 lbs, have not touched a weight, walk, treadmill, any sort of cardio, and I feel great! (A little help from a friend, take a couple of shots of pickle juice each day the first week, sounds weird, and bathroom visits, but it works and is worth it!!!) I’m not at the point where I want to pay for the extra, but the basic free app is well worth it to be more conscious of what to eat and what not to eat. Recommend it if your not very ‘food savvy’ of what macros are in the food you eat.

Title: Carb Manager
----------------------------------------------------------
I love carb manager, it is great and very easy to follow, it allows for a variety of low carb foods. This is the best thing going. And I love the recipes that are available. So far, I have made the Turkey Chili which was just wonder, I also made the Turkey Loaf, the chia pudding. If you are serious about losing weight, carb manager will get you there. I have lost 25 pounds since May of this year. You have to put some effort in and exercise which I consider now  a plus benefit. This time last year I had so much arthritic pain that I  could barely walk. I am walking now independently (no more cane), no more gout pain and no more arthritic pain. I attributed most of that arthritic pain to the high sugar intake (candy, cookies, doughnuts). My feet and ankles were always swollen due the high intake of salty snacks. My BP is down. My doctor has taken me off Lasix and several other pills. Now I am down to 1/2 tab of BP meds and 1 cholesterol tab. I feel great physically and emotionally. Now I look forward to preparing my meals and exercising daily.

Title: Love the Carb Manager Keto Diet app
----------------------------------------------------------
Love this app!!! I am able to manage my Carb intake. It allows one to track net carbs, total carbs, fiber, fat, protein and calories, by inputting to my daily log. Your Able  to create your favorite recipes, scan in your favorite Keto food. One of my favorite things on this app is the Keto Grade. This allows you to see if your choice of food is allowed on KetoDiet. Gives you a grade, for example, if you input something that is not Keto friendly, it will give you a grade F (avoid). For us newbies on Keto this is a great tool to have on an app. Also able to track water intake, as well as your Exercise, cardio, weights. Also tracks ones weight and body measurements. This app is everything you need to be successful On the KetoDiet. Great app for free. Now they do have Premium version. It cost, I would purchase the Premium, but, my budget does not allow it right now. The Premium gives you access to many recipes, meal planner, shopping list, you are able to connect with your fitness device. Connects to Fitbit, Garmin,  Apple Health, Apple Watch.

Title: Best app to manage daily carb intake
----------------------------------------------------------
I credit this app for assisting me in losing over 30 lbs and cutting my body fat from 34% to 21% after using for 10 months. Of course I also worked out but previously had little progress in dropping weight. Once I used this app to manage my daily carb and calories intake I started dropping weight. I feel energized and my appetite has greatly decreased as a result of stabilizing my insulin levels due to proper carb management. I don't eliminate carbs just minimize. Also allows me to still eat things I have a hankering for throughout the day but in smaller portions or choosing alternatives that are lower in carbs. Helps me to be flexible with a dynamic diet as opposed to a static diet. I'm 49 years old and was amazed that my metabolism can almost function at a 20 yr old level when properly managing carb intake. Can't live without this app. I'm still making progress and now have a target of 15% body fat. I'm leaner and have decent muscle definition as a result. Everyone thinks I'm in my mid 30's. Not bad for a soon to be a 50 year old man.

Title: Best Food Tracker in the App Store
----------------------------------------------------------
Finally an app that has an easy interface, accurate food lists and a database of everything I eat.  The Scanner, unlike other apps hasn't missed a single item I have tried which ensures everything I want to track is counted precisely.   Getting into a Keto Diet can be a little confusing to figure out the percentages of foods, but no more. With Carb Manager, you have a simple to read Pie chart or circle graph with your daily values just to the right.   If you eat similar foods everyday there are multiple ways for you to bring them over to the current day.  I use the copy to command all the time.  It works for single items or entire meals.   The free version does everything I need, but because it works so well, I am going to buy the premium service so I can integrate it with my exercise goals and take advantage of the devices, get recipe ideas, meal planners and shopping lists.  One last note. This app syncs with a web page so you can also use your computer to do the same stuff as your smart phone.  5 stars.   My health thanks you!!

Title: Hooray for Carb Manager!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m a 60-year-old male, recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes with high blood pressure and sleep apnea. I’ve been obese for more than 25 years. I’m now under the care of a weight loss doctor who mandated that I use the Carb Manager app. I was apprehensive about logging my meals and snacks at first, but I actually enjoy planning and tracking what I eat. And I’m losing weight. 2 years ago I weighed 300 pounds. I managed to lose about 30 pounds and lower my A1-c score from 6.4 to 5.9, but gained 10 pounds during the COVID-19 shutdown and my A1-C spiked to 6.5. Working with my new doctor and using Carb Manager, I’m confident I will stay on track and meet my weight loss goal, lower my blood pressure and mitigate my sleep apnea over time. I weighed 261 pounds today and have lost about 15 pounds in 6 weeks. I love this app and I look forward to recording my meals/foods/drinks for the first time in my life. My goal weight is 175 pounds but I will be happy with 190. I’m 5’11” tall with a large frame. Thanks Carb Manager!

Title: Loving this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
Decided to go back on low carb after a few years off and now retired found myself slowly accumulating the pounds. Looked at a few apps that would help me get back into the swing of things easily. This app has it all! So easy to enter foods by text or bar code scanning. Haven't tried the speech recognition yet. The photo option identified almost everything on my plate (chicken leg, cole slaw and grape tomatoes). And they even have most restaurants included. They have delicious recipes and can even customize a meal plan in a few clicks! You can tell it to eliminate certain foods that you may be sensitive to or just don't like. It has gluten free and fodmap free versions! Love that all my Fit-Bit steps and exercises are linked. I used the free version for a few days(while I was prepping for success before I started my new low carb lifestyle) and decided to invest in the paid version because it has so much to offer. Anything is worth it if it makes life easier and helps guarantee success!

Title: Very precise, easy to use!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried a lot of different health apps. This is by are the best. I don’t usually care enough about something to leave a review, good or bad. But this app does everything I need it to. I have to be extremely careful with my carbs for blood sugar’s sake. It is so nice to be able to see my day at a glance, and note my trends over time. You can do this with almost any app, but the difference here is the EASE. It is so easy to use! I love being able to copy my meals to different days. It does all of the nice things my fitness pal does, I.e. save frequent meals and recipes, give you your macro breakdown, set goals, PLUS it has education, it has meal ideas, and you can log blood sugar and other similar things (like keto readings). Other fitness apps takes ages to log meals, are glitchy. And the layout of things is confusing or at least usually is to me. This is the most user friendly app I’ve come across. Of all the ones I’ve tried, this one is the best!

Title: I’m finally really doing keto
----------------------------------------------------------
I am thrilled with this app.  I have tried keto on my own and have never succeeded. I would cut out what I thought I was supposed to be cutting out and I would not feel any better and I would not lose any weight. I have been using Carb Manager for about two weeks now and I know I’ve already lost 10 pounds. I started out at 234 lbs. I think I’ve lost more but it’s not time for me to weigh yet. I have no complaints about this app. It took a little bit to learn all the different things about the app but I have been able to figure it all out without any help.    I finally understand the whole macro thing! This is what has been missing. I still had a mindset about fat.  I’m 55 years old so I’ve had a lot of years of hearing that fat is bad fat is bad.  I am doing great and I’m having plenty of food to eat and I’m never starving in fact I don’t even feel hungry I just get shaky.  Thank you so very much for this app. It is changing my life!

Title: Only app I use
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been using this app for 2 years now. It’s one of the few that I purchased a premium membership. It’s worth it and to get the most out of the app and your goals, I highly recommend purchasing vs the free usage where you are limited. The intuitiveness and features of what I can do has surpassed a lot of other apps I’ve tried to use. I can track what I need to track based on my individual goals (macros), track exercise (just recently connected to my Apple Watch, so hopeful of that), look up recipes with instructions, log food with an extensive database to choose from (have yet to find something not already in the database!), etc. This app has instructions on how to perform exercises you may not be familiar with, videos on how to prepare a recipe, etc. This app does it all and the developers took everything into account. Definitely recommend! This is also the first review I’ve done on an app...it’s just that good.

Title: Perfect App
----------------------------------------------------------
I was hesitant about paying for the premium features but it went on sale and I went ahead and pulled the trigger, so glad I did. I was a long time My Fitness Pal user but then I started Keto and I was frustrated that it wouldn’t do Net Carbs, it just wasn’t in my opinion really the best app for Keto so I wanted another solution. Carb Manager is Taylor design for this diet and makes it so easy. I am so impressed with all the thought that has been put into this app. Every time I think I wish I could do something I find that the developers have incorporated it into the app. It is so user friendly to use, I love the interface. I absolutely love the meal planning features, such a time saver!!! Speaking of meal planning the recipe selection is off the chain. Bottom line if your doing Keto and you want a tool to make it easy for you to track and plan in my honest opinion you can do no better than Carb Manager!

Title: Great for Keto
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been using this app for almost a year now and I love it. If you can do the premium version, it’s well worth it. Makes meal planning and finding new keto-friendly foods and meals super easy. I find it easier to hold myself accountable if I have visuals and I love the circle graph on this platform. Makes it easy to keep yourself in check. I went for part of the year with the free version, which is awesome on its own, but I prefer the paid version. It helps me track  all of my body measurements and food all in one convenient place and it syncs with apple health. Even if you’re not doing keto, this is a great app. I’ve used so many food trackers in the past (my fitness pal, weight watchers, lose it, etc) and this by far my favorite!!! Before paying for the premium service again, I tried out all of those apps again and even their premium versions don’t offer what this app has. Definitely worth it!!!

Title: App does literally everything
----------------------------------------------------------
As an absolute NEW COMER to anything diet related .. I found this app literally guiding my decisions. Before I shove anything (food) in my mouth - I punch said food in the app- and find out how many carbs/ fat/ protein etc. I lost 30 lbs - literally by doing this. Could not be simpler. Do a little research - Decide what macros you want to use- For is we went Keto- which is a percentage of net carbs/ protein / fat- pick your macros from drop down menu- enter your weight - Click enter and you’re off and running. Input what you eat- and this app does the math and tells how many Net Carbs remaining for the day-  Calories, protein , fat etc. stick to that and you will lose weight. It’s that simple. You can track your steps, exercise , and weight. Can’t think of a healthy yet delicious meal? It’s got that too. Try it out- If I can lose 30 lbs with no additional work out besides working - You can too.

Title: Latest Update is Great!
----------------------------------------------------------
The updated Carb Manager App has added more features that make it even more user friendly. I like the new recipe database, it allows you to search over 360,000 recipes while using the app. If you feel stuck in your meal options, simply search for new ones and the app will save them for you and figures the carbs, calories, etc. This is a great option! There are also more analysis reports available with a breakdown of the vitamins and nutrients you are or are not getting from the foods you eat, which I find helpful. As well as water intake and exercise, the amount of sleep you get a night is also featured on the app. I like this addition and think it helps with my overall health. The Carb Manager app is a great tool for a busy lifestyle, not only for low carb eating but for charting one's health. I highly recommend this app to anyone wanting to be more aware of what they are eating.

Title: Nice app, one flaw?
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like the format of this app and it has really helped me to start making sense of macros while on Keto diet. Before this app, I had no idea what percent of my diet was fat or protein. There is just one flaw that I question, and maybe I have not found a setting that exists to fix it, or maybe it’s a premium feature. My carb count always shows way over my limit and it’s because the app is not deducting fiber from my carbs. I eat one Mission Carb Balance wrap per day because it gives me 15g of fiber and only 3 net carbs (the spinach variety), but the app recognizes this as a full 18g carb, so I am always in the red, over my limit of staying under 20g (net carb) per day. If not for this the app would be perfect, well done! I appreciate using it. Despite this I highly recommend this app, you just need to deduct your fiber from your total carbs yourself and ignore the red.

Title: The best app I’ve ever used!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app. I started keto a few months ago and didn’t know how to keep track of everything I was eating and how much I was consuming but thanks to this app that is no longer a concern for me. It is very customizable and easy to use. It breaks down all your macronutrients so you can understand how much you are really consuming and what your putting into your body. It also allows for you to input your own recipes and then it breaks it down into carbs, fats, protein, sugar and calorie amount so you can better portion it all out. This app made keto possible for me. Without it I would be completely lost. I am considering going premium even though the free version is more than adequate. That’s how much I love this app! Download it and put it to use, let it help you reach your goals. A some job to the developers of this app, you’re changing lives!

Title: Works
----------------------------------------------------------
It helped me loose 50 lbs in a year.  Took a month off, working on my next fifty now.  It is critical that you log everything BEFORE you eat it!   I tried the free version for about three days then paid for a year, it was totally worth it for the recipes, and to have it pull in data from my second Fitbit.    My lessons:   I do much better when I log water, don’t ignore that.   Short morning walk make a huge difference.  I drink an Ultima every day, use more salt, and added a cheap multivitamin, C, and D for days I don’t get good balance.  I know I would’ve gotten better results if I do exercise more but I’m just lazy. I have a cheat day once a month where I eat everything I want and a cheat meal once a week where I don’t get too crazy.  I did it with my wife and we joined a couple keto groups on Facebook for more crazy recipes. Good luck!

Title: This app changed my life
----------------------------------------------------------
I use very few apps. I don’t write reviews. But since this app has helped me so much, I must give credit where credit is due. ‘Getting Started’ allowed me to set up daily goals within a ketogenic program. The Keto diet often feels confusing and counter-intuitive but this app guides you through it, every day. It has been fascinating to learn all the time, about the true carb content of various foods. The Find Food section is just incredible. It has actually been FUN, dieting and using this app. I’ve been using the app for about 6 weeks now, and it is absolutely responsible for allowing me to lose 15 pounds. I did not think it was possible - I’m over 60 and injured so exercise these past months has not been possible. Seriously, if you allow this app to guide you and you are committed, you WILL lose weight. I just can’t recommend it enough.

Title: Can't live without this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used this app daily for over 4 months and have never experienced any issues (until the most recent update-but those were taken care of super fast with the awesome support of this team!). This app is easy, intuitive, and quick. I am just getting used to the new format since the most recent update so I haven't decided which I like better (old or new) but I do like some of the added features (adding a note, being able to add to a previous day something you may have forgotten or in my case, fell asleep before it was added) so I'm thinking this new layout will be awesome once I get used to it. I can't say enough how appreciative I am of the quick response I got from the support team as I literally can't go without this app since I started my ketogenic diet 4 months ago. I know there are other apps out there but this one's the best!

Title: Best for Keto
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded a few apps when I started Keto to see what the best one would be. I had been using MFP for years but if you’re doing Keto this is a much better option so you can see your macros right in your home page. My only complaint is that the food database is not as complete as MFP, and I have encountered a few errors on some food entries. These are things that hopefully will improve with time. You just have to double check a few things to make sure your numbers don’t get thrown off. I would also like it if there was an easier way to add friends that you know have the app. And I’d like to be able to share recipes that I’ve entered so that friends who are eatting the meal I’ve made can easily add an entry without typing the whole recipe in themselves. But for a free version this really is the best app I’ve found for Keto.

Title: I love this app
----------------------------------------------------------
First and foremost, this app does have a pay option. You can upgrade to get access to more things, like premium recipes. I’m poor and cheap 😂 so I use the free option in this app and I really like it a lot. The options that I have are good enough for me. I love that I can set my specific diet plan such as “Keto”, “low fat”, “build muscle”, and this app will help guide me into that path. I had NO IDEA I was eating so many carbs! My mind is blown but I’m excited to continue on my weight loss journey. Oh, and one more AMAZING aspect of the free option, you can simply scan the barcode of a package of food, instead of typing in the brand name and style and amount. It’s super handy. Please, please, please keep the free portion free. It’s a God send for people like me who are practically breaking the bank purchasing healthy foods.

Title: Best dieting app ever
----------------------------------------------------------
I hate dieting. This is the first time I’ve ever done it in my life. But I like the keto diet: it’s scientifically sound and helps me cut out just the bad stuff. This app is the perfect companion. It’s extremely well-designed and targeted for low-carb and keto diets, makes it easy for me to track what I’m eating, and never makes me feel bad FOR eating! I was really nervous when I searched for a diet app because I didn’t want to make dieting any worse for me, but this app is helping and not hurting. Especially with keeping track of the “invisible” carbs that fall through the cracks. The developer clearly put a lot of time and effort into this app. Little things like the built-in water counter - something it’s very important to make sure you have enough of in the early stages - really make it obvious. Bravo and thank you.

Title: Really helps control the carbs!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was struggling with weight loss even though my husband had provided me with a one month Keto diet plan designed to specifically fit me.  I was following the directions for the meal plan just as it was provided to me and I was losing very slowly bouncing up and down, a pound down then up, a little here, a little there.  My son, who had been on the Keto Diet for over a year told me about the Carb Manager program he had loaded on his his phone and how much it had helped him.  So, I downloaded Carb Manager and I could actually see what I was eating on the diet plan my husband had ordered for me.  I began to make adjustments, cutting out things here and there, like onions, I never knew they had so many carbs.  I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate this program and how much it has been helping me.  Thank you.

Title: Fantastic, helpful app!
----------------------------------------------------------
Everyone I know who has been uber-successful in losing weight writes down their food intake each day. That just wasn’t me. But this app changed everything for me. It makes it so easy to log exactly what you ate in the exact portion and gives you the exact nutritional count with graphs so can visually see everything in multiple ways. I can’t say enough about Carb Manager. I look forward to laying in bed each night and logging everything because it does all the difficult calculating for me. But it doesn’t stop there. Add your exercises, water, ketones, blood sugar, weight, on and on. I knew within just a few days using it that this was going to help my carb and weight journey so I paid for the upgrade. Well worth it. I only write reviews when something is very bad or very good. This app is beyond very good.

Title: Love it but...I have one issue
----------------------------------------------------------
Just started using this app yesterday and it’s incredibly easy to use. You literally can just jump right in and start logging after filling out a few things. My only issue is that yesterday, which was my first day using the app, it would not allow me to finish logging my dinner. I had one more item to add for the day. Every single time I tried to log my grilled vegetables, the app would prompt me to upgrade to premium. There was no way around it other than to not log the veggies. Today the app Is allowing me to log as I start a new day. No where in the information do I see a maximum amount of items that you are allowed to log before having to upgrade. While I do not mind paying for an app like this, I always like to try them for at least a month to make sure I really like it. Open to suggestions...

Title: I love Carb Manager
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using Carb Manager the day after Labor Day. My weight was 229 and I didn’t feel good. I started the Keto diet and needed a way to track my macros. It is now November 20th and I weigh below 200 pounds for the first time since 2013. Carb Manager is easy to use but you absolutely need to be honest and put everything in that you eat or you will fail. The circle helps you see your progress. It shows all of your recent foods so they are easy to add when you eat them again. I would not have done this without this app. It has made it so much easier. I am a Keto lifestyle person now and plan to keep using the app. If I don’t, I will start eating hidden carbs. That sets you up for failure. It takes just a few seconds to enter what you eat, or plan to eat and that is important. I love Carb Manager.

Title: GREAT recipe features!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used MyFitnessPal exclusively for almost 8 years. It did the job, but my boyfriend switched to this app when we went keto and I was right behind him. I absolutely LOVE this app.  My main gripe about MFP has always been that you couldn’t account for net carbs in your macros. That was what first attracted me to Carb Manager, but I have really enjoyed using the recipe features, and the scan feature is INCREDIBLY convenient. I can create a recipe for meal prep for the week, portion it out, and send it to my boyfriend for his macro tracking too. The food library isn’t as expansive as MFP of course, but adding macros or meals is super easy. This app is genius. My only request would be that you’re able to account for pounds in decimals instead of just whole numbers. Other than that, fantastic!

Title: App is great but doesn’t sync well with Fitbit. Support doesn’t respond.
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought paid for a year membership to have Fitbit sync my steps. It synced for a day but then stopped, so I had to keep turning it on and off in settings to be able to start syncing again. A couple days ago it stopped syncing at all and said I had to turn Fitbit on through the carb manager website via desktop. I thought this was finally a fix - I went ahead and synced from their website and now it doesn’t work at all.  I followed all the steps to sync my Fitbit to the carb manager app. my Fitbit website is perfectly synced with the Fitbit app but the CarbManager app or website doesn’t sync at all. Very frustrating... if they fix the syncing my rating goes back to 5 stars but it’s 3 for now as it’s not delivering as promised right now. Disappointed I paid for a feature that doesn’t work.

Developer Response:

Title: Best App Ever!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am a journalist who struggles with my weight.  Last year my nutritionist got me in the mindset of counting carbs but I needed help!  Every app I’ve researched and/or discovered were disappointing most because of ads and in-app purchases.  Then on Sunday, April 29th, I knew I had to find something because my eating was spiraling out of control and with every pound gain was a step towards death.  I found Carb Manager!! Finally an app that meet my needs.  I enjoy that I can get everything I need from carb and calorie counting to scanning foods as well as a food search to include a database.  Yes one can upgrade to premium but if you’re looking for an app that does the basics all for you Carb Manager is your tool on the journey to a healthier lifestyle.  Thanks for reading.. 😀

Title: Best app ever for managing your diet!
----------------------------------------------------------
I gotta say I’ve looked at many apps and this is the easiest, most user friendly app I have ever used. I began with their Recipe Builder app and didn’t think you could improve on anything until their customer service told me about their newest app...and OMG, I’m in love with this app. I don’t want to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to record different serving sizes. This app has all that taken care of so it takes the guesswork out of it. I haven’t run into to any bugs with. Runs perfectly for me. The only two things I need are to be able to see the remaining calories for the day on the app badge and I’d like to be able to import my recipes from the old app. Even so, I can live without that since this app is so darn easy and has so much to offer.

Title: Fantastic, better than $50 programs
----------------------------------------------------------
Just what the paleo doctor ordered. A very similar program paleo tracker goes for $1 per week. Can't beat carb tracker. However, the graphs don't have a vertical axis. You can certainly see the trends, but have to touch each data point to see what it is. Also regarding tracking your weight, there's no way to set the date range, so when you look at the graph it goes from the beginning and you have to scroll for years just to see how you did over the last month. Nevertheless, this is the best carb or paleo tracker out there. I wish there was a way to get averages over a user-defined period (like the past month). Your only choice is to look at a graph and guess.  I wish you could edit dates weights were taken. I made a mistake and there is no way to change date

Title: HOLDS YOU ACCOUNTABLE
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this App.  I never read nutritional values as I didn’t have the time to count it all up and actually journal.  This App does it all for you the only thing you have to make sure is to journal and it makes you decide if it’s worth it to you to eat.  I’ve lost weight and still enjoy going out to eat.  I figure out by putting what I’m going to eat from whatever restaurant in my journal first.  All the calculations are done for you with this App so if it’s over your allowed intake you start changing things around.  I start by removing the carbs like bread and croutons so I can still enjoy my food.  I only bought the month membership after trying the free to see how much I would use it.  I will be purchasing the year subscription as soon as my month is up.

Title: Amazing Tracking App!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is by far the BEST food tracking app I have ever used.  If you follow the Keto way of life like I do, this is awesome.  Over the years I’ve used MANY weight loss apps.  Some from BIG corporations with their own programs to ones that were just an app company.  This app is so well created, developed, user friendly, and robust that I have ever used.  You know when you use an app and you think’ “I wish it did...”? Well, every time I think that with this app...IT DOES IT!!! I actually found this app because of a recipe search I did which led me to buy it for the recipe.  Even the recipes are amazing!!! They are simple, perfect for Keto, and just “normal” foods that most of us I already.  This app really helped me to kick off my Keto journey!!! Thank you!!!

Title: Great freebie tracker!
----------------------------------------------------------
Great app! You don’t have to pay for the premium account to get great use of this app. I was creating my own spreadsheet to count macros in different foods before I found this database and I’m pleased to save my time. The pie chart display makes it extremely easy to see if I’m short on any of my macros. You can save your own recipes to block in vs listing out individual ingredients over and over and over. Some common keto recipes (Egg Roll In a Bowl) are public access. New recipes are accessible for an additional monthly cost, but feels like an unnecessary luxury. Great app! Would love it if they’d go the distance of listing ingredients in different brands to help with planning the best meals. Developers— I might be willing to upgrade for that feature!

Title: Great AP and almost forgot it was an AP
----------------------------------------------------------
Reason why, this is a community. Somehow “they” (AP makers plus community doing this) have taken the whole bz of weight loss into something almost scientific.  Why? Because, with the keto strategy, you can get some keto sticks and check ur urine (or blood) and see if ur intake is what ur intending it to be. I think most people who remain in a ketotic state for at least a week or two will drop pounds with this and often quickly so. I’m working on just how to best use this as are many others on the AP or site. Good luck with all, but if you’re looking for is something “new” and practical, not to mention with community of some real smart people, this is surely something to try. I’d also recommended the premium upgrade - for just$39/year MOST worthwhile !

Title: I love this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am using the free version of this app and have only been doing so for about 7-10 days, but this app tracks everything I need it to. I like how it tracks how many carbs and how much fat I’m eating as well as my weight loss and measurement goals. I’ve tried other weight loss plans and after spending an insane amount of money and being hungry all the time and not losing any weight I am confident this one will work. I work nights which is especially challenging for weight loss and I tend to just mindlessly eat constantly. Every time I head to the refrigerator to put something in my mouth I say my new mantra, “if you’re not hungry, don’t eat” and it seems to be working. I know that sounds stupid. Instead I grab some seltzer or a stick of gum. Thank you.

Love, love, love this app! I can do a meal prep for everyday to make sure I’m at or below my macros.  I do not like eating the same thing every day (except for eggs, I love eggs) so this allows me to mix our meals up.  BUT the best feature is the bar code scanner, AMAZING!!!  Let me put it this way, my husband stopped going grocery shopping because I scan everything and I mean everything 🥒🍠🍗🍖🍕🥦🌭🌮🌯🍨🍯🥧🍣🥩 to make sure it’s Keto friendly.  The last time we went I saw him putting things in the cart.  I was like “what are you doing, I have to scan everything!”.  He threw his hands up 🙌 in the air and said “That’s it!  You are certifiably nuts 🤪 and I’ll be in the car.”.  I did purchase the items he put in the cart and I apologized when I got to the car.

Title: Tracking your food & drink intake to be successful!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app!  I have safely lost 11 pounds in two months at 67 years old.  It is so easy especially if you track your glucose and ketones.  This app has the ability to enter those numbers and get your true Ketone status called the GKI number.   The best part of being on the Keto diet for me is I am NOT hungry!  That makes it extremely easy to follow!  I don’t have my evil cravings tempting me on this eating plan.  There are many ways to do Keto wrong. This app helps to guide you especially if you enter your foods, measurements (weight, glucose and ketones) to do this correctly.  Read all the information you can for knowledge is power.  This app has all the tools to help you be successful. All you need to do is make it happen for yourself!

Title: Seriously worth every penny !!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
A sweet friend of mine has been after me to try the Keto diet again and I have been using another Keto app that is super expensive and renews every six months.  So when I told her about it, she said try this one.  It’s a yearly fee and much less expensive than the other one I was using.  I can do so much with this app and I use it every single day to track all my foods, exercise etc on the Keto diet.  I can plan my meals days in advance which helps with staying healthy.  I’m still learning all of the bells and whistles but this app offers a ton of flexibility and options for tracking everything !!!!  This is worth every single penny and you’ll be glad you spent the money.  This has been a HUGE help in my healthy weight loss journey !!!!

Title: Great free app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m on week 2 of Keto and have been using the free version of Carb Manager. What a fantastic app! It helps me log my food and see how much fat, protein and carbs I have left for each day! It has have every type of food I’ve searched for so far, even Keto Connect recipes and nutritional info for a local low carb bakery in ATL. It gives me reminders to log in my meals a few times a day and I really feel this is helping keep my Keto on track and helping me learn nutritional values of foods that I eat. It also gives the foods a Keto rating grade, to let you know if it’s Keto friendly or not. And this is all free! I may upgrade to the paid version eventually when I get more involved in recipes, but I’m just keeping it pretty simple for now.

Title: Type 2 diabetes
----------------------------------------------------------
I was told I was at risk for type 2 diabetes, so I knew I had to do something, but I thought, if I haven't figured it out by now how am I going to do it?  I decided to try this app for guidance and it's been a week, including Thanksgiving, and I lost 4 lbs.  I am still learning, but there is so much I don't understand, like I have know idea what a diabetic carb is!  Is it good or bad?  So I do wish for more info.  Also my Dr said to eat up to 45 carbs A MEAL, but this app encourages 44 carbs for the entire day!  So I'm assuming diabetic carbs are different.  Despite my lack of education about all this, the app does help me see what foods are good and which are best avoided and what the amount limits are.  For that I am grateful.

Title: Some limitations - but overall really great
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a smart, simple app that's easy to use. It adds partial carbs into your daily total, so you don't end up with lots of uncounted fractions. It doesn't have much a database of branded foods -- just foods themselves -- so you don't have to sift through a list (as on WW or Atkins) that's basically a commercial. You can search using just a few letters. On the down side, carb counts in the app don't always match counts on packaging. There's no way to mark favorites, so you always have to re-find foods. A lot of low-carb vegetarian staples are not listed (why not unsweetened soy milk?) But as a decent, easily adaptable, free app that's not tied to a giant corporation trying to profit off of yo-yo dieters, it gets all the love.

Title: Incredibly awesome diet app!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Although it takes a few days to master this app, it is the most comprehensive carb counting diet app I’ve seen!  If you don’t have complete nutritional information to help you count your daily carb intake, you can scan the product barcode and it will tell you what the nutritional information is.  It has an extensive database of homemade and name brand foods and you can enter recipes and the app will provide the nutritional information.  All your inputted information can be saved to the database and the app administrators will double check the nutritional information and fill in the other macronutrients for you.  I’ve lost 13 pounds on the low carb diet in one month and this app has made it possible for me to make good choices.

Title: The only Keto app I will ever use!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve tried a few apps but none as complete and detailed as this. I learned about the new HCG Keto Protocol 3.0. So, I decided to finally purchase the premium version which allows me to readjust my macros for carb macros cycling and intermittent fasting. It’s the only calculator that accommodates this diet protocol. It would be nice if the developers added a way to record the HCG protocol phases. Phase 1 is the Loading Phase and can be recorded in the “ease into the diet”. But it currently doesn’t work. Also, if there’s a way to have multiple goals to set up for each phase, that would be great. Finally,  there should be a “ Medications” section where we could add relevant prescription meds such as HCG or appetite suppressants.

Title: This App Keeps me on Track
----------------------------------------------------------
I have tried everything kind of weight loss plan for the last 20 + years. My father in law suggested keto and I knew it meant some hard core dedication but it had to be done. At first I looked for a book to push and motivate me but then I realized I don’t want to carry a book around with me everyday so I started looking for an app for the phone since my phone is always with me. Carb Manager has saved my life. Down almost 40 lbs in 6 weeks cause I always got the app, the database, and the scanner which really helps. I couldn’t do what I am doing or stay track with my goals without this app. Don’t waste your money on a book or diet food. Eat real food and get healthy! I Highly recommend to get Carb Manager! A life saver!

Title: This app is essential for keto
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app religiously (macro tracking, not weight tracking—i haven’t stepped on a scale) since I started the keto plan. It has been instrumental in my loss of several inches off my waist only seven weeks ago. I have maintained constant ketosis since, rarely having my carbs exceed 21 g per day (and never over 30) since I started. Doing this without an easy tracking method would’ve been impossible. I had nearly given up on weight loss, and I’ve never had any diet or weight loss program achieve such dramatic results do quickly. I now am confidently looking down the road to reaching my lifelong goal of fitness and “average” weight at the age of 53. This app is the best app I’ve ever downloaded, hands down!

Title: By Far the most helpful Keto Ap
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been practicing Keto for 6 months now and just began with this ap a couple of weeks ago. It has made everything so clear and easy to see exactly where I am at every day. I am the type of person that enjoys facts and not a person that enjoys tedious tasks so being able to scan my main foods in just once and then add them to my personal food list to click on each day as I eat has made it as factual and easy as possible. I would recommend this for non-Keto people too, it really helps you stay in touch with what your consuming no matter what results you are looking for. I upgraded to the premium because I want to see my nutrition stats as that is what matters most to me but the recipes will be a great addition too.

Title: Carb control
----------------------------------------------------------
I have changed how I eat two years ago. The first year I did very well, in fact with each weigh-in I was either at a loss or a plateau, never a gain. Then I started having moments of “cheating” where I would spend a day or three eating whatever I wanted. I always gained and always felt sickly. I could not get back to the great place I was in at the beginning. This was partly because I felt I knew what to eat and as such didn’t keep tabs on my consumption of fats/carbs. Once I found this app I feel like I’m back on track to keeping a tighter control on my consumption. The app is easy to use and has great lists for plugging in your foods. I also like the scan feature. It helps me be more accountable to me.

Title: Easy to use! More than a diet app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I started out using this app to track my carbs. At my age (looking at 70, soon) I wanted to be more pro active in preventing many conditions that come with age and genetics. This app is perfect for me. I especially like how the scan feature helps me at the grocery store! I decided to purchase the upgraded version. Shortly after that, I was diagnosed with kidney disease. The upgraded version allows me to track the micronutrients that are now restricted in my menus! My numbers began to fall into almost normal range. My nephrologist was amazed at how well I was managing my dietary restrictions. When I told him about Carb Manager, he said he would look into it for several other patients. THANK YOU, CM.

Title: Great App but...
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is great and i love using it and would pay for the premium if i could afford it. One huge problem though is that you have to check the nutrients on every single thing you  scan in because people seem to think putting in the wrong amounts makes things healthier 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ why lie to yourself. I even had one that took off 30 carbs! Im astounded people would lie to themselves. So either put in your own foods or double check the servings and nutrients so you dont think its healthier than it is. Other than that yes id recommend this app and premium. It works lovely with fitbit too. Syncs everything immediately so you have updated amounts based on your daily routine and any added exercise.

Title: Amazing KETO/ LOW CARB lifestyle app
----------------------------------------------------------
This is the most detailed, up-to-date, useful Keto/ Low Carb app I’ve found. I’ve tried 4 different ones- which were all fine but lacked one thing or another until I found CarbManager. It has everything you need and more. It even has a place to enter ketone readings. This app will calculate your macros, customize your meal plans, provide recipes, give you access to helpful articles, etc. It is REALLY detailed; You can do a lot with it. You can track and log your goals, weight, body measurements, exercise, food, water, supplements, ketone readings, and even create/ log your own recipes and meals (although the library they have is seemingly endless). It’s great. Try for a month. It’s fantastic.

Title: Very helpful tool to a healthier you!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has been extremely helpful in my journey to a healthier life. I used it for quite a while without purchasing the membership and it allows you to log all your food and exercise. The membership is awesome if you are just starting out. You can enter food sensitivities or foods that you want to avoid if you don’t care for them. It will literally generate a week long meal planner and give you a grocery list!! Or you can browse the recipes and add them to your favorites to try now or later. It’s an awesome app overall and you can even get involved in the carb manager community for support or link up with friends or family members to help support one another. I highly recommend this app!

----------------------------------------------------------
I had tried keeping track of all of the keto rules and adding them up and guessing at this and that and I was actually overdoing it on the calorie count so my weight-loss plateaued a lot. I paid for the premium upgrade and it is so easy it also suggests recipes that are quick and easy and super tasty things that I will probably include in my recipe plan for the rest of my life great substitutes that are very low or no carbAnd you can easily just keep track of what you eat and if you fall off the wagon eat a burger or fries it shows you how you can adjust your eating for the rest of the day so you don’t really destroy all your progress can’t speak highly enough about this it’s great

Title: This app makes keto lifestyle simple
----------------------------------------------------------
I am at a lost of words. At first I was trying to be cheap and use the free version. Then I purchased the advance subscription for a year and in the first two days I broke my plato because I was able to count my macros. I thought I would never understand the macro thing until now. Don’t disregard the macro counting ESPECIALLY if you’re using keto for weight lost. last but not least you can put in your own recipes. This is very useful if you are making meals for a large family because the app will help you keep track of your macros by entering your personal proportions size after you’ve login the full recipe. Long story short save yourself time energy and hassle and get this app!!!

Title: Makes all the difference!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have attempted the Keto diet (admittedly not the strictest adherence) several times with decent results. I had never really calculated macros or really counted anything but carbs. This time, I am using Carb Manager and it has made all the difference!! I see exactly how many carbs, calories, fat, protein, etc I need to take in for the day and keeping to this formula I have lost weight much faster. It’s really helped me see why I wasn’t as successful with my previous attempts. Every food I’ve searched for so far has been preloaded into the app so it’s easy to know the nutritional information for everything I’m eating. Have recommended this app to many family members and friends!!

Title: Best Keto / LCHF App in World
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is so strong and so easy to use! I actually bought it by mistake in August 2018 without reading any reviews or checking it out and was totally annoyed at myself. So, then I started using it and now I’m a huge fan.  I have little patience and I don’t like having to take time to figure out an interface for data. The  foods and water tracking entry process is super fast and visually intuitive, the database is impressively vast and it is really simple to add a recipe or import one from its url. Also, there are a whole bunch of premium recipes - the ones I’ve tried have been favorites. I’ve been Keto / LCHF for 5 years and this app is the best I’ve seen for tracking. Thanks!

Title: Great visual representation of nutrition
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using this app a few weeks ago. I love the visual representation of my day. I’m not sticking to the plan how I should, but the blame for that is on me, not the program. I know if I do it right and actually get the exercise I need, I will see great results. Like everything else, I need discipline to follow through. The pie chart representation is nice for the macros of what you have eaten for the day. Then for your progress to your daily calorie allowance you follow a bar that shows your total calorie allowance and how many you’ve had so far. When I open the app throughout the day it opens to the correct page where i can see at a glance how my day is going. Great app!

----------------------------------------------------------
“Lightening fast” it is not- when it decides it won’t connect through a wifi that has been working with it & many other apps all day. So I go to the app store and see it has an update- hmm, that downloads fine but I “couldn’t connect” all afternoon?? I truly hate when developers force upgrades to continue access. BUT no required update was mentioned in-app?? Also I did not realize I had to have a connection to enter or EVEN REVIEW my foods- super inconvenient!!! That meant I had to resort to writing everything down on paper all afternoon! I don’t mind limited access to the food db, but we should be able to access favorites and our previous logs without an internet connection.

This app has been great! It really allows me to keep track of everything I am taking in. I log everything down to the salt and pepper I add. It just makes me feel better knowing what I have made and what works. I look at it as a way to eventually have a meal plan that I love. So far, I have enjoyed everything I have eaten on this KETO Health Plan. My husband was having some medical issues and I decided to make it a healthy change for us both to keep him from being tempted by cravings. I’ve been on it for 2 weeks and have gone from 158 lbs to 151 lbs. I sure didn’t expect it to work so quickly, but it definitely motivates me to keep going. This app helps to keep me on track.

----------------------------------------------------------
Started my keto journey a little over two months ago with the carb manager app and can not recommend it enough. Everything that I eat goes into carb manager and wow is it enlightening. The app keeps me absolutely on track and I know for sure I could not just estimate my macros accurately. The upgrade (paid) version is a must as it makes all the brand names available as well as great recipes. I honestly believe the app has kept me going on keto. For informations sake- I am doing keto for body composition and metabolic purposes, weight lift frequently, etc. but for anyone trying to loose weight you MUST count your macros and carb manager makes it so easy!! Highly recommended.

Title: Love this APP
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this App and have already lost 10lbs after only using it for a week and 1/2. The ease of use along with the ability to log weight, inches, macros, calories, and anything anyone would want or need to track make this a great app. The only complaint I have is the need to update some of the macros in some of the foods and an issue with the scanning of foods. Sometimes when I scan some items, it will not add the calories and the macros into my tracker so I needed to google the foods to make sure I was adding the correct information to my tracker. Other than that, absolutely no complaints. I have a lot more to lose and know this App will help me get to where I want to be.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks so much for that great review, Busybelle! 10 lbs in two weeks is amazing, and shows the power of low carb/Keto eating. We'd love to hear more about the issues that you've run into with the scanner; our support team can likely get those sorted out for you. You can contact them in the app via Settings - Contact Support. Cheers!

----------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to start Keto but didn’t know where to start. I didn’t have the time to calculate all the macros of recipes and find ones that work together to hit my goals every day. This app does it all!! I can choose which recipes I want and it’ll arrange it through the week along with snacks to make it all work. Then it makes a shopping list for me to make it even easier!!! My only complaint is the categories of the shopping list. Garlic has its own category. Kind of weird when it’s with the produce. Also, pork chops were listed under bone, not meat. It’s all in the same place at the store so I don’t know why it’s separated on the list. But all together this app is awesome!!

My husband also uses the app ( not a premium member though) and he is SOOO impressed with how well CarbMaster operates and presents the information AND it works without glitches. The bar code scanner works well and makes product info entries a breeze!! Also foods in the database ...the numbers seem MUCH more acurate. This is our favorite diet app now!! Oh and it integrates with Apple Health! Another plus!!

I lost 20 lbs, and stayed there for two months. Then I got this app and it has been amazing!! I have dropped another five lbs! It's not hard to see myself on a size seven, started as a size twenty four,I'm  a ten now :-)  It's super easy to use, shows all your Nutrition values, vitamins, and more!! I can also add items when I can't find them, along with adding  all the specs. Without this App I seriously don't think I could have figured out how to drop my last thirty pounds, thank you for this wonderful App!!!

----------------------------------------------------------
Fortunately still treating my diabetes with pills but the way things have been going insulin injections did not seem far away. Thought I would try the low carb idea and found this app to help. Can’t believe what has happened in the first full week. Lost 3 pounds and my blood sugar has dropped 30 points by watching my carbs. I really hope these levels sustain. Feeling great too. Amazing app!!! Also have come up with new way to catalog foods into food “groups” - edit each new entry with a 2 letter code + a dash and a space so an apple would be (Fr- apple). Fr = fruit. With a lot of foods it seems it will make it easier down the road to find things grouped by a category.

----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve used Lose It several times to log food over the years, most recently, a 450 day streak. Although I’ve only used this app for 24 hours there are a couple of key differences that make it better if you’re doing KETO. (1) ability to choose your own macros easily and then how it presents them in the daily log. It just works better. (2) How recipes are presented in premium versions are better with CM. (3) The “insights” in lose it were exciting, but they weren’t useful. I think CM has more useful info and less hype. (4) everything else you’d expect in a modern day high end food app is there... and then some. Easy food logging, big database, details out the kazoo etc.

I’ve been using this app daily for over a year now and it’s just an amazing tool! I find it very intuitive to use and very informative.  I think the fact that I can create a recipe, save it and then instantly see that recipe available with all the macros already figured up is amazing! If you’re on the fence about the premium service remember this. If you have a Fitbit, Garmin, iPhone or iwatch you can sync it to the Carb Manager app. Any exercise you then do will automatically chance you daily requirements based on calories burned. To me that alone is worth it. Not to mention the extensive list of recipes and advanced features. This is an app that won’t disappoint.

Title: Keto Macro app is a game changer
----------------------------------------------------------
I was doing well on Keto but not great and admittedly a bit overwhelmed by many new concepts and food prep as well as getting my initial grocery shopping lists and items together to support this new journey.  I’ve read a lot and watched many videos and clearly doing Keto the best way includes ensuring you count your macros.  Now that I’ve been diligent with using this app, I better understand-I would say starting Keto is a totally life changing process and using the app is great but could be a bit too much at the very beginning if someone wasn’t at all familiar.  My suggestion would be 30-60 days into the Keto journey for someone new to Keto.  Great app thank you.

I used this app while doing keto a few years ago and I am now using to track my macro nutrients. I tried Weight Watchers but I like to know all the nutrients that I am consuming. This app has some many features that I am about to purchase premium, but even using it for free us everything I need right now, tracking nutrients, linked to apple health to track my steps, and the best feature of all is the scanner where you just scan the barcode on the food you eat and everything pops up. My girlfriend and I are trying to live a healthier lifestyle and this app is a big eye opener on the foods we eat and it helps to keep ourselves accountable and make better decisions.

----------------------------------------------------------
I was training for another figure competition and my trainer had me on a “kind of” Keto plan. My meal plan was “Keto” like for 2 of the many weeks of my training. Every week I had to take progress pics and the weeks end my Keto plan was where I saw the better results. So after my competition I added carbs back for 2 weeks and then went straight Keto. I lost more weight than the app anticipated. At a high activity level, I was expected to lose 2 lbs a week. I weighed in at 150.5 on a Saturday and by Friday I was down to 144.5. I wanted to maintain 145 so hopefully the maintenance phase I’m on will keep me at this weight. Otherwise I’ll be forced to eat more. LOL!

I did Keto last year with some good success. Returning to Keto was a little tough, but finding this app to track food, water and activity is a WINNER! My first two weeks, I was a little reluctant but this is SO easy! It gives me a great view of my daily habits and choices and how they can affect my success. So many foods are preloaded and not just individual foods, but something like instant rice with chicken bouillon (not a good choice!), different size tomatoes and even measurements just as you would use in recipes. The detail is wonderful! Thanks for making a great app that I look forward to using to help me work my way to the best year and best health ever!

Title: Great keto/carb tracking app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app. It really takes the guesswork out of carb tracking, especially with net carbs. It is very user friendly. The free version is fantastic but the paid version is more than worth the small yearly fee (or monthly if you’re not big into commitment). I always hesitate to try out new tracking apps because I find most food data bases lag far behind MFP. I have not come across one food in the last two weeks that wasn’t in their data base! So far, I would say the data base is totally on par with MFP, the customization is easier and more thorough than MFP, and the premium subscription is cheaper than MFP.  Carb Manager is now my tracking app of choice!

I’m 59. I’ve had Type I Diabetes for 46 years. I’ve been eating Keto foods for three years but have struggled to get the % of macros right, maintain tight blood sugar control and stay in ketosis.—-Not any more.—-I can literally record my food, glucose, insulin and many other facts within minutes. The % of macros is updated with each food item.  I can print it and bring to my dr. I am not tech friendly and I managed to teach myself and navigate in a couple hours.  This app will extend my life because it has simplified and accelerated the recording of everything: And that means I do it ALL DAY LONG. Every day. That’s the difference. That’s a life changer.

Title: Amazing!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app makes tracking food and tracking macros SO easy!!! HUGE database of foods, 99% of food that I scan show up. The developers have thought of every little detail to make your life easier- entering a recipe and calculating the calories and macros for you, being able to copy anything (one food, one recipe, all your foods for a particular meal, etc) to a different day, even adjusting the visuals to the way you like it. This is seriously an amazing app!! Note- I did spend the money on the premier subscription almost immediately so I’m not sure which features are included and which are not but if you’re considering it, it’s definitely worth the money!

Title: Review
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve used Carb Manager for about 2yrs. I’ve tried other health apps before but I keep going back to Carb Manager. I’m almost 60 and I find it one of the most user friendly health apps out there.  It’s not only for keto dieters but for anyone who wants to keep track of their carbohydrate intake. I love the pie chart, the tracking chart showing my weight loss and the comment section. I like to type in a little note on how the day went and the weight chart give me inspiration when I see my weight trending down. If your new to theses type of apps I would recommend Carb Manager. I’ve shared it with my daughter and son in law and they now are both using it.

Title: Incredible App!
----------------------------------------------------------
Bravo to the programmer(s) who put this app together. It’s the best app I have ever used, just wish I would have found it sooner. I have been on a keto low carb diet for a year and lost 42 pounds. Found this app and now I am doubling my monthly rate of weight loss from an average of 3.5 pounds a month to 7 pounds a month. This app is so easy and educational to use. You don’t have to be on a keto low carb diet to benefit from using it as it tracks calories too. I find it enjoyable to use and can’t wait each morning to put in my new weight and what I had for breakfast and other meals and see my glide path to my goals. Congratulations to the programmers!

Title: This app is amazing
----------------------------------------------------------
I had downloaded this app awhile ago but used another food tracking app until recently.  I decided to give this one a try, and am very happy that I did.  I like the way that the app tracks carbs and, especially, that it allows you to track vitamin supplements.  There are many other health-related factors that can be tracked besides weight, and this feature is very useful to me.  When using the other app, I was wishing that it included certain features.  My regret about this one is that I didn’t give it a closer look earlier - all the features that I want in a nutrition and physical well-being app are included in Carb Manager.  Outstanding!

Title: Best app ever for weight loss and management
----------------------------------------------------------
I previously used 3 apps to do what Carb manager does. I tried the free version and definitely saw the value of premium. I use it every day. I manage ketones, fasting, meals, weight, measurements water and I can import recipes plus review easy and very good recipes. It has meal plans, grocery lists, corny contests😬, and even lets me know what I can eat with what macros I have left. Oh and the coolest part is that it is one size fits all! Whether you are on keto, keto cycling, regular, building muscle, you name it you can add in what ratios you want. I’ve lost 35 lbs so far for the year and 22 of that was just in the 4 months using the app!

Title: Great App
----------------------------------------------------------
As a newbie, this app really helped in figuring out what a daily intake should look like for me. I love the resources and connections. And as nerdy as it is, I LOVE the visual representation of intake. As with most apps of this nature, I wish there was a setting to determine your day. Meaning, I work night shift, so my 24 hour day spans 2 actual days, because I'm waking up and starting my day at 3pm and ending it around 9am. Any goals for "the day" are technically not met due to a conventional time frame being applied to an unconventional schedule. It's a small and kind of insignificant inconvenience. But it's important to night shifters.

Title: Great App but I wish it did this.....
----------------------------------------------------------
I am so glad I came across this app. It has helped me tremendously in figuring out my keto diet. It automatically gives me the % of carbs (net AND total! Yay!) proteins and fats. I appreciate the "scan barcode" feature as it makes logging packaged foods so easy. The only thing that is missing for me is the ability to log your own recipe and have it figure out the percentages per serving size. That would be incredibly helpful. I believe you have to pay for the yearly subscription for that feature. Even my free calorie counter app gave that option. Otherwise, this has been wonderful in helping me keep track of my food, water and exercise.

Title: Love it so far!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have only had this app for a week and after a few days I did buy the paid version (I really needed all the extra help!). Totally worth it so far!! I have lost 4 lbs this week because I am staying on target!! I love all the ways I can track what I am doing, and I have not even really dug into the recipes yet due to time constraints, but definitely will! This app really is perfect if you are doing keto. Five stars from me! Thanks for this great app! My only wish is that I could at least access My Foods data I have added and add meals/info even if off line. Then it could update/sync when back online. That would be a phenomenal update!!

Title: Thanks for the App.
----------------------------------------------------------
I started the keto lifestyle December 20, 2018. The first two days were grueling trying to calculate everything on paper. I then discovered the Carb Manager app. Thank you for the this App. Without it it would be very difficult. I’ve been to amusement parks and I’m able to use it to locate keto friendly food. Or use it on all my travels. I travel a lot for work. I do not know how it compares to other apps, as I have no need to go look. This app fits everything I need to look up and use. I am using the freeware version. So far I have not needed to switch to premium. But I may try it out to see what’s so different. Great job keep it up!

Title: Best app for Keto/Low Carb out there
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve used sone other general nutrition/weight loss tracking apps over the years and have my tried and true go to, but when I decided to change to the keto lifestyle it was cumbersome to use.  I found a lot of different apps labeled keto and low carb and by far this one is hands down the best. I’m still on the free version and it honestly meets all my needs and I haven’t found any negatives so far. Once in a blue moon there may be a good I don’t find but I can enter that on. I’m definitely planning to upgrade to premium for the added benes. For anyone new to keto I would definitely recommend this app to really help you stay on track.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Now that's a glowing review. Thanks so much, Suzy! We really appreciate you. There are plenty of other fitness apps out there, but we're pretty sure that we're the most robust Keto/Low carb specific app on the market. Thrilled to hear that you're thinking about Premium! While the free version has all of the basics to succeed with Keto, Premium users typically report 3X the results of Premium users. Let us know if we can ever help with anything else!

Title: Great app
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is easy to use, and has been very educational. It has been guiding me in my new effort to go Keto, which is the opposite of my previous lifestyle, which i used to think was very health-conscious.  The carb content of some foods is surprising. The way things add up over the day is interesting. I am tip-toeing my way, hopefully to better health and i am grateful for the help of this app. So many apps like this are charging monthly fees.  I cannot see that they could be doing a better job, and this one is, thankfully, free. I am pretty sure this app can help you to be more nutritionally savvy too.  Here's to our health!

Title: Best app ever!
----------------------------------------------------------
Started the Keto diet 2 weeks ago and needed a good way to keep track of carbs. I was using another weight loss app but didn’t feel I was getting the most accurate information. Then I found Carb Manager! Not only has it helped me manage my carb intake, but also helps me see my fat goals and protein goals. I found some errors in my meal planning and was able to make the necessary changes thanks to this app! I love that I can scan the foods I eat which makes logging very easy. As well as being able to create my own recipes and save to my favorites. Considering going premium so I can see what else this awesome app has to offer!

Title: Great for keto diet
----------------------------------------------------------
This app allows you to track almost everything related to your diet and health. I’ve started to use this on 8/12 and today is 8/20 and so far I’ve lost 6 lbs , granted that I’ve incorporated 15,000 steps per day which also contributed to the weight loss. I gave it a 4 star because when you are creating your own recipe and make a mistake, you cannot move the cursor to where the error is. Instead, you have to place it at the end of that sentence or line and hit the backspace until you get to the error. It’s a bit annoying. Otherwise, I live this app. I would recommend to anyone on a keto diet plan or trying to control sugar.

Title: Game changer
----------------------------------------------------------
If you are serious about Keto, or any change of your diet this is a must have app. The free version is good enough, but if you are serious about changing your diet; less than $5 a month should be a no brainer. The app allows you to log your food various ways and does a great job in breaking your meals and food down to see where your diet can improve. It does take a short time to log, but it can be eye opening to see how much is really in the food we eat. If you truly value the opportunity you have to change your life through your diet. The time and money will be nothing in comparison to what you can get out of this app.

Title: Great app but PRO needs this one thing
----------------------------------------------------------
I love that you can integrate the health app so it can take into account calories burned throughout the day. The only problem is it does nothing with this info. You can view net calories by going into nutrition and goals but I want to be able to track net calories on the nutrition wheel. Seeing I have eaten 2000 but have to remember to subtract my Calories burned is a nuisance. My fitness pal integrates this into their app and also allows you program what macros those calories will be allocated to. So if I need to eat an extra 400 calories because I worked out I can say I want a 60/35/5 split. Please add this feature.
