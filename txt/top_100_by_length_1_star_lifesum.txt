Title: Misleading
----------------------------------------------------------
My family and I do a Paleo/Whole Foods lifestyle which means we eat very clean with sugars that are non-processed like honey, maple syrup, and dates in limited amounts. I found this app very misleading because certain carbs are rated unhealthy but it then tells you your carb count is low and to eat more???? Which is essentially what the paleo diet is: low carb and higher protein with healthy fat choices. As an example Cassava flour is 100% carbs so it is rated as üòê but your total daily intake of calories will tell you to eat more? If your rating certain carb foods as üòê but pushing increased carb content how in the world is someone supposed to eat carbs unless it is essentially fruit based. I will state white potatoes are rated 88% carbs but are also a great nutrient source which is misleading again. So I do realize the app is pushing a healthier choice of carb but when food is mixed in the right proportions cassava can be a healthy choice so again??? Secondly, cashews and other nuts are not a healthy choice if they are in flour form but again in the right proportions they can be. Third, Ghee, avocado, and olive oil are not considered healthy choices either. Lastly, you can eat meat sources on the app (red meat) which drastically increases your fat intake for the day which is rated as a great source of nutrients and minerals. The concept is a good idea but very misleading and costly if you pay for the in app purchases which I will not do. I will be going back to my FatSecret because there is no ‚Äúfood shaming‚Äù going on in that app. By the way if your going to rate foods based on ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù maybe developers should consider a system that rates the use of pesticide and herbicide exposure along with nutrient depleted farmlands that have even vegetables highly unhealthy!

Title: I wanted this to work.
----------------------------------------------------------
I wanted this app to work, I really did. I feel as if I was a bit misled while researching an app. I needed a meal plan for every day with a grocery list. Well, guess what? You‚Äôll get that, but with only certain ‚Äúplans.‚Äù  I‚Äôm not vegetarian. I‚Äôm not into paleo. I surely don‚Äôt want to eat like Denise every day. You‚Äôll get enough meal options for a week.  I tried all meal tracts that came with grocery lists  (you‚Äôll get grocery lists for 4 plans, you‚Äôre on your own for the rest). I really did. For a month. The recipes provided are horrible. No taste, bland, and quite frankly, I‚Äôd rather pay $10 for bulk unsalted butter than a 4 oz container of ghee. I cooked enough for my family of four. We ended up throwing over half of every meal in the trash. The dogs would not even eat it. Money wasted because the recipes tasted like trash.  What chefs approve of these recipes? Please let me know because I‚Äôll keep an eye out for their names and avoid them. I‚Äôm open minded about different styles and food preps, but this is just bad. I 100% wasted money on this app and on the grocery store trips. The turkey on rye sandwich was the best offering of the bunch and even that‚Äôs a stretch. Yeah, I lost weight, but it was because the recipes were unappetizing, tasteless, and with the money wasted on groceries, I did not want to eat. If you are really and truly looking for help with weight loss and meal prep, please look elsewhere. This app could be great, but it‚Äôs not. So much potential, just not there yet

Title: Support unavailable
----------------------------------------------------------
Loved the interface of this app and found it easy to navigate my way around pretty easily when I did use it. The one star rating is due to my recent experience today. I have tried several times now to contact support through the Contact Us (in app chat) link and it continues to crash. The app is updated to the most recent version and so is the software on my phone. Have tried to resend the message several times and the app keeps crashing. I want to cancel my subscription and plan on deleting the app TODAY. I purchased the Premium version of the app about a year ago at a discounted rate during a promo offer they had at the time. They seem to have it set it up where you subscribe to their Premium services outside of iTunes so the subscription is actually processed through their own website. Renewal dates or expiration dates of said Premium services are nowhere to be found anywhere in the app. They then attempt to auto renew it later on at almost $50 USD with no communication beforehand via email or otherwise that they will be processing this amount. I did not even locate the option to downgrade my account or cancel anywhere within the Settings option within the Lifesum app. Luckily my bank caught the attempted transactions as fraud and did not allow them through. I‚Äôll stick to apps that allow me to manage my subscriptions within iTunes to avoid headaches like this.

Title: SCAM!!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I haven‚Äôt even started using this app because initially they were offering premium packages for better results while using this app. It varied with different packages but the prices were stating $3.33 a month and other prices around there. When I selected this premium package, willing to pay that amount a month for their services and if I ever decided I didn‚Äôt want to use the app anymore I could just cancel the subscription, right? Well when I selected this package and allowed it to charge my card, the total said $47.51. At this point it had already processed through and the only thing I could do was cancel the subscription, which I did immediately. I also immediately contacted the app support and informed them of the situation. I didn‚Äôt hear anything back from them, and the next day I got a receipt from apple saying the charge went through. I contacted them as well and only received an automated message back saying they could do nothing about it. I now am dealing with overdraft charges and can‚Äôt get through to a single person about the situation. Leading people to believe they are going to pay minimal prices and then charging $50 is completely ridiculous. And anyone who thinks paying that amount for an app that simply calculates your food intake is insane. Worst app experience ever.

Title: Hugely disappointing
----------------------------------------------------------
No room to customize, not even with the upgrade (based on the description of added features). We prepare a large number of ingredients and dishes from scratch, so logging food in Lifesum is not accurate, as we're restricted to what's in the database. Also, the inability to see what's in the upgrade, specifically diet plans is frustrating. The default plan limits users to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack, all of which are calorie restricted. So for users who consume 5-6 small meals/snacks a day, this isn't helpful. If I log meals as meals, then I'm WAY under my calorie allowance as dictated by Lifesum, and some of my snacks don't get logged. If I log all of my snacks under the single "snack" tab, my meals are way under and my snacks are way over, according to Lifesum. There also isn't a way to log times food is consumed. Lifesum is probably alright for someone interested in very basic nutritional record keeping, but for someone needing to log for medical or serious health/fitness tracking, Lifesum has completely missed the mark. And to charge ridiculous monthly fees for a product that is mediocre at best is just ludicrous. Save your time, money, and frustration and use another method.

Title: Totally Inaccurate
----------------------------------------------------------
Lifesum is beautiful and fun. But none of that matters because all the entries are inaccurate or straight up wrong. If I‚Äôm going to have the ease of using a barcode, why do I have to put in more work? If you want to be able to accurately measure and count calories, you should use grams. When I use grams on anything, the measurements are totally inaccurate. They‚Äôll make something that should be 200 calories look like 12,000 calories. Or something that should be 600 calories will come out to 3 calories, all because of inaccurate measurements on this app. Even the ‚Äúverified‚Äù entries are wrong. Sometimes I‚Äôll Enter a meal and the calories won‚Äôt show up until I fully close the app and reopen. Today I tried to search for an item from McDonald‚Äôs, and all the entries were the meal without the biscuit. And even those entries didn‚Äôt match! I‚Äôve tried to continue to use the app because I was conned in to paying for a full year. (NOTE: when it says $3/month it‚Äôs actually going to charge you for a whole year at one time.) Not worth it. I‚Äôll take my losses and use an app that‚Äôs accurate and that doesn‚Äôt make me angry because everything is hard to track and everything is just plan WRONG.

Thank you for your feedback and sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with our app. The reason we show the monthly cost, is for our users to see the difference in price from subscribing yearly and monthly. A monthly subscription is also available. We show you the total price before you pay. We are sorry if this wasn't clear enough. Our food database is partly user-created and that results in some items having inaccurate nutritional values. We recommend that you either select items verified by us or, for items that you cannot find in our database, create custom items under Favorites.

Title: Disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has great potential but after using it for less than 24 hours (yes, that's all it took), I must admit that it is a letdown. I entered my personal information, updated my goals, connected to my Fitbit, logged my food and exercise... Only to find out that the information I was inputting was not saved accurately. Regardless of how many times I changed it, my birthdate and starting weight kept reverting back to an incorrect amount (that wasn't entered by me at anytime). This led me to doubt about the application saving the other information I was entering such as calories or workouts. When I spoke to a representative, I was told this issue would be fixed in about 3 weeks. That is ridiculous! Don't launch your app until it's ready to be used. Especially one that customers pay for! Another complaint is the meal logging. It is very difficult to determine meals based on ounces or grams. There are few foods that I found that were listed by serving size or quantity. Lifesum's selection of meals is not very expansive and most days, I found myself looking up the meals with another application to ensure I was accurately logging them. NOT WORTH THE TIME.

Title: Useless unless you pay
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôll be honest. The original reason I downloaded this app what is to integrate it with the Walgreens app in order to earn bonus points at that store. Once I open the app, I found it useless. I took all kinds of quizzes which were to determine my eating habits and to suggest diets. I can‚Äôt imagine why eating vegetables watch a week or fruits just three times a week would indicate a balanced diet. Then it offered to give me suggestions. After every quiz, in order to get the answers or suggestions or meal plans or diet suggestions I was directed to sign up to get the paid version. This app is a complete rip off. I don‚Äôt have to take the time to go onto my phone just to keep track of how many glasses of water I drink! I have chronic kidney disease and was looking for a few other suggestions. Since I have to pay for everything here, I‚Äôll stick to the FREE Davita app. It‚Äôs easy to set your calorie goals (along with protein and other nutritional content). You don‚Äôt have to have CKD to use Davita, either. Their food database is enormous. Lifesum (free) is useless in conjunction with the Walgreens app.

Title: Misleading Free Info! I‚Äôm angry!
----------------------------------------------------------
I don‚Äôt like giving my permission for Facebook or signing up with my email without knowing what an app offers for Free. I thought I would be able to at least see recipes. And, oh, yes, you can see recipes - the title, nutrition, calories- a teaser!! You can‚Äôt actually see the ingredients or instructions without a Premium membership!!!! In fact, you can‚Äôt do anything, but manually add items, without an annoying pop up demanding a membership! What a waste of my time. Now I have to go find out how to delete permissions in Facebook. If you want money, then TELL ME that the free version is useless. I could have found many other apps or ways to manually add tracking data. I am not a serial 1 Star review.  I‚Äôm more of a serial 5 Star reviewer, but I‚Äôm sick of apps acting like there is a free version that offers what‚Äôs in the advertisement (and Premium stands for extra, valuable services.) The Premium in this app means you can‚Äôt do any of the advertised services without paying! That‚Äôs not what Premium means.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for rating our app. Our free version provides all tools for basic tracking and helps you reach your goal successfully and upgrading to Premium is not necessary for many users. We do appreciate your feedback!

Title: Unhappy with customer service
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is advertised as being a certain price per month so I purchased the one advertised as being $3.99 a month for a 12 month subscription which would be $44.99 for the year. I expected that I would be charged monthly as it was advertised but when I received an email with my bill I was charged the full $44.99. I reached out via email to ask about this and get a refund and the company responded that I must get permission from Apple iTunes to get this refund. So now I have to jump through hoops to get my money back and what is their response when I ask why it is advertised that way instead of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù or ‚Äúhow else can we help?‚Äù?? That I should have read the purchase before subscribing. Now that is just sneaky. Do NOT advertise your company as being a monthly payment then charge people the full amount. I‚Äôm sure it was written somewhere in tiny font that no one can even read. That is just bad customer service too. I am very disappointed with this company and how they handled this.

Title: Wrong Nutritional Info for SCANNED Items
----------------------------------------------------------
My food was cold and I had to reheat by the time I worked out all the problems with this app. I got this yesterday. Got suckered into the 3 month subscription by all of these false reviews (or perhaps completely clueless people). It allows you to scan items and just move along to add them to your food tracking. However serving sizes are wrong, calories wrong, sugars, proteins, fats‚Äîeverything. It‚Äôs different things for different items but when you look it over there is always something that is off. You literally need to sit there and go through every item even serving size, if it is tsp or tbsp to make sure the scanned item is right. I Deleted the app. I‚Äôll be asking for my money back but this trash app and it‚Äôs lazy developers will probably tell me I can‚Äôt..just like they can‚Äôt get the correct nutritional info off a label. These apps are total gimmicks. My back up plan after ‚Äúbeing had‚Äù is salad and running around‚Äîcould have spent the subscription on vegetables.

Title: Keeps getting worse!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve had this app for about 3yrs or so now. I‚Äôve had the free version and the year subscription. At first it was great but over the last couple years instead of improving it‚Äôs gotten worse. The app deleted all my previous data so I couldn‚Äôt see what I added a month ago, you use to be able to go back a year and see all data. It has reset my updated weight over and over again making it impossible to keep track. The app deletes food you‚Äôve already logged for the day so that you have to keep adding it. You try to scroll down past lunch area and it gets stuck to where you can‚Äôt see dinner or snacks.  Now today I tried to log my breakfast and lunch and the app won‚Äôt even respond. You go in to add the food and click ok and it doesn‚Äôt register at all. The app even deleted half of yesterday‚Äôs meals. I‚Äôve loved this app and it helped me lose over a hundred pounds but sadly now I‚Äôve deleted it because it doesn‚Äôt work anymore! I‚Äôm truly disappointed!!

Title: Regret I paid for premium
----------------------------------------------------------
I really want to like this app because it is very attractive, unlike MFP.  However, it needs a lot of work, especially the recipe function.  First, I found a lot of mistakes in the database, too few/many calories etc, and no way to report errors, unlike MFP.   Next, the recipe function keeps making the app crash and when I finally get a recipe entered, there is no way to edit it later.  For instance, you use a different brand a cheese the next time you make it, you can‚Äôt correct the calories/nutrition. Next, there is no website availability so you have to enter recipes in the app and personally, I can type much faster in a keyboard than a mobile device.  Last, but not least, there is no recipe import function so you do HAVE to enter each ingredient and instructions by hand, unlike MFP.  So while MFP may not have the glitzy, cutesy presentation, it is HANDS DOWN a much more functional app even without paying for their premium membership.

Hi there, we are sorry to hear that you feel this way but thank you for your feedback! Regarding the database and reporting errors there is a function for that; When you're in detailed view of a food item, please scroll down to the bottom of the page until you see the Report button. Tap on it and choose one of the five options available and click on Next to come to the next page where you can enter details. Then send the error report by clicking on Submit.

Title: Useless compared to my fitness pal
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using this app because I thought the interface was more aesthetically pleasing than my fitness pal. I was so excited that I even bought the yearly subscription. After a day I regretted it. The food database is incomplete and not accurate. For example I was tracking for a few days and was wondering why it said my fats were so high...it said a serving of grilled chicken breast had 20 grams of fat.....the scanner doesn‚Äôt work either so you‚Äôre out of luck if you can‚Äôt find. The ‚Äúrating‚Äù gets irritating as well. If you‚Äôre trying to center your carbs around when you workout it‚Äôll constantly tell you that you‚Äôre off track because your macro distribution. Would also like to see an app that has the option of Meal 1, Meal 2, Meal 3, Meal 4, Meal 5 etc. rather than breakfast lunch dinner snack. Will be going back to my fitness pal. I just wish I hadn‚Äôt spent 50 dollars on a year subscription (which adds near no value to the app)

Title: Horrible Updates
----------------------------------------------------------
I had previously LOVED this app. I bought the premium subscript, and I had absolutely no problems with syncing data from Apple health, Fitbit (my main step tracker since I don‚Äôt carry my phone with me around at work), and lifesum. But this newest update is absolute garbage. I reached out to lifesum support and followed their recommendation to delete and reinstall the app. However, now the app is choosing to import my Fitbit data for random days! So now it looks like I have a ton of days where I ate hundreds of calories over my limit because it is missing my Fitbit data (I consistently reach 10k steps nearly every day). I have tried everything listed in the FAQ and nothing works. I feel as if I have lost all of the progress and work I‚Äôve put into this app and my lifestyle for months now .... I am tempted to just delete this app and go back to myfitnesspal. Hopefully you guys in app development will figure this out soon!!!

I‚Äôve used this app before & it worked really well. Recently I got it again and it worked for a week. Today I was inputting my breakfast, water, lunch etc. but it wouldn‚Äôt work. I tried to add my cups of water, but nothing happened. My app ending up freezing & not working. I existed out & tried again, but the same thing kept happening. So I uninstalled the app, then reinstalled it and now it won‚Äôt let me log in. It‚Äôs saying my email is wrong, but it‚Äôs not. My email works perfectly fine & I know this because I went in my emails to make sure my email is still working & I was getting a bunch of emails. The app keeps saying to recheck my information, but all of my information is right. I know this because I write down all of my usernames & passwords and I put exactly what I wrote down into the app and it‚Äôs telling me it‚Äôs wrong. I was doing so good with tracking my foods, my water & my exercise and now the app doesn‚Äôt work.

Title: Very disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
I am so beyond sick of fighting with this app. If you care anything about tracking your macros correctly- go with myfitnesspal. I‚Äôm frustrated that I upgraded to premium only to hate this app so much, I dread using it. Everything I scan- has the wrong info and often times the barcode is associated with the wrong food item. So I edit each time, carefully putting in the exact info off the food packaging, only to have it tell me calories etc are wrong and not allow me to save it! Why bother?  I also hate that it won‚Äôt allow me to track other things, like vitamin content- except for potassium. Also a joke that it won‚Äôt allow you to remove food items you create, or most of all, edit them. Which is exactly why you see so many duplicate items created by ppl on here. I know I sometimes change my recipes up, so why not allow me to change it on here?  This app has been around too long to be this dysfunctional.

Title: This company stole my money
----------------------------------------------------------
I purchased a premium membership on May 24th, 2018 for $29.99. It is now February 27, 2019. For several weeks I used the Ketogenic Strict diet plan and then tried out several other plans in the app. After a few months I fell off the plan. I never deleted the app but did log out. I am now attempting a lifestyle change again and logged in to my account using the email I originally purchased my membership under. The app now tells me I need to resubscribe to premium and am only on a free access account. On the free account you can‚Äôt use the Keto diet plans. I should not have to resubscribe when I already purchased a subscription that has 2 more active months. This app stole money from me by changing my account status without my consent. I do not recommend this app due to this shady practice. No telling how many thousands of other people have had this happen to them without realizing it.

Title: Not worth the price
----------------------------------------------------------
I would say this app has great potential, but it is still in its beginning phases for sure, and therefore shouldn‚Äôt be charging $50 annually for the premium. It‚Äôs just not worth that. I like the look of it, it‚Äôs not too difficult to navigate. But, every time I scan a food item, it is either not in the system and I have to add it, or the nutritional information or measurements are incorrect. (Sometimes the calories are correct but it says the standard serving is 1 cup instead of 1 tbsp, etc). I would say this is the case for 85% of foods that I add to my day and it gets so frustrating having to change everything. I wouldn‚Äôt mind having to add a new food or correct something every once in awhile, but I feel like it happens literally every day.  Even items from big companies like Quaker are not in the system sometimes. Pretty disappointing considering how much I paid.

Title: Meal Plans are a Bust
----------------------------------------------------------
I subscribed to Premium to access the meal plans. I‚Äôm on day 3 and am very frustrated with the recipes...the Carrot Soup with Garlic Creme Fraiche omits most of the instructions and I had to search through the Recipes tab to find something similar (but not exact). The measurements are in an odd combination of deciliter, cups, grams, and the occasional teaspoon or tablespoon, all in one recipe. The Turkey Spinach Omelette and Quinoa with Eggplant and Spinach are terrible recipes...they do not include anything in the way of spice or flavoring and are inedible as-is. Tracking plan meals is buggy - sometimes they do not show up in your calorie count and sometimes they do. The recipe for the Crispbread with Apple, Cream Cheese, and Walnuts tracks as 2298 calories and there is no way to fix the calorie count. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed...I do NOT recommend this app.

Title: Befriend your hunger?! Absolutely not.
----------------------------------------------------------
Took the test to see which meal plan I should follow and my ‚Äúnutritional advisor‚Äù, Lykke, told me ‚ÄúWhen you befriend your hunger, you can lose weight without actually changing your lifestyle‚Äù. My recommended meal plan was to eat what I want 5 days a week, and fast 2 days a week. Are you KIDDING ME?!?!? Please someone else agree with me that this is unhealthy both physically and mentally. I mean really??? A NUTRITIONAL ADVISOR is helping me meal plan by telling me NOT TO EAT FOR TWO DAYS. Outrageous. This type of ‚Äúmeal plan‚Äù is what encourages eating disorders. I pray this portion of the app can be removed in order to spare others from the damage it may potentially cause. I understand in limited circumstances the reason for a fast, but encouraging ongoing multi-day fasts is damaging in more ways than one. Thanks, but I will never ‚Äúbefriend my hunger‚Äù.

Title: No no no no
----------------------------------------------------------
I cannot begin to describe how angry and disappointed I am in this app. This app is working fine for me until I scrolled past their ad for their monthly subscription which said was three dollars and something cents a month. How misleading. I bought the subscription thinking I was going to pay three dollars a month, and they charged me the next day for $50 for a full year. Not to mention, they also say in their ad that you can cancel this subscription at any time, but that is awesome misleading and untrue because there is no option available for you to cancel it. And even if I was able to cancel it I doubt that I would see a penny of my money back. I have already emailed them I hope to get my money back, but with the experience I have had with them already, I doubt it will. I seriously would never ever recommend this app for anyone to use or buy from.

Title: Never Works
----------------------------------------------------------
The app should be great. And if it actually functioned it would be. I get pretty angry at this point when I get prompted to spend money on this thing because I‚Äôve had the basic app for ages now and every time I resolve to use it I‚Äôm reminded why I stopped before the day is even out. I can never even add all of my food to my daily intake because it just will not load anything for days at a time. Then it magically works for maybe 24 hours, and then asks me to pay for their subscription. I say no, and the app won‚Äôt load anything again. I don‚Äôt know if this is intentional but honestly it‚Äôs frustrating because I want to be able to use it, and I pay for other health and fitness apps, but this thing just never lives up to expectations. Editors choice my butt, I don‚Äôt believe all these 5 star reviews aren‚Äôt just fake with how shoddy this app actually works.

Title: Not Enough Options
----------------------------------------------------------
I saw an ad on pinterest when looking up keto diets and decided to give it a try with the discounted subscription. I was super excited about the variety of meal plans it promised, but was disappointed to find out that the options are limited. I‚Äôm a fairly picky eater so I assumed finding recipes I liked would be difficult, but there were a total of 3 things that I would eat and could easily get the ingredients for. Even when searching for a recipe I made, there was nothing that popped up besides the few options on the explore page. If I want to make anything other than the recipes on the app itself I have to manually enter every single ingredient. I had purchased the 6 month plan but deleted it after 2 hours due to the lack of options and the overall inconvenience. Would not recommend going that route because now I spend $30 on nothing.

Title: Majorly contributed to my ed
----------------------------------------------------------
*TW ED* I used this app throughout my ed and I can say that it made it 100 times worse. I just got out of a 3 month long stay in inpatient and residential ed treatment at 15 years old and am still in a partial hospitalization program. This app lets you set ridiculously low calorie limits and doesn‚Äôt fight you on them with more than a notification that the goal is too low. In addition it sets your original goal at 1200 cal which isn‚Äôt even enough to feed a person in a coma. We need at least 1400 per day to exist in a coma and at least 2000 per day to exist a normal life. It encourages people to eat way under the amount their body needs. If you want to lose weight please do NOT use this app. Restricting your calories will not work long term. Listen to your body. It knows what it needs. You don‚Äôt want to end up where I and many others are.

Title: Not what I Paid For
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought the premium hoping for a multitude of recipes to swap in and out of meal plans and many options for various food preferences, this is not the case. There are very limited food plans and not a lot of offered recipes. Also it is very difficult to receive a refund if you are unsatisfied. I tried to cancel about 10 min after i purchases after I realized it did not include what was promised, and was directed to Apple Support who will not refund (Lifesum hides behind the fact that they do not directly handle the payment platform). I have tried to use it anyways since I‚Äôm paying for 6 months (whether I like it or not) and now the app keeps crashing randomly when I try to view the plan section. Disappointing, not worth it for premium, might be useful if you stick to free but my fitness pal is just as good with a larger database.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
We are awfully sorry for the inconvenience. Fact is that Apple does not give access to their payment data so any refund for any purchase can only be grated through Apple.

Title: Disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought this app because it boasted about having over 200 recipes and its many diet choices. I got the 1 year subscription and hoped it would work for me. So far it hasn‚Äôt. I am trying to go keto to lose some weight and I am also vegetarian (not vegan, so not that restrictive) and when I looked for recipes to fit the bill they only had maybe 10 available. Granted I can look up recipes but I was hoping for more ease with this app. They also don‚Äôt have a plan ahead feature which means if I want to plan a meal in advance I have to go through and add it to my daily count and try to delete it after. I disappointed to say the least, never have I felt compelled to leave a review but this app is a waste of money. Do NOT buy the subscription, you won‚Äôt get a refund if you don‚Äôt like the app and then you‚Äôll be out $40.

Title: Disappointing and Subpar
----------------------------------------------------------
I really wanted to like this app and even got a trial of the paid version. I liked the idea of the recipes and health scale. Quite frankly, it‚Äôs underwhelming and seems like it wants to be more like MyFitnessPal or Fitbit. However, its scanning function hardly works, and a lot of the information it does have is wrong or incomplete. It also does not track vitamins and minerals, which are really important, especially if you‚Äôre dieting. You also have limited control over what information you can input for a meal or recipe. I will say that I like the faces next to individual food items, but again, this is only effective if the information attached to the food item is correct. This app has a long way to go before it can be real competition for some of the other diet and nutrition apps out there.

Title: Annoying and limiting
----------------------------------------------------------
Is there not a way to add your own food? If I‚Äôve purchased something made by a keto bakery and have the macros, why can‚Äôt I add this food? The only self add I see is the simple calorie add. I was forced to purchase the app in order to use the keto strict plan, and now it‚Äôs limiting me in how I can use it. Also, i don‚Äôt always have a barcode for my food. Some eggs are naked in a bowl and have no carbs. But when I take a photo, they show up as .9 carbs. This is a big deal when you can only have 20 carbs a day. Another annoying thing: I don‚Äôt have time to enter an entire recipe for food or meal and allow the app to determine the macros. I have a good idea based on what I can read for myself. Why can‚Äôt I just input it myself when need be? It‚Äôs very limiting and frustrating to be this expensive.

Title: Terrible app
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is so frustrating to even try to use. I can‚Äôt believe I purchased the premium version based on other reviews, only to find out that it is so bad. The premium version has very limited functionality, and trying to enter real food is a battle that just isn‚Äôt worth fighting. It seems to think that all food comes from restaurants instead of my own kitchen. Too bad if you didn‚Äôt have a side of potatoes with that omelette. The app just decided that you did and you‚Äôre stuck with a food journal that isn‚Äôt representative of the actual food that you actually ate. And just try adjusting your macros to something you would want to track. The app pigeon holes you into one of a few predetermined meal plans and expects you to stick to that.  I am deleting the app even though I paid $30 for it.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
We are sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with our app and we thank you for your feedback. Besides being able to find single items (not paired restaurant-style) in our database, you also have the possibility to create your own items/recipes/meals through Me > Favorites and track EXACTLY what you are consuming. You also do not have to follow a meal plan or be stuck with the macros/calorie allowance the app has defined for you; you can instead choose the Classic plan and customise both macros and daily calorie goal. If you need assistance with finding these settings or with applying for a refund, please contact us through contact@lifesum.com and we will get back to you as soon as possible!

Title: WONT LET YOU UNSUBSCRIBE
----------------------------------------------------------
WHAT A NIGHTMARE!!!! I didn‚Äôt mean to sign up for a year. And when I followed the app‚Äôs link to unsubscribe, the developer only gives you the options to renew various packages. No way to unsubscribe or cancel!!! They also automatically auto renew at the end of user package you subscribe. So if you sign up for a month or a year, at the end of that period you will be automatically renewed and charged again. I tried to cancel through Apple but as this is a 3rd party developer, Apple doesn‚Äôt have the ability to do anything. And when I went to the Lifesum website and emailed customer support, I received an automated email about 3 days later informing me to follow the unsubscribe link through the app!!!! So basically the developer has locked you into a subscription with no way of canceling.

Title: Not worth it!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was very excited about this app because on top of being able to track my meals and work outs each day, it would provide me with suggested recipes. The catch is though, that in order to unlock all of the recipes, I had to upgrade to the gold version. BIG mistake! Logging anything is difficult. It's nearly impossible to get accurate food portions or even exercises for that matter.  There's some type of arbitrary grading system that makes no sense whatsoever. On top of that, I haven't gotten any new recipes! I can't believe I bought a year-long subscription to be told how to put avocado on toast everyday.  The most disappointing part is once I paid for my subscription, I'm stuck with it for the full term. There's no way to cancel it until it's over. Save your money!

Title: Great Weight Watchers Tracking App!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
After looking around extensively for an app to track my weight watchers points, I am very pleased with iShape.  Not only does it let you keep a calendar that tracks points and daily percentages for you (with some effort), it also allows you to search an online database and save submissions as favorites.  Then, you just need to add that favorite to your daily food list.  I also like the weight tracker with added charts to see how you have progressed.  It even lets you add exercise points, though adding the info yourself is sometimes necessary.  I have found that this app works great alongside the free iPoints app, which allows you to calculate points based on calories, fat and fiber.  Definately worth the money if you are serious about losing weight.

Title: Not worth premium
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought the premium version and it‚Äôs not worth it. I‚Äôll log an exercise and it‚Äôll be gone the next time I go in. I‚Äôll log my weight and then it‚Äôll be different next time. This happens on all sorts of areas, even my birthdate has changed on me, and I continually need to check back on things and correct. And it‚Äôs a little weird. It measures water intake by 8.45 ounces, and it‚Äôs hard to enter the exact the nutrition facts, like it‚Äôll recalculate my calories to be 59 rather than 60. Also, I can‚Äôt set my own nutrition goals or macros, I have to use one of their five preset plans. It‚Äôs just odd. Also, huge annoyance is that it doesn‚Äôt sync steps with Fitbit, only workouts! So I have to manually enter steps into Apple health. Just so frustrating.

Title: SO DISAPPOINTED!
----------------------------------------------------------
I paid premium for 1 year and regret it. So much of the information is inaccurate. The measurement and the nutritional data IS NOT ACCURATE. Even using the barcode scanner provides incorrect information. Very frustrating. I end up calculating everything myself and then trying to find a correct entry that is close which is a waste of time. Because of these issues I stopped using the app for the last few months and decided to try again, hoping it might have been corrected and updated. But it has not been fixed. I really do not understand how this app has high ratings. If you check the accuracy of the information you will see how ‚Äúoff‚Äù it is. Very Disappointed. Do not waste your money on this app. Verify for yourself using the free version. üôÅ

Title: Well, it's a good try.
----------------------------------------------------------
They layout and interface are beautiful, gave me hope for over all experience. But even with an upgraded plan I still wasn't able to adjust my macros, I was just given three choices. I like being able to set my own protein/fat/carb instead of having to choose what they give me and then having to figure it out on my own. The app also has a very limited database of food with the bar code scanner. It also does not sink with Fitbit/garmin. Also, some food is WAY off. For instance it told me that 4 large eggs had 135 carbs. Ummmm...escuse me? I didn't eat Cadbury eggs, just regular 'ol chicken eggs. That was more carbs than I was supposed to eat for the day. Since I KNEW that was WAY off it made me wonder about the rest of the food.

Title: Please change it back
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to be able to look up items by searching restaurant, brand name when I didn‚Äôt have a barcode to scan- and now everything is so general, how do I know I‚Äôm logging the correct thing if I don‚Äôt have the specific labels or brands. Example: I had an egg white grill sandwich from chic fil a this morning. I know this sandwich is 290 calories listed from the restaurant. I went to log it and multiple egg white grill food variations popped up all with very different calorie amounts and none that identified as chic fil or for 290 Cals. So I opted for the egg white grill that said 240 and I guess I‚Äôll adjust the serving to 1.21 to make it the equivalent of 290. I hope it‚Äôs the correct macros because idk if it‚Äôs even the right food

Hi there, thank you so much for your feedback. We have not made any changes in this area of the app lately, you should still be able to do this, however please note that these might be user added. If you know the calories yourself, you can easily add it to quick calories in the app.  Simply go to Diary > tap on the "+" on the meal you wish to add to e.g breakfast >then tap on the three dots in the top right corner > Add calories = here you can add the calories and name the meal you had. If you need any further assistance please let us know at contact@lifesum.com. Thank you!

Title: Some issues
----------------------------------------------------------
I got the app on recommendation of the google health app. I was looking for something that would sink easily with the data from the health app. I got the app and it showed I needed to go premium to be able to see everything. No problem, just a few bucks a month. Issue is now that I‚Äôve paid for the premium membership the app keeps telling me I need to upgrade, but when I go to upgrade it tells me I already have. I have tried signing out and signing back in and even deleting the app and then re downloading. Neither of these seemed to help. I have also reached out to the developer and not received any response. Seems like it would be a nice one stop app to monitor calorie intake and physical activity, if it would just work.

Title: Are you kidding???
----------------------------------------------------------
Give us your personal information, then pick a plan. Don‚Äôt worry, they don‚Äôt show you anything really on the basic plan. Literally you can look at some meals, and you get a free workout and meal diary... that is it. If you go with the premium you get recipes and tons of other perks. The dilemma for myself and so many others is that I have such a restricted diet I don‚Äôt know if your app allows all my preferences. I am not signing up for anything without knowing what EXACTLY I am getting in return. $30 to hope that you can provide the recipes I can actually eat??? Pass. This hopefully works for many who do not have serious restrictions but for those that do you are asking us to throw our money on a very unlikely bet.

Title: This app recommends STARVATION
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi, prospective doctor here. For people attempting to lose weight, this app recommends you undergo ‚Äútwo days of fasting‚Äù or the keto diet. Both of these options cut out sugar which is necessary for glycolysis, the metabolic pathway that fuels your body and synthesizes the ATP and Pyruvate that is used for Pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. All these processes keep your body alive and functioning. Eliminating glucose long term will lead to muscle deterioration and in severe cases, keto acidosis or self-canibalisation. Both are LIFE THREATENING. I suggest seeking a nutritionist who knows the bodily processes and not a trendy app that favors body image above health.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your concern. We believe that both 5:2 fasting and the ketogenic diet are low risk in the short term and indeed many users report success with these diets. We find the risks due to being overweight are far higher, which is why we include these diets in our recommendations. We would like more long-term research on both diets, but unfortunately these studies take time. We always attempt to offer the healthiest version of a diet that we believe is possible today. For individuals with health conditions, please consult your doctor before making large changes.

Title: Total waste of money
----------------------------------------------------------
I paid for premium in order to get access to the so called ‚Äúdiet plans.‚Äù What a waste of money. There are no actual meal plans associated with the selected diet plan, just a very brief explanation of what you should and shouldn‚Äôt eat. However, you can browse through the limited list of recipes that they have to build your own meal plans. That is tedious though because not all of the recommended recipes are appropriate for your selected diet plan. There is also a feature where you can select diet preferences and allergies. That doesn‚Äôt seem to inform any of the recommendations either as most of my recommended meals contained dairy of which I‚Äôm allergic to. This app was a total waste of time and money.

Something is so wrong. I updated to this version last night before I went to bed. Woke up this morning, and now my diet plan changed, all my ratings for the past few weeks were significantly lowered. I looked at updating my diet plan, and when I found what was most like my original plan, now it is rating nearly every day as an "A" when there is no way that the lasagna I ate a few days ago should be an "A" meal on an LCHF plan!? Plus many meals or food options are reading "(null)" next to them when before it would read how carbs. Also, I miss my meals telling me my carb goal rather than a calorie goal for the diet I'm on... My subscription is up soon, so I may cancel of this what I am left with.

Title: They steal your money
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought the app and used the regular version for a few weeks until I decided to upgrade to premium since it seemed to be worth it. It really was for about a month then I got a new phone and re-downloaded the app. Suddenly, not only was was I no longer able to connect to my premium membership, the app said my account no longer existed at all. So logically, I went down the ‚Äúreset username‚Äù and ‚Äúreset password‚Äù routes multiples times each, but the emails never arrived. I‚Äôve given up on the app. Biggest waste of money I have ever spent. The app was great until that, so beware they just steal your money then act like your account never even existed and ask you to sign up for premium all over again.

Title: Tedious
----------------------------------------------------------
The reviews were overwhelmingly positive so I thought why not and went for a 6-month subscription. Big mistake! One of the things that appealed to me when I previewed the app was the variety of plans. The downside was that it doesn‚Äôt explain the details of each forcing me to try and research each. After signing up I found that the meals did not appeal to me. I grew up on the Pacific Rim cuisine of Hawaii and I could not see preparing and eating the recipes included. Also it‚Äôs extremely difficult to enter food consumed. The inventory is not as comprehensive as another app that I am not naming. Expensive lesson learned as I am not going to be using this for most of the 6 months that I purchased.

Truly wish i didn‚Äôt go premium before the trial expired, wasted money and want a refund.  Too difficult to use, consistently reverts my weight back to previous weigh ins so while i‚Äôm progressively losing and NOT regaining weight the tracker looks like a yo yo, (i was at 158# last week and when i went to log my new weight is 157# today, the tracker had changed my weight to 162, has happened multiple times) lacks dietary preferences options, only very broad categories available to choose from like vegan, vegetarian and one other,  recipe ingredients in meal plan are complex and unrealistic, not enough dietary preferences and lacks meal plans for most dietary preferences.

Title: Promising based on it‚Äôs promises, but not in functionality
----------------------------------------------------------
I upgraded this app to the paid version based on the description of what is included. It does not deliver on the basic functions, so do not waste your money on the upgrade if you choose to try this app. It‚Äôs nearly impossible to personalize your goals since it works on a percentage system. If you want 60 grams protein, the fat and carbs are calculated for you based on the ‚Äútype‚Äù of diet that you selected. You can‚Äôt scale these yourself. I have also had difficulty getting it to use the calorie goal that I input. I have tried over 20 times and it just doesn‚Äôt work. It currently has me on a calorie goal of 1600 when I chose 2000 and selected my goal as high protein, maintain weight.

Title: Too many bugs for an app that I am paying for
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is a great concept. It's easy and user friendly, when it isn't crashing. It gets me to drink more and eat more vegetables and fish. However, it crashes multiple times a day for me. It will not allow me to input food for the next day, as it puts that food on the current day. It's so frustrating. Also, recently it is not correctly searching for food products that it has brought up in the past. I am very disappointed. With each bug fix, these problems get worse. In fact, ever since I started paying for it, I have had more issues than before paying. I will continue to use it since I paid for 3 months, but at this time I absolutely cannot recommend it.  Use any other app.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
The fix has just been launched. Please update your app and check if you are still experiencing any issues. Thank you very much!

Title: Don‚Äôt buy the premium subscription
----------------------------------------------------------
I used the free version and finally decided to upgrade to premium. They make you pay for the whole subscription (in my case I did one year) up front. This wouldn‚Äôt be a problem except my account STILL doesn‚Äôt show that I have the premium subscription even though I paid for it. It‚Äôs been three days and I‚Äôve sent emails and followed instructions from their ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù page. Also the premium Lifesum subscription isn‚Äôt eligible for a refund from the App Store. Don‚Äôt buy premium unless you feel like throwing $40 away without receiving what you paid for or hearing back from the company support. Very disappointing because I was so excited to unlock all the extra features.

Title: You are money greedy pieces of crap
----------------------------------------------------------
People aren‚Äôt made of money, everyone is low on money and I‚Äôd rather have something that doesn‚Äôt even work than pay you people that are trying to steal our money. I‚Äôm under 18 and my mom is obviously not going to pay for this crap, I don‚Äôt even get an allowance. I was hoping this would actually work but no, I just wanted to try a few of the things it suggested, but you just want money you greedy pigs. You have the IQ of chewed gum, and you look like a sewer rat that is slowly dying because it couldn‚Äôt find food and no one ever cared about it enough even to give it just a scrap of food. Everyone hates you. Edit: I can‚Äôt even pick a meal plan because you just want money.

Title: No custom macro targets
----------------------------------------------------------
I just got an Apple Watch and I was so excited to find this app since the one I currently use to track macros isn‚Äôt compatible with the watch. But as soon as I downloaded it and put in my info, I realized it doesn‚Äôt let me set my macro targets myself. What‚Äôs the point of this then?? The carbs were waaaay too high for me to lose weight and the protein was way too low. It‚Äôs not useful as is. I have to pay to go premium to get a bunch of features I‚Äôm not interested in just to be able to set custom macro targets? There‚Äôs not even a free trial to see if going premium is worth it, which every other app I‚Äôve seen has. This is very disappointing. Deleted the app immediately.

Title: Not worth it
----------------------------------------------------------
This app does not synchronize with your Fitbit or step counter. It doesn‚Äôt allow you to update nutritional information of foods that are missing such information on their database. It doesn‚Äôt give you a full report of your macro nutrients at the end of each day. It doesn‚Äôt allow you to see graphics of your macro nutrients. Long story short, all of these features that are missing are free on my fitness pal. I regret paying $50 to use this app when I could‚Äôve gotten all of this for freeWith my fitness pal. You do get recipes that are specific for your type of diet (vegan, keto, etc.) But you can find it for free extensively on the Internet. This app is not worth it.

Title: Accessibility Lacking for VoiceOver Users
----------------------------------------------------------
I love the promise Lifesum for iOS holds out; but since its developers consider requests by users who are blind to make the app accessible as feature requests to be voted upon according to overall popularity and awareness of the issue, I can't actually use the app The developers' attitude toward accessibility, seeing it as an additional feature that might be nice rather than an essential element of good design, means that the company loses customers because of its effectively discriminatory attitude, and that people like me, who rely on VoiceOver and accessibly designed apps, can't benefit from the promise of Lifesum's otherwise enlightened approach to wellness.

Title: Failure without support
----------------------------------------------------------
I eat healthy foods and my weight is healthy and stable after two kids. I eat almost all whole foods but have been cutting down on carbs to improve. I bought the premium membership to learn about macros. Almost every meal I log is classified as imbalanced including my breakfast today of kale, avocado, tomatoes, and eggs with coffee/table cream and coconut sugar. All meals are shown as too high in something but there is no way to click in and see where you went ‚Äúwrong‚Äù so there is no learning. The algorithms seem overly restrictive and are not designed to educate. The added sugar algorithm also does not show you where the too much sugar is coming into your diet.

Title: Could be better
----------------------------------------------------------
I loved using the free version enough to purchase it. Only then is when I realized that you can‚Äôt customize anything. I like the layout more than fitness pal and it‚Äôs all together a beautiful app, but for almost $50, you should be able you customize as much as you‚Äôd like. There‚Äôs a limit to how many new measurements you can add, you can‚Äôt adjust your macros, you can‚Äôt adjust your water, and there‚Äôs only a hand full of plans. If the app had the option to do all those things it would be the best tracking app out there I‚Äôd say. But it doesn‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt recommend spending your money on it. The paid version is just like the free version. You aren‚Äôt missing much.

Title: Waste of money
----------------------------------------------------------
I spent money for a 3 month subscription, and I honestly regret it. The app is beautiful, but I feel like that‚Äôs all it is. Trying to search for foods, even just basic ones, is like pulling teeth. I searched eggplant, and nothing came up. The meal plans themselves leave a lot to be desired, and honestly, seem a little bit sketchy to me. I also don‚Äôt like feeling like I‚Äôm being shamed for food that I eat with the little frowny faces or smiling ones. Especially when they‚Äôre not even necessarily accurate. Healthy foods that I‚Äôve eaten have been given an :|. I‚Äôll stick with My Fitness Pal. It might not be as pretty, but at the very least, it seems more accurate.

Title: Lacking in homemade foods.
----------------------------------------------------------
Lifesum does a pretty good job if everything you eat is from a known restaurant. The database for homemade foods in extremely lacking. You can always look up brand name foods but if you eat chicken breads with rice and broccoli good luck finding and accurate nutrient spread without adding it yourself. Really makes me angry because this is basic foods. I made a half pound Hamburger and salad and I can‚Äôt get a proper count, but a Big Mac or some obscure fast food is easily found. Honestly the only reason I‚Äôm using this app is because I made a mistake and purchased it because I thought I was choosing Lose It. Maybe check them out before paying for this one.

Title: Beautiful Interface Awful Frustrating Inaccuracy
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded this and another food tracking app.  Both offer free and premium subscriptions.  I was drawn to using Lifesum because the user interface is both attractive/fun and logging seemed easy and intuitive.  Unfortunately, that‚Äôs as much as Lifesum has going for it.  Even when scanning my food via barcode the calories, serving sizes, and other specific nutrition info is BLATANTLY WRONG.  I logged the same food on the other app the same way by scanning barcodes and everything came in correct.  I definitely won‚Äôt be getting a premium subscription with Lifesum when it‚Äôs free service can‚Äôt even log food accurately.  Don‚Äôt waste your time or money.

Title: Vegan propaganda
----------------------------------------------------------
I eat mostly animal products, because they have the most bio available and highest amounts of micronutrients compared to plant products. Protein too, because I want to be fit and plants are lower in protein by calories and amino score. Though this is basic knowledge, this app doesn‚Äôt allow you to specify you eat grass fed only and that all the meat you eat must be conventional low quality meat. Your health score is based off the amount of plants you eat and though I hit all my micronutrients almost everyday, I‚Äôm classified as ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù. Also, the biggest issue is the premium. It‚Äôs not monthly, so if you want to cancel, well there goes $40 to $80.

Not sure if it‚Äôs the current version, but the app isn‚Äôt working at all. The first time I downloaded it, it wouldn‚Äôt let me complete the meal preferences quiz. At the end of the questions it said connection error. Weird, I just downloaded the app in 2 seconds without issue. So okay maybe my connection. Then I go to set up my weight, etc and the screen keeps popping up the text bar when I need to click the next button. I never get that done.

I went to input my exercise for the day and when I tried to search the exercise , it wouldn‚Äôt load. I waited for about 10 minutes, exited out of the app and turned my wifi on and off.

Title: Nice design, poor features
----------------------------------------------------------
I originally gave this app three stars but after using it for a while, I have realized it is really worthless‚Äîeven after paying for a premium subscription, I find their competitor MyFitnessPal more useful. Most importantly you can't set your macronutrient goals, so if Lifesum thinks you should have 35% carbs there's nothing you can do about it. Also their product data base is much worse and less accurate than MyFitnessPal's. Lastly, it doesn't always make sense, like when each individual meal is under my protein target for that meal, yet I am over my protein target for the day. It's a shame such a nicely designed interface is going to waste.

Title: Unreliable app
----------------------------------------------------------
I switched to this app from my fitness pal because the UI is much better and seemed less buggy. However, after purchasing a 1 year subscription, I found that while the UI is better, the app has huge problems with properly recording your data. Whenever I input a meal it will not show up until I force quit the app and reopen. About once a day, all of my data will disappear and the only thing that brings it back is restarting the phone.  Activity tracking has just as many problems. When it stops working even a restart doesn't work. I have to turn activity tracking off in the app and then remove all syncing in HealthKit to get it to work again.

WELL, I would love to write a review of the actual app if I could. BUT, I couldn‚Äôt even get logged in to the app because I never got past the general information page, where they ask for age, height, current weight and goal weight. It kept telling me the ‚ÄúToo low BMI‚Äù when I put in my goal weight - even if I put the weight as 1 pound less than my current weight. Or if I put my current weight as 50 lbs heavier than I was. I tried several different weight combinations with no prevail to get past this page. I tried looking up this problem online and found no answer. Therefore, this app went straight to delete and I guess I‚Äôll try another one!

Title: Unless you opt for premium, this is not worth the time
----------------------------------------------------------
Found this through the Apple health app. Advertised as free. Answered 41 questions about eating and exercise habits. Was given calculations for goals. Then, to access recipes or suggested eating plans I will need to upgrade to premium. I‚Äôll stick to MFP which has all of the same free tracking options and does waste my time with pop up cartoon questions that require a premium membership for a generic evaluation or suggestions. . So be advised, know if you want any guidance through this app opt for premium or you will waste your time giving Lifesum personal info bec/ no help is given without a cost. There are plenty of other app available.

Title: Extremely unreliable food database
----------------------------------------------------------
The app is visually appealing and user friendly. But the food database is extremely is unreliable. Almost always, the database is different that what the label says on common packaged food. Many, many times the nutrition facts are correct, but the serving size is wrong. For example, the label on Organic Valley Cottage Cheese (4%) says 1/2 cup = 110 calories. But the Life Sum database says 1 cup = 110 calories. And, to make matters worse, there is an icon that says ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù. Clearly they are not verifying anything. Unless you are willing to manually enter your own nutrition facts for everything you eat, this app is pretty much unusable.

----------------------------------------------------------
Ever since last weekend the calorie count has been completely off. It appears that the Health app is syncing days from my Apple Watch and iPhone. There has to be a way to only count my Apple Watch the way MyFitnessPal does. I purchased the premium version of this app in October because I love having food plans. However ever since the update I'm frustrated that Lifesum is over-counting my calories and making it hard for me to leverage the great things about the app and making me do double the work by figuring out which exercise values I should be using. I would like to see a fix soon because I really do love this app when it works well.

My favorite is when the calories burned goes backwards. Now I'm suddenly allowed 700 extra calories in my diet? Nutritional information relies on individual input, which is often (read almost always) inaccurate. Not sure why sausage and egg on an English muffin has an "A" rating and a steak and lettuce wrap gets a "D." Also math is wrong - my breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack can each be 200 calories under individually and my overall calories will only be 200 under. This app is getting worse. Not reading calories burned from my tracking app. Walked the city yesterday and it says 3 calories burned. Customer support are boneheaded.

I started attempting to lose 15lbs about a week ago with help from Lifesum. I accidentally forgot to record my weight yesterday, and needed to update my weight today. For some reason, every time I put in my weight (only 1.5lbs lighter than the last time i updated it in app) the app gives me a notification saying they thought I typed the wrong numbers and wanted me to try again. I‚Äôm super frustrated as I obviously want to track my progress, but cannot. Is it because it thinks I lost weight too quickly? I‚Äôm pretty young and have had an active lifestyle my whole life, so losing 1.5lbs in ~2-3 days isn‚Äôt concerning to me.

This app was great at first, but after 3 days the step counter stopped linking up to my fitness app. After an hour working through the troubleshooting and another half hour to find the place in the app where one communicates directly with the designers, they insisted I send them screen shots of the relevant apps rather than simply believing that I had an issue. Then they told me, essentially, ‚ÄòToo bad, so sad, you‚Äôre SOL.‚Äô They don‚Äôt know how to fix the problem and don‚Äôt know when it will be fixed. And, no, they won‚Äôt refund what I paid.

Title: Constantly Promoting Premium DO NOT DOWNLOAD!
----------------------------------------------------------
So I got this app because I kept hearing great things about it, how easy it was to use, all the great recipes they offer, etc. Any time I tried to look at anything it would tell me to get premium. The app gave me a suggestion to look at certain recipes and then I would try to scroll and look and BAM ‚ÄúGet premium‚Äù would pop up again. It is incredibly frustrating and impossible to even use the app when I keep getting badgered to join premium. It seems like all this app is trying to do is take your money. I will be going back to using MyFitnessPal which is way more user friendly and not constantly pushing premium.

Sure, can you send us the recipt and your PayPal email..... üò† okkkk I‚Äôll send it again no problem, email is the same. After a MONTH...I‚Äôm sorry we can‚Äôt find your account. ü§Øü§¨

Title: Not sure what I paid for
----------------------------------------------------------
Upgraded to premium with the promise of meal planning and specialized diets. What the cost actually unlocked was a few specialized diets that largely were all comprised of the exact same meals. In addition the meal planning feature had a small handful of meals available with no real flexibility. For example - you can‚Äôt even block a day out. I downloaded today with the intention of shopping and starting at the end of the work week and yet I was required to have a meal selected and added to the shopping list for days I didn‚Äôt need. I also couldn‚Äôt rotate in other meal options - even ones found within the app.

Title: DO NOT GET FOR KETO
----------------------------------------------------------
I was hoping to use this for keto. They advertised keto recipes. When you buy it, you find out that there are not a lot of recipes that are keto compatible (less than 10g of carbs per meal). There are less than 20 recipes. They are still working on building their database for tracking macros, so it‚Äôs difficult if you are in the US to just find a meal that already has the macros. It‚Äôs also difficult to find very common foods and ethnic food. Yes it is pretty and the user interface is better than MyFitnesspal ‚Äî but I will take function over UI any day! You also have to at minimum get 3 months. Save your $20!

Title: Be careful when purchasing premium
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is very misleading when purchasing Premium. It gives you a break down of how much you would pay each month when purchasing multiple months. This leads you to believe you paying monthly and can choose to cancel at anytime if you choose. After receiving a $30 bill, I realized that you pay the total upfront and you are not billed monthly. When I reached out to the App Store, I was told the purchase is non-refundable. Even though I am now stuck with the app for a year, I doubt I will even try it now. I am disappointed that I was lead to believe I had the flexibility of cancelling if I chose to do so.

Title: If you‚Äôre counting carbs or care about accuracy at all, skip this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
TLDR: bought the premium app at 50 percent off since the user face is so beautiful (that‚Äôs my one star). If you‚Äôre looking for any sort of accuracy in the recorded nutritional content, you're best using a different app like My Fitness Plan, Senza, etc. So utterly disappointed that nearly every barcode scanned calculates the wrong information. I can accept some errors here and there since the data could be user submitted, but holy hell, how many things could be so far from what the nutritional content is for mainstream products like Fage yogurt cups. 17 carbs in 5 ounces of yogurt? Can your app even read?!

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your feedback. It‚Äôs a big challenge for us to allow people all across the world to track their everyday foods. Our users help by contributing missing foods to our database. Unfortunately, these contributions can have errors, as you discovered. We are constantly working to fix these errors, we hope you‚Äôll try us again in future.

Title: Be careful before you subscribe!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was recommended this app by someone and decided to try it out. I liked the interface and the kinds of tips they had to offer. Hadn‚Äôt been on the app longer than a few minutes before they were offering plans. Premium says it was only a few dollars a month for a wide variety of benefits. Thinking it was a month to month plan only to find out they outrightly charge you $50. They also don‚Äôt email you to let you know that you subscribed to it except for a receipt from Apple for an amount. Apple won‚Äôt process a refund either. $50 isn‚Äôt worth the basic features they give you for weight loss. Spend carefully.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
We appreciate your feedback! The reason we show the monthly cost, is for our users to see the difference in price from subscribing yearly and monthly. A monthly subscription is also available. We show you the total price before you pay. We are sorry if this wasn't clear enough. Please, send us a copy of your transaction receipt through contact@lifesum.com if you wish to be assisted with cancelling - thanks!

Title: Useful only if you pay
----------------------------------------------------------
Don‚Äôt get this app unless you‚Äôre willing to take cash out of your pocket just to get a suggested meal plan from a test. Some other person here wrote a similar review and I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I deleted the app right away and downloaded it again just to write this review because I don‚Äôt recommend it unless you really want to pay for it. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre gonna get many people wanna download this app if you‚Äôre asking for them to pay for something for a suggested meal plan. You‚Äôre better of getting more people to want to use your app if you earn money through ads because this just seems like a rip off.

Title: Change of heart
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using the premium version of this app for almost a year. I loved the interface and how easy it was to use. I also enjoy the ability to connect my exercise and my scale so that I don‚Äôt have to manually enter those things in the app every time. As of late the app has been very glitchy! It logged a weight for me incorrectly and I can‚Äôt figure out how to remove it. I was missing the updated plans and only had the option of 4 plans. Like other users have stated the food log database is way off and the scanner will not work sometimes just keeps scrolling. Back on the hunt for something better!

Title: Very unsatisfied
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought the app on 8/26 and was quickly prompted to get the Premium upgrade. I unfortunately decided to do the year because it said $3.99 a month well it charged me the whole this.... 1st strike. Then I realized that I really didn‚Äôt need the extra stuff as there are support groups and Pinterest for Keto recipes and decided to unsubscribe from the Premium before the 14 days were up. I have reached out on the App several times and no response I have emailed only to get an automated letter saying they will get back to me. Beware don‚Äôt do the Premium Upgrade you can find the recipes free on Pinterest

Title: Do not pay for this app.
----------------------------------------------------------
Not worth the money at all. The # of recipes is laughable and you're better off just using Yummly. The meal and day rating system is generic (not tailored to the plan you're on as is implied during the sales pitch, very vague and not helpful). The scan barcode feature to register food items almost never has the food items in the system and in the rare event it does the nutritional facts are always wrong. I have to spend a ridiculous amount of time manually inputting the nutritional facts for each ingredient I use. Basically, you are paying to build up the database for them. Very unhappy customer.

Title: Good app, terrible support.
----------------------------------------------------------
I ran into an issue where I had an empty account attached to my email and was trying to attach that email to the app to avoid losing the data I had already logged. When I emailed support about the issue, making it clear that I wanted to avoid losing the data in the app, they responded a day later telling me to logout of the app, which would erase the data. When I responded stating that was exactly what I wanted to avoid and asked them to delete the account attached to the email they never replied back. If you‚Äôre worried about ever needing tech support, avoid this app and look for another option.

Title: Seems to be ok
----------------------------------------------------------
I have struggled with my weight all my life. Got up to 410lbs. Trying to loose weight has really taught me something. It is cheaper to be fat than to loose weight. This app proves that. $44 a year. Every app cost a fortune. Add to that the cost of eating healthy, which is much more expensive than eating junk food. No wonder so many people die fat. Waiting for the day when it is cheaper to eat healthy and to loose weight. Until then, guess I need to look for another app to help me.Edit: Fitbit sync fir free would really be nice. But your response shows you have no desire to help, only make money.

Title: Team MyFitnessPal
----------------------------------------------------------
I got a bit carried away with the aesthetics of Lifesum and purchased the premium version without much thought, I was quickly disappointed. I would scan in my everyday food items and the nutrition facts were off by a lot on about everything, taking the time to edit each item of food was enormously inconvenient! I‚Äôve used MyFitnessPal since 2013 and I‚Äôve never had any issues with it! It‚Äôs way easier to use and most importantly it is actually accurate which is the entire point of counting calories and macros. I‚Äôm currently waiting on my refund from Lifesum and will be back on MyFitnessPal ASAP!

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
We are sorry to hear that Lifesum didn't meet your expectations and we thank you for your feedback. Our food database is partly user-created and that results in some items having inaccurate nutritional values. It's recommended that you either select items verified by us or, for items that you cannot find in our database, create custom items under Favorites.

Title: Says its vegan/allergen friendly but its really not
----------------------------------------------------------
Has no diet plans for vegans or vegetarians. Fighting to get my money back now. What a disappointment. I can see how this would be useful for people who eat meat, though‚Äîotherwise, not many choices or options to choose from, and not as customizable as advertised. However, the calculator for the macros isn't beneficial and doesn't guide you through what the proper % balance would be for your goals. It presets it but not to what would be accurate for what your goals are. The app isn't exceptionally user friendly all in all. Great concept of an app, though; just needs a lot of work.

Title: Total calories 30% off, big bad bug
----------------------------------------------------------
I used it for 2 days. The second day, when i added 350 calories for breakfast, the app showed the total as 570.  I used my fitness in conjunction, and it correct. I double checked each entry. Uninstalled app. Useless if the calorie count add another 30% error to the errors we already get from processed and restaurant food.  This was while using it on the iPhone.  Then I checked the sync on the iPad app. It showed the correct calorie count. Looks like a bug. A big one. Also the iPad app does not go to landscape mode. Unusable on a 12" iPad Pro if I can't see it in landscape mode.

This app looks amazing... and that‚Äôs about it. They don‚Äôt tell you until you‚Äôve already created an account and given them your information that nearly every feature of the app is locked behind a premium subscription pay-wall.

Title: So pretty, but adding food is an exercise in frustration!!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Whats the point of this app if after adding food, it 1) tells me the food is already added and erases my own inputs of items. Then, when I go to scan barcode, or search for the food, the food item does not show up on the list!!! 2) after successful food entry, I go to the webpage and the numbers dont match up?? For example, I go and add some Russell Stover‚Äôs sugar free candies, and instead of the calories reading 210 for 3 pieces, the total shows 99 calories/3 pieces, and all my macros show as decimals?? I added several foods and NONE of the values on the website was right.

This app may be beautifully designed and user friendly compared to their competitors out there. That‚Äôs what drew me in, but it is the glitchiest thing on earth. I‚Äôm a customer who recently upgraded to premium in order to fully access all the features of the app. I recently noticed that this app always disconnects from my smart watch, reboots the calories, and provides macros of 0 carbs, 6% protein, and 0 fats. Wouldn‚Äôt you be in awe when you are trying to log your calories, open the app and all of a sudden only be allowed to consume 6 calories?  I‚Äôm not on a water fast...

I was struggling with my weight for a long time until a friend recommended this app and I was at 165lbs before downloading this app. But after I downloaded this app and let it control the amount of calories I intake during my day I didn‚Äôt lose but I gained 4 pounds instead. Please fix whatever problem caused this. It took me only 4 days to gain 4 pounds and now imagine how long it will take me to lose those 4 pounds and get back on track??

Title: Very little recipes and menu options
----------------------------------------------------------
Was very excited to try the Keto Burn Plan option, after making a 3 months purchase I saw the plan and was surprised to see only few menu options to choose from, only around 8 dishes to choose from for each meal. This is not worth the monthly commitment. If I were only looking to track my macros many apps does it completely free, really only signed up for the menu planning but with such few choices it is worth paying for the app. I also reached out to the Contact us and no response after 4 full days after multiple efforts on my side to reach out.

I thought this app was great at first since it pairs really nicely with my Apple Watch and all the meal plan options! My biggest and really only complaint is that the foods are inaccurate!! Like very very wrong! I would have to enter all the specs from every food myself for the accuracies which honestly defeats the purpose of entering! I have used my fitness pal for years and it was WAYY more reliable. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt pair with my Apple Watch, but I would take accuracy over luxury any day for my health!! I want a refund for this. Waste of money for premium.

This app seemed very nice and very simple to use. It looked like a great tool to start helping me try and become healthier all around. I created an account knowing that there were parts that required payment to use, but I assumed that still meant I could use most of the features. I was wrong. With not spending any money, I couldn't do very much or track very much. I didn't even keep the app for very long because almost everything I clicked on was something I had to pay for. I'm a college student that can't afford to spend any extra money. Overall a disappointment.

Title: Not suitable for most Americans- European App
----------------------------------------------------------
They do not have any tool to convert measurements to the imperial system within recipes and meal plans. I have to use an additional app every time I use a recipe, write down the conversion for each ingredient. I also have to use the conversion app when entering my meals. It really makes me avoid using their built-in meal plans which would otherwise be great. However because of this issue, this is basically a calorie calculator (they have many of these available on the App Store that have imperial measuring system). If this was changed I would really like the app.

Title: garbage
----------------------------------------------------------
This app doesn‚Äôt deserve a single star. MyFitnessPal‚Äôs free version is way better than this garbage. Lifesum doesn‚Äôt update your weight when you update it on apple health. There‚Äôs no way to customize your food diary meals setting (I like whole day instead of worrying about each meal and ONE snack) or customize the micronutrients. Why did I pay for this again?! The premium for MyFitnessPal allows you to customize so much more, even MyFitnessPal‚Äôs free version is more customizable. I want a refund. I used this app for a total of maybe four days. I hate the UI.

Paid full price for the old app. Never updated it. Liked it a lot. The new app is garbage. Most of the functions now require you to buy a ShapeUp Club Gold monthly subscription account or go to their website for their "online food database, containing 400,000+ foods." Umm, I think that defeats the purpose of buying an "app". If I wanted to go to my computer & browse the web, why would I pay you a subscription to be limited to just you site?...because it syncs to your app? Just purchased LiveStrong app. Hmmm seems you can search right from the app...genius!

Title: Clumsy, incomplete, not intuitive.
----------------------------------------------------------
Trying this out for the first time with my daughter for our New Year‚Äôs resolution.  The user interface is awkward.  Features are not logically arranged to make entering data convenient.  The bar code scanner does not work most of the time.  The developers leave it to the user to enter food and create their data base so you see the same food entered 20 different ways.  The button layout should walk the user through the process of using the App. Instead you spend a LOT of time back tracking.  It‚Äôs a total mess...but hey, it‚Äôs free. You get what you pay for!
