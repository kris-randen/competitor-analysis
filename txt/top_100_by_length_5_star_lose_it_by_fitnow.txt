Title: Easy way to own your choices!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Tracking food and fitness has been the tools I‚Äôve used to lose 50 pounds and achieve a healthy BMI!  I have tried several different methods of tracking over the past 40 months. I also have experienced tracking ‚Äúpoints‚Äù many years ago. I am convicted that tracking feels like freedom to a healthy lifestyle. I discovered the Lose It app via word of mouth 3 months ago and was looking for a change from a previous app that was not providing real time data between my calorie burn and my calorie intake. Also I wanted an app that allowed me to add a picture of food to track later if I was in public or at someone else‚Äôs house eating. I wanted to pursue the next level of tracking and remove the last layer of fat if you will to achieve my ideal body and health at the age of 44. I purchased the year subscription and got started. I began by loading one week of my previous tracking data from my old app and started tracking on the Lose It app. I found the Lose It app to be so much easier and user friendly than any of my previous tracking methods I‚Äôve tried. I found it took seconds to add my meal and it is so easy to adjust the portion size based on my food scale measurements. The recipe builder is easy to use and easy to modify for meals created from scratch. I was so excited about the the ease of use, the real time data between my Apple I Watch, my calorie burn, the graphs, stats, badges, and tools of encouragement that I made a commitment to myself that this was going to be my lifestyle. I decided to commit to my health and purchased the Lifetime subscription. I am convinced that health is earned through day to day choices. It is easy to be influenced by others, the culture, events, situations, stress and all the other outside factors that can make health feel so challenging. At the end of the day the Lose It app does an incredible job giving the power of making choices and taking self responsibility for those choices easy and fun! I highly recommend Lose It app. Lose it has helped me lose that last ‚Äúhard‚Äù 10 pounds in only 80 days of consistent tracking.

Title: Way better than other apps
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is amazing even using the free version, and the fee for premium is far less than other apps. It‚Äôs basically the cost of going out to dinner once or twice, for an entire year. USE THE PREMIUM. I didn‚Äôt think it would be worth the functionality, but bought it anyway to support the app since I‚Äôm getting so much use out of it. The premium functions will reveal key information to you. For example, my highest contributor to saturated fat by far was an occasional slice of reduced fat swiss cheese (yikes lol). I was getting way too much sodium from using tuna as a regular protein source. Baby carrots are my best source of fiber, by far better than any whole grain items lol. I thought mini candy canes were no big deal occasionally because of the low calories, but they managed to top the list for simple carbs...and I didn‚Äôt even eat very many of them! It‚Äôs amazing to see this charted out for you, and allows for simple changes to what you‚Äôre eating for big gains to your health. The free version of the app is great as well, extremely easy to use, nice clean uncluttered interface, and easy to chart your calories and macronutrients. Tells you how many calories you have left for the day. Easy to re-enter foods that you eat a lot, since they will pop up at the top of the list in the same quantity as last time (but you can adjust quantity quickly as well). Doesn‚Äôt constantly give you annoying pop-ups recommending premium upgrade like some other apps. I definitely recommend using this, it‚Äôs really worth the small amount of time it takes to enter the foods you‚Äôre eating. You might think you know everything about your diet, but you‚Äôll probably find some new info using this app.

Title: Great!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using Lose It! for about 3 weeks now and have already lost about 6 pounds. The idea of just having to scan a barcode is super easy and it‚Äôs hard to forget to log your meal because you always gotta eat! Plus, being a student on the go all of the time and having sports makes it difficult to actually use workout apps but this app is so simple and easy to use. And, if you‚Äôre in a hurry and couldn‚Äôt log a meal the day before you can always go back and edit your past days if you left something out and it will still process the info. One thing to be careful of however is not eating. There was one time where I knew I was going out and knew I was going to be over my calories and was tempted to skip breakfast but skipping meals is not a good thing to do!!! It‚Äôs okay to be over your calorie budget a little, never feel inclined to always meet the goal. Having this app made me realize what I was putting into my body(I have the free version but it still displays macros which is super helpful.) This app combined with the app ActivityTracker is the perfect duo! Enter in the distance you walked at the end of the day from ActivityTracker on Lose It! and you‚Äôll get calories added onto your calorie budget! I DEFINITELY recommend this app as I recommend it to all of my friends and anyone I know who is looking to lose weight and I hope you become as satisfied with Lose It! as I am! :)

Title: WoW! I am a happy Loser! Are You?
----------------------------------------------------------
Best app I ever used for steady weight loss!!!... it‚Äôs very encouraging to see that even when I feel like I dropped the ball and had a bad day, as far as having eaten to much, that the app doesn‚Äôt give up on me but rather motivates me to keep going and not give up on myself! This App TRULY gives me hope and a practical game plan daily. It divides my calories up per meal (4 meals) and suggest the allotted calories it recommends.... and hey! I know this thing is just an app/calculator but if you let it it can be so much more. Lastly, this app Allows you to take pics of your food daily/each meal, scan bar codes (way easier logging on the run and jetting out the door!). It‚Äôs not crazy complicated either. I love it! Honestly, when I can afford premium I am all about it!!! It teases you a bit and gives you examples of premium App privileges but it‚Äôs not to pushy either. From what I can see, premium offers dietitian planned meal plans, recipes, GROCERY LISTS & SUGGESTIONS ON WHERE TO SHOP!!! (Yes!!!... so much easier while raising a family) Ok, so enough said! This app speaks for itself. Try it! Work It! Love it! & Lose it! P.S. if I created this App I would have called it My Body Accountant or My Personal Body Life Coach! or how about My Bestie? üòÑ (seri doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to this app) ....That is how good it is! üëçüèªüòäüçáü•ÇCheers!!!...all ya happy Losers out there üòú (lol)

Title: Best app ever!
----------------------------------------------------------
My weight was stuck and I actually gained. I finally decided to really do something about my weight and couldn‚Äôt find out why I couldn‚Äôt lose any weight when I didn‚Äôt eat all that bad. This app helped me figure out where my problem areas were and that was sugar and sugary drinks. I‚Äôve now changed up my diet a bit, watched my portions w this app yet this app STILL allows me to eat what I love and enjoy my sugar on certain days/times and STILL lose the weight. So far, I‚Äôve only been on it 17 days and have lost almost 4 pounds. It helps me more plan my meals and workouts in order to get the best results so that in itself motivates me! Also want to add that when the app sends badges on the screen when I lost weight or logged another day - that motivates me to keep going! Its like I‚Äôm competing against someone and being congratulated for my weight loss, but really I‚Äôm only competing against myself and I LOVE that! I am also using the free app right now! I‚Äôll be back to update when I get to my goal in July!  I am so happy it‚Äôs working I can‚Äôt believe it. This app saved me!!! Don‚Äôt need no weight watchers or crummy fad diets. I‚Äôm still eating what I love yet being mindful and careful. And cutting back on the sugar. Thanks loseit!!!

Title: Attention all diabetics 2
----------------------------------------------------------
Best possible way to log, to pay attention, and to show graphs of your successive approximation to lowering your A1c. You are capable of logging everything that goes in your mouth henceforth you are given calories and carbs, what could be better or easier for us. Some of us are even sedentary this gives us the capability to see Day by day as we journal our activity, maybe not at the Fitbit or the gym, our every day lives. I have sustained accountability and credibility with ourselves for everything absolutely everything that goes into this mouth. Socially you can have very very close friends that you talk to daily just as one does on Facebook but it‚Äôs all relevancy to keeping healthy yes healthy. Losing weight is just a secondary benefit which is obviously for many of us important however if we cut out the carbs alone the weight will fall off and we will lose it yes Loseit. A wonderful wonderful program, unfortunately I see it putting many nutritionist  out of business.. Love love Loseit and all it has to offer especially in the premium package, try it speaks for itself for us diabetics who need to control our quantity and our quality of our foods. We will become healthier yes healthier what could be better.üôè

Title: I never thought I‚Äôd say this about a calorie tracker but...
----------------------------------------------------------
This is one of the best apps I‚Äôve ever found. It‚Äôs one of the easiest to use calorie tracker apps I‚Äôve ever tried (and the only one I‚Äôve been able to stick to using!). I use the free version, and even though I can‚Äôt track my macros or water (you need premium for that), it is so easy to see what I‚Äôm really eating compared to what my goals are. For the first few days, i didnt try to limit myself at all, just ate what i would normally eat in the amounts i would normally have and saw just how much i was eating compared to what it said i should be for my goals (i was eating about an extra 400 cals a day) and then slowly lowered my calories per day to what the app suggested for my goals. It even lets you know if it finds patterns in what you‚Äôre eating that are helpful to your goals (it pointed out that on days i eat chicken, i eat fewer calories overall). It‚Äôs super user friendly, and you can either look up brands of your foods or use the barcode scanner to find them more quickly. Only issue I‚Äôve found is that sometimes it measures portions in different amounts than the box says (like I‚Äôll say I‚Äôm eating mac and cheese and it‚Äôll ask me how many grams of food instead of cups or w/e). Overall, highly recommended!

Title: 11 Years of Usage
----------------------------------------------------------
I first downloaded this app in 2009 on my iPhone 3G. I‚Äôve used it nearly every day since. From the start it‚Äôs been the perfect, no-nonsense app for tracking calories and macronutrients. With it I have learned all about nutrition and I‚Äôve developed insights into my eating habits, strengths and weaknesses. I‚Äôve seen each feature rollout improve the app‚Äôs user experience, from viewing info for individual meals to adding future meals, creating accounts for use across multiple devices to searching a public food database, scanning barcodes for quick entry to setting goals for macros and body measurements in addition to weight and calories. I‚Äôve used it to lose, gain, and maintain my weight. My graph goes all the way back to 2011 (lost some data from that iPhone 3G before online accounts started). I use the browser application frequently when I‚Äôm on a computer, and I‚Äôve used the app for years alongside old Nike+ shoe trackers, Fitbits, bluetooth scales and now my Apple Watch. As a software engineer I even pull the data it syncs to Apple Health for use in my own web application of custom charts for myself. This app has been heavily influential on my life and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.

Title: All you need
----------------------------------------------------------
I am coming up on my one year anniversary of using this app. That‚Äôs right folks, I have logged my food intake every day for a year. I wasn‚Äôt technically overweight but I was at the very top end of healthy for my height and not feeling my best. I am now, after losing 40 pounds, at the low end of what is a healthy weight for my height (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù so the range is large). I lost the weight on an exponential curve, quickly at first and then slowing to where I sit currently. I‚Äôve tried exercise to lose weight and I almost always have eaten relatively healthy, but portion control and snacking were real problems for me. Tracking through this app helps me stay accountable, see what‚Äôs a healthy portion, plan, and stay on track. With all the hype with other weight loss programs out there, this quietly gives you all you really need. Finally, yes, I pay for the premium subscription and the price is far less than any other weight loss program out there. It also makes the program sync with my Fitbit. I never write reviews for apps but this one deserves it. Just do what it says and the results will follow. If you don‚Äôt get results, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs almost certain that the problem is in the mirror.

Title: Quick, easy accountability
----------------------------------------------------------
Have no idea how much you‚Äôre eating during the day, or why‚Äîin spite of regular exercise‚Äîyou‚Äôre not losing weight? Lose It! is a quick and easy-to-use app that simplifies calorie tracking and gives you an accurate picture of where all those empty calories are hiding in your diet. The key to success is your honesty‚Äîif you eat a few Hershey kisses, log it. If you sample a few shreds of cheese while you‚Äôre cooking, log it. If you order a venti mocha with half n half, log it accurately (by the way, that is probably all your calories for the day and you get to eat celery for dinner). For me, it‚Äôs eye-opening to know how many extra calories there are in sweeteners like honey, brown sugar, jam, ketchup, bbq sauce that do nothing to fill me up and leave me hungrier sooner. But it‚Äôs worth it to use high-protein, high fat condiments like peanut butter and real butter on your whole wheat toast or sweet potato because they leave you fuller longer. All that said, this tool will be as helpful for kicking off a healthy lifestyle as you are honest with your tracking. So be honest‚Äîdon‚Äôt freak out when you go over by 50 calories on a low exercise day. Make it up tomorrow. And happy losing!!

Title: Useful for someone terrible at being consistent
----------------------------------------------------------
In the past I‚Äôve always had trouble being consistent with working out, eating right, etc. Being in NYC  especially, going out and drinking we‚Äôre constantly curtailed. With the pandemic however, I made it a goal to be more healthy. With the extra time at home, I cook a lot more and have the time to add into the app. It‚Äôs fun for me now, and compared to myfitnesspal (I had trouble sticking to it), I find this more simple, UI/UX is super clean and it really gives me insight into what I‚Äôm eating and how /when I overreat based on how many calories I‚Äôm eating at breakfast/the amount of fats/and more. I‚Äôve told all my friends to get this and I‚Äôm surprised by the diversity of the foods listed as well. My only note would be to add a feature where you can see what times you are eating Your meals because I noticed that when I ate the appropriate(according to my analysis) calories at breakfast but had my lunch at a later time I would overeat, so it would be helpful to keep track of time as well. What you don‚Äôt track doesn‚Äôt get measured and it‚Äôs slowly changing my other habits and hopefully to become more productive and work out more. It‚Äôs my favorite app!

Title: Best I‚Äôve tried
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve always known that, for me, the best way to get my eating in check was to record everything I ate. But my daily charts were cluttered and hard to assess for patterns or pitfalls. This app makes it so easy to do so much more than the basic record. I can see exactly where I am at any moment and can easily change portion sizes to better reflect what I actually ate. I can see what patterns of eating work best for me ‚Äî who‚Äôda thought that drinking a beer now and then tended to reduce how much I eat? A nice graph tells me how many days before I reach my ideal weight if I continue what I‚Äôm doing‚Äî talk about great motivation! And though I think it‚Äôs kind of silly, they even give me virtual badges for my accomplishments. And the food search list is pretty darn complete, but you can just add a random caloric intake in the rare event you can‚Äôt find what you were searching for. My favorite feature is how easy it is to revise a recipe or a food item to better reflect what you ended up eating. If a recipe really ends up making three portions instead of four, it‚Äôs easy to change that‚Äî and all the fat, carb and caloric info automatically adjusts. Cool!

Title: Could NOT be more pleased
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve used Lose It for two years, and am a HUGE fan. When I first started using it, I quickly learned how easy it was to keep track of my food intake. The app gave me a daily target...based on my weight, height, target weight, etc. Entering anything into the daily dairy is crazy easy. I especially like that the database seems to include everything from practically any restaurant. I can type (or dictate), ‚ÄúLogan‚Äôs Roadhouse Caesar salad‚Äù, and it pops up on the list. You can enter your entire meal in five seconds. After using the app for a couple of months, I was blown away by my weight loss. Keeping track..like this...makes you cognizant of what you are eating...aware. I found that I was easily staying beneath my goal. The weight dropped off..and it was effortless. Just...awareness. The App also allows you to enter Exercise. That caused me to be aware and accountable to myself. I found that I rarely missed my exercise...because I loved getting it done...so I could enter it in the App. To me...this is a breakthrough in healthy eating...weight loss (for those desiring to drop some weight), and am awareness if a healthy lifestyle. I love it.

Title: Bang for your buck
----------------------------------------------------------
I don‚Äôt normally write reviews ever. However this app is LIFE CHANGING. If you want to get serious  look no further. After purchasing premium for two years I decided to take the leap and buy the lifetime membership. Here‚Äôs why: community- you make amazing friends who are all going at it with you and inspire to keep you on track. Recipes and guides for workouts at your fingertips to keep things interesting. Challenges to keep you competitive and motivated to continue habits. An easy to use interface (I prefer it over myfitnesspal) it‚Äôs highly customizable and gives me many goals to target. There is literally nothing they haven‚Äôt thought of to keep you on track. The only time I lose weight is when I stick to it and log my food. There is so many amazing features it really makes the app a step above the rest. I‚Äôve been using it (off and on admittedly I‚Äôm not perfect on my journey to health) for 3 years now and every time I focus on the app and remaining active I lose so much more comparatively. They give you all the tools you need  and wrap it up in a neat package and you step up with your motivation and time and it will truly pay off.

Title: I just wanna cry! I love this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I found out about this app by word of mouth from my massage therapist, and also from a lady at my church so I said man I‚Äôve heard so many good things it must be good so I tried it, at first it was a struggle to keep under my limit but after the first week or so it got easier and easier, in just 4 weeks I lost 15lbs!!! That‚Äôs amazing I couldn‚Äôt have done it without this app, I absolutely love love love it! I will stick with this app till I get to my goal and even after!!! I also didn‚Äôt realize how much stuff is unhealthy until I had this app too, now when I go to Costco I see something that looks good, first thing I do look at the back to see the calorie count and if it‚Äôs something like 400+ calories I‚Äôm like nope, and I put it back down lol, I‚Äôve also cleaned out my whole kitchen and replaced with all healthy stuff! I just have so much to say about this app I love it! If your considering loosing weight and it‚Äôs a struggle to do it yourself which I‚Äôve went that route and didn‚Äôt loose a pound but with this app if you stick with it you can do it I have faith you can! So good luck with your weight loss story!

Title: I LOVE THIS APP!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is one of my favorite apps of all time, and trust me I have tried A LOT of apps! In my quest to win the battle of the bulge, this has been one of the best apps I have come across to help me manage all aspects of what I am looking to do. It is so easy to log information, to find information, and to make goals for myself that keep me motivated to keep trying. The annual fee for premium service is well worth every single penny. I also just discovered that I can also use the app to track recipes from the cookbooks that I have which is also tremendously helpful in tracking yet again. I have not found the snap it option to be especially helpful, but I do try it once in a while for the heck of it. I also use the app to email automatically to my physicians office by weekly logs which helps keep me accountable to doing the logs and keeping track of what I‚Äôm eating so that helps immensely too. However there are so many features to this app that makes it easy to help you reach your goals that I could not possibly recommend it higher! Congrats to the development team on a successful and helpful product!

Title: The struggle is real
----------------------------------------------------------
All my life I was able to maintain a very healthy tone body. Dieting was never in the equation, until I went through a major medical crisis. During that time I gained 36 pounds in one year, and the weight just kept piling on. So, over the next 7 years my weight bloomed up by 60 pounds. I was considered healthy over all ... except my weight. I was obese!!! I tried diets, unlimited diets, and the cost of diet drinks and pills didn‚Äôt help, each one I failed at. The weight would not come off, until I found the Lose it app. I bought a scale, terrifying as that was. I tracked each and every bite that went into my mouth. I was amazed at how simple it was to lose track of calories consumed and portions, until I took control with the Lose it app. My goal is 2 pounds a week. And today I‚Äôm down 10 pounds. Yay! The best part, I do not deprive myself from eating what I want. I just track each and every bite. It‚Äôs that simple. Plus, I track my steps. The nutritional value of my food as well as carbs, fats and proteins. And, I love the scanner so I always know the portion and calories. Thank you, Lose it!!!

Title: It's amazing
----------------------------------------------------------
I use the free version. I recommend it to all my friends and strangers who ask about losing weight. I downloaded loseit in 2013. I had visited china the previous year and weighed 270. I was embarrassed being the 'fat america' I was only 22 years old. I wanted to go back to china but I wanted to feel comfortable in my skin there. It's so easy being obese in America because it's not uncommon. Going to china was a slap in the face for me. I was worried about being hungry all the time. 1200 calorie diets didn't seem to be enough. Loseit started me at 1700 calories so I didn't starve during the day but I still lost weight. I was shocked to see how many calories I had been eating a day before I started tracking. August 2014, weighing 180 I got on a plane to china again. I went from a size 24 to 12. I got down to 155 at my lowest so far. I had my daughter last year and gained weight after my c-section from not being able to walk for a month and just being in pain six months. So I'm using loseit again to get back on track. I can't recommend it enough. It saved me.

Title: Weight Loss Made Simple!
----------------------------------------------------------
My whole family is on WW so I jumped on board. However, I quickly discovered that WW does not work for people who are whole food plant based because of their ridiculous zero point food list. Almost all fruits and veggies are on it, but so are beans, which are super high in calories! Beans and legumes are one of the healthiest things we can put in our bodies. Anyway, I started assigning points (1 per 60 calories) to beans and I started losing weight. Then I realized I was PAYING WW and having to do their job for them! I did a bunch of research and found Lose It! and it has been amazing. Two months now and so easy to use! Same bar scanner and food database tools as WW, same ability to add my own recipes (a must for WFPB people), and even does a better job of tracking weight, exercise and patterns! I love this app so much. Weight loss is about calories. Period. Counting calories used to be a pain but this app makes it so easy and even fun while helping you learn how to eat healthy for a lifetime. Two big thumbs up! Why are people paying for WW?!

Title: The Only App to Actually Help Me Lose Weight
----------------------------------------------------------
I got this app kinda on a whim after seeing it mentioned in a Reddit thread. I‚Äôve always been overweight/obese and at my heaviest was 265lbs. After discovering exercise in high school I managed to whittle my weight down to 185lbs. However exercise is only one part of weight loss/a healthy life style. I never learned how to count calories, estimate how many calories were in food, or even how to tell how MUCH food to eat! So slowly I gained weight back until I was about 220lbs and knowing how small I had been I was very depressed. Getting this app (the free version) and actually staying true to logging calories, and I mean EVERYTHING you eat, has helped me lose 15lbs in two and a half weeks alone. I can‚Äôt wait to see how much further I can go. To be successful with this app though, you can lie to yourself. Don‚Äôt fake the numbers or omit things from your log just to make it look better, you‚Äôre the only one who suffers by doing that. Log everything and learn what it is to eat a healthy amount of food each day and you‚Äôll lose weight in no time.

Title: Great tool
----------------------------------------------------------
I recently moved over from using MyFitnessPal, to me the UI is just not friendly. On top of that got tired of getting marketing emails, even after asking to be removed from their list on several occasions. Went ahead bit the bullet and moved to the premium subscription, figured it would entice me to stay on track. Lose-it is easy when it comes to inputting data with a pretty good database. The insights section has already helped me to see trends that have helped me adjust my daily intake of sodium, carbs and fat. It‚Äôs fairly easy to create your own recipes, hav not tried any of their recipes, but many look interesting. Integration with Apple‚Äôs  heart kit is seamless and being to get a quick look on the watch is also a plus. Had an initial issue with the new Snap-it feature, but it turned out to be user issue. Put a ticket in and they responded within a few minutes to address my question. Would recommend this app to anyone that is truly interested in keeping track of their diet, daily food intake and exercise in one easy to use app.

Title: Conscious Eating + Mild Fitness = Success!
----------------------------------------------------------
Since I've started the Lose it App, 9 days ago, I have already lost a total of 4 pounds! I'm a female, 5'3", started at 139 lbs, with a goal weight of 124lbs. I didn't take calorie counting or exercise seriously, especially when I started this app. But I feel like just being conscious of what I'm consuming & starting to see the patterns of foods that have less calories but keep me full longer is keeping me on track! I go over my suggested calorie count everyday by a couple hundred calories, but even with that, I'm still losing weight at a healthy rate! The minimal exercise I'm doing every other day are isolated muscle moves (ie. 30 squats, 30 lunges, 30 leg lifts, 30 dips, and 30 pushups). I'm as surprised as you might be if you use this app! It's a great tool to keep you focused on your goal, and be concious and aware of your daily intake + fitness to reach your goal weight by a realistic & healthy date. I'm a happy customer so far, and the app was free which makes it even better!! Good luck on reaching your goals!!

Title: Stop fighting it.
----------------------------------------------------------
I went years insisting that tracking my food was only making me obsessed with food. Writing down every morsel only made me feel more controlled by food. I had used LoseIt! On and off for a few years, but never lasted more that 2 weeks being consistent. In 2018, I decided to really focus on my goals for an upcoming trip. In less than 30 days I had hit my mini goal. I managed to stick to a plan through my vacation and tracked for 60 days straight. I upgraded to premium. And then promptly fell off again. The weight came right back on and I stumbled through the next two years miserable. In April 2020, under lock down, I tried again. I just hit 150 days and I am completely convinced that tracking your food is a major key to successful weight loss. Even if I get behind a day or two, I put something in for everyday and keep pushing through. I have my Fitbit Charge and scale linked in so my weight and activity are all tracked automatically. It couldn‚Äôt be easier! I am half way to my ultimate goal. Thank you, LoseIt!

Title: 13 pounds gone! It‚Äôs as easy as that!
----------------------------------------------------------
I started around late April this year trying to lose some weight. I am a 5‚Äô9 female and at my peak weighed 187 pounds. I was seeing permanent changes to my body because of the gain and so I decided I needed to make some changes. It‚Äôs been a couple months since I started using Loose It!. I have lost 13 pounds (I am now at 174) and I am so much happier. I feel less insecure, everyday tasks are easier, and lemme tell you that this is a great way to maintain weight loss habits. You can eat almost anything you want (mind the calories however) without feeling stressed. All you need to do is plan your meals ahead of time. I did a small amount of exercise, nothing huge, on a regular basis. I went bike riding and walking and it‚Äôs helping me build up some muscle. I plan to lose around 24 more ponds which would rest me at 150 lbs. Lose It! hasn‚Äôt just helped me lose weight, but it has also helped me realize how much bad stuff is in things I used to simply disregard. For all this in more the price seems like nothing.

Title: I am very impressed with this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I highly recommend this app. Using look and feel common to many iPhone apps, this program really does make it easy to log your calories, exercise, cholesterol, sodium, and other important items. As you log and watch what you eat, you see the results and why they happen. It reinforces a healthy lifestyle and teaches you the actual truth about bad foods and habits, all at once. I am a very busy lawyer, father of 2 and caregiver to an elder, and I have no time for this. Yet I was able to incorporate logging into my life using this program. I have never successfully done it before. The program crashed a couple of times but no data was lost and it popped right back up. I doubt it was this app that crashed as I have this happen from time to time anyway. If you want to be on a lifetime eating and exercise program rather than a freakish temporary diet, get this app and learn to love your iPhone. I am down 8 pounds in the first couple of weeks and looking forward to using this until I reach my desired weight.

Title: Extremely helpful weight loss tool
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using the free version of Lose It since July 2017.  Tracking my calories with this app has helped me immensely through my weight loss.  I‚Äôve lost 55 lbs just by making sure I log my calories and try to stay at a deficit.  I always log what I eat, even if I know I have been eating too much, so that I can understand where I‚Äôm at and where I need to be. I have PCOS and other metabolic issues and I didn‚Äôt think it was possible to lose weight.  It‚Äôs coming off slowly, but as long as I am patient and consistent and keep track, I know the scale will eventually move. I‚Äôve done this with no special diet or gym memberships.  Just logging calories and watching portion sizes.  I still eat all the foods I love, I‚Äôm just more mindful now of portion sizes and moderation.  I still have at least 40 lbs to lose, and I know with Lose It, it IS possible! Even if it takes another year and a half.  Patience and consistency are key.  If I can do it I know anyone can.  Lose It has made it that much easier.

Title: It works!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am a man in my early 50s and I‚Äôve always been in pretty decent shape but had gained a lot of weight through before and through the pandemic‚Ä¶ My doctor was concerned and wanted me to lose about 20 pounds‚Ä¶ She suggested a couple of things but one of them was a food tracking app I had used another similar app before to lose a few pounds but I found this app and like it the best so far‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs easy to use, it syncs with my Apple Watch which is really a great thing and it‚Äôs been pretty accurate so far‚Ä¶ The only criticism I have is it seems to have very few confirmed calorie counts with some foods - seems to be a lot of user posted calories and some of them are so way off I know they aren‚Äôt accurate so I have to be careful about that‚Ä¶ But I started out at 219 pounds and now I‚Äôm down to 197! My goal is 178 pounds which puts my BMI in the healthy range‚Ä¶ So I‚Äôve still got some work to do but this app is helping along with getting outside and walking 2 to 3 miles most every day‚Ä¶ I feel so much better!

Title: Like but not total love
----------------------------------------------------------
When I first switched to lose it, it was because I had friends using the app over myfitnesspal. So I was extremely disappointed when the app didn‚Äôt allow you insight to all your macros etc. without going premium the way myfitnesspal does. I bit the bullet and got premium and now track my calories, steps, exercises etc with lose it and my Fitbit synced to it. I have gotten used to all the features and I do enjoy the overall calories under or over for the week report because staying true to your goal is easier to do when you see how one stupid meal can keep you from that 1lb for the week. I wish there were more customizable features however for people who do intermittent fasting, as I go between my calorie budget of like 1700 and 500 every other day. So it‚Äôd be nice to customize weeks a little better. Overall the app does its job. I like the graphs, and insights and the community challenges and badges‚ÄîI‚Äôm very competitive. So yea, thanks Lose It for helping me get closer to my goal.

Title: Versatile and robust‚Äîbets app for tracking
----------------------------------------------------------
I used Lose It daily and it helped me to get back into shape and lose a few pounds before my wedding. But beyond losing weight, it helped me to be healthier. I use the barcode scan but I LOVE that you can add your own recipes. The nutrition break down is the best‚Äîit‚Äôs simple and straightforward. You can see if you‚Äôre not consuming enough protein (I was not) or too much sugar, etc. I‚Äôve worn a Fitbit for years and tracked food w Lose It separately for a while. Then I decided to try tracking food through Fitbit (I was no longer trying to lose weight and liked the idea of having everything in one place). The Fitbit app for food/nutrition leaves a lot to be desired. Lose It is so much more flexible, robust, and accurate. I actually learned from Lose It. After taking a break form LI to use only Fitbit for a year, I just rejoined. My recipes are all still here and I‚Äôm thrilled. I feel Lose It just helped me be healthier and make better choices. I also just love the app‚Äôs interface.

Title: Week one down
----------------------------------------------------------
I stepped on the scale a week ago and could have cried with how much weight I had gained since leaving my profession as a Correctional Officer.  I hit a low point in my life in April 2018 and turned to food as a comfort.  I gained a stupid amount of weight in a very short period of time. One year ago I was avid about eating healthy and working out.  I was very disappointed with myself and how I had let myself go. I got the app August 5,2018.  I‚Äôve only had this app a week and have went from 182 down to 175.6.  I‚Äôm using the free version.  It is extremely helpful in tracking calories and the data base of food it has on it is amazing.  I love that I can scan the barcode of what I‚Äôm eating and it comes right up! I have been doing this with very very little exercise. Some days I don‚Äôt exercise at all and I‚Äôm lucky to get 1 mile of walking in every day.  My body does feel drained from the sudden switch to lower calories and carbs, but that is to be expected. I love this app!

Title: Awesome
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app! Every time I‚Äôve gained some weight I‚Äôve turned to this app. The best part of using this app is just that it makes me aware of what I‚Äôm eating. I can look back over my food log and I realize just how much junk food and snacking I‚Äôve been doing. You‚Äôre not going to find the *exact* calories of what you‚Äôre eating but for me, it‚Äôs about what you‚Äôre eating. I love how when it comes to exercise, specially with running, the app lets me manual enter the calories I burned. My treadmill tells the amount of calories and it‚Äôs so much easier just putting in the number it gives me to the app. The only thing that I would suggest change wise, is when it comes to exercises like sit-ups, push ups, or crunches that the app should let you put in the amount you did versus how long you took to do the activity. I can take a lot of breaks in between sets but I know how many I did. How many sit-ups I do in a minute can be vastly different than how many another person can do.

Title: Gracias
----------------------------------------------------------
Lost 50 pounds in 4 months with 1000 calories a day...First I started using My Fitness Pall then I found Loose It ! Though a friend from work.  It has been very helpful in seeing how may calories I was eating and didn‚Äôt need.... ive also used a scale to measure my foot intake and measuring spoons to aid me in Being more accurate... I stoped using Loose It when I hit my 50 lbs mark of weight loss around May ...and then I noticed the pounds coming back up ... happy to say I came back to logging my foods again  before I gain it all back... I now know that I will have to log in all my meal because of lack of self control...I have gotten a lot better at not eating fast food at work everyday and not pigging out on chocolate Halloween candy instead of a meal...  Thank u all for this app... if my husband would let me get LooseIt Premium I would, to help u guys in your mission in helping people have achieve a better eating life style..... Thanks Again.            -Ducky

Title: Best weight loss app EVER!
----------------------------------------------------------
Unlike many apps, they almost force you to buy the app, or so many features you need aren‚Äôt available since you didn‚Äôt buy it. Lose it! on the other hand has all of the necessities available. Not only that, but it seriously has EVERY SINGLE FOOD IN THE WNTIRE WORLD. yes. I ate a brand of yogurt today and it had the brand and the type of yogurt it was. It is unbelievable how helpful it is! It helps you get where you want to and makes it sorta fun along the way. Losing 2 pounds gives you a message that says ‚Äúyou lost the weight of a pineapple! Keep going!‚Äù If that‚Äôs not fun or encouraging for a food app idk what is. I can‚Äôt even really explain how happy I am with this app! It also lists, again, almost every single workout you can do, and on average how much calories people lose from it. This is really helping with my New Years resolution and I am just so happy! Thank you so much creators for making this app! I am enjoying it and hope others may as well! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Title: Solid App (the subscription is worth it)
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has changed my life. I‚Äôve lost OVER 50lbs using it so far and it‚Äôs been a bit under a year. I‚Äôm not a bot here trying to tell you that this product is the one to help you loose weight. This app won‚Äôt do the work for you, but it will set you up for success as well as something could for weight loss. You get so many great recipes, the food is very easy to log. It‚Äôs actually kinda hard to log food at restaurants so it helps keep me from eating out a lot. This thing also tracks more than calories, it‚Äôs important your eating the right balance of carbs, fats, and proteins. As well as making sure you are watching how much sugar you intake. What I did is I went to reliable websites and looked up how much of each of those my body should intake. After that I set them in the app as my maximum. Ever since then I‚Äôve been burning 2 lbs a week for almost a year. Best app buy I‚Äôve ever payed for if you are committed to loosing weight... this is your time.

Title: Great weight loss app!  For Macros not so much
----------------------------------------------------------
I purchased the premium.  This is a great weight loss tool if you just want to reduce your calories and fat to loose weight and it has great tools for recipes and exercise.  I highly recommend this app if you are going on a reduced calorie low fat diet!! For those of us watching our macros it can get a little frustrating having to leave the food log and then go into the goals to see where you are every meal on your fat, carb and protein ratio.  It does allow you to enter your own macro ratio but it does not have a macro calculator in app.  You can use the free macro calculators on the internet, calculate your macros then come back in the app and add your own.  I have saved mine in goals but every few days it resets and I have to re enter.  So this is a great food log and calorie monitoring app, the food entries are vast and it has great tools!!  I just wish it would be easier to custom fit to the lifestyle you chose to lose weight.

Title: Great app for tracking
----------------------------------------------------------
The interface on this app is super simple and visually pleasing. It‚Äôs highly intuitive. If I designed my own app for tracking, this would be it! I got Premium because I love the connection between the app and my Fitbit, and like being able to track my water and BP in one place. I think the price, even the full $39, is really fair for a year of Premium. I‚Äôll probably get a life membership if they go on sale, because to stay healthy, I‚Äôm going to need to track for life. A couple weeks in, I haven‚Äôt experienced any glitches Or issues. I‚Äôve lost a few pounds, though my goal with the app was just to be more mindful with my eating, particularly during the pandemic. I love that I‚Äôm able to better see the connection between what I eat and how much I need to exercise to burn the calories. This is not a fad diet or get thin quick scheme. Just old fashioned counting of calories in and out, which is what successful healthy weights are made of.

Title: It‚Äôs great
----------------------------------------------------------
Started this program with a brothers-in-law the 27th of November 2017 not really expecting much. To my surprise Lose It worked great for me. Took a little to get used to all the servings part of the program ‚Äú to many options‚Äù but figured it out. 10 months & 28 days later I hit my goal of 200lbs, a 65lb loss. No exercise & ate most of what I was eating before. ‚Äú Lose It ‚Äú helps me mainly with my portion control which was my biggest challenge. Blood pressure is was down & I feel great. Knees don‚Äôt hurt like before and have much more energy. Can‚Äôt wait for my cardiologist to see the end results. Last visit to him I had just started using ‚ÄúLose It ‚Äú and had lost a few pound, maybe ten pounds.  Time to start getting toned now that I feel better and have the energy. Have gotten my wife, my cousin & her family on it and they‚Äôve had great results also. Thank you so much ‚ÄúLose It ‚Äú. Btw I was 60 when I started, so age isn‚Äôt an issue.

Title: Very Useful
----------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to revamp my eating lifestyle, and LoseIt was the main tool I used to do so. The food database wasn't amazing, but with immediate access to food history it very quickly becomes an easy process to log each day. It's also community based, so it‚Äôs getting better. It's just a really straightforward, convenient log for food and weight, and if you use it constantly, as immediately as possible, adding EVERYTHING regardless what or what size - it's on your phone, and doesn't take more time or energy than sending a text-it will help you. With long enough use you'll become more conscientious about your eating habits, and healthier as a result. I tried premium for a bit back in 2016 and while some aspects were useful you're not missing a ton without it. I know the challenges  have become premium only, which is sad since they were a fun way to get more involved with the app, but they were also a bit limited, and inessential.

Title: Approaches great, but is only good.
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is a good calorie counter with a very diversified database. Information on calories and nutrients are available on most every entry. My only real complaints about this app are twofold: 1.) The app is very intricate and involved, which can be a plus if you know where everything is and you want to tweak this or that. If there is a help or training site for this app I have not found it and it has been about 10 days of frustration trying to figure out where everything is. I have finally mostly done so but it is not a recommendation for this app. 2.) Many of the entries in the database are, ‚Äúper serving‚Äú. This is fine if you are eating at a restaurant, but can be very frustrating if you are fixing your own meals at home. For example, is the serving size of a tablespoon, a ladle full, or just ‚Äúdump the whole pot on your plate‚Äù? There is no way to know and it makes tracking your calorie intake very problematic at best.

Title: Going downhill
----------------------------------------------------------
When I first started using Lose It! on July 1, 2018, I loved it. Within a couple of weeks I sprang for the Premium version and for a couple of weeks, I was glad I did. Since then though, the app has gone straight downhill. I have entered my data faithfully (daily) for close to three months (ever since July 1st), yet most of lost. The ‚ÄúInsights‚Äù Lose It! used to send me (‚Äòwe notice on days when you eat eggs you stay on track better than when you don‚Äôt, etc) ceased more than a month ago with no explanation. The social piece of the app - that which allowed me to see the progress and inspiration messages of other users and to post my own - was discontinued within a few weeks of me paying for Premium. Each week I get the same message that I haven‚Äôt been using the app long enough to make predictions about my progress. By the end of the week it makes a prediction, and then the same silly song and dance starts next week.

Title: Been working wonderfully for several years!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is wonderful! I‚Äôve used it off and on for years both paid and free. It syncs with apple watch and Fitbit (I‚Äôve used it for both). The app makes tracking easy. You can add custom recipes for homemade foods (tip: works even better if you have a scale to weigh ingredients as you cook). The app has an excellent built-in database with thousands of foods ranging from fresh fruits & veggies, to snacks and fast food menu items. You can even take pictures of barcodes of many foods to instantly populate the nutrition info. If you‚Äôre new to tracking, this app can be eye opening. It allows you to see just how many calories you eat and where they come from. This app is like a budget for your body. Just like budgeting shows you where your money has gone and is going, this app is great at showing where your caloric budget is and keeps you informed so you can make more informed decisions and choices throughout the week.

Title: Lose it app
----------------------------------------------------------
Everyone raves about the app my fitness pal but you need 3.0 or higher readers to see the small font.  Search for changing the font and it‚Äôs not possible.  I went to Lose it and I found I could read it easily ( I‚Äôm not 22) and it was intuitive and has equally as strong database of foods and all the same bells and whistles.  I like the advantage of using notes.  This is where I note what went wrong or right and why.  I reread my notes to remind myself of past mistakes in order to avoid repeating them.  Trying to develop new habits takes rehearsing.  All in all the same apps, this one seems more user friendly to me and I also paid the premium fee for one year and I like the ‚Äúinsights‚Äù piece that analyzes what you eat along  with your weight and makes recommendations such as ‚Äúit seems you lose more weight on days you eat more protein and lower carbs‚Äù etc.  It is a good app and the premium feature is worth it.

Title: Great App!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve used the free version of this app to keep track of my calories, steps, workouts, and water intake and have seen changes in my body and on the scale. It‚Äôs a great way to keep track of my eating habits and make the necessary changes to be healthier and to lose weight. When you get the app, you set a goal plan, your height and weight, and the app keeps track of your progress and how much weight you lose each day. It has the option to track your weight everyday, but obviously, you don‚Äôt have to do that. I chose to do it because I like to see my weight range. It lets you know the nutrition in your food, such as carbs, fats and protein intake, and even lets you know when it catches positive patterns in your day-to-day food intake. I‚Äôve used the app for free for over 5 months now, and the changes I‚Äôve seen have been with the free version. I‚Äôm ready to buy the premium version and let y‚Äôall know what I think!

Title: Great would recommend!!! but could be better
----------------------------------------------------------
So, I haven‚Äôt been using this app for log but I have already lost 6 almost 7 pounds. It is great for calorie management but, you have to pay to get premium. I don‚Äôt like apps that you have to pay to get stuff. If you pay you can manage protein, carbohydrates, water intake and some more things. If you don‚Äôt have premium then you can only count calories, weight and exercise but I still like the app. Another thing is that some foods are hard to find. Also I wish they would have local restaurants foods to log not just chain restaurant foods. Some of the foods that you can log are very specific too. Also they don‚Äôt have some common exercises to log. A good thing about it is you can make an exercise with the amount of calories burned if it is not there. Also you can put in a food with how many calories is in it if it is not there. But overall, I would recommend this app to anyone wanting to loose weight.

Title: 27 pounds and counting
----------------------------------------------------------
So I started with this app late august 19 with me tipping the scales just over 200 so far I‚Äôve follow this app the best I could (of course had a few extra cheat day than I would like to admit). I was following the plan of losing 2 pounds of week and a while goes by of me following the plan (again not perfectly) and this week I get a notification after updating my weight I‚Äôve lost the weight of a normal sized corgi (roughly 26 pounds I think it said) lol. So I‚Äôve lost about 27 pounds by following this app with no money invested. I would highly recommend this app it has helped me a lot with loosing weight. I took some before and after pictures and when I see the difference and that much more motivation to keep going and not to mention a confidence booster. So I rate this app 5 stars with no money invested. I‚Äôm sure the paid version has a lot tools at your disposal but not necessarily to get results!

Title: Life changing
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using Lose It! for four months now. I did buy the subscription so I could be more conscientious of my food choices. As an example, at times I feel hungry but have eaten the same amount of calories as the day prior, I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs because I ate low amounts of protein or fiber. It has allowed me to overall balance my diet and weight. I have lost 16lbs now, about a pound a week, which I am very happy with. I was 162lbs when I started, my goal weight is 135lb. I love how the allotted calories per meal adjusts based on what I‚Äôve eaten so far that day. Once I meet my goal weight I am going to continue to track my weight as well because it does allow you to adjust your goal to ‚Äòmaintain your current weight.‚Äô I‚Äôve never successfully lost weight before and the accountability that this app makes me have is life changing. I recommend it to all of my friends and family trying to lose weight!!

Title: Love It!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve tried to track calories before, but to no avail. This made it so easy and was very eye opening to the amount of calories I was consuming at times. I got tired of endless dieting. I think I‚Äôve been dieting for 20 years straight. I decided to quit dieting and attempt to eat healthy while watching my calorie intake. I‚Äôm actually eating good food while eating healthy and losing weight. As of this morning I‚Äôm down 35 lbs and just finished logging my 100th day!  If I know I have an occasion coming up, or want to eat something higher in calories, I just plan ahead and allow for the calories. My only complaint with the app is that some of the food items that are listed as verified are wrong or are incomplete on the nutritional data. Very user friendly. A couple times I‚Äôve thought, I wish the app would do this or that. After a little research I found out it actually already does. Great app.

Title: Amazing app
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this calorie counter. It links seamlessly with my Apple Watch and is so helpful for planning meals and balancing exercise with calorie intake. There are so many insures and features. I would like to shoot some ideas at the developers though. First, a BMI calculator, this will help users to see there medical body score and to reach a goal of ‚ÄòNormal‚Äô or to help people with ‚Äòunder-weight‚Äô scoring gain back in a healthy way. Second, actual meal times. Anyone who has successfully lost weight understands that balancing calories and exercise, and timing you meals correctly are key to success. Third, the option to ‚Äòmaintain‚Äô a normal body weight. Instead of just lose. I think the app is a great addition to daily routine even with out these features though. I definitely would recommend to anyone trying to lose weight or just live a healthy lifestyle. Thank you for creating!!!

Title: This App is Everything!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have never reviewed an app before and usually hate that they prompt you to review before you‚Äôve even tried it out. This review is unprompted I just wanted to share my great experience with this app. I used it back in 2011 and lost 23 lbs quickly, so needing to lose again I turned to Lose It! and have lost 11lbs in my first 6 weeks back on. The premier membership is So Worth the money I spent. It has helped me take control over my eating and other health goals. It has a great selection of foods for logging your eating and It‚Äôs accurate for the most part, but lets you adjust the nutrition facts as needed. App has a lovely interface and is very easy to use, unlike some others I have tried. I also like that you can change the theme to other beautiful backgrounds.  I especially love the social feature that allows you to chat with other users and get additional motivation.

Title: Good but with a little work could be great
----------------------------------------------------------
This has helped me out on a solid weight lose plan.  There are several things the app could do better.  75% of the time it doesn‚Äôt pick the restaurant via your eating at via GPS so have to enter your location.  That part isn‚Äôt so bad, when you get to the list, it should be clear which ones are information provided by the company and which ones are some people have added.  Then for each item, you need to go through the same routine, suggestion - once your at the restaurant, each time it should default to that restaurant for each food item.  Also, if you select the wrong food item, because again you can‚Äôt tell which is the real restaurant or an added one, you have to start all over.  The program should also be more intuitive.  There are foods that just go together, the lookup should have them on top.  It‚Äôs a good start but could make a few improvements to be GREAT.

Title: I‚Äôve lost 26 pounds so far.
----------------------------------------------------------
I credit this app with helping me lose weight. Logging my food down at every meal or snack has opened my eyes to how many calories I was eating in a day. When I started with the app I thought it would be a chore opening the app and logging multiple times a day but instead it has become a ‚Äúgame‚Äù to me a challenge of sorts to better my diet each day. I did all this with the free version of the app but I as soon as I finish this review I am purchasing the full version with the added features as it is the right thing to do the to monetize the app creators. My doctor wanted to know what ‚Äúdiet‚Äù I had done I showed him the app. He was very Interested in the details and we spent a great deal off time going over it together. He has begun recommending it to his other patients. 10 more pounds to go for me and I will go into a weight maintenance mode. Thank you Lose It app.

Title: Great app!
----------------------------------------------------------
Lose It may not be the sleekest looking app out there, but it just works. I‚Äôve tried other apps, like LifeSum, and they just don‚Äôt measure up. Lose It is packed full of functionality, and its core feature set works the better than any other food tracker I‚Äôve tested. The database has both verified and user submitted foods, which means almost anything I could want to log is available. The app is smart about suggesting previous meals, which means that I rarely even need to search for the food to log; it‚Äôs already a suggestion. The app is full of little smart UX ideas like this that make it easier to use than competitor apps. My only real wish is that the design could be improved a bit, because it looks a bit dated to me. The icon was recently updated and looks much better though, so I‚Äôm hopeful that the team is working on more great changes. Keep up the good work!

Title: Great app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used lose it off and on for a few years. The past year and a half I have used it as a premium member. I really love how easy the app is to track my foods throughout the day. It remembers foods I log often, which is so convenient and makes logging quick! I also love the "verified" food calories with a little green check mark! I love that I can set goals, specifically for how many grams of each macronutrient I want and/or percentages for each. I would really love to be able to set a goal for how many servings of fruits and vegetables I want to eat per day! I would also really like to see categories that track caffeine intake based on foods I log. I use lose it in conjunction with Apple health and some categories for nutrition don‚Äôt update because lose it doesn‚Äôt track them. Would love to see more details in the nutrition tracking to link to my health app.

Title: Most used app. Truly 5 stars
----------------------------------------------------------
I actually use the free version exclusively and only to put on weight, and I didn‚Äôt have to search for a weight-gain app after This. I like the style, crisp colors, clean design and sturdy compartments, responsive buttons, search bar works well, no application frustration. I don‚Äôt understand how they have all that food available to log; it‚Äôs so diverse and specific, there‚Äôs only a couple times I‚Äôve searched and not found a specific food. But even then, I find something similar enough and go with that. It‚Äôs easy to change mistakes or add more food, but my favorite part by far is this: when you put food in for a meal it immediately generates Calorie counts and a pie graph to separate macros. Without this app I‚Äôm just guessing and quickly figured out I was drastically off my daily intake without the log, so I wasn‚Äôt making any gains. With this I make all kinds.

Title: Quickly Became My Favorite App
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded this app to keep better control of my caloric intake. I used the Weight Watchers App primarily, but it does not have a great listing of foods, and the calorie total isn‚Äôt kept automatically. After a little while I decided to try the Premium version for one year, and I‚Äôm glad I did. This app very quickly became my absolute favorite app. The food library is amazingly robust. There are listings for items I eat that you just don‚Äôt find anywhere else (go ahead, try to find a Premier Protein Vanilla shake already listed in most diet trackers). And it keeps different totals organized for you for easy references. Documentation is amazing, with the ability to produce daily, weekly and monthly reports, either printed or emailed. You can keep daily notes for referencing important information about your diet, and entering your weigh at any time is a breeze.

Title: Loving this app
----------------------------------------------------------
To be totally honest I have always hated anything to do with counting calories as a way to lose weight because of how complicated it is to keep track and to how exactly how many calories in each food much less an entire meal. This app has changed my mind completely. It is so easy and fun to use . I totally love the barcode scanner which makes it super easy to use and you can even put in your own recipes add the foods you are using and it gives you a calorie count you can even take pictures. This has helped me keep track of all the foods I‚Äôm consuming and make better choices. I recommend this app to everyone trying to lose weight and even maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle. I will continue to use it because to me it‚Äôs fun and I take it as a personal challenge to stay within my daily calories. Very simple, easy to navigate, and makes losing weight FUN.

Title: Great for calories, nutrition, and weight loss
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like the ease of use of this app. Logging food is simple and the barcode feature is great (though you do have to check the accuracy of the information and not just assume it is correct). Adding your own recipes and foods is a great feature that I regularly use. I‚Äôve already lost 10 pounds since the start of the year. However, I have trouble getting it to sync with my Apple Health app. I like to keep all my data in one place, so it‚Äôs a great feature, but its troubleshooting problems with syncing is basically ‚Äúare you sure all the right permissions are turned on and the software is updated?‚Äù Yes, the answer is always yes, and I still have a warning sign and can‚Äôt get my nutrition data. Would really like to see this feature stabilized. My partner syncs with FitBit and doesn‚Äôt have any issues other than thinking the walking bonus is too generous.

Title: Emotions cause my weight to fluctuate
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve had 4 children during the time I‚Äôve had this app and it has always helped me lose that weight after having them. With the setup to Fitbit and all the challenges it really helps ppl like me who are competitive. Also, I do have widely fluctuating emotional states so in those states I will stop using this and eat for comfort and gain between 10 and 20 lbs but in just a couple months be back to a healthy weight with this app. I do wish I could just eat healthy all the time and have no problem with exercising regularly but for those of us just not blessed in that way this really helps. Also, I do have 4 children, a husband, we have multiple businesses and I homeschool so this definitely helps to keep being healthy on my list of things to do and in the daily rotation. I really can‚Äôt say enough about this app but I thank God for it, I‚Äôm truly grateful!

Title: I lost 80 lbs. thanks to Lose It.
----------------------------------------------------------
I began a diet in July of 2019.  I found trying to keep track of calories to be a pain in the neck, and not very accurate.  I wondered of there was an app to help.  Apple had Lose It listed prominently, so I got the free app.  It made keeping track of calories and my weight SO much more efficient.  It took me about a year, but I was able to drop 80 lbs. by using this app to keep me on track.  I have recommended it to MANY people (usually the one‚Äôs who ask how I lost all that weight), and I would recommend it to you if your thinking about it.  One thing you need to do is get a food scale if you don‚Äôt have one already.  There are some that connect via Bluetooth to make recording easier (I had to manually input everything since my older food/postal scale didn‚Äôt have that feature).  Also, don‚Äôt buy the junk!  If it‚Äôs not in the pantry, you won‚Äôt eat it.

----------------------------------------------------------
I have used this Ap for years now, on and off but never on Premium until this diagnosis.  Being diagnosed with NAFLD was an eye opener.  I needed to lose weight, track water intake, calories and track sodium.  I can do all of that on Lose It.  My Doctor even asked if I had heard of the Ap.  I can go to any restaurant and find the food in the Ap, scan barcodes of what I am cooking.  There is a great area for socializing with other Lose It users.  You can join groups and challenges people really support each other on here. I tried the other well known Ap for tracking and it‚Äôs just not as easy to use nor does it have all the foods Lose It does. Thank you Lose It!  I‚Äôm down 15 lbs in the three weeks since diagnosis!  It‚Äôs a drop in the bucket to my goal of 100 lbs.  The Ap says by my April 28 birthday I will be down 50 lbs!  I‚Äôm looking forward to 47!

Title: Attractive Intuitive Comprehensive Package
----------------------------------------------------------
I just spent the past two days looking at the other popular programs like this. This one nailed everything needed and wanted in a pleasing easy-to-use design. After spending three days struggling with some other popular apps‚Äîyou know the ones‚ÄîI downloaded this one and in minutes I was able to use it and had searched and found foods in the database. Scanning was also a snap. Setup was a breeze. It gives social media options if you like, manages your nutrients and water, and keeps up with your exercise to offset intake. This app is really the king‚ÄîI prefer Queen‚Äîand it‚Äôs not a busy screen glut of information or trying to sell me fitness gear and be my pal. It‚Äôs not trying to sum up my entire life. It‚Äôs an attractive, easy-to-learn, snap-to-use effective tool to support healthy eating and weight management. All that, economical, and a 7-day trial.

Title: Great results
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using Lose it! Because I needed a way to hold myself accountable and stop lying to myself.  This helped me track what I put in my body and how much I was eating, as well as realize I needed to find ways incorporate exercise into my life ( walking more... or even chores like vacuuming).  I will admit, at first I was so use to over eating and making bad choices that I still felt hungry the first few days until my body adjusted to eating correct portion sizes.  I started this less than a month ago, but just by eating better and realizing that if I was going to go over my budget I needed to go for a walk, I was able to drop quite a bit of weight.  You just have to be honest with your self and portions.  Don‚Äôt guess, measure it out to your best ability.  I hope you all have great success too!  I‚Äôm only a few lbs away from my goal weight!

I‚Äôm not the one to usually write reviews but I‚Äôve got to say this is app is the one for me. I‚Äôve always had such a hard time figuring out how many calories I should eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even a snack. This app broke it down for me and made things so much easier. It‚Äôs one thing to record what you‚Äôre eating but it‚Äôs another when you start out light at the start of your day and end with a heavier meal. Something I never knew. I also love how it gives you a projection to look forward to as long as you stay on pace and even recognizes patterns and goes into details about your diet. I‚Äôm currently only using the free version but have been considering the premium. If you‚Äôre really committed to losing weight and exercise regularly along with this app everyday you‚Äôll see results. Down 20lbs in just 3 weeks but have a long way to go.

Title: Great app, can‚Äôt show pregnancy status
----------------------------------------------------------
I like this app a lot. I graduated college with a nutrition major and I had a lot of assignments that had me track my food as we tried out different diets and this app made tracking all those things as painless as possible. I LOVE that I can input recipes and use servings from the dinner recipe I created. One thing I wish the developers would add though is a place that I can mark if I‚Äôm pregnant or not.  I‚Äôve used this a few times while being pregnant and while it can record what I eat just fine it can‚Äôt show me if I‚Äôm meeting all my daily nutritional requirements because those change during pregnancy. Also the weight and calorie aspects become completely null since every pregnancy experiences weight gain and that‚Äôs not due to bad eating as well as calorie requirements change. So great app, I just wish I could tell it if I‚Äôm pregnant.

Title: Losing It!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Since I started this app a week ago, I‚Äôve lost nearly 5lbs. I like how it gives you a daily caloric budget and a projected completion date based on your goals. It makes me more conscious of the things I eat, even condiments. I also like that it connects to Apple Health, which I have connected to my Apple Watch and the RENPHO app, and when those apps update so does Lose It. Within in the last 24-hours I‚Äôve lost 2lbs!! It‚Äôs really cool. I don‚Äôt have the premium version so I don‚Äôt keep track of my water intake, but the only problem that I have with the app is that some of the ‚Äúverified‚Äù foods are still wrong and so I have readjust the portions on the app to get to or near the actual amount of calories I‚Äôve consumed. Maybe an update is overdue or something, idk. Other than that I really enjoy this app and would recommend it to anyone!!!

Title: Great app
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a great app. Even the free version is wonderful, unlock some apps where the free version bombards you with ads. This one doesn‚Äôt. The free version gives you everything you need to be able to track food and lose weight, and the premium version lets you set even more nutritional goals and shows you your eating trends and gives you access to recipes and so much more.  I used to do another program where you track points instead of calories but I didn‚Äôt want to pay $20/month or weigh in at goal monthly to keep the app. For less than 2 months cost of the other app I have access for an entire year to the premium version of this and it‚Äôs worth every penny. This is SO MUCH BETTER!! By tracking calories it‚Äôs easy to make choices throughout the day. I feel in control again. I love this app!! If you are ready to ‚Äúlose it‚Äù get this app.

Title: Heart failure vegan
----------------------------------------------------------
I had Heart Failure/A Fib the beginning of February 2018. Despite my mostly vegan diet I struggled with weight and too much tummy for a 6‚Äô1‚Äù 67 year old man. I started using Lose It! and a calorie restriction diet after a week in the hospital. Caffeine, alcohol, dairy, sugary crap and bread are now gone. Plenty of fresh vegetables and some fruits. Big salad at dinner with fresh lemon as a salad dressing. I am down over 20 pounds in 6 weeks with 20 more to go. No exercise. I have a bad hip and I am waiting for Cardiologist to release me for cardiac rehab to begin safe exercise. I weigh myself every morning and keep a log. A couple of days away from new heart tests. Healing will take time. Weight maintenance and a healthy lifestyle is a process and not a goal. Couldn‚Äôt have done it without Lose It!  Well worth the premium upgrade.

Title: Just what I need
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve always enjoyed this app to help me kick start my diets, and they‚Äôve only consistently made it better. I love the scan feature to calorie count, it decreases time from manually entering everything and includes other parts of the nutritional label. I also love that it works with certain other apps like my scale to integrate my weight so I never have to actually put it in. Also, it gets my steps off my Apple Watch and takes the calories I‚Äôve earned and adds them to my calorie allowance, huge plus! I‚Äôve always used the free features just fine, and my husband upgraded my account when he found a sale. To be honest I only use the water counter that was added by the upgrade which I really didn‚Äôt need before because my water bottle has the markings on it to keep track of ounces. In the end I highly recommend and love the app.

Title: A Little Attention to the App & I Lose Weight
----------------------------------------------------------
I am 58, and I find that the weight goes on much more easily than it comes off. I tried a few different diets to get my weight under control, but they all limited the types of food I could eat and either didn‚Äôt work at all or only worked in the short term. With this app, I‚Äôve gone from gaining more than 10 pounds per year to losing 8 pounds in 3.5 months. I simply log everything I eat, log my exercise and stick to my calorie budget. If I have a day that I am over budget, I make it up within the same week so that I am within the weekly budget. No type of food is forbidden on this diet, which fits my lifestyle a lot better than more limiting diets. It only takes a few minutes a day to use the app, so it has easily become a new lifestyle habit. I plan to continue to use the app to monitor food intake for weight maintenance.

Title: I have lost 21 lbs in 88 days!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is a great tool to use for counting calories. It‚Äôs my first and only app I‚Äôve used to do this, so I‚Äôm not sure how other apps are like. I decided to pay for the annual premium version the first week I had it and I think it‚Äôs worth every single penny. It‚Äôs amazing how much of a database it has to track food in terms of restaurant food. It also integrates exercise from Strava or Map My Run which is great to help determine how many calories you burned. I do have to integrate my Garmin app to sync with my Strava so it can track my runs. I also like how it gives you an adjusted budget when you put your daily weight and how many calories you‚Äôre allowed. I wish I downloaded this app sooner! I‚Äôm in the most healthiest shape I‚Äôve been in my life. I not only count calories, but exercise, so I attribute my success to that.

Title: Very intuitive
----------------------------------------------------------
After 2 weeks of use, and personally re-establishing the habit of logging again, I find this very intuitive.  10 yrs ago I very successfully lost 30lbs with weight watchers, so I know the routine.  However, with the changes in their program since then it hasn‚Äôt kept me interested, motivated or on board.  Changes in life got some of the pounds back (injuries, menopause, moves, divorce, job changes...you get the idea), and what it comes down to is that I like knowing the calories v a points system.   The ‚Äúscientist‚Äù in me likes the real story. This app was recommended by my doctor, who said her patients have been successful with it.  Two weeks/3lbs lost.  You get to pick how fast you lose and consequently the sacrifice you‚Äôre willing to make with your calorie intake. It‚Äôs a math problem. Lose It.  Try it, you‚Äôll like it.

----------------------------------------------------------
Food database is full of inconsistencies and duplicates since users can create their own foods for the public to access. I wish a department  on LoseIt Team can be in charge of making sure the database is consolidated and up to date. Although this suggestion would be a welcome change, the app does still work for my needs:) Other than that, you NEED this app if you are trying to to lose weight. I've been trying for years and nothing worked...until I downloaded this app and was more conscious of my food choices (portions, macros,etc.) I've lost 10 pounds since the holidays - DOWNLOAD THIS APP NOW!!!!!! I don't bother logging in my exercise since my calorie burn varies widely, and it‚Äôs different from person to person (and I don't have a Fitbit or something like that) , but I do eat for more energy during my workout days!

Title: Better than WW!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is better than WW because 1Ô∏è‚É£ it‚Äôs wayyyyy cheaper and 2Ô∏è‚É£ it uses calories which is much easier to figure out when grabbing food at the store! No need to pull out your phone and pull up the WW app to see how many points something is, the calories are right there on the package. This app also gives you SO MUCH extra information (breaks down your macros, gives you a predicted date to reach your goal, etc) and it integrates with the Fitbit app AND the Apple health app, so you can bank calories from exercise. i.e. I use the C25K app and another workout app (Workouts for Women...it‚Äôs awesome too!), and they both integrate with the Health app, meaning they then also integrate with the Lose It app to adjust my calories! It‚Äôs great! Love this app and thank you to the developers for seeming to think of everything!!!

Title: It Works!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been weight challenged since I quit smoking 40 years ago.  I have tried every trick in the book, but to no avail!!!  One evening back in February, I was cruising around the web, looking for anything that might help and I found the Lose It app.  I though, what the heck.  It can‚Äôt hurt and, nothing else is working.  Feb 11, I started, with the goal of loosing 60 lbs.  13 weeks later, I am down 30!!!  Also, right on schedule.  I am eating what I enjoy.  The difference is that I keep track of everything that goes in my mouth.  I do eat more protein and fewer carbs.  I do eat the protein before the carbs which seems to help with my blood sugar reaction.  I do enjoy chef salads, and make a meal out of then...  The bottom line, this ‚Äúlife style‚Äù works!  I believe that it is going to change my eating habits for good!

I have tried everything from WW to Keto. I have had success and become a life member with WW. With that said, I can‚Äôt seem to keep the weight of and it frustrates me because every time I go back, they change the whole program and I have to learn EVERYTHING all over again. This program is VERY simple. Absolutely no tricks or mysteries! It‚Äôs simple to use and inspires you to exercise more because the more you do it, the more you get to eat. It‚Äôs a win win. I feel like I can stay with this program forever and be fit and healthy. When I first saw my calories allowed, I almost panicked. It‚Äôs turned out to be really easy though. By the way, I am not obese, nor am I slender. I‚Äôm just your average 55 year old that wants to feel good in public and be able to physically do all the things I want. Two thumbs up for this app!

I‚Äôve had the premium version as long as I can remember so can‚Äôt be much help when it come to that. But LoseIt has been probably one of my biggest loyalty/commitment I‚Äôve ever had in my life (yeah I‚Äôm a big flake!) There is no reason not to. It helps me record and organize data in a clear and manageable fashion... Oh and if you suggest something they will listen to you! I really needed to add time stamps to my food entries for intermittent fasting ... I suggested it and they added it! They really do listen to their customers if you have a reasonable request. I also loved the Embody DNA report that syncs to my LoseIt. I found out what genetics are partly responsible for my diet and physique and the LoseIt app created macros for me based on that report. Integrates well with other apps... I love LoseIt so much!

Title: Game changer!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This APP has literally helped me change my life.  It helps to hold me accountable (of course you have to be honest w/yourself when logging your food! I love all the cool features: huge database of foods t choose from.  Chances are that what you‚Äôre looking for is already in there.  There‚Äôs also a feature where you can simply scan the label of what you‚Äôre trying to log and adjust the serving size accordingly.  You can keep track of your weight, link it to health app on your phone to keep track of your steps too (iPhone). You can even change the themes and personalize it to your specific taste (just a fun extra) I started using this 2 months ago and have lost 11 lbs already.  If you‚Äôre looking for an app that has it all and is effective and fun, look no further!! Highly recommend and I give it 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è!!‚ô•Ô∏è

Title: This app works!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app! I have tried weight watchers, Noom, my fitness pal, and tracking calories through my fitbit app, and this app is the best! It‚Äôs easy to choose how quickly you want to lose weight, find food items in their food bank, and build your own recipes. It also keeps track of how many calories you‚Äôve saved over the week in case you want to splurge on the weekend. I‚Äôm down 10 lbs in about 5 weeks and I don‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm dieting. I‚Äôm just planning my day according to my food budget. I will say Noom was helpful in changing how I thought about food, and I think using this app after completing Noom is a great idea. The free version of this app is amazing, but the $29 annual version allows you to connect with your fitness tracker and that helped me a bit. I am grateful this app exists!

Title: It‚Äôs the first thing that‚Äôs ever worked
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm only about 4 days in and this is the longest I‚Äôve felt consistently motivated and excited about my weight loss. I have struggled so much with developing unhealthy eating habits(starving and binging) through my preteens and teens and this is the first app where I haven‚Äôt felt guilty and wanted to starve. I‚Äôm watching my food intake and paying attention to the protein rather than feeling guilty about how much or little I‚Äôm eating. Now i feel fuller through out my day and understand why I didn‚Äôt before. Not only does Calorie Counter kindly(the genuine notifications) remind you to keep going they also make an effort to ensure you actually understand your body and what the technique your using is actually doing to your body! I typically say don‚Äôt use prescription services but if you can, DO IT

Title: I never write reviews but....
----------------------------------------------------------
So, I NEVER write reviews for apps. I hate writing them I find them pointless but I thought I‚Äôd write it down for this application. First of all, the Free version (not premium) has helped me A L O T. As someone who works and goes to school full time it‚Äôs VERY difficult to find that extra time to exercise. So I usually count of my step counts for the day (9k+ steps daily) and I‚Äôve had this app for about a week now and it‚Äôs helped me lose that pound it said I would with limiting my calories! Although I‚Äôve always been a mental calorie counter this is by far, so much better, considering that all calorie counts for most fast food, restaurants are accurate ! If it isn‚Äôt, you can simply input it yourself! (Not to mention you can actually input the serving you ate.[Ex. 1/2 a banana]) best app yet!

Title: Stay at home mom.
----------------------------------------------------------
Being at home all the time it‚Äôs easy to forget to take care of ourselves. I was feeling sluggish and bored and really didn‚Äôt realize how many calories I was eating. Most foods say how many calories per serving but you have to check how many servings. I decided to start counting my calories and I was shocked when I started realizing this. I was being duped. So once I started using this app I was learning how to be healthier and choosing more healthy options. Do I want a soda or something that will actually fill me? I started making good choices and the pounds really did start coming off. I feel more active and happy and want to do more things with my kids. I am not so tired and my headaches have declined. Choosing good food and limiting yourself intake can have a huge impact on your health.

Title: Easy and simple!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I want to start this review by stating that this is the first app I have ever written a review for, but I love it so much, I have to! I am have used several different apps to count calories, carbohydrates, exercise, etc. but have usually given up on them after a couple of weeks because it‚Äôs too much work and somewhat complicated. This app is so easy to use and simple to track my caloric intake. I absolutely love the feature that links to my Apple Watch as well. I have set it up to link my exercise and allow me those extra calories to consume if I want..... and again.... so easy to sync. I can see how many calories I have left right on the face of my watch..... by simply lifting my wrist!!! It also lets me know how many calories I am under or over for the week. Such a fantastic app!!!!!!!!

Title: The Only Thing That Actually Works For Weight Loss
----------------------------------------------------------
For years I‚Äôve been trying to lose 20-25 lbs through various changes to diet and exercise but resisted counting calories. I always felt like counting and putting in every little thing I ate was too restricting and would mess with my head. I finally decided that I had to do something that I wasn‚Äôt currently doing, and I knew calorie counting had been the most successful thing I had done in the past. In my first month of tracking daily I have lost 5lbs and I know now that I will reach my goal because it‚Äôs really not hard once you start using the data to make little changes and improvements. Instead of thinking of it as restricting I now think of it as exciting and empowering as I get input and use it to continue to lose at a comfortable pace. I love this handy little app! Thanks, Lose it!

Title: Finally...
----------------------------------------------------------
Finally there is an app that I actually listen to and follow!  My whole life, I was the perfect weight...124lbs, I mean, who doesn‚Äôt want to be 124lbs?  I NEVER watched what I ate....EVER!  And then when I hit 40 yrs young, my metabolism decided to turn against me. I gained 70lbs over 5 yrs and also was diagnosed with a large brain tumor in 2013. Naturally, the tumor added to the weight gain due to High blood pressure and water weight. But after the tumor was removed (benign ÕèThank God) I decided to get my life back. My sister told me about LoseIt....I WAS HOOKED!  I mean, I input every aspect of my life(I purchased the premium, of course) and Loseit kept me on track and accountable.  I would be lost without it.  I am down to 141lbs..woot woot!!  And I feel great.   Thank you LoseIt!!!

Title: GET ITTTTTT
----------------------------------------------------------
i have tried everything to lose weight and i always just gain and gain. in a desperation to lose weight, i ended up finding this app. let me tell you, it literally changed my life. i lost 30 freaking pounds in less than four months. i honestly recommend buying the yearly package bc you can add the exercises in and it really helps keep track of the calories you are really losing and gaining, exercising had something to do with the losing too, but the calories coming in really did change and help to lose the weight. i still cannot believe it! you see how much calories a certain item is and it keeps you away from it. i lost 3 pounds in 2 days and it increased to where i lost 15 in one month and a half. it‚Äôs great, it‚Äôs really great. a big motivator and i honestly recommend this app!

Title: Real food, real calories
----------------------------------------------------------
I like the Lose It! app because instead of counting points which are not real you are counting calories which are real and it helps a person learn how rich some of the foods are that we are eating and we can plan much better I like having a budget and when I meet my budget for the day the kitchen is closed I like scanning products I haven‚Äôt used any of the recipes yet but the ones I‚Äôve seen so far are far too many calories I would like to see some articles on how to use the plan to maximize your budget. Thanks.  Ps. Am losing slowly which is healthy.  This is not a gimmick but a realistic tool to help a person count calories and therefore learn to be satisfied with less which is what a body needs.  Excess calories equals excess pounds. And who wants achy joints?  Not this chick!

Title: Everything WW Can Give Online For a Lot Less $$
----------------------------------------------------------
I did WW twice.  I'm not knowing it, but the cost is $45/m.  Now, there are no in person meetings.  So I tried  Noom.  $40/month and they throw too much at you :  facts, quizzes (I'm serious), mantras, etc. The "individual coaches" are too impersonal and mantra-driven.  I already know the Education, what I'm doing wrong, etc.  What has always been my downfall is ceasing to track what passes my lips.  I checked out about 20 apps and finally found  Lose It!  I can track, scan foods like on WW.  For the very...no...extremely low cost, I upgraded to Premium.  I can get education if I want, I can upload my dna file for input as to proper diet, and I joined a few of the offered forum boards based on my demographic and interests.  If I need support,there it is, right there!  GREAT APP!

Title: This App is Amazing!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Between Lose It and Run Keeper I can contribute a great portion of my success! This app has help me lose 70lbs. I have recently decided to try the keto diet and I love that lose it allows me to see what percentage of my calories are carbs, fats and proteins. Initially I just needed to monitor my caloric intake and see what foods in my diet were working against me and track the results. I would recommend it for anyone! I also think it is amazing that you can make Lose It & Run Keeper sync together by paying an upgrade fee! The only downside is most of the challenges are pretty lame as they‚Äôre just created by customers and there‚Äôs no insensitive to compete and try to win even if they are decent. Overall I love this app and have been using it successfully for years! Thanks guys!!!

Title: Happy weight loss
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm very happy with my results while utilizing the lose it app.  I‚Äôm losing weight just like I wanted following my calories intake as It goes down with my weight.  I have been learning how to change my eating habits without being unhappy about giving up certain things that I use to crave.  I really haven‚Äôt even been going to the gym the way I use to.  I have been walking more instead of getting into my car for every errand.  Today I will be getting back to the gym so I can try to make these next 10 lbs come off because these last 5 lbs came off a little slower but I have been attending many family events which means more drinking and eating but I‚Äôm still very happy with my results thanks to tracking everything with lose it.  That is the key.  You must track everything.

Title: Focused data - focused results
----------------------------------------------------------
As I got older, I found that my weight was slowly creeping up, particularly around my abdomen.  I never had given the notion of eating more sensibly a second thought.  A friend suggested the ‚ÄúLose It‚Äù app as a tool to keep track of the foods I was eating, and to use the app to set goals for where I wanted to be.  It worked beyond my wildest expectations, and in one month of using ‚ÄúLose It‚Äù I have lost 15 pounds.  All of this was accomplished simply by becoming aware of what was going into my body, and then following through with the caloric intake suggested by the app. The app is extremely well designed, and even the free version provides a multitude of useful information and practical tools.  Cannot praise the developers of this app enough...truly a job well done!

Title: Best Healthy Lifestyle Tracking App
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using LoseIt for years...it is, hands down, the best app out there for tracking everything I need. It can help you track any healthy lifestyle/diet you are using. I use it for Keto and am able to set up my meals with or without snacks included and I also have an evening tea. It tracks any macros I need including regular carbs and net carbs and I am able to track my protein and fats. This helps me stay in Ketosis and under my calorie allotment for the day. I have lost weight steadily with this and it is an app I intend to use always to reach all of my goals. I pay for the subscription (believe me...it‚Äôs worth it) and I am thinking of switching to Lifetime because I use it that often. If you‚Äôre on the fence about trying it...do it! You won‚Äôt regret it.

Title: Great for counting carbs for diabetes
----------------------------------------------------------
My Dr told me I had high sugar and borderline diabetes and I needed to watch my carbs or I‚Äôm heading to be Type 2 Diabetic. I didn‚Äôt really want to lose weight as I was already where I wanted to be (thanks to Lose It for helping me with that a while back) But keeping track and counting carbs and fats and proteins as directed by my Dr and Nutricianist was a real pain to do everyday. But with the paid Lose It version, it‚Äôs really easy to do now. And I love that I can scan labels of my foods instead of hand entering. Thank you Lose It. This app was better than all of the Carb counting apps i looked at. Easy to use. So even if you aren‚Äôt trying to lost weight, it‚Äôs great for monitoring the nutrients in what you eat if diagnosed with pre-diabetics, like in my case.

This app., if you stay true to everything you intake and excersize and or activities, you WILL lose the weight you want and will meet your goals!!!

Title: REBRAND
----------------------------------------------------------
Just wanted to say i have loved and been using this app for years, before recently going premium. But never have i been trying to ‚Äúlose it‚Äù I use your app to measure macros, water intake, etc. And this app has even helped me to gain weight after suffering severe food intolerances, gut health issues, etc. I believe your app is so much more than just weight loss - it is HELPFUL FOR ANYONE TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH and by branding this way you are losing a wide variety of markets. (To be honest i get embarrassed if anyone sees me open the app for the fear they might think i am trying to lose more weight on my generally skinny frame) Great lifestyle and health app and i think you deserve to call yourselves more than just weight loss, you‚Äôve grown beyond that

Title: Extremely Helpful App That Works!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has helped me shed over 35 lbs in a little over 100 days.  It has a very large database of food items and an easy to use user interface.  It has never crashed on me and they constantly update it.  I had a question for their support team and they quickly responded to it and solved the issue. The annual price is very affordable and tiny when compared to other apps and programs of weight loss.  If you follow this app‚Äôs suggestions and be honest about what you eat, you will lose the weight.  Just follow its guidance day after day and stick to it and it will work.  Most weight loss programs will work if you follow their suggestions.  The difference with this app is that it makes it easy to follow and can be your guiding light on your weight loss journey.

Title: Solid weight loss app
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a really great and well structured app that I've used on and off for years. I finally caved and got premium, which I enjoy. Everything is really efficient. And overall I've lost 35 pounds ü§ó It also has a lot of nice features such as challenges (which can be fun) and there's a social interaction component, I don't use it frequently but I do see how It can be beneficial and build a community feeling. My ONLY complaint is the graph for your macros, no matter what I do, it always shows the fat as a larger portion of the graph than it actually is. For example, I'll have 20 grams of fat compared to 120 grams of carbs and 60 grams of protein and it'll show up as 70% of the graph and it DRIVES me insane. Really need a fix on that, otherwise, a fantastic app.

Title: I Tell Everyone I Know! Lose It! Is Great!
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to do Weight Watchers, but when they changed their points system again, I just couldn't do it and I am not alone in this. That's why when I found Lose It! I thought this was something I could do and I was right. It tracks my calories, my activity, my goal, and also, I get lots more information such as nutrition and where I'm taking in most of my calories. Plus, being someone who likes charts and graphs, I get my information that way, too. I also decided to purchase an activity tracker since it would synchronize with the app and I can't always be carrying my iPhone to track my steps. As an added bonus, my sister, who lives several states away has started using Lose It! and we use the social part of the app to encourage each other. Thank you Lose It!

Title: More than just a weight loss app
----------------------------------------------------------
The food tracking and calorie/macros counties are great! But really what makes this app beyond 5 stars is the meals if you upgrade to premium. Each week has 400-, 450-, and 500- calorie options that give you a week's worth of healthy meals + sides for 2 and they literally did everything for you! You get a grocery list along with recipes and the recipes are a few steps and easy to follow. I also like that it doesn't have a ton of out-there or expensive items in the menus. You get 52 weeks worth of menus with 4 options for each week, so the premium version has 208 weeks worth of menu planning. Even if you're not trying to lose a ton of weight it's a great investment to have essentialy 4 years' worth of meal planning and grocery shopping thought out for you.

Title: Down 7 lbs in 2 weeks
----------------------------------------------------------
Lose it takes the guesswork out of losing weight. I have it synchronized to my Apple Watch and it automatically tracks my caloric expenditures. It makes tracking calories extremely easy, as well. You can simply scan the barcode of what you‚Äôre eating and as long as you‚Äôre honest about serving sizes, it will keep you on track. Unlike other times I‚Äôve tried to lose weight without a calorie counter, I never feel like I‚Äôm starving myself. In the past when that happens, I would struggle with eating before bedtime. Now I can know how many calories I have left in my daily budget and eat accordingly so that I don‚Äôt over indulge. Now down 7 lbs in just 11 days, I‚Äôm well on track to losing the 45 lbs that I set as my goal, and getting there sooner than expected.

Title: Highly recommend!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I used this app a year ago to shed off some weight and I use the free version. I started using this app in January of 2019 and by September I lost 60 pounds! Amazing within a few months I lost that weight. I was so impressed with this app I recommend to anyone who‚Äôs wanting to lose weight. Well I‚Äôm back on this app because the following month in October 2019 I found out I was pregnant. I used for several weeks than stopped using it. I had my son in June 2020 and he‚Äôs 4 months now; I went back on his app about 3 weeks ago and so happy to say I‚Äôve lost 11 pounds already. I need to lose an extra 20 pounds of baby weight I couldn‚Äôt lose on my own and I‚Äôm having a hard time losing, but with the help of this app it‚Äôs happening! And it‚Äôs so EASY to use!!
