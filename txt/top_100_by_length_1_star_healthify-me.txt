Title: Customer service is a joke
----------------------------------------------------------
A product is nothing without good customer service, and these guys take the icing on the cake for it. On top of multiple "technical errors",  the support usually replies after 10-20 minutes, and nobody is crazy enough to sit there for that long with an open screen. I paid 200 AUD without any clarification of the amount because on the app it said 143 dollars so i assumed i was paying the same. When i found out i requested a cancellation and refund as soon as i purchased. And there starts three days of stress and me wondering whether these guys just ripped me off of my money. No response from the customer service at all, no clarification as to where the hell my money is. As of this day, my i am still waiting for my refund. It has been three days since i requested the cancellation, which should be otherwise done on the same day if there was such a thing as good customer service.

Title: Pathetic service provider
----------------------------------------------------------
I am currently using there premium program but not getting proper assistance..each and everyone whether it‚Äôs coach or a customer care executive not giving proper guidance..if I start chatting with customer care executives they reply after long waits and also it takes whole day or sometime 2 days to resolve or reply for some questions and problems..top of them my fitness coach, whenever I schedule any call he will never be on time and only after 1 try they drop you a email that he tried and couldn‚Äôt reach me out..is this any kind of joke?..the call got disconnected after picking up the call and he is saying he couldn‚Äôt reach me..booking a call is also not a easy task..sometimes they are on leave and sometimes the call slots are not Available for whole week..investigating money on this was my biggest mistake..I will never ever subscribe this again neither recommend to anyone..

Title: Bugs
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using it since over a year. But from past few days, it keeps changing target calorie, water in take etc. So I had lost like 6.4Kgs in 108 days and my target was 72 Kgs. And today it deleted all my data, asked me to set target again. Showed that I am obese and my Ideal weight is 58.8 Kgs. Before that it was 72 Kgs. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù. Should I just vanish in air. Calorie target increased to 2600, before it was 1650, then 1800, then 1950. I am really confused. I had also talked with Customer care. My Premium worked for like 15-20 days, then vanished. Kept asking me to set my meal plans, then asked me to buy premium and when I tried that, it says you have already purchased this. I admit that this app has helped me a lot in keeping track of calorie and workouts etc, but these things keep messing up my mind. I have uninstalled it.

Title: Cheater
----------------------------------------------------------
I was using the free app. One sales executive continuously kept calling me until the time I got enrolled for a 3 months Premium membership in which it was told I will get unlimited access to 2 coaches (one fitness and one diet coach). However, it was vice-versa of that... actually, I was supposed to seek their appointment based on slot available in their schedule. Mostly they were all booked. Later after lot of request I got my coaches changed to those who are comparatively free. I lost my one month in this process. Later, the diet coach shared one diet plan (with maximum 3-4 different dishes in all meals). Just one diet plan continued till the end of the plan. {I paid more than 5000/- for a chart of 1&half page dishes) :(

Hi Yatin, This seems to be extremely distressing. Unable to get access to your coaches and change of coach without prior intimation would certainly impact your health and fitness journey. We would like to know more about what went wrong so that we can address your concern as well as make changes so that such instances do not occur. Could you please write to us at support@healthifyme.com so

Title: Not for me!
----------------------------------------------------------
The app is extremely focused on only the aspects of weight loss. Just counting calories isn‚Äôt enough, I wanted an app that would calculate my daily nutrient intake. It fails at that. No matter how much good stuff I ate, it would still calculate my calorie intake as extremely high, and then I would start getting phone calls from their team on how I can pay for a diet plan and reduce weight so they can make money. I think it‚Äôs ridiculous to play with people and their self esteem especially since I am of a lean built. Immediately uninstalled for promoting toxicity! If they consider adding a feature of daily nutrient intake and prepared an analysis for that, it would be so much more useful! Wasted opportunity

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi, We understand your concern and would like to delightfully inform you that we do have this feature where you can calculate your daily nutrient intake.

Title: Over all the view of app is good but I got this app because ...
----------------------------------------------------------
Actually I got this app because it gives data of all Indian local foods list and there nutritional content buy unfortunately it's not . To be detail iam a doctor in NTR University is measured the food nutritional values in my college laboratory my professor also measured individually but the results are too different the app shows different measures . To be understanding u measure 1gm of carbohydrates and protein give 4 calories but 1gm fat gives 9 calories . When I select egg dosa which contains carbs , proteins, fats, triglycerides, and ....... It shows 1gm is 1.5 calories . Finally if you want accurate measures how much nutritions taking think of it ..

I chose 6 months membership plan from HealthifyMe in 1259. The diet plan which I got wasn‚Äôt as expected for weight loss. I have initiated the chat to change the plan for one month. Ankita the representative she change the plan and after the changes when I asked for refund rest amount she called me nd said that I have paid 999 for 6 months and one month plan is of 799. When I explained her and showed the screenshot that i paid 1259 and one month plan is of 499 she hung up the call saying that she will check and get back. But she blocked me from chat support and there is no contact number to call customer support. Fake Service!!

Title: Very poor customer service
----------------------------------------------------------
My wife purchased a smart plan and added a paid buddy plan. The buddy plan didn‚Äôt activate on my phone. Tried getting it resolved from them for 4 days but they keep turning it to the backend team who never get in touch with you. Every time you call them they come up with a new way to delay the resolution. I gave the support team everything they needed but apparently their system does not allow it. Total waste of money and time. Why put offers if you can‚Äôt offer them real time. Really makes me wonder if these guys have paid for the ratings on the App Store and play store.

----------------------------------------------------------
I paid for the smart plan which they promote a lot and on my first call with the dietitian, she said that the plan is useless and wished me luck if I achieve my target. Very demotivating and kept pushing to purchase higher plans by paying extra. Highly unprofessional and I suggest HealthifyMe to not promote a plan in your advertisements when your staff has to call it useless as they just want to make cookie points with the employer by pushing people to pay more. Not interested in such ideas. Wish I could get the refund on my plan as well. Highly disappointed!!

I installed this app 3 days ago and I have to lose about 10 kgs of weight, i have a very active lifestyle with my workout and steps recorded in the app itself... but on day 1 it set my required calories to be 1500, on day two it went to 1200 , day 3 to 1100 and today it displays that on an entire day I am expected to eat only 1000 calories. Are you serious? When are you going to stop like on 100 cal a day? Totally unrealistic and those annoying ads to buy their plans.

Don‚Äôt waste your money on this coz they don‚Äôt refund your money if in case you decide not to continue. If you religiously follow the diet maybe you‚Äôll get results, that is if you have all the patience to follow it. I went for a smart plan which only gives me access to the diet chart and thr AI (which I haven‚Äôt used, or didn‚Äôt feel the need to do so) apart from that it does nothing else. I‚Äôd get better suggestion if I googled (if you know the right place to look for).

Title: Fake app and cheating customers
----------------------------------------------------------
I have logged into this app to understand the features. App automatically deducted amount without my consent. Immediately I have reached customer care, they promised me they will refund. Every time I write email they are marking as resolved. They are big time cheaters. Customer subscribe manager Abdul Lateef promised my issue resolved but no use.

I'm disappointed with this. The food you recommend is expensive. For the initial 2 weeks it was okay later on it became expensive food. If chose some other  food , the options are very limited. No motivation to continue with this diet. And the trainer didn't even provide my last 2 plans. Pathetic response. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

U can get such diet plans anywhere online on net, nothing new and different.

So no worth for money. And most of review are fake

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi Nukul, Our app is free for download and so are most of our critical features. Millions of our satisfied users have used these features to achieve their daily health goals. Like any genuine diet and fitness regime we do not believe in shortcuts and tracking calorie intake and daily workouts helps in creating healthy habits and in turn assists in leading a healthy lifestyle. Our diet plans are highly customized as per individual requirements so it is regrettable to think that any generic online diet plan can provide similar results. As for the reviews the numbers speak for themselves as it would be impossible for most of them to be fake. Having said this we would genuinely like to know what made you feel this way about our app so that we can assist you. However, iOS App Store does not provide us with the option to get your account details so that we can fix these issue for you despite our best intentions. We request you to please take a screenshot of the issues highlighted by you in this review and raise a chat on the app or write to us at support@healthifyme.com so that we can immediately take this up and assist you.

I paid yearly subscription. My account is still reflected as free and I am not able to access anything. I tried contacting service desk but no response received. Such service is not expected after paying so much. Horrible!!!

Title: The facilitators are rude and unprofessional
----------------------------------------------------------
They had a kiosk in my organisation. When I went to inquire about the the app, they are talking each other sarcastically and didn‚Äôt bother to give a proper response. If the marketers are rude, think about the trainers.

Title: No customer support once you paid
----------------------------------------------------------
Hidden policies and no refund in case you don‚Äôt loose, also trainers are hardly available to talk that are always booked. Plan made once is what you have to follow for like 6 months with no change.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi , We do regret the experience you had with us and would like to know more. Additionally we would like to say that we do not have any hidden policies and have a transparent structure regarding refunds. We would like to know more regarding trainer unavailability issues that you had faced as it is a critical part of service and we would like to rectify any problems if present on our end. The diet and fitness plans provided by our coaches are changed at regular intervals so we would investigate why you had to follow the same plan for a duration of 6 months. Could you please write to us at support@healthifyme.com so that we can assist you. Regards, Team HealthifyMe

They intentionally move you from one page to another page just to buy their service. Even cancelling a purchase option takes you to another discounted price page instead of just taking you back.
