Title: Magical Fun Effortless Food Accountability & Weight Loss
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve tried probably at least 15 different food/calorie counting apps so far, and I would give it my very best effort however I‚Äôd normally stop counting calories a few weeks into the process/get bored/lose motivation etc. and a lot of the time I‚Äôd even start bad habits again and over eat/go off of my plan. This Ap, since you track photos of your food AND you track your mood, why you are eating, with whom you ate, where you ate etc. makes you super aware of your eating habits but not in a time consuming, OCD, monotonous way. It‚Äôs super fun taking photos, tracking your situation and makes it so you constantly think twice before going off of your plan. It takes only minutes a day, I absolutely love the summaries of the day/week and how the photos are grouped together. They have nice graphs and info. Very nice having the journaling option with each meal. Actually prefer it doesn‚Äôt have the option to count calories in a traditional way, since I‚Äôve given up on that over and over in the past. Love if you‚Äôre fasting it shows how long. I am seriously pondering doing the full ap and purchasing a year, since I‚Äôve already lost a few pounds without barely trying! I love tracking my exercise and food together so I‚Äôm highly thinking this ap would motivate me to exercise more too! I‚Äôve already recommended this to my Mom and she absolutely loves it too, and is having fun with it and success. I greatly recommend you give it a try, as the free option is a hundred times more helpful than any other ‚Äúfree‚Äù ap I‚Äôve ever done. No annoying pop ups or Ads, no pressure purchase full one. The full one is fairly affordable for all you get imo. Amazing thank you, I feel healthier, more empowered to make positive change, and slimmer by the day!

Title: The little things are big...
----------------------------------------------------------
After YouFood ended, I was lost. I loved taking pics of my food to keep a journal, but at some point, I realized that habitually taking the photo just became habit and I always wished for more.  So far, it seems that ‚ÄúAte‚Äù has it.  First, as simple s concept as it is, I love, love, love the on and off path option. Actively saying that I am ‚Äúon path‚Äù is an motivatorüòá that I did not anticipate. Likewise, who wants to admit that they‚Äôre ‚Äúoff path‚Äù ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è? I also love the integration of my water and exercise efforts as well. I‚Äôve only been doing it for three days, so I haven‚Äôt really gotten into all of the other benefits but I also like the idea of tracking why I eat, whether I eat at home or out, how the meal was prepared, how I was feeling when I ate and a big one...who I ate with üòâ!  I have a feeling that in time, I‚Äôm going to see some real trends that will expose for me why I eat the way I eat and more importantly how much I eat. Aside from always saying ‚ÄúI just love food‚Äù, that‚Äôs a question that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve truly figured out just yet.  Now, I just need to find some friends for more accountability.  I‚Äôm trying the upgrade and had marked my calendar to cancel after 14 days, planning to be unfulfilled, but I know already that I‚Äôm in.  Yearly plan paid for.  Wish me luck!  P.S.  I swear I‚Äôm not a developer or a friend or family member of theirs and I can prove it.  Just try it and see for yourself!  üòÇüòÇ

Title: Best food logging app ever
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been logging my food for about 2 years now, and this is the best method I've ever used. For over a year, I logged all my calories and macros with apps like my fitness pal, Fitbit, cronometer, and a few others. I never really enjoyed logging food that way. Eventually I realized that I had gained enough intuition about the nutrients of my food that I no longer needed to track macros to reach my goals, but I still wanted to log to keep me mindful of the way I ate. I tried at least 3 other picture logging apps, a written journal where I described my meals, and a photo journal without an app. This is far better than any other thing I tried for a few reasons: 1. It only takes two taps to log a meal. This allows you to actually enjoy your eating rather than try to count every calorie and macro/micro nutrient 2. It is easy to visualize your day of eating 3. The simple reflection options for the meals are helping me to evaluate my eating in a more holistic way, rather than just looking at nutritional content 4. Great for intermittent fasting 5. The interface is very ascetically pleasing and intuitive. I really love the simplicity of on/off path, however, if you've never logged your food before and your goal is weight/fat loss, I'd suggest tracking calories/macros for at least a few days so that you can have a more educated idea of what's on/off path for you.

Thanks for the review. Happy to hear that you are enjoying our app. One of our main reason for building it is that we got frustrated with calorie counting apps. Although it does help to learn portions early on, in the long term, you can go without it and avoid all the frustration. Regarding your suggestions, we are actually working on all of those. They are on our roadmap and should be released in a few months. Thanks again and enjoy your journey!

Title: Most useful and efficient food tracking
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve tried myfitnesspal calorie counting, daily photo journals, and also just writing out the food but the interface of this app is aesthetically pleasing and visually appealing as well as directed. The option to chose ‚Äúoff path‚Äù or ‚Äúon path‚Äù with the reminder of what your current goal is at the top of the screen is brilliantly simple and helps me to minimize obsessive food thoughts like ‚ÄúI ate so bad I‚Äôm so fat‚Äù or ‚Äúi ate an apple today so that makes up for the ice cream and chips and cookies I ate the rest of the day‚Äù etc etc. It even lets you make a collage of your food pictures at the end of the day, which is a perfect way to visualize what you‚Äôre putting into your body. Oh, and you can track calories in the comments under your picture but you can also track where you ate, if you ate alone or with people, why you ate, and how it made you feel which is a genius way to help people make the lifestyle change into eating healthier (instead of forcing yourself to eat ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô foods you despise you can focus on the healthy foods you adore). I‚Äôve been searching for an app like this for years and I‚Äôm very happy I‚Äôve finally come across it. I hope to use it for a while, and I really appreciate that it‚Äôs a free app with no ads. Hands down my favorite health app.

Title: A Handy, Easy Way to Track your Food
----------------------------------------------------------
7/29/17 Update: It's been almost two months now since I've had the app.  I am raising my rating to a 5 star because 1. I see now how the app helps me to be fully transparent with my eating habbits without any guilt in my recording what I am tracking.  In a very useful way it helps me to honestly confront my behavior and then I can look at how I feel, times of day and make modifications to that behavior with some self descipline.   One thing that I do have challenges with is the apps ability to update my iPad and iPhone with new entries.  I have found there to be a signifcant lag time, sometimes several days without an update of the meals I have recorded on one being shown on the other.  I spoke with the team and they are going to address this wth one of the future updates.  I still believe this is worthy of 5 stars and has proven to be the type of food tracking took that is easy to use and one that I will continue to use.  Oh, by the way my conversation with the tech support people was very plesant and they genuinely seemed interested in my concerns.  That is a big plus as well.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the review. Happy to hear that you like the app. We are actually planning on adding user customizable after meal questions and some other cool features around that area. Coming in a later release. Until then, we occasionally add new options as users ask for it. (Like the "Raw" option, recently added.)

Title: Exactly what I was looking for!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app! I wanted a food diary thing, but don‚Äôt want to track calories or even type in every teaspoon of oil I use to cook my dinner. I love that I can quickly type something in, and the photo aspect is unexpectedly great! It‚Äôs quick to snap a picture and it motivates me to add things like fruit and vegetables to my plate since I‚Äôm visually more apt to notice that I‚Äôm skipping them and just eating a sandwich or a piece of toast. I also like the freedom to change what is ‚Äúon path‚Äù for me - since it‚Äôs not specific to one type of eating. I really love the little arrow that encourages me to make a healthier choice for my next meal if I do go off path - it‚Äôs not judgy and unlike other things I‚Äôve tried, I don‚Äôt tend to feel like I‚Äôve ‚Äúruined‚Äù a day with one meal or food, so I‚Äôm more likely to just move on and eat something that is better for me at the next meal rather than derail and start again the next day (or week or whatever!). Thanks for such a helpful tool!

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you so much! Appreciate the kind words. Photos do make a huge difference. When you add notes to your meal, you can also dictate it which makes it super easy to add some quick description of the meal and any other thoughts you feel like sharing. To dictate, just hit the little microphone icon on the keyboard. Enjoy your path!

Title: Fantastic and amazing!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is only my second day using the app but it has brought me such peace and joy.  Taking photos of my meals felt strange to me at first but what I realized is that it really promotes mindfulness and reflection.  You can make notes that go along with the picture, creating a new kind of ritual practice that slows down your meal nicely and easily.  I like all the tracking in terms of hunger level, satisfaction, etc.  But perhaps my favorite thing of all are the ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù you get to try.  The one I chose to start with is to take 2 deep breaths before eating.  Even that simple act allows me to connect to my body and spirit so that I can listen to my physical and emotional needs.  My lifelong struggle with stress eating has been exasperated due to the COVID-19 situation.  I didn‚Äôt want to spiral back down into the overeating so I found this app. I couldn‚Äôt be happier, calmer, or feeling more grounded around food.  Thank you to the creators and developers!!!

Title: Perfect for my needs
----------------------------------------------------------
I have downloaded every meal tracker app available on the App Store it seems, but nothing was exactly what I was looking for in till I found ate. I just need a simple place where I can write down or take a picture of what I‚Äôm eating, which is enough to keep me ‚Äúon path‚Äù without the stress of calorie counting, trying to search a weird database for what I ate, entering the exact quantities of what I ate, or having to report to a health coach. The design of this app is pleasing, it‚Äôs easy to use, I like the questions they ask you after your meal so you can reflect on whether you made a good choice or not and why. I‚Äôm grateful to the makers of this app for understanding that not everybody wants to spend their entire life counting calories, even if we still want to be healthy. Thank you! I am strongly considering a subscription, but the free version has everything that I really need, so don‚Äôt let that scare you off from downloading it :)

Title: Super helpful and easy to use!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using ate for the past week with a group of friends in an effort to take better care of our bodies this year and practice more mindfulness with our eating.  The benefits are already so evident.  Having to actually document what, when, and how much you are eating really makes me think twice before eating too much or eating things that aren‚Äôt as good for me, which are 2 big goals for me.  Also, because my friends and I follow each other on the app, it‚Äôs actually EXCITING to take a picture of my home-cooked, healthy meals or any other instances where I‚Äôm making good food choices!  I have also loved tracking how eating made me feel, which is one of the questions the app asks you after your meal.  Tracking my meals is quick and easy, which is important to me, and I‚Äôm going to keep using ate!  Highly recommend if you‚Äôre like me and struggle sometimes with being mindful with your eating!

Title: Motivating!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have only been using this app for one week, but I love it so far!This app is so motivational! I have set a path to focus on eating small healthy meals throughout the day- choosing a variety of veggies,fruits and healthy protein! I love how easy it is to snap a picture to log my eating. I can easily see what and how often I ate throughout the day. Stopping to take a photo before I eat something really makes me more thoughtful about what I put in my body. I have also loved plating  my food to make a ‚Äúpretty‚Äù picture - instead of snacking out of a bag, I take the time to plate my snacks now! It‚Äôs actually fun! I love the questions that are asked after eating- I have really focused now on eating at a table not on the couch or in the car.  I rarely eat with my phone or while watching TV, I enjoy my food and listen to my body more when I feel satisfied- rather than stuffed or the bowl is empty!

Title: Perfect Balance
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve tried every diet on the planet. I used to think it was fun tracking my macros. In the end it‚Äôs nothing but a obsession & for  WHAT? Possibly losing a couple pounds, weighing & measuring everything only to eat dinner at a friends house & blow the whole thing. Let‚Äôs face it that‚Äôs no fun. So I tried keto no thanks, next OMAD with no restrictions that was the best so far however I found myself overeating & hungry by mid afternoon & obsessing over dinner. I‚Äôm one of those people who like to try different ways to eat and I have a love- hate relationship with tracking it. I found this app & I'm still intermittent fasting using a more intuitive approach & making my first afternoon meal smaller then I can have a normal size dinner & I‚Äôm not starving. Taking pictures is perfect because I can get a visual which honestly is more than sufficient to see how I‚Äôm doing. This app is Awesome!!

Title: It‚Äôs ALL about mindful eating.
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been using the app for about a week now.  Formerly I was using My Fitness Pal and sometimes WW.  The thing I like about the Ate app is that it totally makes you think about what you‚Äôre putting into your mouth.  You‚Äôre mindful in a way I never was with those other apps.  It also makes me feel totally in control of what I‚Äôm eating and makes me feel powerful.  I like that I‚Äôm not tied to a calorie number.  When I was tied to a number, I‚Äôd find myself eating things just because I had calories ‚Äúleft‚Äù in the day.  Now, I‚Äôm more likely to focus on whether I‚Äôm actually hungry or not.   That‚Äôs sort of the key and the hardest thing for most of us that struggle with weight.  If we could just stop eating as soon as we aren‚Äôt hungry anymore, then no one would be overweight.   That thought is life changing but very difficult to actually do when a donut is staring you in the face!

Title: Simple in all the right ways
----------------------------------------------------------
I heard about this app from a nutrition coach who uses it with some of her clients. I struggle to use food diaries because I am on the go constantly at work, frequently eating two meals at the office, often with colleagues around, and often I can‚Äôt prepare them. So the idea that I can stop, write down a bunch of stuff, look up its nutritional values, etc, has never worked. Enter Ate. You can snap a picture of your food with two clicks (one to open the app, one to shoot), and it‚Äôs already at an appropriate angle to capture your plate so it‚Äôs very discreet too. Then click once more for whether it‚Äôs on or off your ‚Äúpath‚Äù and you‚Äôre done. You can write in things you forgot and I really like the simple questions you can answer to add detail. I haven‚Äôt used all the features yet but I am starting with being able to capture 100% of my food each day, which is a great success.

Title: Easy, User-Friendly, Intuitive, and Fast
----------------------------------------------------------
I don't usually take the time to leave reviews for apps but I feel this app really deserves it. Not only is the app really easy to use with a user-friendly interface and intuitive design, the creators are really easy to reach with questions and suggestions. I received a reply within hours on a Sunday, even when it said they wouldn't reply until Monday. The reply was friendly, professional, and addressed my suggestion. The app has thought of a lot of things that you would like to have in a journaling app, such as why you're eating, where you're eating, and how you feel after eating it. The best part is, these are all optional, or easily added later, if you are pressed for time. I highly recommend this app for those who are looking to find trends in their eating patterns but who don't want to enter each and every ingredient or count calories.

Title: Finally!
----------------------------------------------------------
I really love this app. I needed a way to watch and be aware of my eating that didn‚Äôt make me feel restricted, guilty, controlled or so seriously eating disordered that I became paralyzed and consumed by fear. I know what to do, but totally resist being ‚Äú told‚Äù or managed by someone else. This app lets me choose MY path and focus on what I know I want to work on. There is no frowny face or judgement when I wobble... just a little jog in my path. Photographing my meals instead of entering what I ate one by one on a list totally works for me and gives me a visual way to see if I ate enough color during the day. There is no target other than on path or off,  and a percentage that I can improve on tomorrow. When I‚Äôm at a loss for what to eat, I‚Äôve got a whole gallery of previous meals I can refer to. Thanks for making my food life easier!

Title: The only food tracking app I have consistently used with success
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is a game changer and I‚Äôm so happy I found it. I have struggled with binge eating and an unhealthy relationship with food for the better part of my life. The app is like a picture food journal that lets me track what I eat and the emotions that go along with it. In turn my entire perspective on eating has changed and I have developed a healthy and mindful eating pattern. If you are struggling with disordered eating this is the app you‚Äôre looking for. Even if you‚Äôre just trying to loose weight and be mindful of what you eat THIS IS THE APP YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. I have tried other food tracking apps and they don‚Äôt compare to this one. It‚Äôs super helpful too that they give you a day ‚Äúrecap‚Äù where you can see what you ate and what you were feeling/why you ate at the time. This will help anyone‚Äôs fitness journey. üòä

Title: Down 17lbs and counting
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is amazing. I‚Äôm someone who has tried EVERY diet and fitness app out there and nothing has been as effective as this app. I‚Äôve lost 17lbs since I started using the app a little over a month ago and I‚Äôm still losing. The best part is you can customize your goals for you, you aren‚Äôt forced to eat or not eat any foods. I‚Äôm still eating whatever I want, but the mindfulness questions for every meal are helping me realize what foods make me feel good. If I get off track of the path I created for myself, it isn‚Äôt the end of the world and I don‚Äôt binge on ice cream like I would with other diets. I just try to be more mindful during the next meal. Mindfulness really is key to being able to make smart choices in any situation, and I‚Äôm so grateful for this app! THANK YOU FOR YOUATE, DEVELOPERS! It really works!

Awesome! Congrats on the 17lbs. So happy to hear that app is working for you. All the success we are hearing back from our users is really motivating us on making the app even better. Our goal was to build something that truly transforms people's lives. It's exciting to see it actually happen. Even ourselves. I have lost around 60lbs and been keeping it off. :) Mindful eating and the app works for both loosing and maintaining. :) Let us know if there is anything you would like to see in the app. Enjoy your path!

Title: Great for binge eaters
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app! I had fitness pal and other calorie counting apps but I will always forget to record what I ate. Taking the pic before each meal it‚Äôs so much easier to remember. Not only that it helps me to see how much I‚Äôve been eating I love that I can scroll and see if I had sugar that week and it gets you to the root of your problem. So every time you snap a pic you can add tags of how that meal made you feel and the app creates pie graph of why you eat. I also like that it gives you the time in between each meal perfect if this is important for your type of diet like a fasting diet. So there is no way to track calories and I don‚Äôt mind bucease for me now portion control is what i need so this works great I want to upgrade but i don‚Äôt know if is it worth it. But i love it so far

----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve always hated logging what I eat because it‚Äôs too tedious, time consuming & detailed. But YouAte makes it so quick & easy. All you have to do is snap a quick pic. Even if you don‚Äôt enter it that moment you can go back whenever, import the pic & it will automatically enter the time you took the pic. I love the reflection questions as well that help you think more about why and how you‚Äôre eating. It also has a pie graph to show you how much of your eating is for what reasons & it keeps great stats on how much time you go between meals. The layout is simple and attractive. This app makes food journaling/logging/tracking so much fun! You can even share it with friends to keep each other accountable & encourage friends in eating better! LOVE that! Everyone should be using this app!

Title: Useful, simple, insightful
----------------------------------------------------------
It‚Äôs a simple app to use, which makes it so convenient to be consistent with. Snap a picture, enjoy your meal, and come back to reflect on what you‚Äôve eaten. Do it enough times throughout the day and at the end of the day, you can look back at everything you've eaten. It really gives you a reality check (if you‚Äôre good about photographing everything you eat) on how you eat throughout the day. It‚Äôs a great tool to have at your disposal if you‚Äôre aiming to be a more conscious eater, without the mental stress that calorie counting apps might give you. It really has you focus more on the quality of foods you eat and if those align with your food goals, rather than simply eating anything (healthy or not) as long as it meets a calorie amount at the end of the day.

Title: Painless (and fun!) awareness
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded this app instead of going to calorie counting or a fad diet (both of which I was considering). It‚Äôs been wonderful! I can easily snap a photo of my meals and there‚Äôs a fun and encouraging component to getting to capture my choices. It makes me want to make BETTER choices. You get to retroactively log why you ate, where you ate and how you felt which has given me an overall better awareness of my eating habits and I‚Äôve since been able to cut back eating when I‚Äôm bored and not hungry. It‚Äôs helps promote self compassion because you can always get back on path if you choose an off path meal or snack. Lastly, I get to see my stats week to week, like how ‚Äúon path‚Äù I‚Äôve been towards the goals I got to set and how much time I usually go between meals.

Thank you for choosing us! Painless and fun is what we were shooting for. :) Mindfulness is so important! It is surprising how often we eat when we are not hungry. I was that way all the time. Now I am learning. Happy to hear that it's helping you too. It's amazing how easily you can make better choices once you are truly aware of your eating habits. Enjoy your path!

Title: ate (8) out of five stars üòâ
----------------------------------------------------------
This is one of my all-time favorite apps. Instead of tracking calories, taking pictures has made it so much easier to think about why and how I am eating. It makes me more likely to eat because I‚Äôm hungry, than eat because I have calories left for the day. The creators of ate have obviously put so much thought into designing this app, and it shows! I love looking back at pictures of what I ate in previous days (and I like making my plates look pretty too!). The graphs of how you have been eating are so helpful, and they have every kind of graph that I could want to see. I talked my mother into doing it with me, and it‚Äôs been a blast to see what she‚Äôs eating from her point of view. Thank you so much for this app, developers! I would highly recommend it. üçè

I‚Äôve been on one diet or another since I was a teenager, losing and regaining the same 20 pounds over and over again. Now at age 59, I am tired of devoting so much of my precious time to counting calories and obsessing over food - always feeling guilty. This app is perfect! ATE helps me to be intentional about my eating and allows for all the reasons I might choose to eat that have nothing to do with hunger or health - and decide that‚Äôs my path - right for me. I feel as though a huge burden has lifted and I‚Äôm enjoying my life and my food. ATE is like a visual diary of my day - without a score or judgement. It‚Äôs a place that allows for curiosity and wonder and honesty rather than shame and doubt. I‚Äôm learning to trust myself with the help of this app.

----------------------------------------------------------
This app is a fantastic way for you to keep track of what you‚Äôre eating in the most non-judgmental way possible. No calorie counting, no need to give excessive amount of information concerning the ingredients of what you‚Äôre eating, just a simple picture and you‚Äôre done. The on/off path feature is a great way to hold yourself accountable without shame. Once you take a picture you can click on it and fill out information of where you‚Äôre eating and how you‚Äôre feeling, among other questions. Only thing I would ask for is that you can add more words in this section. Sometimes I eat when I‚Äôm anxious but it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm stressed. But it‚Äôs a minor thing. I truly love this app and I really appreciate how mindful it‚Äôs made me when it comes to my meals.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Happy to hear that it helped you become more mindful. We will be introducing custom answers in the future. In the meantime, let me see if I can add anxious.

Title: It‚Äôs just right!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love the flexibility of this app! As a person who struggles with disordered eating but has other health issues that require I ‚Äúwatch what I eat,‚Äù this app is a perfect way to see what I‚Äôm eating and then make adjustments according to how I feel. I don‚Äôt want to count calories or measure things. I don‚Äôt need any kind of guilt layered on how much I already beat myself up. I just want to be able to look back and know what I ate. I want to collect data. I set up my goal to be ‚Äúsee my food‚Äù so that I‚Äôm 100% on the path all the time. Every now and then I forget the photo before I eat the food, but I‚Äôm able to just enter the text. The app is neither overly cute nor clinical. Ate passes the Goldilocks test: ‚Äúit‚Äôs just right.‚Äù Thank you, Piqniq!

Title: Fun
----------------------------------------------------------
I picked up this app on a lark more to keep a diary of the amazing food my partner has been cooking up during quarantine than to diet. I set my goal to ‚Äúyum yum yum yum.‚Äù But since I‚Äôve started using it, I realize that it does help me keep track of my portion sizes and how often I‚Äôm eating things I need to reduce, like sweets. The interface is easy to use, and I‚Äôve yet to run into a problem. Moreover, there are no ads and the entire thing is very tastefully done ‚Äî some apps feel like cynical cash grabs which are intentionally unpleasant to use. This app is the very opposite of that. It‚Äôs, dare I say it, relaxing? Can you really call a food diary app relaxing? Somehow it really is! It‚Äôs just a really positive experience: give it a try.

Title: amazing!
----------------------------------------------------------
My boyfriend has been trying to get my to keep track of my diet for years, and he uses my fitness pal. I personally dislike my fitness, I‚Äôm fairly healthy and I just got sad over the calorie counting. BUT THIS APP IS AMAZING. It really just makes you think more so about WHAT you‚Äôre eating and making you really thing about what you SHOULD eat over typical alternatives. It‚Äôs super user friendly, and it‚Äôs much more of a simplistic healthy mentality of just choosing healthier meals. AND I LOVE THE GOALS YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM AND TBE OPTIONS TO MAKE YOUR OWN.  Plus I convinced my friends do it with my, which makes it more fun to share the healthy meals we‚Äôve been eating! (the only downside is water tracking is part of the premium version)

Title: Loving this App!
----------------------------------------------------------
After trying out a few apps where you have to laboriously enter every item you eat, I found that to be to time consuming & realized I didn‚Äôt care about calories & pie charts that didn‚Äôt really seem on target.  What I really wanted was an online food journal to track what I ate daily.  Although I‚Äôve only been using the app for a couple of weeks I‚Äôm really enjoying the ease of just snapping a pic & moving on with my day.  You can go back in & rate your meals with a Q&A section, if you choose.  If I do think about eating something unhealthy I‚Äôve asked myself if I really want that pic in my daily recap.  It‚Äôs a small thing, but it does make you stop & think.  All in all,I‚Äôm enjoying the app &definitely plan on continuing to use it.

Title: Great app and great management!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have never reviewed an app before, so that tells you something right off the bat. I have loved the ease in this app. Meal tracking has always stressed me out. I hate measuring things. My meals are too elaborate to traditionally track. Being able to snap a picture (which I usually already do anywaysüòÇ #foodblog) and add a description makes ‚Äútracking‚Äù so much easier! I‚Äôm able to share this app with my nutritionist and she can have an idea of what I am eating in a day without me having to track. The summary questions have allowed me to have a much better relationship with my meals, realizing trends and habits that I may not have realized before. It forces me to slow down and ask myself these important questions. I love it.

Helping you transform your relationship with food is what we strive for.

Title: So lovely and effortless.
----------------------------------------------------------
First off, no calorie counting! That‚Äôs the main reason I appreciate this app. In my experience, counting calories doesn‚Äôt work. I forget all about what a ‚Äúmeal‚Äù is and don‚Äôt think about what I want. But with this app, I get to be simple, crate meals I will enjoy and even make them presentable since I know I‚Äôm going to take a photo for my journal. Also, it really has a beautiful interface! I love the color scheme. What‚Äôs nice is the app encourages you to decide for yourself whether your ‚Äúon path‚Äù or ‚Äúoff path‚Äù and to evaluate you reasons for eating each meal, how you feel, and how the food was. Just a simple and helpful way to watch what you eat without obsessing over calories. I am glad they made YouAte! Thanks you guys!

Title: The best food tracking app
----------------------------------------------------------
This is the best app I‚Äôve used for tracking what I eat. For people recovering from an eating disorder, this app is very helpful. It promotes intuitive eating, mindfulness, and accountability. I like the photo tracking method because it makes me want to eat food that is visually appealing, like a pretty salad, instead of just eating a bag of chips or something. It also helps me track the frequency of my meals really easily and non judgmentally (some apps pressure you to eat more frequently, which is really difficult when you are in recovery). It is nice to find an eating app that has nothing to do with calories or weight. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to track their eating in a healthy way.

Title: So simple it works
----------------------------------------------------------
Simple and perfect! I‚Äôve tried similar apps and what makes this one stand out is that it doesn‚Äôt take up exorbitant storage space. This will make you reflect on why you ate and how you feel about it, removing any judgement and not imposing any limits. This works for me: If I‚Äôm setting the rules then I‚Äôm responsible for following the rules. It‚Äôs helped me overcome overeating. It has made me aware of timing of meals for intermittent fasting. The company seems respectful of users, in thoughtful app design and limited emails that you can opt out of. If it‚Äôs not a functionality, it‚Äôd be nice to see stats like how many meals I was bored, percentage of meals in the car. Otherwise, great app, recommended 110%.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi Chris, Thanks for the great review. Our goal with the app was to be non-judgmental and to make sure it was easy and fun to use. Since you know your own circumstances and your own goals, our goal was to help, but not try to take over control. Sounds like this works for you. Regarding the stats, they are absolutely on our roadmap! We have a few more things to build out before we get to them, but they are coming and of course will show all your existing history, so keep filling out those questions. Let us know is you have any suggestions or questions.

Title: Love this easy to use app
----------------------------------------------------------
This is app is wonderful! It‚Äôs so easy to use, all you do is take a picture or type in what you ate, say if its on path or not, then say how it made you feel! I like that i can see how my day went and that I don‚Äôt have to count calories. I‚Äôve tried a lot of different food tracking apps and most are complicated to keep track of everything. This makes me feel like I‚Äôm in control and I don‚Äôt let a silly number of calories I‚Äôm allowed a day control me. Seeing that I ate something good for me makes me want to eat something healthy again, if i ate something not so good then i know at my next meal to step it up and make it a good choice! I would like to see more options under how did it make you feel.

Title: Great app
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app for maybe a week or so. Before finding Ate, I tested multiple fasting apps and nothing worked well or was set up good. I don‚Äôt even think I want to fast for the reasons on other apps. This app is GREAT. I‚Äôve always taken pictures of my food and saved them, especially when I cook a meal or fix a healthy breakfast for example. Ate allows me to see what I eat in a day and it lets me record how it made me feel (I LOVE this part of the app because I struggle with how food makes me feel). I also love that it adds options such as ‚Äúwho did you eat with?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere did you eat?‚Äù Overall this app seems perfect for me and I hope I continue to use this to track my food habits.

Title: Building a healthy relationship with food!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve struggled with an unhealthy view of food for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôve tried multiple ‚Äúfad‚Äù diets... and all failed, of course. None of them focused on fixing the real issues. Calorie counting, macro tracking, etc just exacerbates obsessive thoughts for me to the point I just give up and feel miserable. But this app! I‚Äôm so happy to have found it. I needed a photo food journal, for accountability, but this app has so much more. The questions help you dig into the important stuff...why am I eating? This has helped me watch my level of emotional eating and pay attention to my hunger signals, which is critical for intuitive eating. Thanks to the Ate team. Keep up the great work!

Are you ‚ÄúOn Path‚Äù? It‚Äôs a simple question, but it answers everything in a nutshell. I‚Äôm not great about taking the photos but I always log with the text feature. This app came to me at the perfect time. I‚Äôm listening to ‚ÄúPhit N Phat podcast and they highly recommend journaling. This app is a perfect way for me to track my eating and my eating habits. I‚Äôm having a health issue unrelated to weight and/or weight loss. I‚Äôm trying to track down what the trigger is and if it is in fact food related. Journal is definitely helping me align my symptoms with what I have been consuming. And I am getting better about taking pictures. It‚Äôs so quick, then I can put my phone away and enjoy my meal.

Title: This app changed everything for me!
----------------------------------------------------------
Such a simple concept. That we don‚Äôt need to count calories to lose weight. That by simply looking at photos of what we‚Äôve eaten, we can instantly tell if we‚Äôve eaten too much or just enough, and if what we‚Äôre eating consists of nutrition-packed calories or empty calories. I‚Äôve lost 9 pounds so far, am absolutely not on a diet, do not feel deprived, and have never eaten better! Having to take a picture of everything I eat greatly encourages me to choose colorful, healthy options, pay more attention to portion sizes, and to think twice about whether I really want to eat something. It‚Äôs also very reinforcing to look back at my food choices and feel proud of them. I love this app!

i am on a mission to mindful eating. i don‚Äôt want to diet, change my body, etc. i do want to feel physically better and to be intentional about what i eat. Ate was a godsend in a world full of calorie counting (or ‚Äúmacro‚Äù counting, same difference). i love that i can be accountable to myself without measuring myself. and i‚Äôve only been using it about a week but it‚Äôs already helping me begin to pause before mindlessly grazing off my toddler‚Äôs plate or out of a bag of chips. so i can enjoy my snacks and meals by taking a second to put them on a plate or at least to snap a photo before putting them in my mouth. i hope apps like ate are future of nutritious, body positive eating :)

I highly recommend this app for anyone who wants to be more aware of what they‚Äôre eating throughout the day and the times they eat. It‚Äôs a great first step towards a lifestyle change and helps keep you accountable for what you‚Äôre eating, how much, and how it makes you feel. I feel inclined to make better decisions already! I am 19 and with school, work, and social activities it can be easy to fall off track or keep snacking, but with this app it has helped me to be more disciplined and focus on portion control. I wouldn‚Äôt want a bunch of pictures of unhealthy, prepackaged foods on my path. I love this app a lot and I‚Äôm excited to see the results it helps me to achieve.

Mindfulness is the key to any attempt and/or success in changing behavior, and YouAte is the perfect app for focusing your attention. I have had an unhealthy relationship with food for a long time. In fact, it borders on addiction and obsessiveness. With YouAte, I love just snapping a picture of what I‚Äôm eating and in the moment assessing how I feel about the meal. No more counting points or writing every single thing down. Also, because I am a competitive person, I don‚Äôt want to go ‚Äúoff path‚Äù, so this helps keep me on the straight & narrow. I‚Äôm still using the free app because this is working for me.  If you are a ‚Äúvisual‚Äù person, I guarantee you will love this app!

This is a great food journal app - whether you want details or just a quick picture to remind you of what you‚Äôve ate it‚Äôs perfect. I personally need a simple tracker of what I‚Äôm eating. I don‚Äôt need to document every single calorie or carb, but I do want to keep track of what I‚Äôm eating. The pictures make it simple too. Plus you can go back and choose why you ate it, where, was it good, are you full, etc. You also get to set goals and why you‚Äôre doing this... it‚Äôs just an awesome food journal ... so much easier then others... like MyFitnessPal ‚Äî way to much freaking work! With this you have the option to add in that stuff or not and just track your food!!

I‚Äôm recovering from some disordered eating issues, and counting calories is always a big no no. However I find it very difficult to eat healthy without tracking‚Äîthis app is the perfect fit for me and way more convenient than keeping a physical food journal on me at all times. The pictures are so much better than measuring and counting every little thing in the foods I make at home. I‚Äôve already lost half an inch around my waist in around 9 days because of this apps support of my mindful eating. So thrilled I happened upon this app and i recommend it to anyone struggling to make the right food choices. Staying on path feels so good and so easy with Ate!

It tracks fasting times, allowing me to delete an app I previously used. I upgraded to the premium , much cheaper than other food premium apps, which allows me to track liquids and activities. It syncs seamlessly with my Apple health info.  So very easy to use. The support staff responds very quickly with any questions. Well done!

Title: The BEST food journal app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I LOVE this app! I am working with a nutritionist who wanted me to take photos of what I was eating. I find that I am way more honest with (and actually remember) what I eat with this app. I especially love how you can document the when, where, and why with the photo. And, a REALLY helpful feature is that it documents frequency/time between eating...with summaries at the end of each day. I would love it if this tied to my other calorie tracking food journal (myfitnesspal), but I totally don‚Äôt mind documenting in two worlds either...one is visual/emotional documentation, the other is more data driven. GREAT idea...I rave about this app a ton!

I‚Äôve struggled with my weight most of my life. I tried all kinds of diets and programs throughout the years. What I LOVE about this app is that I can food journal without the soul-crushing experience of having to add quantities and calories and search for foods online and measure and weigh everything!! That always sucked all the joy out of eating for me! Having a visual record of what I ate is a game-changer (and I‚Äôm middle-aged so I‚Äôve played ALL the games before üòÅ). It has made me more mindful and it has simplified everything. I‚Äôm down about 5 pounds in just a few days. I just really love the way this works for me! üòÉüòçüòÅ

Title: The Best Food Diary!
----------------------------------------------------------
My husband and I started a new eating and exercise program which includes recording your daily food intake. On the first day we we're manually recording our meals when I discovered this app. With the snap of your camera you can photograph what you ate and even make notes. It times the gaps between meals too. If you forgot to snap a photo you can add a text entry with the note and time. The only thing I haven't figured out is how to add a photo after the fact with the right time (I accidentally took a pic outside the app and couldn't log it in ). That is a small thing in exchange for the convenience of the food diary.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the review. Happy to join the two of you on your new healthy journey. The ability to change the time of an imported photo is coming in a future release. Right now, it uses the original time the photo was taken.

----------------------------------------------------------
I think I‚Äôm probably in the same boat as everyone else as far as trying tons and tons of other food diaries and not enjoying them. Counting calories is such a tedious and daunting task. I hate feeling bad about what I eat. This app is designed to remind us that we are human and food is meant to be enjoyed and remembered. My favorite feature of the app is the notes/Q&A within your food logs. The Q&A doesn‚Äôt ask for calories, nutritional facts or anything of the sort. It just simply wants to know what did you eat and how did it make you feel. Definitely recommending this app to friends and colleagues! Thank you, Ate!

I‚Äôve been on the diet roller coaster forever and recently wanted to try intuitive eating. I found this app by searching the App Store for Intuitive Eating and I have been blown away by how much this app has helped me stay on track! You simply take photos of everything you eat and at the end of the day you can see a collage of everything you ate that day. You can also easily note your hunger level, where you ate, mood/satisfaction after eating along with your photo. It‚Äôs so easy to log meals and so effective for keeping me honest and on track. I‚Äôve been logging for a week now and have already lost 3 lbs! Great app!

My wife and I started using the app at the suggestion of our nutritionist. We struggle with portion control and food choices and she suggested ‚ÄúAte‚Äù as a way to log our portion sizes as well as what we‚Äôre eating. Neither of us like to write down every little thing in a food log, but taking a photo of our plate whenever we eat makes it easy! We think it‚Äôs a success so far for us because it‚Äôs a gentle reminder at meal times when we take that photos to moderate and make better choices. Plus the ability to share our timelines with each other as well as our nutritionist makes it easy to get support and encouragement.

So, I‚Äôm struggling with emotional eating. Just stopping and reflecting on my feelings about my meals through the ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù pop up, which asks questions like where you were, who with, restaurant and hunger level. Just seeing what I‚Äôm eating and understanding the feelings that food gives (or not) is helping my underlying issues with why I‚Äôm eating outside of hunger. It‚Äôs also helping me healthily transition away from calorie counting and just looking at how much food I‚Äôm consuming and how often. It‚Äôs been a week and I love it. I feel so much more in tune with my emotions and less prone to eat because of stress.

Traditional calorie-counting apps have caused my eating habits to become disordered in the past, but I also struggle with accountability if I don‚Äôt keep track at all. Ate is simple enough that I don‚Äôt get lost in grams and macros, but open-ended enough that I can really set and track any goal for myself. The UI is gorgeous and intuitive. It has a crazy amount of different options and not a lot of flipping through menus trying to find those options. I‚Äôm honestly considering buying a premium subscription because I love the amount of thought put into this app even though I don‚Äôt need any of the premium features

----------------------------------------------------------
The app works best with people in your group to share and discuss options. The interface with your friends could be improved, where a comment could be shared or recipe by text or by url, on the same page as the picture.  However, I love the fact that it is not about calories.  If calories in vs calories out was truly that simple, than it would be that simple to change a lifestyle just as simple.  People are catching on that other factors play a bigger role and research is supporting these finds.  Ate is ahead of most trackers at this time, at the forefront of modern dietary thinking.  Great work!

A couple of weeks ago I was searching for a meal tracking app because I didn‚Äôt want to count calories but I still wanted to keep track of what I was eating. I tried SHYE but I didn‚Äôt like the lack of flexibility with meals and that you have to pay to save your meals after a certain date. Ate is much more flexible and gives a great visual representation of your food. I also like that I can write notes about my food and choose the circumstances and emotions I felt at the time of eating. This allows me to look back on my day and see what can be improved (or just drool over all the good food I ate!)

Also I find it helpful when I can‚Äôt think of what to cook or my husband wants a meal I made previously - I just scroll up on my logs to help me remember the meal/ingredients. One thing that I think could be improved is when you go to your day recap if you posted more than one photo within the time frame it only shows one of those photos in the recap rather then the full recap of every photo taken. Could you guys adjust this please?! Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è

What a wonderful way to food-journal, make notes about my feelings & eating habits, and stay self-motivates, without the self-judgement I often feel from forget food-journaling apps! :) I feel like ‚ÄúAte‚Äù address my total well-being, not just calorie-counting, macros, & exercise, but also my emotions, eating habits, and goals on a much deeper level. And I love that it‚Äôs photo-based; Makes tracking everything so much easier cause it‚Äôs all visual! A great app for those who want better balance in life & health, not just weight loss. :)

Title: Awesome app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am so happy this app exists! I‚Äôve been trying to eat healthier, and wanted a way to track my food without stressing myself out over calories and macronutrients and all the other data food-tracking apps collate. YouAte is perfect: when I snap a pic, it makes me remember what I‚Äôm actually eating, the short reflection questions help me consider why I am choosing a particular food (and if there was a better choice I could have made), and the ‚Äúpath‚Äù set-up is guilt-free and allows me to evaluate what‚Äôs on track for me. It‚Äôs the best way to mindfully track food without tracking calories.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for the kind words. Happy to hear that YouAte is working out for you. We are overwhelmed by the response we are getting. Glad to hear that everyone else is equally frustrated with the current journaling options. Enjoy your path and let us know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Title: Finally an app that gets it!
----------------------------------------------------------
I stumbled upon the Ate app while looking for something simple to help me keep track of what I eat. I do like ‚Äúthe other‚Äù popular app but find that tracking calories hasn‚Äôt helped me. The Ate app is great for figuring out the WHY behind eating. Eating is good! Eat to live and live to eat - but do so in a way to be healthy and happy. We are all taking pictures of our food anyway, why not do it to better ourselves? It‚Äôs simple, and I think about whether I‚Äôd rather report back with picture of a donut that I ate, or a spinach omelette that fed my soul and nourished me. Well done!

Title: Great for changing behavior
----------------------------------------------------------
A month with this app and I improved my eating behavior and dropped some pounds. Like many food apps it serves to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù you just through the act of tracking (‚ÄúDo I really want to log that?‚Äù) Unlike other food tracking apps I didn‚Äôt feel a sense of ‚Äúfailure‚Äù if I blew past some calorie (or carb, or whatever) goal. It was also nice and easy to do a picture, and I found on days I did really well I felt a sense of satisfaction looking back on the day in review and seeing all that healthy food. This helped to reinforce positive behavior as opposed to eliminate ‚Äúbad.‚Äù Good app!

I love taking photos of my food anyways (especially for my insta) so this was the perfect app for me to track my daily intake. I love that it‚Äôs simple, straightforward and there‚Äôs not pressure to count calories - am I on path or my goals or not? If I ever forget to upload my photos, I can always go back later. Super simple yet effective. How did I only just find this app????? I also love all the bright fun colors and progress charts and that you can share with friends. After I finish my review, I‚Äôm going to upload a photo of my breakfast to my app - smoothie bowl anyone?

----------------------------------------------------------
My doc asked me to provide her with a food diary. I just don‚Äôt keep track well so I searched for a simple app to track what I was eating. Nothing was simple!  They all wanted vast info such as macros and carbs and calories. Then I found YouAte. I just snap a picture of my food (or enter a description if I forgot before I started shoveling)!  I just share my day with my doctor and it sends an index picture of my meals to her. The app keeps me on track because I know I don‚Äôt want to take a picture of food I should not be eating or food I‚Äôm eating due to stress or boredom.

----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this app!! I‚Äôm not a fan of calorie counters, but I‚Äôm realizing I need to be more intentional about what I‚Äôm eating. The goal of ‚Äúhappy and healthy‚Äù is perfect, and deciding whether something is ‚Äúon path‚Äù or ‚Äúoff path‚Äù towards that goal is completely up to the user. It makes me be reflective, without feeling ashamed or stressed about the exact calorie count. I‚Äôm also a big fan of all the statistics it gives me‚Äî I feel like I already have a better understanding of my eating habits and have made some important changes that I hope to maintain with this app.

This is a great app. It is easy to use offline which is a plus for me. I like how it gives different experiments to work on and challenge you. These experiments are explained and help you think in a unique way. After you eat you are given questions about why, where, whom, and the such you ate. This is a great way to track your mode, your reasons for eating and helps you become aware of your habits. I‚Äôm very pleased with Ate. The best part is that you don‚Äôt have to have the premium access to exceed. Thank you for all your hard work by making this app so user friendly.

I love so much about this app. I love that there are so many options provided for what ‚Äúon track‚Äù might look like for any individual; It‚Äôs not just a weight loss app, and it‚Äôs not tied to a particular fad diet; it is meant to help a person reach their food goals, whatever they are. I also like the little arrow that nudges me back in track. I‚Äôve used a lot of food tracking apps, and this feels the healthiest and the most sustainable. I‚Äôd love to see a report included that lets you look at a glance at how on track you‚Äôve been over over several days or weeks.

Title: Easy and helpful
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used calorie counting apps/sites off and on for years. They are absolutely soul-crushing for me. Too time-consuming to use, and they inevitably lead me towards obsessive and disordered eating. I love that this app helps me keep track of what I‚Äôm eating and make healthier choices without reducing it to meticulous number tracking. I‚Äôm not hugely consistent with using it yet, but I‚Äôm improving. I feel better when I use this regularly. Thanks for providing a simple way to help me feel better and choose wisely, without making it all about numbers.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Have you tried the Reminders feature to help you stay consistent? They are fully customizable and can remind you at a certain time of the day or after you log a meal. You can find it under Notifications in Settings. And thank you for the great review. Calorie counting is not fun and leads to so many issues. (I always compare it to doing your taxes!) Trying to use those calorie counting apps was the motivation behind starting YouAte. It's built for humans with human emotions (and life schedules). :) Enjoy your path!

I was looking for a food journal app, but tired of tracking calories or quantities. Really happy to find YouAte! As someone who thrives on accountability, I can see what my friends are eating and they can see mine (actual pictures of meals). I also love that the meal photos don‚Äôt automatically save to your phone. It‚Äôs the perfect way to visually see what you eat, but not have to spend valuable minutes of the day tracking (which was never sustainable for me). Seeing photos of what you are is a really powerful tool. Definitely motivates me.

If you‚Äôre like me, typing every morsel in a food tracking app gets old very quickly. Journaling your food in this app is quick and easy ‚Äì just take a pic and tap the on- or off-path button. You can also add more details if you choose, such as why you ate and how it made you feel afterwards, which really supports accountability. You can easily see the history of your food choices, which is very helpful. Aesthetically pleasing and straightforward UI/UX. Thank you for developing and continually updating this free, simple, and fun app!

We already enjoy trading recipes and sharing new places to eat, but Ate takes it to whole other level!

This app is a fantastic way to set healthy food goals and have accountability without counting calories or becoming obsessive with weight.

It also really has helped me stop judging when I go ‚Äúoff path‚Äù.

I also really like that it has an added layer to let me connect why, where, and how I‚Äôm feeling when I eat. It‚Äôs also customizable so if I‚Äôm feeling something not listed, I can add it to my choices.

Doesn‚Äôt shame you when you go off path, and let‚Äôs you choose what‚Äôs on or off your path for the day which lets me decide ice cream is fine and on path when I‚Äôve been eating salad all week. Love that this app encourages sustainable changes to your diet rather than crash dieting and restrictive eating/exercise regimens.

I also like that it can keeps track of why you eat something and how it makes you feel, youbthen get statistics on the main reasons you eat, etc, etc. very helpful in discovering eating patterns.

Seeing it all laid out before you really helps to put things into perspective and makes me conscious of what I‚Äôve already eaten. If you need all the bells and whistles, you‚Äôre in the wrong place.

Really this app is about mindful eating... and that‚Äôs why I love it. Oh and because it‚Äôs a snap to use! I got it because I‚Äôd like to lose a few pounds, but more importantly, I wanted to have some accountability/food diary-type method for studying my eating trends. This app is perfect for that. No, it‚Äôs not a true weight loss, calorie-counting app. But there are tons of those, and only this one (that I know of) that is really asking the core questions of WHY you‚Äôre eating, how, how did it make you feel.

Title: Dev Request - Great app but can we fix the camera permissions limits?
----------------------------------------------------------
Love the concept of this and the latest additions! I also love that it works with my Apple Watch. I would use it all the time, but I hate leaving on camera privileges for apps (I trust you guys but just think it‚Äôs a good privacy habit in general). If the app let you use it even when the camera permissions were off (say you wanted to do a text entry or just upload photos from your gallery or turn camera permission on sometimes), it would be perfect. Thanks in advance for the consideration!

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the feedback. We make sure that the camera is only active when you are using it. On iOS14 there is a green dot indicator showing when the camera is active. You will notice that as soon as you leave the camera view, we turn it off. Regarding privileges, iOS is just not setup to have that be turned on and off. You would have to visit Settings>>Privacy every time you want to track a meal. For most of our users, that is 3-5 times a day. It would be really inconvenient. So unfortunately, that is not something we can implement.

I really despise counting calories. This app is a great way to help me keep myself visually accountable based on portion control as well through writing notes about how the meal made me feel. Both mentally and physically (and if it gave my any digestive problems). I only wish they would include a special area for water consumption. It would also be extra great if there was a way to log workouts to keep track of days you end up eating more due to intense calorie burn.

Title: Love Love Love
----------------------------------------------------------
I wanted something easy and straight forward to keep track of my eating habits for my own benefit as well as my doctors. This app (the free version) allows me to do just that, snap a photo, and keep is simple - is it ‚Äúon path‚Äù or ‚Äúoff path‚Äù - you can make it more complicated and add other health and exercise components into it with the paid version but for me the beauty of YouAte is in the simplicity and detail of its user interface, very well done! Highly recommend!

Title: Easy to use! Love it.
----------------------------------------------------------
Finally a simple food diary app. Other apps are too complicated. Photos are such an easy way to track what you eat (love that photos don‚Äôt automatically save to my phone‚Äôs camera roll) plus you can write notes underneath & also keep track of how you feel afterwards. You can choose which ‚Äústeps you will take‚Äù to reach your specific goal & the app provides you with tips and a little research for each different ‚Äústep‚Äù, which is something I love. Thank you developers!

Title: Total Game Changer! üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has become a cherished part of my every meal. It helps me to be mindful of the food choices I make by gently reminding to put as much thought in my choice of food as I would my choice of clothing for the day. I am so proud of myself when I hit that ‚ÄúOn Path‚Äù button, it‚Äôs motivation in itself to make healthier choices. But even when I do go ‚ÄúOff Path‚Äù, this app obliterates the usual shame and guilt I would normally feel and helps me treat myself better.

Title: Great app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I had been tracking my food with My Fitness Pal for several years. About 6 months ago I started doing intermittent fasting. I decided I still wanted to track what I ate but wanted to take the emphasis off of calorie counting. I searched the app store and found Ate! This app is perfect! It lets me keep a record of what I eat with an easy photo and gives me the option of creating a healthy behavior to focus on. I highly recommend this app! Thanks to the creators!

Title: Great app!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have struggled with binge-eating for many years and have tried MANY different diet plans, eating apps, etc. But this very simple app has been the only one that has actually worked. You take pictures of every meal/food you eat and answer a few questions after you eat. After a day, you can spot your eating habits. After 1 week, I have already lost 5 pounds....no dieting... just being aware of my eating. I feel so much more happy about my eating and body-image!

Title: Food freedom.
----------------------------------------------------------
I never thought I'd actually find food freedom. Tracking without guilt, no calories, no good or bad, listening to hunger and honoring your cravings. I immediately stopped dieting. I've been dieting my entire adult life and I can officially throw out the books and drop the obsession. Love that I can snap a photo and go on with my life and not think about food anymore. Who wants to go through life counting calories or carbs? Not me. I'm living my life, finally!!

Title: Better than expected!
----------------------------------------------------------
Heard about this app from Phit and Phat podcast. I was more than surprised by what it offers without the add ons $$. It‚Äôs super user friendly, makes you think about your food choices via the questions they ask and only takes the amount of time it takes to take a pic to track. I love it so much that I DID pay for full use and it got even better! I‚Äôve added and removed questions and answers to meet what‚Äôs important to me. I just can‚Äôt say enough good things üòò

Title: Great app
----------------------------------------------------------
I never write reviews for apps but I‚Äôm seriously loving this one. It‚Äôs only been a few days but it‚Äôs super easy to use and it‚Äôs really helping me. I struggle with restrictive eating and binging. It‚Äôs helping me become more aware of my cycles and habits and also seeing that even if I mess up once or twice in a day I‚Äôm still doing well. I have less guilt around food. For this reason I love the photo timeline, it‚Äôs much more satisfying than a written journal.

Title: A picture is worth 1000 words
----------------------------------------------------------
I have food journaled in the past and always slack off when it comes to counting calories. It takes a good amount of effort and once you miss a few meals it‚Äôs hard to get back on track. Snapping a photo is easy. I‚Äôm able to review all of my choices quickly and know whether I‚Äôm on track or off track. I love that you can take a photo and it doesn‚Äôt store on your device. It only stores on the app. I always seem to be low on memory so that is a great feature.
