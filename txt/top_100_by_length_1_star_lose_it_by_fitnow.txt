Title: Calorie count seems WAY off
----------------------------------------------------------
My bf and I are having this app count exercise and we’ve given it permission to read our workouts from multiple sources (Pokemon Go and Apple Health via Apple Watch series 3).. is it stacking our numbers or something?? My bf’s calorie allowance was under by about 2000 calories yesterday after eating 2500 for the day. And is it even reading mine off of my watch? I work out (says I burned 493 calories on my watch) but the app still says my allowance is 1,177.. that can’t be right. Before when I entered my active/workout calories, my allowance went up.. now it says I’m going over no matter what I do (I should be under today by 350-ish, not over by 152). It’s not logging my workouts at all after I plugged my watch into it. This is very frustrating and I have tried looking it up but I’m completely confused. Is this a bug? Do I have to log calories manually even though it’s reading my workout off of my watch??? I feel pretty dumb right now bc I feel like I’m missing something obvious but these weird cell watches are beyond me. What gives? =/

Title: ⚠️ Don’t download to track KETO carbs ⚠️
----------------------------------------------------------
Unlike most other apps that have a setting to automatically display your net carbs (-fiber) with your macros, Lose it does not. Reached out to their customer service and the said to create a “carb goal”, and you can see your carbs for the day on the carbs slide. This was easier for them then saying “no” apparently and regrettably paid for the annual for my wife and I. Other apps like myfitnesspal, you can simply go into the settings and change it to display net carbs - easy peasy always displayed upon opening. With lose-it they want you to create a separate “carb goal” add it, then when opening the app, after checking your macro breakdown slide to your carb goal, open the carbs breakdown and subtract the fiber yourself EVERY SINGLE TIME. This is especially annoying if your adding your foods via barcode photos all day. So warning to anyone on KETO tracking carbs, spend your money elsewhere I haven’t opened lose it after that week once I used others. Other apps help make it routine, this one becomes another task.

Title: One Star for App I Love
----------------------------------------------------------
Why 1 star for an app I love? Yes, I love it use it daily however I only have need of the free version. I'm not adverse to paying for apps when it benefits my needs - I have several apps I pay/subscribe to. The developers of Lose It have done their best to insure I will never subscribe to Premium even if I might think it could be useful. I respect developer's right to be paid for premium features. In return I expect some level of respect from developers for my decision as to whether or not I need those features. The developers of this app have no concept of this. They've bypassed aggressive marketing and gone to all out harassment. Every single time I go to log food I'm greeted with a pop-up add to subscribe to premium. Harassment yes and I guess their way of administering punishment to those who do not subscribe. All they have accomplished with this tactic is to deepen my resolve to never move to premium. If they next decide to cripple the free version will there are other adopts out there.

Title: do not download this app
----------------------------------------------------------
this app is so unbelievably toxic and promotes disordered eating. when i had the app it made me think that if i ate more than 1,400 calories it was the end of the world. it made me think that i needed to eat things that had a lower calorie count rather than things that were actually good for me and fuel my body. it promoted me to want to burn off everything that i ate by exercise so i could have that low number of calories, rather than eating food a let it fuel my body with the nutrients that it needed. because of these poor habits i couldn’t excel in sports due to malnourishment and enjoy the foods that loved. there are so many different ways to lose weight without this app; i lost 15 pounds over quarantine after deleting this app and just listening to my body and practicing healthy habits. this app is very dangerous for young girls and boys who are self conscious or worried about their weight.

Title: New version insists on reminding you that you failed three days ago.
----------------------------------------------------------
This app used to be the best. Then, someone decided to remind users of every failure, no matter how small, for a whole week. The most recent example is the weekly calorie tracker. I'm usually over my daily target, but not by much.  I'm still losing weight. I'm winning. Now, every time I open the app, I see red. Lose it is reminding me I failed six times last week, even if I lose weight. It's depressing. This is similar to the idiotic (and thankfully removed) change of a few months ago, which would give the failure message for being one single calorie over target.  It would say, "Hey, everybody has a bad day now and then!"  It would do this for ONE stupid calorie. That's thankfully gone, but this is the same idea.  I see red (failure!) for a single calorie.  Lose it support says there’s no way to disable the failure message. Memo to developers: NEVER add something without a way to disable it.

Title: Don’t waste your time. They will nickel and dime you
----------------------------------------------------------
The app itself works just fine. It’s a (albeit simple) calorie counter that breaks it down by meal. The real problem with it is that unless you’re willing to fork over $40 or more for the premium version, you’re stuck with the basic functions which are just entering food items and counting calories. I I normally don’t care that Apple makes all their developers incorporate in app purchases in their apps but holy cow does LoseIt! Take it to another level. Every single time you open the app it bombards you with an ad to buy the premium version. I DON’T WANT TO BUY IT!!! Not only that but the app inputs the health data into the health app in a bizarre manner that makes using the health app to view your progress IMPOSSIBLE. Don’t waste your time. This app is a shameless cash grab feasting on those who want to lose weight. Paying these money vampires $40 won’t magically make you lose weight.

Title: Help?
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m frustrated and not sure how the get help—tho I would love some. For more than a year, I’ve been unable to sign in. When I go to reset my password, it doesn’t let me / doesn’t work. I lost track of time and a week ago, the AP renewed for another year—and I still can’t sign in. Today, I just deleted the app from my phone, then went to the App Store and got it again, using a different email address as a user name. I answered all the getting to know you questions, set up a new password, got charged again for a new subscription—and when I then clicked on the button to try for free and upgrade after 7 days, it just keeps reading as “upgrading.” It’s been “upgrading” for an hour. This is a new phone. My internet connect is excellent. What gives? Can someone help? I k so this is a good app, with great reviews, I want to be supportive—but I need help. How can I get it?

Title: Beware of this app.
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been paying for the premium version of this app for years. I initially much preferred this app to other fitness apps. However, I recently realized I was billed twice for a yearly subscription to this iPhone app both in September as well as November (I don’t use it on any other devices). I had been considering canceling my premium subscription for awhile because the features had been getting worse over the past year or two and there didn’t seem to be any real benefits for paying for the subscription. Then, I realized that I’m not even getting the premium features (there’s still an option to “go premium” in my app and invitations to do so every time I open the app), even though I’m being billed for the 2 yearly subscriptions. I’m definitely canceling both of my non-existent subscriptions and will be looking for another app.

Title: White Screen
----------------------------------------------------------
When I launch the app, it shows me a blank, white screen, with the default orange banner across the top 1/3 of it. No words, options to click on. This has happened multiple times over the last few days. I wen ahead and updated to whatever the newest one was. But even before the app was updated, I would still get this problem. Only use for work related purposes at the moment, not a premium user, but if I was, I’d be even more upset. Entering in data daily is a requirement and not being able to do so makes me feel negatively about the app itself. As far as troubleshooting, I’ve deleted the app, and re downloaded. Signed into my account, and once I have the option to select an icon to add some of my data(weight, meals, drink, exercises, etc.), but when I tap one of those icons, the app freezes. Please fix this. Thank you.

Title: REFUND!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been vigilantly searching for over a week on how to cancel the Premium subscription before it automatically renewed.  I’ve logged in online, through the app, through my apple account, etc. only to get more and more frustrated as there was no easy way to cancel.  Today I get a bill stating that it has renewed and if this happened in error to enter into App Store to request a refund.  I request the refund and explain in my 200 words or less what has happened.  I get an automatic response as soon as I hit send that says I do not qualify for a refund.  Once I receive that message, I am taken to a screen that allows me to cancel my subscription... only to find that it means for the NEXT renewal which would have taken place in 2020.  What a SCAM!  I want my money refunded!!

Title: Misleading
----------------------------------------------------------
I think it’s a bit misleading to not have the quote “in app purchases” Wording under the “get“ button before downloading this app because all you can track is your calorie count. All the other features, which is the overwhelming majority of them (carbs, protein, etc), can only be used by paying a WHOPPING price inside the app for the premium. In the year 2019, who just counts calories? Are we back in the 1970s? This is definitely a bait and switch-over-to-paid app.  It should’ve been called a Lite version since it doesn’t do anything valuable for any dieter because ALL the information on things you eat is an aggregate piece of information you need to know so you know if you’re going over the limit in ANY of the critical categories of food contents. Total bust, epic fail.

Title: Passive Aggressive Programming
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been non-stop on the go the past two days, between meetings and family and haven’t had time to enter in my items. Today I get a ridiculously passive aggressive pop-up that says, “OK, we get it. Seems like you’re not wanting to track your food right now; that’s fine. We’re here when you need us.” Well, I may be hangry because I literally had time for breakfast during my first meeting and haven’t had lunch or dinner yet (7pm), but as a trained health educator and as someone who understands behavior change communication, sending someone that message is not a great way to encourage a person to a) continue using your app, and b) motivate someone to want to. Terrible. Other than that, I really liked the features of the app. It is just too bad they have bad writers.

Title: 👎Upgrade is horrible
----------------------------------------------------------
It WAS a beautiful app.  Now you’ve made the screen busy trying to cram stuff into it that I don’t use but occasionally, and you’ve used light text colors, shrunk the font size so that I have to squint. When are 25 year old developers going to learn that 1/2 of your users are over 40 and we need dark fonts!  If I wasn’t forced into this new upgrade, I’d delete, synch and retrieve the old one, but it wouldn’t open.  I’ve been using this app for probably 7 years - it helped me lose 40 pounds and kept me on track to maintain that loss.  So the app itself is great but your new format/upgrade is horrible and I’m fuming that you’ve made it so inaccessible.  Please learn how to accommodate your older users.  You’ll soon be right here with the rest of us.

Title: Age minimum
----------------------------------------------------------
When I first downloaded this app, I was so excited because I’d finally be able to keep track of what I eat. But once I put my age (17) it said that I have to be at least 18. The problem is, I turn 18 in DECEMBER. I understand that maybe you believe younger people are only doing this due to body dysmorphia but allow me to assure you that not all teens are like this and that body dysmorphia comes in ALL ages. Some people, like me, want to live a healthy lifestyle. I like to workout, I know how many calories I’m supposed to eat according to my body weight, and I know that I need a sufficient amount of calories to get all the energy I need throughout my day, but unfortunately I don’t have anything to count them. Please allow the age minimum to be 17.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
The Lose It! program is designed based on the caloric and nutritional needs of adults. The program cannot account for the needs of members under the age of 18. For the health and safety of our members, we require a starting age of 18 or older.

Title: No idea why I lost ALL my data :-(
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used this app since September 2010. It helped me lose weight, but after I stopped using it I gained some back. Easy to know why: it is necessary to keep track of food intake and exercise calories. I am actually below my target weight. Why the low rating? Because last night, after restoring my iPhone from a recent backup when I bought a new iPhone I lost ALL my data. I had not updated to the latest version, did not have an account with the developer’s servers, and had no problems with their ads. But no other app erased my information like this one. Intentional or not, this happened because backing up to iCloud, something that had never failed in all my years as a user, was not enough. I do not intend to start again.

Title: Lacks BASIC feature!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I just redownloaded the app after a few years away to find that they have taken away your ability to track your fat, protein, and carbs in the basic version!  I may be wrong, but I remember it used to be there without paying for it.  To me, this is one of the most fundamental features in a food log and the most important thing to keep track of when you are trying to lose weight!  500 calories of candy and donuts are not the same as 500 calories from chicken breast and brown rice.  But without paying for the “premium” version, you would not know the difference in your food log.  All you get when you input your food is calories.  No fat, protein, or carbs.  I get trying to make money and all, but this is just ridiculous.

Title: Bait and Switch
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used Lose-It for years as a free app.  It has lots of the features that I like.  The premium has more features that if I wanted to use them that I would pay for them.  The one feature that was free was that it would give bonus calories from my Fitbit usage.  Apparently, Lose-It was giving that as a free part of their free app usage however they decided that they need to charge for it.  It is a shame that the company decides to bait and switch their features that accommodate them.  If they give a feature as free from the beginning, they need to keep it as free.  I reckon that they like to sucker people into using their app with free stuff and then months later, start charging for it.

----------------------------------------------------------
I have had this app for two years and loved it! There were no ads, very easy to use, and inputting your water intake didn’t require upgrading to Premium nor looking ahead into future dates. Now, I have to pay for those features? Sorry, but I’d rather not have to pay extra expenses just to remind myself how much water I drank and or to gain access to preview future dates. Also, knowing what this app used to be prior to the upgrades just makes it even more of a challenge because I’m stuck with  “why am I paying for this when all these features used to be free and I was already paying annually?” Anyway, the app had a good run.. gotta look elsewhere!

----------------------------------------------------------
Love lose it, do NOT pay for embody DNA. I’m very disappointed with the information provided in these results. I feel as though your product was poorly advertised.  It is no where near worth the money I spent. I am a breastfeeding mother and I was hoping to get more insights into my weight loss and food sensitivities with your product. Although you claim this is personal information, it is all too general, obvious, and very loose with terms like “likely” and “may.” Since I’m a healthy person with good habits, there was no benefits in receiving your very limited information. I expected so much more considering my succsss with the lose it app.

I am used to MFP but was looking for a change. I downloaded Lose It and wanted to see what it was like. Without realizing I purchased premium for a full year when I didn’t intend too, a monthly option was all I was looking for. I decided it wasn’t exactly what I was looking for and deleted and canceled my subscription. This is when I discovered I had purchased a year. They will not give a refund because I purchased through Apple, Apple will not give a refund because lose it doesn’t give refunds. Lesson learned. I will never purchase an app before trying on a free trial basis. I’m sure this app is amazing for some, it’s just not for me.

Title: Premium items distracting. Overselling. Deleting app
----------------------------------------------------------
I get that you are a freemium model. The free app is highly functional but the sales tactics have CROSSED THE LINE. The log screen is cluttered with locked premium options. We are all aware of the premium options. I can’t miss the emails. I can’t miss the notifications. You have a sale for every conceivable holiday. “National jump rope day. 25% off” “Presidents’ Day 25% off”. Each sale comes with some sort of contact with me. This was all fine, I felt it was the cost of free use of your platform. Now when I go to log I am distracted by the cluttered screen. The icons I need are mixed in with the nonsense stuff I would not log anyway.

Title: Cluttered
----------------------------------------------------------
I got this app nearly 10 years ago - at the time the app was simple with a clear, clutter-free interface. It was simple to use and very useful for simply setting weight targets and monitoring food/caloric intake and exercise/caloric use. I found it to be elegant and practical. With daily use, the app helped me to easily drop >15 lbs in a few short months. Over the years, as they've added more features ("bells and whistles" IMHO), it has become more cluttered and less practical. I rarely open this app anymore, even when I need a little 'tune-up' on my weight because i find the app to be so annoyingly busy/cluttered. Clean it up!

Title: Not all parts of the app work
----------------------------------------------------------
It was great but then it stopped storing my data.  I couldn’t see how many calories I had burned the previous day or for the entire week.  I contacted customer service because if I pay for an app I expect it to work.  After several emails and resetting my fit bit and the app the request was sent off to be fixed with an unknown time it would be fixed.  Weeks went by without an answer and no follow up so I stopped using the app and now use another one instead.  Unfortunately they still got my money but I’m much happier with my other choice.  Just be careful that some parts of the app may not work and they don’t have quick fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------
The app may be great. But if you think you’re going to try it for the 7 days and then cancel before it charges you the $40 bucks for the year, they make it impossible. I did everything thing in the world to try and get it off my phone and it not charge me and to no avail. I spent so long dealing with trying to prevent the charges that after it charged me anyway, I put off going back to deal with trying to get a refund. Now it’s past my 90 days since purchase so a refund is impossible. Another hard lesson learned. Just wish I had my money back since I never used it. Maybe someone will learn what I didn’t know from this.

Title: Never Get The Premium
----------------------------------------------------------
There seems to be no way out of the premium plan that is apparently an auto renewal program.  It is super disheartening when a company does this kind of thing- anything for money must be the motto.  In the iTunes settings there is no way to not have auto renewal of some sort once you have had the program.  You must remember how you enrolled, either iPhone or desktop, if you challenge the credit card company you will pay extra fees for the time to review the case.  I seriously can’t believe it! Go for the free program but DO NOT GET THE PREMIUM!  And, there was seriously no difference between the free and the premium!!!

----------------------------------------------------------
Love the tool....but once their developers start fixing one bug invariably it winds up creating another bug and you have no clue until you trip over it.  I wish they sent notifications when they made a change to the app then I could look closely at the aspects I find invaluable right away and do my own user acceptance testing!  Actually I wish they did an adequate job of regression testing!  Very frustrating.  This happens much too often.  I paid for lifetime Loseit and feel like I signed up for a lifetime of pain!  I'm considering cutting my losses and trying MyFitnessPal instead.  Loseit is THAT aggregating.

----------------------------------------------------------
All i want is too input what i ate and have lose it subtract the calories i burned from my Apple Watch from what i ate. I can’t seem to figure out how to do this. My workout was there but had a line through it and wasn’t subtracting from the total calories i ate. If i add a workout through lose its feature, it works just fine. I swiped left on the workout hoping i could delete it, then re-add it but now i can’t add my Apple Watch workout at all.  The calorie burn bonus is extra confusing. Is it saying under calories to go that i still need to burn X number of calories? No idea. Super confusing

I’ve never been so livid with an app. Was automatically charged after the free trial-was never stated that would happen. No notifications, just charged my credit card. Absolutely no contact information in the app or on the website. I was charged today and it seems like I was able to cancel the subscription via iTunes but it was unclear if that just means that I won’t be charged in another year. I don’t even know how to go about contacting anyone about it but I want my $42 back. The app itself is fine, I just don’t have the need for it and I don’t appreciate feeling scammed like this.

----------------------------------------------------------
Something is seriously wrong with this app. I am so sorry I paid for premium. After several of these notices I’ve determined they are just generic and the app is not coded properly to review your data. Been tracking daily for 100 plus days but still get stupid false messages like today’s another day you screwed up yesterday try today. Developers, if I don’t log a meal the prior day that doesn’t mean I screwed up. It means I skipped a meal for a reason. Many times I eat one meal a day. So do many other people. Getting messages you aren’t on track when you are is really demotivating.

Many mornings I get a push notification telling me I broke my streak and I should come back and log. Except I haven’t broken my streak. The app is just in error. Same thing happens with meals. I’m always getting pushes saying I forgot to log lunch or dinner or whatever, and then I go into the app and of course I’ve already logged it. The app is just wrong again. Super irritating to be paying a yearly fee for a broken app.

Title: Fantastic, but DON’T PAY FOR IT
----------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely fantastic app that allows you to track whatever data you want. Connects to other great apps and Apple health so you can access all the information in one place. Used it for a year and has taught me so many lessons about my habits and nutrition. I chose to pay for premium after a year with 50% off and I completely regret it. Not worth a cent with hardly any new features for what you’re paying for. Use it as the free app and save your $20-40. Maybe something will be added to premium that allows my money to be used for something but so far it’s been a disappointment.

Title: Going downhill fast due to greed
----------------------------------------------------------
This used to be my favorite iOS app, an essential part of my health regimen.  But now  there are so many annoying banners urging you to upgrade to the paid monthly subscription version that the app is almost unusable.  On the main screen, there’s a giant banner counting down the time until the “special upgrade offer”will last, the seconds ticking constantly.  If you log in that you ate three eggs, another obtrusive banner appears and cuts the screen in half, inviting you to learn more about eggs by upgrading. You can’t get rid of it.  It is a terrible customer experience.

Title: New Update is Horrific
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using LoseIt for 5 years and it was a great app but the newest update is ridiculous.  Over the years they have slowly pushed premium more and more, but now it’s just ridiculous.  Half the functionality of the app is now locked away behind a monthly subscription.  I would happily pay a one time fee to get rid of the ads or get some additional features but at this point it’s just a mess.  The app used to be clean and simple way to track my calories, nutrients, and exercise.  It’s a shame to see how it’s changed and now I’ve lost 5 years of tracking data.

Title: No Russian food in database
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app! It’s so easy to use, it has everything I nee (water intake, calorie counter, adjustable calories per meal, custom # of meals, patterns, streaks, etc). The only thing that makes me unhappy is that it doesn’t have Russia as a choice of database! Being from Russia, loving Russian food, and visiting Russia, it is very hard to use this app in Russia! I would say it is soooo inconveniente that I decided to write a review! I am also a member, so I am sad that I can’t use this app while I’m in Russia.... please, fix this! And I will put a 5 start rating!

Title: Ridiculous
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is ridiculous, tricks you into subscriptions . I was reading online and found that this was a great app to help you lose weight. I thought why not give it a try when I downloaded I kept getting pop ups for premium. And there was a deal for 2.50 a month. So I thought why not try a month and see what happens there. I was charged the yearly subscription  & am now fighting to get my money back. To be honest I haven’t used any of the other futures. But for it to be advertising 2.50 a month for a limited time I charge me full price is despicable.

They have mastered the way to cash in directly from your credit card without you having any control over it. I’m unable to cancel my subscription even after following their instructions to cancel the app, when I go there there is not an option to cancel...only to renew it ! When I contacted them about it they sent me an automated email saying that I have to go through Apple to cancel my subscription. When I go to my subscriptions in Apple the app doesn’t show there either for me to cancel it. Feeling robed here... I mean what is the difference?

Title: Horrendous Privacy Abuse & FAILS to give calorie 411
----------------------------------------------------------
Avoid this app!! Exercise, Google and protect your privacy instead.  It extracts all of your personal 411 b4 u can "use" it. But even after you're forced through dozens of screens of spam, questions and general annoyance - DATA COLLECTION, it doesn't even have a simple search for food calories. Save your time and just Google the 411 u need. Also, if you're overweight, you'll lose weight much faster if you spend all the time it would constantly take filling out this invasive app by exercising. If you want to stay fat, this app would be great!

Title: Recent Miscalculations
----------------------------------------------------------
Ive used this app for such a long time and loved it. The interface, ease, and storing my regular meals was so nice. Recently, I started noticing that my protein and carbs were lower than usual. I was eating the same foods I always ate. Then I added the protein and carbs itself, turns out, the app was adding my net carbs and protein incorrectly. This is a huge deal being that I always count my macros and I’m on a strict macro budget. The app says I have room for 50g of protein when I already reached my max when I do the calculations myself?

Title: Confusion
----------------------------------------------------------
The customer support is non existent. The lack of info being the same on each device is beyond frustrating. In addition, their “step by step” on line support is not accurate. How hard is it to record each step and accurately transcribe that info? And most important, you need to alter your info if you actually want to lose weight. The amount of calories they tell you to have according to standard weight guidelines - would only help you to maintain weight not lose weight. So really this is just a calorie recording device. A frustrating one.

Title: Not Really Helpful
----------------------------------------------------------
I started with the free version and at first it helped me become more cognizant of what I was eating and I became more mindful of what was nutritional vs. boredom/stress eating. I wanted more out of it so I can start to lose the weight and upgraded to the paid version. Not much changed. There are a few more options like tracking your water intake and connecting your exercise app with the program which is kind of cool, but it’s not intuitive and does not tell me anything more than I already know. Save the $30 and look into another option.

Title: Do not upgrade from the app
----------------------------------------------------------
This used to be great app - 7 years ago. Calorie counting is the only way to control weight and it really works. That said, this app got progressively worse over time. Interface got stupid, data got restricted, barcode scanner finds wrong food, loss of recipes; stupid useless functions added etc. basically psychological warfare to get you to upgrade. Ethics of that aside, I caved to the pressure and recently I tried to upgrade to premium to possibly get a better experience. It does not work. I got charged but the app was not upgraded.

----------------------------------------------------------
This app gives way too many calories right off the bat. There is no way to manually change your calorie intake and while I get that you can eat under the budget they give you, it’s still ridiculous that I have to look at what they’re suggesting. If I wanna lose 2 pounds a week, Lose It says to eat 2000+ calories a day. The whole app is busy, unorganized and measures things ina funky way or when you scan a barcode, the barcode is wrong. Either way it wasn’t worth the $20 I paid for the year. Uninstalling and going back to myfitnesspal.

So I’m out of 1yr fee for 2days of use with this app. Do yourself a favor and subscribe to 1month if you want to test it! At least your stuck with them for one month as opposed to 1yr! Hopefully the subscription really terms April 2021!

----------------------------------------------------------
I like this app a lot. I don’t use it consistently, but I enjoy it when I do. However, the app seemingly bombards me with invitations to subscribe, when I have been a subscriber for years. And although I am a subscriber, the app fails to recognize me as one. There is no “restore purchase” button. Instead there is a “subscribe” button which produces the message “You are currently subscribed to this” when I push it. However the app give me NO access to any features required by a subscription. For that I give it one star.

I don’t recall putting my email anywhere to receive a “secret ingredient” newsletter? I’m plant-based, something the app never bothered to ask. I’m very much not interested in the amount of calories in turkey. I’m not interested in recipes with animal ingredients in them. I don’t recall this newsletter being mentioned in the app but maybe it was my mistake. Either way because it wasn’t obvious if I was signing up OR they just added me to some list without asking I deleted the app and grabbed a less invasive one.

Then because I called them out on it they cancelled the subscription. Now that is a not the behavior of an honest company that would be willing to work with the person. Don’t waste your money

Some pop ups will take over the Apple Watch and and freeze the os until you clear the prompts. No app should do this on the Apple Watch since I use it to collect sleep data and heart rate.  I woke up to see the a loseit prompt on my Apple Watch and in the background the time on the Apple Watch was 11pm which was 8 hours ago. Once I clear the prompt the time updated and I confirmed no data was stored for the last 8 hours.  I have had the Apple Watch for about a year and never seen an app do this. Uninstalled!

----------------------------------------------------------
I purchased embody DNA and that forces you to use Lose It- but you have to purchase Lose it as well. I am currently using the “free” version. You cannot upload ahead for the week for food, there’s no option to have decimals/half adds for food- only scrolling options so you are over adding or under adding calories. Also, the free version does not let you sync your fitness watch to it so you manually have to add your activies in.  I have used MyFitness Pal for years- that is much more user friendly and free.

Title: 700 cal?
----------------------------------------------------------
Does it’s job, I guess. However, it put me on a 700 calorie plan. It doesn’t necessarily encourage restricting, but the pop up saying 700 calories isn’t recommended, is very very small print and can be easily missed. I had a 400 calorie lunch and a 300 calorie breakfast. And I had no more room left for dinner. This could be very dangerous for someone struggling with restricting and ED. I think a calorie minimum would be helpful, instead of the app recommending I eat 700 calories daily to reach my goal..

This app was good until they started changing things. You have to go premium and pay each month to see your macronutrients for the day, track your water intake, log in your foods for the next day or days to come, etc. MyFitnessPal lets you do just the basics that Lose It charges you for per month for FREE. All I want to know is my nutrients for the day, log in foods for the week and log in my water intake but I have to go premium. Don't waste money for what MyFitnessPal lets you do for free.

Useful little app, however I fell for the “pair with your Fitbit” Premium access only to discover it offers nothing more than your Fitbit app already does. Plus it doesn’t sync properly or have consistent data as your Fitbit. Different goals, calorie allotment, etc. Also don’t bother requesting a refund, you won’t get it. Most apps give you a trial period. I should have known this was a ripoff when I saw they didn’t offer a trial. Oh well, enjoy my $40 you snakes!

Title: You automatically signed me up!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m sure it’s a great app but WHY did you automatically sign me up for the 7 day trial?!?   I didn’t even have a chance to look at the app to decide for myself if I wanted to sign up...   now I can’t cancel because I don’t understand your directions...   it says “go to this page”... but where is that page located???  So frustrating that I have to waste my time figuring out how to cancel something I never ever signed up for!  Seems like quite the scam...

Title: Not worth the premium subscription price.
----------------------------------------------------------
Tried unsuccessfully to end premium subscription before annual charges. Unable to do so. ITunes directed me to the vendor, Lose It directed me to iTunes. Although customer service was friendly, they are not very empowered to help. No responsibility from vendor left me with a bad experience overall. Seriously, the app is not worth the $30. I would have been more generous with my rating if it was under $20. Also, not comfortable with the privacy terms.

Title: Premium required to connect Fitbit
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used Lose It for probably four years or more. Always loved it, very easy to use and accurate. I loved being able to connect my Fitbit directly to the app and being able to do everything I needed in one convenient location. As of September 2017, they require you to have a premium account in order to connect your Fitbit to the Lose It app. Another expense that I cannot afford. I will not be returning to this app unless they change this.

Title: Where are the Ounce and Gram measurements?
----------------------------------------------------------
For literally everything? We weigh all of our food and there is a whole slew of things that measures in grams on the packaging but the option isn’t available when you try and input it. Some things do but it’s so rarely, it’s become a daily frustration trying to input recipes. I’m dieting, I need to keep track of things accurately and not just guess how many cups or tablespoons whatever ingredient is. Please make this standard for all items.

Title: Need premium account now to sync Fitbit.
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used the loseit app on and off since 2012. It really does work for weight loss. When I start getting off track, I start logging my food again to lose the pounds I’ve gained. What is disappointing now is that my Fitbit will no longer sync with the app. I now need to pay for the premium account. Not sure when this happened, but it’s very disappointing. This app is not as useful to me as it was before. I guess they just want the $$$. 😕

Title: So slow and buggy it’s unusable
----------------------------------------------------------
The food database has always been slow. Now it hangs when scrolling on the logging page and super slow with the food selection. Also there is a nasty bug which selects the wrong item when you’re at the bottom of the list so you have to do it again. Buggy and slow, super quality folks. I can’t afford to waste so much time to try and log meals. I’ve been using this for over 5 years and I’m through. Don’t waste your time, get something else.

Title: Used to love it.
----------------------------------------------------------
I used Lose It for EIGHT YEARS. But I deleted it today because now I must pay if I want my Fitbit to sync with the app. I understand free apps have to have ads and such (and this app has A TON of them), but to have a service that you offered for free for YEARS and then require money, is just bad taste. It's a shame because I was about to sign up for premium, anyway. Now I will give my $$ to MyFitnessPal. Bye, Lose It! YOU JUST LOST ME!

Title: INCORRECT INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------------------
Overall, this app is okay, but I have a problem with their “verified” information on foods that are logged. I have found several instances of items that were supposedly “verified” that are inaccurate. They are telling people that the nutritional info is accurate and complete when it is not. The whole point of this app is to calorie count and if their “verified” info is incorrect, then the whole point of the app. is lost. Do better!

Title: No longer useful for simple history keeping.
----------------------------------------------------------
I used an earlier version on an old iPhone 5 to track and graph my weight as I followed another (low carb) regimen. That phone died and the version I found to use on my new rx forced me through a setup, gave nonsensical results when told that my goal was the same as my present weight, and finally presented a screen that had no exit without setting up an account or logging into an existing one. I want no account so deleted the app.

Title: Skip it
----------------------------------------------------------
It used to be a good app. But they made some of the free features part of the premium content. Fitbit for example. You used to be able to connect your fitbit to the app and it would track the steps and give you bonus’s for your steps. You have to be a paid subscriber to use this now. It will track your steps with your phone, but it does not work as well. The steps are never accurate since I don’t always have my phone in my pocket.

Title: Disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used this app off and on for many years. I have paid sometimes but currently I do not. I don’t mind the adds usually but today has been full of ads for fast food. I understand this is how they make money it it seems to me that it is not helping people who may have a hard time resisting such foods. To me it seems hypocritical  for a site to “encourage” a healthy lifestyle to use such ads. I will no longer be us no this app.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
We can block specific ads after they have appeared but unfortunately cannot block them in advance. For this reason, some members may see undesirable ads when they appear. We appreciate the report, and we will continue to try our best to block ads that could be distasteful or unhelpful.

----------------------------------------------------------
I bought a lifetime premium at some point so I should never have a new bill. BUT As many of you, I didn’t think to check when The sorry dirtybirds sent me a bill for monthly service. Due immediately, renew your membership NOW. I didn’t think about it I just renewed. I hate cheaters. Isn’t it enough the I bought a life time membership? Do you have to wheedle another month or two out of me. One star only because I can’t vote none.

----------------------------------------------------------
It now redirects where it shouldn’t when I click a link. It has problems loading. And it has problems searching. The food guesses it gives as I enter the food is way off base.

The update stinks so much so I’m canceling the auto renewal

Title: Lost over 40lbs using app but deleting now
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m sorry to say the free version of the app has gotten usable with the constant, “go premium” notifications every time I opened the app. I loved this app and used it to help lose 40lb. So I kept it on my devices but I can’t anymore. I’m removing it. I understand developers have to make money but if you’re gonna make the free version unusable then don’t offer it free. Thanks again for the good time and good luck going forward.

The application became to bothersome to use after several weeks. I had already upgraded to the premium subscription and what a waste of money. Not to mention the fact I canceled last year through the several steps I had to follow to find out that this year I was charged again in my annual subscription!!! Looks like they never canceled it! What a joke! So frustrating!! So yet again I canceled, let’s see if this time it sticks.

Title: Inaccurate data...
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been using this app since July and I’m down 30 pounds despite the inaccuracies. I have to double check every entry. Please stop allowing users to update random foods and do a double check on the math. 1 g of fat is 9 cal, protein and carbs are four.  You can’t have 50 calories when fat is 25 grams.  I’m moving on to a different app that doesn’t allow users to update the main database and the data as checked for accuracy.

I used this for quite a while on my iPad before interrupted for work relocation.  Now it says my iPad can no longer use it;  downloaded for my iPhone, and it wants a new account that requires answering way too many personal & unrelated questions;  once finally getting it open, the new interface is all but worthless (including more than 50% of the display interrupted by promoting purchases of upgrades or other apps/services).

----------------------------------------------------------
I’m on my iPad Pro, attempt to make a new account. It asks me what my goal weight is, and nothing else. It then sets a 2,200 calorie goal and assumes I want to gain 10 lbs to get to my goal weight because it didn’t ask me anything else and now I’m spending my morning trying to figure out how to change the calorie budget - or just start over. And you want me to sign up for premium when you can’t even develop an app properly?

I really liked the free app and was using it for a few days. Suddenly the free app stopped working and all that is displayed is the link to sign up for the Premium version. I was under the impression that I could use the app for free, and deal with the ads. I don't know if this situation where I can't use it at all is intentional or a software glitch. I would have given the app a 5 star rating if it didn't just lock me out!

Title: Subscription renewal
----------------------------------------------------------
I received an email notice about automatic renewal in Dec, but did not want to renew. I went to Apple site on my device and thought I removed the renewal, but Loseit does not bill through Apple. I also tried to sign on to the Loseit app, forgot my password, and requested an email to change password, but never received a reply. On Jan 5th I was billed for a renewal, and charged through my Apple account... seems fraudulent.

----------------------------------------------------------
I haven’t been on lose it in years. I downloaded it and tried to make an acct. the site said I already had an acct but my password was wrong. I tried every password I knew but it would not let me in. My grievance is there isnt a place that says ‘ forgot your password’ so you can set a new one! Like most other apps. So I deleted the app after spending a good twenty minutes on trying to remember a password that would work

Title: Tries to do everything, but fails at core function
----------------------------------------------------------
The main problem with the app is most of the calorie data is apparently crowdsourced and is wildly inaccurate.  Some items will have 10 or more choices, and if you do not already know the calorie info then you have no idea which to choose.  The so-called “verified “ entries are just as likely to be wrong as any other.  Even restaurant or packaged items are often wrong even though the correct data is publicly available.

Title: This app traps you into paying
----------------------------------------------------------
This app was great at helping me lose weight until I used a feature (that was not marked as a “premium” feature like other options clearly were) I can’t go back to the free version after having used a “premium feature” so now I’m forced to pay to upgrade to a premium account if I want to continue to use the app to track my calories. Other than the sneaky tactics used to trick people into spending their money it works.

Title: Their math is WRONG!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app but the math is wrong!  Today alone I had 4 entries that were mathematically wrong. When you’re counting calories it is crucial for the math to be correct. For example the serving size for an entry was 175. I carefully portioned 1.5 servings. The app out my total at 449 calories!! WAAAAAAAAY off! I had to enter single portions under multiple categories (lunch, dinner, snack) to get correct amounts.

----------------------------------------------------------
I used and lived this app for years. Even paid for a lifetime membership. However, since the last update or two, it’s become slow, sluggish, and prone hangs. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling it — didn’t help. I requested assistance and was told that the latest upgrade would fix it — didn’t. I use this every day. I can’t wait weeks for this to be fixed, and so I’ll look for a better app. Bye bye, LoseIt.

----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve used lose it for the last 7-8 years and it’s so much worse than it used to be. The “update” function that should happen irregularly is a pretty consistent feature when I log on in the morning. The barcode scanner either doesn’t register the barcode or inputs food incorrectly. And the pop ups for Lose It Premium are constant. I’m no longer impressed with the product and will likely switch to another soon.

Nothing really useful here unless you’re willing to shell out for their subscription. Constant emails about “sales“ but turn out to be the same price normally charging.

The only plus ways it allowed the app to synchronize with my Fitbit ... a feature which used to be free.
