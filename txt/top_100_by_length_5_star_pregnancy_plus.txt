Title: Best overall preggo app!
----------------------------------------------------------
Very comprehensive & great overall layout! This was my favorite pregnancy app (used in conjunction with the Baby Center & What to Expect When You're Expecting apps). I liked getting the weekly push notifications for how the baby was progressing & what to expect/do/learn each week. I read the daily info & blogs at my leisure. I really, really like the kick count icon bc it lets you exit the app & go back to continue your kick count. I also liked logging my own stats separately (weight, appts w/my blood pressure & baby's heartbeat count, bump pics, etc.). They have the best breakdown of baby's weekly size, weight, & length & info as well. Overall, I think this app gives the best practical & helpful info in an easy to use & view format. I would recommend using this as the main app & Baby Center app for tips on purchasing baby products & other "is this normal?" info (their layout isn't as helpful though & they don't let you save articles each week in a "to read" list like Facebook, so you have to remember to go back to it). I already recommended this app to friends. Worth paying the upgrade fee!!

Title: Best all-around pregnancy app
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app. The illustrations are beautiful, and I love the amount of info they give you -- just the right amount of daily and weekly updates. It's great having the weight tracker and appointments in the app (I always record my bp and the baby's heart rate!), as well as the timeline, baby size guide, names section and even hospital bag/birth plan check lists. It's really well organized. There's a kick counter that looks good, too that I will probably start using soon as well (I'm 27 weeks and definitely feeling lots of movement!). I'm a minimalist, so I didn't want to have multiple pregnancy apps and I'm so glad that this is the one I went with. I specifically didn't want one with message boards because they just make me anxious and for me they're not helpful -- if I have questions or concerns I'd rather just ask my doctor or family/friends. This app is completely worth the modest price once you get out of the first trimester and I would definitely recommend it.

Title: Great for Husbands!
----------------------------------------------------------
When my wife surprised me with the wonderful news we were hoping for I was very excited! I also wanted to make sure I was with her every step of the way and one step ahead of her if I could. I got the app and used it free for the first 15 weeks and I decided to buy it. Best couple dollars I have ever spent. Pregnancy plus has helped me understand the day to day changes happening with my wife's body physically as well as emotionally.  Learning the daily development of our child has been amazing and has helped to deepen our bond. Daily tips, suggestions on everything from health, diet and exercise, to helping pick out baby names and advice on setting up the nursery. This app has it all and we are all learning from it. Also gave me lots of "good husband points" staying in tune with my wife's needs. Also a lot of fun with the weekly development pictures of the baby. I recommend this app to everyone going through pregnancy. Especially first time moms and dads.

Title: The only pregnancy app you will need
----------------------------------------------------------
This app offered insightful information from day one of my pregnancy. I found the daily and weekly information to be extremely helpful and surprisingly spot on when I needed it the most.  All of the features offered give you tons of minor and major information throughout your journey including sizes as compared to fruits and veggies, images of the baby at each month, ultrasound examples, and everything in between. The app also made it super easy to find and save baby names that you like from a incorporated database as well as creating your own. You can also make lists to email to yourself that include what you are packing in your hospital bag as well as setting up your birth plan from a variety of options you can select or create yourself. I am actually kind of sad that it's all done. I think I will have to check out their baby app too! I highly recommend this app to anyone new and starting their pregnancy journey, it was well worth the money!!

Title: The Best Pregnancy App worth the $3.99
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been pregnant, now, seven times. I have used many different pregnancy applications both free & paid. I have to say this is the most complete, most advanced, most accurate application. With these other apps I generally know all the weekly pregnancy info they provide having done this a few times & read many books on pregnancy. However with this app I've actually been surprised by some information, which was very cool. The other thing I enjoyed that seems minor but, I was happy with, was when referring to  "morning sickness" it said something like "by now most moms are feeling better but there are a few who still have morning sickness". I have hyperemesis grevardium & it last for me from about 7-9 weeks all the way to sometimes after I deliver. It's a minor note but it's always a little annoying when books & apps assure me I am "now over the nausea" when I know I'm not even half there yet. Paying for this app was a no brainer for me.

Title: Great app for pregnancy
----------------------------------------------------------
Wonderful app for pregnancy and for a few bucks you can use it after the 1st trimester which is totally worth it. They do mention that it DOES cost money to continue after 1st trimester but they do NOT flood you with advertisements so it doesn’t interrupt ur experience at all. Like some other apps flood you with requests to upgrade. Not so here. Which is a giant plus. This app Has a kick counter included. I love how it reminds me every week when I turn to the next week, also gives helpful articles on what to except etc. the images are in range from 2D to 4D to computer generated animations which are beautiful. Also shows timeline of tests that are done at ur OBGYN s. Included appointment tracker and reminder, so u can easily store the info for scrapbook later. Other features as well.

Title: Best Pregnancy App
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app since I found out about my pregnancy. I downloaded multiple apps so I could compare. This app was the best in all. I always open it everyday since I get a new paragraph in the daily blog. O also love going through what other moms had to say. It has many topics I never knew about since I'm a first mom to be. I also love the images they provide because It gives me an idea of how my little one is growing each day. I love all the features because i can see how my body is changing and put in information about my self. My partner also has used the app with me and he was the one that got me to purchase the full version because we could tell it was a very useful app. I would recommend this app to all the new parents like us because it helps us get more inform.

Title: Used for all three pregnancies!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is my favorite pregnancy app and I’ve used it for all three of my pregnancies! The articles about how my baby is growing and what’s happening to my body that specific week is my favorite part and has been very accurate for me personally. When I was 9 weeks pregnant with my third, I started feeling really hormonal and nauseous…I opened up the app and it literally said that this week I might feel more nauseous and hormonal than before! It then went on to share different ways I could help nauseous etc. This type of thing has happened multiple times on this app and I love that! I feel like it knows me haha. It’s filled with the kind of information I want during pregnancy. It’s also easy to use. I’ve recommended this app to all my pregnant friends🥰

Title: Love !
----------------------------------------------------------
Really easy to use! Gives you different type of scans to see what your baby would look like ! Love how it shows your done with one week and shows your what will be happening during the week that you are currently in. Only down side is for Free app only shows baby's development up to 15weeks & you have to Pay $3.99 for the rest of the weeks, but it comes with other incentives as well that you can use to your discretion...i feel this app should offer all 40weeks development for free. I really like this app because it's shows baby more realistically than other apps that use anime/cartoonish babies. Everyone should give it a try ! I think I downloaded about every app in the store I stuck with this one & What To Expect ! Both are great !

Title: Wonderful app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I can’t say enough about this app! I love everything about it and the best THE BEST PART IS NO COMMUNITY! Some other apps have a community portal and the people are so horribly rude and nasty. Idk why anyone would pay $50 a year for a crappy app with zero support and rude people. Pregnancy + is the absolute best app I’ve ever downloaded for pregnancy support! And to “unlock” it’s full potential is only $2! This app has won my heart 💜 thank you for creating this app! So supportive and informative with lots of great things like contraction counter, different loggers like weight and even appt reminders, even a checklist for hospital/birth center bags. This is number 1 go to app and I’ve had 8 babies! I recommend this app to everyone.

Title: Great app!
----------------------------------------------------------
At the beginning of my pregnancy I added a bunch of apps to follow along week to week. This is the only app that I kept...and well worth the small amount of money! It shows you week to week in a detailed description how you your baby should be developing. As and added bonus there is a small daily blog to address experiences you will have, answering questions that you will wonder about along the way! Also included are weekly size charts, contraction monitoring, calendars for your weight and appointments, places to add notes and pictures to track during your pregnancy and more! I really began looking at this on a regular basis and will be purchasing the next app for my babies first year! I highly recommend!

Title: To Pregnancy App (Health & Parenting Ltd.)
----------------------------------------------------------
I absolutely loved and enjoyed every week of this app as it guided me with my progress. Very much accurate. Well detailed & expressed. However, I do recommend to the creators of this app to add a feature for those parents or mothers that deliver early, premature baby. As, I myself being one of many early delivering mothers wish I had the option to edit/update within this app to proceed to educate me in those moments when my baby was in the incubator etc. Please look into that & this app is that much closer to being amazing!!!! Regardless, thank you! I will keep my app until we're ready for baby #2. Hopefully by then you will have added that additional detail. Prematurity. Thank You! Best Regards -Yadira

Title: Perfect
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is great for first time moms. My parents and my in-laws live in different states as do all our siblings and family, so this up was very helpful for me as I didn't have people close by to ask questions or get advice. I love discovering the size of baby each week, the weight tracker, and the pictures. So far the app has been on point with info and advice and always seems to come right when I am experiencing it for myself - it's great. The only thing I wish was better was once the second trimester starts the baby pictures are harder to see.. Whether they are blurry or zoomed in, is rather see a full "picture" of what the baby might look like at this stage instead of just the hand or up close face.

Title: Very impressed with 4th pregnancy
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm pregnant with my fourth baby I do like what to expect and baby center as well, as those are what I have used in previous pregnancies but I am still learning new things every day. This app has a lot of very useful information as well as interactive tools and fun too. I love watching the slide show of the growing fetus turn into a baby it is very realistic and this app also allows you to track your progress like many other but I will be able to look back at my journey farther down the road and remember the smaller details I will soon forget. It's like an informational journal with interactive tools. I have the pro version and am very pleased with my purchase. The name finder is also fun.

Title: *Nearly* perfect - can’t adjust cycle length
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is absolutely incredible. It’s really everything you could need and want in a pregnancy app. Lots of information, planning capabilities, and my most favorite feature - the weekly growth aspect that offers true to size fetal development. My ONLY gripe is that you cannot adjust your menstrual cycle length, so if your periods aren’t exactly 28 days, the only way to track your pregnancy is through a due date. That’s certainly not a deal breaker, but when I look at my calendar I would like to be able to see my LMP. I have PCOS and ovulate close to 3 weeks into my cycle, so I would just like to be able to customize my calendar to reflect that.

Title: I love this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m not sure exactly why others had bad experiences with this app, I never had to pay a dime to use it other than the extra features like planning a hospital bag and stuff like that. But I honestly just use this app to tell me the size my baby should be and the weekly development of my little boy. I absolutely love this app, it’s super easy to use and always has very useful information! The only tip I could think of is to maybe send out push notifications on like weekly updates when you go into a new week of your pregnancy or to a new trimester. Like I said though, the app is amazing and helps me stay sane between OB appointments!!

----------------------------------------------------------
I NEVER purchase anything on app's, however this ONE time I did. I couldn't find a pregnancy app that would show me visually along the way how much my baby would change week to week, that's what initially sold me, which is awesome. I love all the other features as well! It tracks ur weight, baby, ur belly photos, size and weight of baby, articles regarding concerns, questions, and things to expect, shows time frames of each month, and waaay more. I'm now in my last month of pregnancy and still very pleased with this app!! Highly recommend the purchase to continue throughout ur entire pregnancy!! Love, love, love it!!!

----------------------------------------------------------
This is my second pregnancy and I’m scheduled to be induced tomorrow at 39 weeks. I used this app religiously almost every day throughout this entire pregnancy. I looked forward to seeing my “virtual baby” grow week by week and reading all the the information about his wellbeing and growth. My little 4 year old daughter fell in love with the virtual baby! She loved touching the screen to make him move around and make baby expressions in the “womb.” This app was very helpful and extremely fun to have on hand. I would recommend this app for anyone going through pregnancy whether it’s your first or 4th! Great app!!

----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app everything about it is amazing but the only thing I beg the creators to add, is a calendar & with the calendar show you how many months you've completed & how much more you have go, like whatever's completed those days are highlighted or something and whatever if left have like some cute symbol or whatever next to the number, it would make it so much better instead of me having to go to the calendar in my phone. PELASS CONSIDER THIS. I love this app and it's totally worth the money just please consider adding that feature, I know a lot of mothers like myself would appreciate it .

I used this app from 6 weeks and on. I'm a 1st time mom so it was specially exciting for me to read about the changes my baby and I were going through. I like the baby ultrasounds, the fruit/baby size comparison, but my favorite part was the "partner's advice". My husband looked forward to resin the weekly updates on baby and I and the partner info really helped him understand what his roll was and how he could be involved and helpful. The descriptions under "your body" were 90% accurate and I would find myself laughing because it was exactly what I was going through that week. Thank you!

----------------------------------------------------------
This is my second pregnancy and I wanted something different. I didn't have access to apps last time so enjoyed hunting around for a good one. We had the free version for awhile before my husband upgraded it for me. I thought the to do list and shopping list were amusing and fairly handy but since I'm having a home birth, the hospital bag option was useless. It was also confusing at first to figure out how the contraction timer worked. But it was fun overall. My two yr. loves looking at the weekly pictures of the baby and watching the progression video. Biology crash course, right? 😉

I absolutely love this pregnancy app. I had three apps & this is my favorite! The images are remarkable because they are very realistic. I love that you can see the development week by week through 2D & 3D images. The week by week information provided was very detailed. All of these things made me feel more connected to my son when he was gestating. I utilized the appointment section, weight tracking, hospital bag check list, birth plan, and name suggestion sections. One of my favorite tools was the kick counter. Even my 6 year old daughter had fun using the kick counter.

Missing my wife’s pregnancy due to the Military was rough, but I truly feel like this app helped ease my mind. It’s very easy to use and tracks the entire pregnancy. Whenever I wondered how big my son was or had questions about the pregnancy this app literally had all the answers. It’s a great way to stay connected with your spouse for the entirety of your pregnancy whether you’re geographically separated or together. Also it won’t let you forget what week you’re on so I was always on the ball when it came to sending my wife a nice text or call every week of progress.

----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded all of the major pregnancy apps and have been using all of them. Now almost halfway through my pregnancy, I can say without a doubt that this is the best one. The weekly and daily information is great (not all apps have something new for you every day). The weight tracker is the easiest to use of all the apps. Has important functions like contraction counter and kick counter, and some bonuses that are really useful like the baby name list (you can search or add your own), list managers, birth plan, and various guides that provide useful information.

I used this App for all 3 of my pregnancies. It's such a great tool to track baby's growth and development. I found the checklists very helpful (especially for my first) and enjoyed reading the weekly updates about what baby was up to and the changes my body was going through. My toddlers also loved following along with the size chart and would often ask what fruit is the baby now? It was fun to show them pics too of the baby as it would be developing in the uterus. Great App for me and my family enjoyed it too! Highly recommend especially for first time Mums.

I love that I can see a 2D and 3D ultrasound of what real babies at this stage look like. And the animated graphic for each week is beautiful and happy.  And the weekly updates are great! There's so many features on it that I can get all the info I want in one place which is great. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone looking for the perfect pregnancy companion! By far the best one out there.

I got this app in week 6 of my pregnancy and it seemed great, so I purchased it before the trial even ran out.. I used it up until the very last day before my baby was born!! It is great. I love the tips and information, the weight tracker, and the name list. I used this app to pack my hospital bags and make sure my nursery was ready for my little one's arrival. From beginning to end, this app was useful for my entire pregnancy. I don't even want to delete it even though I'm not using it anymore. Might just keep it around to look at from time to time. :)

I loved being able to see the pics of what my developing baby may look like and I also enjoyed the belly growth picture as well. I absolutely recommend this app to any pregnant woman!

Title: I love this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I use this app every single day! Yes, I did pay the $3.99 for the full version. But, seeing as I get on the app every day it seemed like money well spent. I love tracking my weeks & see what my baby looks like each month! I love putting in all my information & love the feature that allows you to upload your sonograms. I can go to one place & see all my babies pictures. Yes, I'm aware I could just look at my phones photo log, but something about it being on this app makes it much more special. I haven't had one issue with the app since I purchased it.

Title: Great pregnancy tracking app
----------------------------------------------------------
It’s the best pregnancy related app I’ve downloaded. I love everything about it. There’s lots of useful information and tips. You can track your baby’s development and overall growth. The only complaint I have is you have to pay for certain features, I never paid of anything in the app and it’s still the best app I’ve used. I’m sure if someone did buy the other features offered in the app it would be even better. I would recommend this app to anyone tracking their pregnancy, and I will definitely be using it again when I get pregnant in the future.

Title: This app is a MUST
----------------------------------------------------------
If you are looking for an app that you can grow with day by day....this is it. This app is a way to look at your baby week by week and see how it's changing. It also has information that changes daily in a variety of topics, weight tracker, important information for drs apts, blogs to read and discuss things on, and it gives you so much more options. (TOO many to list) the only option I don't like is to continue using the app you have to pay 3.99$ after 15wks. If your further along than that you can't see anything. TOTALY worth it though.....😍

----------------------------------------------------------
My daughter became pregnant and I have always talked to her about pregnancy and what not. I wanted to find a app that can help her threw her pregnancy and keep track of everything she goes threw and we both love this app so much there's things that it teaches you that I never knew with having my five kids it's one amazing app that is for sure. We both love reading the blogs and all the information that it gives us about the size of the baby and all that, we recommend it to everyone we know who becomes pregnant it is so worth it for sure..

Title: Great app, one update requested
----------------------------------------------------------
We love the app! The information is great and it’s so nice that it lets you log so many important things such as appointments, your weight and birth plan notes. We would love to recommend it to our friends, but we’d like one option added. When a man signs up to follow along with the development of his baby, he should have the option of logging in as a spouse and being greeted as a “husband” not just a “partner”. Those of us who are married and awaiting the birth of their baby would very much appreciate this option. Thank you in advance!

Title: Excellent app; worth the fee after 14 weeks
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm kind of annoyed that people give this app poor reviews because full features are only unlocked for free through week 14.  It tells you that in advance. And don't be cheap people.  I'm about to get pregnant again and my original 2.99 has gone a long long way and now will guide me through a new baby.  The information in this app is beyond tracking weight and weekly bump pictures which I loved) and fetus size updates.  There are helpful guides, time-appropriate short articles and reminders along the way, so it was well worth it for me.

----------------------------------------------------------
Of the 5 apps that I have been using, this is the best by far. Yes, I know 5 apps...overkill haha...just excited to learn everything that's happening in there. Each week the app tells you about the baby, your body, multiples, health tips and there is a section for partners. It was spot on with all my symptoms and questions at each stage. I love the daily articles/topics, the timeline guide, the appointments section, the to do list section...the app has everything you need to get prepared and be organized. I would recommend to everyone.

This app is very helpful and interesting, they always have something new to read each day. I really like how it has how many weeks you have left, a description of your growing baby, and how it you lets you keep track of upcoming appointments, etc. This app has so many features it's just an overall awesome pregnancy app. I definitely recommend this one, you won't be disappointed. (It's like 4 something dollars for some reason but that might of included taxes. Its worth it though with all that's included in it and the accuracy of it.)

----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded 3 other pregnancy apps before I found this one. This is by far the best one in my opinion. It is easy to navigate and has all the info I was looking for. It includes illustrations as well as actual ultrasound pics weekly plus tells you the average length and weight of your baby week by week. It has the fruit/vegetable comparison which I like as well. Lots of helpful tabs to click with useful information.  You can enter your own info and pics as well.  I deleted all the other apps and just use this one exclusively now.

Title: This is a great app!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is an amazing app to track your pregnancy! It was my number one pregnancy tracking app in the beginning. But when I was around 20 weeks the picture on the app did not match how many weeks pregnant I was. Like it would show me my baby at 21 weeks when I am only 20 weeks. And it did that throughout the entire app. I deleted the app and recently downloaded it back now that I am 35 weeks and I still have the same problem. Please fix this! It’s an amazing app besides this glitch. If this is changed, I will give the app 5 stars.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for the feedback. This may have to do with whether you have chosen to see the 'completed' or 'current' week in the Pregnancy section of your Profile. The week number on the Today page is dynamic based on the settings. In Profile (upper right), scroll down to the Pregnancy section where you can decide if you want to see the 'current' or 'completed' week.

Title: Used this app the whole pregnancy, worth paying for.
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm not one who ever pays for apps, so when I saw this was $3.99 I wasn't too thrilled. But I figured I would try it after reading all of the reviews, and I'm so glad I did! By far the most useful, informative, and resourceful pregnancy app out there. I downloaded all of the other competitor apps, and ended up deleting all of them. This app has been my go to app for my whole pregnancy, I look at it multiple times a week (and I'm 39 weeks now!!) Id definitely recommend this to anyone who's pregnant, worth the money for sure.

I love this app, it's better than most I've tried and bought. Love the pictures. After multiple miscarriages, ectopic pregnancy where I lost a tube, 2 failed fertility cycles my husband and I decided to adopt. 3 weeks after our sons adoption we got pregnant on our own. I am almost 11 weeks (longest pregnancy we've ever had) and everything is going on target per not only my OB but this app as well so I can see the point of the app being free until 13 weeks. You just never know what can happen. I plan on buying this app then.

----------------------------------------------------------
I had another pregnancy app but their daily tidbits didn't coordinate with the pregnancy timeline so at 19 weeks I started looking for another app. I tried about 8 others including this one. I love the daily tidbits and the weekly updates are very detailed. There's a lot of extra features with this app. This is my 2nd pregnancy and I read several books with the first, and I enjoy reading a out health and our bodies so I found this one to be accurate and up to date. I would highly recommend this app!!! Worth the money!!!!

Title: Favorite pregnancy app
----------------------------------------------------------
I recently had a 42 hour labor with lots of stalls. The contraction counter was my best friend throughout, helping me record my progress with minimal effort. The graphics on this app are also awesome - you grow to love the little baby on the screen over those 9 months! It helps a lot to be able to visualize your baby’s growth, especially in the early months where you don’t yet feel baby moving. The daily news feed/ advice section is well curated as well. Just get this app don’t skip the contraction counter upgrade!

Title: Great app!
----------------------------------------------------------
Loved using this app throughout my pregnancy. The only issue I had was the descriptions of what is happening with baby often change from using "he" or "she" to "it." My baby is not an "it."  Also towards the end weeks the daily blog seems to skip back to earlier topics and even took me to "week 16" when I was in the final month. The constant warning messages that pop up during contraction timer usage were annoying. Other than these editing issues I found the app to be very user friendly and include all my needs.

I downloaded several different apps when I first found out I was expecting again. At first this one wasn’t my favorite because it had a lot of the features blocked that you had to pay to access (as most of them do), however, they now offer a lot more and it’s amazing! I look forward to my update every week and I’m super thankful for all the people that put effort into this app. It helps me and my husband to see what’s coming and what to expect. 10/10 I will recommend this app to every pregnant lady that asks!

If you like to have something new to read everyday and have an app that organizes your pregnancy, this is for you. You can keep track of your appointments, new baby shopping items to keep track what you have and what you need, and you can even track contractions when you get to that point. You can browse possible names and bookmark them as you are deciding, see images comparable to your baby's growth, and even store pictures of your belly growth to review your timeline over the months. Lots of neat features.

This is my first pregnancy, so of course I downloaded any and all pregnancy apps I could find that looked interesting and useful. I rummaged through all of them and deleted all of them but this one. I keep up-to-date with how far along I am and I look forward to different articles it reveals to me each day. I write all the questions i have and bring my ipad with me to each doctors appointment. I find it extremely useful and worth the small amount of money it costs to access everything it has to offer. :)

I got this app when I suspected that I may be pregnant put in my lmp and it told me a due date and how far I was. I then when to the doctor a week later and they told me I was 5 weeks pregnant just like the app told me. I also love it show and gives detail about what's going on with me and my baby. Not saying that you shouldn't go to the doctor because that is key but this app tells you the very same thing your doctor would. I highly recommend this app to any women who is expecting.

My friend recommended this app, and as a new soon to be mom, I am so happy it exists! I smile every time I open the app or cry (more on the crying side). The images and information has been so beautiful and beyond helpful. I’m in my first trimester, and needless to say - it’s scary. Having the info and images and help with this app seems to help alleviate some fear and bring a smile to my face. Since I do not talk to my doctor everyday it helps to be able to turn to the app to get updates. Thank you!

It's also nice to be able to show my daughter & nieces what the baby looks like & the size the baby is. I recommend this app to any one who is expecting.

This app is a great way to sort out all things pregnancy. I liked a lot of the information it gives you on baby's development. I am a registered nurse and it is pretty accurate. I enjoyed tracking my weight but would have liked a normal chart behind the graph.  Sometimes info is oddly oriented towards twins which I am not having but not really a problem. My only real complaint is it does not sink with my iPad and you have to pay twice if you want it on your iPad and iPhone.

I enjoy using this app most importantly I really like the 3-D images of a growing baby that you can choose from. Every week there is a new development with you baby to learn about . The articles are Informative and decent in length. Also come down your feed just as soon as you need them. There are trips for the partners of mommy to be as well. I screen shot them and send them to my husband. I track my weights and measurement of my baby size. And it’s all free!

Was disappointed that after a certain amount of weeks you had to pay for it to get anything else... But after paying for the full app it was so totally worth it. It kept lots of information that I put down. Name ideas, etc. kept track of my appointments. By far the best pregnancy app. It gives the option to reset it for when you have another one, but I don't even want to lol. This will be my first baby & she means to world to me.

This has given me a lot of insight on what to be expecting during these past few months, with this being my first child, I didn't have a clue what to ask doctors at OB Appointments, or what items to be looking for for the nursery. The pregnancy books are so mind numbingly tedious, and your OB usually has you in and out of your appointments in 5 minutes or less, it's great having this app to fall back on for information, and I love the new design!

We used all of the features on the app - names, hospital packing list, kick counter, contraction timer, dr appts, weight tracker, and others! It was worth every penny!

Few and subtle ads, no BS articles on “what to wear!?” and “the prettiest nurseries!”  This app has FACTS about what is happening to your body, exactly what part of your baby is growing, medical issues to be aware of, etc.  I feel confident and knowledgeable when I go to the doctor and already know what they’re talking about.

Title: Best pregnancy tracker I've found
----------------------------------------------------------
After I saw those little pink lines I downloaded every pregnancy tracker app I could find, including the two apps I already had accounts with because they were connected to the period and fertility tracker apps I had been using. I spent a little while getting to know all of the apps, and this was simply the best one. I almost never spend money on apps but I bought the premium version of this one. It is the only app I will be using for this pregnancy.

Title: Glitchy and horrible
----------------------------------------------------------
Decided to pay for the upgrade because it was the only way to get the contractions counter. First and only time I used it, it wouldn’t let me count anymore more than one contraction. Every time I pressed start for a new contraction it kept prompting me to delete my contraction history. I tapped no and it looped me back to press start again. The only way to start any contraction was to delete the history every time. Very frustrating. I want a refund.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
The contraction timer should allow you to time multiple contractions, but it will only save one session of contractions. The next time you go to time them, it will overwrite your last session. As the App developers, we do not deal directly with payment or distribution. Apple takes care of this on our behalf. Refund requests would need to be made through your App Store account. If you need any additional assistance with this issue, please contact our customer service team using the Feedback button in the More section of the App. We apologize for any inconvenience.

Title: Expecting Dads
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is simply amazing. Not only has this informed me more about the cycle of pregnancy and it has let me experience following week by week the approximate growth of my child. ( ex. They use veggies and fruits to show you how big the baby is.) there are very helpful articles about what symptoms you might be experiencing and why. Also there are many articles about staying active and fit throughout your or your partners pregnancy! Exceptional App!

Title: Love!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is my favorite pregnancy app. On my second pregnancy now and I wish I'd had it for my first. It's simple to use, uncluttered, and the animations of baby are incredible! I also love that there are actual sonogram photos week by week. I love the daily/weekly info and the option for journaling. Didn't think I'd use that part, but some days, ya just need a place to write down symptoms or feelings or cravings. Must have for all soon-to-be mamas!

Title: Must have app for pregnancy!
----------------------------------------------------------
This awesome app was the first thing I looked at every morning of my pregnancy for the great daily articles that always seemed applicable to my current questions or concerns based on how far along I was. It was the absolute best pregnancy app I downloaded, and I downloaded a lot of apps! Totally worth the money for the information, the pictures, and the timeline that shows you the progress and milestones you hit based on your personal due date.

Title: Great pregnancy app
----------------------------------------------------------
I've loved this app throughout my pregnancy. I've enjoyed the weekly updates. The information is always informative and helpful. Other helpful features: timeline of events throughout your pregnancy (ultrasounds, first kicks, tests), helps you track appts and weight progress. Overall I've enjoyed this app. You do have to play around w it at first to fully understand its features as it's not as intuitive as I would like but after that it's great.

----------------------------------------------------------
This is the only app I used religiously during my pregnancy with my first child. I just delivered the 18th! I loved seeing weekly progress and milestones my baby was making! I learned so much and felt so much more prepared than if I hadn’t used the app. It gave me insight on what to expect, things that were normal, things I should/needed to do, and even helped me pack my hospital and baby bag! Thank you to the creators for this incredible app!

So to some of you it’s your first pregnancy( like mine is) and it can get a bit of overwhelming to know what foods to avoid,how to excercise etc. Or maybe you want to have sonograms at Every doctor appointment but sometimes thier packed or it’s not time yet. That’s where this App comes along!! It gives you tips in Articles about your pregnancy and It shows an ultrasound on how the baby develops EVERY week! Did I also mention it’s Free?! 🤰🏻😍👌🏻

Title: Enjoyed weekly progress report
----------------------------------------------------------
The primary reason I purchased this app was to see pictures and read about my baby's development. It certainly has delivered on that objective. It's fun to read about what's next. It's also easier to hand this app over to my husband (versus a book) when he's curious. Possibly would have been more inclined to use other features if I had downloaded app at beginning of my pregnancy. Definitely would recommend this app to other expectant moms.

----------------------------------------------------------
I just downloaded this app, and I'm already loving it. As a first time mom-to-be, I love being able to see weekly pictures of fetal development, getting daily updates related to prenatal health and having the ability to track all things baby in one convenient place. The ability to add photos, count kicks, track weight and add doctors appointments is a great addition and adds a personal touch to this app. It's a one-stop-shop for mommies!

Title: Super Good Advise!
----------------------------------------------------------
I started on this app with the free trial and was impressed with the accuracy of the daily/weekly tips so I purchased the full version. As a first time dad, this app helps me get a better understanding of what's going on with my girlfriend and what I should be expecting in the following weeks. Also, the pictures help fill the void of how the baby is developing between the actual sonogram appointments. Great app, I highly recommend it.

Title: Love this app! But I have a Question!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is amazing! I love getting to see a 3D of what my baby looks like. The heartbeat comforts me even though it’s not mine. I love how it has the birthing plan and questions to ask the doctor. I do wish there was a spot to record answers to my questions but hey that’s what I have my notes for. My question is when it shows you the baby week by week, is it showing you what your baby is like at the beginning of the week or the end?

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks so much for the lovely review. The week number on the Today page is dynamic based on the settings. In Profile (upper right), scroll down to the Pregnancy section where you can decide if you want to see the 'current' or 'completed' week. The completed week will, for example, show week 5, when you are 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant. The current week will show you week 6, when you are 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant. The 'current week' setting is a bit like your birthday. When you are age 25, you are actually in your 26th year. You can tap the currently set week next to 'Show week' to toggle between the two. It's up to you which display you prefer to see. And the image displayed is the baby during that week. Hope this helps. If you have any other questions or concerns, be sure to let our team know. You can use the Contact us link in the App or email support@health-and-parenting.com

Title: I have a brown baby
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you! I deleted my other apps because my young kids were confused as to why the baby didn’t look like them. Especially because we have very dark skin. It made me sad. When I saw that this app had a diversity of babies I downloaded and to my surprise the app outside of just that feature is amazing. What foresight and consideration you all have . Thank you! I can’t wait to show my kids their developing sibling when they wake up.

I am a NEW Dad and I used this app to help me with the different stages of pregnancy that my wife was going through during her pregnancy. I began using this right from the beginning. Yes, you will have to pay for this down the road but it is truly helpful and educational. It is totally worth the $3.99. The weekly articles are the best and was looking forward to reading the updates every Monday morning. I highly recommend this app!

Title: Information without fluff
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is very informative- as most of the pregnancy apps are.  However this one is just so much "cleaner" in its look and usability. The classy version of tracking your pregnancy. I love the weight tracker and the list builders. Also, the feature to write your birth plan makes it so easy by just ticking boxes, and it's so easy for others to read. Just simple bullets. No wordy paragraphs that annoy medical professionals anyway.

I highly recommend this app and I will definitely use it again in future pregnancies.

It tells you what tests you will be doing at the doctor on a time line and info on the baby and things for mom to expect as well. It even tells the babies horoscope for birth. Every day it up dates with tips and how far along you are.

This app has everything! I love being able to show my family what the baby should look like, and how the baby is positioned inside of me. They help you with your birth plan and what you'll need to prepare for the baby and its nursery. They show you what you actually need instead of what people get extra that just make stores money. It makes me even more excited for my baby to get here and it satisfies my need to plan ahead!

Wow! Love this app! So helpful and informative. Love the shopping lists, and all the preparation tools. Every morning I wake up and read about exactly where I am in my pregnancy, look forward to it every morning! I think that this app has everything you need and is WAY more efficient then the others I have downloaded. The only thing I don't quite understand is why this app says the baby is so much smaller than other apps.

I really enjoy this app it has everything I could need all in one place. Very informative. This is my second pregnancy and my 6 year old loves to see the pictures of baby developing week by week. Worth paying the few dollars for the upgrade. My only concern is that it is a week ahead. I'm 5weeks 6 days and from the beginning of week 5 it's been giving me week 6 updates and so on but other then that I'm very happy with it!

My wife and I both loved this app. Being that this was our first baby we learned so much and looked forward to a new week passing, so we could read about what stage our baby was in and prepare accordingly. All the info matched up perfectly with what my NP mother would tell us so it's very accurate. We were hooked from week 1 all the way to week 37 and just welcomed our daughter yesterday. Wicked good app, good job guys.

Used thus throughout my first pregnancy and it's great! Totally worth the money after the first trimester! #1 best thing about the app is that many of us wonder what baby looks like! Every week this app shows what baby would look like on ultrasound and on 3D or 4D! I also like being able to record my belly size every month and the scale chart for weight as well as daily updates and not just weekly ones! Thank you!!
