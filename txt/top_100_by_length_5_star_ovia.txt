Title: So informational while keeping it fun and visual
----------------------------------------------------------
From the moment I found out I was pregnant up until this very moment with my son curled on my chest, I have found myself oh-so many times reading the updated and offered articles. The information readily available is pretty accurate down to the examples given and solution offerings. It was nice to see week by week what to expect and how to handle and now as he grows there‚Äôs new facts provided that reassure a new mom he‚Äôs on track (actually ahead of) but to know there‚Äôs others experiencing the same if not similar and learning and growing with their child as well. Without either of my parents to confide in, I depended on this app with any question or possible concern throughout my now; 10 month journey. Thank you kindly for this wondrous resource. Pray others find it and are able to enjoy as much!!! Definitely a 5 star and highly recommended app. (Which I have referred every expecting parent in my life)

Title: So in love with this app
----------------------------------------------------------
Since I have been pregnant with my little one this app has helped me out a lot. It is so informative that I feel like with each week as my baby grows I learn something each and everyday about my little one and it‚Äôs development. As a new mom to be I feel like this app gives me a piece of mind about everything as far as development of baby, the symptoms that I might experience that I might experience throughout each stage, sending me reminders for my doctor‚Äôs appointments. The articles they have for diet, exercise, recipes, and other useful things on the app. This is the only pregnancy app I‚Äôve ever had and I must say I‚Äôm glad that I did it right the first time, this app is amazing. I recommend this app to everyone that‚Äôs pregnant, you will not be disappointed and you will be well educated just like I am now!!! This app definitely has me looking forward to meeting my little one.

Title: Far and away the best pregnancy tracker!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is THE best pregnancy app! I think I have downloaded just about all of them, and this I‚Äôve outshines them all. On the calendar view page you can track pregnancy symptoms, moods, activities, record milestones, add doctor‚Äôs appointments + reminders, and create notes. There is charting functionality that pulls from the data entered on the calendar for weight gain/blood pressure/sleep/activity and more. There is also a wealth of articles and resources. The data you enter on the calendar creates a personalized feed on the homepage, which also includes baby‚Äôs daily development information. If you love data and tracking your pregnancy in a simple and extremely user-friendly app, but also want a wide variety of functions, this is the right one! Especially given that it is free! Compared to so many apps, the free functionality is completely awesome. Five stars!!

Title: Love love love üíï
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used this app for drs appointments and just tracking my pregnancy up until the day i gave birth to my sweet little boy!! I absolutely love that i was able to put my drs appts into the calendar and take notes in it. I would write my questions and concerns in the notes section and ask them at my next drs appt, it was just very helpful. I also love all the little facts they put in the timeline for how my son was developing in the womb and all the articles on pregnancy. I still use the pregnancy app for the articles and facts on the timeline for how he‚Äôs developing now in the world, i just wish they had the timeline with these facts and articles on the parenting app too. The parenting app is good too. I hope it gets updated though, so i can put his drs appt in the calendar and take notes to ask his drs, and then i can do the same for my son.

Title: Easy, basic, and I loved it my whole pregnancy!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôd been using the Ovia app for my period for years, so when I got pregnant I switched to the pregnancy app. It was so simple to use, and I loved the familiarity of the app having come from using their fertility app. The simplicity I think is what I really liked, simple but certainly enough! I loved the little images to show how big baby is compared to your hand or a seed per say. The little feet, it was a nice touch. I didn‚Äôt use the kick counter tbh because once I could feel my daughter kick, she basically never stopped moving. She was kicking so much it just didn‚Äôt make sense to try and record it all üòÖ. But anyways if you need the kick counter it works super great, and there‚Äôs all sorts of supportive and informational articles through the app that I appreciated. It helped me get my breast pump as well which was fantastic. Highly recommend!

Title: Most Informative
----------------------------------------------------------
Ovia doesn‚Äôt necessarily have all the excitement of articles everyday, BUT they have so many other helpful tools that other apps don‚Äôt. For example, their forum is the easiest to use. They also have a KICK COUNTER, CONTRACTION TIMER, MEDICATION SAFETY LOOKUP, FOOD SAFETY LOOKUP, and SYMPTOM LOOKUP. You‚Äôd have to download several apps usually to get those things and it saves you so many calls to your doctor about simple things like allergies and what‚Äôs safe to take. It really has way more than the other apps. It shows how baby is growing and comparative size. You can also choose what you want size compared to, cute little animals, veggies and fruits, pastries, or random. It has the weekly updates and information for multiples too! I really loved this app and many women don‚Äôt even know all the features it has. :) totally worth it

Title: First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a baby...
----------------------------------------------------------
I absolutely love this app! I use it everyday: when I first started to plan to conceive with my husband I was looking for an app that had more than just ‚Äúcute pictures‚Äù. I wanted an informative app that would truly guide me. Once we conceived (5 ways and 5 days ^_^) it became obvious that this was the app to have! I have the daily community which is amazing! You can upload your questions and feel thy you‚Äôre not alone because you instantly have replies from women who are going or went through everything you‚Äôre experiencing. You also have tips as to why to eat, so to work out, cleaning supplies around the house. You also have the amazing daily tracker of everything! How you‚Äôre feeling, what you‚Äôre feeling, BP readings, weight tracker and so much more! Don‚Äôt waste your money and time on these other apps!

Title: Best Pregnancy App Available!
----------------------------------------------------------
Currently 13w pregnant, and let me tell you, this is the best app I‚Äôve tried. Other apps have some cool features, but OviaPregnancy is all around great. Cool trackers, different themes, and good advice. There‚Äôs even a medicine and food safety lookup. And for day‚Äôs I forget to take my prenatal, Ovia reminds me in the app! Also, Ovia‚Äôs week by week sizing seems the most accurate to what a doctor might tell you. Other apps I‚Äôve used are all over the place with their sizes. Sometimes a week ahead or behind common size comparisons. I can‚Äôt believe this app is free. AMAZING. Used the regular Ovia app before getting pregnant, and I‚Äôll be using the Ovia Parenthood app for when baby is here. Not sure if that‚Äôs that exact name, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs an amazing app too!

Title: Best pregnancy app ever!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app gives you daily updates as well as weekly updates about your baby and about your body. It tells you what to expect and It‚Äôs so accurate.  You see weekly illustrations of what the baby‚Äôs growing body looks like and also it has little growth charts of hands & feet as well. I check the app everyday because I love seeing the daily updates of how the baby is evolving. It‚Äôs really neat and informative. You can check updates from the weeks ahead which is nice because I like to be prepared and you can track everything. I put all my appointments in the calendar for this app. The calendar is also convenient because you can skip ahead to certain dates and it will tell you how far along you will be at that time. Love this app and can‚Äôt recommend it enough!

Title: best pregnancy app, no click bait
----------------------------------------------------------
i tried all of the major pregnancy apps, and ovia is the only one i am still subscribed to and have on my phone at 8.5 months. all of the other apps constantly bombarded me with ads and click bait about the ‚Äú10 things you‚Äôre eating that are harming your baby‚Äù or ‚Äú5 things you need to stop doing NOW to have a healthy baby‚Äù. the ads were one thing, but the articles about what to do and not do on the other apps are often unsupported by medical literature. Ovia doesn‚Äôt try to give me anxiety about eating anything, shame me for not doing certain things, and doesn‚Äôt present me with information that is unsupported by doctors and the medical literature. i highly recommend this app for any mom that gets anxiety from all the click bait on the other apps.

Title: Awesome companion
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has been like a caring companion to me throughout my pregnancy. The style is kept light and friendly and is inviting. The interface is easy to use even though there are so many options. I love the ability to track daily stuff like emotions & symptoms in addition to food intake. I love seeing updates of baby‚Äôs size and a summary of what to expect each week.  The most impressive part has been the ‚Äúhealth coach‚Äù that periodically sends a message about general pregnancy topics but then actually talks to me when I reply back and offers advice on any questions. It‚Äôs hard to believe this is a free app! So many wonderful features that have been a great help and comfort through my pregnancy. Thanks Ovia for this good service you offer!

Title: My favorite
----------------------------------------------------------
Like probably every new mom, I downloaded multiple apps when I found out I was expecting. Ovia was one of two that I actually kept. I love the daily facts and emails as well as the weekly updates with so much insightful information. The hand and foot growth pictures are just too cute along with the size of baby. Being able to track every symptom, doctor visit and special moment is super helpful (especially when you‚Äôre experiencing pregnancy brain). My only negative is that we decided not to know the sex so we didn‚Äôt choose one in the app however it referred to baby as she more often than he - it would help if it mixed it up in the same read or used ‚Äús/he‚Äù. Aside from that I love it and can‚Äôt wait to see what it offers post pregnancy

Title: Best Pregnancy App
----------------------------------------------------------
Happy that I am a first time mother In the 20th century and get to be so well equipped  through my pregnancy with this awesome app. I was using the basic week update but now I‚Äôm 21 weeks and as I progress and have more planning to do I have just checked the app first to see if it provides what I‚Äôm looking for and it has 100% down to the Babylist registry. I‚Äôm happy I randomly found this on Apple store this would so much more work and stressful trying to find everything this app provides in different places. This is a one stop shop! Keep up the great work guys. I can‚Äôt think of  anything that needs fixing. I would suggest maybe adding a hiccup counter. I placed mine yesterday under kick counter but I noticed this won‚Äôt work for that.

Title: Ovia is the only pregnancy app to use, period!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used Ovia for all of my pregnancies! I‚Äôve literally been using Ovia for years and have never tried a different app because this one is just so great and has everything I need. While pregnant I can check it daily for updates on my baby, tips and healthy food options, and can track how I‚Äôm feeling, my weight, exercise and so much more. It really helps when your foggy pregnancy brain forgets things or when it‚Äôs been a few years since you had a baby and just need a refresher. I also really love the food safety look up! I use it constantly. This is seriously a woman‚Äôs best friend during pregnancy. Also check out their fertility app (used that with two of my pregnancies) and they‚Äôre parenting app! I couldn‚Äôt recommend Ovia more!

Title: Useful, helpful, fun, & cute!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I used the regular Ovia app not to track ovulation but only to track when I had my periods so I would know when it was coming, and understand when my moods would change during the cycle. When I marked I was pregnant (we weren‚Äôt really planning it but took a chance and it happens on the first try üò≥), the app brought me to the ovia pregnancy app. I loaded it and found that it was even more fun and cute than the regular app. You can decide your background colors, post your picture, nickname your baby a fun name, even choose if you want the app to show you the size of your baby in bakery food references or fruit references, or some other reference. I like it. It give you info daily also about the growth and development of the baby.

Title: Best app I've tried so far
----------------------------------------------------------
I used Ovia while TTC and I loved it and it truly helped me get pregnant. I was using many different apps including Glow and Ovia was the only one that let me adjust and personalize it to my cycles and changes. Other apps keep going back to 28 cycle days even though you change it. I have cycles of 50 days so I needed an app that let me personalize and understood and tell me what would happen in those 50 days. Now using the pregnancy app is so easy and fun and gives me a lot of helpful tips. It also helps me personalize it to set the weeks and time as my doctor calculates and not self calculate it based on 28 days. I love it and am so grateful to have the app! Can't wait to get up each morning to see what it new with my baby!!

Title: A fun resource!
----------------------------------------------------------
As soon as I found out I was pregnant I knew I wanted a cool app to keep track of everything. I found Ovia by just browsing through some of the top rated pregnancy apps and I absolutely love it. It‚Äôs such a fun and exciting way to keep track of your pregnancy with features such as a calendar to add doctor‚Äôs appointments, baby size/fruit comparisons each week, fun facts about baby‚Äôs development, and some incredible resources and articles. I‚Äôm nearing my due date and after using this app for the past 9 months I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm totally satisfied with what Ovia has to offer when it comes to following along with all the ups and downs of pregnancy and I‚Äôd recommend it to other women I know who are pregnant! It‚Äôs been a fun ride.

Title: Perfect!
----------------------------------------------------------
I used the regular ovia app for tracking my cycles & when I‚Äôm fertile. I struggled for years with a very harsh & unpredictable menstrual cycle. The app recommends so many different & helpful things to regulate your body or get to know it better. After about 6-7 months of using the regular Ovia app, I spent some alone time with my husband and found myself pregnant! These apps are amazing for every woman from every background. Happily tracking my baby‚Äôs growth, what to expect while my body changes & what to look out for as far as food & medications. It‚Äôs fun to involve my husband who is currently deployed! Makes things easier. Can‚Äôt thank the creators of this app enough for all of the help you‚Äôve given us!

----------------------------------------------------------
GettingPregnant young is very scary and you want to make sure you have all the information needed turn true that you have a healthy pregnancy and this app has by far been the best app I‚Äôve downloaded for this purpose. I had a miscarriage back in September and got pregnant again at the end of OctoberAnd this app has been a lifesaver. Not only can I track my babies growth but it also gives me tips and information I need on staying healthy both physically but also mentally and emotionally and it also gives me tips and gives me suggestions on what I could experience each week ofPregnancy so I‚Äôm not left in the dark I definitely will continue to use this for future pregnancies I love this app!

Title: Love it, but would love a new feature...
----------------------------------------------------------
I LOVE this app and the resources it provides!!! The food/medicine safety lookup has been a lifesaver, and the explanations of what‚Äôs going on with me and baby every week are awesome. One minor thing I would love to see, though, is the app keeping all of the photos that I post to keep track of my/baby‚Äôs growth. I don‚Äôt want to be the person who posts a new photo of myself on social media EVERY week, but I would love to still have the photos consolidated and saved somewhere so I can look back on them! So it would be awesome if there could be a feature that saves your progress photos each week. I know, I know, it‚Äôs a super nit-picky thing, which is why I still am giving the app 5 stars üíõ

Title: Best pregnancy app!
----------------------------------------------------------
It‚Äôs the cutest, most informative, and most easy-to-use pregnancy app. I tried many others, and kept coming back to this one. I used it way more religiously for the first 10 weeks, then slowly faded off as I became more and more comfortable with my pregnancy (: Now I use it for tracking my food intake, appointments, and the daily and weekly updates of how my baby is. The forum and posting segment of the app is great! Sometimes you get ladies who think they know everything, and will call you ABnormal or wrong for feeling what you‚Äôre feeling, but you just have to weed them out and look for the kind and helpful people. When I have issues or screws, they are always quickly answered.

----------------------------------------------------------
As I go through my pregnancy, from the very beginning this app has been spot on! From the growth (compared to my OBGYN appts.) to what I‚Äôm feeling and the progress. My family loves getting the weekly updates and it‚Äôs so easy to screen shot the home page with your update and weeks. It‚Äôs so cute to see the tiny baby hands and feet as they grow to what a newborns ‚Äúaverage‚Äù size comparison would be at birth. So tiny and sweet! Easy to log daily and check off that you are taking your pre-natal vitamin each day! I used the Ovia ovulation before this and was just as good, as we can tell - I‚Äôm pregnant! My husband and I are so excited for our first bundle of joy! Thanks Ovia!

Title: Third Pregnancy Best App Ever
----------------------------------------------------------
Every pregnancy I‚Äôm on the hunt for the right app to give me updates on my baby-mainly the veggie comparison and the weekly growth updates. At most, I would open the app once a week to check size but after the first trimester, it would lose its appeal. This app is so amazing that I check it everyday for its tiny one sentence updates on my baby‚Äôs growth. It asks me every morning if I took my prenatal the night before. It shows me baby size compared to baked goods, veggies, animals, and random stuff! The weekly growth updates are awesome and even have a multiples option if you‚Äôre having more than one baby! This app is seriously the best pregnancy app. 100% recommend.

----------------------------------------------------------
I am currently 25 weeks pregnant, and I just found this app, as I had been using others up until now. As soon as I opened it, and used it a couple times, I deleted all my other pregnancy apps. This one is by far the best! The videos are the most personable and relatable, and all of the information is presented in a fun and customized way! I especially love how they use your baby's name in everything they tell you! This app has SO much that the others don't, and it's a lot more relevant and modernized!! You won't need a handful of apps, just this one! I only wish I had found it at the beginning, but I look forward to using it for the rest of my pregnancy!

This app is easy to use and provides a lot of helpful information about each step of your pregnancy in a fun and understandable way. The ability to track data like your weight gain, your emotional and physical symptoms, as well as the special moments, such as the first time feeling baby kick, are so helpful, especially for a first pregnancy. I can not recommend this app enough ‚Äî especially after having a minor issue as a result of a phone software update when I thought I had lost all of the last 8 months of data I had logged. The Ovuline Support Team jumped right in and helped me to get my account back up and running with nothing lost!

It sets weight goals, sleep goals, and activity goals and helps ensure you‚Äôre your healthiest for you and your baby. I love the ability to jot down little notes, the medication safety lookup and the food safety lookup. There‚Äôs not a single thing about this app that I don‚Äôt enjoy or use to its fullest potential. Great app all the way! 12/10

Title: ABSOLUTELY LOVE but...
----------------------------------------------------------
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP. The only thing that my feelings vary towards is the community posting where you ask questions to other moms. There are a lot of negative nancies who make it seem like its impossible for certain stuff to happen just because it isn‚Äôt or hasn‚Äôt happened to them. Especially with moms who think they may be carrying multiples, and end up finding out they really are. Believe it or not, a lot of these women can kill your excitement and also discourage you. So if you decide to ask anything, just a warning to proceed with caution. You can take what they say into consideration but DONT LET THEM DISCOURAGE YOU!!!!!!

----------------------------------------------------------
I started using Ovia Pregnancy app when I found out I was pregnant. I was 3 weeks and 2 days. I love how even as early as that there are pictures to tell me what my baby looked like, at this time a lavender bud. Every day I am given information on how my baby is growing and what to expect. How to hand nausea and morning sickness is the big thing now. Genetic test are talked about and there is an area to ask questions and give peer answers to other moms going through same things. I can‚Äôt wait to continue using this app till my baby arrives and see what is happening daily. You can track symptoms, doctors appointments, and more too.

This is one of my favorite pregnancy trackers! I love all the features it has like the calendar that keeps track of weeks, doctors appointment, nutrition, activity, milestones like ultrasounds and kicks! This app truly lets you keep track of and helps you remember everything you need to in pregnancy plus it tells you all the new things about your little one and it gives you fun creative comparison objects outside the normal fruits and veggies everyone compares baby size to, although that is an option in there too, the only thing I don‚Äôt love about the app is the forum community part but even that would get 3/5 stars from me.

I absolutely love this pregnancy app. I‚Äôve used it for all of my pregnancies - including two miscarriages. I am so grateful for the features it has available for women who go through pregnancy loss. They planned a gentle and warm response to a very difficult time that prevented painful notifications and reminders. I used it all the way through my daughter‚Äôs pregnancy, and the naming feature, registry checklist, and kick counter were some of my favorite features! I recommend this app to all of my pregnant friends. Currently 17 weeks with a boy and grateful for the articles and information letting me know I‚Äôm right on track!

Title: Love this app but needs bump pictures!
----------------------------------------------------------
I really do love this app. I used the Ovia fertility app prior to this one so it was an easy transition. I downloaded 2 other popular pregnancy apps and this one is definitely my favorite. It‚Äôs well organized and filled with tons of good info. I especially love the easy food and medication safety look ups! If I have one complaint though it‚Äôs that there isn‚Äôt a good place to upload weekly bump pictures. You can upload pictures but they aren‚Äôt easy to find again and it‚Äôs not like the other apps where you can click on which week it is and upload a picture there to keep them organized. I.e ‚Äúweek one pic‚Äù ‚Äúweek two pic‚Äù etc.

Title: My favorite health tracker for pregnancy
----------------------------------------------------------
I used Ovia as my period tracker, and the regular app helped me identify my fertile window when we were trying to conceive. Now I‚Äôm 37 weeks pregnant, and I love using the Ovia pregnancy app. I love tracking my symptoms daily and being able to add little notes everyday, and that my data syncs to my Apple health app. I also love that the app creates graphs of my weight gain and blood pressure over the weeks. I read the weekly updates in addition to the free BabyCenter and What to Expect apps‚Äô updates. The anonymous community is also a major and unique plus of this app! I would recommend this app to all pregnant women!

Title: Ovia app review
----------------------------------------------------------
I had already downloaded and had been using a different pregnancy app when a friend of mine recommended Ovia. I loved how much the app had to offer. Being able to easily check what foods are okay to eat and which are not is one of my favorite parts of the app. Also how you can customize the app to what you would like is great. I have a 7 year old step son and being able to compare the size of the baby to an animal instead of a fruit or vegetable is fun for him. The app also randomly post questions for you to make sure you‚Äôre staying on track with your prenatals and other things. I would recommend this app to others!

Title: Great App
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app. I downloaded it based in the reviews and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. I love that I can login my food, exercise, mood, etc. It has allowed me to keep up with how I‚Äôm doing and what I need to improve. I also love the articles and suggestions made based on the information I put in. My husband and I can check it on our phones and makes him feel more involved and aware of how I feel and how I‚Äôm doing. The only tiny suggestion I have will be to include     month tags or milestones in the calendar. I like seeing the progress in weeks but in months would be nice too. Thank you for this app that is super helpful!

----------------------------------------------------------
This app is perfect! Every day it gives you advice on your pregnancy and how you‚Äôre feeling. You can also put dr‚Äôs appointments in, track health information, and look up certain medications to see if they are okay to take during your pregnancy. My favorite part is the community section. I spend hours a day posting and looking at post from woman all around. If I want to know something I can just post it and see if anyone can relate or has answers for whatever it may be. It also has a count down to how many weeks/days you have left. If you are looking for a good app look no further! I absolutely love having Ovia (:

This is my third pregnancy and I didn‚Äôt even hesitate to download this app. It is an amazing way tot rack your complete health though your pregnancy! I track my exercise, specific emotions and any symptoms and it makes prenatal appointments a breeze and easy to remember all my questions and give my midwifes detailed info on how baby and I are doing. Also cute images and little windows into how baby and you are doing week to week and fun articles to read. Lastly check out the food watch list on this app and you will always have an easy access list to remind you what is and is not safe to eat during pregnancy.

Title: Absolutely Perfect.
----------------------------------------------------------
After my first missed period I knew I was pregnant. My sister told me about Ovia because she had used it for her last pregnancy. So I downloaded and it was so informative about every step of the way. Unfortunately I was not able to get to the doctor until 4months so Ovia was my only source of information of what was happening. When I finally was able to be seen, Ovia was right on the money with just how far along I was and even had the exact due date! I highly recommend this app to anyone who‚Äôs pregnant especially new mothers who want a lot of insight on what‚Äôs going on and things they should be doing.

I downloaded this app 15 or 16 weeks in because I was using a different app that apparently was free only up till that time. I absolutely love this app and I love that I can keep track of not only weight and milestones but feelings and symptoms too. It makes it so easy to log everything. I can also connect my Fitbit to it to keep track of my steps and activities. I love that it gives you weekly sizes of the baby in 4 different groups. So it‚Äôs not only food but funny toys and animals too. It‚Äôs cute that it shows an actual size of the hand and foot on your screen for your weeks too. It‚Äôs just amazing.

----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve used Ovia for 4 years now with my first, then with my second, and with my third whom I gave birth to a couple days ago.. it‚Äôs such a great app! It asks if you‚Äôve taken your prenatal pill, how baby‚Äôs development is and how you‚Äôre body is changing , the best for me is the community chat, you can ask questions , concerns, or just simply vent and other women around the world with Ovia can reply, all while being anonymous and it‚Äôs so great to know you‚Äôre not the only one who goes through certain things and get so much comfort and reassurance. I love Ovia, thank you so much ! I recommend it 1000%

Title: A Must During Pregnancy!
----------------------------------------------------------
I found out I was pregnant a couple of weeks ago. My husband and I were doing natural family planning and were not planning on having a baby soon. When I found out I was pregnant, I freaked out and had a ton of mixed emotions. That same day I downloaded OVIA and instantly felt so much more at peace. It is everything I need in one app to make sure I am tracking and considering everything I need to know and more in order to have a safe and healthy pregnancy. It helps you feel connected and form a bond with your baby from the very beginning by tracking every developmental milestone day by day.

Title: My go-to Pregnancy app!
----------------------------------------------------------
This has been my go-to app during pregnancy! I also used Ovia to track my cycles before getting pregnant, so Ovia has been with me since well-before day 1! My favorite feature is the nutrition tips. I often found myself craving those foods a day or two before they would mention them, and their tips reinforced the idea that my body knew what it was doing and to trust my cravings. Love Ovia! I downloaded several other pregnancy apps just to try them all out, but Ovia Pregnancy has always been my favorite and is the one I always come back to. Thanks for being with me on this journey, Ovia!

----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded the app as soon as I found out I was pregnant with my second baby. I love the different themes, the daily information, and relevant articles to my pregnancy. The weekly size comparisons are adorable and help me connect with my son about the new baby. The medication and food lookups are awesome and very helpful. The only suggestion I have is to be able to save your own frequent medications, as you have to search daily if it‚Äôs not on the ‚Äúmost common‚Äù list, but that is a minor inconvenience. Overall, it‚Äôs exactly what I wanted in a pregnancy app and I‚Äôm glad I downloaded it.

This app worked great for me for the entirety of my pregnancy until it updated a week ago. I‚Äôm 39 weeks pregnant today and haven‚Äôt been able to use my contraction timer or kick counter I can‚Äôt even scroll down to see any new updates or see what size the baby is this week the app completely crashed when I needed it the most. It worked perfect for months then come 38-39 weeks of my gestation it completely stopped working. It‚Äôs an overall great app which is why I continued to use it as my pregnancy tracker throughout my entire gestation but now when I need it the most it doesn‚Äôt work.

This is by far one of the most amazing apps I‚Äôve ever used. It has many different components in one app. It give you daily updates on what‚Äôs going on with the baby, how big it is, and what is important for you as the mother to do to make sure your baby can develop at its best. It gives you an area to explore names and it allows you to assort them in which ones you like love and don‚Äôt like. It gives you a checklist for you to have when leaving the hospital. It even allows you to speak with other pregnant women. Highly recommend. Would not recommend any other app for pregnant women.

If I could give them 6 stars I would! I have used a number of different apps but this one is my favorite by far. We used Ovia when ttc and it was great, got pregnant so quickly! And the pregnancy app is just as good. I like the personalized articles with real scientific evidence for every day of my pregnancy. And I love the option to track my health, nutrition, exercise, doctors appointment, milestones, EVERYTHING you could want to track all in one app. If you are pregnant, or thinking about getting pregnant, Ovia is the best choice out there. And it‚Äôs all for free!!! Thanks Ovia!

The accuracy of each stage, the weekly hand and foot prints of the actual size, the weekly videos, advice and guidance, things you didn‚Äôt consider that are helpful, insurance information, maternity leave information, dietary, contraction tracker, just to name a few. This is priceless information. Excellent resource and a flood gate of information. If I could if 10 stars I would. Hahaha

It‚Äôs really helpful to have tidbits about baby‚Äôs development as it relates to the stage of pregnancy but also as a result of information I input. I use the data side of the app daily and just love to check each week and see what size baby is now and how much their hand/feet have grown! It‚Äôs also a great resource to break the ice on some topics and read brief articles that then I can remind myself to write questions from for my appointments. I haven‚Äôt reached labor yet but I know the timers are going to be clutch!

When I got pregnant with my first child in 2018 I tried so many pregnancy tracking apps but I found that Ovia was the best one for me.

And all of the articles really helped for concerns that I might have had about my growing baby and gave me great things to ask my doctor about. I love the app so much that I used it for my second child and now I‚Äôm currently using it because I just found I was pregnant with my third so thanks Ovia for being an app I can count on

I really enjoy this app compared to when I was pregnant 7 years ago when I would have to look at the internet and search all over for info each week of pregnancy. This app has good info for each week and it has been so fun to be able to see what size my baby is each week and that you can choose the theme of what you want them to compare the size of your child to. This app is also very helpful because it reminds you to take prenatal vitamins and there is a place to put in all of the info/stats for each appointment do you can see your progression. I love this app!

This app has been well worth the download. I started out with Ovia fertility which really helped pin point when my periods were (not a person that ever tracked) to my bbt, weight etc. loved it! So when I found out I was pregnant, it seemed clear to me to download ovia pregnancy also. It‚Äôs kept my dates clear on when I had appts. to little notes about random things. One of my favorite features of this app is the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù where you can ask questions and read other peoples questions with quick responses And vote on them. It‚Äôs fun, interesting and also helpful.

When I found out I was pregnant, I had been using the Ovia fertility app, to track my cycle and ovulation, and it suggested the ovia pregnancy app, and of course, I downloaded at least 5-10 other pregnancy apps to see which was best and Ovia is the best by far! From the info week by week, little tidbits of info that is really interesting about the baby‚Äôs development, the ability to track so many different symptoms, milestones, appointments, ultrasound pictures, notes about anything like telling family/friends, baby bump pictures...it‚Äôs hands down the best!!!

Great app! I‚Äôve learned a lot from this app. It gives great insight on how your baby is developing and common symptoms a mother will feel during stages of pregnancy. Some of the articles are amazing to learn from like dieting- they give examples of a daily meal plan. I just wish they had a quick reference tab or mark as favorite- for these types of topics to be easily found. If not, you have to try to recall where the article was and scroll to find it again. That would be a great update for the markers of this app. Other than that, I‚Äôve enjoyed this app!

There is also a setting for if you‚Äôre having multiples as well! All in all 5 stars!

After I quit using the depo shot as birth control (highly recommend avoiding depo) I didn‚Äôt have a period for around 8 months. When my periods did start they were so irregular and were hard to track. Ovia made it so easy to track them until the regulated back out. Then when I got pregnant the pregnancy tracker was full of details about baby, my body, tips, healthy recipes, etc. The parenting app helped keep track of milestones my baby should be hitting. Overall I highly recommend these apps and have used them for all three of my pregnancies.

Make it to where we can add groups and such and feel more like a ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù.  While keeping the anonymous if anyone wants to use it. Just think that would be cool- either way, it‚Äôs a super good app and I would recommend to everybody

Every time I recorded anything in my daily notes, the app would keep changing my ovulation date and my whole Fertility window was off. I know because I was tracking my ovulation daily with clear blue electronic ovulation kit. Finally I came across Ovia and the dates as well as my fertile window were accurate. Now I‚Äôm using the Ovia pregnancy app and keeping track of everyday changes in my pregnancy. It‚Äôs easy to use and gives lots of helpful info daily.

I have tried several pregnancy apps but honestly this is the only one I kept and the only one you need. It is both inspiring and informative.

Ovia is a perfect balance, with inspiring information as I tracked my food and activity intake, a helpful food safety and medication lookup, and articles relating to whatever pregnancy symptom or area you are worried about. Get Ovia, you precious momma, you!

I‚Äôve just had my first embryo transfer and downloaded a slew of free pregnancy apps and this is the one for IVF moms.

It‚Äôs also not spammed full of ads (although there are some.) It told me what was developing with embryo, when implantation should be taking place and completed, when I should be able to take a pregnancy test, etc.

I bought three pregnancy books when I found out I was pregnant. Ovia has completely replaced two of them bc it all all the information I could possibly need. It successfully combines pregnancy advice with a safe medications and foods database. I can also personalize my baby‚Äôs growing journey by naming it and answering questions that let Ovia tailor my feed to what I need to know. It‚Äôs just a great app. And I love the daily emails telling me new things about my baby and new tips and tricks to make pregnancy better.

I have downloaded and tried several different pregnancy apps, and I can definitely say this is by far my favorite. It is very helpful in many ways but unlike other pregnancy apps, this one updates daily with new information. As long as you refresh the page every once in a while, new information shows up. Other apps update weekly. But now that I‚Äôm on a review, if you want to see the actual development of your baby within the womb, ‚Äúpregnancy+‚Äù has the best 3D photos of the fetus, your belly, and example sonograms.

I love reading each week and it includes my baby‚Äôs name and the real gender. It‚Äôs super easy to use which I like as well, some apps are too complicated and have too much going on. What I look for in a pregnancy app is weekly development updates, growth patterns, and customizability and this app has all three! Exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for. 100% recommended this app!

Title: First Pregnancy - All info in one place!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is my first pregnancy and I‚Äôm so excited. I downloaded every pregnancy app I could find and this one is, by far, my favorite. I love the easy health tracking, including mood, physical symptoms, medications, food and water intake, and even blood pressure! This will come in very handy at appointments. Oh! And the app helps you track appointments (and notes for the doctor) as well as pregnancy milestones (like telling your family). It even has a place to write in potential baby names. I love this app.

Title: Best app I‚Äôve ever used.
----------------------------------------------------------
Throughout my pregnancy I‚Äôve tried a lot of different pregnancy apps but Ovia Pregnancy is the one I stuck with. I found myself always going to this one out of all the other ones because it‚Äôs easy to use, it‚Äôs fun and you can make it personal. I love how you can make a theme and early on change it according to the gender of your baby. This app is so informative and helpful in any way possible. The part I enjoyed the most though is watching baby‚Äôs foot and hand grow! Thanks for making this app so great.

Title: Outstanding app for expecting moms
----------------------------------------------------------
My sister-in-law recommended this app while my husband and I were trying to conceive (Ovia Fertility) and also once we found out the wonderful news that we were pregnant (Ovia Pregnancy). Being a first time mom obviously comes with many questions and concerns. Without having to search the internet for answers, Ovia conveniently provides daily and weekly information pertaining to both mom and baby. I have been able to have a piece of mind and thoroughly enjoy each step of my pregnancy thanks to Ovia.

----------------------------------------------------------
This is my first baby so I really didn‚Äôt know what to expect. This app has been really helpful in explaining the different changes and symptoms that come with being pregnant. I love the food lookup feature to see what‚Äôs safe and what‚Äôs not and the delivery countdown. I also really look forward to the weekly baby updates and description of what the baby may be doing. I check the app everyday honestly. The different articles are interesting too and tailored to fit you personally. Definitely recommend.

Title: Themes
----------------------------------------------------------
My SIL suggested this app to me since this is my first pregnancy. I already had found 3 pregnancy apps that I preferred, but I went ahead and installed this app just to say I tried it. When I actually gave it a chance, it became my favorite app. I LOVE the feature that allows you to change the theme and choose how to compare growth of your baby. To me, fruits and vegetable sizes are vague as they can vary so much.. so comparing size to animals makes it more relatable. Please don't change anything :)

As soon as I made my registries, there were lists and Top 5 apps I should‚Äôve downloaded from the beginning !! I went a little to overboard and downloaded them ALL üòÇ some will say but out of all the apps I do enjoy Ovia the most! I love the updates it gives me about my baby size, it‚Äôs really helpful when you use the health track and different sources in the app pops up and reminds of you of what the app has so you can cope -if you‚Äôre a mom whose been stressing and been a little more than sad lately.

Title: Ovia Apps
----------------------------------------------------------
I used the Ovia Fertility app to help track my cycles while going through infertility treatment. Now I am 28 weeks pregnant and have been using the Ovia Pregnancy app. It was a easy transition and has been so informative. Every day there is something new to read about your baby. I love to track my different symptoms and instantly be given a little blurb on what‚Äôs going on in my body. I also use the share button on articles and highlights of how my baby is growing to send to my family and husband.

Title: Great for 1st Time Moms
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm a first time mom and to say that I‚Äôve been overwhelmed by information is an understatement. The Ovia app is simple to use and is very informative. There are recommended articles every day and the feature to log your appointments, health, moods etc. Is my favorite part of this app. I feel like I can easily navigate the information but also love that I can always go to any date on the calendar and log how I‚Äôm feeling and any symptoms I may be experiencing. Simple, easy to use, and very helpful.

This is my second pregnancy and it‚Äôs crazy to think of how much you can forget between each one. It‚Äôs a great tool for tracking the differences in my pregnancies having a place to keep track of my symptoms and questions to take to my doctors appointments! I wish this app would remind you of your questions before your appointment without having to write them on the date of your next appointment. Overall I love every little bit of this app and will use it again and again for all of my pregnancies

This is the first time I‚Äôve ever used Ovia I was using another app but found some of the info on that app to be false or contradicting so I switched over to Ovia. I love it üòä I started using the app at 9 weeks currently 32 weeks, and if I get pregnant again this will definitely be the app I choose to work with love the weekly updates and daily updates on baby. The videos Gina makes are awesome I feel like everything she says has so much impact on how I see things in my own pregnancy! Love Ovia

I‚Äôm a first time mom and while there many apps out there friends and family members suggested I chose Ovia! This app has been amazing! I love reading new information each week in my pregnancy. Additionally, I love the little baby facts, health related information and nutritional information they include on the timeline daily. I would love to see my baby growing with my actual eyes but obviously that‚Äôs only possible with an ultrasound but this app makes it easy to track my baby‚Äôs development!

I truly enjoy using this app. It has helped me to track my ovulation and now that I am pregnant, I am able to track my pregnancy. I use this app daily to see how baby is growing, what symptoms I will be experiencing, etc. I use this app in conjunction with The Bump and What to Expect When Pregnant and this app is my fav out of the three. My fav feature is the calendar where it tracks for me how many weeks I am. I schedule my appointments there as well. I would recommend this app to everyone!

----------------------------------------------------------
Love. Love. Love! Everything about this app is great! Tons of useful information, tips and fun facts - great for knowing how your growing baby is developing and how your body is changing. It tracks not only your trimester and weeks (with a countdown), but also has trends for your weight gain, sleeping habits and much more. The food safety section is great for those who love a wide variety of foods, but maybe haven‚Äôt had to think about how it could affect baby. Can‚Äôt say enough good things!

This is the best app ever invented!!! There have been so many times I almost went over the edge with my worry & concern over my growing baby, but have no fear Ovia is here!!! It is beyond accurate, every single week was spot-on, so eerily accurate I even cried watching Gina's videos bc I knew everything I was experiencing was perfectly normal! I LOVE OVIA!!! I recommend to every pregnant/expecting mother or any woman even WANTING to become a mother just to prepare her for the journey! üòòüòòüòò

I check this 3-6 days a week! I was told to check this app out by one of the nurses that works at my doctors. I love everything about this app. There are so many useful features that I have yet to explore and use more. I love the daily and weekly updates and information it provides on your growing baby! I am currently 22.5 weeks along. I‚Äôve enjoyed sharing the weekly growth info to my partner so he knows what myself/mommy is going through and what our baby is up to! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

I LOVED the community feature. I asked questions and answered questions a lot! I was able to look back on my posts for my baby book which was a plus! I also used the edge park ad on the app for my FREE Medela breast pump so that was really helpful! I recommend this app for any first time mommy!

Oh my god I love this app this app has helped me so much.  I would definitely recommend this app to all pregnant mamas!  I have no hate towards this app at all it is all good thoughts.  What I love most about this app is that all the mamas are all anonymous and we can ask each other questions all the time and help each other out.  This app has things that will make you question shouldn‚Äôt you be paying for something like this? But you aren‚Äôt and that is what i love about this app.

Really the best app ! I used another one unltil I seen Ovia on a Facebook ad, and it's really so helpful! Being able to ask other moms questions, if you are worried , and to share your journey is really exciting, and stress relieving. Also being able to track your pregnancy so well , is great! Download it ! Only wish that they made it so you could post a picture along with an anonymous status! That way it would be another thing you could share with the moms! Amazing app though!

This app literally gives you so much information. It can tell you what foods are and aren‚Äôt safe, it can tell you the cause of symptoms you might be having, it tells what‚Äôs going on with your baby throughout the week and how big he/she is. And keeps track of how many weeks you are.  It also has a kick counter and contraction timer. It also can tell if you if certain medications are safe. I was recommended this app and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is pregnant.

I use this app and another pregnancy tracker app, but this is by far my favorite! They give you daily updates on what your baby is doing and even about how you may be feeling. You can input your symptoms and health history. They have helpful articles, and they also have a place where you can check to see if the food and medicine you are eating and taking is safe or unsafe. For a first time mom I really love this app and will recommend to anyone I know who becomes pregnant.

I loved using the app while I was pregnant and now that my little one is here I use their parenting app! The info included (medication and food safety lookups and quick articles relevant to where you‚Äôre at along the pregnancy) and fun facts such as comparing the size of baby to animals/produce/toys depending on your preference were great and not too long winded. I appreciated that they include references at the bottom of each article to show where the info came from too!

This is such a great app for expecting parents! Easy to use and understand and has so many features that you can utilize! It tracks development and gives you a daily update, it can also time your contractions when you go into labor. I mostly use it to track development for not just the baby but myself and what to expect as a mom while carrying the baby but it will also track your appointments, moods, mental health, what you eat, etc. This app is an all in one for me!

A ton of tracking features like tracking your weight, water consumption, diet, kick counts, even more stuff than I could imagine tracking. Lots of helpful information too! I love seeing the size of the baby‚Äôs hands and feet on the home page. Overall I‚Äôd definitely recommend this app over any others I‚Äôve tried!

If you‚Äôre looking and aren‚Äôt sure just download it and try it out to see which one you like üòä

I was using ovia fertility to track my period as well as my temperature so I could tell when I was ovulating and when I wasn‚Äôt...I finally logged my daily stat and the app told me to take a pregnancy test which I did I was pregnant. I then transferred to ovia pregnancy and so far it‚Äôs been a marvelous app with helping me to keep track of everything...I‚Äôm almost at the finishing line just 4 more weeks to go and I‚Äôm very pleased with this app. Highly recommendable.

I had a couple friends who used Ovia for their pregnancies and I thought I would give it a try when I found out I was pregnant. It‚Äôs our first baby, so it‚Äôs been soooo cool seeing the developments each week, with the neat little graphics and size comparisons. I look forward to each week seeing what the next stage of development will be for my lil Munchkin! It‚Äôs also full of insiders and tips. Very useful, I open the app every day, several times a day! I ‚ù§Ô∏è Ovia!
