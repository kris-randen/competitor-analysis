Title: Glucose Buddy made a scary situation easy.
----------------------------------------------------------
Four times a day this app is a welcomed source of continuity, inspiration and a desire to learn more about diabetes. This is the ONLY thing that has been easy from the first second I opened the app. May 2018, my 76yo Mom was at the ER. She didn’t know my name, mumbled and had major balance issues. It wasn’t a stroke but the result of her poorly managed T2D. After three weeks split between hospital and a rehab facility, we were back at the ER due to another episode. She was released 3am on Memorial Day with no access to her GP nor regular pharmacy, with confusing/ conflicting scripts for 3 types of insulin, new meds, and a freaked out daughter pretending to be calm. Desperate for an app that would help me, I found this one. The reviews and easy to comprehend screen shots sold me. Even negative or less than stellar reviews seemed to be constructive and many had replies. During this new journey with my Mom, this is the ONLY thing that has been easy. Having no clue what basal or bolus was, I entered her Humalog insulin and began recording. As things settled down and a routine was established, I decided to pay the yearly subscription and dug deeper into what this app offered. Our GP was now on vacation but called and wanted to see Mom’s glucose levels. Mom was prepared to write it all out in an email and was relieved when I simply sent a report from the app. Our GP was relieved and impressed. We’ve since talked more about the app and both like how the simplicity of entering items on the patient’s side doesn’t detract from the detailed report that he as a doctor reads. As I now know what basal and bolus mean, I was able to go back and easily edit previous entries. The more we use this app, the more we are inspired to learn new ways to live with diabetes. This app is now on Mom’s iPhone in addition to mine. She is actively becoming more involved in entering her own information and even prepping and using her glucometer. Glucose Buddy has given her tools and a sense of feeling in control. As she gets three shots of Humalog a day and now uses a Lantus pen at night, this app has helped to establish a routine that has inspired new eating habits. She even carries her iPhone more now than before so she can record her steps. It’s a win win for everyone! We’re all enjoying a healthier Mom that wants to use her iPhone and has it with her for calls and FaceTiming. Thank you!!!

Title: Back on Track =)
----------------------------------------------------------
I just wanted to say a big THANK YOU for creating this app. It's been wonderful and such a help. I was diagnosed Type 2 in 2006. I started doing everything as I was supposed to, logging my food, logging my activity, logging my meds... after about 6 months into it my life got a little more hectic and i kept forgetting my notepad. At the time I logged everything by pen & paper. Eventually I started forgetting my notebook, eating on the go, forgetting my meds, etc... Well 2 months ago my old Treo started dying a slow death. I started phone shopping and my husband & my sister were both iPhone 3G owners so they kept pushing the iPhone. I was so against the iPhone just because it was so mainstream and everyone around me had one. One day as I'm watching the 2 of them talking about apps & seeing the commercial saying they got an app for everything, I started to wonder... I already had an iTunes account so I went looking for a diabetes management app. Sure enough I found Glucose Buddy, and much higher rated than even paid apps!! I went out and bought an iPhone3GS that day and Glucose Buddy was the first app I installed =)

Title: The Best and Effective So Far
----------------------------------------------------------
As a newly diagnosed Type 2 I was very much concerned and interested in finding just the ideal app that would let me log my data, show me results immediately and something I could share with my Doctor at each visit.  I believe I've found it!  This app is not only user friendly but let's me visually see my results.  I especially like the graphs, the entries are easy to use and I can take a snapshot of my progress anytime.  The "topper" was the website and how I can access it from any computer and I can sync it with my IPhone!  One drawback that I can not award five stars is that my web entries do not sync to my IPhone but I can sync my IPhone logs to the website no problem.  That is confusing and lack of info when I want to share my data with my Doctor via my IPhone.  Log data on website does not match log data on IPhone.  On the biggest upside to this entire package is that it is all free both the IPhone app and membership to the corresponding site!  Free is good and this app is as well.  I will be looking for further updates, I really love this app!!

Title: Love this program
----------------------------------------------------------
Diabetes is tough, but Glucose Buddy 3.0 makes keeping track of the details easier. I've been using GB since version 1.0. It continues to improve and grow. Support is excellent and they listen to ideas and fix any issues. The new version allows you to choose more than one food or medication at a time. The application also loads faster than before. Now you can enter a numeric value for your glucose reading instead of rotating a dial. Adding entries is quick and easy. The log file has changed and is wider so the different colors for meds, food, activity and glucose do not show and the sorting capability is gone. Being able to sort the different types was very useful to me so I hope they add that back. While the graphs were removed this version, to me the more useful graphs are online. Putting the buttons on the bottom and having the application open to the log screen would also be good. I highly recommend this application. They are always working on improvements and it's still free. Thanks GB!

Title: Best available
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm a type 2 diabetic with large gl fluctuations. I tried all the free/lite iPhone monitoring tools and have found this one to be the best for the one most important reason to me ease of use. It has a no help needed user interface. Entering the basics 3 to 5 times a day has to take minimal effort or I won't use it. You can easily email the log to your doctor. You can also take a snapshot of the gl graph which is a good companion to the log so your doctor can zoom in on food and activites or lack thereof on the dates in your log that had the most fluctuations or highest gl. Your log can be synchronized with the server so you get the sense it won't get lost if something happened to your phone. I don't have any experience with recovering after a lost phone but the sync always goes smoothly for me. It's certainly fast with a wifi connection which I have at home.

----------------------------------------------------------
I just wanted to say Thank You!!! Life as a person with diabetes is not easy, especially with Type 1, it is a huge balancing act of not to eat too much, too little, too this, too that.  Physical activities have to be planned out ahead of time and insulin/food has to be calculated accordingly.  One miscalculation in my 5 shots/day and my entire day could be ruined.  But your tool makes life a bit easier to deal with.  I always have my iPhone with me, and don't have to worry about carrying a log book around.  You graph things out, and allow me to dissect the information I've entered - all the stuff I used to do manually with excel.  Now you've made that part of diabetes control automatic and easier - and for that, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart.  Please continue helping us.

Title: Logging levels
----------------------------------------------------------
Controlling BS is challenging. Working with your medical medical is vital for better BS control which require sometimes showing how your BS runs during a certain periods of time, all the time. This app is GREAT because it allows you to put it down immediately, it's put on graphs of your BS and makes a running list of when taken and add notes so when you go to see your physician, it's right in the palm of your hands to help you in in communicating your diabetic needs. Many like myself put forth an effort to keep good records but for some reason, you forget your log book on the day of your appointment, this app will allow you to be better prepared to show your doctor your logs and be ready to get the needed help for making the needed adjustments more accurately.

Title: Awesome whole lot better than onetouch ultra smart
----------------------------------------------------------
I just bought the onetouch ultra smart to keep up and log every little thing but this is way better. I also have the mini and never use it because I couldn't log it in the ultra smart. The founder being diabetic himself is what makes this app and future updates of this app so good. It's great that it is free now as I would have paid for it. Only suggestion would be a food database and place to put total calories and grams of fat carbs and protein. Maybe also ability to log glucose and insulin on same entry if it was taken at same time. It is awesome that it syncs to the website and can be emailed or printed. My doctor is going to love this because I HATE keeping up with my readings but this will make it so much easier. THANK YOU!!!

Title: #1 fan of glucose buddy
----------------------------------------------------------
This program has been the key to sucess in managing my diabetes. I have tried several other diabetes apps, this one has it together. My physican and dibetes staff can log in my acct anytime to check on my status and help me maintain perfect control. I would gladly pay $$$$ for this program anyday. No paper logs for my doc anylonger. It would be nice to have an option for a note field only, on main screen to describe health or other items your experiencing. Currently I have to list under the (4) standard options (glucose,meds,food,activity), also if this could allow you to add oral medication with mg doseage it would be great. Overall I recomend this to any diabetic. If I had an option for 10 stars

Title: Great app
----------------------------------------------------------
As an active 21 y.o. Diabetic, o  always looking for something to work well with my lifestyle.. This integrated with the calorie tracker has really helped me as long as I stick with using it... The only part that is hard is finding the food from the grocery store in the app.. I tended to just make them in the favorites list and input the nutrition info myself.. You only have to do it once and then it's saves it :)... It would be easier if you could search it by different categories (for ex. "English muffins" and then all the English muffin brands would come up... If they were in order then you could also use that to find the lowest carb english muffins for example.. Just a thought :D)

This is a fantastic app.  Extremely professionally done, great graphics and very simple to use.  I have had it for several months and when I have had a question or two the support is almost immediate and superb.  I can not recommend this app strongly enough. And to top it all off it is free.  An app this well done could go for some serious coins if the owner so wished.  Mega congrats to him in trying to help us with this disease. The ability to sync the data to a web site is great too. The sync issue mentioned previously appears to be fixed and I got immediate response from their support in this regard. I have seen few sites to respond so qiuickly to a reported issue.

Title: Works Well On My IPhone 4s
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using this app a few weeks ago and also got the weight program.  Sometimes it will not let me connect to the server when I sync but it does at a later time, so no big deal.  I like the data and graph, but they could be improved.  The data should be able to print full comments.  The graph should print larger and the advertising pop up should not blocking any parts of the graph when printed.  I like the program and use the free app.  I don't want the paid app and refuse also to pay an annual fee.  I give it a 5 for its ease of use and would like to see these minor items fixed. If they want to keep the fee ok, but one time only like most other apps.

Title: Love this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I never gave a crap about my diabetes until I lost both of my parents at the age of 51. They both were diabetic and although that wasn’t necessarily the cause of their death as my dad had cancer and my mom had an upper GI bleed along with other issues it certainly did not help. My A1C was out of control at 10.2! Here I was downing mountain dews and never checking my sugar eating whatever I wanted. I gave up sodas, and fast food but finally have started checking my sugar as well. My endocrinologist has requested that I check my sugar randomly throughout the day and keep a record... well it has finally happened because of this app! 💕

Title: Truly Awesome App
----------------------------------------------------------
Updated Review:  Since my last review, which was nearly a year ago, I continue to be a big time fan of this application.  The advent of the A1C calculation has allowed me to keep really accurate check on where I am over any given 90 day period.  Therefore, there are never any surprises when I go into the doctor for my blood work every 6 months and I have found the calculated A1C results to be nearly identical to the lab.  I have been and continue to be an extremely well controlled diabetic of 20 years but this is the best tool I have ever had to assist me in staying healthy.  Thanks GB for such a GREAT application.

Title: Easy and Flexible with Exceptional Data Interpretation...The Best!
----------------------------------------------------------
Congratulations on the development of a wonderful, easy-to-use, complete tracking program for those of us with Diabetes.  I have been using Glucose Buddy for nearly 4 months now and I wanted to take a moment to say how much I appreciate the application.   I am an analytical person that would enter my data into an excel spreadsheet each week and run a variety of plots to identify trends, look for opportunities to improve my control, and simply do a better job of understanding my bodies ability to accommodate sugar.  Sure there were lots of programs to record data but those were very weak with respect to analysis.

Title: GB A1C checks out perfectly with lab results
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using Glucose Buddy for several months now, and I recently went to my doctor for my three month checkup.  I thought to go online and run the GB A1C prior to going in, and also printed the log out to show the doc.  I told him what I was doing, and that GB predicted my A1C at 7.08%.  The doctor doubted the results stating that patients with my control level and medicine dosage, not to mention my history, are above 8%.  Never the less, he jotted down the Glucose Buddy A1C estimate.  When the lab test results came back, they were EXACTLY as Glucose Buddy predicted.  Hats off to Glucose Buddy!

Title: Perfect for managing Gestational Diabetes
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a great app! I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes and had to learn how to live with testing and tracking very quickly. Glucose Buddy was easy to learn and use. I had to report my levels to my doctor weekly and it was very easy with the reports I could generate with Glucose Buddy. It would have been much harder for me to control my gestational diabetes without this app, I would have never been able to keep so organized. I gave birth to a healthy, 7lb6oz boy and I am certain that has everything to do with keeping on top of my diabetes because of Glucose Buddy.  So thank you so much!

Title: Glucose buddy is a real Buddy
----------------------------------------------------------
Well with me it is so awsome! I have my phone at hand all the time, I don't always have a pin or my log book. I really love the buddy for logs and I can send it to my Doctor too . This is a really big help because I get really absent minded and It helps me keep organIzed ! Thanks so much. One thing I would add is, the ability to save notes without a glucose test . It's not possible at this time. Sometimes I get caught working away from my meter and am unable to test at that moment and would like to note it. But other than that I love this app. If not for the app, I'm really a bad log keeper.

Title: Ease and graphs are a plus!
----------------------------------------------------------
A type II diabetic for 8 years, I was beginning to get lazy about taking my readings.  My last doctor visit proved how dangerous this had become.  My A1c level had risen significantly. Shocked by how much in as little as 3 months, I quickly went looking for an app to help keep me on track.  I really like the ease of entering in my readings and the correct descriptions  that correspond to each.  It has worked because it has provided a better visual of how I am doing and has encouraged me to continue to stay in my correct range. Ease and graphs are what make this app a good choice.

----------------------------------------------------------
Although I am not new to diabetes because my parents are both diabetic. But me personally, I am new to diabetes. The glucose buddy has helped me tremendously. I was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. And glucose buddy has made it pretty simple to record everything. Food, blood sugar, I even put my blood pressure in the notes. I always have my glucometer with me, as well as my iPhone, so it's pretty easy for me to keep track. The emailing of charts is simple. I can send it to my wife, doctors, parents, anyone really. This program has made this transition easy for me. Thank you.

----------------------------------------------------------
I'm so happy I found this app. I paid a ton for Diabetes Pilot, which was not very good at all, then found this much better free app after the fact. Go figure. I'm a Type 1 diabetic and this has been great for me. It's really easy to enter all of my data. Everything is categorized nicely and the program is really easy to navigate. It's also great that it syncs with their website, which provides even more detailed graphs and other information. The website gives you your highs/lows/avgs for a variety of different scenarios such as: time of day, meal, etc. This app is fantastic!

Title: Great App!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using this app in February 2019. My A1C at the time was 8.6 and my proteins were over 600. I started tracking everything with this app and A1C is 6.8, protein is at 30, and I have lost 30 pounds. I went from 55 units of insulin to 30. Saw my Dr yesterday and she said drop to 25 units. When I go to the Dr. she can see all me glucose readings for the month. I love that with a few clicks she can see blood pressure readings, steps, or anything else this app tracks. I recommend this app to everyone I meet with diabetes. It was well worth the money!!

I have 2 children ages 5 and 7 both are type 1 diabetics. We test every 2 hrs  10 to 12 times daily for each child.  This app has made it so easy to keep up with the hundreds on numbers we input and email to our endocrinologist every 3 months. both of my children's a1c levels are between 6.0 and 6.5 every 3 months. This is a must have app if your serious about tight blood control.  The only thing I wish is that you could have more than one user or profile on 1 app. I have to use an iPhone and an iPod to have individual profiles for each of my kids.

----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been using the app for over a year and haven’t had any major issues with it. It’s stable and helpful. I do wish it provided more analytical data capability, but it is good for tracking carbs it even recognizes food when you take a picture. It has recognized every barcoded item I’ve tried and lets you reuse items you’ve already scanned and even input your own recipes. It can always use more enhancements like the data analyzing capability I mentioned and a better recipe building capability and salad or sandwich building capability.

This app is excellent for all types of diabetics. It has an exceptional system for documenting meals, meds taken, and blood glucose levels. I am NOT tech savvy and I have been able to easily navigate this app. Within 3 days of using it I upgraded- it was worth every cent. There is even an A1C “predictor” as to what u might expect on your bloodwork.... I will have to come back in 2 months to let you know how close it was! Easy bar code scanning feature to document foods. Easy to document what you eat. A true life & time saver for me.

We recently went back to injections after being on a pump for 7 years. I had forgotten how much info there is to keep track of when you’re doing it without technology! We tried a different app and hated it. Love this one because of the reports, they help me see trends without having to use a CGM, that I can add all her different meds and track her glucose, carb intake, activity and insulin usage. The only thing that could possibly make this better would be if I could enter her ratios for figuring her insulin and correction factor.

Also, I didn't understand the reviewer who said you can't go back and enter older records. Yes you can. I entered months of records, and update my BG numbers every several days.

Over the last two years, I have been using the FreeStyle LibraLink sensor to check my blood sugar. I knew my blood sugar was out of control but did not know how to manage it.

Other benefits are  that I have lost weight and my meds have been reduced. ..all from using Glucose Buddy.  Overall, I feel so much better.  Using this program is easy.   It is life changing.

My son was recently diagnosed with type one diabetes, and this app has made our life much easier.

This is especially helpful when dealing with transitions from one caregiver to another. The ability to print reports for doctors and send them electronically as well is also a huge asset. I highly recommend this app. It is the best one I found.

----------------------------------------------------------
Downloaded this app a few minutes ago and am already very impressed. Easy to input numbers and easy to view.  would say that the first thing I noticed was the scroll wheel. obviously I'm a fan, after all, if Apple does it, then it's all right in my book. Another thing I saw was the option to send feedback directly through the program. Keeping as much as possible in the program (as opposed to having to open my own email client) is very beneficial for me so if I have any questions I can just type away.

I have never written a review before for an app.   I held out on paying for the upgraded price because $ you know, but it got a bit hard using multiple free apps to track health things. I tried several extensively and while others may look more fun, this app does what I need it to do.   It’s very easy using the app to track the things I need.    If I want to track more things it has the capability.   I can track less if I want.   I don’t like having to track but this app makes it easier.

I really like this app. I loved the old insights and when it was updated I was mad. Couldn't stand the new insights. So they put the old one back because I’m guessing many others breathed fire and brimstone on the development team. Well now after reverting, I think I preferred the new interface! Maybe adding the older charting to the new interface as an extra would resolve many issues. I wonder how many people actually experienced this change. Anyway. Thumbs up to the development team.

I beleive this whole process took less than a week. This developer, Tom, not only has the best diabetic program I've found on the App. store...he really cares about how his program fits your needs.

Title: Great app and great support!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using Glucose Buddy since March and have been impressed with how easy it is to use. Today I upgraded to Version 2.0, a much more robust program with a neat web interface, and was completely blown away by the tech support I received. The problem I encountered with the upgrade was not with the program but rather with the weird format my doctor uses for his email. I received immediate replies from my inquiries to Glucose Buddy tech support until my problem got resolved.

----------------------------------------------------------
I had the old product and it was easy to log items, but this new product is above and beyond what I ever expected from this application. I can read results from my iPhone and sync with their system so I can check it any where. The comparison between this version and the previous one is unbelievable. If you need a tool to help track, this is the only one you will need. Only thing i wish they'd add is the opportunity to add A1c values when they are tested. Go for this one.

----------------------------------------------------------
I've been a diabetic for 2 years now and  I never even checked my glucose until my son was born this past November. I realized that I needed to start taking care of myself. This app has certainly helped me gain better control of my glucose and time my metformin doses around my highest and lowest glucose times. It's super easy to use! You can make notes , change times and dates, track weight, and view a linear graph showing your progress. TOTALLY WORTH THE DOWNLOAD!!!!

Title: Sometimes you find a gem
----------------------------------------------------------
This really does feel like a buddy. The care and thought that went into making this app speaks of the developer's desire to fill a gap with a product that exceeds what one would come to expect to find in the App Store. When I say that, what I mean is that we've all went looking for a particular app with the hopes that we /might/ be able to find something remotely useful and settled for mediocrity. I didn't find mediocrity... I found a buddy. (How sappy was that, eh?)

----------------------------------------------------------
Glucose Buddy is just the kind of iPhone-based diabetes log I was looking for. I have tried Islet and Diabetes Log; Glucose Buddy is much better. I like being able to do custom notes to all entries. My life is not routine, so it's nice to catch the nuances of each situation in my notes. Syncing iPhone entries with my online account is awesome. People typically don't just use their iPhone or pc.. The added flexibility of reviewing and editing on both devices is key.

----------------------------------------------------------
What better way to see how you are doing EVERY DAY! I have been faithfully entering my levels every day for the past 9 months. Every so often I "read the graphs" and it really helps me to keep on track. I can tell when I am anxious, or sick and can leave notes to myself to describe where I am. I show my doctor as well. With medication, my levels fall into the pre-diabetes range and I keep to PORTION CONTROL as well. My A1C is at 5.9. That's great. Love this app!!!

I'm a fourth year student at OSU and this app is great. I can sync all my info between my iPad and my phone which is extremely useful. It also let's me log everything from food to glucose to exercise. The partnering with the calorie counter also has helped me lose weight. Sometimes the calorie counter can crash but just open it again and its fine. I love that everything is pushed online and my doctor can see everything I do. Can very finely tune my pump settings.

this software is an answer to prayer for a parent of a 8 yr old type 1 diabetic. the ability to sync up allows his mother to keep it up to date when he is with her. no need to hand over paper logs etc. I truly believe this was written by a diabetic as there were no stones left unturned here. everything was thought of. I admit that I downloaded it because it was free, but all the upgrades for in app purchases were worth every penny. I highly recommend this app!

This app keeps it organized-all in one app. I joined as support to cheer him on and can see his progress as a friend. I highly recommend. Great motivational tool.

If you don't think this helps to keep you on track try not logging BS and food for a week and see.  Just saying as I did and wow not a pretty picture.  Couple this with " Lose it " and you will have a perfect marriage.  Please keep up the food work.

----------------------------------------------------------
I developed gestational diabetes and this app has been fantastic for keeping a log of my daily readings. Plus I can email the log to my doctors. I use it along with Daily Carb - that app has been good for looking up carb values of food. It'd be great if a feature like that could be incorporated into this app.  And it'd be even better if I could plug in an amount of carbs (say 15g) and a food (say quinoa) and have it tell me how much I could eat.

I found that working actively with Glucose Buddy I was able to monitor, control and reduce my A1C significantly. I made good use of the average (under Profile) glucose logs and converting them to a probable A1C (through online Accu Check A1C Calculator) giving me incentive and hope. Glucose Buddy provided printouts of logs for my Internist, and Graphs illustrated my strengths and weaknesses, and eating patterns to share as well. Wonderful Tool!

Update: 20 Sept. 2014. I have changed my rating from a one to a four as they seem to have finally fixed the issue where the data synching would fail for weeks at a time. For about the past two weeks I have had zero problems with the app. The reason I did not give them a five is that they never answer support requests. They need to understand they are in a customer service field of business, not just an app development business.

I had to reinstall programs on my iPhone and tried to access the web, had some problems, but customer support had the answer almost immediately.

It keeps me in line better when I not only have to test my blood sugar, but then I have to enter it into glucose buddy – – makes it more realistic than just looking at the number on my meter and turning it off.  I highly recommend getting this app.

Excellent app to track blood glucose and medications.  Syncs to my iMac & iPad flawlessly.  Don't waste your money on the Calorie Tracker option... It's not ready for "prime time"... Crashes and needs too much input if you want to track your typical foods.  But, Glucose Buddy without Calorie Tracker is very useful and works without any problems.  Makes no sense to keep a paper log anymore!

No substitute for real lab testing but a great way to verify you are on track with your efforts.

It is great to see the graph and averages too. I don't know how the paid version could be any better than the free version. Thank you for an app that actually makes my life easier!

Title: Almost perfect
----------------------------------------------------------
Just to preface this - I have had type II diabetes for 20 years.  For the past four years I have been on insulin to control my diabetes.  I have also been running a Palm application to keep a log of my blood sugars and, carb intake, insulin use, etc.  Given the age of the Palm, an iPod touch seemed to be a good choice to replace it.

Title: Why pay when the best app is free!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is by far my most used app. I can keep track of everything for my gestational diabetes and sync it to their website. The support is awesome, they are very responsive to all my emails. I paid for another diabetes app and ended up deleting it because this one has everything I needed and did it better. Keep up the great work!!

Title: A fabulous tool!
----------------------------------------------------------
Granted I'm hoping I only really have to keep up with this until the birth of my 2nd child, but this has been a lifesaver app. Really user friendly with an online backup that is easy enough to share with doctors. The partner app (calorie tracker) doesn't work and the food log has room for improvement, but otherwise a fantastic tool!

Title: Glucose Buddy gets it right!
----------------------------------------------------------
Recently diagnosed Type2. After doing extensive research to find the perfect  App to help me "stay on top" of my blood glucose numbers I find Glucose Buddy the best! Informative, easy, and innovative. Can't wait to see what they come up with in the way of 'add-ond'. Would most definately recommend GB! It works for my busy lifestyle.

Title: How do you do it free?
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a short update. I'm changing to 5 stars. The graph has been added again. It got to be a hobby to find the best app. I bought and tried a couple more. This free app is the best of any. Very professional. The only thing I would like to see changed is an ability to make changes in data submitted mistakenly. Small problem, huh?

Title: Reliable
----------------------------------------------------------
Glucose buddy helps me keep track of my blood sugar and meals. It makes it easier for my doctor to review daily readings. So far I think this is a wonderful app for anyone who is diabetic and forget to write their numbers down. Now all they need to do is push some buttons and save and they have an accurate record. Great, great app.

Title: Great App for Diabetics
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has been great for helping to track my glucose levels along with my weight, blood pressure and other important health numbers. It's great because I no longer have to worry if I forget to take my glucose logs to the Doctor it's all on my phone, and I can also sync it to my computer. Good job in this and it's user friendly.

Title: Wonderful app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I really like this app.  Great for tracking and letting my doctor see the data and the graphs.  Love that I can sync it and keep the data for comparison purposes.  Thanks for a versitle and valuable tool!  I was using it on my iPod Touch and now use it on my iPad.  Wish there were some way to load the old data to my iPad though.

Title: Really handy!
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a great app for tracking glucose. I was able to enter old readings manually with no problem. It sorts corrections and keeps things in date order really well. I'm eager for an iPad version or at least for the iPhone version to support rotating but that's not a big deal. Bottom line it's a great app across many platforms.

Title: Great App!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been a type 1 diabetic for a loooong time. I was diagnosed before testing strips existed. This app is pretty amazing and keeps all of my info in one spot. I have always had a bunch of the little log books lying around and this makes things much easier. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to manage their diabetes.

Title: Works Great for What I do Use of It!
----------------------------------------------------------
I really didn't use the calorie burning portion because I use another system through my gym that has its own tracking system. I've never had a single problem using it to track and record my sugar levels. My sister is a nurse and loves that it downloads and emails accurately and correctly in an easy to read format for doctors.

Title: This tool is great
----------------------------------------------------------
TRY THIS APP FIRST! After using this tool for a week I must say it's more than I expected. Data entry is easy and log displays are clean. I had a sync problem but email support was quick and successful. I would like to see a category for blood pressure added in a future version. This version seem to run fine on iPhone OS 3.0.

Title: Thank You
----------------------------------------------------------
For those who are new to Diabetes they have yet to find the biggest problem, getting back on the wagon when you fall off! Logging (through a windows app) all the time kept me going when I first encountered this monster, my BG, food and weight, but when I went on vacation and this wasn't possible it was hard to keep it going!

Title: The Best !!!
----------------------------------------------------------
A complete glucose/medication/carb and exercise app with GREAT features. I love being able to add notes to each entry. My diabetic team loves the email feature. Although don't bother with calorie track, GoMeals is so much easier to use and has a much better database. When will GB be able to sync with the new Fitness Buddy!?!

Title: Excelente programa
----------------------------------------------------------
Sin duda alguna este programa nos ayuda a mantener un archivo de nuestro control de diabetes y mas aun cuando nos calcula el promedio diario del mismo. La diversidad del mismo en archivar otros parametros de salud como lo es la presion, el peso corporal y otros lo hacen uno induscutiblemente bueno. Lo recomiendo! Muy bueno.
