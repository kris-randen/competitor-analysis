Title: Amazing app!
----------------------------------------------------------
My name is Dhruv and I was a bit fat a few weeks ago but then I came across this app. I started of with the beginners sessions and finished it so that I could go for belly burn. What I found out was I had already burned a lot of calories just with the beginners package. But I did not stop there as I knew that if I had stopped, then my fat would have kept on increasing. So I went for the belly burn. The first package of the belly burn which was the beginners one started out great. The instructor explained all the steps in detail and I got the hang of by the end of the sessions. Then when I started the first session of intermediate, I realised that all the calmness the instructor had in the beginners package took a huge dip. But that was fine as I did understand everything the instructor had explained. Then when I dot to advanced, I realised that this was not easy and that the beginners training would take me up for something like that. But I was impressed as by the end of the whole belly burn package, I had lost over 5 kg.p and I was very happy. So I would easily recommend this app to anyone looking to get exercise, yoga, dance and much more. Thank you for all the support!

Title: Best workout experience ever.
----------------------------------------------------------
I have worked out is several gyms for the last 10 years and I must say this is the best so far. In terms of everything from start to finish. If you have a busy schedule and don‚Äôt know what time you can get to gym this is the best as you can choose the time accordingly. Also, you just have to show up to class and they make sure they understand your intensity and suggest easier or tougher variation based on your endurance. The different variations is what gets you hooked. If your idea is to go regularly then try out all the classes and pick and choose what you like. It‚Äôs been 3 months and apart from Sunday‚Äôs I go every other day. The app and software part of cult is amazing, as a software engineer I can totally tell they have done an amazing job. They have the outdoors and swimming pools which are a good addition. You won‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs monotonous at all. Try the yoga classes as well. They are super good and relaxing after a great workout. Kudos to cult.

Title: Just brilliant !
----------------------------------------------------------
I am amazed to see the professionalism ingrained from entrance to the exit ... it‚Äôs just mind blowing ; the way eat , plan , fit is put together  ... all is well thought of ... never imagined there will be so minute detailing done on keeping water area too :) just great ... I attended one session and booked and have told 3 people within 12 hours .. I wish the quality is maintained and people are smiling as they are now ; being in‚Äôs hospitality it‚Äôs important to keep fit and energetic people to meet the athletes ( as you call us ) ;).... I lost trust in the good gyms because they hardly maintain quality forever ... also the intelligence is seen when you have opened so many Centers... that‚Äôs really cutting the deal as I always wanted this kind of place but either it was far off from my place or blowing me off .... :) well done ! And it‚Äôs not easy to get complements from new athletes like us ;)

Loving it.. I have improved a lot. I have to  built my energy more. I have to  improve more day by day. I have to get better. Thankyou so much cultfit for live classes.

Title: It brings discipline in life
----------------------------------------------------------
I dont agree with review done by miss damani. I believe. Its good to be disciplined in life. And being on time is first thing. I am not at all a gym person. Too lazy for Work outs and walks. But i joined cult three months back as a trial and i am addicted to it already.  My initial mission was to loose weight but now its just pure happiness. I feel happy through out the day when i spend an hour in the morning working out at cult. Trust me there r no tantrics doing jadu tona to hypnotize u there. They r just hard working trainers who spend their entire day to give u sessions at ur chosen time. I already extended my membership and love working out there. Have a lot to say but will conclude

Title: Best Application Ever!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve seen many applications related to workout,meditation and yoga. But this is completely different. Care,Cult,eat,mind...OMG! This‚Äôs really a multi useful app. Before installing this app I used to be very sleepy,exhausted,lazy but after, my schedule is totally changed. I decided to start workout at home though there‚Äôs no cult center in my place. First I started session for beginners. I was quite excited to do them by seeing the videos. Those videos are absolutely fantastic...the way you elucidate and timing perfection and encouragement brings up a new interest. During my beginning stage, I felt some pain and soreness in my muscles...but I didn‚Äôt give up since NO PAIN NO GAIN!

Title: Cure.Fit tech team - you guys are rock stars!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love the experience on the app and this has also resulted in a positive experience during all my offline interactions at the care fit clinics or eat.fit outlets. It doesn‚Äôt take a lot of time to notice why offline experiences has been phenomenal as the technology for both sides (Cure.fit teams and customers) has been exceptional. Personally, I have not seen this level of tech enablement in the healthcare or hospitality in such a short span of time. Thanks for enabling the video consultations with doctors/nutritionists  and Live.Fit classes. The app experience has become 10x more enriching since the lockdown in March 2020 and the MasterClasses are fantastic too!

Title: Worst customer support
----------------------------------------------------------
Since my stay was for a short while in India I wrote an email asking for one month packages. After patiently waiting for 24 hours I got a reply stating there are one month packs available in the app for your location. I eagerly went and checked immediately and saw nothing but the 6 months and 3 months available. I again wrote to them stating I don‚Äôt see it. After again waiting for 1 day the reply they send me is to reinstall the app from App Store. Which I had already done and sent them a screenshot as well. The next time when I still do not see any one month packages I sent them an email and this time no body even cared to reply to my email.

Title: Untrustworthy App
----------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to opt for 1 year pack that‚Äôs why I have paid 23k for 1 year unlimited pack using this app(customer can only opt/pay for membership using this bogus app)one week back.My money got debited from my bank account and I got message from bank also, but it was not reflecting in app.Immediately I wrote a mail to cure.fit and also visited cure.fit Prabhadevi branch but seems like this people don‚Äôt bother about it.I didn‚Äôt received any call from customer support yet.This is such a unprofessional behaviour.And worst part is you will not find out any customer support phone number anywhere on web or not even in there app.

Title: CureFit is an absolute fire!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been very whimsical about workouts. Even though I hail from a family with sports background but then too I am not someone who would dedicatedly continue the workouts. CureFit has help me achieve what I have been trying to achieve since a very long time..Motivation. With the variety of workouts, yoga, kickboxing etc. that they have in service is something you do not come across everywhere. The intensity of the exercises and the duration is perfect. The availability of classes at the tip of your fingers in Live classes, is something which is praiseworthy.

Title: The Cult
----------------------------------------------------------
I joined cult in November 2019 for the variety of workout that was available. I enjoyed the format of workout to choose from, the professionalism displayed by each athlete during the sessions, and the 50 min workout regime that‚Äôs designed to perfection. Things went on as usual and then comes the lockdown due to covid-19, cult takes the country by surprise by releasing a live session workout, and it‚Äôs open to non-members too. To me Cult is a classic example of how a start-up should operate, it‚Äôs a management case study for sure..!

----------------------------------------------------------
cure.fit has great offerings. I would guess the fitness regimes are very close to what professional athletes have. sports, strength conditioning, boxing, yoga, swimming, dancing, meditation, they‚Äôve got pretty much everything covered. I‚Äôve tried cult, eat fit and mind fit and my experience have been very satisfying. the trainers are highly professional and the classes are conducted in a structured format. the group classes are fun and we end up doing a lot more than we would otherwise. I highly recommend cult üëç

----------------------------------------------------------
I am usually not a work out person, but a close friend who‚Äôs husband works with cult fitness in Hyderabad suggested their workout sessions. And normally the first day tires you so much specially so when you work out after long that you don‚Äôt have the motivation to continue. But cure.fit isn‚Äôt like that. They have very gradual levels of workouts. Like I started with the basic one the beginners workout. I am absolutely loving it. On top of that the lady is very engaging. Love the way she motivates you.

----------------------------------------------------------
Seriously guys this is my third bad review in a row about dance fitness classes on both class review and app review. What is wrong with you guys, dance fitness used to be great, these days they are absolutely worst. You guys are literally destroying the original energy of the songs with your absolutely worst moves which doesn‚Äôt affect the body at all. Please improve your dance moves and select energetic songs with right moves. No stars for online dance fitness classes. Absolutely worst!

It is one stop shop for everything related to fitness and nutrition, starting right from dance classes, yoga, meditation, exercises keeping in mind specific area or part of the body, strength and endurance etc. to nutrition, healthy food recipes and what not! The instructors are super motivating! You could choose between live classes or recorded sessions as per convenience. Undoubtedly the best app for health!

Hi, being a cult member since a long time. I am also a mobile application QA for IOS Apps in IBM. I am really amazed by the way this app really works.

----------------------------------------------------------
Started following cure.fit for home workouts during the pandemic and I‚Äôm surprisingly contented. I always believed home workouts are not worth it or difficult to follow regularly, but cure.fit has totally busted this belief of mine. The trainers, the exercises, the intensity of the workouts are absolutely fantastic. I‚Äôm even thinking of quitting the weight training by going to gym altogether and continuing with body weight training at home forever (Naah, I‚Äôm just joking lol).

It is the right solution needed for the hour and to pull out the interested cult people out of sedentary  lifestyle & comfort zone to active zone. Getting the fitness goal kicked off, tracked through an app is much needed in current lifestyle chaos and  this app is doing it at its best. Right from registration, it was a pleasant experience. As mentioned in title, if you are committed to this app, this will make you sedentary to swiftly. Happy Cult üòä

----------------------------------------------------------
Cult workouts are very disciplined . This is real good as we put in the right amount of energy and stamina to complete our exercise routine . We are left motivated and energised for the whole day. It is a one stop where every fitness enthusiast must go and experience the goodness and fun of workouts.

----------------------------------------------------------
I simply love cure.fit services and follow their guidelines to inherit a healthy lifestyle. I felt it should part of health plan, where we pay large premium for health insurance. Instead of paying large amount there people should pay here. There would be more chances to fit all time and less decease

On my ipad pro (2017 i think) when I start a live workout I am not able to change the screen rotation to all sides. I use a keyboard attachment which also acts as sort of a stand, so except that screen rotation angle the screen rotates to all other angles when I tilt my ipad.

The app is very well designed. It makes it easier to book and manage classesintended . The only glitch is that it shows centers that are not functional on the app. Once the class is booked, one has to go to a nearby center. Apart from this glitch, it's a great app.
