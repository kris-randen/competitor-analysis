Title: Not smiling
----------------------------------------------------------
Just started to make this new version work, reloaded all my recipes, figured out the charts, thinking okay maybe I can handle this. I am praying you stop updating and...just fix the messes!!! Now I can't get off the home page to use ANY part of this app. It froze up and the little wheel in the middle just keeps spinning!!!! Please make this torture stop!! You have no idea how much I have depended on this app for a long time to help control my diabetes..fix it....different day new problem-now logging food I ate has changed and it won't log fractions-only whole numbers. That whole setup has a new and difficult application. How come every day I find something changed?? STOP SCREWING THIS UP FOR ME !!! No way would I waste money on upgrading..I need an answer..what am I supposed to do ?? It is a new day, and I hung in there to see if kinks were fixed. So far, it seems to do what it should. Hoping nothing changes in the morning🤞. Thanks for responding... 8/25/17...>you just updated this app, and now it is screwed up again..not surprised !!! I have nothing but a blank white screen. Why can you not just leave it alone. It was working fine, and now I have nothing!!!!!!  Here is my review update:: you are too freaking late-I deleted it this morning because it was still crashed !!! Nothing zero dead app and I had so much stuff in there I cannot even believe it. I will not reload that app ever again because you will screw it up with another update😡🖕..................11/15/17..just paid for premium-and you erased everything in my history. All my favorites and recipes, EVERYTHING!!! please put it back or refund my money. I wanted to give this app a chance because it is useful, but not if I have to keep starting all over again !!! Help me please.........now it is 11/17/17, and I don’t think you can help me now. I reloaded this app AGAIN with all my info, and I canceled the auto-renewal of my upgrade. I prefer to use the free version. And not go through this again. I have diabetes, so managing all of this is very helpful to me...fav foods, recipes, weight control, and I don’t want to have to reload all this a third time, or waste anymore money...I will not pay for anymore premium. But gee, thanks for responding..............5/23/18 Latest update—have tried to create an account to preserve my data, but this app will not accept my info. It says this email address has already been taken—YES—BY ME! I am trying to use my own email and password, and this app won’t accept what everyone else on the planet will. Can you tell me why. Have asked for help once, and got nothing

Title: Not registering intake?
----------------------------------------------------------
I just entered my “breakfast“ on another popular app, and it told me that 1 teaspoon of braggs apple cider vinegar and 2 teaspoons of Metamucil sugar-free registers as 40 caliries and 10g carbs.  I enter the same two items on this app, and it registers 0 calories and 0 carbs of any kind, total or net or anything. What am I supposed to make of this?  Does this app realize I ate at least something, and that this something does have at least calories, or not?? Also very difficult to navigate this app, as just trying to select how many teaspoons of something results in having to fudge with selecting the actual number of teaspoons and then the teaspoon/tablespoon selection itself, but there’s always this weird looking half bent number on the wheels above where are you need to line up those selections just so, so it appears that after you make all your selections, there is always something above and below it, and I don’t think there should be anything above it, zero. It’s very confusing. Additionally, it took me 15 minutes to figure out what to do after I got those numbers lined up… Eventually I wound up tapping where there is a checkmark in the green bar and that seem to make the selections “take“ And register in the daily food consumption list. It really should say something like enter or add or something, because it took me so long to figure this out.  I’m not a fan of this interface.

Title: Upgraded version of app has become unusable
----------------------------------------------------------
Have used the app for years, spending hours over time adding custom foods, nutritional info, etc. Upgraded to the new app, and when prompted for a login, the screen said existing data would be transferred over to new app. It wasn’t. Original requests for help finally got a reply of “just start using the new version and we’ll see what we can do. New requests for help with still-not transferred data have not been answered. I started trying to re-add foods, and really appreciate the barcode scan feature, which should save heaps of time entering info. Except some of it doesn’t match at all what’s listed on the nutrition info panel on the package. Multiple efforts to update info let me edit values, but then doesn’t save them, so only records in the daily log the wrong info/values. Totally frustrating waste of time. New version is not at all intuitive as previous version was. Am giving up on this app, as I can no longer use it to accurately capture macro nutrient counts or edit incorrect info or regain any of the info or progress data  I had previously entered over 4+ years. It’s a great idea and served me very well for a few years, but new version needs some improvement for accuracy, usability, and support.

Title: Clunky and useless
----------------------------------------------------------
Hate this worse all the time to the point I no  longer use it.  Can’t turn off the stupid auto generated newsfeed so you have to constantly delete things you wish to keep private. Can’t find a way to see what privacy they are giving away in their auto generated profile and there appears to be no way to edit it for personal privacy. Hate the in your face advertising to buy their cookbook from Amazon, I don’t use Amazon, EVER. Absolutely can’t stand the trashy cluttered homepage. Worse it’s blaring white is obnoxious. Can’t control or edit your own dashboard to avoid trashy clutter. Since update it’s just miserable to log food, scan barcodes, create personal recipes. (Which instantly pop up on stupid newsfeed without your consent) Years of waiting for them to put life Essence vitamin tablets in library, endless requests ignored. Library of foods has been reduced so many items can no longer be scanned. NONSTOP GLITCHES AND CRASHES EVERYWHERE IN APP. It’s really bad sensory overload and or mystery puzzle to even do simple things or simple intuitive data entry. Old version was far superior. NO LONGER WORTH PAYING FOR UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.

Title: Useless. Missing lots of natural foods.
----------------------------------------------------------
After reading the reviews for the old version, I was hoping the new version would be better so I bought it. What a waste of money. If you are already on a whole food diet, don't expect to find many food items here. Lots of natural cheeses are missing, there isn't a red potato or other variety other than white unless it's a deep fried chip. Milk is limited, couldn't find coconut milk or almond milk or any other alternates either, but they do have every kind of processed cow and infant formula. You can find almost any processed or fast food on here. In order to find the few raw items, you have to scroll through HUNDREDS of processed food items. There are lots of greens added, however. I would like to see more menus with unprocessed, non-packaged food items separated from the rest. I've just spent a  little more than a hour sorting through it, and only found about a dozen foods to add to my favorites. This is useless as it doesn't have lots of the food I eat. You are better off researching your food items on the internet and tracking the carbs in a notebook.

Title: Lots of bugs and not user friendly
----------------------------------------------------------
There’s a decent amount of good reviews for this app so I decided to pay for a year of premium despite there being no free trial days. That was a big mistake on my part. This app is not user friendly and takes quite a while to figure out how to properly navigate. The feature that allows you to create a meal plan constantly bugs out before I hit save. I started a meal plan on a day just to test it out and see how it works. Then I updated the meal plan and hit start again. It ended up adding to the previous meal plan instead of updating it. I tried looking for ways to cancel the previous plan or delete meals individually but couldn’t figure it out. The shopping list feature also has bugs. I had a snack listed for my meal plans but later deleted the snacks and hit save. It still gets listed on the shopping list so I went back to check my meal plan and it’s not even listed on there anymore. I don’t recommend paying for premium. I definitely won’t be using it anymore and am waiting to hear back about a refund.

Hi sasalala751 - Thanks for letting us know about the issues. Those are definitely not typical for the app, and we'd love the opportunity to provide personal assistance and get this sorted out for you. If you haven't already, please reach out to our friendly support team in the app via Settings → Help & Support, and be sure to include your app store username for fastest service.

Title: New Update Ruined a Perfect App
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been a Carb Manager subscriber for years. It’s the perfect way to track my carb/calorie intake each time I need to lose a little weight. Or it was.. this new update has completely ruined the app (mid-diet, btw). I lost almost all my saved recipes. Nutrition data is inaccurate ~50% of the time now, particularly when you choose to weigh things out in ounces (which I do for everything). I have to stop what I’m doing to report each case of inaccurate data, which is impossible when I’m in the middle of cooking and trying to rebuild a recipe I used to have saved. Plus, the interface is oversized. One logged day used to fit almost all one one screen (without scrolling), but now theres so much extra data built in, I have to scroll three times as far. It was clearly not redesigned with a regular size iPhone screen in mind. It really is a shame, I will be cancelling my subscription and will be on the search for another app that is closer to the original version of this one.

Title: Wha? Why?
----------------------------------------------------------
Yeeeah, if you could back in time and not do that one thing....  CM, for you it would be the update.  The layout is flashy but confusing. The food logs are off and don’t calculate the net carbs correctly. The iWatch no longer logs burned calories and macro adjustments. (Reached out to support and received crickets in reply) I’m disappointed to say the least. My SO is also completely underwhelmed with the app update. The original format worked wonders for our health.  Now I am basically using the app as a food log. Sadness overwhelms me. At least it was only a 3 month subscription purchase when it was on sale. (Thusly canceling) There should be a stress level section so I can input it going up every time I log onto the app.  PS I love all the Devs putting up 5 star reviews trying to save the sinking ship.  If you’re using supportive formal robotic language in your description of the features of the app... You’re faking it.

Title: Really inaccurate
----------------------------------------------------------
I would never consider upgrading to a paid version as trust me, having this over a year, you wouldn’t believe HOW MANY products are listed with inaccurate nutrition- carbs especially for them. That’s the main purpose of the app! To count carbs for Keto/low carb life stylers! I literally just scanned another one today that was wayyy off… usually fiber or sugar alcohols aren’t subtracted. Very inconsistent. For some I’ll just find a product that’s similar and put that as the food I ate rather than wasting so much time trying to update products, etc. which I have done before. The app is cumbersome to use, slow to find exercises, I don’t know I just don’t care for it failing at what may be its main purpose… to count carbs!! I held off reviewing until I just had yet another product that was wrong. Where’s the quality review team? Focus on quality to get people interested in spending money for your product!

Hi & thanks! We work hard on the accuracy of our Food DB. It's true some branded/processed foods have been input by users, so if there are inaccuracies, you can always Report a Food Error or make Quick Edits to them. Just reach out in-app, & we can help share how as well as how to identify our NCCDB verified foods to make it easier for logging!

Title: Time to drop this app...
----------------------------------------------------------
I'll go back to pencil and paper before I will struggle with this another hour. Was concerned as I watched it auto update this morning. Tried it and was very disappointed. Why does everything need rings just because Apple Watch has it??? I got rid of the rings and got a completely meaningless pie chart as I had only entered 1 item for the day. Tried editing my last item from last night as planned and it was a nightmare. The simple wheel of portions and measurement are gone. I hate tapping +++ vs ---.  The user interface is blurry. I actually saw 1-1/2 in font that was barely readable. Additional analysis charts  are there but I am not 'anal' and they are hard to read. Plus you do not know my goals and my goals are none of your business. But as I played with them, it is not easy,  not intuitive, and presumes too much on the part of the app. All I want is a count of carb, fat and protein. Period.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi Al, we appreciate your input and hope you will consider giving the new version another chance. We've increased font sizes, and fixed a few bugs. For the food picker, you can now use the + and - buttons to change the value, or just tap on the field and enter a value with the keypad. Try it out for a while and let us know where we can improve. We really do listen to feedback and make changes based on what users want.

Title: New Update Is Awful
----------------------------------------------------------
Carb Manager just completely updated their app (without giving notice to users...which is really harsh). The new “updated” app is cumbersome and takes a long time to open. It is very difficult to navigate and and saved foods/recipes are not organized in any helpful way. Also the visuals of daily progress of goals is now circles...which makes no sense.  How do you indicate on a circle if you go over your carb/fat/calorie goal...well you can’t is the answer..(this really makes no sense and was clearly designed by people who don’t actually use or understand the app). There is also no visual way to measure your actual daily progress against your goals....again the circles are worthless. The “old” interface was easy and intuitive. I wish the new update made sense but it’s like replacing an Audi with a golf cart and saying it drives better. The new updated app a big No thanks

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there! We are so grateful for your long time support. First, rest assured that our developers are working quickly to tune the new version of the app. We also understand that many users have grown very familiar with the former app version and that the update is a big adjustment.

Title: Not as good as ratings
----------------------------------------------------------
Having used other apps like this before, I wanted to try something new at the suggestion of a friend. I upgraded to the premium version to access meal plans and recipes. First problem I had is if you tap to generate a plan you have to wait because there is delay. Didn’t realize this because I tapped again and it brought me all the way to the beginning and I lost the customized plan that took me 40minutes to build after going through looking at all the recipes and such. Then I lost time again after finally getting a plan to finding where it is. It doesn’t really give you the portions or tell you how much you should be consuming based on the macros in the plan. Overall disappointed I paid for 3 months and I won’t be using this crap! No trial period so you are just hosed! Good idea but bad mobile rollout in my opinion. Wouldn’t recommend!

Hi there, and thanks for leaving us constructive feedback! The issue you are having is definitely not normal app behavior. Please allow us the opportunity to look into this further by messaging us from within the app or emailing us at support@carbmanager.com.

Title: Don't pay the 19.99.
----------------------------------------------------------
So the free version was ok but it said in order to sync with my jawbone and Fitbit I needed to pay the subscription fee.  I was looking for one place to integrate all the information I use daily for my health so I bought it.  And then I get the instruction that I have to use the Apple health app basically to go between and in order to do this I had to BUY two more apps to allow this sync.  It tells you one of them is free, but it isn't.  So I decided to try it.  If it worked it would be worth it.  There is zero difference in what I was getting for FREE!  I still have to go to the health app to get any information.  And my free food tracking app is actually putting all the same info there.  I have written and asked them to help me figure out what my advantage in paying is.  No response.  Honestly.  I want my money back. This is a waste.

Title: Premium is awful
----------------------------------------------------------
Don’t buy the premium plan. I have been trying for months to get a meal plan generate and populate my calendar and shopping list and haven’t been able to get this to work since I purchased it last April. Don’t waste your money it will just frustrate you and you will never get your money back. I saw my meal plans one day and then they vanished and the meal plan still had foods in it I can’t eat. I don’t normally write reviews but I have to stop others from wasting their money. I’ve tried since the first week to cancel and get my money back but there was no option. Horrible. Update I just now received a response from their customer support which as you can see is long after this review. And of no help now that my subscription expired. I got no use from the app and paid for nothing. Very poor customer service

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for contacting us! Please note that after you apply a meal plan, you need to individually log items (tap the three dots next to the food in your Daily Log, then select Log Item). To exclude foods, please be sure to select all variations of a food under the Exclude Ingredients selector, or use the Food Aversions field. If you're still unhappy with Premium, please contact us at support@wombatapps.com and we'll assist. Thanks!

Title: Upgraded app is not as awesome as the original
----------------------------------------------------------
When I first bought this app I felt like it was worth every penny I spent for the full features...but since the upgrade you have to weigh every bit of food you want to record...that is not how I cook I measure with cups now it won’t let you measure that way...I am not going to rewrite every recipe I get to try to figure out what the weight is...now it is useless to me...skip this app unless you want to add the extra step of weighing all your food then converting it back to cups for recipes you make!!! Ok after working with the new app again I see the problem...in the old app you could set the serving size to what you were actually eating in the new app I cant do that ...even after support told me where to locate the “setting” it doesn’t work...PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD VERSION IT WAS AWESOME THIS IS NOT!!!

Title: Not user friendly at all !
----------------------------------------------------------
I’m so sorry I signed up for the premium, as it looked like many useful extras, but boy was I wrong. Most of the premium features are not compatible with my device...I have the newest I phone. To look up basic recipes is a joke, the internet feature shows no items, when clearly when I get on the internet I find tons of the same recipes I search in the app. Can not figure out how to add measurements, although that looks to be a feature. I literally have to google recipes and manually add in the ingredients. Even a basic recipe just shows variations of the food that is nothing like I’m trying to add. If I could give this 0 stars I would, wish I had tried the one month plan first. I’ll stick with the FREE My fitness pal, does so much more and so easy and user friendly. 👎👎👎

Title: 2021 update is terrible
----------------------------------------------------------
Used to love this app, where I pay for premium version, but changes for 2021 make it less usable. New version is aesthetically nice, but navigation is cumbersome and requires a lot of scrolling and swiping to get the screen you want. Since updating in Feb, the app reads data from Apple Health but no longer writes data, thereby wrecking my use of not just one app but two! I’ve tried troubleshooting tips and they don’t work. In theory the Graphing button in carb manager would allow me to see progress over time (weekly, monthly, etc), but the circles for each data point make the graphs unreadable. I’d prefer the summary column graphs that Apple Health displays — but I can no longer use AH to see nutrition data because CM doesn’t write data! Please fix these issues!!!

Developer Response:

Title: So much potential—just won’t work
----------------------------------------------------------
I am so disappointed with this app. I excitedly paid $29 for the year subscription, then became so frustrated just trying to get it to launch. I’m tech-saavy with an always up-to-date iPhone, reliable carrier (bill paid!), good signal, solid WiFi. I know a good internet connection. This app consistently spins and spins telling me, “trying to open, please check internet connection” etc. The occasional times it will open, navigating its cluttered user interface is just exasperating. I had such high hopes because the app seemed comprehensive and mirrored my lifestyle desires and intentions. It has so much potential—just won’t work reliably. Apple would not refund my purchase even though I explained my frustrations and having it just few months or so.

Title: Used to be great!
----------------------------------------------------------
The old carb manager was the best app out there for keto before the upgrade. I really liked the feature where you could plan out your meals on the calendar- yes you can make meal plans with the upgrade but it’s not at all user friendly and so hard to do. It was nice to be able to plan my macros exactly for the next week or two in advance because as a full time student and mom to two toddlers, I don’t have time to do Keto on the fly. Please at least give the option of going back to the old version. So many of the items scanned on the barcode that use to show up no longer show up any more. It’s incredibly frustrating. Used to love this app but I am seriously considering finding a different one once by subscription ends in a couple of weeks.

Title: Clearly Disappointed
----------------------------------------------------------
Researched, read the reviews and needing help managing my Type 2 diabetes I decided to download. Graphics are nice and I played with it and decided to buy the Premium so I could sync with my Fitbit which I love. I paid $50 bucks only to find out the data flows one way. From Fitbit to Carb Manager but carb manager doesn’t read the food so you get nothing but calories in gross numbers. I also understood I could log blood sugar readings and insulin. Never found it. To top it off, just now, for the first time in 5 years with Fitbit their app quit logging data input. I cancelled my subscription only to find out it’s cancelled for next year, not a refund for poor performance which I deserve. So Developers... if you read this I want a refund.

The app has logged me off twice, and then will not accept my password which I know is correct because I use facial recognition on my phone. I made at least 20 attempts to reset my password and gave never received the reset email. I’ve tried sending the Wombat Corp and email with no response and I’ve tried the chat with no response. I used another email today to get a new account started and the same thing happened. I have paid for a premium membership and I’m not able to use the site. I don’t want to keep creating new accounts every day. I really enjoyed the app, and would like to be able to use it again, especially since I paid for the premium service. I guess I’ll be contacting The App Store for a refund. Very disappointing

Title: The numbers don’t add up
----------------------------------------------------------
I was super excited to find this app. But over using it for several days, realized the math did not add up. When looking at mayonnaise, I noticed that the numbers for 1/2 cup were NOT double of a quarter cup (and not even remotely close). Then I started to notice that the numbers for the grams of proteins and carbs were not adding up correctly in my daily total. Again, not even close. So its totally useless to do what it claims. You can’t manage your carbs when its a crap shoot if there is ANY accuracy at all. Third thing- I noticed when eating a Kind bar, that was the EXACT same size and flavor as listed in the app, that the carbs, protein and calories were wildly off. I would suggest getting a different app. I am.

Title: Something isn’t right!
----------------------------------------------------------
When I first downloaded the app, certain features were only available for premium members so because I liked the app and wanted to get everything out of it I decided to sign up to become a premium member. They had it advertised as $3 something a month for twelve months so I figured hey $3 and some change a month wouldn’t hurt just to see if I really like the app. So upon clicking on the 12 month subscription and signing up, I receive my receipt from apple stating that they charged me the full years price!!! No where on the app did it say that you pay the full price it said PER MONTH! So I’m really not understanding why they charged me the full amount instead of the per month price. Something just isn’t right!!

Title: Refund refund refund
----------------------------------------------------------
I have a friend that’s lost 65 pounds in about a year told me how great this carb counter program was I’ve always hated to get something online because they turn around and always mess you up with membership fees and when they’re supposed to take them out in the amount of each payment but my friend told me that this App was great and worth the money so I decided to get it I I am disabled and live on a fixed income so I clicked on the option for 333 a month and carb counter turnaround and charged me $39.99was immediately overdrew my account I’ve tried and tried and tried to get in touch with them for a refund to no avail so now it’s cost me $39.99 Plus the $32 overdraft fee where oh where are the real people

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi Michael - Thanks for sharing your feedback. As with any online service, when we show our annual pricing, that means that the amount will be taken out all at once. To make this as clear as possible, we have an FAQ at the bottom of the pricing page titled "When will I be billed?". I'm sorry to hear that you haven't gotten a response back from our support team. You can reach them in the app via Settings → Help & Support. They typically respond within 24 hours. All the best in the meantime!

Title: No longer allows you to create recipes
----------------------------------------------------------
I have loved this app for support through my keto journey for six months now. Yesterday morning I did the update. Last night I made some chicken broth & entered all the ingredients as I usually do. Then I went to create a recipe like I’ve done many times before only to find that in the update, they’ve removed the ability to create a recipe without a premium membership. This is incredibly disappointing. I’ll be looking for another app to record my macros that isn’t going to charge $39.99 a year to create my own recipes. I don’t care about the other premium benefits. Why can’t this feature grandfather into those who were already users or charge something reasonable like $2.99 for the one feature I want?

Title: Perfect before new interface
----------------------------------------------------------
The app was 100% perfect and fast before the new January 21 version with the new interface (have been using it for 10 months now). It now needs literally minutes to start and then it still needs a lot of minutes to get each item in the database - seems the app reloads it entirely each letter you type in the search box! Also the upgrade lost my “recipes” 😢😔😤. Also, the support is not answering whereas it was previously. I do not want to change keto tracking app but also I can’t spend 10+ minutes waiting for an app to respond before being able to track only one item I want to eat... and no roll back seems possible :-( very sad about this not-smart move from Carb manager team 🤔😔😢

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi Smarties - Thanks for reaching out. Luckily, all of those issues can be resolved! Support is available to assist as always. We're seeing high ticket volumes and it may sometimes take longer than in the past. But rest assured, they're still available to assist! You can contact them in the app via Settings → Help & Support.

Title: Want a refund
----------------------------------------------------------
Love Lose It app but was starting Atkins and thought this would be better for counting net carbs. Not really. The calculation for net carbs isn't the same as Atkins. There is no way to subtract sugar alcohols along with fiber; therefore, an Atkins product, for example, that really has 3 net carbs will show up on this app as having consumed 13 net carbs-very deceiving  and also impossible to keep your carb limit. Also, this app has a blank for every other nutrient etc that you can think if but no sodium intake option. In addition the app is much slower than it should be. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is trying to stick with net carb intake limits.

Title: Not happy about update
----------------------------------------------------------
Before when I was using the app you used to be able to scan a food in the grocery store and it will tell you the food rating like saying avoid or moderation or good. Now when I scan items in the store it is extremely frustrating to not see the grade because that is what helped me the most. I reached out to customer support and never heard anything back. Is anybody else having these issues?It is a major buzz kill that it does not say this anymore. There are a lot of items in the store that you think would be keto friendly and when I scanned them and it says it’s not that helps me more than just seeing the macros that are posted now with this upgrade

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there! We still have Keto Grades: Friendly (green) Limit (yellow) Strictly Limit (red) Avoid (red)- so you can still check the food items while you're grocery shopping! If you need additional assistance with the Keto Grades or anything else, please reach out directly to support@carbmanager.com and reference your User App Review Name. We'll make certain that someone responds to your email ASAP!

Title: Wrong Calculations - Do not recommend for ketogenic dieters
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded this app to help my boyfriend track his macros while he loses weight on Keto. The app told him he needed to consume 3007 calories a day. I knew this was wrong because that’s more than recommend amount for a normal diet, and you’re trying to lose weight you’re going to have to take some type of calorie deficit. I’ve also done Keto before so I knew just by the calories it was telling him to consume too much. Long story short looked online for some help and came across a program that lets you calculate what your daily macros would be while on keto, and it said he should be taking in 1779 calories a day. HUGE difference from 3007.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for contacting us! Could you message us via the Settings > Support Center? We can take a look at your account and see where the high calorie calculation came from. If a value like weight or height was entered incorrectly in your profile, the calculator may have used that value to arrive at the higher calorie goal. In any case, please contact us and we'll get it figured out!

Title: No free trial for premium
----------------------------------------------------------
I got the app today and right away I seen restrictions in order to get me to go and buy premium. I would not mind going premium if I got to test it first to see if I like it or not. Maybe they should consider offering a free month, or evenv2 weeks free premium to allow people to see if they like it before having to pay for it. I read a lot of good reviews about the app and it is a shame I may not be able to fully test the premium service because I would love to see if I liked it or not before I drop $40 for the year of premium service. Maybe even offer a first month of premium service for $1 so people can test it? Something would be nice

Title: Not user friendly
----------------------------------------------------------
I had heard that this app was good for tracking a keto diet. I downloaded app and found there wasn’t much to do without subscribing. So I subscribed, paid over $16 for 3 months, and immediately was disappointed. I was trying to find my way around the site and somehow their shared recipe ended up in my meal diary for the day. I tried to erase it and again that was not simple. Then when I went to add my actual meal, I saw that I had to add all the data for every part of my meal... this is understandable, but very frustrating coming from a “free” meal tracking app which can take most of this info just from a bar code or from a data base.

Title: Hate, hate, hate & more hate this new upgrade!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Yesterday in the middle of shopping, and trying to scan a barcode quickly, a new viewing platform appeared.  And it’s AWFUL!   It’s visually unappealing, huge, clunky, useless, takes too many clicks to get things that were easily accessible, no option to go back to old view, no warning.  I pay for my subscription and have for about three years.  I will be cancelling now.  This interface is abysmal.  Carb Manager developers, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!  You ruined a really good thing.  So damned frustrated/diet derailed.  I use this to track carbs for epilepsy, so I don’t have seizures.  You made this so much harder.

Title: Hate the new update!
----------------------------------------------------------
I was excited to try the new update since the old Carb Manager was a little dated looking. I wish I hadn’t updated. The new app experience is confusing and definitely not user friendly. I could deal with that but it’s also messed around with some of my settings and even some of the foods that I had created. I’ve wasted so much since I updated yesterday just trying to get this back to where I can use it and I’m really irritated. I’m a Premium member and I loved the ease of Carb Manager before and I’ve tracked religiously but unless I can get the old app back, I think I’m going to be looking for a new app.

Title: New “improvements”
----------------------------------------------------------
I have found the new and improved version of Carb Manager much more difficult to use. I couldn’t find where to track my weight. I tried to use Help and Support, but it just redirected me to goals. Entering data there erased my previous information. Worse yet, it said something about only being able to track body data with the premium version, which I bought about 6 months ago and it now does not recognize. All previously entered “meals” and customized foods (basically anything I created in the old version of the app) are not recognized by this upgrade and no longer available. Eight months of data gone.

Title: Garbage update
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has been my go-to for tracking while doing keto for almost a year. Since the most recent update, it has deleted all of the foods I commonly use, it’s become so much harder to track foods and the foods in the app aren’t accurate to what the label says per serving. This app is now garbage. I’ll be looking for a different app to use now because this update has made it much harder to track things unless they go back to how it was. It’s already hard enough trying to diet and track foods why would they go on and try to make it even harder for everyone. No one likes this update. Change it back.

Title: They broke it, look for an alternative
----------------------------------------------------------
I have faithfully tracked my foods daily for the 20 months I’ve been on keto and have credited the premium subscription version of Carb Manager for being able to do so easily. With this new update, however, they have royally screwed up a great product (think New Coke). It is unusable. It is slow, you literally can’t read text because gray text is on colored boxes that obscure it, foods have disappeared and the charts are useless. Unless they put back the original, look elsewhere. That’s what I’m on the App Store for now. It’s not worth it to use the free version, much less a premium subscription.

----------------------------------------------------------
Couldn’t wait to start counting carbs with this app. First day I’ve had it I deleted it. It’s similar to my fitness pal except almost every food I added to my meal didn’t log. 3 things added and then it just stopped. Over and over again. Reset the app. Again, no matter how many times I added the foods it didn’t add to my list but I could feel the add button submit just fine, the little vibration on the screen. When I’d go to my list the foods I added weren’t there. I tried over and over. I deleted it and will find something more useful. I was really looking forward to using this app too!

Title: If your not pleased with their app they will not issue a refund
----------------------------------------------------------
I purchased the yearly subscription for this app ($43.29 with tax) feeling after the reviews it was the carb counting app I was looking for. I had used the free version to start with then upgraded to the premium version. I purchased the yearly because it was cheaper that way. After using it for about 3 days I felt it was not the easiest, user friendly app available, too much jumping around from screen to screen, not finding some food or recipe items that I wanted to add to my daily count, some inaccurate macros readings and not much of anything different from the free version, etc.

Title: Latest Version Ruined the App
----------------------------------------------------------
My husband and I started keto 1/1/21 and downloaded this app and found it so helpful. We were able to share foods with each other to make calculating easy. He updated his app and I did not. We are no longer able to share foods because most of the items are gone from the update. The layout is not easy on the eyes either. It looks busy and confusing. I paid for premium and will not upgrade for as long as I can but it’s discouraging for my husband beacause it’s hard to find the same foods to log. If you have not upgraded to the latest version DON’T!!!! If you have, well, I’m sorry.

Title: Think twice BEFORE using this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I’d used Carb Manager premium for a year and a half. It was user friendly, I lost 45 lbs.! Then came the UPDATE!! I have been so frustrated trying to use it, watched all the videos and still struggled. I got to the point that I gave up, cancelled my account and deleted it. I have many friends that have done the same. Why couldn’t you have just left it alone, instead of coming up with a complete new interface. It is like a different app. I would love it if you could bring back the old app and give this one a different name (that is, IF it is actually been successful in any way).

----------------------------------------------------------
As someone who has been keto for years, and has used (and loved) Carb Manager exclusively for tracking daily eating, I am so frustrated. My personal recipes that I have had saved for years now have spontaneous and weird errors in the ingredients now. Trying to edit the errors is maddening because it wants me to re-enter all my recipes? I am all for improvements and changes, but it seems like y’all rolled out a new version without addressing major errors and issues. I am looking at other tracking apps now because this just isn’t working anymore. Disappointed :(

Unfortunately, even when I signed back in with the same email, all of my info was lost and my premium account is lost!

The new update is AWFUL! I have been a daily, faithful Carb Manager app user for a year. The update is HORRIBLE! The app now takes forever to load and it freezes all of the time. Plus, the new weight loss chart is useless! It no longer tells you how much weight you have lost in the last 30 days or even calculates your overall weight loss. I’m looking for a new app to use. I’m just sorry that I will lose all of my history. Carb Manager was with me every step of my journey. But, I can’t deal with this new “update”. It’s the worst!

Title: Paying for Accuracy but CM is Waaaay Oof!

I have been inputting recipes to track my macros accurately but when I add them to my daily log they do add to my daily totals and actually change them to be lower. For example, I made a special dinner for us last night which included Keto Beef Stroganoff. One serving accurately tallied is 43.6 g of fat (which is why I don’t make it often!) but when I put it into my daily log which already had 30 g of fat, CM said that I only logged 23 g of fat for the day! Come on CM, I am paying for “Premium” and this is the best you can do??

I have been using the app for years, but now when I upgraded to the latest version, it turns out the app doesn’t function without an internet connection.

I would expect the app to be able to store nutrition info for recently viewed items as well as custom foods and favorites. I don’t expect it to fit the full database on my phone, but when I am out of internet coverage, I want to be able to enter foods that I use often.

After using carb manager for 3 years, I’ve came to realization that there are better user friendly apps. Ive enjoyed this app for I had lost 100 pounds and am now in the best shape of my life thanks to carb manager, no doubt. But ever since carb manager dev team updated it, it’s just not the same anymore. To confusing. Not user friendly. Prior to the update, the interface was very easy to maneuver through. Until they have a option to use the older interface, I’m going to delete this, cancel my premium, and look else where.

Every feature worth using on this app costs a premium subscription. Not even a free trial to see if it would be worth the cost of the subscription. I mean seriously... what if I don’t care for your idea of a meal plan? Or the recipes I find are just too out there for my taste? And I opt not to continue using this app? Then I’ve paid for something I’m not using. It’s a waste of money without allowing me limited time trial access to see if what’s available is worth it to me to actually pay to continue receiving the content.

Title: All My Favorite Foods Gone
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve use this app for almost a year now and just loved it. This week they upgraded it and made it awful. All of the foods I had saved are gone off my program and it is a completely changed and not user-friendly. I am so disappointed with this company I wouldn’t even have given them one star but I couldn’t write a review without  choosing, so I’d like to make it -5 stars instead. Please restore what was wonderful with this program. Did you ever think of asking your users what they thought before you changed it all?

Title: App not loading properly
----------------------------------------------------------
So I bought the paid subscription and I love this app but it makes me upset when I’m trying to input my macros and it won’t open. I don’t have a good memory so I have to use another app to hold my macros until this one comes back online. With this being a paid app I may look for a different one when my subscription ends in a year unless this bug gets fixed. So sad though because this is a great app to keep track of your day if eating. The recipe part is awesome too. Please fix the glitch so I can keep this app.

Title: I want my money back.
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been a premium member for almost two years and loved this app. The new version has ruined my experience. It lags while loading and sometimes I just give up and try later.  You cannot add to my foods list with the new version, there isn’t even an option. If you change the unit of measure (cup, gram, oz) it gets confused and you have to back out and try again.  Also, whyndominneed to see my week on the daily page. Just too cluttered and small.  Your developer needs a kick in the butt. This app is ruined.

Title: Good app but food database is lacking
----------------------------------------------------------
Unlike fitness pal this app does NOT have a lot in their food database. I’m finding myself needing to manually add items of food that I consume even when scanning the UPC barcode of the food items. Plus some of the macros of the selections they have are off. For example, they have sea scallops as 5 grams of carbs?! They should be at least 1 or even 0 grams. The development team needs to improve this feature. Oh and the new update is awful. Whenever I do attempt to scan a barcode, the app crashes every time.

Title: Gone down hill
----------------------------------------------------------
We used to love this app, but now find it nearly impossible to find the right food to add. If you can find it the carbs and calories are completely wrong when you compare it to nutrition sites. Nearly double the calories in many cases. If you still decide to use this app knits know it isn’t accurate, so double check on sites such as nutritionix or other sites. Don’t even think about a simple search such as “boiled Potatoes” as it will return meatloaf and mashed potatoes and all sorts of unrelated foods!

Title: Worked great....for a day
----------------------------------------------------------
I got this app two days ago and loved the ease of use.  Then it stopped working.  It seemed to freeze up not letting me click on anything, add anything, basically it was just an image on the screen.  I deleted the app and reinstalled it. After that it worked fine again....for about three hours. I'm about to delete it a second time and probably for the last time.  I wish it worked the way it is supposed to as I really liked all of the features. Unfortunately I have to advise you - don't waste your money.

----------------------------------------------------------
Do not purchase this app.  Upgraded to premium to use the Apple Health integration and all it did was freeze up every time.  The support is a joke.  Sent an email to their support and didn't not receive anything back.  Why is Apple letting a bogus company rip off its users?  So, I considered my $20 a lost and continued to use the app.  Just updated to the latest version and it wiped out all of my data.  The data is still online but it is no longer syncing with the app.  Just a piece of crap application.

Title: TERRIBLE NEW VERSION- 7!
----------------------------------------------------------
Most successful apps roll out small improvements, not a complete overhaul all at once! Expecting users, especially those who paid for Premium, to take extensive time & effort to learn & navigate something that already worked well is totally irresponsible & uncaring of your loyal users. Based on the outpouring of frustration via social media & groups, I know I’m in the majority of loyalists who feel duped & sold something on a bait & switch platform now. Trying to get a refund now, but get no response.

Title: DO NOT get the new update to v 7
----------------------------------------------------------
This new update is beyond HORRIBLE. I am so angry that all my recipes that I spend hours each week developing and tweaking are now incorrectly calculating my macros and sometimes missing info. The visual layout is useless. I can’t import recipes from my favorite websites any longer. I also can’t share info easily with my husband who also uses the app. Bottom line is that all the features and functions that brought me to CM are not working or effectively gone. I will be canceling my subscription ASAP.

Title: Horrible app!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Whatever you do, don’t waste your money to purchase premium version!  This app arbitrarily assigns calories and macros to food which is just ridiculous. For instance 1200 cal, 70g fat for 2 cups black coffee!!  There is no possible way you can adequately track your macros. Also not user friendly and very difficult to add foods. Keeps assigning breakfast foods in lunch category etc. you can edit it, but will often go back to original when re-opening the app. Again, this is HORRIBLE. Find a better one!

----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve written this review twice already. Keeps disappearing when I try to send it. Funny, huh? I’m not bothering to write it again. I will say that they destroyed a perfectly useful app worthy of ongoing subscription and replaced it with garbage. I have deleted my subscription and am searching for a competitor. Too bad. They used to be the best keto app out there. Should they listen to their customers and bring back the previous version, I would happily rejoin, but as it is now? I want my money back.

Title: Trying to Upgrade Failed
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been using the free version for a couple of weeks now and very pleased with the App.  A couple days ago Carb Manager offered a special price of $29.00 for the one year subscription. I decided to upgrade and went through the sign up. It posted to my bank account that there was a pending charge.  Never received any info from the company/app that it was upgraded.  Several days later the pending was removed from my bank account.  I’ve tried everything to communicate with the company to no avail!!

Sorry to hear you're having some issue accessing your Premium features! We can assure this is an easy fix, and can get you upgraded in no time. Please reach out to us in-app by selecting "Need help?" and we can get it sorted out, if it hasn't already. Thanks!

----------------------------------------------------------
Title says it all. I used it for a month with no real complaints to speak of, got a notification for an update, did the update and it kept asking for me to enter my email and password even though I was still logged in. Logged out and couldn’t log back in because I forgot my password, reset my password and logged in, found all my information gone and my year of paid subscription gone... not sure how this kind of thing happens. Very unsatisfied right now, and that’s putting it very very lightly.

----------------------------------------------------------
It works fine but I personally found low carb unpalatable on a long term basis.  I want to cancel my subscription but can’t find a way to do it. In settings the website option says it will send an email with instructions. Tried it twice and received no email.  Tried the iPad option and it only allowed a change in the billing period/type but no option to cancel.  This seems pretty shady way to keep a subscription running when a person wants to cancel.  Could someone advise me how to cancel?

Title: What a farce
----------------------------------------------------------
I don’t see how this app has so many positive reviews. I couldn’t use one function on this app without being asked to purchase premium. It didn’t say you HAD to purchase premium to even remotely be able to use this app or search recipes. Can’t search recipes, can only pretty much track your macros if you self put in everything. I have a free app much more user friendly than this frustrating thing. It’s called my fitness pal. And don’t get a “buy premium” smack in the face with every click.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hey Ginger2112, thanks for the feedback. Carb Manager is free to use. The free version allows you to do everything you need to stay on track with keto: set your goals; search & view net carbs & macros on over 1M+ foods; track your macros, exercise, and water; create custom foods & recipes; chart your weight; join our community; and much more. We have an optional Premium upgrade -- including exclusive recipe & meal plans we developed ourselves -- that allows us to fund our business and keep the rest of the app totally free. Hope this helps 😃.

----------------------------------------------------------
I got this for a month and had issues all month. Database is incorrect on many foods macros and not having them on file. Server issues several days this month. Also i find that the computation for macros is inaccurate. Im unable to override the calories or macros to what I know should be accurate for myself. I got my refund and am returning to “my fitness pal”. The only upside to CM features was it allows us to track net carbs vs total.  Its not worth the hassle of everything else.

I have used Carb Manager for several years and loved it. I have the paid subscription. This latest update is terrible. It is very hard to find items. Your favorites don’t come up. Recipes are missing. There’s a glitch when you want to change your daily items amounts and it won’t let you change them. There needs to be a lot of changes made to get the app back to the valuable tool that it used to be. If the app does not improve by the time my renewal is due in May I will not renew.

This program was working pretty well until they just did an update the other day and now it doesn’t show me my daily totals it only shows a week total. If I want to know how many calories total I’ve eaten that day I have to go find a calculator and add it up myself manually. I’ve sent several requests to the company and they sent me this lousy email that does not answer any of my questions. Poor customer service hate the new update. Canceling my subscription and going elsewhere.

I found this app a couple of years ago and really fell in love with it. The upgrade has ruined it for me as well as for most of the longtime customers. I decided not to renew and made a decision to go back to the LoseIt app since they have made tremendous improvements on carb tracking, macro management, as well as a bunch of great new features. It’s a cleaner platform and much easier to navigate. Wishing all the customers best of luck in trying to navigate the new version chaos.

I was hopeful for this app since there seem to be very few apps that want to target limiting sugar/carbs that make actually work. The search engine is terrible. I try to search for a Hamburger patty (0 carbs) and it keeps popping up a Whopper from Burger King. There are no options to strip things off the meal in question and the one listing that didn't mention a bun still listed a patty as having 23 Carb units. I wasted 2.99 on this when I could have bought another hamburger, :)

----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been using this app almost 2 years and loved it. However, this update is horrible. It’s taking longer to do things, and finding foods is horrendous. I was looking for Peanut Butter in the search, and everything but PB came up, and it seems to be only looking at my foods. I checked “all”, cleared all filters, still no luck. It used to be so easy to find foods, because most store bought things are already in the system. Now, not so much. So irritating. Not happy at all.

Title: Annoyed
----------------------------------------------------------
Okay, the app LOOKS good, however, as a long time user of MFP I am used to being able to search meals and add that way. The only way to do that on this app is to pay for premium. So, I can’t even really try it out the way I want to without either entering every ingredient individually (which I don’t mind sometimes, but I don’t want to do it all the time). I probably would have paid to try a month. But I am not paying for a year when I don’t know if I actually like the app.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hey there, and thanks for your review! You can add Meals in our free version, as well as add individual ingredients, as you've been doing, if they're not found in our database. Also, we want to point out you can always purchase a 1 month or 3 month subscription of Premium instead of our annual option if you'd like. Message us in-app for more info! Thanks!

This was the best app for LC/Keto tracking,  was so easy to navigate. Then they updated it in 2/8.  Lost all my saved info fir my recipes and frequent foods, the macros are off on a ton of foods and it so clunky to even understand what you’re looking at or how to add foods.  Why would you upgrade something that was the most highly rated app to this garbage?  Hope the change this back to the way it was.  If it ain’t broke.....  Highly disappointed.

Title: Premium not updating my Macros correctly
----------------------------------------------------------
I loved this app, and have used it for 2 years without trouble.  However, this past week, it stopped updating my Macro-goals.  It is supposed to give me “smart goals” based on my current weight, activity-level, and % Calorie-Reduction desires.  Very frustrating, bcs my Daily-Tracker makes no sense at all, with the wrong Calories and Macros now.

Title: Please Roll Back the Version
----------------------------------------------------------
This app was not ready to be released. The search function has taken many steps backwards and I can’t find my usual foods without spending time looking.  The “My Macros” view no longer provides the actual percentage carbs, fat, and protein. This was the main reason I use this app and pay the yearly subscription fee.  It is a dealbreaker without this view. On a positive note, I think that the graphical presentation is much improved, just wish the function was up to speed.

----------------------------------------------------------
So tired of these apps that present themselves as free. I just installed it and was using it for 10 minutes. Trying to figure things out. I had added some food for the day but then made some revisions. And with that came the pop up that only 9 meal actions are allowed for free per day. Think of all the things you have to enter. Coffee, milk, eggs, butter, cheese, tomatoes. Breakfast was already six things. Any corrections also count. This essentially is a pay app.

Also much more difficult to actually maneuver around the app. UPDATED to add, newest update and it is WORSE!

----------------------------------------------------------
With all the foods out there, I'd say this app only list .001 of them and it doesn't give you the option of adding your own info which you got right off the container. It also doesn't let you use a barcode scanner to automatically enter information. The idea of buying an App is to be able to use it. With MyFitnessPal you can add foods to the App by entering them manually or by using your barcode reader on your cell phone, 1 beep and it's entered! And it's Free!!!

I’ve been using this app as a premium user for a long time and previously loved it. There are sooo many issues with this latest update. Recipes that I created over the years are gone. Many foods that I saved are gone. You can no longer add foods from a recipe individually. So many more issues. Come on developer, this was not ready for prime time.

Hi Meepersmonkey! Thanks so much for that feedback and for your support as a Premium member.

Title: Watch out- you'll subscribe to premium
----------------------------------------------------------
Ok app for carb counting. Watch those fingers or you'll end up subscribing to premium which is a RIP OFF for $39.99.  Complete rip off.  Did not get the "warning" courtesy button, like "are you sure you want to subscribe?" Like you do with other apps.  Sneaky way for them to steal $40 bucks from you. That is messed up. Impossible to get a refund.  Look elsewhere for carb counting or do it on your own.  After a few weeks you WILL get good at counting.

Title: Not good
----------------------------------------------------------
The problem with this is it doesn’t tell you what the serving size is. Although it has great recipes,  you can find recipes anywhere. The app gives you the totals for the entire dish but that’s common on any recipe. This is supposed to be a carb manager app. The whole point is..  we’re supposed to be managing carbs. And when it says 8+ servings it doesn’t tell you what a serving of the dish is. It’s pointless!!  That’s the only thing we needed!!!

Title: Everything is wrong
----------------------------------------------------------
Their app and website NEVER work properly. The links to their terms of service and privacy policy does not work. You click on the page and it’s a broken page or the page says “Oops! Nothing here.” I refuse to pay for something that does not let me read the fine print. Please do not tell me where to find the T&C and Privacy Policies again, considering I obviously know where they are supposed to be located however they are not actually there!

Title: Misleading app
----------------------------------------------------------
I purchased the app because it is a family share app and when I purchased premium my spouse could not use it. So after searching and asking Apple support they referred me to your website. I am highly disappointed and feel misled by you. You tout family share and the conditions that go along with it, but you bury the most important part regarding your premium service. Which was the SOLE reason I spent 39.99 on the app, the ability to share!

Title: Where do I begin?
----------------------------------------------------------
Why did you have to fix something that wasn’t broken?  I’ve had this app since last March.  It was practically flawless and easy to use.  Since the app was updated a few days ago, it has lost most of my food history of things I eat on a regular basis.  Have to rescan everything only for it to tell me it can’t find the item where as the old version was able to.   This is just one of many things that make this app pretty much useless now. 🙄

Title: Not working & is not consistent
----------------------------------------------------------
I bought the premium & used it for a couple of weeks & now all it keeps saying is internet not available. All my other apps are working so I know it’s not the case. Also I had a food entered from a previous day & go to select that same entry & all of the grams of that food are gone. This is very frustrating & I don’t even know if I’ve had it for a month. I even looked to see if there was an update I missed. Can you fix this or help me????

Title: Used to be great ... but not since the update
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to love using this app but I hate it since the “update”. If I could get my money back for my current subscription, I’d do it in a heartbeat. Never again. I don’t know how the app has close to a 5 star rating when everyone in my keto groups on social media hate it. Most say they wouldn’t have paid to subscribe the way it is now. Looking for a different app that is more user friendly and less time consuming than this app is now.

Title: I deleted this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I really am focusing on getting 10,000 or more steps each day. The ability to record steps accurately in this app is lacking. Also, once steps are recorded for the day, changes cannot be made. If steps are accidentally recorded on the incorrect date, the record cannot be changed. I had used the WW app previously and had become used to a well-designed and user-friendly app. I selected this one because at this point I need a free app.

Title: Loved and then disappointed.
----------------------------------------------------------
Loved this app for two weeks and purchased the premium. Then my Fitbit stopped syncing. I followed the direction to go to website found that it wouldn’t link up with my phone so then followed direction to fix that and lost all my data. Now the app won’t give me the same goals as before and when I went to renter a recipe it won’t add it to my daily totals even though all the information seems correct and saved in the recipe.

Title: Disappointed with the changes
----------------------------------------------------------
I loved this app, it really helped me on my keto journey. One of the things I loved most about it was that I could enter my food for the upcoming days when I had my meals planned out. Not anymore! I tried to use that function today and I’m being told I need to upgrade to premium. Why?! There are already so many functions I don’t have access to as a free user. And I’m fine with that. Don’t take away functions we already had.

Title: WAS Great, Now Lame. Disappointed w/New Update
----------------------------------------------------------
IT WAS GOOD. However, This recent and stupid update is awful and makes it harder to navigate the app. I appreciate the clean and fresh layout but The layout is way too intricate for no reason.  Also, the nutrition labels on foods is INCORRECT now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That’s probably the worst part. Im in a Keto group and many of my fellow Keto people are so unhappy with this new update. It also makes it confusing for beginners.

Title: Hot Garbage
----------------------------------------------------------
This app used to be the simplest and easiest app to use to track your macros. Their recent tricked out update has made it unusable. They will tell you it might get some getting used to but the bottom line is that it has become a complex mess to find, add, and edit foods and recipes quickly and easily.  More is not always better.  Paying for the upgrades arent worth it. This used to be so easy- try something else instead.

Title: The worse app ever
----------------------------------------------------------
I paid a 3 month subscription for premium and I was never able to do anything except to long my meals I ask for help from the support center and they never responded. When I canceled my subscription they try and charge me for the year subscription again but I had already disputed the charges form the first transaction so my bank didn’t let the second transaction go through. Worst app ever! Do not use it save your money.
