Title: A Godsend for a type 1 diabetic
----------------------------------------------------------
As a type 1 diabetic who uses an insulin pump, one of the most frustrating requirements for keeping my glucose levels on target is to accurately calculate the carb content of every meal and snack so I can enter that information into my pump for it to compute a proper ‚Äúbolus‚Äù so I get the correct amount of insulin to cover the meal. The pump is an essential tool to flatten the curve in my glucose levels but it‚Äôs often only as accurate as my best guess on the carbs in a food item. My Fitness Pal has taken so much of the guesswork out those calculations with its large library of food items and serving sizes so I simply search the library and then determine portion size and it tells me exactly what I need to know. My doctor is going to love the improvement this is going to bring to my A1c numbers. Trying to minimize less healthy processed food in my diet is important too and that means preparing ‚Äúreal food‚Äù from scratch. Fortunately, I love to cook and collect/create new recipes but then you‚Äôre back to guesswork when it comes to the crucial nutrition information until I discovered I can enter my recipes right into the system and have it correctly provide the nutrition information I need. Even eating out, you can get nutrition info on foods from most national brand restaurants.   now use this virtually every day for everything I eat. Keeping that daily diary has had other benefits like a measured reminder about staying within my goals without my wife having to constantly ‚Äúremind‚Äù me. I‚Äôm not seriously overweight but could benefit by getting closer to my ideal weight and simply knowing if something I planned to eat will put me over my goals, I reduce the portions accordingly and the weight is just coming off. Because exercise is a part of that daily log it helps me be more consistent in at least getting a walk in every day which has motivated me to enhance my exercise efforts beyond just walking. A big plus is that I can export this activity and correlate it with the logs from my pump so I can identify specific foods or eating patterns that contribute to the highs and lows I need to monitor for better health. I love the tools this provides and especially the fact that it is so convenient and easy. It has helped me achieve the best glucose and weight control I‚Äôve had in years. I love this thing.

Title: THE most simple and helpful encouragement available!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am not one to write reviews but this app deserves the accolades! I have been very fit my whole life; lean and athletic. I have lifted weights since college and running has been a life-long passion and pleasure! Then...I hit menopause and let me tell you...my metabolism just stopped!!! In 6 months I gained a fifth of my body weight and, embarrassed, I started to isolate. I went to the doctor to find out what is going on and she recommended nothing except that I use this app!!!! I am so glad I did!! It has shown me tendencies I was unaware of because I never needed to think of it before. I cannot say enough good things about this! It‚Äôs easy regardless of your IT skills, quick to use so you can keep it updated throughout the day, personalized (even without upgrading to a paid version), encouraging, private (or can team up with my mom and my daughter...or even make it public if I wanted), you can set it up to give you reminders, and the food list is complete...restaurants and name brands from the grocery are all there...so far, in 2 weeks I have not come across a food that isn‚Äôt listed, and to add a personal recipe is more simple than writing the recipe out to keep in your recipe book. In 2 weeks I‚Äôve lost 2 pounds and I am starting to feel better - more energy and hot flashes (which are NO JOKE!!!) are getting better. I have learned so much about my personal style and pattern of eating. Prior to this app most people I know would consider me knowledgeable about fitness and nutrition...but now I am also knowledgeable about ME so I can actually apply the knowledge I have to my problem habits and styles. I encourage anyone regardless of your age, purpose, and fitness or nutrition knowledge and experience to get this app! I thank my Father for the team that provides this great app and with His help and this app may we all take better care of the bodies He gave us!! I sincerely hope you find it to be as helpful, encouraging, and satisfying as I have!! Be BLESSED!!! üòÉ

Title: Life Changing
----------------------------------------------------------
I cannot say enough good things about this app.  I am a woman in her 60's, and believe me, at this age it is very difficult to lose weight.  Each decade you can notice the difference in how your metabolism slows down.  I had been trying for over a decade to lose some meaningful weight, and not just a couple of pounds.  But, I would start, lose a few, and my body would refuse to lose anymore after a week or so, then I would give up.  I only succeeded in staying about the same--way to much!!  Then I started using this app and lost 62 LBS! It took me almost 20 months (45 in the first year), but during those 20 months I had 5 beach vacations (4 one week, and 1 two week) and all the numerous holidays and two family reunions.  Normally, that would totally derail a diet, but I kept logging daily, and during those times I counted it a moral victory because I may not have lost anything but, I also did not gain anything!  This app allowed me to live my life normally, eating the same foods as my family and friends at functions.  I learned portion control and it encouraged me to become even more active than I was.  I didn't lose it quickly, but then again it had taken me years to gain it in the first place.  This past January (my 1st anniversary using the app) my two daughters began using it, also.  The youngest lost 24 lbs. and reached her goal (continues to log) and her older sister has lost 44lbs. and wants to lose about 13 more.  Thank you so much for this wonderful tool!  Now my sister is using the app and losing, too.  Wish this technology could have been available when I was younger.  Thank you, Thank you, thank you, MyfitnessPal!  I will continue to log to help me maintain my weight level.

Title: Amazing for weight gain
----------------------------------------------------------
This is by far the best fitness app out there. I am 5‚Äô3 and with an inconsistent weight that jumps from anywhere between 96 pounds at my best and 88 pounds at my worst. I have tried different things and fitness apps for years and this is the first time I found one that I consistently use and that keeps me on track. I am amazed by all the things that are included in the free service (the calorie diary, nutritional reports, and select fitness videos)! The app gives you a recommended caloric and nutritional intake based on your height and weight and your goals (weight loss, gain, or maintaining your weight). It also logs your steps and you can add different types of exercise that will adjust your needed caloric intake based on your activity for the day. If this sounds complicated, I promise you it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs a pretty simple app to use. The nutritional log is done automatically for you based on the foods you input. The calorie diary is so useful and so much easier than counting calories yourself. You can just search a food and add whatever serving size you had to your diary (it is very specific! You can input different measurement like ounces or grams or just the recommend serving size for the specific food and you can input servings sizes as small at 1/8th) and it calculates both caloric and nutritional intake, this is by far my favorite feature because often times I do not eat the recommended serving size and have a hard time trying to manually calculate how many calories I‚Äôm eating. So far I have not been able to find a food that isn‚Äôt listed on the app, including foreign food (hard to find on other apps, which is super discouraging to the immigrant user). 100% recommend!

Title: MyFitnessPal Was a Real Pal
----------------------------------------------------------
At the beginning of 2012, I began charting everything I was eating. I weighted 192 lbs. I am female and 5'4". I then looked in the app and saw the proportions of nutrients I was gaining or missing. From then, I could begin controlling my diet. I was losing or gaining slowly, two point kilos daily. I still yo-yo!üòä I weigh 119 lbs. now. My goal is 107. MyFitnessPal offered me chances not only to post dishes from American cuisines, but also dishes from where I lived in the Caribbean and Middle East. Uncommon fruits are listed as well as desserts from around the world. I continue to rely on MyFitnessPal and highly recommend it to anyone serious about keeping track of their nutrition and calories. As a Cancer survivor, MyFitnessPal offers me easy ways to follow prescribed restrictions.üòçIn addition to MyFitnessPal, I weigh myself daily and post in lbs. & kilos. Each month, I can see more easily where I was and am. I found looking at kilos and point kilos far more inspiring than looking at pounds. You can clearly see the point gains and losses which contributes to one's motivation level. It is true, managing a diet using a mobile app is easier. It took a long time to create a lifestyle of maintenance. I see it as one being hyperconscious in planning meals ahead. I advise serious dieters not to eat out often, and have a low calorie beginning of the day. Have a healthy snack before going. Avoid doggy bags. They can be a trap. Order low calorie entr√©es and enjoy your dessert. MyFitnessPal will remain a lifelong pal.

Title: A heaven sent app!
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for an awesome app! I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes 8 weeks ago and I have to keep track of my food intake.  This is perfect for the task.  I can log my food, create meals so I don‚Äôt have to log it all separately however, you have to be mindful of the entries you choose and match up nutrition information- the green check mark by a listing helps. If it has no green check, scroll down to see nutrition amounts and per serving.  This app has so many food listings, it is not difficult to find the name brands you use. I have been following the Diabetic exchange list, so any entry has to be tailored for those portion sizes. Like a serving on a food or on a food container is different from the amount allowed on the exchange list.   Which is not a big thing for logging with myfitnesspal.  You can adjust the serving size. The only thing that is difficult with type 2, the carb intake is adjustable to compensate blood sugar and so if my limit is 105 carbs per day, it makes me over on healthy fats and protein as everything has to add to 100% of intake. I haven‚Äôt figured that part out yet, however, with the calculations on MyFitnessPal and mySugr, my blood sugars are in the normal range for someone WITHOUT diabetes!!!! Next testing if I go as I am, my A1c should be around 5.2, which is normal, compared to 10.1 a1c at diagnosis!!  Anyone with diabetes out there who has to watch everything they eat, these apps are perfect!! Thanks again for the app, it‚Äôs awesome!!

Title: I've lost 20 lbs.
----------------------------------------------------------
My strength trainer kept recommending I try MyFitnessPal since I wanted to lose some weight but I resisted for 6 mo. I thought it would take too much time and be annoying. I've never been able to diet because I immediately feel deprived and start eating anything in sight. With weight lifting I lost inches and felt better but hit a plateau. I'm 55 and was a bit depressed that the pounds were creeping on and I couldn't seem to make a difference over the last few years.  In Late December my doctor told me I was pre-diabetic and losing 10lbs. would probably help my blood sugar levels. So I got serious and decided to start recording everything I ate and did for exercise on this app. I was completely honest with myself and recorded every little thing. I started finding out all the great tools on the app. and got addicted to recording and tracking. I love being able to look back over a week to see how my nutrition is and what I need to balance. I basically have a healthy diet and lifestyle but the app let me fine tune portion sizes and gives me positive feedback daily even though losing weight was not apparent until several months passed. I as able to feel successful daily. I set my goal to lose one pound per week and I could see on the app what a difference it made daily when I made different choices. I have started walking more with friends, biking, dancing and adjusted portions. Now I'm at my goal weight after six months and very happy with this app!

Title: Lost menopause weight gain
----------------------------------------------------------
I was fortunate throughout my life to not have to worry about what I ate as far as weight gain goes. Once I was in peramenopause I started to gain weight. Over a two-year period I gained 12 pounds and was completely confused as to why I put on the weight, and how I was going to lose it. For someone who never had to diet before, I was at a loss. I mention something to my niece who is very physically fit, and very weight conscious and she turned me onto this app. I lost all 12 pounds, and I'm working on losing an additional 4 pounds which will put me back into where I have been weight wise throughout most of my life. I was told by so many people that I had to just except weight gain as a part of menopause. I'm so glad I didn't listen to those people, because I tried accepting the weight gain for two years and was totally unhappy with it. If you want to lose weight try this program, it works! It makes you very aware of what you're putting in your mouth, the nutritional value of what you're eating, and how much mindlessly eating you're doing. I cheat every once in a while, but I go right back on the program the day after I've cheated. So, especially for those of you who are in peramenopause or menopause, don't accept the weight gain! Go on this program and you'll go back to the body that you had before menopause. Now, you won't have the body you had a 25 years old, but you'll be very happy with what you see when you look in the mirror!

Title: I'm quite impressed and thankful
----------------------------------------------------------
I don't like writing reviews but I'm so impressed by this app that I had to. I'm on a quest to lose weight and get fit and this app has become my go-to essential for keeping a log of what I eat and my exercises. I love how big the selection is. I haven't searched for anything that hasn't come up and I'm so surprised because I wasn't expecting some of the foods to be in their database. Also, the scanner. I can freakin scan foods and drinks and it logs it away for me. This app is a must. I've been telling my friends like I'm some kind of club promoter. Come on and join the fun. Lol. I've only been using it a short time and I'm still discovering nifty things I didn't know the app could do. I have other fitness and food apps and this has replaced every single one of them. Fast foods, vegan foods, fitness apps, etc. Besides the app being great on the capabilities, it's easy to use and I haven't experienced anything like it crashing or anything along those lines. I'm using iOS 8 w/ an iPhone 5s. Not sure if that makes a difference. But it's just in case anyone was wondering. Also to the developers, you guys and gals are changing lives for the better with this app. This app was the motivation I needed to be stricter and more consistent. It helped restore my hope and I'm sure I'm more health conscious now. I could definitely go on and on. But I'll end it here with a BIG THANK YOU from the bottom of my healthier heart. {^_^}

Title: Most important & Most used app of all
----------------------------------------------------------
After a downloading and using the 30 day FREE TRIAL Premium subscription for 16 consecutive days, MyFitnessPal has become my most important & most used app out of all my apps; including many social media, finance, editing & streaming apps. MyFitnessPal is amazingly enabling and motivating me to radically improve my diet & fitness, which is crucial to me (and my doctor‚Äôs orders). I am a relatively fit young senior other than some typical senior issues and as I‚Äôve just discovered from a physical, my cholesterol and triglycerides are too high. Also, I‚Äôve lost a lot of muscle mass during the Covid lockdown - not being able to swim or go to the gym, but I‚Äôm now starting other forms of exercise and as I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, I‚Äôm going to rejoin a health club ASAP. All of these life changes are GR8ly supported by my new best friend (Pal). So GR8ful I discovered MyFitnessPal. ***Regardless of your age, weight, and/or goals, YOU NEED THIS APP! Considering it‚Äôs vast and deep database, search and calculation capabilities, and overall technology, I‚Äôm amazed there‚Äôs been no glitches or technical issues. It‚Äôs so far 100% flawless, and a blast to use‚Ä¶ and well worth the expensive subscription price. Now that I know this app is so valuable to me, I‚Äôm going to opt for the yearly rate which is significantly less expensive than paying monthly; not even close. If they had a ‚Äúlifetime subscription‚Äù available, I‚Äôd go for it in a heartbeat!

Title: perfect.
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve always had issues with eating properly. Last year I‚Äôd always skip breakfast, eat a small side for school lunch, and eat a moderate dinner. (I guess it was due to my mental health but I never realized it until nowüòÖ) Anyways, I would repeat this unhealthy pattern and always wondered why I was so skinny. I felt so ugly every time I looked in the mirror, where I criticized and shamed my body until I ran out of insults. For months I tried everything to gain weight, from eating loads of junk food (thinking it would help me) to drinking just protein shakes as a meal. It was up until a few weeks ago when I finally realized I wasn‚Äôt consuming enough calories (alongside the fact that I wasn‚Äôt eating enough). Ever since I got this app (just about 4 weeks ago), I have been eating a healthy amount of food. I‚Äôve gained weight in the places I‚Äôve wanted to gain weight, and I haven‚Äôt felt this happy about my body in years. I‚Äôve always had issues with committing to the daily 2,000 calorie diet, but this app has helped me eat the normal amount and I am so gratefulü•∫. It has also changed my eating habits‚ÄîI used to eat junk food in unhealthy amounts but using this app has helped me stay away from fatty foods and has guided me towards eating not only healthier foods, but eating them in healthy amounts. Thanks to this app, my body finally looks like a normal person‚Äôs body. Thank you so much to the team that keeps this app running.

Title: Time consuming for home cooking
----------------------------------------------------------
I would feel bad about giving this app only three stars since it's free and has helped me lose weight, so I have given it five. However, I find it unnecessarily time-consuming because my family cooks most things from scratch. For example, if I search for plain wheat flour, at the top of the list I will find all kinds of brand names of products with wheat in them. Eventually I will come to a listing for plain wheat flour, but it has a brand name attached to it. If I scroll down, I will find another brand name of wheat flour and the calories don't match up. I don't need 25 listings for eggs ‚Äì I just need to know how many calories are in an average sized raw egg. It is also confusing because I use the metric setting and often need to convert volume to weight and vice versa in order to get consistent measurements. The barcode feature is nifty, and it definitely saves time, but it will sometimes give weird portion sizes that contradict the label. Simply put, the contributions from so many users make the lists messy. It would be SO much better if I could choose foods that I typically use and mark them as favorites instead of having to scroll down through my long list of recent foods, or to search them time and again. An alphabetical custom database function would be fantastic, and solve all of those problems. If the app had had that function, I would happily have paid for it.

Title: Love it!
----------------------------------------------------------
My doctor told me I had to lose weight to help with my diabetes and high blood pressure and I struggled at the beginning with that diet because I wasn't aware of how much I was over eating even though I felt I had cut back on my food. My fitness pal allows me to eat at home and even Dine out and I stay within my 1200 cal a day range without difficulty. Over the last month I have dropped over 16 pounds already! I wasn't aware of how much I was over eating until I started paying attention to portion sizes to make them fit into my 1200 cal intake and my fitness pal helps me through that wonderfully. If you haven't already done so, download the app that the same company puts out call map my walk. You can even have access to your iTunes library through it so you could listen to music while you walk and it will track everything for you and embed with my fitness pal! I have been doing my Wii fit and Zumba to get more exercise and I find that I'm starting to have more energy than I did before I started all of this. I've started making vegetable smoothies and eating lots of high protein. With this app I love how you can just put in everything by ingredient and get a count for a meal that's not on their list, which is massive by the way. I would recommend this app to anybody and everybody who is trying to get into shape and watch their diet and eating habit.

Title: Absolutely Fantastic!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am SO intrigued to monitor my health. Though my weight is well under control, one's over-all health is NOT solely based on weight! This app is a HUGE motivator for me to stay on track in many areas of my health. It is so user-friendly, and I am simply enjoying watching my over-all health improve right before my eyes. I'm so grateful for the app designers who have actually put the "FUN" back into monitoring my health. I am responsible for my personal happiness and my well being! "Life is Good IF you do what you like and like what you do!" Thanks for challenging me to be my best, most authentic self by providing a real "tool" that has inspired me by my results! One truly can take charge of their health & life. NO LONGER does one have to accept the saying, "It is what it is!" Never give your power away! Take control and live your life to the fullest with better health. It's YOUR life; therefore, it's YOUR choice! I'm trying to make wiser choices that will yield more rewarding consequences. I'm 60 years young and living life! My diagnosis resulting in being mentally disabled 10 years ago after experiencing a traumatic brain injury which resulted in brain surgery has provided me with a re-do to once again "live Life". I'm NOT physically hindered, and my life is "exponentially" improving! This app and others keep me motivated, and I'm loving it!!!!!!!

Title: Great App For Personal Health Accountability!!
----------------------------------------------------------
My husband, mother and I made a promise to each other to start taking accountability for our health and stop making excuses for our weight gain and lazy lifestyles. We found My Fitness Pal and gave it a try since it was free. We then discovered there was a free online companion site soon after. All of us have been immensely pleased with the functionality and ease of use with this app and with the online companion site. We often cook at home and this app makes it simple to create your own foods and meals. This has been such a tremendous experience! My mother, husband and I have each lost over 10 pounds in about a month and a half. We feel better already! This app is far more than a calorie counter! It helps to identify nutritional content instead of just calories and also contains many entries for exercise activities. MFP does not, however, count exercise calories accurately but I have found that I actually burn more calories than what MFP calculates, which accounts for such quick weight loss on my part! So I have no complaints really. I have recommended this approach several friends. Some have even come on board and are seeing results within a week! I have also met new friends across the globe and we are all encouraging each other to stay the course to a healthier life!! 5 stars for this app!!

Title: Very very helpful app
----------------------------------------------------------
I was the type of person who avoided tracking calories because I honestly didn't want to admit how much I really consumed on a daily basis. I really like the nutritional breakdown as it helps me  understand the info beyond just calories. As it turns out I was always low fat, high carbs and moderate protein but now I find myself able to enjoy foods I passed on before because they were a bit higher fat than what my mind said was ok. It's very rewarding seeing progress and knowing one bad day won't wreck your overall plan. Once you start you will be hooked if you stick to it and just be honest with yourself. I find extra motivation to run or even walk as I know I get more calories that day, still staying under my daily allotment. My only complaints are minor   - things like adding a lunch that was leftover from dinner last night. Rather than searching from scratch I find its faster to add it as a dinner again and then move or edit it to lunch but it would be nice to see recent meals regardless of which time of day I last had it. This happens to me about 3-4 times a day for things like snack one day that goes with lunch the next. I see lots of posts about privacy but I could care less about who sees my info. I haven't entered anything that I want secret to begin with like pictures, address, etc.

This app used to be super cumbersome and annoying to use.  Now it's pretty seamless... UX has improved much.  And it's pretty accurate with regards to calories consumed.  Calories burned through exercise is very inaccurate however.  It says that for 30 minutes on the stair mill (not the step mill... Very different... Stair mill is the one where you are literally climbing flights of stairs ) I only burn 300 calories but when I've actually used the stair mill with testing equipment I burn appx 600 calories.  If you've ever used the stair mill you'll know exactly what a grueling cardio workout it is and there's no way when doing an intensive cardio on the stair mill that I'm only but in 100 calories every 10 mins.  The elliptical is nowhere near as intense for me (even at the highest resistance settings) and as per this app, it says that I burn more calories on the elliptical.  Def not true.  I barely break a sweat after 10 mins on the elliptical.  Also I wish this app would calculate your estimated BMR and BMI. And for those of us who have been tested and know our body composition percentages, there should be somewhere on your profile where you could input those measurements.  I think it would go a long way into determining more precise measurements for energy expenditure when working out.

Title: This app is my accountabilibuddy!
----------------------------------------------------------
My doctor recommended that I start using an app to count calories or get onto a structured diet like weightwatchers or south beach diet. I am so glad that I decided to go the route of using this app to count calories! With this method I am able to eat fresh non-processed foods. The app tracks all of my activity daily based on my iPhone pedometer and adds those calories back to my daily allowance. If I do exercise other than walking or running it offers a feature to add that too.(e.g. Jumping jacks) All of the foods I have searched for have been in the apps' database. One downfall is some of the food data info is slightly incorrect, but I have been able to find a correct version in the provided list for every food so far. Just be mindful that not all food data is correct or verified. If the food you are searching for has a green check next to it, no need to worry... It has been verified and is trustworthy. I hope the MFP people continue to work on verifying more foods within their app. Overall, I am very excited about this app! I have lost 4 pounds in one week with daily exercise and utilizing this awesome fitness tool. I weighed in at the doctor's office last week at 168.2 and today,one week later, I weighed in at 164. I am pretty much addicted to this app to loose weight and get fit!

Title: So simple and so easy!
----------------------------------------------------------
As my "name" says, you can probably understand I am a very busy mom. I've never taken the time to "rate an app" let alone leave a review. This app has changed my mind entirely; it's so easy to use, even a busy mom, like myself, finds time to log in my daily meals. It's easily accessible, easy to use, and especially easy to log food. With the choice to take a photo of your food items barcode, it makes each entry a less then 2 minute task. Basic logging for eating out is so simple as well; using my location and typing where I've eaten, I'm able to log my exact meal. I have never seen any app like this. I'm very impressed. Also, I'd like to point out, you do NOT have to purchase this app in order to lose weight. It gives you access to the basic food intel, such as calories, fats, carbs, sugars, ext. As well as alerting you if you have eaten to much of, let's say sugar, for the day. A few ads here and there do not bother me the least bit. It has never gotten in the way of my logging for the day. I'm so happy my mother and my doctor told me about this app. I am already well on my way to losing weight, and gaining a better understanding of the foods I eat. I give this app an A+; I can't wait for updates, as each time you think, it can't get any better, it DOES!

Title: Best Fitness App Ever
----------------------------------------------------------
It's Week 2 and I already see Significant changes I've never seen at such capacity and speed before. I used to struggle with Bulimia (purge by exercise+undereating) and then I struggled with Binge eating. Fast forward five years of this back and forth ordeal and I finally sought the advice of a nutritionist who told me about the app. Of all the myriad of things she told me to do, this app is the Number one help. Not only is it easy to use, convenient, and rewarding, it Easily scales my macro and sugar levels. For example, if I undereat in some meals, I can go in and see exactly how much I can consume in snacks to make up for it. I eat dark chocolate, coffee ice cream, fruit, you name it. And I still am losing weight and growing toward my goals! Another great feature is that you can punch in exactly how much you wish to lose, how much you've exercised that day it tracks your daily target for macros, calories, etc. and you can follow it throughout the week, month, year even. And if I am thinking of eating something, I can go in to track it, see how it shifts/alters my eating g plan, and then decide not to eat it and cancel it from the menu. There's also a great feature where you can put in your measurements and update as they change. My Favorite!!!

Title: Really makes dieting easier :)
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using myfitnesspal for 9 days now, and I am truly amazed at how well it works (especially for a free app). While it works very well as is, a couple suggestions for potential new features are: ability to share created recipes with friends (this would be very helpful...maybe it's already possible but I didn't see anyplace where I could do it), ability to track the time of day that meals are eaten and provide feedback accordingly (again, perhaps this is already possible), ability to suggest potential food and/or exercise options to the user based on their current daily calorie count and nutritional intake (e.g., "I see that you like ice cream and haven't had it in a while. If you take a 30 min brisk walk you could indulge in X oz of ice cream tonight); conversely, provide feedback to the user regarding what would be the potential consequences of eating a particular meal / snack, especially once the user has already exceeded their daily target calories (sad to say, I've had a couple weak days...), ability to recommend alternative foods and/or exercises based on user history. Anyhow, these are just suggestions. I'm thankful to the creators of myfitnesspal for having already created a wonderful app and for making it available to us :)

Title: 38lbs. down and maintaining!
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app. I lost 38 pounds with it after years of struggling to lose with no success. It's helped put things into perspective as to how much I was eating, and how bad some of the things I was eating are. It lets me eat what i want without feeling deprived. It's helped me portion control because I'm more conscious of maintaining a decent amount of fat/calories etc. The only hang up for me is that I wish the food items had better descriptions. There appears to be so many variations of certain food items with such a wide range of calories and other nutrients that if you don't have the exact brand, it's hard to know which to choose. For instance, I had a Volcano Roll at a local sushi restaurant, and the choices ranged from 388 calories to 720, but contained no ingredients so I could decide which was closer to what I ate. I had to google search it and find nutrition information on one that was close in ingredients and put it in quick calories instead. I have also stumbled upon the exact same item with different calorie amounts. Relatively minor, considering it just requires me to do a little more digging than I'd like at times. But I recommend to ANYONE I know and anybody who asks how I lost the weight. It's been a dramatic difference.

Title: Amazingly easy to lose lbs with this app
----------------------------------------------------------
Makes it easy to track every last item you eat so you can easily adjust your habits to fit you calorie goal and lose weight. Love the barcode scanner- have not found a food yet that it doesn't have the data for. Allows fractional portions so you can input exactly what you are eating. The integration with the iOS health app is great, and in the newer iPhones it tracks your steps and adjusts calories based in actual activity level. I do wish it tracked a few more nutrients, and split some hairs a bit more like soluble vs insoluble fiber and the like, and had maybe preset nutrient goal levels for higher protein diets and such, though you can do that one yourself.. But I've lost weight constantly since I've been tracking, and my goal of 30lbs off is 1/3 down in just several weeks. I'm positive that continuing with this I can reach what seemed an unreachable goal just a few weeks ago. The tracking of every last food easily is what does it, and the activity tracker makes me turn it up a notch when it's looking like a low activity day. I can adjust my activity and what I'm eating throughout the day to leave room for ice cream or a couple beers later and still stay in the range to lose weight! How could a guy ask for more than that? So awesome!

Title: Thank you so so much for this app
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is a lifesaver for me and I'm sure for others too. I just recently received my ipod touch and this was one of the first apps that I downloaded for my ipod. I always like to read the reviews first before I grab one and I liked what I read. I also downloaded another well spoken for weight loss app called Losin' it and it is somewhat the same but this app is so so much better. With this one I can actually scan the barcode off of labels and it it is very precise. The other app I could never get the bar scanner to work so I deleted it quick fast and in a hurry. I need something to work exactly how it says it's going to work. This app is it. You won't lose out on anything but the weight because this app is FREE. FREE I say so you are not out of anything out of pocket. I love the guys who made this app for people like me who are struggling with the weight and need a helping hand along the way. I am never without my ipod and I use this app whenever wherever except when I can't get a signal. I record every item I eat and every time I burn off calories. This app is very accurate with everything I scan, the foods I manually type in, my workouts, predicted weight loss and everything. Thanks a lot to the creators of this app.

Title: Changed my diet for the better!
----------------------------------------------------------
Last year I used the regular version, and tho I found it easy to use, after a few days and sporadically using it, I lost interest. A week ago I started the paid version, not so much for the extra content, but because for me, I felt I'd use something that I paid for. I was right. I'm much more committed to using it and after the first 8-9 days, find I have lost a half pound. I'm a chronic under-eater & was not getting the nutrition my body needed. Weight is not an issue for me-thanks to good genes, but my health wasn't the best. This app is so easy to use. I can easily enter my meals as I have them, or later in the day. By being able to see my nutrition breakdown, I'm able to watch better what I choose to eat; fat, protein, carbs are all graphically tallied for me to see and adjust my meals. I'm able to track other nutrients as well. I've been able to add my own "meals" and have them saved, since I eat them more frequently, so adding or adjusting recipes of my own is now easy too! It even got me to start walking for cardio again. I'm not sure in a year that I'll need the paid version, but if I do, it will be money well spent. Don't delay; get either version of this app and improve your health and nutrition starting today!

Title: Total Life Changer!!
----------------------------------------------------------
By forcing me to hold myself accountable for my own self-discipline (or lack thereof), this app has helped me to completely transform my way of life, and in turn achieve a level of health I haven't had since I was a child, over 20 years ago. Furthermore, it has helped give me reason to further educate myself about health and nutrition, most especially in the areas where I was previously confused or clueless. If it weren't for this app, I wouldn't be 31 pounds lighter, wouldn't have built great muscle mass to help support my body, would still have terrible cholesterol levels, and would still be suffering with depression and fatigue, and tremendous amounts of pain & discomfort from fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, early degenerative joint & disc disorder and more! As I said, this app is a life changer...IF you'll commit to using it properly. And honestly, it has probably been a lifer SAVER for me, as I was on a very destructive road, going downhill far too quickly, especially to only be 31 yeas old. I recommend this app not only to people trying to lose or gain weight, but to literally everyone, of all shapes and sizes, healthy or unhealthy. You will be surprised at what an effect the use of this app can have on your life!

Title: Great app for nutritional health
----------------------------------------------------------
I use this app, version 6.14.1, at the time of writing, on an iPad running iOS 9.2.1, both and it works great and connects very well to the website of the same name. The purpose of this application is to help one keep track of one‚Äôs dietary and physical habits. It‚Äôs a great tool for one who is trying to lose weight. The most significant part of the application is its calorie counter, and the ease of use therein. Not only can one find any number of foods on the websites seemingly-infinite database with all of their respective macronutrients, for those who keep careful track of such things, but one can also use one‚Äôs device‚Äôs camera to scan the barcode of their foods to find them much easier. To my experience, all of the processed foods I have scanned have been found easily within the database. The application can also recommend dietary habits based upon one‚Äôs given weight, goals, exercise habits, et cetera, meaning those who are lost but want to improve themselves can have a place to start. Not only that, but the website also has a thriving community of people with the knowhow, experience, and desire to help those who are lost. All in all, this application is highly recommended for new and old dieters alike.

Title: A normal dude 32years if age
----------------------------------------------------------
I cant even front. I was skeptical. On 3/5 my wife and a few if her drunken friends decided we were gonna be super trim for the summer. We all got this app, and started monitoring our intake. Our 1st weigh in was 5/5. On 3/5, i was 211lbs. On 5/5, I was 192lbs. I am now 186lbs. I did virtually no exercise. I started doing a few push ups and sit ups just to tone up. Otherwise, id say 98% of the weight i lost was due to simple changes in the way i ate. Just water, wine or liquor(and an occasional beer). No soda, and limited my calories to what my fitness pal recommended and i was good. This is even my 1st app review. I normally dont rate apps but decided that Fitness Pal was def worthy. It was a bit of a challenge at first to condition myself to adhere to the recommended caloric intake, but do it for 21days and it becomes habit. I am forever changed. I even would allow myself a cheat day once a week(usually the day after a night if drinks, and did not register that day in my fitness pal for fear of it throwing up a shaking finger and saying "Shame in you") Good lookin for the genius that created this app. This really changed my life and the way i see food. Now how many calories do i have remaining.....

Title: Great for my needs
----------------------------------------------------------
My nutritionist asked me to use this app and so I am. I eat fairly simply these days so I'm finding what I need. With homemade food of course it's a bit hard to break down, but that's not feesible. So easy to use, much nicer than hauling around a tattered notebook and pen. I like the pop ups that tell you good or kindly negative thoughts on foods you enter. Like how it keeps a nutritional pie chart. And there's a place to journal for food and exercise. AND you get a little pat on the back message every day you complete your journal. Also tells you how much less you'll weigh(or gain I guess) by such and such date if you keep up what your doing each day. Yes you have to find the foods but once on your list always on your list. So as time goes by program takes less time. Removes calories you burned off exercising too. Very motivational. When I can I would like to pay for a year of premium, even better. Thankyou for creating this site, helps me stay on track. My only issue is there are inaccuracies. Case in point: 2 scoops body fortress super advanced whey protein strawberry is 260cals. On the site it's only ninety, huge diff. So need to have your people go through and correct this stuff. There were more

Title: Best thing I've done!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been an athlete and model all my life, tried every pill, shake, supplement, diet. And some worked, I could drop weight but it would come back and I would always feel hungry. Once I found this app it changed the way I look at food. It all came down the the calories for me. Once I had control of portion sizes and really saw what was in the food I was eating I started losing weight. It's so easy! My phone is always attached to my hip. You can scan the product, search it, add it, and even add recipes. I don't have to make a big scene entering it either because it's so easy to access. I'm also a vegetarian and thought I knew a lot a put healthier foods. You make think,"well I can just look at the food labels myself", which is great but this app compares it to how it will effect your daily allowance, because not everyone is on a 2000 calorie diet. I have been able to eat Easter candy,y birthday cake, wine, vodka, anything I want, as long as I'm within calorie range I can still loose weight. It also shows you if you keep eating a certain way what you will weigh in 5 weeks! That number is such motivation! I've been doing it for almost two months and do not plan on stopping! I recommended it to everyone!

Title: It made me realize
----------------------------------------------------------
My New Years resolution was to get to a certain weight that would call for me to lose about 15 pounds. I already ate rather healthy during my meals, but I had a problem with snacking. I wasn‚Äôt at the point of sitting down and eating an entire family bag of chips in one setting. I would however eat a handful here and there, eat 4 Girl Scout cookies twice a day, and some of the candy my grandma loves to send me every and I mean every holiday. I couldn‚Äôt see how much that snacking affected me. My fitness pal has helped me keep track of my calories as I take them in and it has worked wonders! I have been successfully losing weight and it‚Äôs all because I can actually see a number to know how many calories I have left in my day when I go to grab the snack. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong I still snack some, but I‚Äôll do one snack a day now or half of the amount of chips and half of the cookies instead of a large amount. Another thing that this app has helped me with is realizing how I feel after I eat. For example if I am not eating healthier foods I usually feel exhausted the next day. I didn‚Äôt realize it before but now that I have a food diary to look back on I can see what I ate compared to how I feel.

Title: Great! Wish it would account for pregnancy.
----------------------------------------------------------
This is a great application. I've been using it to track my diet because I want to make certain I'm eating all the right foods while I'm pregnant. While pregnant women should not technically diet, this is a prefect application to stay on top of your meals and make sure your nutritional intake is balanced. It's also great to be able to show your doctor your food intake if needed. My only reservation is that you can't add pregnancy as any sort of prerequisite or condition. According to a health journal I read, only 85 extra calories per day are needed in the first trimester, 285 extra calories per day are needed in the second, and 485 additional calories per day are required during the third trimester. While it's simple enough to calculate this, it would be awesome if this app accounted for pregnancy related weigh gain. Regardless, I'm at 14 weeks and my doctor is very happy with my vitals thus far. Additionally, I still fit into all my regular clothes. They are just snug in the waist as expected. I attribute this app to the fact that I'm not overcompensating and look/feel great (for being pregnant). My husband is so impressed that he's now thinking of using it to drop a few holiday pounds.

Title: Can't say enough good things about this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I simply can't say enough good things about this app!  I credit it directly and specifically with helping me to lose 36.5 pounds in the last 17 1/2 weeks!! I am able to incredibly easily track every single calorie to stay on a 2 pound per week average weight loss.  They have such an incredibly complete database of food that I can almost always find any food, fast-food or restaurant menu item!! This makes it much quicker to enter my food choices or even make choices based on calories!  I can repeat meals with a swipe right if I eat the same thing as the day before.  It's very easy to quick add calories if I don't want to put in all the details.  Being so easy to use is why I have been able to be so consistent in using it, which has had a direct impact on my weight loss!  It sets your target calories per day based on your weight and other factors, and how much you want to lose.  It even adjusts your target calories as you lose weight!  I'm a 52-year-old woman who thought it would be impossible to lose weight.  Really using this app has shown me what is possible and I have complete confidence I can lose all of the weight I need to reach my goals!  I tell everyone I know to get this app!!

Title: LOVE LOVE LOVE.
----------------------------------------------------------
36 pounds and counting!!!  I did start with another app (I shall leave it nameless)....however, every time I hit a ten pound milestone, it reduces my calories SIGNIFICANTLY.  At one point it actually suggested my daily caloric intake be 846!  Being in the medical profession, I knew how dangerous- not to mention deadly- that could be. A friend suggested My Fitness Pal.  LOVE IT.  After a month the app suggested the upgraded version. If you're on the fence and you're serious about health, fitness and weight loss the CORRECT AND HEALTHY way...go for it.  Best thing I did for my weight loss journey.  I am also vegan, so it was important for me to monitor my protein intake, etc.  The upgraded version is awesome. I can actually track my vitamin and mineral intake within the food I consume!  It gives me warnings if my carbs are high, and if I reach my goals.   The list of available foods to choose from is vast so I never worry I cannot find what I have consumed.  I am a huge foodie and love to cook....the premium upgrade allows you the option of uploading a recipe and then converts it for you!  You can manually input a recipe as well.  Best app I've ever purchased.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.

Title: WONDERFUL Way to HELP loss Weight
----------------------------------------------------------
THANK YOU for a useful app!! Given the cost of various diets out there and/or personal trainers, THIS APP HAS GIVEN us a way to take back control of our HEALTH without a cost. It allows you to track EVERYTHING from food to exercise to personal notes!! Being able to display or add all NUTRITION FACTS is FANTASTIC for monitoring your intake. Even in a restaurant that doesn't have WiFi, you can STILL track everything & hit "sync" once you're in range of WiFi. It has been a wonderful COMPLEMENT with helping me track Weight Watcher Points Plus. Because of it's handiness, I have successfully lost 12 lbs in 5 weeks by eating what I would normally eat but in an APPROPRIATE portion size and I am now exercising 3 to 4 times a week. BE AWARE each individual person can add to or modify the food database from their PC/laptop so you might want to validate some of the data. [ ENHANCEMENTS Requested: (1) Display the date when the food item was last updated/added so we can verify it or modify it if needed (2) Display an extra column on the end of the Diary Reports & leave it blank so anyone can add a value -- i.e. WW points plus values (3) Allow food edits directly from the iPad.]

Title: Helpful!! For someone who hates diets
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has been so helpful for me as someone who has tried to cut down on food for a very long time and not a fan of substituting yummy food for bland diets every meal. I have struggled with my weight for years but this app is helping me because I find it to almost be a game of submitting what I eat and finding out how much more I get to eat this day. It reminds me to eat less just by making me more aware of my logging food in every day and shows me when I eat what has more or less calories even though I get full the same amount from each food. But the nice part is when I want to eat something I crave, I don't feel like I want to kill myself over guilt. I can have more than my allotted calories and so far have still stayed under the limit that would take me to maintain my weight so in essence I am still losing some weight even if I don't eat so little. I just remember to spread out my sweets day to day and I know tomorrow I will be healthy enough to eat again. I also love that it adds calories to my diet when I input exercise so I am allowed to eat when I exercise and thus it promotes all around health not feeling like I'm on a diet but just being healthier.

Title: it really works
----------------------------------------------------------
i've been using this app for about 6 weeks now. and i won't say how much weight i've gotten rid of, but i will say that it's more than i've ever lost in a similar period before. this app is very easy to use. it's very intuitive. it makes sense. the goals are clear, and the database is HUGE. i've only run across a couple of items that it didn't have, and i was able to approximate those. the "my recipes' function is especially helpful. you just put in all the ingredients for a recipe, and how many servings it is, and the app calculates the calories and the other nutritional information per serving. then you save it, and whenever you have that recipe you've got all the info. if you tend to eat the same things, you can create a meal and it will load all the information the next time you have that meal. once you lose 10 pounds it automatically recalculates your goals. i haven't had any problems with it. i don't use facebook or twitter, but the "news feed" on the home screen offers little bits of motivation even without posting them anywhere.  so all in all, i HIGHLY recommend this app to anyone who is trying to watch what they eat, and wants a simple way to do it.

Title: Free version is amazing compared to alternatives
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to love this app! It made food tracking a breeze because the database was soooo extensive! It also speeds up entry because it remembers past food pairings you have had for any meal. Also, my wife is Indonesian and I eat a lot of her countries cuisine and the data was there and recognized in this app! Other apps never had any data about her countries foods! So, with all the praise, why did I start this review with "used to"? Because now I hate this app!!! After the latest upgrade I have to race to get an entry completed because I will be switched to the App Store in a few seconds! So I'm constantly having to reopen this app just to get through recording a meal!! What used to be a real simple exercise is now a frustrating battle to get through it because every few seconds I'm being bumped over to the App Store?! What?? I know the free version has ads but come on!!!!!! This is an aggressive approach to trying to force people to switch to premium!!! Do you really need the money that bad! If this isn't fixed I'll be forced once again to try to find another app that will help with my weight loss goals that isn't trying to force me to buy, buy, buy!!!!

Title: I Recomend This To Everyone
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using this app for about a year and a half now. I have lost 98.5 lbs so far. It has been a great resource and a great help. The most important part is the food diary and once you get the hang of using it, creating some standard meals that you eat, using it can become quick and easy. It has also been a help when eating out to look ahead at what is offered at a restaurant, and make informed selections based on the nutritional information. A warning though. Since much of the information is entered by users it does contain some bad data or parts might be missing. If someone is entering data and they are only interested in calories or fat they may skip details for carbohydrates or other subsections. When in doubt look at other sources and compare. I also use it as a secondary exercise log. I maintain separate workout logs, but enter data in MyFitnessPal to keep track of calories used. I do not use the exercise calories when planning my meals. I try and stick to the daily goal as it is before the expended calories are subtracted. It is the best, easiest most comprehensive way that I have found for maintaining a daily food & exercise diary!

Title: 18 Pounds and Counting!!
----------------------------------------------------------
When I first downloaded this app three months ago I wasn't eating healthy or exercising because I wasn't fat. But I still wasn't happy with my body so I downloaded this and it has been a life changing app! I finally know what I should eat and shouldn't, how many calories, carbs, and sugars I'm supposed to have each day. It is so easy to use, much better than keeping track of calories on a piece of paper. Just scan the barcode and log it in! If you are eating out, many of the foods are already in the system. If not, just look up the nutritional info on the restaurant's website (should be required by law!) and log it in that way. This app really makes you accountable for your diet and exercise. Now if I sneak a cookie and don't log it in I feel like I'm lying to my phone haha. After almost three months of sticking to the calorie rules (mostly) and exercising on an elliptical along with lifting weights I have lost 18 pounds and a few inches!! Now I have to save up some money to buy new clothes that fit because the only ones that do used to be my skinny clothes. If used correctly, this app will help you become skinnier, healthier, and happier!

Title: I depend on my fitness pal
----------------------------------------------------------
It easily makes keeping track of what I eat , therefore keeping track of calories and nutrition contact. I have a mandatory goal to take in 70 grams of protein daily. Not only do I have a pie chart that breaks nutrition down but it also tells me instantly that this food item I just logged is high in protein or if it is high in fat, cholesterol, fiber. I love those thoughtful notifications.  If I turn my device sideways so it becomes landscape format, the app tells me more about what I eat, nutrition involved and breaks down breakfast, lunch, and dinner for me. Live this information!  It has evolved to be so much easier to use and carries a large database of foods, restaurant foods and grocery store items. Of course I love the camera use to scan barcodes. One other  thing that I've  have come to enjoy and depend on are the blogs and recipes. I log them and use them too. I love the exercise blogs as well.  This app just makes journaling my life so much easier and convenient. It also works seamlessly with my Fitbit. And that is another strong reason for using this app. I am loosing weight by following the feed back I receive from this app.

Title: The best app of its kind...
----------------------------------------------------------
I've had this app on my iPod for a whole now, but after I decided to become vegetarian, I thought it was more important to track what I was eating, especially to make sure I was getting enough nutrients, proteins, etc. Since then, I've absolutely loved using it. The database for food is really astounding, and I love being able to flip and see what I've been eating. Adding foods is easy, and adding recipes is great too. The interface is simple but aesthetically pleasing. I turned off the news feed on the home page and I love seeing all the details and graphs of what I've been eating. I also love being able to track my weight all in one graph. But what really made me review was the excellent customer service, so you could say. I emailed the company about a few tips I'd like to see added in the future. Half an hour later, I get an email from them. At first glance, I expected it to be an automated email notifying my that they had received my email and I would hear back from them ASAP. Instead, I found a personalized email with extremely helpful tips included. So, I just want to say thanks to the makers of this amazing app. It really works.

Title: Life changing
----------------------------------------------------------
I first started using this app when I began bodybuilding. I would have never gained over 15 pounds in muscle and completely changed my body if it wasn‚Äôt for myfitnesspal. A few years later, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. I had to alter my diet entirely. I had no energy to even work out for 3 months while I waited for my body to respond to the changes I made so I stopped using the app, as I only associated it with tracking my macros for bodybuilding. I also had no knowledge of how little calories the majority of my extremely clean diet consisted of, and because of that, I ended up losing 16 pounds. All those years of consistent hard work, gone...just like that. After hearing this alarming number, I immediately started using myfitnesspal again to gain my weight back. I have not only gained the weight back, I have learned so much about the new foods I am eating. I am also happy to say my health is finally turning around and I am working out again!! While my doctor was the one who saved my life, I this think myfitnesspal had an incredibly strong positive impact as well. And for that, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Title: Thrilled!
----------------------------------------------------------
I never write reviews but I'll take the time to make a first. This app is sooooo amazing! My weight has been a roller coaster my whole life. I've never been a big girl but I've always had an issue keeping weight consistent. I always gain five, lose two, gain seven, lose three, etc. I finally have an actual app on my phone that I can use to see everything I eat and to make me aware of how its adding up. It makes it so simple. You put in starting weight, age, height, etc. and then tell the app how many pounds you want to lose. It then tells you how many calories you can have per day and simply log in everything you eat and keep track of how many calories you have the rest of the day. You can also add exercise if you choose to do so. With my job I barely have time for that but I keep track of everything I eat, including alcohol if you'd like a beer or a glass of wine it adds that too! I've used this app for ten days and lost four pounds! I only want to lose ten more pounds but this is going to be my new favorite app to keep me on track. I am so thrilled with the quick results by just following the calorie counting. It's too easy!!!

Title: Best health tracking app I've tried
----------------------------------------------------------
I had already been using the mapmyfitness apps and had tried finding a way to track my diet along with exercise. Too much work with other apps. Counting calories and gaining insight into my dietary habits has been so easy with myfitnesspal. I love that I can scan a food's nutrient info by simply scanning the barcode. Most foods I eat are in the database and those that aren't are relatively easy to find. I've begun entering entire recipes which will only make tracking food intake easier as time goes on. I would like to see the app be better able to match typical serving measurements (some foods are measured by grams not cups/teaspoons  etc). I do have a good scale but I'm much more adept at estimating volume not weight. I'd also like it if the "my foods" list would populate with ALL the foods I've entered to date. It's not difficult to search for them but I feel like there may be an easier way to search based on searching my foods as I've entered them in the past days. I had some difficulty getting my other devices /apps to speak to this one but customer service was helpful and I was able to correct the issue with their help.

Title: Great app for getting to the truth
----------------------------------------------------------
I am a health coach who uses and recommends this app. It  has helped me and several clients discover underlying deficiencies or overages in their diet. One found a huge potassium and sodium imbalance that linked directly to bloating.  Potassium intake adjustments made a huge difference in her life. Another though she was doing well with simple carbs through portion control, but the sugar breakdown helped her self-correct. I eat almost entirely whole, unprocessed foods. I have found I have to enter specific names of foods like "roasted sweet potato" to find what I am looking for. If you type in salt for a recipe, it won't come up, but sea salt will.  This is a small inconvenience for the HUGE database of information available and the ability to create and store my own recipes and meals. I lost 35 lbs a couple of years ago using medi-fast. Since then I have converted to a whole food, unprocessed diet. I want to lose 10 more lbs with real food. This app is helping this 50+, post-menopausal woman to do just that. If you give it good information, you can really drill down and figure out just what is going on. Highly recommend.

Title: Love love love this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I am losing weight eating what my family and I like!  No buying expensive ingredients for recipes that no one else in the house wants, no starving myself and looking longingly at my favorite foods, no pain and no gaining weight!  Every diet I have ever been on was not realistic in the long run and as soon as I got off the diet I gained it back. I love that it adjusts my calories as I lose weight so I have never felt like I couldn't do it. I love adding when I exercise and then knowing how much more I could eat and stay on track. When I don't lose or gain a little back there is no question why, I can see clearly the number of extra calories I ate and the impact it had. I love the recipe feature and the meal feature.  I have been using it for over a year and I get so many comments about my weight loss but no one seems to believe me when I tell them how easy it is. You have to try it to believe it. And try it for at least a month. I'm telling you, you will not be sorry. I am 52, lost 40 pounds, still losing weight, it's slow but it works long term. A year of losing weight without feeling like I'm dieting what more can I say.

Title: A Must Have for Dieting!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is a must for dieting and losing weight. I keep track so much better, and the barcode is very convenient. I love that when you complete your entry at the end of the day, it says, "If every day were like today, you'd weigh ___ in 5 weeks." I love using this app with dieting. When I used to diet, I'd eat small amounts often, but not worry about the amount of calories. I found out that I was actually eating too few calories, which is why I'd give up by the second week - because I was so hungry and fatigued. My Fitness Pal does all the work for you, and lets you know how many calories you have remaining for the day. It is so convenient to always have the app with you on your phone! I also love that you can view your daily values of everything. I learned that I am good when it comes to fiber (which was a surprise), but my sodium and sugars are ridiculously high. It's fun to compare day to day, and aim for improvement with specific areas, not just the number of calories. I lost 5 pounds during my first week using this app, which was a pleasant surprise. That's a lot for me. I love this app, and highly recommend it!

Title: Tracks my calories
----------------------------------------------------------
I live this free app as it helps me to track my calories so I can work on weight loss. Without tracking, we all consume far more calories than we realize. But when I am focusing on weight loss, I track my calories with this app and I actually weigh and/or measure my food portions. This helps me to pay attention to portion sizes and to make good choices in the foods I eat. I love the scanning aspects - saves the time of looking up foods. I also like that it when I enter the shredded chicken that I add to my lunch salad, this app will list the other ingredients that I usually add to my salad. I can then tap on the ingredients I added for that day and they are added in to my meal. Again, that saves you some time. This app is very easy to use - just download it and you can start tracking. I enjoy reading the blogs and find the info presented to be helpful. I was also pleased to discover that I can import a recipe from the Internet and this app will give me the calorie and nutrient breakdown. I have not upgraded to premium as I don't think I need the added features. For the time being, this free app works great for me.

Title: Love this app
----------------------------------------------------------
With each pound I lose I appreciate this app more and more. If only I had known sooner, that something as simple as counting the calories and paying attention to the nutritional content of what I eat would be half the battle. I love the recipe feature. It allows me to make my favorite foods and know what's in them. I like the slide feature for adding the previous day's meal in a second. The meal feature is very helpful as well. I usually eat the same meal at the restaurants I frequent and having the meals saved helps me save time and frustration. The new restaurant feature seems useless to me, it never behaves for me. I also get a little upset when I have to (sometimes) wait for the day to end before my exercise is ported over from the other app and is able to be included in my calorie intake. It sends my daily info the other way just fine. I'm overall very pleased with this app. I have tried several others and this one is the best so far. So thanks My fitness pal for helping me lose 45lbs and getting me closer than I have ever been to my goal weight. I think for my 1 yr anniversary I may update to premium.

Title: The Missing Link to Success!
----------------------------------------------------------
The use of this tool has literally meant the difference between success and failure for me in my struggles with weight loss. I cannot say enough good things about it! Over the years, I've tried many diets. Of course, going ON a diet implies going OFF of it later and that almost always spells failure. This app helped me to see--in black and white--exactly how my choices affect my weight outcome. I saw that I could eat whatever I wanted as long as I kept track and stayed within my calorie range for the day. (This tool makes it so easy!) And although I felt the freedom of being able to eat whatever I wanted, it didn't take long to figure out that the healthier I ate, the more food I could have, or that the more I moved my body, the more calories I could add to my daily allotment. Before I knew it, I was automatically and willingly making healthier choices for myself which, I believe, is the ultimate goal for everyone and a good prescription for long-term success. The weight is finally coming off and I am truly grateful to the providers of this incredibly helpful tool for helping me to "get" it. THANK YOU!!!

Title: Best of its kind
----------------------------------------------------------
I was looking for a journal/diary to keep track of my food intake in a given day. After failing to update a hand written journal, I turned to the App Store. I struggled for weeks trying to find an app. After expressing my frustrating experiences with several different apps to my personal trainer, she recommended I try my fitness pal. I couldn't be happier with the product! It keeps track of my weight progress, food and caloric intake, water, and exercises. Lots of recipes are already added into the app, an if I can't find the one I need, I just title something as "homemade" ad upload the recipe myself. It's even smart enough to estimate the amount of calories I burned during a work out (I have a polar watch that gives me the exact number, but impressively my fitness pal is usually within 50 calories of what I burned). Also, it customizes a recommended caloric intake given my weight loss goals (1 lb a week). I love that my friends and I can update, share, and encourage each other to reach our goals. It's a smart, intuitive app and I'm so glad I found it. I've already lost 14 pounds since I got started!

Title: Works wonders when used correctly!
----------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôve been a MyFitnessPal user for 6 years now. I want to start by saying when I first started using it, I was using this app religiously. I managed to lose 15 pounds in 3 months. However, I was losing weight for all the wrong reasons and found myself tracking my diet and making sure I was only eating 1500 calories a day when I should have been getting 2000. As soon as I stopped using it, I kept the same weight until I went to college. Freshman 15 is a real thing and that is exactly what happened. I gained all my weight back but it wasn‚Äôt just fat, I was gaining muscle too because I found myself weightlifting regularly. 2 years later, I found myself big with a slightly higher than normal fat percentage. That is when I started using my fitness pal again. Now I use this app correctly, and have been losing a moderate and healthy amount of fat a month, by keeping track of my macronutrients and making sure everything that I eat align with my goals. This app does exactly that. Now I have gotten into a routine of logging my food. It used to be a chore, but now it‚Äôs a habit and it‚Äôs a habit I‚Äôm happy to have!

Title: Lost 47 pounds already this year
----------------------------------------------------------
Fitness pal works so well for me. It doesn't judge. It just records facts. I committed to telling it everything except the occasional milk in coffee. I am creating new habits and I didn't quit the first time I was at an unexpected party and went over by 1700 calories that day. I acknowledged that this was the first exception to my new habits and not my habit. I still lost weight that week. Yes, the two pound loss for had targeted. This week was the first week I maintained my weight since April. Every other week has been a loss. I'm totally okay with that. I still log everything. I exercise six days a week. Swim or bike or walk. I counted my 4 hours of volunteer bar tending yesterday as a two hour leisurely walk. It's all good. MyFitnessPal is my pal in this endeavor and I give it the highest rating because it is always there, consistent, and ready to record my steps along the way, be they baby steps or giant leaps of progress. My blood pressure mess are down, I'm no longer prediabetic and my liver enzymes are way down. My fatty liver is also losing weight. If you work it, it will be work for you. üòç

Title: Great App - Try it, it truly is Amazing.
----------------------------------------------------------
If you want to lose or just maintain weight this is the app. Graphs and charts are very good. The best thing about this app is the food database. It is so easy to use. You will find yourself wanting to use this app all the time. I use it to the point where people think I am addicted. Don't judge me until you've tried it yourself. I will put in breakfast and lunch to get a handle on how many calories I have left for dinner and snacks. If I know I am going out to eat I will arrange my early meals to compensate. There is a lot of fast food in the database so you can even get a good estimate of how many calories you will need to save for that night on the town without blowing your diet. You would be surprised at how many calories are in some items. On the flip side you will find a lot of low calorie stuff so that you can eat a ton of food and still not blow your diet. There are so many features to this free app that you will have to try for yourself since it would take to much time to explain here. One of the best apps that I have found. You have got to try it if you are serious about your health.

Title: Lost more than 50 lbs...
----------------------------------------------------------
Using this app.  Of course, I exercised and made sure to follow the app's guidelines on how many calories I should eat to obtain my goal.  I found tracking ever single thing I ate was hugely beneficial. I was surprised at how many calories I was actually consuming and could remove items that didn't seem "worth" it to me.  They could improve their list of items able to scan to include grocery store meat and deli but that's really my only criticism.  If I do a manual search, I can find the item.  Since I eat pretty much the same items every week (maybe weekends are a bit more exciting), I found that once my key foods were in, I could easily choose them over and over.  If you want to track your calories, then this is a fabulous app to make that an easier process.  I've used it for years and have no plans to change that.  Even though I've lost the weight I wanted to lose, I still use to stay on track.  I also like looking at the nutrition feature to see where my vitamin intake may be lacking.  There aren't a whole lot to track in the free version, but it's enough.  Good luck with your journey üëç

Title: Miracle tool!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Ok, so this app doesn't perform miracles. It's not supernatural, but it's just this side of miraculous for me. I had always considered myself health conscious and felt I ate a balanced, appropriate diet. But over the last year I had gained over 20lbsüòë I couldn't understand what I was doing wrong. After so much frustration, I downloaded this app and shocked would be an understatement for what I felt when I saw how terribly I was eating and how much. I had no idea how malnourished I was yet how excessive my calorie intake was, let alone how little activity I was doing compared to what I needed. This app has helped me make smarter, healthier choices about what I eat, how much and the amount of exercise I do. I love that I can simply scan a barcode or import a recipe from online to add something to my food diary. It tracks my steps and I can sync it with many other apps and devices to get a more accurate picture of my health. I've lost over 6lbs since I started using this app a little over a month ago, but I'm not starving or feeling deprived. I feel happy, healthy and satisfiedüòÄ

Title: I freaking love this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I have only had this app for around 2 hours and I am already I love with it. I am 13 years old, I weigh 201 pounds, and I am super insecure about my body. This app has so many options and within 1 hour I already got to do everything that I planned on doing. This app lets you lose weight, gain weight, keep a calorie count, make homemade workouts, let you talk to others about each of your successes and how you are personally doing. My favorite part about this app is that you have the choice to pay for more options, and if you don‚Äôt want to do that you can just stay to the free one which is just as good. I have been trying to loose weight for 4 years now and I have struggled with my weight since I was born. And over the years I have seen many doctors, been on many diets, played all the sports, tried all the apps, and never once have I seen something that I can‚Äôt wait to do/use everyday. I will use this app for one month and update you all in one month on my progress. Thank you for taking the time to read this and if you get this app I hope that you have some great success. BYEE

Title: Why use anything else?
----------------------------------------------------------
I am already in decent shape. I eat good foods, and am vegetarian. I exercise 4+ times a week and always try to minimize snacking (try being the keyword). I work 50+ hours a week and eating extremely healthy during the day, assumed my calories weren't building too much. Boy was I wrong! Since getting the FitnessPal app, I have lost almost 5 pounds in the first month! I am 5'4 and was 126 pounds, so not overweight. There are a few trouble spots I'd like to slim, tone, and tighten though. I never realized until after I downloaded the app, how much I was eating and those small snacks were hurting me! I always wondered if I just had an issue losing weight but it wasn't my body, it was my mouth! The app has everything. Most foods you can look up, you can scan bar codes, track every gram of protein, carbs, ect. You can also see where you stand weekly. I am so excited to see where I'll be in another month! And I have already recommended the app to several people, being overjoyed with my results! You should definitely try it before making any final decisions. You will fall in LOVE!

Title: Better than Expected
----------------------------------------------------------
I had seen this app before but wasn't really sure if I wanted to use it. I'm not the type to track my food intake since I figured it would be a pain to figure out the nutrition value of food and since I do a lot of home creation cooking, I didn't want to measure out each ingredient, etc. I wasn't in a hurry to lose weight, was going to do it naturally with healthier eating.  Downloaded the app anyways just to try out. Turns out it's a very good motivator. There is a lot of food information in it already with different brands, so you just need to search for the food and put in the serving you had. For home creations, I do an estimate by putting in the various ingredients and the nutrition info is already there. This app has helped me be more aware of what I eat daily and make better eating choices. The only thing is it does not take into account weight exercises for calories (or I don't know how to use it right). Premium would seem like a good addition but it's way to expensive. If it's a one time fee, I may consider it but it's 9.99 per month or 60 for whole year.

Title: Myfitnesspal for life
----------------------------------------------------------
I have used myfitnesspal on and off for a number of years now. More consistently over the last 3 months and I can say accountability and immediate feedback is what has made the world of difference in producing the results I've achieved. At the premium level the ability to analyze macros is just as comparable to any other app on the market. I particularly like the computation at the end of the day that allows you to see where your weight would be in 5 weeks. There is a huge database of foods including restaurants that helps make the task of logging meals seamless. Plus I enjoy the instant feedback of looking up the calories of a meal in a restaurant and deciding whether it's worth it or not ingesting all those calories! It helps me plan my workouts or plan intermittent fasting. Overall using this app has made me feel more empowered with the food and activity choices I make. This has become a way of life for me and has encouraged more mindful eating. I highly recommend myfitnesspal to my patients and clients who are committed to making long term lifestyle changes.

Title: Very convenient and effective!
----------------------------------------------------------
I started using this app as part of my lifestyle change to lose 100 lbs. I have used this in conjunction with other things such as my Garmin. It is very convenient to be able to sync this with my Garmin so I don‚Äôt have to add my activities or calories burned. I love that I‚Äôm able to scan the things I eat and easily add things that do not have a barcode to scan, a must for this single (and very busy) mom of 4! Being able to add my own meal recipes has been wonderful as well; recipes that‚Äôs have been passed down from family (Mexican dishes) which have always been hard to keep track of is no longer a problem. This app, I‚Äôm certain, has allowed me to enjoy the foods I want and be mindful of my consumptions and portion sizes. It really has helped put a perspective on my own habits and also had helped me identify how my body gains and looses weight, which I feel is different for everyone and is imperative when trying to lose weight. I lost 75 lbs just by adding this app and of coarse increasing my activity levels. A++ and a 5 star rating from me! Great job developers!

Title: Phenomenal!
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is the best, WAY better than Wt Watchers: it's free, and there is not one food that's not listed - seems like the lists are endless. The fact that you can input weight every day & see a run chart of the trends is great. Plus, you can change the daily calorie limit which is important - great not just to be boxed in to what someone else thinks is the right calorie amount for me. Also, seeing the nutrition breakdown is amazingly helpful: able to keep track of sodium, carbs, sugar, fiber, protein, etc. They do need to add Zumba to the exercises. There should be a way to add some value for pedometer daily steps, and then give a run chart - even just to track over time (if you're trying to go from, say, 10,000 steps per day to 15,000.) It's definitely not just a Fitness App. (It should be called My Better Health Pal because good nutrition, weight loss, and improved fitness are all key, for me anyway.)  To summarize: I love it - I'm telling everybody - it's amazing & it's FREE, what?!? One of the best apps I've ever used. Exactly what I wanted. Thank you --

Title: SAY GOOD BYE TO MY LAST 20 LBS.
----------------------------------------------------------
I have never seen anything better. It has ALL kinds of food, not just general American food. Very diverse. I was using LooseIt for a year, and I have been using this app for 3 days. BIG difference! With LooseIt, I lost 10 lbs in a year, decrease my percentage body fat from 32 to 25%. My goal is to loose another 20 lbs and decrease my percentage body fat from 25 to 16%. With this app. I can already see my end results. It has a lot more food choices, nutritional value, accurate, and more exercise choices. Logging my food was EFFORTLESS. I give up monitoring my intake about 6 months ago  because the hassle of logging in my food. I no longer have to look for nutritional value and calorie count on food packages. I can't believe that such an app. like this one is free. I would pay $10 for it. $10 to loose 20 lbs, yep I would do so in a heart beat. With an app like this makes weight lose easy. I'm actually very motivated to start on the right track again. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. You only got the lbs to loose, nothing else :-) good luck in your journey to better health.

Title: Love
----------------------------------------------------------
This app has changed my life. It has led me to make different decisions when it comes to food. After a week of using it, I noticed changes in my body and my overall well being. Not only was I able to look back on my day-to-day eating and realize what I could have left out of my meals, but it motivated me to hop on the elliptical or go for a run to earn back my calories. I am a visual person; seeing everything laid out for me is so helpful. Almost every food or drink, from any restaurant included, is searchable through this app. The barcode search is really helpful, as well. I learned that I was consuming way too much sugar every day, and that I wasn't getting enough fiber in my diet. I have completely changed the way that I view food. And, yes, my profile is private. Not even the friends that I connect with can view my weight or food intake. You can connect with friends to motivate each other. That's it. Anyway, I recommend this app to anyone who is looking for education on what they're eating and motivation to maintain or lose weight. It's a wonderful app!

Title: Such a valuable app, and I mean even the free version
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app. It is a little tedious to have to track all my food, but it has been so worth it. The app is easy to use. Takes a minute to get to know how everything works and all the possibilities, but really quite simple to use. I have now used it for several years, on and off. This time around, I have found it makes me so much more conscious of the snacking I have been justifying. I now realize just how many extra calories those stupid little snacks, and the little bit of soda, or the mini-chocolates actually contribute to my daily intake. Way more calories than they are worth in nutrition. Accordingly, I have REDUCED my decadent indulgences, and am already losing weight! Those marketing masters, making mini-chocolates so you think, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just little. It can be many calories!‚Äù The problem is those mini‚Äôs are just as addicting as the full-sized candy bars. So...I can‚Äôt just eat one. This app has put the truth in my face. It is now up to me to decide whether those indulgences are worth spending that many calories on. I am getting stronger and stronger!

Title: Top-notch!
----------------------------------------------------------
I'll qualify this by saying this us the first App review i have ever taken the time to write. Being an extremely busy middle-aged corporate executive Mom of a special needs child, as well as battling lupus, weight management is only one aspect I need to be continually mindful of. After using Weight Watchers online program religiously for a year and not only stalling out, but feeling continually exhausted trying to stay under my daily allotted points, I was feeling very frustrated. I stumbled across your App by accident and decided to give it a shot. I LOVE THIS APP! Not only am I able to track calories and activity, I can scan packaged foods with ease, sync with fitness apps to reduce the amount of time logging activity, and most importantly, view daily reports of essential nutrient intake and be notified when I fall short of calcium, potassium and other crucial nutrients. I love the fact this App is mindful of holistic health, not simply "staying under my points" and achieving a goal weight. I look forward with excitement to ongoing updates to this App!

Title: MyFitnessPal rocks!
----------------------------------------------------------
I LOVE this app!  I have been struggling with my weight for years, trying with the best of intentions to get rid of it, counting calories, keeping track of fat, protein, and sugar grams...... MyFitnessPal does all of that for me. If I have a Slim Fast or Nutrisystem meal, I just scan the barcode into MFP and all the nutrition info is saved for me. If I eat 3 Taco Bell tacos for dinner, I just search MFP for Taco Bell and a list of all their foods pops up.  I pick the right one, enter the number of servings, and MFP tracks all that info. At the end of the day, MFP calculates your total caloric & nutritional intake and tells you what you can expect to weigh in 5 weeks.  You can enter your weight-loss goal, and it will determine your optimal daily caloric intake. I linked my Fitbit to MFP, and my Fitbit tells MFP how many calories I have burned  every day, and based on that info, MFP will tell me whether I should eat fewer or greater calories to reach my goal.  I can do all of this at work, at home, or on the middle of running errands, just using my phone!

Title: Second time round
----------------------------------------------------------
This is the second time I have used this app the 1st time was 4 years ago I had reached my goal and bam I  blew a disk in my back and had to have surgery (no more gym)and gained all the weight back sitting on the couch, I Am  finally back on track and my first week I've lost 11/2 lbs. the beauty of this app is you can put your daily meals down day by day and you know exactly how many calories your taking in for that day. Once you are aware what your putting in your mouth you'll think twice about reaching for those chips. I love this app because it will tell you what you would weigh in 5 weeks, for instance I need to lose 12 lbs my starting weight is 177lbs the app tells me if I keep consuming 1200 calories per day I would weigh 165lbs, so if that's  not encouragement I don't know what is! And a bonus is it counts my steps when I go to the gym so I can earn extra calories to consume usually 125cal. I highly recommend this app  save your money on pills and gimmicks the only way to lose is to know calorie content in your food. Good luck YOU CAN DO IT!

Title: This app could change your life.
----------------------------------------------------------
Highly recommend. Extremely useful tool. You'll learn a lot about your body with this app. Helped me lose 40 pounds. What the app does is teach you how much you eat (we think we know roughly but we don't- for instance how much protein and fat you consume in a day- very hard to know without tracking). It takes a ton of protein to build muscle, like 6x what people normally eat, so if your trying to change your body you gotta know what macros you're consuming. Also, if you experience bloating or other things, the app helps you identify what foods are a trigger. Also what foods make you feel excellent. I learned for instance on days I eat quinoa I generally eat well all day and feel great. The app is easy to use and has a scanner which scans the barcode on food items that are packaged. It also has a huge database so if you go to a chain restaurant of any sort its meals are on on here most likely. You can save "meals" that you commonly eat- lots of shortcuts on the app, worth learning them to make the input time minimal maybe 5 minutes a day total.

Title: Comprehensive nutrition calculator.
----------------------------------------------------------
This is my favorite nutrition calculator so far! I also tried the Livestrong My Plate, but its not as thorough on evaluating all the nutrition facts of your food and adding them up. I like to know if I can actually get enough vitamins through my food as well or if I need to supplement.  My Fitness Pal has a huge data base; comprehensive nutritional calculations including main vitamins, not just calories, fat, carbs, and protein counts; barcode scanner for quickly finding packaged food.  If you eat a lot of the same foods, it becomes faster and easier to track over time. I like this waayyy more then "dieting," because I don't completely restrict myself. Instead I stick better to moderation and never feel deprived. I'm more motivated to get my workouts in, so I have more flexibility to eat more if I want. I've already seen results in 1.5 week of 2 lbs lost and I feel great. I didn't realize how much I was over eating until now. I calculate now and I never feel deprived, instead I'm more knowledgable of my nutrition and feel more balanced. :)

Title: Best Fitness/Nutrition Tracker
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been using this for a while now, and the more I figure out the better it gets. I've never seen such an extensive food list. It's really easy to find and add foods and activity, link to a fitness tracker, and choose menu items from a huge number of restaurants based on your location.  The accuracy for well-known chains seems really good. There are also many local and one of a kind restaurants, but I have questions sometimes about accuracy on those menu items. For instance, I ordered a hamburger yesterday because it supposedly had under 400 calories but it tasted like at least twice that (yum). So I added the ingredients on my own for a more realistic total.  I have no patience with journaling my every little morsel, so it has to be fast and efficient for me to keep with it. It took me a few false starts over a few months, but now that I have it mostly figured out, I've been at it for more than a week straight, which is sort of a minor miracle for me. It's fast enough that I may actually have the patience to keep it up. It's impressive.

Title: Cool features!
----------------------------------------------------------
I previously had the LiveStrong app, but it's gone downhill, at least on the desktop version. Many of my friends use MyFitnessPal so I thought I'd try it out. I love the barcode scanner, that thing is SUPER handy! I like that I can set reminders to log my meal if I haven't done it by a certain time. I love that I get a "5 day streak" acknowledgement (let's face it, I need every carrot I can get). And that it remembers my recent food or meals--makes it easy when I eat the same things all the time. The only things I wish were different are: (1) I wish I could see ALL my recent foods, not just the ones from a particular category. Sometimes I have something for dinner, and then the leftovers for lunch. When I go to log my lunch, it shows me recent lunch foods, but not dinner foods. And then (2) on the desktop version (which I use at work), when browsing for a food, it doesn't list the calories at the first level of browsing, you have to drill down into the listing to find out. I wish the calories were listed next to the food, like in the app.

Title: Oh my goodness, I LOVE My Fitness Pal!
----------------------------------------------------------
I've never been someone that counted calories or really cared too much about my weight.. And, when I did care, I was never honest about it.. So dumb! I've been gaining lots if weight lately, so I had to do something! This app is soooo easy and makes it so visual that's it's all simple math... If I eat more (adds calories), I need to do some exercise (subtract calories). Makes it so easy to stay under my required calories every day.   They have every food and I love scanning foods! My favorite part is after I complete the entry for the day, it tells me, if every day were like today, how much I'm likely to weigh in five weeks! That is sooooo encouraging (and a reality check for the day I pigged out!). I also love that I can see all the nutritional information.. I knew I was low on Iron, but seeing It right in front of me encouraged me to take an Iron supplement every day! I also see that I need more fiber and potassium..This app seriously changed the way I view food, how I eat, exercise and I'm watching the weight drop off! It's so cool!

Title: Scan is my fav feature
----------------------------------------------------------
I love this app! My fav feature is the scanning. Also the database is fairly broad. I just went DF & GF & many of the items are in the database...love how easy it is!!! I also like that you can create recipes...awesome! My husband & I can share meal content & that's a big bonus!!! The ability to have friends & family encourage you along they way by sharing the info/progress of your choice is fun! The last feature I LOVE is that it syncs to my fitbit flex...SO awesome! With fitness pal & fitbit working together I can keep track of calorie intake & calories burned easily. In 3 weeks I have lost nearly 5 lbs & I don't feel like I'm starving. My Fitness Pal is helping me plan & make better choices. If I eat a little too many calories I just take another walk & I'm good to go! I have tried My Net Diary & I wanted to toss my phone out the window when I couldn't get the scanner to work barely at all. Grrrr! Scanned same item in same condition with ease using My Fitness Pal! What more can I say...I love it! Thanks for making such a cool app!

Title: Lost 40 lbs with this
----------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to find a tool to help me lose weight with walking that can help me long term. I was a personal trainer before I became ill and the meds made me gain weight. After a talk with my doctor he advised me to give this app a try. My concern with diets was they weren't really preparing me once I got to my ideal weight to maintain it. This app got me in the habit of weighing and measuring my portions. I found out I had celiac disease so this app helped me go on a higher protein, low carb and low sugar diet. I started with switching one bad food for a healthier option. Started walking at the mall and each month added a lap. I dropped 40 lbs and 5 inches on my waist. Now with the app I am increasing my protein intake and trying to gain muscle. The measuring and weighing is an adjustment but so easy after. Now when I go to the butcher I just weigh all my meats in 8 ounces and pop them in the freezer. After I eat I take out the next meal, season it, and marinade for next night. Plus the fitness blog and recipes you receive are awesome.

Title: Life Changing App
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is easy to use.  The barcode scanning feature is awesome....their database has pretty much everything.....unlike the WW app I previously tried.  This app lets you put in your stat's and goals and then calculates your daily calories/nutritional requirements. After you scan each your foods and tell it how many servings you ate it  it will deduct it from your daily total so you know how many calories you have left for the day. Also as you enter exercise it adds calories to your daily allowence!  Please use the full one line website of My Fitness Pal also because it is amazing!   The community forum is jam packed with information about every diet/exercise question you could possibly have, there are tons of before and after pics and it is a way to find people with similar goals and friend them.  You will not believe how supportive the other users are.  Another great thing about this app is it synchs with other apps such as digifit.  This has been the easiest diet I've ever been on.  It has been a life changing experience for me!

Title: Great App!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I LOVE myfitnesspal, it's the app I use most often!! I find it to be far superior to the other calorie tracking apps I've tried. I love that it gives you list, graph & pie chart viewing options to stay on top of both daily & weekly statistics. I love how the nutritional intake listing also tracks potassium, vitamins a & c, calcium & iron intakes. The fact that you can also keep careful watch over the types of fats you are consuming (fats, sat fats, poly/monounsaturated & trans fats) is wonderful! The only thing I'd change is the format of the added foods list... everything is placed in no particular order, so searching for foods becomes tedious; creating alphabetical listings would simplify things. But I love the multi-add feature, it's a true time saver. Plus, this app allows you to track water intake, which is an excellent feature to have! Lazy as I am, I haven't taken advantage of the exercise tracking feature yet, though I do intend to do so very soon, that listing seems very comprehensive. Thumbs up on an awesome app!!!

Title: Love it
----------------------------------------------------------
Now that I'm diligently tracking my calories for weight loss, this app is a must have. It syncs with my Fitbit to track my steps and exercise and automatically adjusts my calories. It also adjusts my calorie goal (lower) when I update my weight. Amazing how entering everything you eat really makes you realize how crappy some food is (mostly fast/prepared food). Not that I didn't know that already but there is something about seeing it on screen that helps me make much better food choices. I love that I can scan barcodes on packaged food instead of having to enter all the nutritional data. Plus, I cook a lot so the ability to add recipes (manually or from the web) is really helpful. The web recipe addition component could use a little fine tuning because it sometimes messes up the ingredients, but I don't know how possible that is considering all the different formatting on the web. It's usually a pretty simple fix so that's a minor quibble for me...love this app and plan on using it throughout my weight loss journey and beyond.

Title: Even I can use this Easy App
----------------------------------------------------------
I found my mojo again with the help of My Fitness Pal app.  I am 56 yo and was not exercising, paying attention to my nutrition  or thinking about my health  in any way until something clicked inside of me just before the New Year.  My DTR had been trying to get me to the Rec ctr for months but I resisted. She also kept trying to get me to use the My Fitness Pal app.  But I also resisted as I am not tech savvy.  I am happy to say that since the first of the year I am once again exercising 5 times a week and logging my calories. I focus on the fiber content. I have changed my mind about a food selection on numerous occasions after viewing the calorie counts in the app. Since Jan 4, 2015 I have lost 32 lb and can feel my strength increasing.  My clothes are getting too loose to cont to wear. As I mentioned above, I am not tech savvy so was surprised that I had no difficulty using this app after a brief tutorial from my dtr. It truly helps me stay on track with my nutrition and weight loss goals. Thank you for this great app!

Title: A great tool for gains
----------------------------------------------------------
I used to have this mentality that if I ate as frequently as I could, and anything I could find, that I would consume my required amount of protein. My mentality was, I am trying to bulk up so excess calories wouldn't hurt.  Well, one day I decided to keep track of everything I was eating so I downloaded this app. I found myself struggling to even come near my desired intake of protein! It too me almost a full week to get it right and be able to consume the right about of meats and dairy products to reach my goals at the end of the day! My diet has changed drastically, I went from eating fatty foods to lean meats and kidney beans and lentils (which have a good amount of protein) not only that but I've also been able to keep track of my carbs and fats as well which is very important to making gains. In the time that I've been using this app, I have hardly changed my workout routines, only my diet and  but I am making gains. I totally recommend this to anyone trying to get in the right amount of macronutrients day by day:)

Title: Very easy to customize
----------------------------------------------------------
I was thankful to find I could enter a recipe I made up and come up with nutritional value. This gives freedom to the user to eat realistic meals. Also it can pull up nutritional values for chain restaurants. Cracker Barrel Panda Express you name it. This app is very personal. It knows foods I buy at world market that seem a bit esoteric. It knows which bottle of coconut oil from the granola grocer lol out of many varieties. It does the same thing to calculate calories burned. I swim. It asked what stroke... What intensity, or treading water at what intensity. Just flop around in the water it figures the calories for that too enter how many minutes and BOOM!!! It calculates for you. I double check on other calculators and the calculations are accurate. U can see minerals and vitamins and fats you are high or low in and see your stats in different visual charts. I can see my nutrition over the past week and caloric intake. I can chart my weight and chat w friends if I want to encourage them. Best program I have found.

Title: so far so good
----------------------------------------------------------
So far this app's been really helpful. Once I got into a habit of doing it, I don't forget about typing in entries. It also helps me realize just how much food I have been actually consuming each day. I'm not particularly heavy, sitting around the middle zone of the 'normal weight' BMI zone. But I'm also not tall, and being 'average weight' (especially in American standards, which is very generous in what it counts as average) at the height of 5'3" isn't really the ideal figure I'd like. I want to shed the last few pounds that people have told me are the hardest to lose, and this app helps me keep track. It also makes you feel pretty good every time you enter in your exercise amount and watch your calorie allowance for the day go up. I especially love the nutritional breakdown, because I'm also trying to be healthier in what I eat in general. After watching it for a few days I realized I was almost always very low in vitamin A and calcium, so I am now eating to replenish them. Overall, smooth-running and helpful app.

Title: Love it
----------------------------------------------------------
I've been trying to lose weight for many years. 2010 was my first successful attempt for I lost 70lbs by the next year. Of course life struggles took over and I gained back all the weight I lost. Bad I know. The good this is it took me two years to gain it all back. So a friend of mine suggested that I give up on trend diets and just try counting calories. Even though when I lost the 70lbs I was unintentionally counting calories. I just couldn't stand it. At first when I lost the 70lbs it was more so like weighing my food vs. counting but in the end it all resulted the same way. I've tried over and over to drop the weight again but I just get so hungry. So I said what the heck and took my friends advice and joined her on MFP. Not exactly sure the amount of weight I've lost with this app because I have been on the scale prior to using.  But I'm certain at least 5 lbs. I find it easy to just enter what I've eaten and what activities ive completed. My favorite part is the estimate weight in 5weeks portion of the app.

Title: Big Loser!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I sat in a workshop that taught me about this APP on March 17, 2017! I was 221 pounds that day. I'd stand in the kitchen and shovel down a half bag of Doritos for snacks midday and still Run 5K's at moderate paces but never lose weight! Until I was informed of this wonderful MFP app! It really helps keep track of what you are eating to regulate your daily calories! 100 straight days I've been faithfully entering every thing I've eaten and still running 5K's. I eat the exact same things as before, but thanks to MFP, I eat smaller portions since I record it and have to see that I'm over my calorie budget!! It works! If someone considers it a nuisance it is strictly because they are lazy! There are several great features like copying meals, millions of already scanned labels, and the fact that it'll take your exercises directly from mapmyrun so you don't have to add it twice! Excellent app! And 3.5 months later, I'm down to 198.4 pounds!! It's addicting but what isn't?! Thanks MFP for helping me lose over 20 pounds!

Title: Easy to use and lose!
----------------------------------------------------------
The only way I lose weight is when I‚Äôm counting all my calories. With this app on my phone, I can always do that. I set my goal of 2 lbs loss per week, and I love the graph that displays showing my progress each time I enter a new weight. The only thing I would ask the developer to improve is the recipe section, where you can add some recipe you eat all the time, such as a salad with 5 or 6 ingredients. This makes it much easier to add that same recipe to your food intake another time. But today I tried to enter my breakfast and it kept trying to leave the recipe page as I entered ingredients - Kodiak Buttermilk Cakes, skim milk, 1 egg. When I finally finished it, it had the correct calorie count, but it said I ate 14 g of protein, and that‚Äôs just for the Kodiak mix. The total protein should have been 21 g. But overall this app seems to enter accurate info (outside of the recipe function), and I find it extremely useful for calorie counting, weight loss, and keeping track of protein intake when I‚Äôm working out.

Title: Losing Weight Will Never Be Easy But...
----------------------------------------------------------
My fitness pal has made it possible. I started my process using a different app, which was also pretty good. I switched to my fitness pal at the request of a friend who is also dieting, when she suggested that we be each other's accountability partners. That was the feature that the other app did not have.  This app makes it easy to record everything I put in my mouth, because in nearly 70 days of tracking I haven't managed to come up with anything that wasn't in its database. And knowing someone else can see what I eat every day motivates me to try to make better choices. The best part though is that it tracks all of the nutrition facts about the things that I eat. This allows me to recognize the weak areas of my diet and to focus on the things that I need to improve. I decided to try a low-carb diet, and this app has made it possible to do that without neglecting important nutrients. I've lost nearly 60 pounds. I still have a long way to go, but I couldn't be happier with my experience with this program.

Title: Irreplaceable Even After Weightloss
----------------------------------------------------------
Entering year 50, I vowed to stop the constant up and down of 10 pounds in either direction and stabilize at a healthy weight and fitness level. So I set my goal, one I thought reasonable and attainable given the coaching and recommendations of Myfitnesspal. One year later and I have moved past that first goal three different times. I weigh what I did in college, I'm stronger than I was then, and my weight varies by, at max, two pounds a weigh in. During the work week, I log everything on Myfitnesspal and sync it with my Apple Watch activity. On the weekends, I let up a little (or a lot). I've run four-milers and a 15k, and I'm signed up for a half-marathon in three months. It's the accountability Myfitnesspal provides that makes this simple. I honestly feel better than I EVER have. It's the maturity of "middle" age combined with the fitness level of my youth. Never believed it could happen. Sign up, sign in every day, log everything (so easy with the database Myfitnesspal provides) and watch it happen.

Title: Easier to stay within budget
----------------------------------------------------------
Dieting is hard enough. This App really helps you stay within budget. I started counting calories using Lose It App, which I learned about on Dr Oz by one of his guests that said the App really helped her lose weight counting calories. I used it for months then started My Fitness Pal at same time. I noticed when I'd record weight loss, Lose It deducts your Budget as you lose. My FP does not. Both started me at 1,200 cal's/daily for my age, height, weight & goal. LI App has me down to 1,152, which is under what I googled needing per day. When I stay within LI Budget then the My FP App tells me I'm not eating enough cal's & my body thinks its starving. What I've read (online) is that not eating enough cal's/daily the body goes into starvation mode & begins feeding on muscle. So, I like this App best. Plus it gives so many brands & restaurants for cal search it makes it easier to stay within my 1,200 and not get discouraged with dieting. Thanks My Fitness Pal. I'm losing (16lbs so far) & not frustrated!

Title: Lose weight, Be healthy
----------------------------------------------------------
Tracking EVERYTHING I eat/snack. Achieved my goal of losing 10 pounds & did it in 6 weeks without a"crash" diet. Used it with my MapMyWalk app to consume just the right foods in the right amounts, even gaining energy in the process & learning new healthier & surprisingly delicious foods. The ability to scan bar codes off packaged foods is great. The nutritional database for foods is very extensive, including menu items at chain restaurants. In 3 months of using it for all foods, I have rarely had to use another reference. The interface is so easy to use that, even after achieving my weight loss goal, I am motivated to use it to select my foods for optimum nutrition. I'm 69 years old & combined with my daily one hour of moderate exercise, mainly walking at a 17-minute pace, I feel better than I have since I was intensely active at age 19! This app (free, not "pro" version) when combined with the Azumio physical activity apps on my iPhone & strong personal commitment have vastly improved my health.

Title: Lost 34 lbs. in 99 days! Love this app!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am a 58-year-old male, and have been overweight for most of my adult life. Seems like all diets work for weight loss, but none are sustainable unless there is a lifetime diet change. After I bought my first smartphone, my daughter suggested the Fitness Pal app. She had lost 50 lbs. in 6 months using it. I decided to give it a try. I had never had the desire to count calories before, but the smartphone app made it easy...kind of feels like a game to me. Keeping a food diary on fitness pal has taught me to eat better while being satisfied with what I eat. By logging my food intake, I have a low desire for high calorie and high carb foods. Never would have thought that I could get my sweet tooth under control! The app is free, so give it a try! I have lost 34 lbs. in 99 days, and think I finally found a sustainable way to lose weight that I will be able to keep off permanently. I can even track my gym workouts on it. My daughter is my fitness pal, and "likes" my fitness pal progress notifications.

Title: Average Joe-No-Diet Guy Review
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm 40+. Diet? Never in my life. Exercise? Meh‚Ä¶Then I downloaded this app for the heck of it, set up my account with a semi-attainable goal weight, and now I'm hooked. I view food differently now. Calories were just scribbles on the packaging before I got this app. Now I count them and cherish them like they are gold. This is a game for me now trying to stay in my calorie allowance for the day. If I go over, I hop on the exercise bike to burn down my numbers. I view food in a whole new light now. I have changed long habits and made better choices. "Knowledge is power" and this app provides just that. The food database is HUGE. The ease of input is welcome. Calories is just one aspect, then you try to stick to your numbers for nutrition levels‚Ä¶now thats a game!! You try to get 100% of your daily allowance of iron and see how hard it is. Love it, great app. And 6 pounds lighter in a week and a half, I can't argue with it effectiveness. But just like anything, you have to want to do it. Great app.

Title: Great tracker!
----------------------------------------------------------
I am a lifetime member of Weight Watcher's, but now that I have two young kids, it is hard to get to meetings.  I also used Spark People online as a food and exercise tracking device.  I just got an iPad and couldn't decide if I should pay to be able to track with the Weight Watcher's mobile app.  I read the reviews and decided to try this for a few weeks for free and then get Weight Watcher's if I didn't like this.  This is the best online tracker I have ever used.  It is so easy to learn and user-friendly.  I like it much better than paper for tracking.  I can also instantly add to my diary from my iPhone or iPad, which means I will be more likely to use it when I'm out at restaurants.  I highly recommend this app and it was easy to give it 5 stars b/c it does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Also, I believe there are more food items to choose from in this app than on Spark People's online program, which saves me a ton of time b/c I haven't had to enter much nutritional information myself.

Title: 5 stars across the board!
----------------------------------------------------------
I cannot believe this app is free. I have tried tons of calorie counting apps from my blackberry days and they pale in comparison. They were never as complete and I'd give up. This app has everything!  I have only been using it since the start of the new year but I am already losing weight. The barcode scanner is awesome. The weekly tallies and charts are unbelievable and extremely helpful! I can see this helping me lose weight. It keeps me honest and I am much more aware of the calories in the food I have been eating. This app came highly recommended and the friends were right!  I love how complete the exercise list is. The only improvement I'd suggest is having more foods in the database that are not brand foods but accurate accounts of food items by themselves. Sometimes I'm wondering where the people entering the items got their info but if you're intelligent enough to discern the correct from the incorrect, you will be fine. Thank you for the most amazing app ever! I will use it every day!

Title: Better than Tap an Track
----------------------------------------------------------
I'm a runner. Couldn't Lose those last 25 pounds to get lean enough to run Marathons. (i lost from 240 to 210 on my own by stopping sugar and junk food and reinventing myself as a runner over the last year and a half. So I  downloaded this app. Amazingly easy to follow. Very eye opening in terms of finding out why, even though I am now a health food nut, I couldn't lose those last 25 to get running lean. Who knew salad dressing was packed with calories? Or that 4 cups of skim milk has 400 calories? Or that a tablespoon of peanut butter has over a hundred? All that adds up quick. I started using this app four weeks ago and I've lost 5 pounds. (I've got it set for a pound a week) I'm already feeling the lighter on my feet running. I figured last week, "Hey Tap and Tracks paid app must be even better" so I got it too. It's not as good as this one. Tap and track doesn't have foods like "Zoi Greek Yogurt." My fitness Pal does. You guys are great offering this free. It's worth 20 bucks. Thanks alot.

Title: Great app!
----------------------------------------------------------
Better than other calorie counters I've tried. Uses your data to help you work toward a goal. Very easy to use and provides a great breakdown of your day and progress over time. I love how it tells you, "if everyday were like today you would weigh x in 5 weeks." Has every food imaginable in its database, so you can usually find exactly what you ate, or at worst something very similar. You can easily transfer things from previous days onto today with the multi-add feature. You can input your exercise, which is so great. I use a different app to track that and find MyFitnessPal over-estimates my calories burned, but it lets you change that so easily it's not a problem. It lets you adjust everything, from a serving size to calories per serving, and lets you create your own food entry. The social feature is nice, letting you give and receive encouragement and ideas. Even if you don't use it every single day, it really raises your awareness about what you're eating so you can make better choices.

Title: Great App
----------------------------------------------------------
I have never really attempted to lose weight and get in good physical shape before, because I thought it would really be a pain. However, this app is making diet and exercise very doable. I am able to scan food packages even in the dark (with iPhone camera) and adjust portion sizes. If I decide to splurge on food, it tracks my exercise so that I know what I have to do to burn off the extra calories. The food search via the Web comes in handy when I am at restaurants. I also like the pie charts so that I can see my balance of carbs, fat, and protein every day. This helps me to make better food choices. Of course all of the tools to chart progress and the online videos are also very helpful.  I have done so well using this app, that my wife (who has always been skinny!!) started using the App just to track her nutritional balance and reduce cholesterol. This is probably the best and most useful App I have, and the most positive review I have written. Well done, and thanks for the free App!!!

Title: Best app I've ever had
----------------------------------------------------------
I started trying to lose weight in January of 2012 and am just now getting it right with this app. For the last 10 days I have been religiously logging each day and couldn't feel more motivated! I've had gastric bypass surgery and the one thing I've learned the hard way is the only right way to losing weight is watching what you eat and exercise and this app makes that easy! I've never been able to keep a food diary, but I actually get excited to log my stuff because it's so user friendly and the database is huge! And the fact that I can scan barcodes for dietary information, wow. I bought a sandwich at Safeway that didn't have caloric info on the sticker (just ingredients) and it loaded all of the dietary information by scanning the barcode! The other night I had chicken broccoli Alfredo so I scanned my Alfredo sauce jar, my frozen broccoli package, searched for grilled chicken, and had my dinner logged in moments. Stick with Myfitnesspal and you are bound to be successful! Good luck! :)
