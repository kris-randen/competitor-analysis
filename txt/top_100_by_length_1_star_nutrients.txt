Title: Not worth the time
----------------------------------------------------------
When I saw the barcode scanner, I was pumped because I thought it would be something I could scan in my supplements, pre-packaged foods, etc. You can’t. Their database support for this app must be extremely limited, because I have yet to find something I can scan in! Then, to try and stay on track, you spend hours (if you’re me) looking for ingredient equivalents on their app, which only gives you a roundabout estimation of your consumption at best! Finally, since I paid for the app, I waited to see if they would upload more stuff to their database. It doesn’t appear that they have. Overall: 1/5, do NOT recommend.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your feedback. You can now enter your own foods into Nutrients including foods not found using the barcode scanner. Please give the new update a try!

Title: Not a useful app at all
----------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to track my nutritional intake to make sure I was getting enough vitamins, and was put-off by how “weight loss” focused other apps were, so I gave this a try. I cook at home, and input my recipes, but was confused to learn I could only use their library of ingredients, which doesn’t have a lot of my products. There’s no way to manually enter a product yourself. Once you manage to piece together a recipe that’s similar to what you make, there’s no way to add it to your daily journal of what you ate that day. A total waste of $5.

Title: ALMOST
----------------------------------------------------------
Good source of raw info but not useful as it could be.  A very disconnected and buggy.  You can waste so much time you're likely to forget why your trying.  Adding food to the pantry doesn't work, so you have to search each ingredient over again.  Create a recipe and there is no way to know the collective nutrient value.  The iPhone & iPad work independent so plan on doing it twice.  After three emails to support and no response, I guess there is none.  I am also disappointed in Apple for allowing this inferior app. For profit

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your review and sorry your emails went unanswered. Please make sure to send them to support@pomegranateapps.com. I always do my best to answer emails in a timely manner. This issue should be fixed now in the latest update. The "Pantry" tab has been renamed to "Favorites" and you can now add foods directly to that tab.

Title: Rip off
----------------------------------------------------------
I don't mind paying for an app at all... Especially when it's a good one that I will use a lot. But seriously??? Charging $2 for every category to be unlocked????  There's over 30!  That would be $60 or more just to get the info that I thought was already available in the app.  I don't know who the developers think will pay $60+ for an app. I'll go buy a book for $20...  And that's a shame because this app seems to be really great. Why not charge one time to upgrade to full access????

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for your review. The features from these previous in-app purchases are now included with the app so I would invite you to try the newest update. I'm also sorry for the confusion for version 2.7.1 from 2013. That in-app purchase for $2 allowed you to unlock all categories. You would have only be charged once and not $2 for each category.

Title: Disappointing
----------------------------------------------------------
It is not what I expected. Very limited and not user friendly: if you give top 100 foods with a certain vitamin, it would be logical to place a food with the highest content of the vitamin at the top of the list and with the lowest content at the bottom. The app is just an attempt to categorize random information about food. If I need just information, Google and Wikipedia are sufficient. I wish I could try the app before purchasing. I would never purchase it.

Title: Wasted $4.99
----------------------------------------------------------
Just downloaded this app today to find it’s very buggy on my iPad.  Newly created ingredients don’t add well to recipes.  Existing ingredients don’t scale nutrients properly when adding partial or multiple servings.  And as of ten minutes ago, the app is now crashing on launch.  All other apps are behaving fine, so it’s definitely a problem with this one.  Have tried restarting iPad, with no help.  Wasted $4.99 and wish I could get a refund.

Title: Needs a cumulative nutrition journal
----------------------------------------------------------
The journal is nothing more than a list of foods you ate - it does not generate a cumulative overview of of you nutrition for the day and make the app useless if you are trying to track your vitamin and mineral intake. How am I supposed to know what vitamins I am low in for the day? The app is the best I have seen to itemize the vitamins and mineral for EACH ITEM but the journal ruins the whole app for me. Please add a tracking system!

Title: Waste of Money
----------------------------------------------------------
There are better trackers available for free. I purchased this app because I didn’t want to pay the expensive subscription fees for other tracker apps to track more nutrients such as fiber intake, etc. The app doesn’t recognize half of my frequently eaten meals and snacks so all of that would have to be manually entered and it’s just not worth my time to do so when there are plenty of apps I can use that do this automatically.

I paid $5 for an app that I was only able to use for two days. I have tried to use the app on my iPhone AND my iPad. Both devices software are up to date.  I have had it downloaded for over a week and since the second day I’ve had it, it will not even open. I emailed the support email provided last week and no one has responded. Great concept but a complete waste of money and poor customer service.

Title: New version lacking key items
----------------------------------------------------------
Unless I'm missing something they new version has two glaring omissions from earlier version. First is search tool. Second is a correct list of foods highest in specific nutrients from most to least. For instance vitamin a or protein. You can select it but the order is no longer starting with the item with the most. Since his was one of the main reasons I liked this app, really don't like it now.

I made the mistake of purchasing reading great reviews. There was no free trial because you would not purchase this app when the free ones available are far superior with a live selection of foods that can be scanned in. This app only offers the most common brands such as Quacker. Save your money and get a free version or at least one with a free Trial. These reviews c  as my be legit.

Title: Limited foods... no option to add your own food brands
----------------------------------------------------------
Nice app if you're not concerned with accuracy. The food journal nutrition information doesn't tell you the total quantity (mg, mcg, IU, etc.) of the vitamin or mineral, it only shows a percentage you have consumed. The total vitamins and minerals needed for males and females is different and the app doesn't ask for sex to calculate the correct RDIs.

It displays chicken as having 21 carbs in a half chicken breast?!?! Nuff said! ... for all those people who know anything about nutrition, you know as well as I do that chicken is mostly protein and most all foods that are high in protein are low in carbs, especially meats. On this discrepancy alone this app deserve a bad rating.

After the glowing reviews and hype, I feel like I’ve been absolutely conned. This app failed to recognize 3 barcodes, the Journal is so small as to be almost unreadable, and no option is given to enter your age, current weight, or goals. It’s strictly a tallying device, and a clunky one, at that. I’d love to get my $5 back.

This is the absolute worst app. I paid 4.99 to use this app to calculate my nutrition facts for my recipes. It didn't even have simple products in the database for me to calculate. No cups or tablespoons not even servings. You cannot calculate anything right with this app. Best to not waste your money.

So the app is limited on sizes for items when creating a recipe for example you cannot enter 413g. You either get 350g or 465g(which you have to use a cups because the most grams you can enter is 200g using their options.

Thank you for your feedback. When selecting a serving size, you can tap the name of the serving size to enter a custom amount. You can also enter your own custom foods if you are not able to find them in Nutrients.
