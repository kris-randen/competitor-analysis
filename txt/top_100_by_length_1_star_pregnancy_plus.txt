Title: Devastated
----------------------------------------------------------
I was happy with it for my first 7 months of pregnancy until my iPhone needed updating. For some reason the app would not update, therefore I deleted it from my phone( not my cloud) and re-downloaded it back to my phone. Upon doing this, the app did not recognize my email address once I tried logging on nor would it allow me to reset my password. Remember, I've had it 7 months and used it daily with auto log in so I had trouble remembering my password. Well, it never recognized my email address so I created a new account, which only allowed me to view the pre- inserted baby photos until the 15 week mark. I had purchased this app for $3.99, 7 months ago and have used it daily. All of my info was lost because it did not remember my account.My weekly pregnancy photos that I uploaded, my completed birthing plan, notes, doctor visit info, important and exciting info that I've gathered for all of my pregnancy to date. I am devastated. I would not recommend this app as whatever glitch was in their system on this day cost me valuable info, not to mention my $3.99. And I do not have long to go.

Title: Wish I could like this
----------------------------------------------------------
I really loved this app up until 14 weeks. After that, you have to pay. Listen, I work for a mobile app company so I understand that apps need to make money somehow, but I agree with other reviewers that the developer goes about it the wrong way. I don’t want to pay for an app that I won’t be using past my due date. There are plenty of ways to keep your users active past this “cut-off” time of 14 weeks while still being able to monetize. Unobtrusive ads in a free version and an ad-free version is one way. It’s how so many apps do business these days and users will understand. Just shutting your app off completely to users after 14 weeks unless they pay feels like a crappy way to make money off your users. Especially since this will be a temporary app for so many. This is a crowded app space and there are so many other free apps that offer me the weekly updates I want, so I no longer use this app. I hope the developers reconsider their paid structure one day bc it is truly a wonderful app up until 14 weeks.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
The one-off payment we ask protects your privacy and ensures your app won't have lots of ads. And the App can be used for multiple pregnancies. We understand your opinion but free apps may use your data and we respect your privacy. So, after the 14th week of pregnancy, we ask for small one-off payment instead. We hope you understand our position.

Title: Not happy...
----------------------------------------------------------
I had the app when I found out I was pregnant with my first baby girl, however I recently after giving birth on May 15th this year came back into the app & somehow my info changed & I couldn’t change it back. Like my due date was May 19th-2019 but it said a different date and I tried fixing it but it wouldn’t let me pick my dam due date to fix it even if i already had my baby. You should really fix it because I was loving the app since it was my first baby & wanted to keep the memory of it...I had to reset my app with all the memories  of my daughter & I'm very upset about it..maybe I’m the only one but this was sentimental to me seeing I wasn’t able to have kids at all & she was my miracle & rainbow baby. I wanted to keep the app & all the info for my memories & safe keeping but it wouldn’t let me simply change it back to my due date/day she was born, it needs an option to go back whether the date was another year or whatever.

Title: DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
Over all, I like this app BUT it waited until I was 28 weeks pregnant to tell me that the free trial period was up and I had to pay $3.99 for the full version. If I would have known that, I would have done it 28 weeks ago. Now it's like I'm forced to buy it and I won't be using it after the baby comes so why waste $4 for a few more weeks of use? I'm promptly deleting it just on principal. Not fair guys! Some apps I've had on my phone for years and actually get some use out of. Those apps were not even close to $4. This app is just a glorified ticker if you don't have the full app. At 14 weeks it also stops showing you images of the actual size of your baby. It also stops giving you updates on your baby. Your better off downloading "What to expect when your expecting" app or "baby center" app, which are born FREE! I don't mind paying for apps, but I want to be able to use them, so this one is a waste.

Title: Trigger Warnings Needed
----------------------------------------------------------
For someone who has PTSD surrounding cancer, this app does a terrible job at proving trigger warnings. I.e they do not at all. I pulled up an article that was suggested for me on that day and it was incredibly triggering to my PTSD. There were no warnings at all and the article presented facts that were honestly written in a way that was anxiety inducing. On top of all this, this app also tells you very little about what is actually going on with your baby compared to other apps where there is a lot more information. They also have some outdated information about chromosomal abnormalities tests. Overall, I liked this app to begin with but I had to delete it because their articles have been triggering anxiety for me more than once now. I wish the app developer would include content warnings before you click on the articles.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, sorry to hear you feel this way about some of our articles. We would like to find out more about the articles you have found particularly triggering, please could you send us an email at support@health-and-parenting.com so we can look into your feedback further? Thanks in advance for your contact. Kind regards.

Title: Misleading
----------------------------------------------------------
This application is decent, I found some information to be different than that which is on other sites. Regardless, when you get up to your second trimester, the require you to pay. I find that to be so misleading and pathetic, because you download these apps unaware of this fact, and then you are used to getting weekly or daily updates, and all of the sudden you feel kind of pressured to update.  Honestly, it's just not a way I would have ran an app. I would have much rather had fans of the app appreciate and appreciate the resources they have been given thus far, and then switch it up. I noticed I'm not the only one who thinks so. Anyone who doesn't agree must have a tendency to waste money or must work for the app. Regardless it's not about the $4 it's about the principal.

Title: Cant add a new pregnancy
----------------------------------------------------------
I was excited when this app popped up because I used it with my first pregnancy with my son, and couldn’t wait to use it again. When I logged in, it kept saying my due date was out of bounds (because my son was born in 2018). When I tried to change the information to have a new due date, the app said that I would have to create a new Phillips account. So I tried to do that, only to be told that 2 accounts with the same email can’t exist. I do not have and do not want a second email. I’ve used several apps for both pregnancies so far and all of the other ones let me add a new pregnancy to an existing account. I’m not sure why this app thinks that you can only have one child, but it’s extremely disappointing.

Title: Absolutely LOVED this app for my singleton pregnant, not my twin pregnancy
----------------------------------------------------------
I absolutely loved the app for my singleton pregnancy and would recommend it to any moms expecting one baby. And was eager to explore the app after finding out I was having twins! Was extremely disappointed to start off with the fact that they don’t have a twin pregnancy feature. You can change the gender from boy to girl to twins. But that is it! I kept the app because each week they have a nice little twins/ multiples article. As my pregnancy progresses, I am growing more disappointed as the articles are really more like fun facts about twins rather than information about your twin pregnancy that week. With multiple pregnancies on the rise, you should really do better for other moms!

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
We're sorry to learn you're so disappointed in the App this time around. Though we do not offer an App specifically for twins, many of the Baby > Weekly entries have information about pregnancy with multiples. In addition, you can change the settings by going to Profile (upper right) > scroll down to the Pregnancy section > Baby sex > Twins. While this will not significantly change the information in the App, it will change the way the App refers to your babies. In addition, this setting will swap out some of the images in the Baby > Images section of the App. For example, 3D scan images for weeks 7,9,10,11 and 13 are of twins/multiples when the app is set to to twin pregnancy. We hope this information helps you have a 5-star experience with the App.

Title: Better apps out there for FREE
----------------------------------------------------------
Love how this app says to download for FREE access but, what they fail to mention is you actually have to PAY for that access. If you’re so smart to make an app, I’m sure you would know the definition of what “free” means... sorry, but your misleading information means I don’t trust anything this app has to offer. I could care less that you don’t want my data and that free means there has to be ads. None of my other pregnancy apps are full of ads and they are FREE and do the EXACT same thing this app does... with a better screen format and easier usage. Why would I pay for this app when all the information you provide is not only free on the internet BUT also other apps.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
The one-off payment we ask protects your privacy and ensures your app won't have lots of ads. We understand your opinion but free apps may use your data and we respect your privacy. So, after the 14th week of pregnancy, we ask for small one-off payment instead. We hope you understand.

Title: I love this app but am not happy
----------------------------------------------------------
The app kicked me off. I am not able to log back in. I have all my information saved on it like baby data and names. I’ve tried many many times to log back in and it says I don’t have an account or the password is wrong when I know for a fact what my log in info is. I wrote it down and put it in my photos by taking a screen shot of the email and password when I made them. I even tried to reset my password but nothing worked. This has really upset me. This app is very useful the images are wonderful and details are great. The options it gives help you feel more organized and prepared. Which I feel like I e lost all this when I put trust in the app and it’s now gone. :(

Started using this app when I found out I was pregnant. I'm now 15wks and last wk (my 14th wk) the app stopped working. I contacted someone by email to only be told that the app stops working on lite version at 13wks (not stated in the description btw), so disappointing app! Unless you dnt mind paying for it after the "trial period" as I'm calling it, dnt even bother installing. There's plenty more good quality pregnancy apps out there that offer the same services (baby's development and your body changes) FOR FREE! I'm actually loving one right now, that I started using just yesterday.

Title: Racist app
----------------------------------------------------------
I do not like how the app gives African Americans hair a nappy look. The rest of the baby options hair is nice and laid down. However the black baby hair looks as if the hairs are just bushy. When all babies come out I can say hair texture is the same. I really think that’s a total disrespect to my race and overall that really sets the tone for horrible app. The moms stomach growth is white. Why no option for people of color there too. Everything seems to be catered to white people this is completely disrespectful and unfair. So I will be deleting this app until they can get it right.

I loved this app with my daughter it was my go to out of five I had downloaded HOWEVER I am currently expecting my second child and all of my other apps make it easy and convenient to add my second pregnancy except this one! This app is trying to force me to delete my daughters pregnancy in order for me to add a new one and I REFUSE to delete or”back up somewhere else” my beautiful pregnancy that I should be able to flip back and forth between the two and remember things and millstones that happened during my daughters and current pregnancy. It’s a shame this app is a shame!

Title: Locks you out by week 15 unless you pay
----------------------------------------------------------
I liked this app in the beginning. It had good features like tracking your weight, descriptions of the baby and daily blogs (some helpful, some meh, some just wrong info). Then at my 14 week mark little padlock icons started showing up blocking the screen with "if you want to continue, please pay to unlock the rest of the app!" By week 15 the entire app (except the home page) is locked unless you pay. In order for sites to demand that you pay they've got to be pretty darn good, this is not one of them that is worth paying for. Deleted it, go with Ovia, whole thing is free.

Title: This app ruined my first pregnancy journal
----------------------------------------------------------
I had been keeping my notes each week and I was a couple days from getting my pregnancy journal in the mail to transfer all my info. I went in the app to add more notes and all my notes were gone. 20 weeks worth of notes. I emailed them and they said they could get them back that I just needed to send them info. I sent them what they needed and my notes still haven’t came back. I guess that’s what I get for trusting technology. I will be switching pregnancy apps. Don’t put any of you’re important info on here cause you will lose it. So much for my pregnancy journal.

Title: Be Upfront
----------------------------------------------------------
Just like the other reviews, I was pretty surprised to find the app was useless after 14 weeks without paying. There is nothing that tells you or warns you that that's the case. I get all the arguments for charging, and pay for quite a few apps. However, there is no notice that this is going to happen until it just stops working. Surprising your users with the fee does nothing but alienate them. I should have read these reviews before I downloaded. Also, I don't think this app is useful enough, at least for me, to warrant the $4.99 fee. Maybe $1.99, but not $4.99.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
We appreciate your comments about pricing. After a free trail, we do ask for a small one-off payment as we don't want to fill your App with lots of advertising. When advertising is involved YOU, the user, are the product. If other Apps are FREE, it means in some way they use your data. We are not interested in your data and always respect your privacy.

Title: Inaccurate
----------------------------------------------------------
Many of the articles in this app contain medically dated, or even inaccurate, information. For instance, this weeks article claimed it was necessary for pregnant women to “minimize caffeine” to avoid causing low birth weight, birth defects, and long term health complications. This does not reflect current medical research on the subject. A far more useful article might have said something like, “doctors recommend fewer than 140mg of caffeine a day, though evidence suggests that it would take more than 40 cups of coffee in a day to induce miscarriage.”

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
We appreciate your feedback and will check again the caffeine information to make changes as needed for a future update. Thanks to feedback from customers like you we can continue to improve our App.

I loved this app, and so did my family. We shared and updated with it. And then on day 99 (when my first trimester ended), the app quit letting me read info. Now I have to pay $4 for the full version. They tease you with the first trimester info, and then expect you to pay for stuff that was free the day before. Too many free and useful tools online and available through my OB for me to pay for an app that preys on the excitement of new moms. Shame on you for misleading and taking advantage of people who want information about their growing babies.

Title: Super annoyed
----------------------------------------------------------
This app is insisting I’m not as far along as I actually am- I’ve already had my dating scan and was told a specific number of weeks and days by the sonogram technician. This app only requested due date information- nothing about dates for the menstrual cycle. I personally find it aggravating since in order for an expecting mother to provide her due date, she’d also know how far along she was. At least make it an option. Anyways, now I’m being given late information and there’s no way I can tweak it to make it more personalised.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
You can open your Profile (upper right circle), scroll down to the Pregnancy section, and select 'Calculate due date.' The App will allow you to select either the first day of your last period, the date of conception or the estimated due date - you can enter one of these and the other two will be calculated from that. If you need any help with this, please contact our customer service team using the Contact us link in the app or by email at support@health-and-parenting.com

Title: Used to be great, now useless
----------------------------------------------------------
This app used to be great, I used it during my wife’s last pregnancy. Now I’m using it again and at 14 weeks there was an update and now i can’t see ANYTHING of value without upgrading to the paid app. Again, all of which used to be free. So the unpaid version is useless to me as my wife is 17 weeks pregnant and my app won’t display anything past 14 weeks any longer unless I pay for it. Not interested. Plenty of free apps for this out there. Uninstalled and updated my five star rating to a one star rating.

This app is marketed as a pregnancy app when it should be  advertised at the first 14 weeks app because literally everything on the app becomes completely unavailable after that. And even during those short few weeks, there are many functions of the app that are unavailable to non-paying users. I didn't find anything original and/or different about this app compared to the HONESTLY a free ones that would make me want to pay $4 for it. It's absolutely ridiculous. Wish I didn't waste my time downloading it.

----------------------------------------------------------
It was a great app and I looked and heckled it everyday in my pregnancy until week 14 and then I got cut off unexpectedly because I had to pay for the rest of my weeks of pregnancy. Absolute crap !! What a serious rip off. You should make the Pro version like other period tracker apps that you can upgrade with cooler things as an incentive, not to track your 3/4 of pregnancy. Very upsetting. It honestly was the best pregnancy app that looked the best and had the best pictures and information. Pretty sad.

I paid for the full app because it said it would let me see info past 28 or so weeks, but it also promised tons of extra features. Paid for the full app, and didn't get one single extra feature. Rip off. Plus, it's pretty dumb that you have to choose baby names from their very limited list. You can't add your own to keep track of names you're actually thinking of using. Finally, half the daily blog posts are full of misinformation and are written not by healthcare professionals, but by first-time moms.

Title: Charged twice and the app still doesn't work!
----------------------------------------------------------
First off, the app somehow allows you to make an in-app purchase without creating an account for authorization. After creating the account it doesn't sync any information or remember that you made a purchase, therefore misleading you to purchase it again on another device. Their FAQ  states "As long as you sign into the same App Store account you used to purchase the Pregnancy App the first time, you will never have to pay twice. Under the ‘Buy the App’ button there’s a ‘Restore your purchase’ link."

----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app for 16 weeks and just realized it only allows me to see weekly baby images until week 14. The rest are for paid members. I find this very sneaky that this was hidden until now. I might have paid for it if they mentioned it in the beginning. The app itself isn't that great to worth paying for. There are other pregnancy apps with better information than this one. Also, the movement and animation at the top is very annoying. Should only animate once when the app first loads.

I have not been able to use my app since the latest update. Once it asks me to choose my 3D model, it does nothing. I’ve tried letting it sit, closing out, uninstalling/installing and nothing works. The model WILL NOT load. And that’s my favorite thing about the app. I loved it up until then. I’ve tried loading it on just data, and I’ve tried different WiFi networks. I suspect a bug in the app. I will update and give 5 stars when this is fixed. Up until then, I will remain salty(hormones, sorry).

I downloaded this app as it appeared to have detailed content and I enjoyed the images of the weekly fetus. However, this app's advertising is misleading. It is not free as you will need to pay $3.99 to access any content post 14 weeks. Had the app been up front about the cost I likely would have paid. However, I do not enjoy being coerced into the payment and will be switching apps. I wish I had just downloaded a different app from the start in order to prevent the need to re-enter all data.

Title: No info after 15 weeks
----------------------------------------------------------
I have several pregnancy apps and enjoy checking them all weekly for the updates. But this app stops giving you any information at 15 weeks, asking instead that you buy the paid version. Their app is not special or interesting enough for me to want to pay for information I can get for free literally all over the Internet and via other apps. I will be deleting this one. I highly recommend Ovia if you're looking for an informative, modern app with a gorgeous interface.

Title: Refun or fix the app
----------------------------------------------------------
I have been using this app for almost 20 weeks now, loved it, saved baby names doctors and other important numbers and appointments on here, the kick counter and other things. I get on the other day just to find everything has been wiped, from my phone and iPad. This is very frustrating, I would like this fixed, every time I get back on I have to resign in and reenter the due date every time now. So I would like my info restored or a refund of my money!!

Title: Other better apps! Don’t waste $$$
----------------------------------------------------------
What happened!!?? I can’t believe I paid for this app and now I’m just going to delete it. It worked fine for my first pregnancy but now it won’t work. Every time I open the app it says welcome and it tells me my due date is off and to turn it on. I’ve done this everyday! It won’t remember my info and it resets back to the beginning. It deleted all my previous Baby names and my current appointments! Don’t waste your money! Plenty of other great apps!

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
We're sorry you encountered this temporary bug. You'll be pleased to hear we managed to resolve the issue. Perhaps you would like to re-enter your due date to use the app for your current pregnancy. Wishing you a happy and health pregnancy journey. Kind regards

Title: Another way to make money on moms
----------------------------------------------------------
Please don’t try to trap us, every time I click on whatever I want to see i get this Buy NOW $1.99, $1.99. Why is $1.99? Why not $1 or $2? Sorry pregnancy app, I would rather use my money to buy my baby outfits, diapers or medical bills, and whatever I don’t understand or would like to know about how babies grown, names, kicks, foods I will use google searching. Google is free, and there are a lot of information on it including pictures and videos.

Thank you for your feedback about the App pricing. While much of the App is free, certain features do require a premium upgrade. We will share your comments with our development team, though. Thanks to feedback from customers like you we can continue to improve the App.

----------------------------------------------------------
I used this app when I was pregnant with my son and loved it so of course I downloaded it again for this pregnancy only to be very disappointed that now I would have to pay $4 for it. I only use the app for 9 months and have to pay for it. That is ridiculous and I refuse to do so.  I used to use the app to show my class of 4 yr olds the different stages that the baby was at bc they are very excited about a baby growing in their teachers tummy.

Title: Pointless
----------------------------------------------------------
I had this app throughout 2016 for my first pregnancy and the app was free for the weekly updates all the way up to my due date. I am 11 weeks along right now with my second and I was scrolling through and now I have to purchase the app to be able to see past 14 weeks for ANYTHING. This app is ridiculous. There are many other pregnancy apps that give you weekly updates ALL THE WAY TO THE DUE DATE! This used to be free, why the sudden change?

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Our App has always had a free version and a premium upgraded version. The one-off payment we ask protects your privacy and ensures your app won't have lots of ads. We understand your opinion, but free apps may use your data and we respect your privacy. So, after the 14th week of pregnancy, we ask for small one-off payment instead. We hope you understand. If you previously purchased the full app and need help restoring it, please contact our customer service department at support@health-and-parenting.com

----------------------------------------------------------
I find it rather humorous that the app itself is free until 15 weeks. I wouldn't mind if it were forthcoming with the price but the fact that it's "free" and then you get the oh it's 3.99 after 15 weeks is not only disappointing but it's deceitful. I really enjoyed this app and would have gladly paid for it but to con me into it is disgusting. There are better apps that are upfront about the price. Too bad, I would have recommended this app.

----------------------------------------------------------
I was extremely happy with this app and thought the info included was better than any other pregnancy app I was using.  That was until day 91 when it stopped advancing.  It has kept track of my progress on the initial page but the daily and weekly updates do not go past day 91.  I have deleted and reinstalled the app four times in an effort to get it to work properly again and nothing has worked.  Overall, a very disappointing experience.

Title: App stops at 15 weeks
----------------------------------------------------------
One of the main reasons as to why I chose this app out of all of the other ones was because of all of the detailed pictures of the babies it has. I was absolutely devastated when there were no more pictures after week 14. I'm short on money and will not pay for the other half of this app, but as an expecting mother, I would appreciate if you could make this app free for people who are really interested in the growth of their children.

I downloaded this app for free and I was able to look ahead through every step.  Even though this is my 3rd pregnancy, it is my daughter's first time participating with preparing for her baby sister.  She loved watching how the baby grows and keeping track of my health.  Now, I have to pay 4 freaking dollars to see what goes on past a certain point that I have already passed!!! It didn't do that last week, so why now?? Greedy asshats!

Title: Not free
----------------------------------------------------------
This app was ok up until my 15th week when it wasn’t free anymore. And after reading through a ton of reviews I found that not only does the developer always spell trial wrong but they don’t understand what the word free means. Sure other apps use my data but I'm on WiFi at all times. Sure other apps may have ads but I prefer ads to paying for an app. It’s honestly not worth paying for. Download The Bump instead, that app is great.

----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve used this app my whole pregnancy up to 30 weeks but with the recent update it’s stopped working completely. The app asks you to create a new login or login with a shared website. I tried the login I have for the app and it failed. I created a new account (twice) and both times it failed. But when I tried the email addresses again it said an account was already created. I loved this app and I’m sad I can’t continue using it.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Sorry to hear you are having problems with the update. You will be pleased to know we have temporarily discontinued the migration process. Please close the app and open it again. After that, you should be able to use the app as usual. Please note that we will be resuming the migration process in the near future.

Title: Misleading... Not a free app.
----------------------------------------------------------
So disappointed... Was really liking this app, but as soon as I hit my second trimester, features stopped working unless I upgraded to the pay app. By 16 weeks the app was pretty much not functional at all because every useful feature was locked without the upgrade. Would have much rather seen that it was a $4 app from the beginning and I would have been more likely to pay for it. I feel misled and will find a new app to use.

I got this app under the impression it was free. This is not the case so be warned! I can see paying for one or two extras or no ads but when I download a free pregnancy app I should at least be able to get the week-by-week updates for free. If you want to see more than an arm or leg in the weekly pictures you also have to pay. Overall I am pretty disappointed and will be deleting this app and downloading a different one.

----------------------------------------------------------
This application is okay for use. My only issue is the characteristic for a African American baby when it comes to hair. When all babies are born they all have the same texture of hair. The hair doesn’t change for at least 6 to 7 months after the baby is born. How the image is depicted comes across racist and bias. To whom ever created this app need to change how the African American child is featured as a baby.

This is app is handy to keep track of the weeks and I like the images of baby. The articles, however, are so outdated and the information is uninformative and very “by the book”.

Most articles are very aligned with the heavily medical pregnancy/labor/birth and don’t at all offer helpful perspectives to anyone that is planning a more natural pregnancy/birth.

----------------------------------------------------------
Makes it seem like the app comes in contraction timers and kick counts, but they’re locked behind a pay wall that you aren’t aware is even there until you click the “start” button. Then it redirects you to a “pay to upgrade” page. NO THANKS! Wish they’d just charge 1.99 for the app on the front end instead of forcing you to upgrade at the end if you want to keep all your data all in one place.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
We do note that the App contains In App Purchases in our listing. Only a small amount of the App's content is a premium upgrade - much of the App can be used throughout pregnancy for free. We will share your pricing feedback with our team, though. Thanks to feedback from customers like you we can continue to improve the App.

Sorry, but this app is pointless past 14 weeks. I'm 29 weeks and just downloaded it, only to find that I can't even read the weekly pregnancy updates (after 14 weeks) without paying to upgrade. I understand having paid features, but they're going about it the wrong way. The weekly updates are the main reason people seek out these types of apps, and should not be what we have to pay for.

Developer Response:

While we understand your opinion, we would like to highlight that free apps aren't really free - they might use your data or fill your app with lots of ads. We prefer to ask for a small one-off payment instead after the 14th week of pregnancy. We hope you understand.

Many features of the app are blocked unless you pay for it, which initially does not seem to matter. However, in your second trimester you can no longer use the app unless you pay.

There are no original insights into the world of expectant parents with this app. They just give you a recycled blog based off of your current week since conception. Oh and, at week 14, they try to pump you for $3.99! There is no "lite" version, and they never specified that in the App Store. This app comes up if you type in "free pregnancy app." IT IS NOT FREE.

Title: Not Truly Free
----------------------------------------------------------
If a company is going to offer a free product, make it free at the time of download. Period. Otherwise charge up-front at the time of download. Women download this app thinking they don't have to pay for the content, then after 14 weeks, surprise! You have to pay to play. That is not transparent at all. Especially since it's not mentioned on the detail page of the app store.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
After a free trail, we ask for a small one-off payment as we don't want to fill your App with lots of advertising. When advertising is involved YOU, the user, are the product. If other Apps are FREE, it means in some way they use your data. We are not interested in your data and always respect your privacy. We do appreciate your feedback and will share your comments with our developers - our App is evidence-based and always reviewed by medical professionals - so customers can trust what they read.

The free version isn't just limited to a few basic features, it also stops allowing you to access the app after a few weeks & requires purchase upgrade. Also, not worthwhile. Was using during my 4th pregnancy, and it provides a bunch of fru-fru garbage, while not providing essential info, like safe/unsafe medications, etc.

Title: Too pricey for what you get
----------------------------------------------------------
I was using the app along with my several other free ones until they wanted me to pay for it at week 15. Why would I ever spend $3.99 on an app when there are plenty more apps out there for free and/or the same information is available on the internet for free? I would have spent $.99 on it but $3.99 for a stupid app?! HA!

Title: You have to pay to use this app
----------------------------------------------------------
I gave this app 1 Star, I think it’s awful that this app charges you to use 100% of its capabilities. Especially being a first time mom all of this is new for me and I was disappointed after getting to 14 weeks that I could no longer view images of what my baby looks like unless I updated and paid. It’s ridiculous.

After the 14th week of pregnancy, we ask for a small one-off payment as we don't want to fill this beautiful App with lots of irrelevant advertising. Please be assured that your data is used to personalise the App’s content. For example, so we can show you articles to your specific week of pregnancy. Your data is respected with the highest level of security and privacy protocols.

----------------------------------------------------------
I loved this app. It was my favorite pregnancy app until the update that merged with Phillips account. I have tried several times to get into the app and it just keeps telling me it encountered a problem. Please go back to the way it was. Sadly If it doesn’t resolve soon I’ll just delete it and find one that works.

Title: App cuts off use if you don’t pay!!!!
----------------------------------------------------------
I really enjoyed this app at first. I got to add my weight gains, keep track of doctors appts, even store belly pics, daily reads and weekly; it was all so informative and helpful. BUT at 14 weeks it does cut you off unless you upgrade and pay as a heads up! I switched to the Bump app and have been very satisfied!

We appreciate your feedback. The one-off payment we ask protects your privacy and ensures your app won't have lots of irrelevant ads. We understand your opinion, though, and will share it with our developers.

Title: Loved it at first but...
----------------------------------------------------------
I downloaded this app when I was 8 weeks pregnant. I LOVED everything about it. Here's where it lost me; When you hit your 15th week, you have to pay $4 just to get your weekly update now. Not cool. So go with something else. What To Expect When You're expecting is a great app that gives you all your weeks.

----------------------------------------------------------
Having to pay $3.99 for this app after 15 weeks is a huge let down. Especially when there are so many other equally great apps that cost nothing. I only really used this app for the weekly photos and I can find the same on another app at no cost (and Google). I'm going to say goodbye to Pregnancy+.

Title: Other apps provide same info free
----------------------------------------------------------
The app wants you to pay for the pro version after 14 weeks. I was pretty disappointed by that so I ended up downloading the Ovia pregnancy app which has the same information and even adds in a pregnancy calendar that this one doesn’t have. Bottom line it’s ok but not worth buying the pro version.

After the 14th week of pregnancy, we ask for a small one-off payment as we don't want to fill this beautiful App with lots of advertising. When advertising is involved YOU, the user, are the product. If other Apps are FREE, it means in some way they use your data. We are not interested in your data and always respect your privacy.

Title: Scam. Not free.
----------------------------------------------------------
Like many others, I was disappointed to find out the app is useless beyond week 14 when you have to upgrade and pay. Switching to a free option because pregnancy is temporary and I don't need to pay for this app that is nothing special beyond the rest of the information that is available for free.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
We do ask a small fee after the 14th week to keep your App free of irrelevant advertising. Please be assured that your data is used to personalise the App’s content.

----------------------------------------------------------
Loved this app until I have to pay to see what happens after 1st trimester. There’s no warning on the app detail page that we’re going to end up paying after a certain week, which is very misleading. There are so many free pregnancy app with useful information, I would recommend those other apps.

Same as everyone else, dissatisfied with the 14 week surprise payment. If the app had been upfront about the payment instead of waiting to spring it on you maybe I would have bought but nah. All my other free apps that stay free work fine, no adds, and don’t use up my data. Thanks though.

We appreciate your feedback. Our download page does indicate that the App has In App Purchases, but we're sorry you were caught off guard. We'll see if we can improve the way the App is presented to customers.

I totally love this app. I made a switch to iOS recently and was unable to retrieve my subscription. On contacting the customer service, they said they cannot and asked me to purchase it again. I was able to retrieve all my purchases except for this app. Too bad for a well rated app.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
If the App was originally purchased for iOS, you should be able to download it again without paying. If you have switched from Android to iOS, though, you would need to buy it again since Google Play and Apple's App Store are completely different companies. This is standard for most paid Apps. We apologize for any inconvenience.

You can only see what happens with the first trimester. After that you have to purchase the full version to read anything or see photos of what the baby looks like. Kind of a waist of my time since I'm at week 35. I created my profile to find out I need to purchase the full version.

Unless you want to pay, don't get this app. Once you pass week 14 you will have to pay. I think that's a little deceiving that you can use the app and get used to it and then they make you pay for over half of the pregnancy. There are other (really) free apps that are much better!

----------------------------------------------------------
The images have changed in some phones and it is not accurate anymore. The images show a 2 weeks delay on the development of the fetus. I contacted the support and they gave me two distinct answers. I was so upset. This was my go to app for pregnancy. It is not anymore.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
We apologize for any confusion. Previously some of the images in the early weeks were wrongly dated through embryology, rather than using the traditional LMP dates. This means that we needed to revise some of the images (move them to the correct week) and update the App.
