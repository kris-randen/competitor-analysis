Title: Terrible if you’re interested primarily in nutrition
----------------------------------------------------------
MyNetDiary is way better if you care about correct nutrition intake. This app does not count nutrition from branded foods! Almost everything I eat including packaged organic fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables are from Trader Joe’s. If I scan that in or use existing entries, none of those nutrients are counted! Also if I scan in vitamins, they are not on file and I submitted photos but they are branded vitamins obviously so they probably won’t count either. What is the point of scanning in products if it doesn’t count the nutrients? It only counts the nutrients in generic foods, not from anything you scan in. Even MyFitnessPal counts basic nutrients from scanned foods. Also it added 1% alcohol to my total macros when I had nothing even resembling alcohol! Makes me doubt the whole app. I will definitely stick to NyNetDiary which has a better UI and fantastic nutrition tracking of like 30 nutrients and counts vitamin supplements!

Title: Great App BUT *One* Star (READ!)
----------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely fantastic app with a resource-rich library of foods from many different restaurants along with every food at your local grocery store.   HOWEVER!  I have one huge problem: Most days I’ll update food for the day before or the day after (good planning) ... but every single time I update food for a different day the app will log it on the present day in the timeframe that I’m presently in. Every. Single. Day. For over a year. I’ll update something for a different day than I’m currently in and every single day it will log the food I scan on the day that I’m presently in.  IF this gets changed I will be more than happy to give this app the full FIVE STARS I know it deserves!!!!

Title: Log in AGAIN?!?!
----------------------------------------------------------
I just started using this app 3 days ago and let me tell you one thing that’s going to piss me off real quick, the fact that I have to log in over and over again. I just logged in 3 hours ago and logged my breakfast foods and now at lunch I have to log in AGAIN!!! Why?? This app is on my personal phone that only I use so why, for the love of god, do I have to enter my email and password EVERY. TIME. I. USE. THE. APP???? So, let me get this straight... we have people on this earth that are smart enough to launch people into space but this company can’t make an app that can remember my password?!? JESUS CHRIST!!

Title: Entering my meals kicks me out of the app
----------------------------------------------------------
I’ve been using this app for over a year now and I absolutely love it. however, I guess the app updated itself today and it’s giving me some issues. when I tried to log my dinner by typing it into the search, as soon as I typed a couple letters, the screen would turn black and take me out of the app. I kept trying to type it in but the screen kept kicking me out of the app. I deleted the app and reinstalled it multiple times but it still didn’t work. really hope you guys figure this out because I love this app and I think it’s much better than other apps like my fitness pal.

Title: DO NOT USE THIS APP
----------------------------------------------------------
This WAS a great app to track you calorie consumption, but the recent update deleted many useful features. Gone is the ability to look up a restaurant or fast-food joints, see what's on their menu and get the calorie count. Gone is a growing history of the foods you have consumed which allowed you to quickly select again. Gone is the ability to look up calorie count of items while you shop. Gone is the ability to log a complete meal. In other words, some of the useful features were removed making this APP useless.

Title: App crashes with latest update
----------------------------------------------------------
I would rate this 4 or 5 stars as I have been using it for 2 years now without any issues. However, with this last update the app crashes every single time I try to type in a new food to search. It was probably introduced with their new feature with the pop up tips (which I actually find annoying). This app is completely unusable now. If they don’t fix this soon I will sadly be forced to start using a different app. PLEASE FIX THIS SOON!!!

Title: Chokes on its own data
----------------------------------------------------------
Good functions and works well for a while until it starts to choke on its data.  Then it slows down and is unusable. I tried deleting and reinstalling it, but since the data is stored in a cloud somewhere, deleting it does not delete the data.  So the reinstalled app continues to choke on its own data.  My solution was to simply delete and switch to a different app.

Title: Definitely not all it’s cracked up to be
----------------------------------------------------------
This app promises to be very useful, even being integrated with Alexa. It allows you to make up your own recipes, but then makes it very difficult to log them. If you use the app with Alexa, it also tends to log way more food than you want. For example, if you ask her to log half a cup of muesli, she’ll automatically add a whole cup. It definitely needs more work.

Title: This app can’t tell me if I’m meeting my nutritional needs
----------------------------------------------------------
Am I meeting my nutritional requirements? Unfortunately, this  app can’t  tell me.  Stats need to Include %-RDA/AI for Micronutrients like selenium, all vitamins, not just the mcg or iu you ate.  Needs %-RDA/AI for Micronutrients before I can use this.  Check out fitday.com, old school but tells me if I’m getting enough selenium & vitamins in my diet.

Title: Too tiny and doesn’t work well on ipad
----------------------------------------------------------
I use a Bluetooth keyboard on my ipad, so I’m looking at my screen with the long side horizontal, like a laptop.  This app does not rotate, nor does it even take up the whole screen.  Even if I rotate my ipad, the app would still be inconvenient to use because it’s way smaller than the screen.

This brand new app isn't sized properly for an iPhone 6/6S, so the whole interface is scaled to the two (going on three) year old display size. This app still wouldn't have been great on a phone in 2013, but at least it would behave correctly. Nutritionix should be embarrassed by this app.

This was promising the 1st day. I signed up, logged all my info into the app n all was well. Wake up today n ....nothing. My account doesn't even show up. All in all, a waste of time. Deleting n going back to the old app. Good luck with future updates since this needs help now.

Developer Response: 
----------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for reaching out! When opening the Track app, the app will open by default to your log for the current day. So if your day is just starting, the app will open to a blank log - just waiting for you to add that day's foods! You can use the arrows below the calorie bar to navigate to previous days' logs. Are you have trouble seeing data for previous dates? In this case, don't hesitate to send further details to our team at support@nutritionix.com so that we can get you back on Track. Thanks!
