0,0,5,2018-03-14T18:09:13.000Z,MeganMMac87,Love this app!,"I never gave a crap about my diabetes until I lost both of my parents at the age of 51. They both were diabetic and although that wasn‚Äôt necessarily the cause of their death as my dad had cancer and my mom had an upper GI bleed along with other issues it certainly did not help. My A1C was out of control at 10.2! Here I was downing mountain dews and never checking my sugar eating whatever I wanted. I gave up sodas, and fast food but finally have started checking my sugar as well. My endocrinologist has requested that I check my sugar randomly throughout the day and keep a record... well it has finally happened because of this app! üíï"
1,1,2,2018-12-26T06:44:15.000Z,GregMatthews,Ads make it worthless,"The app has a lot of decent features. The interface is cluttered to the point it‚Äôs hard to use and hard to find things. The reporting aspect of the app is poorly done, and that‚Äôs the most important part. In the free version, the ads after a day become so obnoxious that it‚Äôs fundamentally unusable. Full screen ads with the volume forced to 100% that offends everyone in the room. If you purchase this app you are funding a company that cares about monetizing the app far more than providing a good user experience. A premium subscription is VERY expensive, and honestly provides only a few real benefits, outside of removing the ads. I will look at EVERY alternative in the App Store before I feed this marketing tactic. There is a ‚Äúplus‚Äù version with a one time app purchase that likely removes some ads, but there is no clear statement of any difference so the only way to know is to buy it and find out. If you read enough review responses, you will learn if you buy that version you simply get another nagging form of encouragement to buy the expensive subscription. What this app provides is worth no where close to what the premium version provides."
2,2,1,2018-02-04T02:57:44.000Z,mommahippi,This app was great,"I loved this app before they changed to the subscription model a few months back. There are so many things you used to be able to do that aren‚Äôt available, even small things like using a custom label instead of before/after a meal. And now in order to share your graphs with your doctor you can only go back two weeks and you have to print it out vs email it. It‚Äôs a real shame not to be able to afford an app that used to be an asset to my medical care. I would have been able to use this app had there been a one time purchase price, but I can‚Äôt justify adding another monthly automatic charge just to log my glucose levels. I used to hype this app to everyone I knew with diabetes. Even my doctor was impressed, although I had to explain what happened when I could no longer send her my full detailed data via the health portal. Now I tell everyone about the app, explain how the developers forced a subscription model on users, and use it as an example of how patients suffer when profiting from their diseases becomes the goal. I wish I had never trusted this developer with my data. Now it‚Äôs locked away and I had to start over again with another app."
3,3,1,2019-03-22T14:22:48.000Z,HaveAGreatDay:),"Not easy to use, weird ad blocking screen","I‚Äôm not sure how this has gotten such good reviews!  From the very beginning, there was a lot of pressure to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äú, with even a warning of it this will be the ‚Äúonly time‚Äù I can upgrade, with a full screen countdown clock?  10,9,8...what?  Of course I said no, and it ends up that the features they were trying to get me to pay for, are already on the app such as your A-1 C average level?  I wanted to enter previous data from the last month but that became too difficult in this app.  When you are entering the information, they have a tag that you can say before breakfast or before lunch etc.  but then they don‚Äôt have a separate area to add food.  Even though I might be entering my fasting blood sugar level, they make you add the food on that page?  So in that entry you have to look hard to understand that I ate that breakfast AFTER I took my level.   Also after entering about four numbers, this ad began to block the view and then when you click the X to close it,  it would open it.  That happened a few times, and I quickly deleted the app!!! Never had anything like this on an app!"
4,4,1,2018-01-03T19:08:06.000Z,Dissappointed99,I Used To Love This App,"I have used Glucose Buddy for several years and loved it!  It was so helpful to me, that I shared it with my diabetic health care team, in hopes they could let other patients no how it helped me.   That is no longer the case!  Version 5 of Glucose Buddy was released during the fall of 2017 and the App (in my opinion) was ruined.  First,  the data entry screen no longer fits on the screen of my mobile device.  Some of the selections are barely visible.  Second are the incessant and annoying pop-up ads that make viewing the App‚Äôs screens very difficult.  Finally are the high pressure ads to subscribe to the premium version of Glucose Buddy for a fee of $60 per year.   Many of the most helpful features of Glucose Buddy are only available with a premium subscription, which I‚Äôm unwilling to pay.   If you ignore the reviews of the pre-version 5 Glucose Buddy you can see the ratings drop from 4 & 5 stars to 1, 2 & 3 stars.  (check for your self)"
5,5,4,2017-11-15T02:40:18.000Z,Kenrit,GB Improvements,"Great App, simple and easy to use, great way to keep track of blood sugar readings in an easily understandably format.  Plus can email results directly to Dr, cutting down on time consuming expensive visits.  Only two things keeps it from a Five Star Rating, wish would add capability for two separate accounts, so could keep track of my wife's readings all in one App, and it's a small nitpicking thing, wish you would add another ""Fasting"" category with it's own color.  My Dr is mainly interested in my ""Fasting"" readings, and I can only list ""Out of Bed"" or ""Before Breakfast"", which show up with the same colors as ""Other"" or ""Before Meals"", causing some confusion and time consuming research to separate them.   Add those capabilities, and you've really got a winner."
6,6,2,2020-01-11T21:46:34.000Z,Tom Estlack,OK but user interface is terrible,"The app is great overall. They use a data collection strategy to get users hooked on the practicality of the product. Then when you try to use advanced features or download the data you entered, you have to pay for it. So I guess that works pretty well for them..."
7,7,5,2019-03-09T16:07:31.000Z,JCruz2279,"One Stop Shopping, Kinda",2 days in and great app so far. I‚Äôm a visual person so graphs and images resonate and sometimes inspire me.
8,8,1,2019-12-16T23:29:19.000Z,MetalMMAMonkey,Still Ads and No Support,"Not even counting the limitations on adding meals. Paid for ad free version to use, one year. Constantly get a pop up asking me if I want to purchase the app for a discount for a limited time that then disappears shortly after. Trying to add A1C to average, but apparently there is no support. When I try to access support from app it asks me to try something else for free it takes me to a sales force site where I can pay for something? Did they mess up a plug in for their app and it‚Äôs for their company or what happened? Try to access support from App Store and it takes me to a site saying it‚Äôs not found. Going to find alternative and cancel subscription."
9,9,1,2020-02-04T03:49:46.000Z,jwhoberry1123,Difficult to receive support,"I was initially excited to have this app because it seemed to have it all! Exercise log, data sync, nutrition, weight management, etc. I was most excited to have the ability to sync my Dexcom! I made the premium purchase and.... have yet to have my Dexcom sync. I have tried several times and nothing each time. I attempted to find support for this issue. Stuff happens right? I attempted to get support through the app and revive an error via that way and then tried via the website and am prompted to purchase or have two weeks free of another application in order to receive support for it. I have tried several times to receive support and I have not been able to do so. It has rendered the application and premium purchase completely useless to me."
10,10,1,2018-05-06T16:22:52.000Z,Usually Pretty Frazzled,There is a Big Difference Between Paying for Something of that is Well Made & Being Extorted,"I couldn‚Äôt agree with MommaHippi more.  This app used to be something special. Something I would have paid for because it was worth it back then. But I wasn‚Äôt asked. I wasn‚Äôt warned. The app was just suddenly changed, and I discovered that if I wanted my information I would be charged a substantially large fee for it.  I‚Äôve given the new app a chance, but find myself becoming upset when I try to use it.  Now it‚Äôs just like all the other apps that do the same thing - but the interface is ugly and confusing.   Developers do this to themselves and their customers a lot these days. It must be profitable. I‚Äôm going back to paper and pencil."
11,11,5,2018-12-28T15:03:41.000Z,Amytincan,Simple and well worth it,"I have never written a review before for an app.   I held out on paying for the upgraded price because $ you know, but it got a bit hard using multiple free apps to track health things. I tried several extensively and while others may look more fun, this app does what I need it to do.   It‚Äôs very easy using the app to track the things I need.    If I want to track more things it has the capability.   I can track less if I want.   I don‚Äôt like having to track but this app makes it easier."
12,12,5,2020-05-14T15:43:33.000Z,mikemartines,Great app ‚Äî no bugs,"I‚Äôve been using the app for over a year and haven‚Äôt had any major issues with it. It‚Äôs stable and helpful. I do wish it provided more analytical data capability, but it is good for tracking carbs it even recognizes food when you take a picture. It has recognized every barcoded item I‚Äôve tried and lets you reuse items you‚Äôve already scanned and even input your own recipes. It can always use more enhancements like the data analyzing capability I mentioned and a better recipe building capability and salad or sandwich building capability."

14,14,2,2021-06-29T02:24:42.000Z,Don'thaveonenottaken,Not happy,"I decided to pay this high amount for the app because it seemed to have everything I was looking for, including nutrition information like how much fat etc I consumed in my day besides the food diary."
15,15,1,2020-03-10T10:00:35.000Z,billfla,Find something else,This would be a good app.  I paid for the full version about a year ago.  They made some improvements after making some errors. But STOP trying to sell me stuff.  I paid for the app!
16,16,5,2021-07-29T10:11:55.000Z,Zen the Ducky,People are funny - especially me!,"I really like this app. I loved the old insights and when it was updated I was mad. Couldn't stand the new insights. So they put the old one back because I‚Äôm guessing many others breathed fire and brimstone on the development team. Well now after reverting, I think I preferred the new interface! Maybe adding the older charting to the new interface as an extra would resolve many issues. I wonder how many people actually experienced this change. Anyway. Thumbs up to the development team."
17,17,5,2021-05-16T12:08:59.000Z,Queen Mama K,Glucose Buddy has made a difference in my life.,"Over the last two years, I have been using the FreeStyle LibraLink sensor to check my blood sugar. I knew my blood sugar was out of control but did not know how to manage it.  In February 2021, I discovered Glucose Buddy. This program has made a huge difference for me.  When I started using it my A1 C was 6.6. It is now 6.3. Other benefits are  that I have lost weight and my meds have been reduced. ..all from using Glucose Buddy.  Overall, I feel so much better.  Using this program is easy.   It is life changing."
18,18,5,2021-04-21T19:32:53.000Z,Sugarbaby Mom,LOVE this App!,"We recently went back to injections after being on a pump for 7 years. I had forgotten how much info there is to keep track of when you‚Äôre doing it without technology! We tried a different app and hated it. Love this one because of the reports, they help me see trends without having to use a CGM, that I can add all her different meds and track her glucose, carb intake, activity and insulin usage. The only thing that could possibly make this better would be if I could enter her ratios for figuring her insulin and correction factor."
19,19,5,2019-08-31T13:03:49.000Z,GrandmaChristine,Great App!!!,"I started using this app in February 2019. My A1C at the time was 8.6 and my proteins were over 600. I started tracking everything with this app and A1C is 6.8, protein is at 30, and I have lost 30 pounds. I went from 55 units of insulin to 30. Saw my Dr yesterday and she said drop to 25 units. When I go to the Dr. she can see all me glucose readings for the month. I love that with a few clicks she can see blood pressure readings, steps, or anything else this app tracks. I recommend this app to everyone I meet with diabetes. It was well worth the money!!"
20,20,5,2017-10-08T22:30:46.000Z,llaurie,Love Glucose Buddy!,"For now, I am only using the glucose recording function of this app because I use another app that tracks everything else.  I love that it keeps track of my averages for me. It keeps me in line better when I not only have to test my blood sugar, but then I have to enter it into glucose buddy ‚Äì ‚Äì makes it more realistic than just looking at the number on my meter and turning it off.  I highly recommend getting this app."
21,21,1,2017-11-16T15:39:37.000Z,I'm gone...,More than I need or want,"I‚Äôve used this app for quite awhile. It had a straightforward interface and feature set. The recent major upgrade of this app brought with it a lot of additional features, a major overhaul of the UI and sharing functionalities. All I need is an app that lets me record my blood glucose. I can‚Äôt imagine why I would ever share that with anyone! I don‚Äôt find the new overcomplicated UI to be an improvement either. The continued pop-ups asked how I like the app are really annoying, as are the overemphasized messages complaining that I don‚Äôt have location or sharing enabled. So, I‚Äôve switched to an app that is simple and uncluttered with a swollen feature set. Sorry this app got so ‚Äúimproved‚Äù."
22,22,1,2018-04-02T12:56:50.000Z,BarelyToleratingComputers,Not a useful app for the high price,Expensive subscription. Must pay to see what the app really offers. Why pay if I don‚Äôt know what I am paying for? What I see in the free app sure isn‚Äôt encouraging.
23,23,4,2018-04-03T05:14:46.000Z,narcolepticnurse,Very handy app :),I do actually love this app. Makes it easy to remember and store blood sugars and spot trends in highs and lows.

25,25,3,2020-06-06T15:06:55.000Z,Awc2222,Pricey Subscription for Features that Lock Up,"Overall, this app is crucial to me for tracking foods and blood glucose. The issues, though are frustrating. I find the app locking up in various features. I chose to pay for the monthly subscription so that I could utilize more tools that would benefit me most (more recipes instead of maximum of 5, quick add foods, filter searching). I am disappointed by the number of bugs that freeze the app, namely attempting to filter my Log to only display Blood Glucose. Considering I paid specifically hoping to use that feature, I would like to be able to use it!!!"
26,26,1,2020-09-23T23:10:51.000Z,20932120123,Confusing interface,"The app really pushes upgrading to premium, to the max! I tried it but deleted it after struggling inputting information and then looking for food information. The records are not completely editable. There is no way to select food types and get your nutritional information. It says take a photo. Are you kidding me? I know what I ate! The app pushes a lot of costly educational materials. If I was new to diabetes I would be sucked in. But I am not. Just need a simple application to track sugar, meds, and meals in a understandable less then 100 page report for my doctor. What doctor has time to look at a huge daily report that it generates? To much useless add-ones. Deleted it after trying it two times."
27,27,2,2021-06-11T11:17:44.000Z,JimkVT,Glitch,"I have my ReliOn Premium BLU meter linked to my app. The time settings are correct in the app and on my iPhone, yet when ever I take a reading, it transmits via Bluetooth with a time stamp 6 hours earlier than the actual time. I have to manually correct the time for every reading I take. Very frustrating. When I tried to report the issue on the app an error pops up saying that it can‚Äôt send emails and to check my settings. So I am having a hard time getting any support. Does anyone know of another app that I can link my meter to and also record daily medication and things like weight, diet?  I‚Äôm open to suggestions. Thanks."
28,28,4,2019-07-17T13:22:42.000Z,sbukosky,Better than My Plate,"I understand that the Live Strong My Plate app has a different purpose and it served me well. I lost 70 pounds using it. But it does little to nothing to aid with diabetes control. I like how GB works, for the most part. I am educating myself other ways too, but I consider the app a must have. I bought the upgrade and am a few meals away from a report. I‚Äôd like to see a community or user group section for support. That and some other minor things prevent a five star rating. I give it a 4.1."
29,29,3,2021-07-10T22:11:20.000Z,Mderooi,Lacks information,"I really want to use this app for the information that I want to keep track of, but the time of recording is wrong most of the time. I purchased a years subscription and not sure that the subscription is worth it."
30,30,5,2017-09-23T22:37:34.000Z,lmrad2,Dislike the update!,"The old version was simple, I loved it. The newest update is totally different and now I'm looking for a new app in which to log my daily glucose levels. I don't want all the ""extras"" plus for some reason I'm unable to receive log reports sent to any of my email accounts. I agree with every other negative review regarding the recent update. This went from a 5 star to a 1 star overnight."

I see no reason readings can‚Äôt be stored locally and reported from there."
33,33,5,2018-07-12T12:25:49.000Z,Diabetic Supporter,Awesome App,A loved ones A1C was out of control so I loaded this app on his phone as a device for him to track his carbs but this app is so much more. He can log his activity and it tells him his caloric intake and output. With subscription it tracks his A1C levels which is what we need in this critical time. This app keeps it organized-all in one app. I joined as support to cheer him on and can see his progress as a friend. I highly recommend. Great motivational tool.
34,34,3,2018-12-19T04:25:42.000Z,Scottnj1966,Pretty good app but it has its problems,After using the app for a few months I have enjoyed all it can do but after reading the reviews of what they app could do compared to what it cannot do now is a big change.

It still shows I‚Äôm subscribed but I can‚Äôt do reports or see my a1c estimate. Contacting customer support is not easy as I‚Äôve been met with links going to non-existent pages or customer contact pages that don‚Äôt work.

Every time I say ‚Äúno‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt ever remember and asks again. I change my dosage depending on my blood sugar, and while I sometimes have 2 or 3 days of the same, it is not an all the time the same thing. If it were, I would not need an ap to track it!"

Seeing my numbers over time and trending makes a difference. The graphs, timeline and printing out for my doctors are the features I like best. Yes, I have tried others before finding Glucose Buddy. They discouraged me and actually delayed my progress. Glucose Buddy has become My Buddy."

My only disappointment is with these two Azumio apps, Glucose Buddy and Argus. They each display multiple read outs on my weight. Instead of listing my weight once as expected, it will show it 3-4 times on every day readings are taken. I‚Äôve reported it via the App Store, but no remedy after many months. I wonder why?"

41,41,2,2018-04-13T14:23:49.000Z,BlickTX,"Sorry, but it does too much.","I‚Äôm leaving Glucose Buddy because it has become a hovering nanny that needs to be paid to leave me alone to simply record my blood sugar. I brought my levels down for two years, but an illness and steroids shot it back up. I need to track for at least a month - just glucose, not food, exercise, contact friends, post on social media - and this hovering/selfie-ad infested app just doesn‚Äôt do it. If a nanny is needed, this app will fill the bill and for just a few dollars a month all the things I don‚Äôt need/want are available."
42,42,5,2018-06-04T15:40:29.000Z,Bethwa,GB,"The only downside to this app is that the suggested A1c was 10 points off what my actual A1c was, unless you are constantly monitoring it, it‚Äôs not going to be accurate  so I‚Äôd recommend that be removed. Otherwise this app makes it easy to track , I use 2 different meters so this pulls it all into one spot. Like that you can add pictures and notes"
43,43,3,2018-11-27T05:09:54.000Z,Prettyjs22,First time user,"Was looking for an app that would track my carbs and my glucose. Was excited to find this one. Unfortunately it won‚Äôt work unless I want to pay. I‚Äôve searched several items I had at meals today and did not locate them. Yes I could add them, but only the name and calories....if I wanted to add the other info I‚Äôd need to upgrade to premium.  I guess I‚Äôll just have to stay with the 2 free apps I use right now to track food in one and glucose in the other."
44,44,3,2021-02-21T15:26:32.000Z,Sugilite,Premium version still includes ads,"I would have given this app 5 stars if it only tracked my numbers. But it constantly nags you to add additional services to your account, and continues to throw ads in your face. I‚Äôve used the app for the past 3 years and I‚Äôm getting more and more annoyed with it. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what it costs, something like $30 per year. But for that kind of money, you would think that you would receive an ad free version. Today it wanted to sell me a scale."

47,47,4,2020-12-23T13:51:18.000Z,Jake 1010MD,Almost there,"I used the program be for I purchased the premium versions. Price and features almost caused me to abandon this series. It is very pricey but the premium features are good. It is a complete program and record keeper. There needs to be a better free version and the pricing structure versus features/functions ratio. However it is still one of the most complete system on the market, but more interoperability people be nice."

50,50,3,2017-10-28T15:49:07.000Z,Pokerface15218,High Pressure Sales to buy premium,From the very second I logged into this for the first time the application became nothing but pressure sales to get me to buy their premium login ‚Äúthe premium version‚Äù. There was even a 22nd last chance pitch to get me to upgrade to the premium for ever even let me onto the application. I deleted the app when the 20 second countdown was done. If that‚Äôs the way they greet the customers then i don't want to be one of the customers
51,51,2,2017-11-21T17:06:31.000Z,Somerset PA,New change,Since the new update I no longer use this app as much as I used to.  You can no longer see your logs displayed in such a way as to easily view or compare them like before. Adding an entry is no longer an easy task and there are now more steps to go through in order to log or find logs. I like the new look but I prefer something that works well regardless of how esthetically pleasing it is. I do wish they would change that part back.
52,52,2,2017-11-27T13:24:37.000Z,Goldrrt,Time to say goodbye,"Not a fan of the this updated version with the new company. Prior to this it was very easy to filter results and at one point I was even able to add a custom tag. Now one has to upgrade to the premium version to filter results! Seriously?!!!? The ability to apply a filter to my results should be a basic feature especially with the new look.  It‚Äôs not user friendly to be able to find your results. Bye, bye old friend. Time to find a new app."

I click on the ‚ÄòX‚Äô to hide the ad and it took me to the upgrade page EVERY TIME. I‚Äôve spent the last 15 minutes trying to find an email address to request they delete my info since I have deleted their app. Still cannot find an address. If I start getting email junk to buy or try glucose monitoring items, I‚Äôll know where it started. Ugh!!!!!!!!"
54,54,5,2018-09-01T20:32:51.000Z,Lydiabv,Great App!,"I was looking for a new Diabetes App, as the In Check Diabetes App which I was using is being discontinued.  I found great reviews about Glucose Buddy.  I decided to try it out.  I have been using it for a week and absolutely love the ease of the App!  It has proven better than what I was using and more features to it.  Definitely recommend Glucose Buddy!!!"
55,55,4,2019-04-02T16:29:41.000Z,Summersgirl3,I like this app.,It‚Äôs easy to use and carry my glucose readings to my doctor appointments. I also like the estimated A1C. It helps keep me on track with my carb intake.

Like the estimated A1c calculation. It has tracked closely with testing. Good integration with the Health App. I don‚Äôt like the subscription model, but like the no ads, and realize the developer must eat. Keep up the support."
57,57,1,2021-05-21T13:56:15.000Z,DChainmaster,Always trying to push or trick you into buying things.,"This used to be a good app and then they changed and now keep hitting you constantly with offers for upgrades and more paying services, some of which you can‚Äôt avoid.  Once you‚Äôve logged in a bunch of readings, you can‚Äôt download or print out report for your doctor unless you pay.  If you don‚Äôt pay, then you have to write down your readings to provide to doctor.  I‚Äôm leaving to find an app that doesn‚Äôt lock your information down unless you pay money."
58,58,1,2020-01-05T22:25:22.000Z,SnoopyDJR,Disappointed,"So I download Glucose Buddy (free) and start setting up. In settings I sync, or try to, the Health data and the app never, recovers. I see it spinning next to the network icon. Close the app and reopen, no response from the app. Delete the app. Buy the $1.99 app and try the same thing. Sync Health and the app freezes. It‚Äôs only $2 bucks but come on, really. Your app does not work and won‚Äôt come out of the sync spin. Then the app blows up. I tried to use the contact from the Glucose Buddy site but that doesn‚Äôt work either. Disappointed."

I do not want to pay $40 or more for a Premium. I do not care for the incessant push to subscribe.  I‚Äôll probably look for an alternative if this pushing continues.  It‚Äôs distracting, interrupting, and very annoying.  You asked, I said no but it persists.  I know such premium accounts end up being more and more opportunities to shell out payments for more and more."

I only thing I‚Äôm disappointed about is the latest update that changed to way information is entered. No happy about it, but it WON‚ÄôT deter me from using this wonderful app. I give it a 4.8."
66,66,1,2019-10-31T19:54:38.000Z,ColonelPanik,Login? No thanks.,Why do I need to login or setup an account to use the app? Nope nope nope. Never going to allow any health related app make me ‚Äúcreate an account‚Äù. This app is even worse: doesn‚Äôt even tell you WHY you need to create an account. Just wants you to set it up before you can even see what‚Äôs inside. Deleted.
67,67,2,2019-09-02T14:10:15.000Z,Radiate77,Not Getting Better,"I have used this app for several years even paying extra for the deluxe version.

68,68,1,2019-10-16T18:24:48.000Z,sginn78,Sorry,"I wish to god I would have used this app for a bit before purchasing the yearly subscription. Biggest problem is when you scan a food it shows everything there. When you go to insights and pull it up all line items are zeroed our. Then if you switch the serving it goes completely whacko. For example it listed something that should be 140 calories as 14,000 calories. The only way I can make it get even close to accurate is if I switch serving size to between .04 and .05."
69,69,1,2021-04-09T11:54:22.000Z,Den bar,Money hungry,"I didn‚Äôt even finish setting up the app to get started. The app kept asking... well more like insisting, that I subscribe. Apparently the programmer(s) don‚Äôt have enough confidence in their app to inspire people to want the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù so they feel the need to brow beat you into upgrading prior to even using it. If they don‚Äôt have confidence in it, why should I? I deleted it.  For the other programmers out there, don‚Äôt nag potential customers. Let them try your app. If they like it and see the benefit of upgrading, they‚Äôll do so."

I have not heard back from support... if you are going to charge 59+ dollars, should have been better tested."
71,71,5,2017-12-10T08:01:37.000Z,Ms fixit,Live with this app!,My husband and I have used this app for years. It‚Äôs so convenient and easy to use. My doctor loves it too. All he has to do is look on our phones to monitor our blood glucose history. It on takes seconds to record your numbers and you‚Äôre done!

Every now and again I can add in my weight. I wish the food thing had more already put in items - not brands - just items. Maybe it does, I just haven‚Äôt found it or it wasn‚Äôt evident. So basically haven‚Äôt had any directions and I just use it to log."
73,73,5,2018-12-28T13:09:56.000Z,Janice412,Love this app.,"I've told everyone I know about this app. I was so overwhelmed when I was diagnosed with diabetes. After a couple of weeks of trying to figure things out manually, I discovered Glucose Buddy. I can't imagine tracking my diabetes without it now. Been using it for 3 1/2 months."

I‚Äôve learned to portion my meals, average out my blood sugar and pressure and share everything with my doctor. This app is well worth it!

75,75,4,2021-03-07T22:43:37.000Z,Dionysius100,Good for me.,"Glucose buddy works good for me. I do have an issue when trying to put in two slices of bread or two eggs, sometimes it will glitch and I have to go out. And then end up putting the bread in twice in the eggs in twice. Not a big deal, but a glitch in the program. I love the ability to scan barcodes. Best way to input data."
76,76,4,2020-07-10T12:39:34.000Z,5Kubs,App not working,I have been using this app for a while and it‚Äôs been great. I decided to upgrade so I could all the features. Once the trial was over and they received the payment for the year it stopped working I can‚Äôt get it to open. I click the app help and it says page not found. So disappointed.
77,77,5,2019-09-24T09:37:26.000Z,Paulina224,Old version,Is there any way to use the previous version? I liked being able to put glucose level and medicine in one screen without having to switch between items
78,78,1,2020-11-08T20:15:56.000Z,Claraluz61,Way too nosy,"I used to use this app and it was simple and met my need, which was to track my glucose level.  Now it is way too aggressive about wanting you to buy the premium version and to connect you to other apps ( like Apple health).  They want direct access to your glucometer. And they want to know your weight, diet, etc.  Basically, they want to get your money and then sell as much information about you as possible.  No, thanks.  I think I‚Äôll just buy some graph paper."
79,79,1,2019-12-30T00:18:50.000Z,Ljm81,Shameless advertising and warped Apple rating system,"When companies focus more on annoying me into buying their product instead of providing value to me, I go elsewhere."

Now I have a way to track my blood sugars throughout the day and get periodic reports that help me to check how I‚Äôm doing, along with my A1 C score. It‚Äôs also helpful to take to the doctors office of the doctor can see it as well."
81,81,5,2018-05-05T11:09:15.000Z,salad girl,Maybe I‚Äôm just old,Liked it better before they changed to subscription .  The app still lets me chart my glucose which is why I use it.  Don‚Äôt know why they want my location that‚Äôs not why I use the map and don‚Äôt need s drain on my battery life .

Please fix this bug as soon as possible. Thanks."
83,83,2,2019-01-05T01:11:36.000Z,Ellzo7,Needs Recipe Entry,This would be an complete package app for diabetes if it didn‚Äôt just use AI food tracking but also allowed for recipe storage like MyFitnessPal and other health apps so I can have the most accurate log of what I am consuming by indicating how many servings I‚Äôm having of that meal. This app isn‚Äôt truly complete without that capability. I‚Äôm better off just using my Dexcom and MyFitness Pal at this point. Please consider adding this feature.

I was able to use this app for the past 48 hours. I logged my blood sugar this morning and now I cannot open the app. It keeps crashing. I tried reinstalling the app but that hasn‚Äôt helped. Thanks god the app info backed up to the website. I‚Äôll have to switch to another app now to keep tracking. I‚Äôm disappointed as I like a lot of the features of this app.

The first thing it does is pop up a screen asking me to pay 50 dollars. If I cancel this, it goes to an ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù page. Cancelling this brings you back to the ‚Äúpay 50 dollars page.‚Äù There is apparently no way to use this app without forking over 50 bucks up front. I wish I could have back the 10 minutes I wasted on this thing."
88,88,5,2019-09-06T23:53:05.000Z,jogeno4340,Trouble saving medicine,Since the new upgrade it won‚Äôt save my medicine. Where you are supposed to enter the dosage the screen goes back to the list of medicine. It won‚Äôt stay on the screen to enter dosage and doesn‚Äôt show on my daily data.
89,89,1,2020-08-02T19:26:50.000Z,Bizeeone,Difficult to use,I end up with multiple photos of the same entry. When I enter Snacks it insists it is breakfast depending on the time. Won‚Äôt reflect the change. I can‚Äôt believe this gets a 4.8 rating. Support is nonexistent. People complain about being charged without agreement. The website has 10 articles to help. No tutorial. A1C is way off. GB calculates it to be 4.9 and lab testing was 5.9. Big difference whether normal or not. Requesting a refund based on function. Doesn‚Äôt work.
90,90,5,2017-11-14T22:36:35.000Z,idahobirdhunter,Great Ap!,I have been using it for 6 months. Especially like the feature that allows me to scan barcodes on foods that I can‚Äôt find in list. My doctor was impressed!  She spent a lot of time. Looking at the reports.
91,91,3,2017-12-01T19:37:37.000Z,Cizzarries,Was great...Don't like it now,"This was a great little app that I used for a couple of years here.  Then they did a ""New And Improved.""   Now there's so much crap in it that it's a pain to just use to chart your readings any more."
92,92,1,2018-02-04T21:56:00.000Z,Dede146,Disappointed in Update!,"This app use to be so easy to use. Now I struggle with the size and changes. Also the updated version bombards you with ads. On top of it all, it wants you to share your disease with your friends. How stupid is that. My medical problems are private and not to be public. Also, I have an Apple Watch and it doesn‚Äôt pick up the exercise I do. I will definitely change apps as soon as I find one that works well with my lifestyle."
93,93,3,2018-08-24T13:25:19.000Z,GamerHack149,Just Ok,Interface is a bit crowded and confusing. Reports seem buggy.  When viewed in app report doesn‚Äôt show all tags.  When report is emailed (as a link) it only shows one day of data.  The reports are what I‚Äôm most interested in.  The app has many features but it can be difficult to navigate between them.
94,94,5,2018-08-29T14:26:07.000Z,crowell0306,Easy to use and share with doctors,I track my reading and all my meds. It‚Äôs easy to print reports for my doctor and I can also just show the info from my phone. I also like that it gives my average A1C.
95,95,4,2018-09-17T00:59:56.000Z,Melrn0625,Good but lacking activity sync,I really like this app and use it often for my diabetic patients but it does not connect with my Apple Watch or iPhone health app well enough to completely track my activity and steps. Not as many food choices as my fitness pal. I love the automatic run start on the azumio app.
96,96,5,2018-09-28T17:34:45.000Z,NSGLex,A great way to record my intake,With this app I count my calories and keep track of what I ate and what I haven‚Äôt ate. It‚Äôs reassuring that I have a record of food intake. So for example I‚Äôve been looking at my record and I realize I haven‚Äôt ate spinach in a while then I make some spinach.
97,97,5,2020-02-11T11:22:24.000Z,chelseapug48,Saving medication,The ability to save medication doses in the last update is great except for one thing.  I no longer have access to the decimal point so my medication can‚Äôt be entered correctly. Can you please fix that?
98,98,2,2019-09-02T14:09:09.000Z,X720X,Glucose Buddy review,"Please give option to revert back to the previous Glucose Buddy tracking. After the update, mine logs entries using incorrect times. It‚Äôs now double the work. And if it logs times incorrectly, monitoring blood, taking meds, can be detrimental. Please revert back to previous. This new system is less than user friendly and is not what I paid for. I paid for the ease of use with the other version."
99,99,1,2019-09-05T11:49:11.000Z,Zelda Joy,Change the update!!!!,"I have to use another app since your app is not working - my doctor is reducing my meds because I‚Äôve been tracking my T2 diabetes using your app. I have not been able to log in the number of units of bolus and basal insulin, so I cannot track my food with my insulin. Please change the app functionality back to what it was. The UI is MUCH more difficult to figure out, especially due to the fact that it is not working."

101,101,2,2018-05-10T17:16:41.000Z,dtregay,"Mostly great, but...","I mostly love the way it looks and functions. If I only needed it to enter glucose results (and I never had to edit an entry) I would give it 5 stars. But dates in general seem to be an issue. When I add a meal, it doesn‚Äôt allow me to set the entry time. It appears to use the time from the last entry of the same food. But when I edit the entry it shows a completely different time."

Just recently acquired this app to monitor my sugar since beginning my Ketogenic diet. It‚Äôs helped me get off my diabetes meds and monitor my course to a better health
104,104,1,2018-10-02T13:42:55.000Z,Shan Viv,Basics aren‚Äôt great,"Too much going on in this app and the basics don‚Äôt function correctly. Each time I entered my glucose, the app would add a duplicate record. Sometimes it would be set to public instead of private. The dupe never had the timing notes attached to it, which made it easy to delete. All of the dupes I deleted eventually made their way back. Also would enter info (weight, steps) from other apps multiple times. Not recommended."

Then it changed to the subscription mode and became too buggy. Popup ads, simple info input became hard, pressing saved button diverts to inappropriate websites. Posted numbers were changed on saved. Steps no longer saved on correct days. No longer able to sync info between devices. Looking for replacement app."
107,107,5,2019-11-05T13:06:55.000Z,ElsieWinkle,Making It Easy,Keeping track is easy with this app. I look forward to watching my progress and seeing where I make not the best food choices and how that offsets the glucose level. My dietician loves it too!

However, the choices in the curve (glucose, A1c, food, activity, etc) are somewhat out of the field.  They need to be closer together & within the field so that one of the choices can be selected."

Have been trying other apps and learning more options without paying; have found other apps more useful. Unsure why the app options that are most pertinent are only available for an ungodly fee. Unless fee decreases, I will be utilizing the other app."
122,122,1,2018-08-04T11:55:00.000Z,ScottAustinSmith,This app is super buggy,"I have reported this bug to app support but I had no reply. When I log an event, I always take a photo of my insulin pump screen for reference. Often, that photo is lost. Also, the time of the event often automatically switches to early in the morning. These bugs are super simple to fix, but the app is pretty useless until they fix them. I told the app support folks I am willing to help, yet no contact."

The screens are so filled with ads that it‚Äôs hard to actually see much of your own data. The paid version is WAY too expensive for what you get ($14+/month?!).  I will continue looking for an alternative."

148,148,1,2020-11-29T05:07:57.000Z,ehhh bye,Stopped using,I decided to try this app because it had more downloads but i hate it. When I logged my food in it would always log it in as separate meals and i had to always fix it. It doesn‚Äôt give you the option for med reminders which i really need or to check my sugar. It really pushes you to upgrade. The only okay thing was it tracked my steps.
149,149,4,2020-03-07T15:11:49.000Z,I got mine!,Great app,This app is great for tracking my blood sugars and blood pressure. It‚Äôs lacking the basic counters for calories and carbohydrates. If you want to pay for them you can but it should be included! That‚Äôs why I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars.

342,342,5,2018-07-07T19:25:50.000Z,McMeggieMac,Glucose Buddy made a scary situation easy.,"Four times a day this app is a welcomed source of continuity, inspiration and a desire to learn more about diabetes. This is the ONLY thing that has been easy from the first second I opened the app. May 2018, my 76yo Mom was at the ER. She didn‚Äôt know my name, mumbled and had major balance issues. It wasn‚Äôt a stroke but the result of her poorly managed T2D. After three weeks split between hospital and a rehab facility, we were back at the ER due to another episode. She was released 3am on Memorial Day with no access to her GP nor regular pharmacy, with confusing/ conflicting scripts for 3 types of insulin, new meds, and a freaked out daughter pretending to be calm. Desperate for an app that would help me, I found this one. The reviews and easy to comprehend screen shots sold me. Even negative or less than stellar reviews seemed to be constructive and many had replies. During this new journey with my Mom, this is the ONLY thing that has been easy. Having no clue what basal or bolus was, I entered her Humalog insulin and began recording. As things settled down and a routine was established, I decided to pay the yearly subscription and dug deeper into what this app offered. Our GP was now on vacation but called and wanted to see Mom‚Äôs glucose levels. Mom was prepared to write it all out in an email and was relieved when I simply sent a report from the app. Our GP was relieved and impressed. We‚Äôve since talked more about the app and both like how the simplicity of entering items on the patient‚Äôs side doesn‚Äôt detract from the detailed report that he as a doctor reads. As I now know what basal and bolus mean, I was able to go back and easily edit previous entries. The more we use this app, the more we are inspired to learn new ways to live with diabetes. This app is now on Mom‚Äôs iPhone in addition to mine. She is actively becoming more involved in entering her own information and even prepping and using her glucometer. Glucose Buddy has given her tools and a sense of feeling in control. As she gets three shots of Humalog a day and now uses a Lantus pen at night, this app has helped to establish a routine that has inspired new eating habits. She even carries her iPhone more now than before so she can record her steps. It‚Äôs a win win for everyone! We‚Äôre all enjoying a healthier Mom that wants to use her iPhone and has it with her for calls and FaceTiming. Thank you!!!"

480,480,2,2008-12-08T06:36:42.000Z,Hervie123,"all looks, no substance.","This is the first negative review I write, preferring instead to contact the developer (being one myself).  But there is no excuse to charging $5.99 for a clearly half baked app.  Money which I just wasted and could have spent instead on diamedic, a competing app done much better.   And no I don't work for the competition.  You can check my other reviews for products such as weightbot and mSecure."
481,481,5,2008-12-28T07:43:18.000Z,A1C Champion,Almost perfect,"Just to preface this - I have had type II diabetes for 20 years.  For the past four years I have been on insulin to control my diabetes.  I have also been running a Palm application to keep a log of my blood sugars and, carb intake, insulin use, etc.  Given the age of the Palm, an iPod touch seemed to be a good choice to replace it."
482,482,5,2009-11-20T02:38:55.000Z,birdlover11,Love this program,"Diabetes is tough, but Glucose Buddy 3.0 makes keeping track of the details easier. I've been using GB since version 1.0. It continues to improve and grow. Support is excellent and they listen to ideas and fix any issues. The new version allows you to choose more than one food or medication at a time. The application also loads faster than before. Now you can enter a numeric value for your glucose reading instead of rotating a dial. Adding entries is quick and easy. The log file has changed and is wider so the different colors for meds, food, activity and glucose do not show and the sorting capability is gone. Being able to sort the different types was very useful to me so I hope they add that back. While the graphs were removed this version, to me the more useful graphs are online. Putting the buttons on the bottom and having the application open to the log screen would also be good. I highly recommend this application. They are always working on improvements and it's still free. Thanks GB!"
483,483,5,2010-03-18T20:20:22.000Z,Type 2 Diabetic,This app is great,"I am using the reminders functon and the log.  Setup was simple, easy to understand and fast.  The push reminder function is excellent.  I had considered purchasing a seperate app for that purpose and no longer need to."
484,484,5,2011-02-08T05:29:10.000Z,RooneyR,Great App! Happy to Have Sync!,"I had reviewed an earlier version, and just got the new update and bought the 2-way sync. Had a few problems getting it going, but the developers were instantly responsive on their website forum and it's all working great now. Yep, it's pricey, but as I rely on my iPad more and more, I 'm glad to have all my records both there and on my iPhone. Also, I didn't understand the reviewer who said you can't go back and enter older records. Yes you can. I entered months of records, and update my BG numbers every several days."
485,485,5,2011-03-10T12:46:30.000Z,BlueWaterSailing,Easy and Flexible with Exceptional Data Interpretation...The Best!,"Congratulations on the development of a wonderful, easy-to-use, complete tracking program for those of us with Diabetes.  I have been using Glucose Buddy for nearly 4 months now and I wanted to take a moment to say how much I appreciate the application.   I am an analytical person that would enter my data into an excel spreadsheet each week and run a variety of plots to identify trends, look for opportunities to improve my control, and simply do a better job of understanding my bodies ability to accommodate sugar.  Sure there were lots of programs to record data but those were very weak with respect to analysis."
486,486,5,2012-10-05T13:04:44.000Z,fastattk,The Best and Effective So Far,"As a newly diagnosed Type 2 I was very much concerned and interested in finding just the ideal app that would let me log my data, show me results immediately and something I could share with my Doctor at each visit.  I believe I've found it!  This app is not only user friendly but let's me visually see my results.  I especially like the graphs, the entries are easy to use and I can take a snapshot of my progress anytime.  The ""topper"" was the website and how I can access it from any computer and I can sync it with my IPhone!  One drawback that I can not award five stars is that my web entries do not sync to my IPhone but I can sync my IPhone logs to the website no problem.  That is confusing and lack of info when I want to share my data with my Doctor via my IPhone.  Log data on website does not match log data on IPhone.  On the biggest upside to this entire package is that it is all free both the IPhone app and membership to the corresponding site!  Free is good and this app is as well.  I will be looking for further updates, I really love this app!!"
487,487,1,2014-08-21T23:15:30.000Z,BunnyDad,Was a great app. Now just ok and no support,"Update #2: really disappointed in the support. Have been unable to sync the data between phone and computer. No way to back up data to the server. Has been like this for months. No response from app developer. It has good/easy user interface, but unless can back up and send reports to my doctor it has become worthless. Deleting the app."
488,488,5,2014-09-20T13:41:23.000Z,Astron7,Great helper,"Update: 20 Sept. 2014. I have changed my rating from a one to a four as they seem to have finally fixed the issue where the data synching would fail for weeks at a time. For about the past two weeks I have had zero problems with the app. The reason I did not give them a five is that they never answer support requests. They need to understand they are in a customer service field of business, not just an app development business."
489,489,2,2016-06-20T20:43:07.000Z,Rellimlk,No Heath App integration,"Count and med logging options are thorough. Charts and stats are top-notch,This may be useful for folk with Type 1 diabetes or others who MUST use medication to manage.  But the app suffers from not being integrated with IOS Health, and therefore not sharing information with other excellent Heath tools that are out there which a lot of people already use."
490,490,5,2009-01-05T04:11:29.000Z,HendrixMarley5,Diabetes helper indeed...,"Downloaded this app a few minutes ago and am already very impressed. Easy to input numbers and easy to view.  would say that the first thing I noticed was the scroll wheel. obviously I'm a fan, after all, if Apple does it, then it's all right in my book. Another thing I saw was the option to send feedback directly through the program. Keeping as much as possible in the program (as opposed to having to open my own email client) is very beneficial for me so if I have any questions I can just type away."
491,491,5,2010-06-02T01:27:49.000Z,nanabugsy,Truly Awesome App,"Updated Review:  Since my last review, which was nearly a year ago, I continue to be a big time fan of this application.  The advent of the A1C calculation has allowed me to keep really accurate check on where I am over any given 90 day period.  Therefore, there are never any surprises when I go into the doctor for my blood work every 6 months and I have found the calculated A1C results to be nearly identical to the lab.  I have been and continue to be an extremely well controlled diabetic of 20 years but this is the best tool I have ever had to assist me in staying healthy.  Thanks GB for such a GREAT application."
492,492,4,2010-11-20T21:07:10.000Z,BillCreech3Gs,"Best free app to manage your Glucose Readings, But HATE the ADs",I think that Glucose Buddy is the  Best free app to manage your Glucose Readings and better than some of the paid apps. But I HATE the ADs at the bottom of the screen!!!!!
493,493,5,2011-05-02T11:54:26.000Z,SuzanMatos,Keeping me on track,"Having this app in my phone where it is always handy has made keeping a detailed log so much easier for me. Being able to add details of activity, food, meds, weight, blood pressure, etc, makes for a great review with my endocrinologist. I can email her my logs before our appointment. The graph is a great visual aide. And it has helped me see my own patterns which has helped me get things under control."
494,494,5,2011-05-18T13:29:39.000Z,C-Me,Easy to use and great management tool,Made it very easy to track my gestational diabetes. With no experience this app was easy to use and learn. As a tool I heartily cite it as the reason why the docs said I had a successful pregnancy.
495,495,5,2011-11-01T05:00:30.000Z,Wondered,Extremely useful and simple,"As a ""new"" diabetic I scrambled to find tools to keep track of my sugar levels in a way that would be practical."
496,496,5,2011-11-01T14:53:44.000Z,Notagamerreally,Perfect for gestational diabetes,Have found it extremely useful to keep track of my BG since being diagnosed with gestational diabetes. The note part is great because I am controlling it with diet so I can note what I ate that gave the reading and understand better how to choose the next meal!
497,497,5,2012-10-12T15:14:21.000Z,p-kinch,"Wow...had issues, but they were fixed...and FAST...makes this app the best I've found.","What can I say...except Wow. I contacted the developer about my issues, and presto, they were handled immediatly. He contacted me to let me know that the fixes would be added to the next upgrade, stayed in contact to keep me abreast of the progress in getting the upgrade ok'ed by Apple. I beleive this whole process took less than a week. This developer, Tom, not only has the best diabetic program I've found on the App. store...he really cares about how his program fits your needs."
498,498,4,2013-02-04T01:28:30.000Z,Jimbo1964,Can't beat it for a free app...,"I've tried to find apps to manage type 2 diabetes, this one is pretty simple.  You have to enter the foods yourself, but only the first time.  Slowly you build up a library.  I also have a food called ""carbs"" to account for things like condiments, etc.  When you log in the foods, put the carb amount in the name, then when you choose it, you will know the number of carbs automatically because it's right there.  I use it to monitor my diet too, so when I log meat and cheese (0 carbs) you have to enter 1 because it won't accept 0."
499,499,5,2013-02-24T15:01:24.000Z,The Only One Maloo,Logging levels,"Controlling BS is challenging. Working with your medical medical is vital for better BS control which require sometimes showing how your BS runs during a certain periods of time, all the time. This app is GREAT because it allows you to put it down immediately, it's put on graphs of your BS and makes a running list of when taken and add notes so when you go to see your physician, it's right in the palm of your hands to help you in in communicating your diabetic needs. Many like myself put forth an effort to keep good records but for some reason, you forget your log book on the day of your appointment, this app will allow you to be better prepared to show your doctor your logs and be ready to get the needed help for making the needed adjustments more accurately."
500,500,5,2009-06-30T07:39:51.000Z,Koko11,Awesome whole lot better than onetouch ultra smart,I just bought the onetouch ultra smart to keep up and log every little thing but this is way better. I also have the mini and never use it because I couldn't log it in the ultra smart. The founder being diabetic himself is what makes this app and future updates of this app so good. It's great that it is free now as I would have paid for it. Only suggestion would be a food database and place to put total calories and grams of fat carbs and protein. Maybe also ability to log glucose and insulin on same entry if it was taken at same time. It is awesome that it syncs to the website and can be emailed or printed. My doctor is going to love this because I HATE keeping up with my readings but this will make it so much easier. THANK YOU!!!
501,501,5,2009-09-04T10:53:18.000Z,Piercetd1,#1 fan of glucose buddy,"This program has been the key to sucess in managing my diabetes. I have tried several other diabetes apps, this one has it together. My physican and dibetes staff can log in my acct anytime to check on my status and help me maintain perfect control. I would gladly pay $$$$ for this program anyday. No paper logs for my doc anylonger. It would be nice to have an option for a note field only, on main screen to describe health or other items your experiencing. Currently I have to list under the (4) standard options (glucose,meds,food,activity), also if this could allow you to add oral medication with mg doseage it would be great. Overall I recomend this to any diabetic. If I had an option for 10 stars"
502,502,5,2009-12-04T18:45:44.000Z,GY*,CMO,"I just wanted to say Thank You!!! Life as a person with diabetes is not easy, especially with Type 1, it is a huge balancing act of not to eat too much, too little, too this, too that. ¬†Physical activities have to be planned out ahead of time and insulin/food has to be calculated accordingly. ¬†One miscalculation in my 5 shots/day and my entire day could be ruined. ¬†But your tool makes life a bit easier to deal with. ¬†I always have my iPhone with me, and don't have to worry about carrying a log book around. ¬†You graph things out, and allow me to dissect the information I've entered - all the stuff I used to do manually with excel. ¬†Now you've made that part of diabetes control automatic and easier - and for that, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. ¬†Please continue helping us."
503,503,5,2009-12-23T17:10:39.000Z,Dougb4,How do you do it free?,"This is a short update. I'm changing to 5 stars. The graph has been added again. It got to be a hobby to find the best app. I bought and tried a couple more. This free app is the best of any. Very professional. The only thing I would like to see changed is an ability to make changes in data submitted mistakenly. Small problem, huh?"
504,504,5,2010-02-25T03:32:57.000Z,Sparks361,Fantastic app,"This is a fantastic app.  Extremely professionally done, great graphics and very simple to use.  I have had it for several months and when I have had a question or two the support is almost immediate and superb.  I can not recommend this app strongly enough. And to top it all off it is free.  An app this well done could go for some serious coins if the owner so wished.  Mega congrats to him in trying to help us with this disease. The ability to sync the data to a web site is great too. The sync issue mentioned previously appears to be fixed and I got immediate response from their support in this regard. I have seen few sites to respond so qiuickly to a reported issue."
505,505,4,2010-03-21T04:09:16.000Z,Hazmattom,Glucose Buddy...,"Update 20 Mar 10:  Played with this app for a while now.  I love it.  I have to say of all the apps I tried (and bought), this is by far the best one out there.  I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars though because of the email part of the app.  I would love it if there was a way to send only part of the entries and not have to send all of them each time.  Maybe send only the last 2 weeks.  My Dr. does review the data but does not like getting every entry each time.  Just a thought."
506,506,3,2011-03-16T16:44:49.000Z,dowens99,Recommend not using Alarms/Alerts,"This app used to be great. It's still good but is buggy now.  I recommend not setting any alerts or alarms. I set alerts for 8am, 5pm and 10pm so I can take my meds and insulin appropriately.  The alerts go off haphazardly (my 8am just went off 15 mins ago at 12:30 in the afternoon).  Even better, it went off SEVERAL DAYS after I had deleted ALL the alerts since they are useless!

This integrated with the calorie tracker has really helped me as long as I stick with using it... The only part that is hard is finding the food from the grocery store in the app.. I tended to just make them in the favorites list and input the nutrition info myself.. You only have to do it once and then it's saves it :)... It would be easier if you could search it by different categories (for ex. ""English muffins"" and then all the English muffin brands would come up... If they were in order then you could also use that to find the lowest carb english muffins for example.. Just a thought :D)"

Sometimes it will not let me connect to the server when I sync but it does at a later time, so no big deal.  I like the data and graph, but they could be improved.  The data should be able to print full comments.  The graph should print larger and the advertising pop up should not blocking any parts of the graph when printed.  I like the program and use the free app.  I don't want the paid app and refuse also to pay an annual fee.  I give it a 5 for its ease of use and would like to see these minor items fixed. If they want to keep the fee ok, but one time only like most other apps."

Today I upgraded to Version 2.0, a much more robust program with a neat web interface, and was completely blown away by the tech support I received.

I had to report my levels to my doctor weekly and it was very easy with the reports I could generate with Glucose Buddy. It would have been much harder for me to control my gestational diabetes without this app, I would have never been able to keep so organized. I gave birth to a healthy, 7lb6oz boy and I am certain that has everything to do with keeping on top of my diabetes because of Glucose Buddy.  So thank you so much!"

I am now disappointed. The incorporation was a great idea but the overall organization is terrible.  All logs come on a single list  I think different screens to track different items would be a much better way to go.  And when the logs are emailed. they come up jumbled together.

This app has made it so easy to keep up with the hundreds on numbers we input and email to our endocrinologist every 3 months. both of my children's a1c levels are between 6.0 and 6.5 every 3 months. This is a must have app if your serious about tight blood control.  The only thing I wish is that you could have more than one user or profile on 1 app. I have to use an iPhone and an iPod to have individual profiles for each of my kids.

It also let's me log everything from food to glucose to exercise. The partnering with the calorie counter also has helped me lose weight. Sometimes the calorie counter can crash but just open it again and its fine. I love that everything is pushed online and my doctor can see everything I do. Can very finely tune my pump settings.

Don't waste your money on the Calorie Tracker option... It's not ready for ""prime time""... Crashes and needs too much input if you want to track your typical foods.  But, Glucose Buddy without Calorie Tracker is very useful and works without any problems.  Makes no sense to keep a paper log anymore!"

Would like to be able to sum up carbs from app. And it's not easy to print/email selected records... You have to share large chunks of data. Also, when we got charged more than once for taking advantage of syncing across multiple devices, the app store folks did not quite get why we were not supposed to be charged! But eventually it worked out. Using this app has given our family tremendous peace of mind as we learned about our son's new diagnosis of type-1 diabetes."

This one's in 2nd place...the interface is ok, though there seem to be a few more touches required than necessary for several of the steps. Also there's a 3-4 second loading lag at the start. These may seem small but entering 4 glucose readings a day, exercise record and meals and snacks means 8 or more sessions, day in and day out, so delays are a disincentive to stay with the app. Also only glucose is graphed. Also, no daily totals for carbs. No tracking of calories, blood pressure or weight, which are just as important as glucose."

I thought to go online and run the GB A1C prior to going in, and also printed the log out to show the doc.  I told him what I was doing, and that GB predicted my A1C at 7.08%.  The doctor doubted the results stating that patients with my control level and medicine dosage, not to mention my history, are above 8%.  Never the less, he jotted down the Glucose Buddy A1C estimate.  When the lab test results came back, they were EXACTLY as Glucose Buddy predicted.  Hats off to Glucose Buddy!"

My last doctor visit proved how dangerous this had become.  My A1c level had risen significantly. Shocked by how much in as little as 3 months, I quickly went looking for an app to help keep me on track.  I really like the ease of entering in my readings and the correct descriptions  that correspond to each.  It has worked because it has provided a better visual of how I am doing and has encouraged me to continue to stay in my correct range. Ease and graphs are what make this app a good choice."

However, my son was only recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and his bgl tends to go all over the place, especially when he doesn't keep track of things as well as bye should!  The biggest detractor from this program is that it used the ""dials"" in order to enter numbers. A key pad would be so much easier, and it wouldn't have a 400 level limit on bgl. The only other ""opportunity for improvement"" that I see, is each log entry should be entered on its own line when exporting the log. As it is now, I have to copy and paste it into a text file on my desktop in order to manually review the logs."

I understand some things might have needed to been cut with the entire overhaul, but this charting feature was an excellent way for me to discuss my glucose levels with my doctor during visits. Please bring this feature back. Otherwise a perfect lil app!!!"

But without the graph function it becomes worthless for me even my doctor prefers the graph as it is easier to look at a trend then indvidual logs. Nice look on the new interface though taking away features for a prettier app does not help. Put the graph back and easily a 5 star app again.

One drawback, when you email numbers to the doc, it sends them ALL. It would be awesome to send a range (1 week, month, etc). My doc informed me she printed 25 pages of my blood sugar numbers and asked if I would do the slightly annoying task of deleting some of the old numbers. Wouldn't be too much of a problem, but I'm emailing twice a week as I'm getting into the last couple of weeks of my pregnancy. All together this is great and has saved me time and money already!!!

Also love the note section, inputting my sugars and insulin in the same log and having it sync to an online account that can give you an idea of your A1C and a more in depth look at your trends. I just wish you could sync from a computer to device and not just visa versa. Also wish there was something that gave you a number for you averages and not just a graph. But over all a MUST have for all diabetics! No more pen and paper and no more running out of space writing when logging! ;)"

I paid for the weight function however I only can enter that through the iPhone not the website. The graph display on the iPhone allows only one add-on to be displayed even though website indicates multiples can be displayed. The print out all of the graph on the website is in accurate and you cannot change the defaults for what is displayed. Moreover, the developer is never answered any of my questions. I have had this for a few weeks now and the jury is still out as to it's worth of $6.99."

As it is, there IS a ""Notes"" field, but it's one tiny, narrow box that doesn't expand; you can enter data endlessly, I suppose, but it's impossible to read. Other than that one complaint, GB is a simple, easy-to-use straightforward app with a lot of features. One HUGE plus: almost all features are available without needing the Pro version, and even without the Pro version, you don't get slammed with stupid ads or requests to upgrade.

As a diabetic who checks his blodd 6 to 7 times a day this tool is invaluable.

The ability to record food and glucose AND medications AND activities all in one place is well thought out and really slick. The only part I would improve is the documentation of how the event alerts work -- it's not too hard to figure it out, but as well designed as the rest of the app is, it's a rough edge that really doesn't need to be there."

I would have rated this 5 stars if it actually had reminders/push notifications like it says it does. Being the parent of a newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic teenager, I was looking forward to her being able to use the reminders so she wouldn't miss testing her sugar or taking her insulin. But that feature does not exist like the app states it does. So for now it only gets 2 stars in my book and I'll find an app that performs its stated features... with reminders."

Examples: If you want to transfer your data from software in another platform, for instance, you will need to do it all through manually; each date must be entered by spinning a wheel with no separate 'year' component. Entering the meter reading itself requires re-selecting the field after choosing a description for that event. Programmers could easily make this a much more user-friendly app."

When I say that, what I mean is that we've all went looking for a particular app with the hopes that we /might/ be able to find something remotely useful and settled for mediocrity. I didn't find mediocrity... I found a buddy. (How sappy was that, eh?)"
560,560,5,2009-06-19T02:48:50.000Z,daddioPWG,This app has helped me emmensly,This app just keeps getting better and better. I have used this app since February 2009. It has an intuitive and organized interface that's easy to use. I have much better contol of my sugar levels because of this app. My doctor loves the level of detail that was otherwise missing in the handwritten logs. Support has gotten back to me on any issues that I have had. Keep up the great work and thanks.
561,561,5,2009-06-23T20:43:22.000Z,Bkincaid,Just what I was looking for,"Glucose Buddy is just the kind of iPhone-based diabetes log I was looking for. I have tried Islet and Diabetes Log; Glucose Buddy is much better. I like being able to do custom notes to all entries. My life is not routine, so it's nice to catch the nuances of each situation in my notes. Syncing iPhone entries with my online account is awesome. People typically don't just use their iPhone or pc.. The added flexibility of reviewing and editing on both devices is key."

563,563,3,2010-02-23T17:03:03.000Z,Mike Retsoc,Had to delete,"Could not get it to web sync. No reply on that issue from tech support. I like the program, but has several shortcomings (see comments on deleting meds, too-cumulative daily average info, etc.) that have not been addressed.  No updates of late. I think the money for app development has gone away and the program is ""matured"" to where there will be fewer improvements. That said, it's the best free app I found and I liked it. But I seleted it today and went with a $6 paid app that does all this and more including nutrition info. Best of luck."
564,564,2,2010-08-05T10:18:02.000Z,Ljoydam,You better get back some of the old functionality,I gave the earlier version 5 stars. It was a fabulous app and very flexible. The new version: 1) no graph; 2) you can't really see the note entry because it's all squished in one small space now; 3) more steps involved with entering data into the log - it was good having the log on the first screen. The only totally new function (other then a lot of rearranging) is the learning module which is complicated and not very helpful. I could match thing up before with the downloaded file with more ease than the rigid function that appears to be sponsored by a pharmacy.
565,565,5,2011-05-19T04:28:19.000Z,BB-Brain,This is a no-brainer!,"What better way to see how you are doing EVERY DAY! I have been faithfully entering my levels every day for the past 9 months. Every so often I ""read the graphs"" and it really helps me to keep on track. I can tell when I am anxious, or sick and can leave notes to myself to describe where I am. I show my doctor as well. With medication, my levels fall into the pre-diabetes range and I keep to PORTION CONTROL as well. My A1C is at 5.9. That's great. Love this app!!!"
566,566,4,2011-05-22T12:15:53.000Z,LindstromKen,75% of the needed solution.,"When I learned that I was diabetic, I went searching for the one killer app that would track my glucose, activity and food intake, and Glucose Buddy does this well.  I like the fact that I can dump the results into Excel and create my own reports, but the missing item here is a food database to enable quick recording of caloric/carb intake.  I use MyFitnessPal for this purpose.  Together the two apps fit 100% of the need.  Integrating the two or developing the functionality inside GB would be even better."
567,567,4,2012-04-22T14:30:19.000Z,btobg,Nice and simple,"Easy to use. I like that. But what these apps are all missing for me is the ability to alert me when it's time for my meds. Especially needed is for the meds that need to be taken before a meal. The alert should persist until I clear it, and be able to sleep if I'm not ready and tell it to. Most of all, and the hard part for the developers, is that it be able to ""wake"" my iPhone when on standby, but on. Right now I'm using the phone's ""alarm"" feature, but that's pretty awkward."

My doctor asked me to check my blood sugar and a minimum of twice a day, at least three times a day and the check once before a meal and once after email to see how it affects my blood sugar. He wanted to go through the data with me at my next appointment, and the south made that very easy because I can go online and print out my chart."

Plus I can email the log to my doctors. I use it along with Daily Carb - that app has been good for looking up carb values of food. It'd be great if a feature like that could be incorporated into this app.  And it'd be even better if I could plug in an amount of carbs (say 15g) and a food (say quinoa) and have it tell me how much I could eat.

Logging (through a windows app) all the time kept me going when I first encountered this monster, my BG, food and weight, but when I went on vacation and this wasn't possible it was hard to keep it going!"
572,572,3,2009-11-18T14:11:37.000Z,zerpy69,I want the old version back!!!,I loved this app and was excited to see the update. The facelift is great and keypad entry was essential and really makes log entries much faster. But bring back my graphs and ability to filter the log by entry type!!!  The graphs were my motivator and what set this thing apart from a paper log for me. I loved to be able look at the graph and see the hi/low/avg plotted - really helped me keep tight control.

574,574,2,2010-03-27T16:23:40.000Z,Ken Purcell,Yeah it free but at what cost?,I downloaded and used this application along side with three other free applications. It is easy to use and pretty straight forward ap. It does what it promises but the big issue is sharing your data with unknown 3rd parties. I would probably be OK with that if they named who the 3rd parties were and what they are doing with the data. If they data was used for improving treatments or such but I pretty sure it just for marketing purposes. It would be a nightmare it your insurance was qualifying you diabetes compliance.
575,575,5,2011-05-16T10:47:05.000Z,Coach7227,It's Great!,I've had Type 1.5 for 20 years and haven't been the best about testing frequently enough. I also could never be bothered with handwritten logs. Well this app has changed everything! I'm checking 4-5 times a day now and thanks to the log I'm able to finally bolus properly for meals. My graph also shows how much better my control has become in just 2 weeks. This app is a must!

I updated to the premium package because I was tracking my Blood Pressure and Weight in the activity section, it is very nice to have the BP and W plot capability in one package.

I like that entries are very easy to make and that it is user friendly. However, when emailing logs to myself/doctor, insulin units are shown in a different line and are hard to read. Also, you can't select the range of dates when emailing logs. Finally, logs should be displayed from the latest to the most recent and not viceversa. Nonetheless, please note that this is the best app that I have tried thus far."

It's a free program and is great to keep track of your BG. I was planning to get the update except it was a pay add-on. I'm glad I didn't considering it is getting terrible reviews. Instead of adding new stuff on, make it easier for new users to be able to fully use the app. (maybe a dedicated faq/instruction page so users don't have to search for answers to coomon problems)"

With Glucose Buddy on my iPhone, I can log in my numbers immediately and then send them straight to my doctor. It isn't a cure, but it sure makes living with Type 2 much easier."

Super easy to use on the  phone and after you upload the data to the website, produces a variety if graphs that help you spot trends. Printing ability is too limited--you only get the best graphs from Explorer--any other browser you need to do screen shots. Otherwise great for a fee product."

You sync your entries to the PC version (which looks like a 1990s spreadsheet) where there's more functions even. With this last update sync has become unreliable and server not available errors happen frequently. Happily, when the sync is made, no data is lost. Sadly, considering how many diabetics there are, no one has created the perfect app."

MYLEstone, please add the following. (1) Allow upto 400lbs weight, (2) A height of 5'11 always shows up as 5'10, (3) Allow user to edit/delete foods, (4) Do not gray out the numberpad if user opts to not select 'add food', (5) The dial on the 'food tab' is too large and makes the page display poorly, (6) display chart as in previous version."

That has little utility for me since I can't look back and relate a score to a daily activity. Also, it often adds a BOGUS entry on the graph for a test I didn't take!  It looks like it does an average of my high and low scores and creates a graph entry in between. Totally false!!!  Even if I take a third test, the bogus entry remains. Right now the only utility for me is the logging feature. And I could do that with Apple Note. I won't buy this app."

On the down side you have to figure out how many carbs you ate by some other method. There is no access to a food list, not even one you create yourself. Not a problem if you pre-plan your meals, and it's easy enough to remedy by pairing up with another food app of your choice if you don't mind switching back and forth."

I've been using Diabeties Pilot for Palm OS for years and this app is a nice migration with familiar logs and features. The ability to directly email logs and take a snapshot of the graph is wonderful! My only suggestion at this point would be to add the actual estimated A1C average according to the BG average.

The only thing I would fix is that when you are entering a log, there is no ""felt low"" or ""felt high"" tag. So if I check and I'm 50, a week later I won't know if I actually felt low or I happened to be low at a regular check. But other than that, this app is awesome!

Save them to the server and sign up for a free account and you can analyze the data via all sorts of tracking charts.  Brought them to my doctor and blew her away with the detail.  No substitute for real lab testing but a great way to verify you are on track with your efforts.

Glucose Buddy provided printouts of logs for my Internist, and Graphs illustrated my strengths and weaknesses, and eating patterns to share as well. Wonderful Tool!"
620,620,4,2009-07-09T02:27:39.000Z,TomtTom,Great App - Some suggestions,Great App - good approach with syncing and graphs.
621,621,2,2009-11-20T11:12:42.000Z,Mat.6:24-35,A Step in the Wrong Direction,"Version 3.0 is a step back from the prior version in useability and function. The loss of the graphing feature is huge. In addition, at least for me, the syncing feature of this version is not as reliable as the previous version (it seems as though the most current log entry dies not sync).  Also, can't seem to figure out how to delete a log entry. Overall not the best upgrade. Please bring back the reliabilty and functionality of the previous version."
622,622,5,2010-05-25T05:37:34.000Z,TEM,Very Good App,I was using another App that was way to difficult to use for Type 2 needs! I like the way this App works! The comparison log is very useful and the input is a breeze!
623,623,5,2011-09-05T19:35:23.000Z,LaxCoachT,Does what it says,This program has been a great asset in helping me control my blood sugar. It is easy to use and the graph helps with the visual look at how your blood sugar has been going. Being able to record medicine is a great added feature in the overall decision making on your control of your diabetes. Highly recommend.
624,624,3,2011-11-21T01:26:16.000Z,rdricks2000,"Good program, spotty alerts","I have been using the program for a couple years. I love the idea, and until recently the execution. I rely on the alerts that are tied to an activity. 2 hours after I input a pre-meal activity it prompts me to check my numbers."
625,625,1,2012-02-07T03:26:46.000Z,isooner,This would be good but one big problem.....,"I bought this 4 days ago and registered on their website so I could sync with their website and get more detailed charts etc... however.... I can't do any of that becuase after 4 days they've never sent me the 'verification e-mail"" that I have to link from to verify my e-mail address.  I can't log into their website and ask them, I""ve e-mailed them twice from the app itsself, but I've gotten absolutely no answer.  This looks like it would be a good app if it did what it says it can do, but so far, ZERO customer service and NO LOGINS!"
626,626,4,2013-01-08T06:02:14.000Z,Talk2tisa,"Pretty good, but...","I like the app and is is functional but would be much better with just a few tweaks. First, it would be great if it was really integrated with CT. Secondly, another APP I used on my droid kept a running average of A1C, just based on glucose readings. Finally, I don't like that everything is jumbled together, such as glucose levels, medications, etc in the list. It makes it kind of hard to take a quick view."
627,627,5,2013-02-27T04:23:45.000Z,mikeindm,Good application...,"Looks good, so far it's working well... one thing I'd like to see is the ability to log A1C values and to graph them."
628,628,5,2014-05-28T17:13:22.000Z,Kf984jpl,Glucose Buddy,"I like the sync feature so in case of a crash the data is safe unlike dlife which I used to use but now avoid, since it lost all my data. The sync feature doesn't work hardly ever though and it's one way sync only.  I wish this app offered more graph features but it's still pretty good."
629,629,5,2017-06-16T11:06:59.000Z,grandmacj699,NO Updates since 2012!,This is a very good ap and easy to use and I wanted to upgrade to the Pro version but it concerns me that it's been so long since and upgrade was done and the reviews were not that encouraging along with your customer service. I just don't understand a company with a great product to not be concerned about these things.
630,630,5,2009-06-15T21:20:16.000Z,Lee Perry,WOW...what a great tool,This has really changed how I track and therefore manage my diabetes. I was having problems keeping my BG even below 300.  The tool has helped me lower my BG to by almost 150 points because of being able to manage most aspects of my diabetes in one place.  The graphs have been great for me since I'm very visual. I can't imagine not having Glucose Buddy!
631,631,2,2009-07-18T02:40:39.000Z,Jackzen69,diabetic,"this was one of the first apps I got for my iphone everything works great except for one thing you can't input your glucose, medication, meal and exercise at the same time. this gets very tedious very fast. so much so that I now use a app that isn't as good as this one is in all other areas but, it let's me put all my information in at once. That one little thing is the reason this app won't work for me. it seems it wouldn't be that hard of a fix. until it happens I will be using the other app though"
632,632,5,2010-04-13T21:23:40.000Z,Angry Pickle,Great little program. Love the graphs and availability via website.,"I really like how this app allows me to record my medication, then displays both medication and glucose readings on the same graph so I can see how it effects my levels. The ability to sync to the website so I can view it all on a bigger screen is also a really nice feature."
633,633,5,2011-05-18T14:11:19.000Z,nj4x4fever,Fantastic easy to log and track,This is a fantastic app for those who have to keep track of your blood glucose levels. I highly recommend this free app with many options that can be customized for your individual needs. I am a type 2 diabetic and I am able to keep track of my progress through the free app.
634,634,3,2011-06-21T18:00:37.000Z,VIPRKC,Good start - needs more features,"It seems hard to press buttons (dose, carbs, etc. Are covered by time of day and the mimetic keypad)."
635,635,5,2012-10-06T16:59:01.000Z,NewCreation2005,Great App for Diabetics,"This app has been great for helping to track my glucose levels along with my weight, blood pressure and other important health numbers. It's great because I no longer have to worry if I forget to take my glucose logs to the Doctor it's all on my phone, and I can also sync it to my computer. Good job in this and it's user friendly."
636,636,5,2012-10-15T06:24:11.000Z,samsam4892,Helping me stay in control,After being a type 1 diabetic for 11 years and having out of control numbers it finally clicked that I needed to make a change. This app has helped me to track my blood sugar numbers and I already feel better! Easy to use on the go and syncs very quickly!
637,637,5,2013-05-04T20:53:26.000Z,Pohai81,Best glucose monitoring app!,Being diagnosed with diabetes 10 years ago I had to hand write my glucose levels down all the time. After using this app it just makes things so much easier to track my levels. I don't have to waste paper and I always have it on me. I have no excuse to forget to write my numbers down.
638,638,2,2013-07-03T01:14:03.000Z,weintrw,Just another DM software,There are many of these out there.  Great graphics but really a database which you have to enter all the data. For some reason I found this a pain to enter my BS or insulin dose when compared to what the meter does by itself.
639,639,4,2017-05-01T06:04:36.000Z,Stancie Rich,Convenient Record Keeper,I really like Glucose Buddy because it captures all the information I need to monitor and manage my diabetes.  There is a place to record medications I take and my BG levels measured at various times a day.  I especially like the notes section where I can also note unusual circumstances and other health issues. Helps me and my doctor figure out how to maintain good BG levels more often!
640,640,4,2009-01-25T04:33:07.000Z,Excited type 2,Type 2 need a tool,Newly type 2 diabetic on pills right now and would like to keep track of when I take my medicine. All the application I have found are designed for insulin. Need the option to track pill intake to. Plus this application needs to be able to choose what stats to view on my info. I don't like tracking food because everything has to be entered separately.
641,641,4,2011-06-10T18:05:47.000Z,MommaJess31,Great App,"This is a really good app for monitoring blood sugar levels. It is easy to use, reliable, and the connection with the web age is awesome. I like the reports you are able to print out. It is a very helpful app. The only thing I would suggest is a better food log/carb counter. And the ability to track ketones.  I tried other, more involved and expensive apps and this one just does the trick."
642,642,5,2011-12-01T01:11:07.000Z,Tmadden17,Great App!,I have been a type 1 diabetic for a loooong time. I was diagnosed before testing strips existed. This app is pretty amazing and keeps all of my info in one spot. I have always had a bunch of the little log books lying around and this makes things much easier. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to manage their diabetes.
643,643,4,2012-01-01T15:27:03.000Z,Cycle Nuts,Recommend,Good app - Not willing to upgrade.  Takes time getting personal meds and foods into the database.  Suggest getting an additional app to determine carb count other than the one suggested. Dissapointed that there is not an option to turn off the sync counter.  If this app had a better way to determine carbs and allowed the sync counter to be disabled i would give it a 5 star rating.
644,644,5,2012-12-24T14:51:15.000Z,jdroid2012,Really handy!,This is a great app for tracking glucose. I was able to enter old readings manually with no problem. It sorts corrections and keeps things in date order really well. I'm eager for an iPad version or at least for the iPhone version to support rotating but that's not a big deal. Bottom line it's a great app across many platforms.
645,645,5,2013-04-07T15:19:53.000Z,Liz Lara,Great app,This is a very easy to use way to keep track of glucose levels. I use this to Track for my gestational diabetes. It's easy for on the go use. It beats having to hand log in. On line sync lets you email to your dr. Office. This is a great app to have. I truly recommend it if you serious about monitoring and keeping up with you health.
646,646,5,2014-10-20T16:24:10.000Z,Chels4723,Very helpful!,This app has really saved me. I have gestational diabetes & I'm at home on bed rest with twins after a month in the hospital. Keeping track of the numbers is a lot & this app is simple & easy to use. I love how I can see all my numbers on one screen & how easy it is to input numbers. I would definitely recommend it!
647,647,4,2014-11-14T12:44:24.000Z,Flaircat057,Great trending app for BG,"I really only use this app as a way to keep track of my BG to pass on to my doctors. I do not really use too many of the other functions, yet. So far this has been easy to use and allows me to keep track of things I eat, insulin taken, and resulting BG through out the day. If the other functions work just as well, then I would bump the rating up to 5 stars."
648,648,5,2016-01-19T09:33:11.000Z,Music lover 4 life's,A s avo,Really good app for managing my diabetes especially people who who have trouble writing I've found it easier to hit the buttons on my phone then write at times also nice to have blood sugars with me rite on my phone that's with me all the time in case I need to look back to track blood sugars unexpectedly also nice to sync when at Drs appts.
649,649,5,2017-04-19T01:52:40.000Z,Rollie16,Back on track,"I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes in 2008. Over the last few years I had become lax in checking my glucose. Last week, after checking my glucose, I saw that it was higher than it needed to be. This app keeps me accountable for my food choices throughout the day.  Easy to use and convenient"
650,650,4,2008-12-14T04:56:59.000Z,cstenn,A really solid app!,"I think this is a great app. My only suggestion would be to allow for food to be grouped into meals. Right now, you enter each food item as a separate entry which gets tiring. It would be great to create ""lunch"" entry with multiple items. That way, you could see the total carb count for that meal and see what you ate, all in one screen. Otherwise, I really like it."
651,651,5,2009-07-05T19:21:08.000Z,Jozipp,This tool is great,TRY THIS APP FIRST! After using this tool for a week I must say it's more than I expected. Data entry is easy and log displays are clean. I had a sync problem but email support was quick and successful. I would like to see a category for blood pressure added in a future version. This version seem to run fine on iPhone OS 3.0.
652,652,4,2011-05-16T05:38:15.000Z,Mom2274,Great. Works 4 me,"I don' always test on the same meter. One in my purse, one in my desk, and one at home. I always have my phone handy so I can record my sugars and my Drs. and I review at a glance. I am also a kidney transplant patient and use it to record daily blood pressures. Since I see several specialists, I always have my numbers available.  I am probably not fully utilizing all the features, but it works for me."
653,653,5,2011-11-29T16:11:15.000Z,Enasia,Reliable,"Glucose buddy helps me keep track of my blood sugar and meals. It makes it easier for my doctor to review daily readings. So far I think this is a wonderful app for anyone who is diabetic and forget to write their numbers down. Now all they need to do is push some buttons and save and they have an accurate record. Great, great app."
654,654,5,2012-01-13T04:27:02.000Z,Grammytot,Wonderful app!,I really like this app.  Great for tracking and letting my doctor see the data and the graphs.  Love that I can sync it and keep the data for comparison purposes.  Thanks for a versitle and valuable tool!  I was using it on my iPod Touch and now use it on my iPad.  Wish there were some way to load the old data to my iPad though.
655,655,4,2012-08-25T14:39:13.000Z,Hey_j,Transition made simple!,GB has definitely helped me to better organize my readings & plan for a healthier lifestyle. The email function is great! Being able to send an email if your history to yourself or even your Doctor is great. Being able to print out & view what I ate that spiked my sugar really makes this transition less stressful. I highly recommend GB. No problems so far with the app.
656,656,5,2012-10-04T16:57:53.000Z,mr_pivo,Great App!,I have Type 2 diabetes and have been using Glucose Buddy for well over two years now I've found it to be one of the easiest and best app for keeping track of variety of data points that my doctor wants me to track. I have tried many other free and paid apps and this is hands down the best.
657,657,5,2012-12-29T11:52:02.000Z,Nyt reader since 1998,Made my life easier!,"This is my 2nd pregnancy managing my gestational diabetes with this app and it's been great!  I love being able to quickly enter my blood sugar level, when I checked, what part of the day it was (post-prandial, out of bed, etc), and the free space to make a little note to myself about what I ate or extenuating circumstances. Thank you!"
658,658,5,2015-10-13T18:34:14.000Z,Todd-Squad,Solid tracking program,"I've enjoyed using this program for the last week. It is simple, intuitive and very capable for tracking blood glucose, food intake and medication. It allows you to customize your food and medication. I recommend this program for people of all ages."
659,659,4,2016-03-03T14:50:03.000Z,Hallstine,Great free app!,"This app has really helped me get my T1 diabetes back on track.  After a few uses I was familiar enough with the app to very quickly navigate and input my BS and insulin dosages. My biggest complaint is that the free version doesn't have a food/carb database. I have to input all the info myself, which is a hassle.  Despite this, I love this app, especially compared to others I've tried. :)"
660,660,4,2009-06-01T12:50:08.000Z,Optimist Prime,Good for tracking/managing.,"I use this app daily. There have been lots of improvements and bug fixed since I started and it just keeps getting better. It has helped me track my blood sugar levels and manage my diabetes since diagnosis. The only gripe I have is that the charts it emails can be difficult to read for the doctors and nurses who need the info. Overall, great app."
661,661,5,2010-01-04T21:14:04.000Z,LexTac,Love This App!,"I have been using the GB App for about two months. I love the automatic sync to the GB website. Since I have been using this app, I have yet to write a glucose test value down. My control is better and my Doctor really likes the print out that I take to him on check-up days. If you have Diabetes, this app is for you!"
662,662,4,2011-05-31T04:37:26.000Z,Lalaot,Helps keep track of glucose levels!,"I like that I can keep track of my levels. My only negative for this app is that I can't send weekly glucose level to my doctor.  I would have to erase the old one in the email.  Tech support was quick to respond that they are working on it allowing us to pick dates to email our levels to our doctor/dietitian,etc."
663,663,5,2012-01-06T07:58:11.000Z,Shamay Groman,Amazing space and time saver,"This handy app saves the space a logbook, food diary, and info book and it has everything a well organized diabetic needs! It even gets all the detailed info that a log book doesn't have . My only issue is on the tool selection scroll it resets on the right side."
664,664,5,2013-01-09T02:08:43.000Z,Tabik pf,Highly recommend,As a medical professional I find this tool to be very efficient for the patient to monitor and record blood glucose levels. This app allows the patient and their providers an effective tool for diabetic control and delivering glucose levels in an easy to read manner while sharing data.
665,665,5,2013-01-18T11:53:37.000Z,Islandblen64,Great app!,This is a very good app! Been using it for a couple of years now. It's a simple and reliable way to keep track of my blood sugars. I even taught my Endocrinologist how to use it when I visit her. I used this app to email by BS when my doc was requesting them. Would recommend this app to anyone. Thanks for creating it. üòã
666,666,1,2014-07-23T11:24:42.000Z,mhfaboo,Syncing doesn‚Äôt work most of the time,"I'm requesting that the app price of $6.99 be refunded. It would appear that the developers no longer support the app (based on multiple comments in the app forum) and, sadly, the app does not function properly. The primary problem - and the reason for paying for the pro version - is that syncing rarely works. When one attempts to sync, whether via the website or via the app, the repeated attempts tend to time out in most cases, making the $6.99 payment a complete waste of money."
667,667,1,2015-03-21T14:55:56.000Z,drachc,No Support,"I've tried contacting support several days ago-still no response, after paing for the App.  Problem has been I can't sync data up to the website.  It always tells me I haven't activated my account.  BUT, I can get into my account from the website - which presents another problem.  EVERYTIME I try to log in on the website I'm forced to reset my password.  It works, and my personal info is there, just not my BG readings.  When I log out I have to go through the process all over again of resetting my password."
668,668,5,2015-04-16T11:33:03.000Z,Pita1126,Love love love,I love this app! It keeps me on track with my blood sugars and A1c. I show it to my doctor at every visit to help him make recommendations on medications. It is great to see the graph and averages too. I don't know how the paid version could be any better than the free version. Thank you for an app that actually makes my life easier!
669,669,5,2015-10-25T02:34:36.000Z,Eva2801,Best app I've found,"This is the best tracking app I've found. I don't put in detailed data about food or activity (yet) so I have not tried those functions. But for tracking sugar measurements, it works great. And I have not gotten the full version yet."

I've had diabetes for 19 years and have never been good at tracking my BGs or food entries but this puts it all at my finger tips and makes it very easy to send the data. I really like everything about the app and will inform my endocrinologist and CDE, and the Diabetes Center where I volunteer about the application. Thank you."
671,671,1,2009-05-17T22:44:59.000Z,Hamachi3345,Why did I update!,"Earlier version was much simpler, now I need an online account, now I need to sync my input readings with online account otherwise I have a numeral on the app icon like I get on iphone email app when I recieve new email, on the my info page use to be able to look at average BG over the length of time, not there anymore, instead of average you can input which meter you use. Come on now the earlier version was nice and simple and to the point, would gladly pay $5 - 10 for the earlier version if still available!"

I like all of the different options it allows for me to do especially the food and exercise. I especially like the fact I can email my doctor results as well as myself.

HORRIBLE integration with calorie tracker though. Just plain terrible on calorie tracker end as I can NOT get the suggested app to merge-it crashes. Why would they choose this app/company/kid that makes this??!? HELP!

Who measures the amount of food they've eaten in grams?? There needs to be more choices for how the food eaten is measured. Even a place for putting carbs would be nice. I've just been putting my carb intake in the ""notes"" section and a ""1"" in the grams section. If they fix this problem it will be perfect!"
678,678,4,2016-01-26T19:45:41.000Z,arielmp,Great app,I like the ease of tracking my sugar levels. One thing that would actually be a nice feature (and I would pay for this feature) is to be able to zoom in/customize look on the graph. I don't need to see an obscure view that goes up to 450 when I diet manage everything under 150.
679,679,5,2017-06-14T10:55:31.000Z,Newpictn,IOS Update?,I keep getting a notification that this app will no longer work due to no update becoming available. I really like it and would hate to have to find another. There isn't a date that will happen but an update to prevent that would be great!!

I can't believe it's free!,I am a newly diagnosed diabetic and this app is the only thing that makes me feel as if I have some control over this disease. I love that I can download my data to the website.  Taking the data into Excel has made it much easier for me to look for patterns. Keep up the good work!
683,683,5,2011-05-22T22:12:38.000Z,DB66,Very helpful,"I am relatively newly diagnosed as diabetic, just starting out with keeping track of readings.  I looked at several related apps, and prefer this one.  I use only some of its features, but it has made record keeping simple, even enjoyable.  My doctor seems quite satisfied with the graphs I show her."
684,684,5,2011-08-31T15:56:47.000Z,Bud.G,Exceptional,"I started using this app upon switching from oral medications to insulin.  The program was intuitive, quick and reasonably easy to use.  I emailed both numerical data, comments, dose changes, and graphics to my Diabetologist, effecting easy recognition of trends, and markedly enhancing our ability to control the diabetes."
685,685,4,2011-10-28T14:53:50.000Z,ams26237,love the app,"i second what everyone else is saying. and i love the reminder to check levels after eating. brilliant.  i did however have issues with the CT integration and never heard back from the support desk. my CT logs dont sync with the GB like its supposed to. and i wish there were ways to get more info on ""how to's"" within the app. but i love using this app. its oh so very helpful!"
686,686,5,2011-11-07T03:27:15.000Z,Gilodad,Easy to use,Just found out I have type 2 and GB has been a great help into this world of tracking blood sugar and other stats. It is user friendly and the sync feature has given my wife a way to follow everything without having to ask all the time.
687,687,4,2012-10-26T12:41:19.000Z,SAECMember,Good Tool,I use Glucose Buddy every day. It really helps me keep track re how I am doing. I use the graphing feature to share my status with my doctor. Only problem I have run into is printing the graphs. It takes me several minutes of hacking around to get the printout I want. GB claims its not their fault. Don't know about that. I would pay extra to get good graph printing.
688,688,5,2014-09-04T04:49:19.000Z,DukeZuke,Easy to use!,Simple app to store and track blood sugar levels. Blood sugar meter syncs with computer already so I only use to keep records and quickly review past results. Will start using other features such as A1C tracking when I need to.  No technical issues so far!
689,689,5,2014-09-14T14:08:09.000Z,Susan happy,Great free app,"It tracks my daily readings and gives me a graph showing high, low, and average readings for the day.  The graph also has a green shaded area to show the normal range.  Everything else is a premium feature, however these basic features are what I needed.  The info is easy to enter and attractively presented."
690,690,5,2011-08-01T15:01:09.000Z,Webslinger0513,The Best !!!,"A complete glucose/medication/carb and exercise app with GREAT features. I love being able to add notes to each entry. My diabetic team loves the email feature. Although don't bother with calorie track, GoMeals is so much easier to use and has a much better database. When will GB be able to sync with the new Fitness Buddy!?!"
691,691,5,2012-01-30T18:18:38.000Z,cc70458,Very useful,This product is proved a godsend for me in managing my diabetes as I often test with multiple meters depending on where I am at a given time. this works very well to enable me to have one single repository of everything and be able to bring it to the doctor and show him the numbers and a graph.
692,692,4,2012-02-20T20:04:09.000Z,GmaKaren,LOVE IT!,"I've used Glucose Buddy for 3 yrs to log my blood glucose readings. Easy to use. Great to print readings for docs. As a glucose tracker, Glucose Buddy, is great... and I've tried many others. Only 4 stars cause trying to integrate with their calorie counting program, Calorie Track, is impossible; it crashes every time. Calorie Track is a waste. Use Livestrong's My Daily Plate instead for calorie tracking. It's excellent."
693,693,5,2012-10-01T01:42:24.000Z,Theodore Brackett,Glucose Buddy Works to Save My Life.,"Without Glucose Buddy I would not be able to track my b/s. I can see what is and has happened, all times. I can plan what I need to do to control my disease.  My doctor can easily see what is happening with me and prescribe what need to do in the future. I have to say ,Glucose Buddy  is my best friend."
694,694,4,2012-11-08T15:25:02.000Z,Gbkelly,Great!,"I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, and this app really helps keep me in track. Like others have said, I wish it would sync with Myfitness Pal. Also, I wish there was a way to email specific parts of your log to your provider, instead of the whole thing every time. Otherwise, fantastic app....especially for being free!!!"
695,695,4,2013-02-05T08:41:31.000Z,zach.lee98,Pretty good,I really like this app. I've had Type 1 Diabetes fr nearly four years now and I used to hate my doctor telling me that I have to write down numbers so I never did x). but now it's easy!
696,696,4,2013-07-05T16:27:13.000Z,Hangrueber420,Very useful,"Love the ease of entry, the graphs, & the ability to send a clear, easy to read email to my daughters doctor. They only thing I haven't figured out is how to add the carbs. It only seems to allow the grams. I would like to see how the amount and type of carbs affects her bg. This is not to say the app doesn't do that, just that I haven't figured it out yet."
697,697,5,2014-05-19T11:11:26.000Z,dt <><,Nice Tool,"This is a nice tool that is easy to use as well as being handy. I was ably to enter all my data from my paper journal. I wish I could graph my weight along with my glucose levels.  However, I am able to include my daily weight as a comment so my paper journal is no longer required."
698,698,5,2014-07-07T16:04:38.000Z,..~GiGi~,Azumio geniues,"I am type 2 diabetic with the help of this app I was able to get my a1c down from 13 to 6.6 in a little over 1 month! I am a nurse and have had several of my PTA , Doctors & fellow nurses download this app and teach their PTA how to use it! I love the graph and I upload my bs to my chart at my des once a month! Genius!!! 10*********"
699,699,5,2014-12-09T17:15:57.000Z,GailGV,Get this now!,This app is a necessity for anyone recently diagnosed. Instead of writing and carrying that log book everywhere you can use your phone. It shows you highs lows and I use to show my doctor my numbers. It is easy to use convenient and you can save your info.
700,700,5,2009-08-07T04:28:19.000Z,Heather76,A Great App for Your Life with Diabetes,I am so greatful for this app! I was just diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes and am still trying to find my footing a bit. This app has made tracking my pertinent medical information so much easier! I would recommend it to EVERYONE who needs to track their sugar and food information!
701,701,5,2011-09-04T16:11:56.000Z,Zombie Trooper,A must for all diabetics,This AP is a must for any diabetic of any type. I have Type 2 diabetes and the graph alone helps me keep track on how my levels are doing. Great for my doctor as well who doesn't have to bring up every day one at a time on my meter. With this AP everything is right there!
702,702,5,2011-09-24T01:17:52.000Z,I love my puppy!,Most Excellent,Keeping notes is good but with this app on my phone it's always at my fingertips!  By faithfully entering my readings I was able to see the graph and make better sense of my levels.
703,703,4,2011-11-03T03:58:25.000Z,HalHock,For simple tasks.,I am just using it as a log and graphing tool. That part works well. Some of the other features don't appeal to me. Setting notification reminders is broken for some parts and it won't remember my meter type. The fix is to create an account which really shouldn't be required or it should say as such.
704,704,3,2012-10-21T21:09:45.000Z,Dawakster,Pretty good,"Helps me keep track better than with a separate paper recorder. Wish there were built in food options with info and wish I had choices other than grams to record my intake. Would be nice if there were push reminders for testing (eg after a meal was recorded) or to take meds. Would also be nice to be able to set ""high"" and ""low"" according to my doctors recommendation."
705,705,5,2013-03-05T04:02:31.000Z,Aliassmith75,Easier Glucose Log,This app has made it so much easier to keep track of my blood sugar. Convenient - I can take it everywhere I go and enter blood sugar when ever (app even organizes my numbers.) And the graphs give me a clear picture of my blood sugar trends. Thanks for improving my self care monitoring.
706,706,4,2013-04-21T00:23:54.000Z,Cdog1790,Good App - could be better,"Don't like having to add my meds each time I make a log entry. Should only have to enter the name once and then just enter the dosages. Also, when you are entering a glucose reading, say before bed, and then want to enter a med, it goes back to the first description.  With a few minor changes it could be very good."
707,707,5,2014-01-31T23:39:10.000Z,Radrock,Need iPad app,I have used this for a considerable time.  I also have an iPad and think it would be even better if they had if for the iPad and the ability to keep them both in sync.  It sync's great with the internet so I'm sure it could work for an iPad as well.
708,708,5,2014-04-14T06:28:52.000Z,Travis212000,Works for me!,I'm a type one diabetic have been for 16 years this app has help me to monitor my blood glucose along with the food intake and insulin intake also my other medications can be put into this app helps me whenever not around to be able to write something down on paper and pencil.
709,709,5,2016-01-19T04:31:07.000Z,Mike3599,Works great for me,I've tried several other logs and keep coming back to Glucose Buddy. It does sync by my iphone to the computer. That really was a plus so I did not have to enter 94 entries from my phone to the web based site. I really cannot find a negative at this time.
710,710,5,2009-08-25T17:33:08.000Z,Blurf,Paying Attention to Details,These guys are doing these things right:
711,711,5,2011-07-27T23:46:26.000Z,Theron Johnson,Glucose Buddy,"Type 1 diabetic.  I love this app!  I use it every day to track my blood sugar readings and meds.  Data input couldn't be simpler.  I store all the logs on my iPhone; then, when my doctor wants to see my readings, all I have to do is hand him my phone and they are all there in both text and graph form."
712,712,5,2011-09-03T14:13:55.000Z,FacePro124,Glucose Buddy gets it right!,"Recently diagnosed Type2. After doing extensive research to find the perfect  App to help me ""stay on top"" of my blood glucose numbers I find Glucose Buddy the best! Informative, easy, and innovative. Can't wait to see what they come up with in the way of 'add-ond'. Would most definately recommend GB! It works for my busy lifestyle."
713,713,5,2012-07-16T20:56:54.000Z,cornfed,Love the features!,"Works well. I wish it would sync both ways. I have replaced my cell a couple times and lost historical graphing/logs. I have to browse in Safari to see the older data. Instead of showing the doc my phone, I have to take the laptop."
714,714,5,2012-10-10T13:47:32.000Z,Major3xs,Glucose buddy,Great app Really makes it easy to keep track of numbers on daily basis no more paper or forgetting to write it down. Easy-to-use And keeps track of results so I don't forget and I can see where I have been and where I am headed in my results Best thing since sliced bread
715,715,5,2012-10-10T22:01:09.000Z,iPuente,iHealthy!,"Since I started treating my diabetes with responsibility, I have developed a good and trusting relationship with my Doctor."
716,716,5,2012-10-29T14:18:20.000Z,_Sharon_,I use this app several times a day.,Have had type 1 diabetes for over 10 years and have been using this app for the past 2 years. Very easy to use. Doctor loves it and I never forget to bring my logs with me since they're on my phone.
717,717,4,2012-11-10T14:47:57.000Z,Bronze Star Vietnam,Great App...... But,I have to see my medication nurse every three months. She really likes the e-mailed readings. I have to delete the previous three months to start fresh. What a pain to delete each reading one at a time. THERE SHOULD BE A WAY T O DELETE A DATE RANGE. Work on it guys. I find it easier to delete the app and reinstall. Much quicker even if I have to redo my account info.
718,718,5,2014-07-10T14:01:27.000Z,BookKat,Great tracking tool!,I just needed a simple app for tracking glucose levels and this is very easy to use. The graphing features are great! The only recommendation I have is that I would like to sync both ways so I can have all my recent data on my devices.
719,719,4,2017-01-19T03:32:10.000Z,Jcs-t,"Pretty good basis, could use some tweaks.","Overall, this is a pretty good and useful app. It has a lot of good features and covers pretty much every thing one needs."
720,720,5,2011-09-11T17:24:35.000Z,DpwnZ,Awesome app,"Gotta say as a 20 year old, always on the go, type 1 diabetic just using this app for a week has improved my quality of life! Push reminders to check my sugars are a god send!!!!!! Currently using an insulin pump so combine this log book with a CGMS I'm hopefully getting and it'll be a god send!!"
721,721,5,2012-01-31T02:33:55.000Z,JJ Jackson,Great free app,"I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and have to test 4 times a day. This app is great for keeping up with my numbers. I like that I can add notes of what I ate with each entry to keep track of food triggers.  Also, my doc loves how easy it is to review my numbers at a glance.  The graph is a nice overview, too. No complaints here!"
722,722,4,2012-02-05T00:34:44.000Z,eekScientist,Sometimes won't synch,"Overall, this works as advertised. Sometimes it won't sync with my online account. That's on my home WiFi, so I don't know why. The calorie tracking app synch is not free (one-time fee), and I didn't pay for it because that app kept crashing. I like being able to email my log to myself."
723,723,5,2012-06-16T17:42:50.000Z,arielade,Awesome app!,"I don't have diabetes but my dog does, and I could not keep track of his food, exercise, insulin, and glucose curves without this app! When I take him to the vet I go online and print out his charts and logs, and he has all of the information. It's a perfect app and always works. It's never crashed."
724,724,5,2012-10-04T12:55:49.000Z,Thom1948,Glucose buddy is my buddy,"This program is fantastic.  Since my doctor has ""ordered"" me to keep records this is easy and does the job.  The app on my ipad and the iPhone while combined on the go and desktop at home is the way to go.  Keep up good work.  And keep it as easy as it is now."
725,725,5,2012-10-04T19:59:59.000Z,Ahartfie,Great app; just what I needed.,"Glucose Buddy let me banish the paper logbooks. I can track my BG and insulin very easily. Being able to download the data from the website is a huge benefit, as is being able to email from within the app. Give it a try; you won't regret it."
726,726,5,2012-10-17T06:30:47.000Z,MarinaThomas,Great,Love this program. Managing my sons type two diabetes.
727,727,5,2012-10-18T19:44:21.000Z,LeRoyNollette,Feesback,"My attraction to it was that it provided a date/time stamp to log all items but it keyed on the blood readings instead of the date/time. To use it, I use the notes to identify either blood readings or insulin. I would gladly offer my services to develop a set of requirements to best suit my needs."
728,728,5,2012-11-06T11:58:30.000Z,Ccpltech,Great App!!!,I love using this app. It fits my lifestyle better than a paper log. I don't have to worry about losing it. I like the fact that you can print out the logs and show them to your healthcare provider. I'm really thankful that they provide this service for free. Keep up the good work!

It allows me to view my results on a graph to see where I need to adjust my diet. If your serious about getting your blood sugar under control get this app. Highly recommend this app.
732,732,5,2011-08-12T18:47:49.000Z,Cluster cat,Must App,I became pre diabetic this year. I started watching the numbers and manually writing them down. I discovered this app through a friend and I have been using it since. I love the graph and the averages it puts out. I am a visual learner and these two things really motivates me to do better every day!
733,733,5,2012-03-06T02:54:30.000Z,Mspacone,Makes life easy...,"If you are a techno geek like me and carry your technology with you everywhere, it makes life easy to always be able to record results.

Whenever I go to my appts I just show her my entries on my phone.  I've also printed them out to go in my medical records. I highly recommend this app!
735,735,5,2012-11-09T02:32:31.000Z,Just Me Arlene,Better at record keeping,I used to carry a notebook in my bag until my friend introduced me to this app. So much more efficient.  I can actually keep track  & monitor my blood sugar levels & make the needed decision on how to lower or increase my sugar levels by food or exercise. Love it!
736,736,5,2013-08-18T11:02:59.000Z,Smiglydog,An aid to a new diabetic,Awesome app!!! I use it multiple times per day and it helps me learn to control my blood sugar.  It is an excellent way to share my blood sugar levels with my doctor. Thank you for creating this app! My only wish is for the ability to merge this app with a food diary.
737,737,5,2013-09-12T15:54:14.000Z,Old diabetic fart,Having fun logging my blood,So far this app has been great beats writing everything by hand and I can easily track and see where I need to improve.  My doctor will be please that she no longer needs to guess what I wrote down by hand anymore.
738,738,5,2016-03-12T00:57:02.000Z,Shannonlilia,"Simple, Easy & Convenient",Logs my levels quickly and easily and allow me a great way to share with my doctor. I was just diagnosed at the beginning of this month and this app helps make my life easy as I make major adjustments. Highly recommended!
739,739,3,2016-05-01T20:28:01.000Z,Mr. Shryer,Better than most,"It is better than the other glucose logging apps I could find, but it has problems.  The screen is too crowded. Even on a 6s+ you have to scroll to add more than one medication. The time of day tags don't carry over from tab to tab. You have to enter the amount of medicine (I.e. 20mg) each time, there is no way of setting a default."
740,740,4,2011-05-14T11:00:01.000Z,Steve Harksen,Engineer,"GB is an excellent tool to keep track of your blood sugar levels. I use it daily and print the data and graph to provide to my doctor. After 2 months of use, I can see a definite improvement in my eating habits. I have tried the 'integrated' calorie counter, feel that it needs some work. Bottom line - GB is a great app!"
741,741,4,2011-09-22T02:28:51.000Z,Sroberts03,Very Helpful,"Since my Gestational Diabetes diagnosis, I've found it to be very helpful to keep track of my numbers."

It's easy to use and understand. And it allows me to share this information with my doctor so that we can effectively manage my diabetes.
743,743,5,2012-01-24T13:21:12.000Z,Codius66,Outstanding!,"I was looking for something like a spreadsheet to keep track of my blood sugar in preparation for making the pus to get a pump... Well, I found this miracle app wit so much more! I love the blogs, the ease of data entry and the averages that it provides at a glance. I wish I'd had this on my ""palm pilot"" 10 years ago!"

745,745,5,2012-08-30T12:47:46.000Z,5ofud,Great app,This app has allowed me to track my bgl during gestational diabetes.  It is easy for my doctor to read and simple for me to use. I like that it links online as well. I have not used anything in it except the logs for tracking bgl so I can't speak for the rest of the app
746,746,5,2012-10-08T23:50:17.000Z,cyber553,Does It's Job Well!,"The app foes what it's supposed to do. It replaces my old log book and I always have the app on me so I can check A1c, dietary measures, etc all in one, easily searchable place!"

I especially love the ability to sync my logs to the website so all I have to do is pull it up and print it for my doctor visits! Great app!
748,748,5,2012-12-12T17:14:20.000Z,TiminPA,Easy to use,I have been using Glucose Buddy for approximately six weeks. It is extremely easy to use and logically set up. I love that I can test anywhere and not be concerned about remembering to log my reading on paper.  It is also useful for emailing the log to my physician.
749,749,5,2015-04-01T14:01:44.000Z,Happy Bunny 10,Love it.,Been using this app for a while now. I usually keep my b/s in a notebook and then just get tired of writing them down or just forget to. Sense I pretty much have my phone with me 24/7 I don't forget. I also started writing them down again.
750,750,4,2008-12-01T19:14:27.000Z,ewhaug,Ugly but useful,This app needs a cosmetic makeover to earn 5 stars --the icon and splash screen are absolutely terrible.
751,751,5,2009-05-20T12:02:49.000Z,Mike a golfer,Great app!!!!!',I am a type 1 and have been using this app for five months . Bottom line it has helped lower my a1c.

753,753,2,2010-11-21T14:31:26.000Z,Phoenix Wade,Don't get the update!,"I purchased the premium add on for this app ages ago, and the reason was to support the developer, not because I needed or wanted the add on.  I updated today, I have ads added to this app, and there is no way to remove them, event though I'm a premium customer.  I'm extremely unhappy about this. it dropped my rating of this app from 5 to 2 stars, and I'm off to find a different Glucose logger, unless the ads disappear really soon."
754,754,5,2011-05-24T18:47:12.000Z,dmzphd,Very Useful,"This app does just what is needed to manage a disease that requires accurate record keeping. I use it daily and rely on the summaries to keep my physician up on my progress. The updates are very much appreciated, since i've used this app for many of the 16+ years with this diagnosis."
755,755,4,2011-11-02T13:21:01.000Z,Orion18,Great!!,I would give this five stars but for the week I've been using it I have failed to connect to the server on two different days due to server issues.  I am currently pre-diab so I'm only checking once a day. If I was doing this more often and needing to track more info I would  definitely pay for the add ons.
756,756,5,2012-10-08T11:42:32.000Z,Kquilts,Great app!,"I use this app daily, so much better than my daily log book.  I can almost predict what my A1c will be by my numbers.  I love that it syncs with the website, so data is always safe. Tracking carbs and activity as well can help me see what is affecting my numbers. Great job GB!"
757,757,3,2013-03-24T13:59:24.000Z,MerlinEmmettEmrys,Review-O.k.,"It's alright for the most part. I like how I can see my blood sugars over the past time and it provides me with a clear and easy graph to show my Doctors, but it logs my account out a lot of the time and then proceeds to tell me I don't have one, so I'm constantly having to make a new one and I lose all my data with my old ones, which is a problem and a pain for my Doctors."
758,758,5,2015-03-24T21:21:56.000Z,Ell26409,Love it,Have to monitor for gestational. Love the fact the app is so easy to use and keep up with everything especially while I am at work. I also like that it has different settings to show if you're type 1/2 or gestational.
759,759,4,2016-08-06T12:20:17.000Z,LT-LC,Easy to use and helpful to track blood sugar levels,This app is easy to use and helpful with tracking my levels and then easily being able to show them to my doctor. The only thing it doesn't do that I wish it did was send me alerts to test.
760,760,4,2012-01-01T02:23:12.000Z,devilboy3413,Love App But NO Intragration,"Downloaded App 2wks ago, love it. Does all I want it too. Only problem is  integrating w/CalorieTracker!! CalorieTracker CONSTANTLY CRASHES & isn't worth its services. Rite now I wouldn't recommend this Add-In. I'm surprised no one else has complained bout this problem. CalorieTracker's reviews really reflect this problem. Otherwise I highly recommend this Apps usage!!"
761,761,4,2012-04-29T16:05:08.000Z,James Bolden,Glucose Buddy,This application has allowed me to manage diabetes more efficiently in my busy life. Before I started using this app I did not know where I stood or what was happening inside my body. I now have a better understanding of how my body reacts to my caloric intake and medicine. I gave it 4 stars because I have not yet signed up for all functions yet.
762,762,5,2012-07-26T12:56:43.000Z,Naneve70,Great app to help monitor blood glucose!,I really like this app I just wish I could email my Dr my logs directly from my iPhone. Also it would be great to change the log sort feature/style. Over all I would definitely recommend this app for diabetics.
763,763,5,2012-09-09T18:25:45.000Z,AliciaA04,Love this app,I have been pre-diabetic and during my pregnancy I know have diabetes. Been using this app to send my blood sugars to my doctors office and I love it. So much easier than hand writing all my readings and faxing it in. Wish there was a way to record carbs eaten at each meal though.
764,764,4,2012-10-05T16:35:47.000Z,a.baker,Great for keeping a newbie on track,I just found out I was type two in April. The app has made it easy to keep me honest and in track. I would have given it 5 stars but the program calorie tracker that they push for a fee doesn't work and always crashes.
765,765,5,2013-03-10T08:50:07.000Z,J Dub Jr,Awesome app!!!,"This app has been very useful tome. It encourages me towards maintaining good blood glucose (BG) levels as well as maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  There is even a support group Forum where you can ask questions, receive answers & share your experience(s) with other diabetics. Best price too!!  üòÉ"
766,766,1,2013-06-14T16:08:54.000Z,CHPC Chaplain Tom,Poor support or activation fix,"I have been struggling trying to activate my account. I've sent in a coupe emails and spent a few hours trying to work through this. Very dissatisfied with app. It is useless without being able to send your blood sugars to your doctor. I have gotten NO response from support. Very dissatisfied! I even have the Pro version but neither activates! Thought this would be simple to fix. However, without contact from support, fix won't happen."
767,767,3,2014-08-03T12:33:23.000Z,JackieMulroy,Inconsistency / Inability to Sync,It's almost as if the person responsible for the server is not awake when I am going to test my blood. I never seem to be able to sync with the server for hours or even days after I have logged my results. I've yet to try downloading and/or printing off my results to take to my doctor but I will keep you posted!
768,768,4,2014-10-05T13:59:22.000Z,JessyEric,Best FREE app ever!,"Love that this app doesn't limit your input like some other free apps cap off how many log entries you can make. Gave it only 4 stars because weight should be included & although you can enter food, the app doesn't log the nutrition like some others do... Just carbs (that you have to manually enter)!"
769,769,4,2016-01-25T10:49:56.000Z,MelissaLynnn,Great help,This app has helped me to take my blood sugar readings more often. It is so easy to keep track and the graph is nice to see an overall look at how I am doing. I also like the email link. I am able to just email my readings directly to my Doctors office. I would definitely suggest this to others.
770,770,1,2009-11-22T05:31:32.000Z,KYIndigo,Bring back the graphs,I use this app daily. The reason I keep it over other glucose-monitoring apps was the graph which quickly could show me and my doctor whether my fasting glucose was in the controlled range. I unfortunately have to add to the chorus of other reviews that I will likely switch to another app unless the graphing ability is added back to the program. My physician was considering telling other diabetics about this app solely for the graphing capabilities. Please bring back the graphs.
771,771,5,2011-05-20T02:59:08.000Z,snakecitygirl,The Everyday 5 star app,"Every day, 3 to 5 times a day I test and then I enter my BG #s in here, my weight in here, at every meal my Carbs in here ... everything goes in here & everything syncs with my PC and there I print out graphs for my doctor.  Works great, crashes are extremely rare ... it's the best I've found."
772,772,3,2011-05-22T15:35:30.000Z,Ngsgoddess,Does the job,I use this app to record my gl while I'm dealing with gestational diabetes. The food chart doesn't save so I put my food in the notes section of my test results. The program tends to freeze up on occasion or kicks me out of the program which is annoying but overall it does what I need it to do and I love that it syncs to the net and that I can print off the spreadsheet.
773,773,5,2011-05-30T21:58:29.000Z,Suzi9197,Very helpful tool!,"I have not been using Glucose Buddy for very long, but I use it all the time now.  I have been recently diagnosed with Type I Diabetes and it is very helpful to have one place to keep track of everything: blood sugar testing, medications, and food.  Thank you!"
774,774,5,2012-05-26T18:15:16.000Z,missyyclaire,Easy,"I just use the basic features and this little app works great for me. After 5 months of low carb eating, I showed my Doc my sugar numbers stored in this app on my phone. Not only did he like tha app, but he liked my readings enough to take me off me medication!"
775,775,5,2012-10-05T14:33:17.000Z,RedNaxel99,Very useful apps...!!!,"I am very happy having this apps. I have been using it for almost 2 years, I every day to keep my glucose records updated. My life is easier since I found it, especially for the graph and the web link features."
776,776,5,2012-10-09T17:23:29.000Z,lavenderladyme,Great for keeping track,"As a newly diagnosed diabetic, I find this app perfect for helping me keep track of everything in one place.  I especially like that it syncs to my Mac so that when I am online 8 can access the info w/ out having to pull out my iPad."
777,777,4,2012-12-30T17:47:10.000Z,Anonymous54321!,"Great glucose monitoring app, could be even better",I really like this app. It is well thought out and easy to use. One thing that would make it better would be if you could set an alarm to remind you to test your blood sugar after eating. Thanks to the devs for making my life easier!
778,778,5,2013-02-22T04:33:33.000Z,Tissy2981,Love it!!!!,"Have it on my pc, tablet, and iPhone so no matter when or where I'm able to update and keep track. Hoping the sync option for the tablet will come soon so I can sync all 3 together to keep them all the same. :)"
779,779,4,2016-10-02T19:10:56.000Z,sgarrison05,Great App,"I really like the design of this app. Not sure about the online syncing. I want to be reassured about security of medical records. Would rather it sync to Dropbox or something or the like. Also, you can move icons around but the go back after you exit the app.  Needs to be permanent if I customize it."
780,780,4,2010-05-21T00:28:14.000Z,NaThemba,Great helper!,I was never so keen about keeping up with logs until I found this app. The ability to graph within the app and take snapshots impresses my med team - but not as much as being able to log into an online system and get a more comprehensive report. That sort of upgrade is on my wish list.
781,781,5,2011-11-17T16:59:54.000Z,TJthePreach,Extremely Helpful,"This app is essential, especially for a Mac user, since most of the desktop applications for linking a glucose monitor with a computer are for PC only. The log-in feature allows me to show my doctor my day to day struggles and victories."
782,782,3,2012-04-27T09:20:19.000Z,Russell The Organizer,Need A Real iPad Version,iPhone application is very handy. Graphing and layout of emailed logs could be improved could be improved and export ability be added. Biggest complaint is not having an app designed for the iPad which took advantage of the larger screen. I wasted $13 buying the sync app because of the lack of a real iPad app. $13 a year to sync is excessive. Still a 3 star rating.
783,783,4,2012-10-06T02:41:09.000Z,Amateur not an artist,The best of the bunch,After running a copy of every glucose tracking app there was in the store this was the best one there is. The graphs online are exactly what my Dr. needs to see. No extra data to enter to see my data in the groupings I need.
784,784,5,2012-10-08T13:04:23.000Z,OCD for time!,Easy way to keep up!,"All I need is a way to dump my new meter Verio IQ into this, and I need for nothing!  This ap is very friendly to use.  Once you do the legwork of entering all your meds and a month of food as you go; it all is as easy as a click every day!"
785,785,3,2012-10-30T16:23:18.000Z,Briman63,Gets the job done,"It's an ok app. Fairly straightforward to use, but is a bit slow to load data into and a bit annoying that you need to upload to their server to complete the tracking process (server is often not available). I can use it, but am trolling to see if there is something better."
786,786,4,2014-06-27T14:22:27.000Z,Rockindogs,"Great so far, but computer site needs work",So far this app is working great. However using glucose buddy online on my computer is not so great. I am trying to enter my logs and it keeps locking up and I have to refresh and I lose data. Very frustrating. Hopefully this will be fixed.
787,787,5,2014-10-22T15:04:23.000Z,JHitchEsq,Great way to keep track of GD!,It's so simple to keep track of my numbers with this app.  My doctor can look at them right on my phone.  It is so nice not having to haul around sheets of paper and a pen everywhere.  I know I always have my phone on hand!
788,788,3,2016-01-08T01:02:13.000Z,Listen9876599,Loss about 15 months of data,"A few days ago, the app disappeared from my phone for some unknown reason. I was able to download the app again, but my log wasn't recovered. Otherwise, a higher rating would have been given. I email the log to myself weekly, but a few days of numbers were lost."
789,789,1,2017-09-06T07:38:31.000Z,Seattle Puzzle Fan,No longer supported,"A great app. I've used it for years but it hasn't been updated or supported for a few years. I doesn't sync with Apple Health or other recent apps. And now I'm getting notices from Apple that it will not run on iOS 11 if it's not updated, so it will soon become useless. It's really too bad because it's so easy to use. Very frustrating that there doesn't appear to be anybody home in customer support or IT. If they update it, it would be 5 stars."
790,790,2,2009-03-30T17:38:19.000Z,FamousNick,Can't email log entries,"At first this handy app seemed flawless, but after adding over 100 log entries, it's lost the ability to email them. Unfortunately this has rendered all of my careful logging useless to my doctor. Oh well. I suppose this app is still helpful if you are not being carefully monitored by your doctor, but since I need to give my logs to my health care professional, I will need to look for another solution."
791,791,5,2010-01-08T23:06:32.000Z,GBAdvocate,Doctor Approval,My new doctor remembers me as the one with the neat IPhone app on which I show him my logs and graphs. He wishes all his patients used it as he can quickly see my records and give me instructions on insulin dosage as we try to lower my Type II levels in two week intervals.
792,792,5,2011-05-14T21:51:16.000Z,Tomcat4370,Awesome!!!!,Love it! I didnt mind testing but logging was a pain in the a##.
793,793,5,2011-11-09T06:30:30.000Z,bottledskyy,Love this app!!!,"This app helps organize everything so perfectly , I brought it in to show the history to the endocrinologist and even he was amazed. He said were doing a great job and appreciated everything being organized so well. Thanks for a great app!!!"
794,794,5,2012-06-06T10:04:03.000Z,JustJerry,Great App!,"This app gives you an easy and effective way to track blood glucose! It's a little pricey when you buy the premium services, but ultimately worth the convenience. The calorie tracker app crashes every time and isn't worth the effort!"
795,795,4,2012-06-07T13:25:46.000Z,JenDanahy,Helps with keeping track and sending in #,This app is really helpful for me. This is my second bout with gestational diabetes and I am require to fax or call in my numbers weekly to my RN. This app allows me to email then in. Us the notes section helps me keep track of food so we can change my diet as needed.
796,796,5,2013-01-10T13:59:32.000Z,LadyGiGi8,Great App!!,"I used to record my readings in a notebook and then on Saturdays, transfer that data  to a spreadsheet . This APP has replaced those manual methods and I'm able to immediately upload my data and print out reports/lists to share with my doctor.  I love it!"
797,797,5,2013-04-25T10:40:01.000Z,Juju boop,Great,"I really enjoy this app! It makes noting my BG easier! It's easy to use & set up! I like being able to note when I took it, the time of day & any other info I need to note.  I highly recommend this app for any diabetics that test often."
798,798,4,2013-06-17T15:38:56.000Z,Bryswall,Great overall,Great app that certainly helps show your sugars over time. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is I wish you could look at sugars in a linear timeline not just highest lowest and average of the day. Would also be cool to be able to sort by type of sugar (ex: before lunch or out of bed etc). But it's great!
799,799,5,2016-12-29T12:40:38.000Z,Huey683,Great tool,"I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and I looked for an app to help me track my levels. This app is great for managing your gl, food and much more. I downloaded several other apps, but this one does the most and is very easy to use."
800,800,5,2008-11-22T04:22:28.000Z,mustafa_b,Best of all monitoring apps I've seen,I've been using it for about a month and it works well.  Tech support is responsive and helpful.  I inquired about modifying the email function so it will send only a selected range of dates.  They say this is coming.
801,801,3,2009-11-19T10:31:29.000Z,CntrySngr,Used to be five stars...,"Don't get me wrong, the update is nice, I've never had a problem with it crashing either. My complaint: they took the graphs away.  Give them back and this would be a five star rating. I use it daily, but like others have said, my Dr and I prefer to use the graph for tracking. I hope they get that 'fixed' ASAP!!!!"
802,802,5,2011-05-26T12:36:26.000Z,Cindy Hammonds,Glucose Buddy,I really enjoy using Glucose Buddy because it helps me stay accountable. I'm happy to have it on my phone because I have great difficulty keeping up with paper logs. Now I have it with me at all times.  I still need to learn how to use all of the features
803,803,5,2011-11-26T00:02:34.000Z,Ashroxthemic,Great,I have a family history of diabetes and this is one of the simplest ways to keep track of it. I have to watch my sugar because of hypoglycemia and even encouraged my grandmother to download it on her iPhone.. She loves the ease as well!! Highly recommend
804,804,5,2011-12-11T02:01:33.000Z,Hughes4075,Great tool,"As a recently diagnosed person, this tool is helping me get into the habit of tracking my blood glucose levels.  I have not scratched the surface of its capability, but I use what I need today.  I'll get to the other capability later.  I'm pleased with the product.  Try it!"
805,805,5,2012-01-01T01:01:31.000Z,Da Poppa,Lencrabb,"I have had diabetes for over 15 years, and this has given me a terrific insight of the relationship of insulin and food intake and their effect on my blood sugar.  My doctor is thrilled with the charts I give him when i visit him."
806,806,5,2012-10-04T15:18:26.000Z,Lpp5,Awesome App,This is the best app I have. I was just diagnosed with diabetes and this helps me keep track of what is working and what isn't. So easy to get the logs to show and impress my doctor. A must have for any diabetic. My doctor is very happy to have this organized neat information.
807,807,5,2012-12-18T19:32:20.000Z,Asatj,Glucose buddy,This app is amazing before finding this app I had not controlled my blood sugars very well and once I started using the app I have done well in monitoring my blood sugars. I had slacked off and now I am back on it and this app will keep me going. Thank you glucose buddy.
808,808,5,2013-01-10T13:51:22.000Z,RonMasato,Review,"User friendly for the most part; would like the capability to e-mail graphs and data to interested parties such as physicians, et al.  Print out capability would be good, too."

Then I don't have to keep asking him over again. I'm a little confused about how to enter meds and exercise, though, thus the 4 star rating."

The graphs are very unhelpful for me, and the program that you can integrate food data from continually crashes my phone, so is not a helpful feature either. otherwise great!"
814,814,5,2012-03-22T14:10:32.000Z,JanuineC,Love this app!,This program has been invaluable in helping me to keep track of my blood sugar readings.  Love that I can look it up on the website as well.  Also keeps track of my blood pressure and weight. Worth every penny.  Well done.

817,817,5,2015-05-04T12:10:18.000Z,Dragion7,Couldn't be happier with this app,I needed something to record my sugar multiple times a day and this app is perfect to record not just my sugar but what I ate as well. So pleased I don't have to carry a paper around and just use my phone.
818,818,5,2016-03-24T16:29:54.000Z,LeiazMami,Great Way to Log my Results,I used this app a few years back and I wasn't able to sync anything. But now they seem to have fixed all the issues I had before and it works great for me.
819,819,5,2017-04-18T15:53:41.000Z,Smenna,Not so sure anymore,Just got notified that this app needs to be undated.  The developer needs to update the app or it won't work with newer versions of iOS. And to think I spent money to go pro. Might have to change apps.
820,820,5,2009-07-02T08:22:06.000Z,EmpressLizzie,Great App!,"I REALLY love this app! It has helped me keep track of my Diabetes. One suggestion though, I'm Type 2, but I don't use insulin, I use oral medications to control my BG. I would like to be able to keep track of my pills, (i.e dosage,) in the medication section. Otherwise, it's perfect!"
821,821,5,2009-12-22T18:33:56.000Z,Colby42,Great tool for Diabetics,Just got this App.  I have been struggling with my sugars and this gives me great information on where my highs and lows are.  The graphs and charts are 1st rate.  I feel like I am armed with enough information to make intelligent decisions with my doctor on wha we can do to lower my A1C
822,822,4,2011-05-14T18:56:09.000Z,Lrebzus,Great!,Overall I really enjoy using glucose buddy.  It is really easy to use.  My only complaint is that I don't like the graph.  I don't understand it. However the maps online are much easier to read and understand. So I would highly suggest synching it and going online.

825,825,4,2012-09-12T18:12:20.000Z,billmcbain,Works great,Gives me just what I need to give doctor my info. Would be nice of it had push notification or alarm to remind you about specific meal time or to nudge you of you hadn't entered a number in x# of hours / days. Also would be nice if it assumed the category based on time of day.

The ""Testing in Pairs"" let's you see the effect of something you do or what you eat, on your blood sugar. That information helps you make good choices.

831,831,3,2011-06-24T09:14:17.000Z,Sky raider5791,An old fart,My doctor was very impressed when I showed her my blood sugars for the last two weeks.  I plan on using your program in future.  Thank you for providing it's use.  Perhaps a graphic presentation with recommended blood sugar levels wold be helpful also.  My IPad blood sugar recording chart has such a graph and is very good on giving me the trends.  thank you!
832,832,4,2012-06-16T12:10:06.000Z,Tuscany Ted,Great app but room for improvement,App makes it easy to keep track of my bs if it doesn't hang up. Frustrating when it won't sync with their server. Notifications not working at all. Fix all the small annoying bugs and it's a 5 star app.
833,833,5,2012-10-04T20:31:51.000Z,rgaustad,Glucose Buddy,I remain impressed by the functionality of this app and the reporting capabilities of the website. A truly great app.
834,834,5,2012-10-12T14:39:24.000Z,Richie1242,Glucose buddy,This is one of the best apps that I have down loaded. I have all my BG readings  at a glance. I'm able to send to my computer and then print it out and bring    the print out to my doctor or I can show by BG readings right from the phone.
835,835,5,2012-10-14T00:50:49.000Z,Arkansassy Sue,Glucose Buddy,Since finding out 6.5 months ago that I have type 2 diabetes I have used Glucose Buddy daily to track my progress in getting a handle on this disease that was out of control. I would be lost without it!!
836,836,5,2012-12-10T11:54:03.000Z,2leftfeet92105,Glucose Buddy,I love this app! It's so easy to use. I also add my weight in the notes section. Now I'm able to track my weight and glucose in one location. I no longer have to search my house for the paper log I kept.
837,837,5,2012-12-18T18:27:27.000Z,Spoat,Nothing better yet.,I've tried a couple of these and this on seems to be the best so far. Although I always have the feeling something better could be done.
838,838,5,2013-08-19T02:41:48.000Z,Jenna Lawren,Awesome for a busy diabetic who doesn't like to keep a logbook,"I love this!!!! I'm sooo busy lately and I always forget my logbook, but I bring my iPod everywhere with me!!! I love it and so do my parents and doctor. He can track what my sugar us doing by the graphs. It is truly a masterpiece!!!!!"
839,839,5,2013-08-31T21:26:05.000Z,Abather Almajedi,awesome app,"It's very cool app because I don't have to write on paper anymore. It give me what I need however it's little restriction for me because I want to make my own label (out of bed, before breakfast etc. I want to put ""low sugar"" or like that."
840,840,5,2011-05-18T12:19:27.000Z,Gccgc,GB,I love the fact that I can also keep track of weight and blood pressure. Thus makes it easy to show all the information to my doctor all in one place. I like that I can e-mail him that same information.
841,841,5,2011-05-21T21:04:16.000Z,sneedski,My most use App.......*****,"My BG level in July, 2010 was 498 with A1C 16.5. I went to VA Medical for 10 days. After the stay, I started using this App and I swear by it. With the Doctors help, eating right and daily use of this after 3 months my BG average is 124.5 and my A1C is 6.4. I was taking 7 shots a day to now 0.  I love it!"
842,842,5,2011-05-30T12:25:26.000Z,Tammyb17,Does what I need,"Although this app looks like it has a lot of cool features, it's still simple enough where I can simply record my readings. I am only ""watching"" my blood sugar per the recommendation of my OB (though not diabetic), and this is perfect. Thanks!"
843,843,5,2011-07-04T00:24:37.000Z,James5252,Excellent,The first program of it's type I can happily use without cables and a degree in computer science. Like the chart feature. Please make a version for the iPad and I would be happy to pay for a version without ads.
844,844,5,2011-09-15T14:46:27.000Z,Wendy Bradford,Mrs,I like how I can see all my readings at the same time and compare them.  O can see what foods make my numbers increase and use it as a guide to determine what foods are not good for me.  My doctor loves how she can see everything in one place with my notes.  I love it.
845,845,4,2012-10-14T18:00:06.000Z,GATJ1,Glucose Buddy Review,Used GB for the past 4 months. I enter everything from my phone and then sync to my computer. Easy to use. Easy to sync. Provides great data and charts for doctor visits generated by the computer. I highly recommend this App for people trying to manage their diabetes.
846,846,4,2014-10-28T01:55:21.000Z,Sugar Pig,Solid,"Does the basics very very well, and that's a huge step"
847,847,4,2014-12-28T15:15:15.000Z,JennRiCar,Easy to use,I just started using this app. I like it so far. It's easy to use and I like the notes function because I can add what I ate that made my readings high/low. I wish it had a timer to alert me when I need to test myself after meals. I will continue using this app.
848,848,5,2015-10-14T13:11:19.000Z,Candlinz,Easy to use,Like the fact that you can sync and then download your numbers to a file which can be imported into Excel.  I used this to print out my numbers for my doctor.
849,849,5,2017-05-07T12:24:59.000Z,Ctocm-aw,Needs an update to current IOS.,Apple pop ups about once a month saying this app will cause issues unless it gets updated to the current IOS version.
850,850,4,2009-01-28T15:14:13.000Z,Emmett H.,Solid application; responsive developer,"Very clean initial application. Contacted the developer about some questions and suggestions, and heard back right away. They're already working on pretty much everything I was wondering about for the next update. Highly recommended."
851,851,5,2010-01-09T04:08:49.000Z,fernv,great app,This app is a great tool to help one stay in control. Love the graph and the ability to email my logs to my self and my doctor to keep track of my progress. This makes it easy for one to stay on top and stay in control.
852,852,5,2011-05-26T16:07:37.000Z,Gary Yingling,Tattletales,"Glucose Buddy keeps me honest by tracking my numbers and keeping it ""in my face.""  It is one of the most necessary apps on my iPad and not only a motivator for keep my diabetes in check, but for me to control my diet, my weight and my overall physical condition.  Thanks ""Buddy""!"
853,853,5,2011-09-25T18:22:40.000Z,Cartel dude 90,Amazing for diabetics,Pretty much what everyone else is saying is true! No more using a real logbook or paper just pull your phone out of your pocket takes literally 15 seconds and your done
854,854,5,2012-03-31T03:08:02.000Z,Fred Urrutia,Type 2 using insulin,"Started taking insulin in late February and Glucose Buddy has been invaluable to me for tracking carbs, insulin and glucose levels, making it easier to get myself under the best control I've had in years. Simply awesome!"
855,855,4,2012-10-04T12:02:49.000Z,Reasonable Words,Solid app. Needs to be iPad ready,Great app. Does what it advertises and more. Hope the developers create an iPad ready version.
856,856,4,2013-05-05T22:55:54.000Z,Cloverblade,Organization fix,The app itself is great and I give it 4 stars for that. I love being able to keep my logs in an app that than transfers to the online database. But one problem..the organization of the logs is horrible. The organization really needs fixed. Please..please work on it.
857,857,5,2013-08-02T23:25:33.000Z,Ladybug5468,If your diabetic...you NEED this app,This app is so easy to use and fast to update long term data in my desktop and then provide useful info to my dr by either email or printed graphs and reports.  This app is a must for easy management of diabetes
858,858,5,2014-01-19T14:14:02.000Z,Sue A W,Wonderful Ap. For your phone.,I recently downloaded this ap. I find it very easy to use. It is a must have for anyone that has diabetes. People always have their phone with them.  Very easy to pull up to show the Dr.
859,859,5,2014-05-05T05:26:38.000Z,DLFlyCub,Fantastic App,"This app does an amazing job in tracking my activities. Putting everything in a graph is the perfect way of monitoring your diabetic progress. And it's so easy. If you can text, you can easily use this app."
860,860,5,2011-09-10T13:45:34.000Z,Pearlish,Excellent App,"This is the best diabetes tracking app available. Easy interface, user friendly, and syncs quickly. You can add notes to a log entry, and it's easy to delete duplicate entries. This is one app that I couldn't live without."
861,861,3,2012-02-08T17:43:41.000Z,Chris 5363,"Good, could be Great","One tweak would greatly improve its user-friendliness.  My # 1 gripe:  why does the time label default to ""Out of Bed,"" even at night or after I've labeled other entries as ""after dinner"" or other categories?"
862,862,5,2012-02-25T12:15:08.000Z,Alaboom19,Love this app,It has made it very easy to log my readings into it for tracking it rather than having to through my meter.  I only wish it had a better graph depicting the information.
863,863,4,2012-03-14T14:04:15.000Z,Newly diagnosed 2/12,Very helpful,"This app is great for keeping quick, easy track of your numbers. The graph is great but seems a bit limited. I wish I could manipulate the data more. I'd like to be able to graph individual components ie out of bed, or before dinner.  Overall it's been very helpful."
864,864,5,2012-09-03T13:38:09.000Z,Grammacansew,Awesome app!!,"So glad I found this app. Very handy dandy because I can use it where ever I am. Best part is I can snap shot the graph and text or email it to my Dr. So easy to use, my 5 & 8 yr old granddaughters enter my results. If you're diabetic, this is a must have!!!!"
865,865,5,2012-10-12T14:56:15.000Z,Samwise'sSon,This app works,"Not only can I keep track of blood sugar, but with a little tweaking to some of the items, you can track meds and weight. For free! Get real folks, this app is just about as good as it can get."
866,866,5,2013-09-26T02:07:50.000Z,KAT Kateygirl,Diabetic,Great aid to keep track of my Diabetes. I use it thee times a day.  I like the graph to see an overview of the numbers.  I can show the doctor my phone because I always for get my log book.  I always have my phone.
867,867,3,2014-04-03T19:02:31.000Z,thpope,Hasn't been updated for awhile,OK for recording and getting trends but does not flag patterns. I hesitate to pay because of the long time between updates. Recording carbs could be better like remembering previous carb count and allowing exchanges instead of grams. Needs to have different graphs/log view such as by time or days.
868,868,2,2014-09-26T23:49:04.000Z,CalebC,Painfully Outdated,"This thing is in serious need of an update. It *still* hadn't been updated to support 4"" screens yet. That means it's written for 3.5"" screens which Apple doesn't even sell anymore. It's embarrassing. I would gladly pay good money for a modern up-to-date version of the app; especially if it took advantage of the new HealthKit APIs."
869,869,5,2014-10-19T14:26:39.000Z,MikeG347,Great app!!,Ever since I downloaded this app I've had a much better handle on monitoring and controlling my diabetes.  It's so convenient to have this info so readily available.  My doctor appreciates that she can check my progress at a glance.
870,870,3,2009-11-20T02:20:59.000Z,Bill plank,"Was a great app,, now not so much",These sort of updates usually come about because there is a new boss on the team...
871,871,5,2011-05-04T13:21:45.000Z,buzzkill1958,Easy to use,"Easy to use and sync between my iPhone, iPad, and the web site. My only complaint is against the web site. It should support the same units the application provides."
872,872,4,2011-05-22T02:08:21.000Z,AgathaApple,Use it all the time,"I keep a paper log book, but I also use this app. I like the graphs and being able to sync it to the web site. I would like to do a two-way sync without paying so much. I haven't bought that feature."
873,873,2,2011-05-22T16:39:56.000Z,JaggerRoo,Delete log entries,"This is a GOOD app. I have been using it since it first came out. However it would be a GREAT app if you can add some of the iPhone's native features such as ""edit, select and delete"" so we can delete some log entries on my iPhone. Right now, we can only do one at a time. To do so, you have to click each entry and then click delete. You can't even swipe to delete."
874,874,4,2011-06-26T02:49:56.000Z,Getnskny,Good app,"I use this app daily. It is a great way to keep track of blood sugar. I send reports via email to doctor. This makes it easy and convenient to stay on top of. One suggestion: because many diabetics have CKD Perhaps you could list all vitamins, minerals and other vital information"
875,875,4,2011-06-30T11:52:03.000Z,Preach_eesh,Love it!,I've been a type 1 diabetic since 1991. For 20 years I've hoped that there was a quick and easy way to record BG's. It is the best way to make sense of your patterns and trends with hi's and lo's and seeing keeps things balanced and pushing things to the limit.
876,876,5,2011-07-14T01:53:06.000Z,Notthe0nly1,Works well,"This has been very helpful with keeping trackof my numbers, and medications. And I really like being able to print just what I need to show my doctor, rather than my badly handwritten notes."
877,877,5,2014-01-27T03:31:16.000Z,Elizabeth Tucker,Really helped me!,I'm 16 and terrible at managing my diabetes and this really helped! Especially since I'm always on my phone anyways so I always see it and never forget to use it! Definitely would recommend!
878,878,4,2016-05-13T21:09:59.000Z,Susie Vue,Great free app,This app makes it really easy for me to track my sugar levels. I appreciate how easy it is to use and how easy it was to sync to my computer. I just wish you didn't have to pay extra to use some of the other features.
879,879,5,2016-07-03T19:17:54.000Z,Abdu Nur,Excellent!,"This app is very convenient and that's exactly what I was looking for...convenience. Also, it's not cluttered with a bunch of extras that I don't need. I'm still contemplating upgrading to the paid version but I should have a decision soon."
880,880,5,2010-07-05T17:19:35.000Z,Dale9276,Bs,Love this app easy to use abl to mail to your self or to your doctor. I just started checking my levers daily and this helps so much.  Thank you for making a app that helps much that is easy to use daily
881,881,4,2010-09-06T00:25:20.000Z,Sportyxlh883,Just got it,"Just got it, looks great. Hopefully never need to enter BGL over 500, but that should be fixed. If my previous review gets posted, the time problem was mine. It was right there in front of me, i missed it. Need to give it a good workout. Like the Testing in Pairs info on glucose testing."
882,882,5,2011-05-17T17:24:54.000Z,DOWNGRADE!!!!,DOWNGRADEÓê°Óê°Óê°,Very good app until I upgraded to 3.6.5. Now it takes forever to load and crashes frequently. The ads on the bottom maybe the culprit. What a disappointment. I should never have upgraded. It was more or less a DOWNGRADE.
883,883,5,2011-06-15T02:39:51.000Z,Tharpie57,GB great product,I have been using this product for about 5 months and it is great for keeping track of my glucose level as oppose to writing it down. This help to eliminate one item from my glucose monitoring kit. Keep up the good work.
884,884,5,2011-12-04T17:08:27.000Z,Madebad,Madebad,"Using to track blood sugar and BP. So far it has been excellent due to convenience, ease of use, and multiple input parameters. Looking forward to using more features and providing my doc with a thorough history. Fantastic app!"
885,885,3,2011-12-21T19:49:18.000Z,gankymcdoodleson,Would be okay...,It's a great idea and the way things are organized in it is good. But for some reason I can't choose my meter type (it just keeps switching back to the top selection) and I can't even tap some of the things to ad info. Someone needs to fix these problems and I'll give it 5 starts.
886,886,4,2011-12-28T06:43:42.000Z,AceOfBirds,App is so helpful!,"I love that I can get rid of my lil paper notebook that I used to track all of this exact info with before! It is very handy and helpful. Also, I love the fact that it acknowledges Type 1.5 (LADA). I was diagnosed with Type 1.5 almost 3 years ago at 25. It is rare that this type is recognized!"
887,887,5,2012-10-11T20:11:27.000Z,Slcshopaholic,Perfectly Simple,I love how easy it is to keep track of my blood sugar.  My meter is a mini and a log book just does not fit inside it's case. This app is great for keeping track of  everything.
888,888,5,2013-01-30T22:07:10.000Z,iWNDSRF,"Great App, helps keeping on track!",I love this app.  Now I can better track my progress and get motivated to do my best in keeping my BG under control.
889,889,4,2013-03-05T18:51:36.000Z,Hockeyallie,Great helper,"I love that it has access to blogs with other diabetic members. I like the easy to log features, the only thing to improve might be the amount of words you are aloud to put in the notes section. Definitely a big help overall!"
890,890,5,2009-08-03T00:39:57.000Z,alohaoba,Great app,"I use 3 different meters (work, home, car) so it's nice that I can enter all readings into my iPod and have them all together.  This app helped me significantly lower evening glucose simply by changing time not dosage of oral med and did this while on 2 week road trip."
891,891,5,2010-01-01T17:42:30.000Z,Mischloss,Love the online syncing,Been using this app for 3 days and love how easy it is to use. Best part is that it syncs to a free online database where u can view graphs and print them out! Using this app to keep track of my son's bg numbers.
892,892,5,2011-11-29T18:50:52.000Z,Cool app***,Great app,I was just diagnosed with diabetes and have to test my sugar three times a day.i love that it is so handy and that I can print out my readings for my doctor. I use more than one Meter to test so having all my readings in one place is good. Very good app for free.
893,893,5,2012-01-08T23:58:27.000Z,DavidE1010,LOVE THIS APP!!!!!,This App has been a big help in getting my A1C down to where it should be.

895,895,4,2012-09-24T22:05:33.000Z,6262836283,Quick and easy,"Sometimes it may be a little too complicated, and also there should be a daily calendar in which you can see blood sugars at different times during the day in a timeline format"
896,896,5,2012-11-27T09:36:07.000Z,Jan Dominy,Thanks!,I have just started to monitor and this is an easy way to record things.  I like reading the forums.  Since I'm new to Diabetes it's nice to be able to read stories from other people like me.

899,899,5,2015-06-08T17:10:28.000Z,CalP2000,I use this app every day!,"Needs a starter manual or maybe a ""show me"" video. Over the years I've tried a few of these apps. I keep coming back to this one because it seems to be the best for me."

901,901,4,2011-08-22T18:20:01.000Z,DepthOverSpeed,Made a difference,"Changed my habits and improved my health. The ease of use made me more likely to test and record, and to change my food choices based on readings. I've lost 30 lbs and dropped from an 8.9 A1c to a 6.2 in 3.5 mos by cutting carbs and closely watching the meter as I improved.  Great tool."

903,903,4,2012-03-16T20:31:46.000Z,Minnie208,Great bg app,"I like everything about this app except that the graphs are not very helpful to me. Having said that, I have not been able to find an app with superior graphs, so I can't complain too much. Glucose Buddy allows you to download your data, so I just dump it into Excel and graph there."
904,904,4,2012-10-26T02:29:52.000Z,Dave Siccardi,Better than paper,When I first loaded the app I was still keeping a paper log. It only took a week to say goodbye to the old log book. I really like the program and look forward to even more integration to my health program.
905,905,5,2012-10-31T03:35:18.000Z,KwaiLau,Helpful!,This is a great app for monitoring my blood sugar levels.  Having a web site to store and display the information is a good way to track my history.  Easy to use and well laid out.
906,906,5,2012-12-01T13:01:10.000Z,Shellster61,Neat tool,I am using the freebie version and it works like it should and for what I need. I needed to keep track of my readings/meds/insulin and regular paper and pen wasnt working for me. This is a handy tool for people on the go.  I would recommend it.
907,907,4,2013-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,TechnicalKat,Good ap for pets,I use it to track and send my cat's levels to the vet to monitor dosage. The meal information helps (while not accurate because of snacking) the vet. Would like it to run on iPad. And hope to have an integrated testing device directly feed to ap one day.
908,908,5,2013-07-30T19:07:44.000Z,Mitten queen,Great app!,I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and am tracking my glucose four times a day. I have been using this app daily and I love it. I also love that I can email my log to myself and print for my doctors appointment!

The companion app Calorie Tracker detracts from this app. GB would have been better served by expanding the notes section to track carbs, calories and exercise rather that push a second app where the foods in it's database are uncommon.

There are companion apps for tracking food, weight, etc., but the integration is poor and they are not as stable.  I recommend this app; but don't bother with the add-ons at this time."
912,912,3,2012-03-19T03:45:13.000Z,JsLoveBug97,"Love the app, however",The calories burned for activities is WAY off!!! 3 hours of road biking burns waaaay more calories then the around 80 or 100 the app states. In 3 hours I ride about 35 miles on a road bike...peddling. I know I'm burning more then the app says. Other activities are way off too. But as a log just for glucose tracking...I love it. It's super easy.
913,913,5,2012-06-26T03:53:48.000Z,Unus3d123456155,I'd be screwed without this,As a newly diagnosed diabetic this app has been invaluable. Only thing that bothers me is that the notes don't read clearly when you write more than a few words.
914,914,5,2012-10-04T18:46:13.000Z,ManlyTech,Glucose Buddy,My buddy on the go   Morning Noon and Nite    Just can't live without my glucose buddy     Has been a very good  and great help for me in managing my blood sugar   I have been using this app for some time and it is a lot of help and keeps me on track   Thank you  Buddy mu Buddy
915,915,5,2012-12-17T03:31:45.000Z,J (15),Amazing!!,Made my life so much easier I actually want to take my blood sugar more often just to see my improvements and result logged can't wait to buy the premium version
916,916,4,2013-11-27T01:00:21.000Z,sam goody,Great app with two minor qualms,"Really reliable, and syncs easily between iPhone and iPad. But I wish it took up the whole screen length of the newer iPhones, and you can rearrange the icons within the app, but they revert to the original settings upon restarting the app."
917,917,3,2014-09-26T20:17:31.000Z,missing options,Lacks better export options,App seems great but lacks better exporting options. Would be nice to see graph option as export. You see the graph in app but not as export option? Capture option renders horrible quality and it's only a snap shot of the screen (view). This is paid app version.
918,918,5,2015-01-14T13:20:09.000Z,007diabetic,Great app keeps you motivated.,"I really like this app and it keeps me motivated to be on top of my numbers. I'm sure like anything it could be it improved but it's the best one so far that I've come across, thank you."
919,919,3,2015-04-02T13:30:49.000Z,Popeye64,Larry45,"Have been using this app for about 3 years and find it very useful. Only problem is that I can't interface with my IPhone 6 Health Kit. I have other apps which automatically sync (i.e workouts, Walking Distance & Steps) with Helath Kit, but can't correlate exercise with Blood Glucose levels. Need to be able to synch with Health Kit!"
920,920,5,2009-11-17T02:15:52.000Z,Mayuyo,"DIABETIC, Add YEARS to your LIFE!!!!","A user for the past month and a half. I Love it. I now check levels at least once a day and its graph feature ""is worth a thousand words"". I also register my insulin intake and exercise. Worth every penny and more."
921,921,5,2011-05-24T20:57:36.000Z,747Marine,Great App,I use this app almost everyday. Very useful and helpful. My favorite feature is where it gives me the average numbers for all my readings which I can convert into a A1C number. I recommend this app to everyone.
922,922,5,2011-06-26T14:19:02.000Z,JnetnJoey,Great for focus,Logging the data is easy. My iphone's timer makes it easy not to miss a reading. Love being able to see a graph. But I am having problems changing the factor to graph (BP or weight instead of BG)
923,923,4,2012-03-26T02:14:25.000Z,Glucosechecker,Good App,Thus is a good app to keep track of glucose levels. It seems to have trouble linking up with glucose buddy website. I would give it 5 stars if it would print directly from the app instead of logging onto website and downloading Csv and printing that.
924,924,5,2012-07-16T20:18:21.000Z,Bets11,Review,I really enjoy the handiness of having my results where I can look at them whenever I need to. The only thing I would like to be able to record my own time
925,925,5,2012-11-10T15:01:27.000Z,Valeria Mathis,Great App!,My daughter found this app for me because I just couldn't remember to update my journal because I would never have it with me. Makes it much easier for my endocrinologist to see how I'm doing.
926,926,5,2013-01-10T19:05:30.000Z,Sunnrain77,Awesome helper,"Trying to track my gluclose has always been hard, but having something on hand is awesome. I love the notes option so I can keep track of what is going on."
927,927,5,2013-09-16T14:21:02.000Z,Gigi1274,Bs log *****,Great app! By being able to monitor my bs closely with just a glance was able to get be out of 400+ levels down to 100' s! Because I was so high confusion was bad so I entered them rt away and at dr ofc just showed all at a glance! Thank you!
928,928,4,2014-09-27T14:39:11.000Z,Erlic The Mad,Good app most of the time.,This new version no longer works with my 1st generation ipod touch.  Since they have been increasing the server capability things with syncing have become much better. Now they need to get healthkit support installed and it would be awesome.
929,929,4,2016-10-22T13:16:26.000Z,Bijou Boo,Great App for Tracking Blood Glucose,"I use this app everyday and use it to review my levels with my physician. The only complaint is that it should be a better way to print graph results using the online version. Otherwise, I'm pleased with the app."
930,930,5,2012-10-04T12:26:46.000Z,Norm Bailey,Glucose Buddy,Was using a former app that I'd used on my PalmPilot for years. Found GB and jumped onboard immediately. It has been super. And continues to get better all the time.  This latest update just makes it better than the best.
931,931,5,2012-10-05T18:10:42.000Z,artomcat,Good App:,"Glucose Buddy is a good app. It does help you to keep track your glucose readings in a electronic log book instead of having to use a paper one. It would be good if Glucose Buddy could interface with glucose monitors, like the Ultra One Touch from Lifescan."
932,932,5,2012-10-07T01:42:40.000Z,Shari53163,Excellent helper!,"This app has been a wonderful way for me to keep track of my daily blood glucose and even estimate my A1c. Love the fact that I can track my exercise daily, as well. Highly recommend!!!"
933,933,5,2012-10-30T15:33:20.000Z,Dixey Doodle,Great app,I have used several apps to manage my blood sugar.  I like this one best.  It's simple to use. And record keeping is a strength.  I have recommended it to diabetic friends and family. My doc likes it too.
934,934,4,2012-11-13T16:26:50.000Z,jcdsmith,Need to print out report!,"I dearly love this app except for one thing.  I need to have the ability to print my logs out! Now that we must present our logs to the pharmacist before obtaining our test strips, I don't know what to do?  Please some help from the developers??!"
935,935,5,2013-01-04T05:28:59.000Z,Rascals mom,Love this app!,"This is a very useful, user friendly app. Keeps track of all meds and blood sugar readings for you and along with My Fitness Pal makes a terrific weight loss program. Highly recommend this app!"
936,936,4,2013-08-06T22:45:40.000Z,Zoraster,Makes things easy.,Helps me to keep track. Prints my glucose level for my doc and allows me to keep it as a journal. Only thing I would like added would be a list that allows easy input of type of insulin taken and units.
937,937,5,2014-12-09T10:12:19.000Z,Billy baby,Glucose reading,I depend on this glucose reading as I have a medical condition that requires me to check my blood pressure also my blood sugar levels and this is very helpful for me it has kept me on reason really strict diet thank you
938,938,5,2015-06-02T03:40:43.000Z,Gil 47,Gil,I've been using this app to track and monitor my glucose for several years and it's never failed yet! Easy to use and customize for different meds. Try it!
939,939,5,2016-02-20T12:24:59.000Z,Qcdougn,Glucose Buddy does my record keeping on the go,GB is a user friendly log that provides a handy log for my readings while on the go. GB also will sync the saved test results if needed & provides a graph and averages.
940,940,4,2009-01-14T18:51:16.000Z,wheresmygravy,Nice App! But could you add one thing?,"I like the Glucose Buddy app and it's features, however, I also monitor my BP as part of my Diabetes Care. Would it be too much to add BP data tracking to this app? Otherwise, I have to get both BP Buddy and Glucose Buddy and track them in two separate data bases. Thanks!"
941,941,5,2010-10-23T17:34:23.000Z,Edward Abramson,Glucose buddy,BEST glucose tracker. Does what it says and well. Never crashes. My doctor finds the graphs and online reports invaluable. All of the others either don't work or crash. Spent 8 bucks till I found this.
942,942,4,2011-08-19T22:12:51.000Z,d‚Äôs Emmie,Good App,"I like the ease of use and love being able to use it with the website! The one thing I didn't like was having to buy an addition for weight & blood pressure, then it didn't incorporate them into the BG log. That was definitely not worth the $3.99."
943,943,5,2012-02-02T03:53:24.000Z,Color calamity calm,I love Glucose Buddy!!,"I have struggled for many years to regularly test my blood sugar and record the logs. Since getting this app, I have improved 100% and am proud to have something to show my doctor. Use this app!! :)"
944,944,5,2012-10-06T14:38:49.000Z,Mommery,Glucose Buddy,This app has been extremely helpful in the management of my Type II diabetes. It gives me the opportunity to share my readings with my physician and me the comfort in knowing I am doing what's needed to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Thank you.
945,945,4,2012-11-20T15:57:42.000Z,K. R. Jones,Glucose buddy,Glucose buddy allows me to track my blood sugar and log it on a daily basis on my iPhone. The graph shows me how on or off my levels are and it allows me to share with my health practitioner with out having to command things to memory or log books.
946,946,5,2013-02-21T15:30:36.000Z,Jb122383,Love it!!,I love this app. I can log by blood sugar readings and my A1C. It is important to me to be able to have a place to log that and more so I can show my doctor and I know myself what I need to do. Love the note section too!!
947,947,5,2013-09-16T12:49:30.000Z,WMFD46,Satisfied,Using this app for the last couple of days and so far I am happy with the functionality of this app. Just wish the pro app wasn't so pricey. Other than that I'm satisfied.
948,948,5,2014-02-23T04:10:05.000Z,tdpowells,Exactly what I needed,I love everything about this app. Only thing I would tweak is adding the ability to send more than one week of blood sugar readings. But this is definitely a five-star app.
949,949,1,2017-09-19T14:47:44.000Z,sonnymom3,HORRIBLE UPDATE!,I've had Glucose Buddy for about a year and loved it until now. This latest update and change is completely useless. It does not allow to log glucose readings with a corresponding meal or fasting and I no longer see a graph. You ruined a great thing. What a shame after paying 6.99 for it months ago to now have to find another app altogether that does what I need it to and what my Doctor will appreciate.
950,950,4,2009-04-06T16:35:45.000Z,MattSTP,Decent App,"This app is decent. All I think that it could use is on the graph it should have average blood glucose levels graphed for certain times of day. Morning should be a color, afternoon should be a color, and evening. If this is added I would give this app 5 stars."
951,951,5,2010-03-04T01:57:00.000Z,High-heel shoe,Good,I use this ALL the time. Thus app helps a TON! thanks. P.S. There are plenty of other app out there that cost $30 more than this one...and they do absolutely NOTHING! Don't waste your money on $h¬°+¬• apps when you can get this one for nothing!!!!!

952,952,5,2011-04-14T11:10:29.000Z,Moondust 7,My Doctor was impressed with this app,My Doctor wants all his patients to keep a record like this app. He found the graphs especially helpful when we took our graphs printed out for him to see.
953,953,4,2011-05-05T14:54:51.000Z,Technomage Ken,Nice but a full iPad version would be great,"A useful app, but I'm not a fan of the hamster wheel input.  An iPad version would be great.  An app with a spreadsheet or table option for entering data from multiple days.  Sometimes I forget and must enter multiple entries from paper."
954,954,5,2011-05-16T21:39:14.000Z,FirstBornofEleven,Great help,This app has helped me get my diabetes under control. The chart is especially helpful. I can see how I'm doing! It actually reminds me to test! Something I wasn't doing regularly before I started using Glucose Buddy.
955,955,4,2012-02-27T08:43:25.000Z,SRHolsomback,GB Thoughts,"This is a helpful app and it works well. I do wish I could change the graph to see averages for specific times of day as well as daily averages. The link to the calorie app does work, but that is the calorie app and not GB. But having a working link would be helpful."
956,956,5,2012-10-04T16:37:33.000Z,Kailuakane,Does just what I want...and then some!,"I wanted an app that recorded my daily blood sugar numbers, converted that data into a graph form and had an open ""chat"" room where I could get and share information and experiences. Hello G/B. I love it!"
957,957,5,2012-10-05T12:49:04.000Z,Matt III,Excellent App!,"Glucose Buddy has helped me keep tighter control of my blood sugar. I've had no real problems with this app. Sometimes it doesn't sync my readings, but I attribute that to my wi-fi. Is there an iPad version in the future?"
958,958,5,2013-03-08T03:16:30.000Z,Wildwest1973,Glucose,This App makes life so much easier keeping track of my blood sugar! I'm able to email my Doctors my numbers right from my phone or computer. A must have for Diabetics
959,959,4,2017-05-13T06:01:53.000Z,Eliza god,Food log glitchy,Love the simplicity of the app. Love the ability to email log to my physician. I'm struggling with the food log. Seems glitch as I'm not able to select the food and the amount. The only option for portion is defaulted to gram.
960,960,5,2009-01-07T18:36:25.000Z,NinaRios,Excellent!!! Must have!!!,"This is the best log that I have found! I have tried several others, and this one keeps track of everything!"
961,961,5,2009-12-03T14:25:21.000Z,CigarTOP,Yay! Charts are back!!!,"The 3.1 update certainly addressed all of my issues. This program is FAST, has an elegant interface, and provides abilities that leave all the other BG apps in the dust. Thanks to MYLEstone Health for listening to user desires and acting promptly."
962,962,5,2012-04-21T13:43:56.000Z,Mike in MI,Well Designed and Convenient,"I have used it for a few weeks now, and have found it to be well thought out and convenient to use."
963,963,4,2012-11-09T12:19:48.000Z,Biznme,Great app,I have using Glucose Buddy for months. Found this app and love it. Makes it so easy to record as I have my phone w me always. It is fast and doesn't freeze up like the web page does. Even syncs to the web account. Love it!
964,964,5,2012-12-14T22:42:12.000Z,T-Bird1965,Perfect app for me,"Just what I needed.  Simple, easy to use, good functionality.  I've tried other apps for tracking but got rid of them all an only use this one now."
965,965,1,2012-12-31T15:00:51.000Z,Gyveidv,Can't create an account,"I spent hours uploading my handwritten notes to Glucose Buddy for the purpose of sending the information to my nurse. However, I cannot create an account via the Glucose Buddy website! I receive a message each time that indicates that there is an internal server problem.  I've reported this to their support website, and haven't heard back after 2 days.  Fail!"
966,966,5,2013-02-04T02:39:39.000Z,Mr Moundshroud,Super convenient,Easiest and most convenient way I've found of keeping track of BG levels. Graphing function gives you a nice visual of your patterns. Highly recommended.
967,967,3,2014-08-10T04:34:23.000Z,revtup,Good but...,"I like this app. it is simple to use and visually appealing. But, there is one glaring flaw and it is glaring. The sync with the website feature rarely works and has been a known problem for some time. If they fixed that problem I would give it a 4.5 instead."
968,968,4,2015-03-19T11:06:06.000Z,Bpbell75,Nice for sugar tracking,This app works great for sugar tracking but seems to have a lot of useless functions that make it appear cluttered
969,969,4,2015-12-04T21:38:26.000Z,Flyfishingwardster,"Great app, but a bit dated user interface",I love this app.  It is easy to use and has helped me keep track of my blood sugars and medicines.
970,970,5,2011-04-19T04:00:45.000Z,Radiantbrook,Radiantbrook,"This is simply the best app, I have it on my iPhone. No more writing in those log books that don't even give you enough room to write much of anything.  I know my doctor will love it!"
971,971,3,2011-05-15T22:06:52.000Z,Johnr529,Ok,"I would like to see morning levels have their own line on the graph along with all the different times of day. Also I would like to see a chart where the actual numbers are shown with days on one side and times of day (after breakfast, ect) on the other side."
972,972,5,2011-08-27T23:59:07.000Z,Believer55,Amazing app!,Easy to use with great features. I especially like being able to have a graph that shows my blood sugar level over several days!
973,973,5,2012-07-02T00:55:07.000Z,Radyjr,Simply Awesome,I've been always having problems keeping everything on track. This app is just a amazing app for diabetics to have with you at all times.
974,974,4,2012-08-12T05:00:59.000Z,Tomst3k,Easy to use,"Very good app for keeping track of blood glucose records, as well as weight and blood pressure. Does not sync well with the calorie counter app, though. I think that's more of a problem with that app than this one, however. All in all a good app."
975,975,5,2012-10-08T23:58:19.000Z,Wizard djr,Mind blowing,"Very simple to use, keep every data that you input. I went through several programs that made so many promises"
976,976,5,2012-10-24T01:52:56.000Z,pickypatty,Great App!,This is a great App. Helped me track my glucose level to help keep it level. My doctor lives it too. It gives her a full picture of my levels for long periods of time. Thank you!
977,977,5,2012-10-29T04:49:25.000Z,Caramiamy,Great App,"I was recently diagnosed with diabetes. This came as a complete shock. This app helped me track my glucose, a1c, food consumption, exercise. This app helped teach me the effects of different foods and exercise at different times of the day. Thanks for the great app."
978,978,5,2012-12-04T13:54:31.000Z,SailorH410,Used for 6 months love it,Best app for tracking all my vitals. Makes doctors visit more meaningful when they can review history not just current point data.
979,979,5,2013-07-09T02:52:08.000Z,Syidavis,Such a big help!,This has been so helpful and able to email the documents to my doctor is even better.
980,980,5,2009-12-07T15:55:52.000Z,DawgTVman,Thanks for bringing back the graphs!,Thanks for bringing back the graphs on the app. That's really HUGE. This is a wonderful app for the diabetic. It would be great if you could do the same type of graph on the website. This is really an awesome app!
981,981,4,2011-07-14T11:19:06.000Z,ebresie,Good App for Diabetics,I like the app a lot.
982,982,5,2011-08-12T17:29:46.000Z,Gigi625,Helpful,I always had trouble remembering to check my blood sugar until this. Now before my doctors visit I can just print it out for me. The calorie tracker is also useful!
983,983,1,2011-09-29T23:06:46.000Z,Giggsburns,Can't even input my info,"Not sure why it stops at 341 pounds, but helloooooo a lot of people with diabetes are very overweight. I realize I'm outside the norm of even just ""overweight"", but it's supposed to be a health app. Accommodate everyone please. Increase weight input spinner. Speaking of which, why is it a spinner? Why can't I just enter a number instead of scrolling past 11 pounds, 12 pounds ...... just to find out it doesn't go high enough anyway."
984,984,4,2011-12-15T16:08:25.000Z,Hawks13!,Great app,"This has been very helpful visualizing my blood sugars on a daily basis. Even though some glucose monitors can graph your blood glucose results, it is much easier to see with this app and the bigger screen on the phone. I would recommend this app."
985,985,4,2012-04-01T02:30:32.000Z,GrammyDM,So Helpful!,"Having the multi device sync is great, albeit an expensive add-on!  I can sync between my phone, iPad, and laptop so I can keep track of my glucose levels wherever I am. That makes me more compliant with both my blood sugar and meds."
986,986,3,2012-06-21T11:25:54.000Z,Fmo4t,Decent,"I like the ability to add unique notes to each segment. I would like the ability to edit existing logs with regards to food, insulin, activity etc. the only thing that is editable in the bg level. A bit frustrating. Also takes a long time to load the app."
987,987,2,2012-07-02T11:22:28.000Z,Rob_LI,"Good app, but not complete",The app doesn't integrate with Calorie Counter due to calorie counter crashing.  While this may seem like someone else problem - this stuff should get tested and hasn't been. Cutting corners usually start this way.
988,988,4,2012-10-04T17:02:18.000Z,ThomLanphear,Makes it easy to keep track,Does a great job of keeping track of readings and medications without going to the extreme. My doctor loves the reports. Just wish there was a way to have readings transfer automatically from meters
989,989,5,2012-10-04T21:50:22.000Z,JKIJR,Great app,Really helps me keep track of my blood sugar. A 100% better than my previous paper log book. Like the ability to capture my logs and send to my doctor.
990,990,4,2009-01-09T05:16:32.000Z,rt207,"Very nice, so far",I hadn't realized what I was missing with the app I was using until I downloaded this one today. I LOVE that I can personalize my menu of foods and that what I eat shows up on the screen. This was my biggest complaint with the other app I have.
991,991,5,2009-05-18T21:27:07.000Z,Bobs iTouch,Great App.,I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Glucose Buddy has helped me understand the importance of daily glucose monitoring and has assisted me in lowering my daily glucose average. I have tried other apps & Glucose Buddy is the best one I have used.

1002,1002,1,2010-07-06T15:59:06.000Z,O_KHM,Not worth the price...,"This is a case of getting what you pay for.  I downloaded and waited (then waited and waited and waited some more) for my activation email that would have allowed me to use the app.  It never came.  I sent a note to their help account and guess what?  No reply.  Given the buzz in some communities about not being able to sync to web servers, I'm thinking the developers have abandoned this app."

That's about it...,Good for keeping a log; synching does not work properly; not too user friendly - no help feature that I could find; plenty of sales pitch for related paid products; better than nothing but I'll still look further.
1016,1016,4,2012-08-10T04:28:09.000Z,debbyfurst,Very helpful,"This is a great app and it has definitely helped me to track trends in my blood sugars.  My only complaint is that every entry automatically puts you at ""out of bed"" and it's confusing if you forget to change it. A great free app nonetheless."
1017,1017,4,2012-10-05T02:53:08.000Z,Vatore13,Like it,It gives a somewhat easy format to forward to your drs. I would find it much more useful if there was a photo option to take a picture of your meal so that myself and my dr could check carb intake.
1018,1018,5,2012-10-09T02:11:45.000Z,Peacewomyn,Best app ever!,This is an awesome app for diabetics! I love how I can chart my blood sugars. I also like that I can show it to my doctor or just take a pic & email it to her! If I could give this app more then 5 stars I would!

1020,1020,4,2011-05-21T12:28:07.000Z,DeanGuy2,Works well,Operates without any crashes and allows me to enter the info I need to track. Gave 4 stars because the free version lacks useful features of the premium version. I use the note field to detail meals and activities.

1025,1025,5,2015-01-18T16:18:55.000Z,RenieT5,"Easy to use, Very helpful",I find this free app very easy to use. Also helpful as my doctor can just scan through the log results and review the graph.

1030,1030,1,2009-11-19T21:19:21.000Z,EvanG22,Version 3.0,"Version 2.1 was a GREAT app. Without the charting/graphing feature, this app is nothing more than a glorified notepad. PLEASE bring back the charting/graphing feature, and if necessary, I'd PAY for the app. The change from the scroll-wheels to the keypad entry is better, and the reminder alarms are a good feature, but not worth the sacrifice to me. The Testing In Pairs feature might be worthwhile to me over time, but I NEED the charting/graphing capability."

1040,1040,5,2012-08-23T11:48:12.000Z,Wparlier,Great!,This is a wonderful app. It really makes me pay more attention to my insulin and food intake. The graph also helps me have a better idea of what my A1C is going to be. Highly suggested for diabetics.

I've got it set up to go off an hour after breakfast, lunch and dinner to check my BGL but it doesn't do it. Very disappointing. But I do still like the app."
1088,1088,2,2015-04-27T06:33:45.000Z,Kadam961,Graphing is poor,"I can enter data easily, but the graph function is terrible. It doesn't accurately graph my data - for example, it marked my low as being somewhere near zero, when in reality it was 86. Nothing I've do changes that glitch. Without the functioning graph, I cannot easily see a trend in my sugar levels. Boo."

1092,1092,5,2012-10-20T06:31:48.000Z,BigSteve4212,Love it!,This app makes keeping track of my glucose a lot easier. When I go to the doctor all I do is open the app and hand him my phone.
1093,1093,5,2012-10-29T13:52:28.000Z,Lee Doo captain,Makes it easy,And even adds a challenge to tracking blood sugar levels. Can't live without it. Really!

1100,1100,4,2011-11-08T01:04:29.000Z,Trski,Good app but crashes often.,Love the app!  Very useful in so many ways. The biggest problem is the crashing of the app. I would estimate it crashes about 30% of the time. That is too much.

1113,1113,4,2011-05-23T02:41:34.000Z,BobD716,Very helpful,"By requiring me to manually input my readings it helps me to remember to take them. My only complaint is in the graphing, it only tracks daily highs, lows and averages. A single line graph showing readings over time would be a nice addition."

1119,1119,1,2017-04-03T12:13:27.000Z,3101sajb,Needs updating. Won't work on next IOS update,"Well planned, very useful and easy to use. However, it has been so long since it has been updated the app slows your machine down, doesn't integrate with other health apps and it won't be supported and won't work in the next IOS update. The developers need to get this updated  or watch it crash and burn."

1123,1123,4,2013-01-23T14:40:28.000Z,asjonesdpt,Easy to use,Reading the logs would be easier if you could group them by time of day. But love how easy it is to use and sync and print off the numbers.

1128,1128,4,2013-12-10T05:42:56.000Z,Boriquateachr,Review,It's been quite helpful in tracking my sugar levels. If your a visual type person the graphing function helps you see your levels for several test cycles.

First, the graphs for glucose are helpful, but the bp and weight graphs are useless. Second, the app closes out when I try to edit bp entries. Third, the server is often too busy. Really???"
1198,1198,3,2014-12-03T13:42:54.000Z,Eai23,Not bad but...,I'm testing this app out to see how you compare to log frog. You need to allow two places after the decimal for logging insulin. Pump users can take hundredths of a unit but your system only allows tenths to be put in. Frustrating.

Now I have to manually upload them so my doctors office can see my results to make changes to my pump. Don't waste your money on the pro version cause it's crap. Time to find a new app!

When I log in food it should ping me 2 hours later so I can check my BG. If that feature is here... I can't find it. Will be continuing my hunt for the perfect app...
1316,1316,4,2012-10-04T14:39:36.000Z,Rvsteve63,Glucose Buddy,Works great for what I need!  Record sugar and meds and have reports to give my doctor on a monthly basis. Syncs between iPhone and iPad. Sure beats keeping a log. Web site does not work well but app works great

1365,1365,4,2012-05-16T20:50:15.000Z,Choppy24,"Good app, but",Unable to add my Freestyle Lite meter even though it's listed. I especially like the graph feature. Tried to get the carb count info but couldn't get the info for some reason.
1366,1366,3,2012-09-25T00:01:12.000Z,l plus boys,Good start,This is a good basic app.  I would like to sort graph by time of day category.  It would also be nice to touch a point on the graph and drill down to the log for more detailed info.
1367,1367,5,2012-10-05T16:03:23.000Z,Art2000F,Better than most,I like the integration with other apps.  Able to zero in on key components of BG control easily.

I started doing everything as I was supposed to, logging my food, logging my activity, logging my meds... after about 6 months into it my life got a little more hectic and i kept forgetting my notepad. At the time I logged everything by pen & paper. Eventually I started forgetting my notebook, eating on the go, forgetting my meds, etc... Well 2 months ago my old Treo started dying a slow death. I started phone shopping and my husband & my sister were both iPhone 3G owners so they kept pushing the iPhone. I was so against the iPhone just because it was so mainstream and everyone around me had one. One day as I'm watching the 2 of them talking about apps & seeing the commercial saying they got an app for everything, I started to wonder... I already had an iTunes account so I went looking for a diabetes management app. Sure enough I found Glucose Buddy, and much higher rated than even paid apps!! I went out and bought an iPhone3GS that day and Glucose Buddy was the first app I installed =)"

2221,2221,5,2010-04-10T20:42:03.000Z,iGearey,Best available,I'm a type 2 diabetic with large gl fluctuations. I tried all the free/lite iPhone monitoring tools and have found this one to be the best for the one most important reason to me ease of use. It has a no help needed user interface. Entering the basics 3 to 5 times a day has to take minimal effort or I won't use it. You can easily email the log to your doctor. You can also take a snapshot of the gl graph which is a good companion to the log so your doctor can zoom in on food and activites or lack thereof on the dates in your log that had the most fluctuations or highest gl. Your log can be synchronized with the server so you get the sense it won't get lost if something happened to your phone. I don't have any experience with recovering after a lost phone but the sync always goes smoothly for me. It's certainly fast with a wifi connection which I have at home.

3311,3311,4,2021-03-25T23:35:35.000Z,daytripper2k,Very helpful app,I‚Äôm new to the whole diabetes game as I didn‚Äôt even know I was until a stroke 10/2020. Now I am scrambling to learn how to change everything to live with it.  This app has been wonderful for a place to track and compare BG readings and track A1C.  Would highly recommend this app for getting to know your diabetes through tracking readings and the tutorials.
3312,3312,1,2021-03-25T03:22:29.000Z,Syjecoha,Where is customer service??,Cannot find a way anywhere in the app to contact customer service. I want to know why I was charged $54 for a $39.99 annual subscription. That‚Äôs a $14 difference.
3313,3313,1,2021-03-05T10:10:38.000Z,B3llafroggy,Constantly trying to get you to upgrade,I started out using the free version and you could only get a graph of your glucose for that day. In order to see a week you had to upgrade to $29.99. No I just learned if you want to see a month worth of data you must once again you guessed it upgraded to $79.99. So now you are paying $109.98 for an app.
3314,3314,3,2021-01-02T23:33:46.000Z,RVS70,Suggestions,I really like the app but a few suggestions. Count the total carbs of the different food items added. And fix the bug that now generates a separate item when scanning a bar code instead of including it in the meal entry I am making.

3317,3317,1,2020-10-15T22:35:24.000Z,Sonrisa G.,Great App but Sketchy Subscription/Customer Service,"I got glucose buddy back in February around when I got diagnosed. The free features were great and eventually I decided to try a free week of their $29.99 subscription as I wanted to do better. The counselor I worked with (Liz) was great and very informative and the lessons I got to read the first week were helpful, at the end I agree to start the subscription and stupidly gave my card info (important), I did not pay through the Apple store. Once I was signed up I still had my counselor, but all of the added features were gone. Honestly I didn‚Äôt really think of it right away, but eventually I mentioned it to my counselor and it supposedly got fixed, I wasn‚Äôt sure what all the added features were so I can‚Äôt say everything was correct. Thanks to Covid and my work hours being cut I had to drop all extra bills. I contacted my counselor as I couldn‚Äôt find any customer support, contact info, or how to cancel a monthly subscription. She gave me the companies customer support e-mail and I contacted them. I was told they couldn‚Äôt do anything. It was a subscription through Apple, but it wasn‚Äôt....there is no record of it through Apple (except for the fact I downloaded the app through the App Store), and my bank was always charged directly by the Azumio company. Any subscription I have gotten through Apple were always billed to Apple, not the individual companies. Customer service kept saying only Apple could fix it..... but Apple can‚Äôt as it wasn‚Äôt through them!!!! In the end I had to go to my bank. Which is a shame as had they not pulled all this bs I would have re-subscribed when I could. The App features are good if you choose to get this app, but use with caution!"

It has an exceptional system for documenting meals, meds taken, and blood glucose levels. I am NOT tech savvy and I have been able to easily navigate this app. Within 3 days of using it I upgraded- it was worth every cent. There is even an A1C ‚Äúpredictor‚Äù as to what u might expect on your bloodwork.... I will have to come back in 2 months to let you know how close it was! Easy bar code scanning feature to document foods. Easy to document what you eat. A true life & time saver for me."

I also find it irksome that it reverts back to ""Out of Bed"" catagory after a input, especialy when one is going to use the same catagory for a second entry.  Still its worth the mony not paid."
3332,3332,4,2011-02-05T21:50:57.000Z,TechnoJanitor,Well done,"Just started the journey of Type 1 with our 9 year old daughter. This has been a great app to log glucose, meds, activity, and Food intake. There is no built in food database, you add your own items. We just added a carbs entry to track total carbs. The in app graph for BG is helpful and entering logs is quick. The sync to the web is one of the strong suits. And the new 2 way sync, while a 19.99 add-on for a year, is keeping 3 iOS devices in our family in sync. One way sync is still free. Checking your data online yields more graphs and CSV export. Capturing the in app graph and emailing logs is also straightforward. My 9 year old has learned it quickly and enters logs on her iPod which sync with the premium feature to my and my wife's iPhones over the air. Developer responsive on forum and Facebook, you can tell this is a personal passion. Updates come regularly so I look forward to improvements. Free app with premium add-ons is a good model."
3333,3333,2,2011-02-06T06:12:37.000Z,JR5263,Multi-device sync is a good idea with a bad price,I've been a Type 1 for 24 years and was happy to find this app.  I was looking forward to the multi device capability being added to Glucose Buddy and was VERY disappointed with the $19.99 a year charge for the multi device sync. I wouldn't mind paying $5 to $10 for the ability to use the app on my iPhone and iPad but it's just not worth the nearly $20 a year. The app itself is pretty good. It would be nice to have better carb tracking abilities. I just use Lose It for that. I won't be adding the new upgrade to my iPhone.
3334,3334,2,2011-02-06T17:39:24.000Z,Bigbivie,Ability to enter earlier blood sugars,The app is ok but it is annoying that you cannot enter earlier tests. Some time I have forgotten to enter my blood sugar from earlier in the day and I can't enter so then I cannot send accurate info to my dr.
3335,3335,5,2011-03-07T16:56:39.000Z,Ty Agar,I've dramatically reduced my insulin requirements,"This has been important in tracking my progress with managing my diabetes.  Due to Tim Ferriss' ""The Four Hour Body"" and Glucose Buddy, I went from taking insulin needles 4 times a day to zero (0) needles!  This was in about 6 weeks!"
3336,3336,2,2017-11-22T13:13:29.000Z,The 49 Pang,"Works well, easy to use",I don't use a lot of the features.  It works well for keeping a journal of my blood sugar. I am hoping to be able to print out a three month report for the doctor.
3337,3337,1,2017-11-22T22:47:47.000Z,Stortz,No good since update,Since the upgrade for iOS 11 this app is not worth the effort to download even though it is free. The only feature that works in the app is the advertisement to upgrade. Based on my experience I would pay the $59.00 per year for the app.
3338,3338,1,2018-01-01T12:12:11.000Z,Unhappy @ KPN,Not impressed,Always something and says needs to have access to this or that. Wants to open Argus to be able to do motion detecting but when I do what it says there is no Argus to open....
3339,3339,1,2018-04-29T16:42:46.000Z,Jmhfla,Worst ever,What a rip-off. The time stamp for recording food intake does not work. I paid $33.00 for nothing. Oh I f your color blind it won‚Äôt work for you. Now comes the worst part. When you paid for the one year it then let‚Äôs you know that it will be recurring. I have never written a review like this before and if I can‚Äôt get better information before I purchase another app for diabetes then I won‚Äôt buy it.

I usually hand my phone to the doctor and let him scroll though the numbers and then I graph them for him.

3424,3424,2,2011-03-24T23:31:06.000Z,Songstermusicalia,Needs quick carb entry and basal log for pump,I like the add on of syncing with my iPad but HATE having to pay extra for no adds on an already expensive app. Entering carbs is way too labor intensive. Every new food has to be typed in. Also for it to really work for those on the pump it needs a way to keep track of basal rates.
3425,3425,4,2011-03-25T11:37:10.000Z,felderguy,Nice app,It is a good app but there are features I never use. I don't use the blog stuff or the feature to record sugar before and after activities. I do use the graphing but only on the website where it's a lot more user friendly.

I tried another app before finding this one, and it didn't compare with how easy this is to use. The only thing I wish it had is an A1C calculation.

I really find this app a great way to keep my records up to date!"

The performance has suffered a little in the latest version (3.6) but it is a useful and handy app that is easy to use. My doctor wanted the name.

The fact that you can set up an account online is nice, but the features of the app are rather limited. The graph of glucose level is useful but the scale is way too wide (0-460 mg/dL??? Really???). And there isn't an option to change the time frame either... In summary, it's probably better to pay $3 for another app with more options or functions..."

The only change I'd ask for is to make it possible to organize the log with folders for each day. The big long list can be hard to sort through. But still this app is crazy awesome!!!
3544,3544,3,2011-02-09T02:44:53.000Z,Krum 08,Good,Good app for recording and viewing blood sugars. I would think it would be wonderful if you could have a sync with the pump and meter like the meters can with pumps. This would make it much easier to accurately record your sugars.
3545,3545,1,2011-03-04T02:06:52.000Z,Green Monstahs,Glucose Buddy is no Friend,"As a diabetic and iPhone user I had hoped this app would solve my problem of manually having to record blood glucose and insulin data.  Sad to report this product doesn't deliver as promised.  Had problem with logs being accurate.  Also customer service experience was the worse.  Explained problem twice and could get them to understand the issue.  Also, bought some add-on for $3.99, which I thought allowed me to access web-site and exchange data to iPhone and iPad....was told that feature is $14.99.  When asked what the $3.99 charge was for...the customer support guy, Tom, said he didn't know. I've deleted the app and I'm $3.99 wiser."
3546,3546,4,2011-03-07T16:05:55.000Z,Tangle Eye,Very helpful app,I use this app daily to track my glucose readings. I really like the graph. That gives a quick visual of how I'm doing. Without this I would do a poor job of tracking I'm sure. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is there's currently no ability to sync to another device for backup or to move your history to a new phone. Maybe that will be in an upcoming release.
3547,3547,4,2011-03-07T16:18:59.000Z,No Sugar for Me,Nice app,This works great. Having the data in the cloud is a big plus.

I would love to see and insulin calculator( CF + I:cho) included in here. I have to go back and forward in between glucose buddy and other application. Another great addition would be a database with food carb information.

But why has development stalled?  It needs to be updated for iOS 7 and for iPhone 5.  I‚Äôd also like to see more add-ons available for purchase so I can track the other things I have to track.  (temperature, FEV1, FVC, and FVE25-75; in case anybody at Asumio is listening)."

3557,3557,4,2015-06-15T02:40:40.000Z,BJCFDL,"Good app, but lacks food support","Newly diagnosed Type 2, have been using the free version of the app for a week. I like the ease of logging blood glucose. I also like the method of the account data with the sync to the web app, which makes the data available on the computer instantly, instead of sitting on the Apple device until the Excel data is exported like other apps I tried.  It can be used for several types of logs, which is nice. Unfortunately, logging food isn't as friendly as I'd like. Missing bar code scanning and other features that could make it more useful."
3558,3558,5,2015-10-01T15:13:55.000Z,W9ams,App user,Works great and easy to log . I like that it syncs to a web site . I send this right to my doctor. I have only used the blood sugar part of this app.
3559,3559,1,2017-04-04T12:17:45.000Z,binfocus,Update,"This app needs to be updated for compatibility. I continue getting pop ups from apple saying so. It's slowing things down on my iPhone. I hope the developer will pay attention, as they never have before. They take your money then leave you hanging."

I need to print charts for my Doctor, but can sync from my Iphone to the Web site.  Continues to say my password or username is not correct.  Emailed support three times no answer.  If any one is out there would appreciate some help. With out the ability to syn and print  from their online site the App is useless for me. The error may be mine but if support would contact me it might be possible to clear it up."

The only reason not to give it 5 stars is that too often the syncing fails because the server is down. But you lose no readings as the next time you try, it uploads two."

3568,3568,4,2013-08-03T18:49:01.000Z,Spiritwind10,"Good App, expensive add-ons",This is the best app I've found for monitoring my glucose.  It's just a shame they really rip you to add a simple blood pressure measurement ($3.99) and the cost for basic multi-device sync at @12.99 is absolute piracy!
3569,3569,4,2013-10-01T12:45:17.000Z,narcher007,"Great App, not updated in long time",Best glucose tracking app out there. Docked one star because it hasn't been updated for iphone 5/5s or iOS 7.
3570,3570,5,2011-04-25T04:20:34.000Z,Cowboy0937,Majorsticks0937,This is a very useful app.  Makes my life easier.  Keeping my MD informed of my blood sugars is a major benefit.

3572,3572,4,2011-05-28T20:23:19.000Z,KoKo-MoJo,Seems pretty good so far,"I read reviews of many diabetic logging apps and felt this was one of the best two or three. Downloaded and have been trying it out for a couple of days. After in-app purchase of the two-way sync service ($12.99/year!!!) I experienced some challenges getting it to sync in both directions but finally found the button to ""Sync All Logs"" in the Settings panel."
3573,3573,5,2011-06-18T12:45:08.000Z,Fludrby,Glucose buddy is a real Buddy,"Well with me it is so awsome! I have my phone at hand all the time, I don't always have a pin or my log book. I really love the buddy for logs and I can send it to my Doctor too . This is a really big help because I get really absent minded and It helps me keep organIzed ! Thanks so much. One thing I would add is, the ability to save notes without a glucose test . It's not possible at this time. Sometimes I get caught working away from my meter and am unable to test at that moment and would like to note it. But other than that I love this app. If not for the app, I'm really a bad log keeper."
3574,3574,1,2011-07-10T20:59:21.000Z,Tom McElvy,The Add-Ons offered areSomewhat deceptive...,"I have had this app for awhile, but I used another (now gone from the store) because I liked their interface better.  I had to go to Glucose Buddy; and I saw that it offered syncing to their website with an add-on for $399.  Well, the add-on they offer does NOT sync back and forth, ONLY TO THEIR WEBSITE.  They want $12.99 per year for an add-on they describe as designed for syncing between several devices; which I was not doing."

The glucose buddy has helped me tremendously. I was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. And glucose buddy has made it pretty simple to record everything. Food, blood sugar, I even put my blood pressure in the notes. I always have my glucometer with me, as well as my iPhone, so it's pretty easy for me to keep track. The emailing of charts is simple. I can send it to my wife, doctors, parents, anyone really. This program has made this transition easy for me. Thank you."
3576,3576,5,2011-11-07T03:53:39.000Z,tadnjj,Where's the graph/chart????,"This application is the best one I have ever used to track my diabetes. I used to have a pocket pc and the expensive program ""Sinovio"" diabetes application. This one beats it hands down. HOWEVER, v2.1 was better because of the graph. Now, if you could put the graphics/chart back into v3.0, you'd have the best on the market, even if cost $50.00, and that's no bull!! Please put it back in."
3577,3577,3,2012-01-21T21:05:34.000Z,underdog2,"A terrific idea, but a bit clunky","I like the idea of being able to send my data to my doctor, but when I tried to set up the necessary Glucose Buddy account, I discovered that my username already had been taken. This almost certainly means I had created an account months ago and forgotten about it. But there is no ""forgot password?"" button, so I am left with probably two accounts, one a phantom and the other the one I now intend to use. This is my fault of course, but I'll bet it is a common occurrence, particularly for folks in the sixties (like me) who are the most likely customers of this product. I have used the second account, for the reason that I am unlikely to remember a distinctive user name that departs from the one I am accustomed to using. So for now, the application is of little use to me. These folks should follow the lead of nearly every other account-based system, and create a mechanism for absent minded customers to recover (and change) their password."

A way to e-mail the log, or just a certain set of days, to my MD would be great. Will you please add this function?"

The email function is useful in that I can send it to my doctor when needed and forward a copy to my online medical alert database so it is available in an emergency.

I tried Glucose Buddy, and thought it to be adequate for what I need, so I bought it $3.99.  After I bought it, I find out that you have to pay even more if you want the advertisements removed $3.99, and if you want a two way communication with your online backup it‚Äôs another $12.99 per year.  They call these extra add-ons, which all other apps come with as part of the full version."
