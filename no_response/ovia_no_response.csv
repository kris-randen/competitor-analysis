0,0,5,2019-03-13T21:45:56.000Z,shelbystackpole,Easy but basic,"By far the best pregnancy app out there! The kick counter and contraction timers are GREAT. I adore the growing hand and foot images as well, so precious and it just helps the whole experience of pregnancy feel more real. I also really appreciate the anonymous community feature as well! On my of biggest frustrations with other apps is questions being ignored/unseen because I wasn’t a “top member.”"
1,1,3,2021-08-12T12:59:12.000Z,SJO14,Good but could be better,"This app definitely has a ton of useful features and is great for tracking a LOT of things. However, I really wish it would let you put in your own medications to track and also not just suggest 3 medications you regularly input. For instance, I take probiotics daily and there isn’t even an option for that (which is a common supplement), plus I take other supplements not listed. Let me input my own to record please. I also take more than 3 things every day but it only shows me 3 options and then I have to manually search for everything else every single day. Meanwhile it suggests like 6 of the top medicines people take all the time, but I don’t take any of those so they just take up space where I would rather see MY top 6."
2,2,3,2019-04-02T17:20:17.000Z,fwegan,Flexibly useful,"I’m nearly 18 weeks pregnant and have been using Ovia every day for months. When I first found out I was pregnant I installed five different pregnancy apps. Ovia quickly became my favorite because the health tracking is so flexible and intuitive. I’ve been tracking my sleep, weight, and symptoms, and ignore the parts I’m not interested in tracking (e.g. mood, nutrition, exercise). I also like that there’s a nice-length article each week and some daily content that isn’t too overwhelming."
3,3,4,2018-04-14T21:19:46.000Z,StarryViolet,Mostly great,"When I found out I was pregnant, I downloaded several pregnancy apps to see which one I liked best, and Ovia won out easily. I like the interface and the customization. I love the daily and weekly updates and little blurbs about what to expect from my body and what was happening with Baby and it’s development. The ability to track food, weight, symptoms, doctor’s appointments, just about everything is great! The way that articles and videos are broken down makes them easy to search and find what I want to read. And the medication and food safety look up has been amazing and saved me a lot of unnecessary phone calls to my midwife. This only reason this rating lost a star is because I felt like the high level of daily interaction became all but non-existent once I went over my due date. I’d get one targeted advertisement and maybe one blurb about “is the nursery ready?” or “only a few days left”. I missed the timely articles, and wish that instead of recycled blurbs there had been articles about induction or how common it is to go overdue. I know those sorts of things exist because I could look them up in the app, but I wish they had been automatically showing up on my feed as a means of reassurance. Overall a great app, but updating it a bit would be even better."
4,4,3,2020-03-25T02:58:10.000Z,Breez5015679832,Community feature needs to be improved,"I love this app, it’s great I can see what’s going on in my body, if my symptoms are normal, babies development and it keeps my super informed. I do have 1 problem with this app, the community where we can ask questions. Your inbox fills you up with a bunch of questions to answer from other moms and sometimes the app. The problem is there’s no organization. As a first time mom whose due in December I see questions from moms later in their pregnancy and I’m wanting to view their answers to questions so I know what to expect but I can’t view the questions answers unless I answer her question, how is that helping moms? I’m having to answer a question that I don’t know anything about. It should be like a mini social media platform. Where there’s a feed and I can make it to where I can see question from people the same weeks as me, or their be different categories not random question popping up. The inbox should be used for notifications when somebody replies to your comment or somebody else replies on the post. Also the questions from the app should be in its own section of the app where we can click on it and answer it and it only questions that are relevant to how many weeks we are. Right now it’s asking me questions that aren’t even relevant."
5,5,5,2020-03-11T16:07:36.000Z,Gdkz2006,Favorite pregnancy app,I highly recommend this app.
6,6,3,2018-10-06T00:34:42.000Z,Upmove,"Like it, but needs improvements on articles","This is one of my favorite pregnancy apps for tracking the baby’s progress. I like how you can also put in doctors appointments, track weight, BP, etc. The daily reminders for prenatal vitamins helps if you’re the sort of person who might forget."
7,7,3,2017-12-11T06:58:07.000Z,RhiKonshuk,Love it but....,"I have really enjoyed this app a lot! I love seeing different things that my baby is the size of each week. The last 2-3 months though have been very frustrating!! Every single time I first try to open the app, the loading page appears for a good 30-40 seconds and then the app just closes itself. Usually trying a second time works just fine, but now there have been a couple days over the past week where the app will just keep closing itself no matter how many times i try! First of all the loading page lasts way too long... second of all why should i have this app taking up space on my phone if it is just going to choose not to work whenever it feels like it! One of the couple days i had just mentioned, i was at the store and wanted to use the food safety lookup...in Heinz sight i should have just used safari because i knew even if it was working like usual (second try access success) that would still be a full minute or more of waiting for it to just load!!! Safari takes less than a quarter of that time! Please fix this problem as i still love everything else about this app!"
8,8,4,2018-08-09T10:03:33.000Z,Mung Bean's Mommy,This is THE app to use!,"I downloaded another popular app when I became  pregnant and quickly got burned out on it - it was all advertisements and fashion advice. I downloaded Ovia and WOW am I glad I was still in the 1st trimester when I found it. The interface is user friendly, the content is truly about my health and the health of my baby, not about what other people think or what I should be wearing. I love being encouraged to log my food and vitamins, and have truly been eating more intentional foods since starting it. It’s encouraging, informative, and my husband even got to subscribe to the daily emails! It helps him feel involved and he has been following the recommendations for nutrition by going to the grocery store for me without me even having to ask- the app is telling him what we need! Love this app! The only function I wish it had was an option for a more detailed food log, and the ability to list more specific high-risk categories that aren’t preloaded. I’m high risk with a connective tissue and joint hyper mobility disorder but there’s currently no option to record it as it’s uncommon."
9,9,2,2020-07-28T22:46:30.000Z,vonwestercool,Okay but misinformation and advertising agendas abound,"Way way waaaaay too many ads in general but especially so for the same, narrow topics like cord blood banking. It’s something many parents don’t and won’t do, and the proliferation of ads for it just makes me want to do it even less. It smacks of cheesy marketing scam. The information really dumbs down things and makes me feel like I’m in the wrong, non-scientific app geared to airheads. I don’t know many women I consider airheads, so I really don’t know who this is for. Also topics like “are sit-ups safe?” are sorely misinformed. Sure, yes of course they’re safe for the baby up to a point at which sure there’s a minor risk of reducing blood flow while on one’s back. But they’re extraordinarily damaging for the pelvic floor and directly cause diastasis recti in many women and people in general. And then of course there are absolutely random posts like “what is bipolar disorder?” — not a topic that is very relevant for most first trimester women. Like why are we even talking about it? That’s said, interface is cute enough and modern enough. I like the “my baby is this size” comparisons by week, and the app is generally inclusive of various types of relationships, genders etc."
10,10,4,2017-10-13T16:53:30.000Z,S_Schultz,Great App but Update Left Something to be Desired,"I have really enjoyed using this app for my first pregnancy! I like the week by week articles, the fun themes, and the tools like the symptom checker and food/medication safety. However, there are a couple things I would improve. Since the last app update, it's harder to look up and find medications to record. In the previous version, it would keep your recently used meds (like prenatal vitamins) up at the top so you could easily find them. Now I have to search prenatal vitamins every time which is frustrating. Also, the kick counter was moved off the front data screen and moved into the more tab, which doesn't seem to fit for me. That is something I use everyday and data that I would like to be able to chart out (it's a higher priority for me than the activity tracker). Overall, the app is great and I do recommend it to my friends. Just a couple things that I would change to improve ease of use."
11,11,5,2017-12-14T15:46:30.000Z,GBunny06,Love Ovia!,"I love the Ovia apps; I started off with Ovia fertility, and, well, a month later I was pregnant! So I switched to Ovia pregnancy and love this one as well!"
12,12,5,2018-07-09T10:42:12.000Z,ADC022192,So in love with this app,"Since I have been pregnant with my little one this app has helped me out a lot. It is so informative that I feel like with each week as my baby grows I learn something each and everyday about my little one and it’s development. As a new mom to be I feel like this app gives me a piece of mind about everything as far as development of baby, the symptoms that I might experience that I might experience throughout each stage, sending me reminders for my doctor’s appointments. The articles they have for diet, exercise, recipes, and other useful things on the app. This is the only pregnancy app I’ve ever had and I must say I’m glad that I did it right the first time, this app is amazing. I recommend this app to everyone that’s pregnant, you will not be disappointed and you will be well educated just like I am now!!! This app definitely has me looking forward to meeting my little one."
13,13,5,2018-08-29T15:44:31.000Z,RaidonsProudMama,So informational while keeping it fun and visual,"From the moment I found out I was pregnant up until this very moment with my son curled on my chest, I have found myself oh-so many times reading the updated and offered articles. The information readily available is pretty accurate down to the examples given and solution offerings. It was nice to see week by week what to expect and how to handle and now as he grows there’s new facts provided that reassure a new mom he’s on track (actually ahead of) but to know there’s others experiencing the same if not similar and learning and growing with their child as well. Without either of my parents to confide in, I depended on this app with any question or possible concern throughout my now; 10 month journey. Thank you kindly for this wondrous resource. Pray others find it and are able to enjoy as much!!! Definitely a 5 star and highly recommended app. (Which I have referred every expecting parent in my life)"
14,14,5,2018-11-19T15:41:41.000Z,alymae88,Best Pregnancy app by FAR,"This app is amazing. I downloaded all of the free apps I could find involving pregnancy because I’m going to be a first time mom. Ovia does an amazing job of taking a little of every type of app (informational, social, health, etc.) and making it extremely easy to use."
15,15,3,2019-03-19T09:28:39.000Z,JanPonce,Great app,"Found this app via my employer. Really great app. It tracks food, weight, symptoms and many other things. App has many articles that are informative and educational. I love how I can track the babies weekly and gives you information about the baby on a day to day basis. Overall a great app. I would highly recommend."
16,16,4,2019-04-05T20:11:58.000Z,elvenarcher,Really enjoy this app but...,"This is a great pregnancy app to use and track things along your long 9 months. It has great features and is very easy and intuitive to use. I enjoy most of the articles that come across the feed. My favorite feature is tracking the baby’s size and growth, especially with the fun size comparisons."
17,17,3,2019-11-13T05:39:19.000Z,MumuErin,"So helpful, but so slow...","I’ve used multiple pregnancy apps for tracking my pregnancy and Ovia is my favorite! It’s the only one I use now. The information and tools it provides for you is so helpful, and I like the option it gives you to pick a theme for your baby’s size comparison (I chose animals, and my baby is a platypus this week - so cute!). The community of mothers on here also seems to be a bit kinder than what I’ve witnessed on other apps, more willing to be helpful and supportive and keep judgements to themselves. Even if someone expresses a difference of opinion from the current thread, they’re just nicer about it than other message boards I’ve seen. My ONLY issue with the app is that it’s difficult to actually get into. Each time I open it the loading screen is up for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sometimes it’ll close me out of the app before loading. Sometimes it’ll load my dashboard or the message board but it’ll be frozen so I can’t actually click on or scroll through anything. It’s a great informational tool, but it can be kinda buggy."
18,18,5,2020-10-12T21:55:52.000Z,FrozenYogurtGirl,Best Pregnancy App Available!,"Currently 13w pregnant, and let me tell you, this is the best app I’ve tried. Other apps have some cool features, but OviaPregnancy is all around great. Cool trackers, different themes, and good advice. There’s even a medicine and food safety lookup. And for day’s I forget to take my prenatal, Ovia reminds me in the app! Also, Ovia’s week by week sizing seems the most accurate to what a doctor might tell you. Other apps I’ve used are all over the place with their sizes. Sometimes a week ahead or behind common size comparisons. I can’t believe this app is free. AMAZING. Used the regular Ovia app before getting pregnant, and I’ll be using the Ovia Parenthood app for when baby is here. Not sure if that’s that exact name, but I’m sure it’s an amazing app too!"
19,19,3,2019-07-23T19:48:09.000Z,honest reviews r us,It’s a great app but ...,"Don’t get me wrong, this is one of my favorite pregnancy apps out there! I use it a lot to keep track of my baby’s growth, my upcoming doctor appointments, and so much more!!"
20,20,5,2017-11-15T06:04:17.000Z,Amy1616,"One of a kind app, provides real insight","This is my 3rd pregnancy and my 5th pregnancy app. Ovia is easily my favorite, and only 5 star review. It's exciting and fun to change up your settings whether it be background or the different ""size of my baby this week"" choices."
21,21,5,2018-06-02T10:19:44.000Z,BrigetteKnowsBest,"First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a baby...","I absolutely love this app! I use it everyday: when I first started to plan to conceive with my husband I was looking for an app that had more than just “cute pictures”. I wanted an informative app that would truly guide me. Once we conceived (5 ways and 5 days ^_^) it became obvious that this was the app to have! I have the daily community which is amazing! You can upload your questions and feel thy you’re not alone because you instantly have replies from women who are going or went through everything you’re experiencing. You also have tips as to why to eat, so to work out, cleaning supplies around the house. You also have the amazing daily tracker of everything! How you’re feeling, what you’re feeling, BP readings, weight tracker and so much more! Don’t waste your money and time on these other apps!"
22,22,3,2018-07-06T00:12:42.000Z,bgregory,Flawed But Decent App,"I wish there were more theme options because I don’t seem to know hardly any of the things it is relating to the size of my baby in any of the themes. I wish that under medications it would let you put in a medication even if the system doesn’t notice it because they don’t have some of mine listed. Lastly, for sleep and activity it would be nice to be able to add the information in later because if you sync a Fitbit and wake up in the middle of the night it doesn’t record all of your sleep just that first part and the step count is rarely ever consistent with what I’ve got on my Fitbit. If we could go back in and change the wrong information it would be such a better app. I actually deleted the Fitbit sync because the wrong information drives me crazy. Developers definitely need to put in work to fix the concerns of the users but other than that it is a nice app and I like the way it is set up."
23,23,5,2018-09-24T21:22:34.000Z,Lenaglt,What a fascinating guide and companion during this amazing trip of pregnancy,"Since I found out we were pregnant, I was finding myself all the time googling stuff on the internet to find answers, since all of these is SO new to me."
24,24,4,2019-01-27T16:03:40.000Z,Elisamai,Great for Normal Pregnancies!,"This is my second pregnancy and time using this app. Overall, it’s great! However, I wish the app would better customize when it asks you about certain conditions you might have (and you answer yes). I suffer from HG in my pregnancies and it’s s but disheartening to receive constant reminders about ‘morning sickness being normal’ or ‘should be over now’ or ‘even if you can’t eat, you should find ways to supplement anyway.’ If the app is smart enough to ask whether an expecting mom has HG, it would be nice to know that the app would use that information in its feeds."
25,25,5,2019-02-27T07:40:53.000Z,notatrumplover,Love It,"This is my first baby so I figured an app would help keep me sane. I went through 3 or 4 before I stumbled upon Ovia, and I didn’t have a single second thought when I started using this app. It’s easy, it’s sensible, you can control notifications, and you can put whatever information you have and you don’t have to worry if you don’t have the information it asks for because you can always skip it."
26,26,5,2021-04-06T07:14:13.000Z,Malintazo,Far and away the best pregnancy tracker!,"This is THE best pregnancy app! I think I have downloaded just about all of them, and this I’ve outshines them all. On the calendar view page you can track pregnancy symptoms, moods, activities, record milestones, add doctor’s appointments + reminders, and create notes. There is charting functionality that pulls from the data entered on the calendar for weight gain/blood pressure/sleep/activity and more. There is also a wealth of articles and resources. The data you enter on the calendar creates a personalized feed on the homepage, which also includes baby’s daily development information. If you love data and tracking your pregnancy in a simple and extremely user-friendly app, but also want a wide variety of functions, this is the right one! Especially given that it is free! Compared to so many apps, the free functionality is completely awesome. Five stars!!"
27,27,5,2021-03-16T16:57:08.000Z,kleinemBudget,"Easy, basic, and I loved it my whole pregnancy!","I’d been using the Ovia app for my period for years, so when I got pregnant I switched to the pregnancy app. It was so simple to use, and I loved the familiarity of the app having come from using their fertility app. The simplicity I think is what I really liked, simple but certainly enough! I loved the little images to show how big baby is compared to your hand or a seed per say. The little feet, it was a nice touch. I didn’t use the kick counter tbh because once I could feel my daughter kick, she basically never stopped moving. She was kicking so much it just didn’t make sense to try and record it all 😅. But anyways if you need the kick counter it works super great, and there’s all sorts of supportive and informational articles through the app that I appreciated. It helped me get my breast pump as well which was fantastic. Highly recommend!"
28,28,5,2020-01-24T13:45:10.000Z,JD13189,Love love love 💕,"I have used this app for drs appointments and just tracking my pregnancy up until the day i gave birth to my sweet little boy!! I absolutely love that i was able to put my drs appts into the calendar and take notes in it. I would write my questions and concerns in the notes section and ask them at my next drs appt, it was just very helpful. I also love all the little facts they put in the timeline for how my son was developing in the womb and all the articles on pregnancy. I still use the pregnancy app for the articles and facts on the timeline for how he’s developing now in the world, i just wish they had the timeline with these facts and articles on the parenting app too. The parenting app is good too. I hope it gets updated though, so i can put his drs appt in the calendar and take notes to ask his drs, and then i can do the same for my son."
29,29,5,2019-11-06T19:07:29.000Z,Andddeewww,Favorite Pregnancy Apps,"I tried a few different pregnancy apps and this is by far my favorite. You can see illustrations of your baby at different stages, check whether certain foods or medicines are safe during pregnancy, track your weight and symptoms,  post questions to a community forum of other Ovia users and so much more!  Every time I think, “I wish Ovia had this...” I find it seconds later, it’s so useful."
30,30,5,2018-01-07T14:44:40.000Z,Kellystan,Best pregnancy app ever!,This app gives you daily updates as well as weekly updates about your baby and about your body. It tells you what to expect and It’s so accurate.  You see weekly illustrations of what the baby’s growing body looks like and also it has little growth charts of hands & feet as well. I check the app everyday because I love seeing the daily updates of how the baby is evolving. It’s really neat and informative. You can check updates from the weeks ahead which is nice because I like to be prepared and you can track everything. I put all my appointments in the calendar for this app. The calendar is also convenient because you can skip ahead to certain dates and it will tell you how far along you will be at that time. Love this app and can’t recommend it enough!
31,31,4,2018-03-04T04:05:15.000Z,ktimms,Overall great - a few small notes,"Love this app! It is user friendly gives me plenty of info but isn’t overwhelming! I love that I can log all my data in one central point but what would make this app better is to have that data more usable. For example, I log my weight and I can’t see a summary of my weight gain to date to see if I’m on track. There is a tending section but the graph only shows the last few says and you have to scroll to get more data. It would be more helpful to have all my weight entries in a complete log or to actually have the app calculate for me. Similarly if my goal is 4 workouts a week it would be helpful to see when I’ve met that goal or when I haven’t. The app has great information and I do like having one central place I input all my data but it’s bit frustrating that I can’t get all that data back out in a useful way."

34,34,5,2018-08-07T00:34:12.000Z,Rabbits & cats,"best pregnancy app, no click bait","i tried all of the major pregnancy apps, and ovia is the only one i am still subscribed to and have on my phone at 8.5 months. all of the other apps constantly bombarded me with ads and click bait about the “10 things you’re eating that are harming your baby” or “5 things you need to stop doing NOW to have a healthy baby”. the ads were one thing, but the articles about what to do and not do on the other apps are often unsupported by medical literature. Ovia doesn’t try to give me anxiety about eating anything, shame me for not doing certain things, and doesn’t present me with information that is unsupported by doctors and the medical literature. i highly recommend this app for any mom that gets anxiety from all the click bait on the other apps."
35,35,1,2018-08-10T11:24:15.000Z,gracie123456,Feels like a constant survey,"I’m sure the way they monetize is by sharing user data. They constantly are asking questions like “do you struggle with mental health?” “Have you ever had a miscarriage?” “How many children do you have?” Not just on the main page, but there is a whole page dedicated to survey questions! Yay! Exactly what my pregnant, tired, sad, self wants to do when I’m looking for a little support and place not to feel so crazy. Answer really personal questions that are shared with, who knows?:D"

37,37,5,2018-11-11T23:12:57.000Z,NatureLove3567,Most Informative,"Ovia doesn’t necessarily have all the excitement of articles everyday, BUT they have so many other helpful tools that other apps don’t. For example, their forum is the easiest to use. They also have a KICK COUNTER, CONTRACTION TIMER, MEDICATION SAFETY LOOKUP, FOOD SAFETY LOOKUP, and SYMPTOM LOOKUP. You’d have to download several apps usually to get those things and it saves you so many calls to your doctor about simple things like allergies and what’s safe to take. It really has way more than the other apps. It shows how baby is growing and comparative size. You can also choose what you want size compared to, cute little animals, veggies and fruits, pastries, or random. It has the weekly updates and information for multiples too! I really loved this app and many women don’t even know all the features it has. :) totally worth it"

I’ve literally been using Ovia for years and have never tried a different app because this one is just so great and has everything I need. While pregnant I can check it daily for updates on my baby, tips and healthy food options, and can track how I’m feeling, my weight, exercise and so much more. It really helps when your foggy pregnancy brain forgets things or when it’s been a few years since you had a baby and just need a refresher. I also really love the food safety look up! I use it constantly. This is seriously a woman’s best friend during pregnancy. Also check out their fertility app (used that with two of my pregnancies) and they’re parenting app! I couldn’t recommend Ovia more!"

Afterwards, I used the Ovia fertility app to track my periods and eventually become pregnant again... And now I'm using the Ovia pregnancy app during THIS pregnancy with my son. I can't say enough great things about all of the Ovia apps..."
40,40,3,2018-03-09T14:41:42.000Z,VadeMecum8,Some Good Stuff...,"This app is... okay. The layout is nice, and I LOVE the different themes for how big your baby is (“Parisian Bakery” and “Weird But Cute Animals” being my favorites.). The daily facts are fun and interesting, though a little repetitive."
41,41,5,2018-06-24T15:35:50.000Z,SaltAndPepperMe,"Useful, helpful, fun, & cute!!","I used the regular Ovia app not to track ovulation but only to track when I had my periods so I would know when it was coming, and understand when my moods would change during the cycle. When I marked I was pregnant (we weren’t really planning it but took a chance and it happens on the first try 😳), the app brought me to the ovia pregnancy app. I loaded it and found that it was even more fun and cute than the regular app. You can decide your background colors, post your picture, nickname your baby a fun name, even choose if you want the app to show you the size of your baby in bakery food references or fruit references, or some other reference. I like it. It give you info daily also about the growth and development of the baby."
42,42,3,2019-04-23T11:00:01.000Z,ALP_233,"Great app, but could be more inclusive","The app itself has been great as far as telling me about my baby’s size and development! It’s so fun to see what weird animal she’s sizing up to and about how big her little hands and feet are....But I wish there was a way to add what kind of birth I’m having. Despite months of planning and preparing for what I considered a “normal birth,” I’ll be having a scheduled c section. This has been a pretty emotional thing for me to work through, and it would’ve been great to be able to select this type of birth as an option in the app and receive articles and insights regarding c sections. Getting daily notifications and articles about managing pain during labor and knowing when to go to the hospital has made this whole experience feel more isolating. I know c sections have gotten far more common, so I would request that you factor them in to the app and its content."
43,43,5,2020-12-19T12:46:02.000Z,alexz0518,My favorite,"Like probably every new mom, I downloaded multiple apps when I found out I was expecting. Ovia was one of two that I actually kept. I love the daily facts and emails as well as the weekly updates with so much insightful information. The hand and foot growth pictures are just too cute along with the size of baby. Being able to track every symptom, doctor visit and special moment is super helpful (especially when you’re experiencing pregnancy brain). My only negative is that we decided not to know the sex so we didn’t choose one in the app however it referred to baby as she more often than he - it would help if it mixed it up in the same read or used “s/he”. Aside from that I love it and can’t wait to see what it offers post pregnancy"
44,44,2,2020-05-21T14:02:46.000Z,Fb bank,There are problems that should be easily fixed,"I got this app, along with a bunch of other apps, when I took the test and found out I was pregnant. I’m now nine weeks, and this app is one I use everyday. Now I like it for many reason, it’s cute, it’s easy to navigate and use, and it has the potential to be very useful when a few things get fixed."
45,45,3,2021-06-30T12:25:32.000Z,Oracleunik,It’s good but could be tons better,I like the concept and the follow week by week is really cool. It’s a weekly ritual to read them with my husband. Like the milestones and all the notes you can put in there.
46,46,4,2020-04-10T22:12:18.000Z,Melanie Heart,Great app,"The information we get is great and I love how they use our baby’s nickname to personalize the information ! That is one of my favorite parts! Also I love how they introduced me to babylist ! That is one of the best things that happened in this pregnancy. Some of the information becomes a little mundane, and  when you do put in some of the moods, and symptoms the app don’t do much with that information, it does not keep a chart or anything like that. That’s the only thing that i see a problem with unless I am not using that part of the app properly. I also love that they introduced me to different websites that help you get breast pumps and other pregnancy accessories that insurance pays for. For example like, pregnancy compression socks, or belly band, the owlet, and breast pumps that are not available on other sites. Thanks God for this app."
47,47,5,2020-06-15T04:18:59.000Z,Kolabo.life,Best Pregnancy App,Happy that I am a first time mother In the 20th century and get to be so well equipped  through my pregnancy with this awesome app. I was using the basic week update but now I’m 21 weeks and as I progress and have more planning to do I have just checked the app first to see if it provides what I’m looking for and it has 100% down to the Babylist registry. I’m happy I randomly found this on Apple store this would so much more work and stressful trying to find everything this app provides in different places. This is a one stop shop! Keep up the great work guys. I can’t think of  anything that needs fixing. I would suggest maybe adding a hiccup counter. I placed mine yesterday under kick counter but I noticed this won’t work for that.
48,48,1,2020-11-05T14:21:25.000Z,Goferper,Beware of adding a second pregnancy!,"I’m pregnant with my second and wanted to use the app to log this pregnancy like I did my first. The app has an option to “add another pregnancy” which I selected and added my new due date. I then tried to go back to my first pregnancy, since the app clearly said I was adding ANOTHER pregnancy and not replacing or changing the due date, but my first pregnancy had been deleted. I am extremely upset that all of my data is gone, I specifically wanted to use this app because I thought it would allow me to compare between pregnancies because I had complications with my first. I am devastated that all the information I so carefully logged while anxiously awaiting my first child is just gone, without ANY warning. At the very least, the app should very clearly warn users that their prior pregnancy will be deleted if they try to use it a second time, it is extremely misleading to call it “add another pregnancy” when it is in fact REPLACING the first."
49,49,4,2020-02-20T06:21:31.000Z,MO3Lenscap,"Overall, good and helpful with a few small faults",I have really enjoyed this app. It has been helpful and fun. My two children love seeing what animal their new sibling is similar to in size. It has helpful information.
50,50,5,2017-09-19T11:11:20.000Z,patirula,Best app I've tried so far,I used Ovia while TTC and I loved it and it truly helped me get pregnant. I was using many different apps including Glow and Ovia was the only one that let me adjust and personalize it to my cycles and changes. Other apps keep going back to 28 cycle days even though you change it. I have cycles of 50 days so I needed an app that let me personalize and understood and tell me what would happen in those 50 days. Now using the pregnancy app is so easy and fun and gives me a lot of helpful tips. It also helps me personalize it to set the weeks and time as my doctor calculates and not self calculate it based on 28 days. I love it and am so grateful to have the app! Can't wait to get up each morning to see what it new with my baby!!
51,51,5,2018-03-23T23:28:25.000Z,Dogodokov,Awesome companion,This app has been like a caring companion to me throughout my pregnancy. The style is kept light and friendly and is inviting. The interface is easy to use even though there are so many options. I love the ability to track daily stuff like emotions & symptoms in addition to food intake. I love seeing updates of baby’s size and a summary of what to expect each week.  The most impressive part has been the “health coach” that periodically sends a message about general pregnancy topics but then actually talks to me when I reply back and offers advice on any questions. It’s hard to believe this is a free app! So many wonderful features that have been a great help and comfort through my pregnancy. Thanks Ovia for this good service you offer!
52,52,5,2018-06-21T19:29:29.000Z,SpecialKay19,"Love it, but would love a new feature...","I LOVE this app and the resources it provides!!! The food/medicine safety lookup has been a lifesaver, and the explanations of what’s going on with me and baby every week are awesome. One minor thing I would love to see, though, is the app keeping all of the photos that I post to keep track of my/baby’s growth. I don’t want to be the person who posts a new photo of myself on social media EVERY week, but I would love to still have the photos consolidated and saved somewhere so I can look back on them! So it would be awesome if there could be a feature that saves your progress photos each week. I know, I know, it’s a super nit-picky thing, which is why I still am giving the app 5 stars 💛"
53,53,4,2018-07-21T03:28:22.000Z,JJ62480,"Love this app, not the users!","I love this app! It has many great features and is easy to access and use. I used the Ovia fertility app to get pregnant and I highly recommend that one as well. My only real issue is with the community posts. So many users post things that are completely unnecessary and unrelated to pregnancy. They like to vent about their personal problems and relationship drama. It’s a waste of our time! I’m currently expecting my third baby and I try to be helpful and encouraging to my fellow expectant mommies, but having to scroll through and read ridiculous posts about who knows what gets very annoying and therefore I removed a star. I wish this app could filter out the unnecessary posts and keep the topics pregnancy related only! Otherwise, great and useful app!"
54,54,4,2018-10-01T11:04:26.000Z,I like chiken: ),Very helpful,"I used both Ovia and Glow when trying to get pregnant, and updated when I got pregnant. I truly appreciate the fact that Ovia has the food warning list, the medicine safety, the way it counts down your dates and tracks your pregnancy, and my husband and I both have so much fun looking at what size our baby girl is not only in fruit/veg but the “fun and games” and “cute but weird animals” for comparison."
55,55,4,2018-12-29T06:34:46.000Z,Goldiegc,Good app needs more details.,"This app is simple to use, which I love. It would be nice to have more details on baby development and/or body changes. I do sense it focuses more on smooth pregnancies and less on those who may have some slight complications. I’ve had morning sickness and weird symptoms (nausea, sensitives to some foods, muscle spasms, etc) throughout my pregnancy. It would’ve been nice if some common symptoms could be mentioned for those who have them can relate better."
56,56,4,2019-03-27T16:59:45.000Z,Szeszesze,"Some great, some just ok.",I love this app for some features & prefer Pregnancy+ for others. So I use both.
57,57,1,2019-11-13T15:57:19.000Z,vaw7,Frustrating app,UPDATE: after the most recent app update I’m unable to even use this app.  Very disappointed that there’s been no news or a fix to this yet. I will give it a few more days and then I’m getting rid of it. No sense keeping an app that doesn’t work and taking up space. Wish I could use for the rest of my pregnancy.
58,58,5,2020-12-18T19:25:19.000Z,shastiny,Best out there,GettingPregnant young is very scary and you want to make sure you have all the information needed turn true that you have a healthy pregnancy and this app has by far been the best app I’ve downloaded for this purpose. I had a miscarriage back in September and got pregnant again at the end of OctoberAnd this app has been a lifesaver. Not only can I track my babies growth but it also gives me tips and information I need on staying healthy both physically but also mentally and emotionally and it also gives me tips and gives me suggestions on what I could experience each week ofPregnancy so I’m not left in the dark I definitely will continue to use this for future pregnancies I love this app!
59,59,2,2019-06-19T19:04:47.000Z,Reviewer7531,Doesn’t take into account diseases,"Hyperemesis is a condition that affects about 1-2% of pregnant women. Common, but rare. And every day the app shames HGers by asking us if we are taking our prenatal. Trust us, we’d love to take a prenatal and do pregnancy yoga and love the life, but taking a prenatal generally makes us vomit our stomach contents. Brushing our teeth, walking through a grocery store, daily life is already hard enough. We feel bad we can’t take the prenatal vitamin (which isn’t as necessary to baby health as NUTRITIONAL FOOD is, says the American Pregnancy Association.) But even knowing that we have HG, because the app asks, it still shames us every time we open it, we can’t use it without it being like the nagging parent going “you really need to take a prenatal.” I would, if I could, if it didn’t make me vomit everywhere. Thanks, Ovia, for shaming pregnant women when you’re aware already of their disability during pregnancy."
60,60,5,2017-10-01T08:25:41.000Z,Snolavarria,A fun resource!,"As soon as I found out I was pregnant I knew I wanted a cool app to keep track of everything. I found Ovia by just browsing through some of the top rated pregnancy apps and I absolutely love it. It’s such a fun and exciting way to keep track of your pregnancy with features such as a calendar to add doctor’s appointments, baby size/fruit comparisons each week, fun facts about baby’s development, and some incredible resources and articles. I’m nearing my due date and after using this app for the past 9 months I’d say I’m totally satisfied with what Ovia has to offer when it comes to following along with all the ups and downs of pregnancy and I’d recommend it to other women I know who are pregnant! It’s been a fun ride."
61,61,5,2017-10-08T13:56:14.000Z,Nikiwalker1016,Wish I would've found sooner! Best pregnancy app!,"I am currently 25 weeks pregnant, and I just found this app, as I had been using others up until now. As soon as I opened it, and used it a couple times, I deleted all my other pregnancy apps. This one is by far the best! The videos are the most personable and relatable, and all of the information is presented in a fun and customized way! I especially love how they use your baby's name in everything they tell you! This app has SO much that the others don't, and it's a lot more relevant and modernized!! You won't need a handful of apps, just this one! I only wish I had found it at the beginning, but I look forward to using it for the rest of my pregnancy!"
62,62,5,2018-01-12T16:48:44.000Z,Lblurves,Great App!!,"I love this app. This is my first (surprise) pregnancy, and since I never planned on this happening, my lack of pregnancy knowledge was substantial. This app has been so helpful with the day to day updates and also the ability to look ahead to see what may be in store."
63,63,3,2018-02-27T02:49:22.000Z,morae,Worked great a year ago but...,"So I used this app last year with my first child and I loved it. I downloaded three and this one was by far the most user friendly. It had everything I wanted right on my home page. I love tips and recipes and of course knowing where my baby is in development. However, I’m now pregnant with my second child and the app never works. It won’t open and it kicks me out often. I’m not sure what is going on. My phone is updated and has space so at this point I really think the app has a bug. I’ve stopped checking it because I won’t be able to access it for a week then all of a sudden it works and I’ve missed one of those weeks of development. I’m really disappointed with it at this point. Shame because it was one of the better pregnancy apps out there."
64,64,5,2018-07-17T16:22:38.000Z,Daejah&Tyler,Perfect!,"I used the regular ovia app for tracking my cycles & when I’m fertile. I struggled for years with a very harsh & unpredictable menstrual cycle. The app recommends so many different & helpful things to regulate your body or get to know it better. After about 6-7 months of using the regular Ovia app, I spent some alone time with my husband and found myself pregnant! These apps are amazing for every woman from every background. Happily tracking my baby’s growth, what to expect while my body changes & what to look out for as far as food & medications. It’s fun to involve my husband who is currently deployed! Makes things easier. Can’t thank the creators of this app enough for all of the help you’ve given us!"
65,65,4,2018-11-09T17:48:21.000Z,Jessicarnahan87,Love most things but,Love most things but its like all the other apps I've tried in one way. And that is that it assumes your having the baby in a hospital and have a doctor. I know home births are not super common but they are growing in popularity. This is my third baby and we decided to try using a midwife and having our baby at home. Id like to see more options for that and more articles. It’s probably a challenge because theres not a ton out there but having it incorporated would help me be more informed and that the information is also for me not just women with doctors and those giving birth in a hospital. I love the layout and options of this app though. Everything looks clean and well thought through. I really wish I tried this app much sooner!
66,66,5,2019-01-27T14:54:06.000Z,Angielalalalalalalaaa,Best pregnancy app!,"It’s the cutest, most informative, and most easy-to-use pregnancy app. I tried many others, and kept coming back to this one. I used it way more religiously for the first 10 weeks, then slowly faded off as I became more and more comfortable with my pregnancy (: Now I use it for tracking my food intake, appointments, and the daily and weekly updates of how my baby is. The forum and posting segment of the app is great! Sometimes you get ladies who think they know everything, and will call you ABnormal or wrong for feeling what you’re feeling, but you just have to weed them out and look for the kind and helpful people. When I have issues or screws, they are always quickly answered."
67,67,5,2019-09-16T15:17:13.000Z,alfkj,Greatest app for an expecting mother!,"I downloaded quite a few pregnancy tracker apps at first, to decide which one suited me best and Ovia is hands down the BEST!"
68,68,3,2020-02-09T03:30:38.000Z,lovesupremequeen13,Great but....,"I really love this app. I like having the calendar and the option to input symptoms and notes. I really looked for that and didn’t find it in many others. However, this app doesn’t compile your information or anything, you have to go back through the calendar and find what you put on the entry that day. For instance, when I click on “My baby names” under “more”, I though it’d be a compiled list of names I’ve put into the app, but it’s a totally different function that gives you a list of popular names. Though I enjoy it, just isn’t what I thought it’d be. It’d also be great if notes were in there that way so I could just give my doc a run down of pains & occurrences I’ve kept track of or something. The notes app on the phone still works though but it’d be helpful in a dedicated app."
69,69,5,2019-11-07T21:31:54.000Z,CVD1220,Great Way To Track Your Pregnancy Journey,"This app is easy to use and provides a lot of helpful information about each step of your pregnancy in a fun and understandable way. The ability to track data like your weight gain, your emotional and physical symptoms, as well as the special moments, such as the first time feeling baby kick, are so helpful, especially for a first pregnancy. I can not recommend this app enough — especially after having a minor issue as a result of a phone software update when I thought I had lost all of the last 8 months of data I had logged. The Ovuline Support Team jumped right in and helped me to get my account back up and running with nothing lost!"
70,70,2,2018-01-15T02:52:10.000Z,Ari_yo,read further !,"Honestly i really enjoyed this app when i first downloaded it.. it has good features! but it's a sad app to use when there's so many immature women using it too. This app is to help out other pregnant women with advice and things like that, there's a lot of shaming done here and jokes made about single mothers and first time moms that are unsure of certain things. I feel like this app should probably be monitored more closely.. since it's anonymous questions on the app people get so comfortable being rude and hurtful. Lots of bullying between the mothers and it's sad. I currently am going to retire this app and use ""The Bump"", or ""Baby center"" .. a better community .. would use this again when things are more monitored and people are punished for their rudeness. I really did like this app for a while though! just be aware ladies there's a lot of bullying here."
71,71,3,2018-02-06T14:20:22.000Z,LittleIssa,Too many insurance plugs,"I used this app for my last pregnancy(3 years ago) and loved it, so I was quick to download it again when we found out we were pregnant a second time. However, this time there seems to be less information about the pregnancy and fetal development, but significantly more plugs for connecting the app through your employer for insurance information. I understand how that could be helpful to some but not to all of us (we have Tricare for the military insurance and it won’t even recognize it). It seems like every-other article on my feed is a promo for how Ovia and your insurance can work together to improve your app experience, which ironically is taking away from mine. Not sure I’ll be using this as my primary app for this pregnancy, unfortunately."
72,72,4,2018-02-16T17:19:58.000Z,monica0238,Great but needs a change of a main feature,I really like this app but one this really has bothered me from the start. The references that are supposed to help you understand how big your baby is supposed to be are all strange. You can choose from weird and obscure vegetables that few people have heard of and give you no clue as to the size of your baby or you can choose from exotic/ rare animals that few people have heard of that also give you no clue about the size of your baby. The problem to me is am I receiving a lesson in obscure agriculture or zoology or am I trying to gain some concept as to the size of my human baby?  This strange feature has made me want to open the app less and just upset me every time.
73,73,5,2018-04-17T14:19:15.000Z,edufek,Love this app but needs bump pictures!,I really do love this app. I used the Ovia fertility app prior to this one so it was an easy transition. I downloaded 2 other popular pregnancy apps and this one is definitely my favorite. It’s well organized and filled with tons of good info. I especially love the easy food and medication safety look ups! If I have one complaint though it’s that there isn’t a good place to upload weekly bump pictures. You can upload pictures but they aren’t easy to find again and it’s not like the other apps where you can click on which week it is and upload a picture there to keep them organized. I.e “week one pic” “week two pic” etc.

I went a little to overboard and downloaded them ALL 😂 some will say but out of all the apps I do enjoy Ovia the most! I love the updates it gives me about my baby size, it’s really helpful when you use the health track and different sources in the app pops up and reminds of you of what the app has so you can cope -if you’re a mom whose been stressing and been a little more than sad lately."
75,75,5,2018-10-10T21:42:54.000Z,Cbearnelson,Third Pregnancy Best App Ever,"Every pregnancy I’m on the hunt for the right app to give me updates on my baby-mainly the veggie comparison and the weekly growth updates. At most, I would open the app once a week to check size but after the first trimester, it would lose its appeal. This app is so amazing that I check it everyday for its tiny one sentence updates on my baby’s growth. It asks me every morning if I took my prenatal the night before. It shows me baby size compared to baked goods, veggies, animals, and random stuff! The weekly growth updates are awesome and even have a multiples option if you’re having more than one baby! This app is seriously the best pregnancy app. 100% recommend."
76,76,5,2018-11-19T17:17:22.000Z,ALynnaK,Ovia app review,I had already downloaded and had been using a different pregnancy app when a friend of mine recommended Ovia. I loved how much the app had to offer. Being able to easily check what foods are okay to eat and which are not is one of my favorite parts of the app. Also how you can customize the app to what you would like is great. I have a 7 year old step son and being able to compare the size of the baby to an animal instead of a fruit or vegetable is fun for him. The app also randomly post questions for you to make sure you’re staying on track with your prenatals and other things. I would recommend this app to others!
77,77,3,2019-01-31T16:06:18.000Z,ALeosLady,"App is nice, not the community","So, among the nice features of this app, is a ‘community’ in which you can contribute thoughts, experiences, etc."
78,78,1,2019-03-07T16:30:54.000Z,😒🙃🙄😒🙃🙄,people are rude,"The app itself is great, gives kind of a visual on how big the baby should be, articles for each week, and you can ask questions to other moms. However I’ve noticed as a first time mom and other first time moms on there I have a ton of questions that others should be helpful and answer however there are a TON of RUDE people. Its to the point where it’s discouraging to a first time mom to even ask a question and not expect 5 rude answers in return. Definitely not worth it. Maybe they should monitor the comments better and when a person reports a rude comment block the person commenting from continuing to harass the person who reported it. If you are a first time mom and looking for answers to your questions I highly suggest going somewhere else unless you enjoy being talk down upon and rude responses. Deleting this app after this review because I can’t handle bullies. Sorry not sorry."
79,79,4,2020-04-02T08:00:28.000Z,SuziePowell,Just something to add,"I used this app for the first 11 weeks, but found out shortly at my first appointment that I had a missed miscarried at 9 weeks sadly. So with that it really sucked but the app continues to go on as if your pregnancy is normal. Maybe they could add a tab that has options to put in you had a miscarriage. I know most people might just think well just delete the app but it actually wasn’t that easy to just delete after getting so excited, thinking you’d almost became a mom. But maybe this option can be put in place so miscarried moms can still see where the baby would of been at and where it stopped growing. Cause that loss was very hard, especially dealing with the what if’s."
80,80,5,2018-01-08T23:03:32.000Z,Kymmerz93,Love it!!!,"This app is perfect! Every day it gives you advice on your pregnancy and how you’re feeling. You can also put dr’s appointments in, track health information, and look up certain medications to see if they are okay to take during your pregnancy. My favorite part is the community section. I spend hours a day posting and looking at post from woman all around. If I want to know something I can just post it and see if anyone can relate or has answers for whatever it may be. It also has a count down to how many weeks/days you have left. If you are looking for a good app look no further! I absolutely love having Ovia (:"

I first began using ovia over 2 years ago with my youngest daughters pregnancy. I came across it through apple recommendations or related apps. I downloaded countless apps when I found out I was pregnant. Slowly I tried narrowing some down. I wanted one for pictures, pregnancy in general, etc etc."

I love how even as early as that there are pictures to tell me what my baby looked like, at this time a lavender bud. Every day I am given information on how my baby is growing and what to expect. How to hand nausea and morning sickness is the big thing now. Genetic test are talked about and there is an area to ask questions and give peer answers to other moms going through same things. I can’t wait to continue using this app till my baby arrives and see what is happening daily. You can track symptoms, doctors appointments, and more too."
83,83,5,2019-01-28T00:15:26.000Z,Kaitlyn Gilmour,Love this app!,I used Ovia pregnancy for my first pregnancy which I downloaded a couple before I chose to keep Ovia and then I deleted the rest. Even though I had taken child development and a couple of health classes throughout school it was really nice to see what my body was going through and how baby was doing each week. I also downloaded the Ovia parenting app when he was born which was helpful in keeping up frequently asked question at each doctors visit.
84,84,4,2019-02-20T05:51:11.000Z,hatch716,Great App,This app is far-and-away the best pregnancy app out there though. I love it. 💕🙌🏼 I do wish I could find a way to give feedback without having to write a review on App Store every time... (there’s some feedback! 😆 Make it easier to give feedback.)
85,85,5,2019-03-01T10:52:16.000Z,aledda88,On point!,"As I go through my pregnancy, from the very beginning this app has been spot on! From the growth (compared to my OBGYN appts.) to what I’m feeling and the progress. My family loves getting the weekly updates and it’s so easy to screen shot the home page with your update and weeks. It’s so cute to see the tiny baby hands and feet as they grow to what a newborns “average” size comparison would be at birth. So tiny and sweet! Easy to log daily and check off that you are taking your pre-natal vitamin each day! I used the Ovia ovulation before this and was just as good, as we can tell - I’m pregnant! My husband and I are so excited for our first bundle of joy! Thanks Ovia!"

From tracking your sleep, to what you’ve eaten throughout the day, to tracking your blood pressure, to even how you’re feeling, this app makes everything so much easier to keep up with. It sets weight goals, sleep goals, and activity goals and helps ensure you’re your healthiest for you and your baby. I love the ability to jot down little notes, the medication safety lookup and the food safety lookup. There’s not a single thing about this app that I don’t enjoy or use to its fullest potential. Great app all the way! 12/10"
87,87,4,2019-04-12T04:38:12.000Z,anon94830849204,Overall A Nice App,The features are really helpful and overall it’s a good app. It gives you cute things like how big the hands/feet are and how much the baby measures. One of the coolest things was the food lookup guide and med guide.
88,88,4,2020-05-08T02:37:41.000Z,Jmcalist,"Was great for my Singleton, not loving it for my twins",This app was very informative and useful for my first pregnancy. I loved the spot where I could look up safe foods and medications. I like the hand and foot tracker. And the weekly videos were usually cute.
89,89,3,2020-04-27T05:15:51.000Z,MillKate,I like it most the time,I like this app because I can track the size of my baby and other things. However my body reacted to pregnancy far different than I anticipated and although I am usually a very small girl and very athletic my body put on fat pretty quickly. Ovia constantly reminds you not to gain too much weight and to not eat too much etc. cut a woman some slack. I eat the recommended amounts and I work out all the time but I still have gained weight far differently than before I was pregnant. I deleted the weight tracker and it STILL asks me to log my weight. Every other article is about not gaining too much. We are all different in how much we gain ladies and no app needs to hound us constantly about how much we need. Maybe back off a little Ovia.
90,90,4,2018-03-01T18:21:07.000Z,Ines k,Love the app except.........,"I love Ovia. I have used Ovia fertility which helped me conceive and now using Ovia pregnancy. I have to say I’ve been a fan of Ovia ever since my non pregnancy days. I love the layout, I love how they have a community section where you can read other people questions which definetly teaches you a lot also you can ur own question and get response right away. Trust me when ur a worried pregnant soon to be mommy u can’t wait for drs visit to ask any doubts sometimes u need that “it’s gng to be ok” type of feeling right away and Ovia community definetly helps with that."
91,91,5,2018-07-26T04:57:00.000Z,LBloos,First Pregnancy - All info in one place!,"This is my first pregnancy and I’m so excited. I downloaded every pregnancy app I could find and this one is, by far, my favorite. I love the easy health tracking, including mood, physical symptoms, medications, food and water intake, and even blood pressure! This will come in very handy at appointments. Oh! And the app helps you track appointments (and notes for the doctor) as well as pregnancy milestones (like telling your family). It even has a place to write in potential baby names. I love this app."
92,92,4,2018-09-02T01:12:32.000Z,madcat2go,Happy and helped by this app,I really enjoy using this app. It’s really help me keep track of all the items I need to for my pregnancy. I wish that there was more options for someone having twins. I was only able to identify that I was having one child. In addition to keeping track of all the items that you eat it would be really helpful if it were identified as percents of protein or percent of iron and such as to how many cups of something I need to eat. Maybe this is already integrated into the app but I did not see that anywhere so I’m continuously trying to find that online and asking questions online.
93,93,5,2018-11-06T06:22:55.000Z,Tessa0786,Well worth it!,"This app has been well worth the download. I started out with Ovia fertility which really helped pin point when my periods were (not a person that ever tracked) to my bbt, weight etc. loved it! So when I found out I was pregnant, it seemed clear to me to download ovia pregnancy also. It’s kept my dates clear on when I had appts. to little notes about random things. One of my favorite features of this app is the “community” where you can ask questions and read other peoples questions with quick responses And vote on them. It’s fun, interesting and also helpful."
94,94,3,2018-11-07T18:08:33.000Z,KNC19,Great if you have a perfect pregnancy,"I really like this pregnancy app, but it assumes that everything in your pregnancy is going perfectly. I have been nauseous and stuck in the house for my entire pregnancy. The articles aren’t targeted towards people who may be having a more difficult experience. Many of the articles have to do with recipes, listing ways to go out and have fun or pamper yourself....again, those things would be nice, but not every user has a glorious pregnancy. It would be neat if there were  settings options for people who have certain pregnancy complications, which would give this app a more customized feel.  I do enjoy reading the updates about the baby’s development and the app offers some informative tidbits."
95,95,5,2018-11-20T16:49:52.000Z,ZWMeyers,Absolutely Perfect.,"After my first missed period I knew I was pregnant. My sister told me about Ovia because she had used it for her last pregnancy. So I downloaded and it was so informative about every step of the way. Unfortunately I was not able to get to the doctor until 4months so Ovia was my only source of information of what was happening. When I finally was able to be seen, Ovia was right on the money with just how far along I was and even had the exact due date! I highly recommend this app to anyone who’s pregnant especially new mothers who want a lot of insight on what’s going on and things they should be doing."
96,96,5,2020-05-09T20:34:51.000Z,Kittyskullsss,Suggestion for change...,"When you haven’t had an anatomy scan to tell gender (for whatever reason), I feel the app should automatically use gender neutral terms, such as “baby” or “they/them/their”. Grammatically it is correct and it’s much better than the gender changing from week to week."
97,97,5,2020-11-16T00:48:49.000Z,dhhtdxvhyfxbjyrsdghbcghgzvb,Amazing 💖Highly recommend,"This is by far one of the most amazing apps I’ve ever used. It has many different components in one app. It give you daily updates on what’s going on with the baby, how big it is, and what is important for you as the mother to do to make sure your baby can develop at its best. It gives you an area to explore names and it allows you to assort them in which ones you like love and don’t like. It gives you a checklist for you to have when leaving the hospital. It even allows you to speak with other pregnant women. Highly recommend. Would not recommend any other app for pregnant women."
98,98,5,2019-07-04T13:26:53.000Z,BoyMama2019!,The best app!!,"I love this app so much! It has made keeping up with my pregnancy so easy. I love how it tells you something new about your baby everyday! I haven’t had any complications at all! I downloaded SEVERAL pregnancy apps, BUT THIS ONE, ugh, it’s by far the best!!! I hope any mamas out there who read this, download this app and really explore what the app has to offer! There aren’t any fees or ads that interrupt the app, which for me, in itself is a plus! Oh, and congratulations to all of those mamas, too. You’re gonna do great!! Get this app to make everyday even more special as you learn about your baby and see his/her development. Have a blessed day💕"
99,99,4,2020-07-01T12:39:15.000Z,Alebby,Great app could use updates for twins.,Great app. I’ve used it for my first two pregnancies. This time around I’m having twins. I would like the app to recognize the difference and provide twin information but it does not. It also does not allow you to pick the gender of both babies and allows for only one nickname. Another thing I wish it did was keep a archive of the profile pictures you have used instead of just changing the picture to keep the progresss pictures of your pregnancy. I also wish it provided a picture of babies in the womb but twin pregnancy option not only singleton. Just some ideas for the next update. Other than that it’s nice app.
100,100,5,2017-12-02T14:24:13.000Z,GPohlman,Love it!,"This is one of my favorite pregnancy trackers! I love all the features it has like the calendar that keeps track of weeks, doctors appointment, nutrition, activity, milestones like ultrasounds and kicks! This app truly lets you keep track of and helps you remember everything you need to in pregnancy plus it tells you all the new things about your little one and it gives you fun creative comparison objects outside the normal fruits and veggies everyone compares baby size to, although that is an option in there too, the only thing I don’t love about the app is the forum community part but even that would get 3/5 stars from me."
101,101,5,2018-05-06T17:06:45.000Z,Little one 1985,Very useful info,I really enjoy this app compared to when I was pregnant 7 years ago when I would have to look at the internet and search all over for info each week of pregnancy. This app has good info for each week and it has been so fun to be able to see what size my baby is each week and that you can choose the theme of what you want them to compare the size of your child to. This app is also very helpful because it reminds you to take prenatal vitamins and there is a place to put in all of the info/stats for each appointment do you can see your progression. I love this app!
102,102,5,2018-05-12T05:52:51.000Z,Lexycollins,I love this app,I downloaded this app 15 or 16 weeks in because I was using a different app that apparently was free only up till that time. I absolutely love this app and I love that I can keep track of not only weight and milestones but feelings and symptoms too. It makes it so easy to log everything. I can also connect my Fitbit to it to keep track of my steps and activities. I love that it gives you weekly sizes of the baby in 4 different groups. So it’s not only food but funny toys and animals too. It’s cute that it shows an actual size of the hand and foot on your screen for your weeks too. It’s just amazing.
103,103,5,2019-01-11T13:19:53.000Z,090607200621,Great app,"This is my third pregnancy and I didn’t even hesitate to download this app. It is an amazing way tot rack your complete health though your pregnancy! I track my exercise, specific emotions and any symptoms and it makes prenatal appointments a breeze and easy to remember all my questions and give my midwifes detailed info on how baby and I are doing. Also cute images and little windows into how baby and you are doing week to week and fun articles to read. Lastly check out the food watch list on this app and you will always have an easy access list to remind you what is and is not safe to eat during pregnancy."
104,104,5,2019-01-25T20:50:41.000Z,Daya909,Great App,"I love this app. I downloaded it based in the reviews and it didn’t disappoint. I love that I can login my food, exercise, mood, etc. It has allowed me to keep up with how I’m doing and what I need to improve. I also love the articles and suggestions made based on the information I put in. My husband and I can check it on our phones and makes him feel more involved and aware of how I feel and how I’m doing. The only tiny suggestion I have will be to include     month tags or milestones in the calendar. I like seeing the progress in weeks but in months would be nice too. Thank you for this app that is super helpful!"
105,105,4,2019-02-16T20:55:54.000Z,juliacatherine,"Overall, favorite pregnancy app!","I love this app! I like watching the hands and feet get bigger, reading the articles, seeing the short blurbs, and finding out what size my babies are."
106,106,3,2019-05-25T15:36:06.000Z,KD2587,More informative than most but needs export option,"I like this app, but until I recently reached out to support I was not aware that you couldn’t export the information you log in the app to print if needed. This is a huge issue for me and is a huge downfall to this app, it is a must have and I hope someone adds this option soon soon. Also, without the export method, there’s no way that I’ve found to “search” the calendar where you’ve logged notes which means I have to go through every day I’ve logged and find what I’m looking for. Again had I known, I would of logged these in another app that does support these functions. I do love how they send you daily info and reminders to take vitamins though."
107,107,5,2021-01-06T15:18:03.000Z,Jdhgheith,ABSOLUTELY LOVE but...,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP. The only thing that my feelings vary towards is the community posting where you ask questions to other moms. There are a lot of negative nancies who make it seem like its impossible for certain stuff to happen just because it isn’t or hasn’t happened to them. Especially with moms who think they may be carrying multiples, and end up finding out they really are. Believe it or not, a lot of these women can kill your excitement and also discourage you. So if you decide to ask anything, just a warning to proceed with caution. You can take what they say into consideration but DONT LET THEM DISCOURAGE YOU!!!!!!"
108,108,5,2020-12-18T19:24:04.000Z,AnaLop.,A Must During Pregnancy!,"I found out I was pregnant a couple of weeks ago. My husband and I were doing natural family planning and were not planning on having a baby soon. When I found out I was pregnant, I freaked out and had a ton of mixed emotions. That same day I downloaded OVIA and instantly felt so much more at peace. It is everything I need in one app to make sure I am tracking and considering everything I need to know and more in order to have a safe and healthy pregnancy. It helps you feel connected and form a bond with your baby from the very beginning by tracking every developmental milestone day by day."
109,109,4,2019-09-06T14:11:16.000Z,jakaksksldod,Great app but,"This app is amazing if you stayed pregnant the entire time..... we had a miscarriage and this app will not let you record it in any way shape or form, this app doesn’t even acknowledge miscarriage which I find to be extremely frustrating. I want to continue to use this app for my next pregnancy but I just wish the creators would add a way to record a miscarriage. Because it allows you to record all the symptoms of a miscarriage and how you’re feeling but not that actual loss. So please add it in there. It would be extremely therapeutic. I loved this app through the pregnancy and I am going to use it again, but please add the option to report a pregnancy loss."
110,110,4,2017-10-24T13:13:52.000Z,lailalotus,Not the best for multiples,"This is definitely the cutest pregnancy app I've used - it's fun and visually appealing. It also updates with new information every day, which is great! The app makes no adjustments, however, when you input that you're expecting twins or more. This is a major shortcoming compared to some other pregnancy apps, which offer better information in terms of symptoms, timeline, etc. for women carrying multiples. Some of the articles will have a quick aside ""if you're expecting twins..."" but the app as a whole fails to address the experience of a twin pregnancy. I'm not sure why they even bother asking you if you're expecting multiples?"
111,111,5,2018-03-25T04:16:29.000Z,Mercedes Quinn,My go-to Pregnancy app!,"This has been my go-to app during pregnancy! I also used Ovia to track my cycles before getting pregnant, so Ovia has been with me since well-before day 1! My favorite feature is the nutrition tips. I often found myself craving those foods a day or two before they would mention them, and their tips reinforced the idea that my body knew what it was doing and to trust my cravings. Love Ovia! I downloaded several other pregnancy apps just to try them all out, but Ovia Pregnancy has always been my favorite and is the one I always come back to. Thanks for being with me on this journey, Ovia!"
112,112,5,2018-07-15T12:57:28.000Z,Kristretto,Great interface; very informative,"I downloaded the app as soon as I found out I was pregnant with my second baby. I love the different themes, the daily information, and relevant articles to my pregnancy. The weekly size comparisons are adorable and help me connect with my son about the new baby. The medication and food lookups are awesome and very helpful. The only suggestion I have is to be able to save your own frequent medications, as you have to search daily if it’s not on the “most common” list, but that is a minor inconvenience. Overall, it’s exactly what I wanted in a pregnancy app and I’m glad I downloaded it."
113,113,4,2018-09-06T23:31:19.000Z,Lindsayengineer,Great App!,"Great app with helpful ways to track information. I love the weekly videos from Gina and the different options for baby size comparisons. I also like the calendar feature for tracking as much or as little info as you want. A few things I would change: I wish they had a better baby bump photo feature (like the BabyCenter app) and a way to download all the information easily to store for future reference (and to show your baby when they are older). It’s also not very convenient for finding specific notes you made on the calendar. But overall, I used this app my whole pregnancy and was happy with it!"
114,114,3,2018-09-30T12:28:32.000Z,bristykowers,Could features be added for things like IVF?,"I like the weekly updates, photos, and explanations of what is occurring in the body however my path to getting there couldn’t be natural. A lot of the early information references natural conception however so many people use IUI or IVF to achieve pregnancy. Could there be a way to put in your achieved your pregnancy using these methods and words tweaked for these couples- I can’t imagine that would be too difficult and it would be a lot more sensitive to a lot of women who have had a longer road to their pregnancy. Also after I reported an early pregnancy loss when I logged back in it still had the information from the previous pregnancy- which wasn’t fun to look."
115,115,4,2019-03-16T15:29:23.000Z,Lvo328,Good overall,"I’m mostly enjoying this app, with a couple of exceptions. I don’t really appreciate the constant questions about whether I took my prenatal vitamin or not, nor do I like some of the other fairly invasive questioning.  This may just be annoying to me personally, who knows? I’ve also noticed that since I mentioned that I have experienced anxiety in the past, there is a huge focus on mental heath on my feed- I get including info on that once in awhile, but it’s excessive at times. Finally, occasionally I cannot locate the daily info about my baby’s development- it won’t show up until a day later, which seems like a glitch."
116,116,5,2019-05-29T21:44:07.000Z,Layna Lampkin,My favorite health tracker for pregnancy,"I used Ovia as my period tracker, and the regular app helped me identify my fertile window when we were trying to conceive. Now I’m 37 weeks pregnant, and I love using the Ovia pregnancy app. I love tracking my symptoms daily and being able to add little notes everyday, and that my data syncs to my Apple health app. I also love that the app creates graphs of my weight gain and blood pressure over the weeks. I read the weekly updates in addition to the free BabyCenter and What to Expect apps’ updates. The anonymous community is also a major and unique plus of this app! I would recommend this app to all pregnant women!"
117,117,5,2019-11-09T13:51:14.000Z,DlynnR,Sad,This app worked great for me for the entirety of my pregnancy until it updated a week ago. I’m 39 weeks pregnant today and haven’t been able to use my contraction timer or kick counter I can’t even scroll down to see any new updates or see what size the baby is this week the app completely crashed when I needed it the most. It worked perfect for months then come 38-39 weeks of my gestation it completely stopped working. It’s an overall great app which is why I continued to use it as my pregnancy tracker throughout my entire gestation but now when I need it the most it doesn’t work.
118,118,5,2020-12-23T15:44:50.000Z,anniebobannie,Love!,"I absolutely love this pregnancy app. I’ve used it for all of my pregnancies - including two miscarriages. I am so grateful for the features it has available for women who go through pregnancy loss. They planned a gentle and warm response to a very difficult time that prevented painful notifications and reminders. I used it all the way through my daughter’s pregnancy, and the naming feature, registry checklist, and kick counter were some of my favorite features! I recommend this app to all of my pregnant friends. Currently 17 weeks with a boy and grateful for the articles and information letting me know I’m right on track!"
119,119,5,2021-01-21T15:17:53.000Z,Beri15,You will regret NOT downloading this app!,"As a first time mom this application has helped me through the stages of my pregnancy. I was caught off guard when I heard I was pregnant and I instantly wanted to know how my body was going to change how my baby would develop and this app does just exactly that and MORE! I also love how Gina talks about her weekly experience, her ups and downs. If you don’t have someone who is supporting you through this wonderful time, Gina will make you feel like you have a friend who understands what you are going through!! I also love all the resource articles that are included!"
120,120,5,2018-07-31T01:41:55.000Z,skrush,Great app! Worth having as an expecting mom,"Great app! I’ve learned a lot from this app. It gives great insight on how your baby is developing and common symptoms a mother will feel during stages of pregnancy. Some of the articles are amazing to learn from like dieting- they give examples of a daily meal plan. I just wish they had a quick reference tab or mark as favorite- for these types of topics to be easily found. If not, you have to try to recall where the article was and scroll to find it again. That would be a great update for the markers of this app. Other than that, I’ve enjoyed this app!"
121,121,5,2018-09-22T05:17:56.000Z,kaja9584,More features,"This is not my favorite pregnancy app. It IS the only one I use however because it is the easiest to navigate and the most accurate! It would be super neat if some more features were added, like being able to take baby bump pictures to keep track of “belly progress”, and more things for the community aspect. Make it to where we can add groups and such and feel more like a “community”.  While keeping the anonymous if anyone wants to use it. Just think that would be cool- either way, it’s a super good app and I would recommend to everybody"
122,122,5,2019-01-05T17:16:56.000Z,Sarierosie,References,"I really appreciate how transparent the information is. The references are easily accessible, and even easier to check out yourself. Plus, most of the sources are from scholarly journals and or backed by credible research."
123,123,5,2019-04-18T09:05:19.000Z,Mimigirl032,Best Pregnancy App out there!,"This app provides everything you need! It enables you to keep track of your nutrition, vitamins, doctors appointments and even has little reminders. I love how there are quick little articles on everything from where to buy a reasonable crib to how to deal with morning sickness. I also used the weekly nutritional tips based on baby’s development. This is my 3rd baby and I still learned a lot through this app. Great for first time moms and those who are more experienced. There is also a setting for if you’re having multiples as well! All in all 5 stars!"
124,124,5,2020-05-03T14:02:45.000Z,blessedlife 3,So great!,"I’ve used Ovia for 4 years now with my first, then with my second, and with my third whom I gave birth to a couple days ago.. it’s such a great app! It asks if you’ve taken your prenatal pill, how baby’s development is and how you’re body is changing , the best for me is the community chat, you can ask questions , concerns, or just simply vent and other women around the world with Ovia can reply, all while being anonymous and it’s so great to know you’re not the only one who goes through certain things and get so much comfort and reassurance. I love Ovia, thank you so much ! I recommend it 1000%"
125,125,3,2021-03-17T02:46:30.000Z,que el si,Great app but food tracking can be improved,"So far I love the app. I like the different themes to choose from. I really like being able to look up symptoms as well as okay foods and okay medicines. Being able to track how much you’re getting of each food group is great too. However, I think there is a bug with that because it keeps showing food I tracked yesterday in today’s view. I live in japan so not sure if doesn't support time zones. I haven’t noticed this problem with other things i have tracked."
126,126,5,2020-08-07T07:15:58.000Z,abbybrewm,Best Pregnancy App!!!!! And it’s FREE!!!,"I LOVE this app. So much good information, and so fun. The community is active and a great place to hear personal experiences. Looking at all the comparable objects to imagine the size of our baby with my husband is a great way to involve him in the pregnancy. I love the food, symptom, and medicine look up tools!!!!!"
127,127,5,2019-07-01T17:04:37.000Z,Laurabeth46,Favorite pregnancy app!,"I used Ovia Fertility tracker to get pregnant and now I use Ovia Pregnancy to track everything going on with the baby! I love it. Every week my husband and I read the fun things baby is the size of this week. I also really appreciate the mental health connector feature, the calendar where I can save pictures and notes, and the community section where I can ask questions to other moms. The only down side is that when you load a picture in the calendar and also a description, it loads really slow. Besides that, everything else is great!"
128,128,5,2021-03-10T13:16:24.000Z,armywife101216,Great pregnancy app,When I got pregnant with my first child in 2018 I tried so many pregnancy tracking apps but I found that Ovia was the best one for me. I loved reading the info from the pregnancy by week part of the app and it was super easy to track my health. And all of the articles really helped for concerns that I might have had about my growing baby and gave me great things to ask my doctor about. I love the app so much that I used it for my second child and now I’m currently using it because I just found I was pregnant with my third so thanks Ovia for being an app I can count on
129,129,5,2020-12-27T19:32:19.000Z,Kinzey J,I love all of their apps!,"After I quit using the depo shot as birth control (highly recommend avoiding depo) I didn’t have a period for around 8 months. When my periods did start they were so irregular and were hard to track. Ovia made it so easy to track them until the regulated back out. Then when I got pregnant the pregnancy tracker was full of details about baby, my body, tips, healthy recipes, etc. The parenting app helped keep track of milestones my baby should be hitting. Overall I highly recommend these apps and have used them for all three of my pregnancies."
130,130,5,2018-06-08T10:34:08.000Z,Riptalia,Amazing app!,This app has been on point with what I am going through each week! It has so many features it will keep you busy. I love being able
131,131,5,2018-08-30T00:56:42.000Z,Crosswork,"5 stars, of course!!!","Ovia helped us on our Journey to get pregnant and as soon as our pregnancy was confirmed we immediately downloaded the ovia pregnancy app. This is the best App for pregnancy. I highly recommend it. The accuracy of each stage, the weekly hand and foot prints of the actual size, the weekly videos, advice and guidance, things you didn’t consider that are helpful, insurance information, maternity leave information, dietary, contraction tracker, just to name a few. This is priceless information. Excellent resource and a flood gate of information. If I could if 10 stars I would. Hahaha"
132,132,3,2018-10-11T17:17:15.000Z,SEA Run Mom,"Fun content, but sloppy and sometimes condescending","It’s nice to track the size and get daily updates, but it seems like there is very little editing in this app. I’ve found so many typos, and have read multiple articles in the app that have directly contradicting information."
133,133,5,2019-03-24T22:27:53.000Z,JessieAnne62,Best pregnancy app!,"When I found out I was pregnant, I had been using the Ovia fertility app, to track my cycle and ovulation, and it suggested the ovia pregnancy app, and of course, I downloaded at least 5-10 other pregnancy apps to see which was best and Ovia is the best by far! From the info week by week, little tidbits of info that is really interesting about the baby’s development, the ability to track so many different symptoms, milestones, appointments, ultrasound pictures, notes about anything like telling family/friends, baby bump pictures...it’s hands down the best!!!"
134,134,1,2019-04-11T14:45:18.000Z,mscgmama,Ovia makes money sharing your intimate data with your boss and insurance co,"Please look up the Washington Post article “Is your pregnancy app sharing your intimate data with your boss?” highlighting spevically how Ovia uses incentive programs to profit on sharing your most vulnerable details, including your sex life, menstrual cycles, & high risk pregnancy factors with both your employers and health insurance companies. The CEO of Ovia is quoted in the article saying that the women’s health crisis “is impacting the folks who are responsible for these outcomes—both financially and for the health of the members they’re accountable for.” Those are his own words in the belief that companies responsible for our health care need to keep a surveillance eye on what is happening with our own bodies and babies. I deleted my Ovia app and my pregnant & new moms groups are all outraged and doing the same. Boycott Ovia!!"
135,135,5,2019-05-27T15:13:30.000Z,yhnub,One of the best,"I have downloaded and tried several different pregnancy apps, and I can definitely say this is by far my favorite. It is very helpful in many ways but unlike other pregnancy apps, this one updates daily with new information. As long as you refresh the page every once in a while, new information shows up. Other apps update weekly. But now that I’m on a review, if you want to see the actual development of your baby within the womb, “pregnancy+” has the best 3D photos of the fetus, your belly, and example sonograms."
136,136,4,2019-08-03T22:11:48.000Z,M_Shan,Great overall but needs some serious improvements,"I love this app. I love the illustrations for the week-by-week, the meds lookup, considerations for different medical conditions, etc."
137,137,3,2021-06-12T22:58:44.000Z,EDZ0987,What about miscarriages?,"The only way to end a pregnancy on the app is to report a birth… but what if you miscarry?? I miscarried my last baby at 15 weeks and there was no way to just delete the pregnancy without “reporting a birth” or un-installing the app. I did uninstall the app, but then I was still getting updates via email about a baby that was no longer there. I reinstalled for my next pregnancy and it still had all of the old info from the miscarriage front and center… harsh reminder when I finally got over it. I love the tracking features and articles/videos, but not every pregnancy works out and I feel like the app could be a little more sensitive to that."
138,138,5,2021-05-21T22:45:56.000Z,GrownUpAndTired,Best option has everything,The app has everything  you could need including a food and drug safety list. There aren’t ads everywhere.  No horrifying “community boards” that become the overwhelming flaming dumpster anxiety causing sad pregnancy posts. It doesn’t send a million notifications. It’s literally designed to be a place for your peace of mind. I’ve tried all the others and they were just too much. More about all the bells and whistles and not getting Down to what’s going on with you and your pregnancy. I can’t give this app enough praise.
139,139,4,2019-07-11T13:21:15.000Z,Platapus14,Twins!!!,"I love this pregnancy app, it’s the best one I’ve found. It’s helpful to ask other women using the app my questions before I think something is wrong with me. The only reason this app isn’t getting five stars is because when I told the app I was having twins, nothing changed. It still acts as though I’m expecting one. It won’t let me put both genders in, and it doesn’t offer more twin information when I open the app. If I want to find out something about twin pregnancy I have to search for an article in the app. I do still love this app, and how user friendly it is. I definitely would recommend."
140,140,4,2018-04-17T03:00:26.000Z,EmClay!,Great App!,"I loved the app with my first baby! I’m expecting my second, and although I don’t have as much time to check it as I did before, I still enjoy what I have time to see on there! I always like reading the weekly update—the experiences/symptoms by week are always spot on! However, the medication list is extremely strict. I followed it closely with my first baby, but this time I’ve been checking with my doctor and found that he is a lot more lenient than the app—so always ask your doctor!! Sometimes I spot grammatical errors and typos. I’d be willing to proofread for them if they’d let me!! I love proofreading! 😉"
141,141,5,2019-02-04T04:46:01.000Z,ChicoChubbykins,I love this app,This is my second pregnancy and it’s crazy to think of how much you can forget between each one. It’s a great tool for tracking the differences in my pregnancies having a place to keep track of my symptoms and questions to take to my doctors appointments! I wish this app would remind you of your questions before your appointment without having to write them on the date of your next appointment. Overall I love every little bit of this app and will use it again and again for all of my pregnancies
142,142,2,2019-02-27T13:55:35.000Z,Sabrina31797,"Love the app, hate the community","Not going to lie I deleted this app because I became a first time mom and wanted some support and help. I had the Ovia period tracker and loved being able to talk to other women who were concerned about irregular periods and such. They were kind and understanding. However, once I fell pregnant I switched to the pregnancy version and couldn’t believe how nasty the women are! I would make posts about my concerns and struggles and in return I got bashed for being “stupid” and that I needed to “get over” what I was going though. I hate losing faith in humanity but apps like these make it super easy to happen. Download the app if you want tips on where you are in your pregnancy but stay away from the know-it-all parents."
143,143,4,2019-04-10T23:05:16.000Z,steshalemc,"Easiest to use, only minor small shortcomings",Pros: 1) Easy to use/intuitive platform
144,144,4,2019-04-18T12:46:02.000Z,Kcotamac,Great but awful message board,"Great app with a professional tone for articles. Lots of great reading and I love how new articles and facts appear through the day. The different size comparison themes are so cute, too! My only real complaint is the community section. It's TERRIBLE. If you're looking for an app with good boards, don't bother. It limits character use for questions, makes the poster put two options for readers to ""vote"" before comments can be read, and there isn't a clear notifications system when someone replies to your own posted question. If you don't care about the boards, it's a great app."
145,145,5,2021-01-22T22:34:11.000Z,MCloats,Helpful and fun,I know there are a ton of apps out there but I really love Ovia’s. It’s really helpful to have tidbits about baby’s development as it relates to the stage of pregnancy but also as a result of information I input. I use the data side of the app daily and just love to check each week and see what size baby is now and how much their hand/feet have grown! It’s also a great resource to break the ice on some topics and read brief articles that then I can remind myself to write questions from for my appointments. I haven’t reached labor yet but I know the timers are going to be clutch!
146,146,5,2020-01-10T22:58:46.000Z,KHPut,Love this!,My wife has been using this app and after her sharing the first few weeks of progress I had to have it on my phone. Now I can read about the changes my wife is going through and watch our little one’s progress in my free time. I highly recommend to other fathers and soon to be fathers! Knowing what changes my wife is going through and understanding these changes helps me love on her the way she needs to be loved and be more understanding when pregnancy related issues pop up. Pregnancy truly is beautiful and amazing!
147,147,5,2020-01-03T11:16:49.000Z,CHMenard,Love this App!,"Love this app!  I love that i can track so many details about my symptoms and what i ate.. that way I can tell my Dr something if I need to by looking back through my app!! And all the articles... the more info you track about your pregnancy, the more the articles are tailored to you specifically! This app also lets you include your partner by emailing them daily updates about your pregnancy! I enjoy sending updates and articles from the app to my mom and dad, as well. It helps keep everyone connected during such a special time!"
148,148,2,2021-01-05T13:20:55.000Z,Nicky Alv,App remains on screen but deletes all info,"I really love all the features that this app has to offer. I’ve been using it since I first discovered I was pregnant, over 6 months ago. But there is a major problem. It has deleted all my information twice now. The app icon will remain on my screen, but, when I click on it, it appears as though I don’t have an account. This is incredibly frustrating because each time now I have re-done everything and it takes a lot of time. I would enter in a lot of info to track everything in my pregnancy, and it just vanishes. This will now be the third time I’m “signing” up again. I don’t think I will because it’s too much of a hassle. Can Ovia fix this?"
149,149,1,2019-07-05T14:14:09.000Z,nnoman,Annoying bugs and ads,"This app will help track your pregnancy, though I prefer The Bump. The reason is that Ovia has lots of annoying bugs, one of which is the weight tracking feature which has been fully broken for several months. Very frustrating and they just won't fix it. It won't show me my past data (why did I bother entering it?) and there's no option to export. It also shows my weight trend as being outside the healthy zone even though it's been within the goal area. Worse though are the constant ads for breast pumps and cord blood banking. By the way, since most hospitals do delayed cord clamping, there is basically no need for cord blood banking. Enough of these ads. Seems misleading for a pregnancy app to confuse pregnant women with these ads."
150,150,4,2018-04-20T20:33:26.000Z,msinterrobang,Four stars because of one issue,"I’ve used the Ovia Fertility and Ovia Pregnancy apps and the only thing I dislike about them is how they do not read from the Health app. Before trying to conceive and then becoming pregnant, I used plenty of health apps to track my fitness, weight, sleep and nutrition. Ovia doesn’t read from any of them so I end up using the Glow apps as well. If they could read and write to the Health app, I could abandon Glow completely and rely solely on Ovia like I want to. As this is the only issue I have with the app, I still highly recommend it for everyone, but with that small reservation."
151,151,3,2018-08-19T00:11:33.000Z,Cortneys7775,It’s okay,"I don’t really like that you can’t update your weeks and due date and last menstrual date manually without the other dates changing. I know when my last menstrual day was, but because the doctor told me a different due date and different weeks the app wants to change my last menstrual date too? It’s annoying because the information isn’t accurate anymore because the app is trying to tell me what is right when I know what’s right more than the app does. I also wish that they incorporated an accurate depiction of what the fetus looks like, like the Baby Center app does instead of a cartoon character fetus."
152,152,5,2018-11-08T11:34:32.000Z,T. Pot,Great app for me AND hubby,"We are first timers and are so excited and hungry for information and this app has been great. It reminds me to take my vitamins, gives daily updates on baby developments, and by entering my partner’s email he now gets the updates, can read the articles, and has a heads up on how I might be behaving and feeling as the weeks go by. Being able to enter symptoms and emotions each day is helpful. And I love the food and symptom look up so I’m not googling things all day. Very comprehensive and easy to use. Highly recommend."
153,153,5,2018-11-25T16:50:26.000Z,Tiffany K..,Outstanding app for expecting moms,"My sister-in-law recommended this app while my husband and I were trying to conceive (Ovia Fertility) and also once we found out the wonderful news that we were pregnant (Ovia Pregnancy). Being a first time mom obviously comes with many questions and concerns. Without having to search the internet for answers, Ovia conveniently provides daily and weekly information pertaining to both mom and baby. I have been able to have a piece of mind and thoroughly enjoy each step of my pregnancy thanks to Ovia."
154,154,5,2018-12-06T01:23:26.000Z,L_S_Ellis,Best App for Mommies-To-Be,"If I could give them 6 stars I would! I have used a number of different apps but this one is my favorite by far. We used Ovia when ttc and it was great, got pregnant so quickly! And the pregnancy app is just as good. I like the personalized articles with real scientific evidence for every day of my pregnancy. And I love the option to track my health, nutrition, exercise, doctors appointment, milestones, EVERYTHING you could want to track all in one app. If you are pregnant, or thinking about getting pregnant, Ovia is the best choice out there. And it’s all for free!!! Thanks Ovia!"
155,155,5,2018-12-14T06:01:06.000Z,kaylawallace91,Should be everyone’s favorite pregnancy app!,I check this 3-6 days a week! I was told to check this app out by one of the nurses that works at my doctors. I love everything about this app. There are so many useful features that I have yet to explore and use more. I love the daily and weekly updates and information it provides on your growing baby! I am currently 22.5 weeks along. I’ve enjoyed sharing the weekly growth info to my partner so he knows what myself/mommy is going through and what our baby is up to! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
156,156,4,2019-01-27T16:54:12.000Z,5309aaronsmom,"Great, wish I could tweak it","Overall, the app is wonderful! My tweaks would be that when the health quizzes come up about health conditions you have marked you have- they would tell you the answers so you know if you’re wrong in what you think."
157,157,5,2019-02-13T13:50:50.000Z,Cariboulli,Extremely Helpful and Easy to Use,"I’m a first time mom and prior to becoming pregnant I knew next to nothing about pregnancy, babies, etc. This app has been extremely helpful in giving me information on what to expect, what I might be experiencing, tracking my baby’s development, and other really important, need-to-know things. It’s so convenient because everything is all in one app, and it’s so easy to use! Ovia Pregnancy even gives you recipes and ideas about other awesome apps (Babylist - for your registry). I highly recommend this app!!!"
158,158,5,2021-04-08T13:03:11.000Z,IVFmomma,IVF/FET mommies,"I’ve just had my first embryo transfer and downloaded a slew of free pregnancy apps and this is the one for IVF moms. It gives you information and details and pictures starting as early as the day of your embryo transfer. Just google your IVF due date (I like using Flo website) and use that date to get it started! It’s also not spammed full of ads (although there are some.) It told me what was developing with embryo, when implantation should be taking place and completed, when I should be able to take a pregnancy test, etc."
159,159,5,2020-12-18T23:15:10.000Z,Adraluca,Best app,"I love the Ovia apps! I’ve used other apps to track my ovulation and no success. Every time I recorded anything in my daily notes, the app would keep changing my ovulation date and my whole Fertility window was off. I know because I was tracking my ovulation daily with clear blue electronic ovulation kit. Finally I came across Ovia and the dates as well as my fertile window were accurate. Now I’m using the Ovia pregnancy app and keeping track of everyday changes in my pregnancy. It’s easy to use and gives lots of helpful info daily."
160,160,5,2018-01-18T15:23:23.000Z,JenRodgers0145,Love it,This is my first baby so I really didn’t know what to expect. This app has been really helpful in explaining the different changes and symptoms that come with being pregnant. I love the food lookup feature to see what’s safe and what’s not and the delivery countdown. I also really look forward to the weekly baby updates and description of what the baby may be doing. I check the app everyday honestly. The different articles are interesting too and tailored to fit you personally. Definitely recommend.
161,161,5,2018-05-07T16:58:50.000Z,Cutieeskittles,Better than buying pregnancy books,I bought three pregnancy books when I found out I was pregnant. Ovia has completely replaced two of them bc it all all the information I could possibly need. It successfully combines pregnancy advice with a safe medications and foods database. I can also personalize my baby’s growing journey by naming it and answering questions that let Ovia tailor my feed to what I need to know. It’s just a great app. And I love the daily emails telling me new things about my baby and new tips and tricks to make pregnancy better.
162,162,5,2018-05-09T15:29:36.000Z,LondonPanda22,Absolutely Love!,Ovia was my first app ever to use when my boyfriend and I were trying to conceive. When we finally did the app suggested to download the Ovia pregnancy app. I did not hesitate. I love everything about this app. I’m able to have a general idea and sizes about my beautiful baby. I’m able to take belly bump pictures and document all the milestones I’ve experienced. Being a first time mom this app has me knowing what to expect. I recommend all my friends to both apps for those that are trying and those who are pregnant.
163,163,4,2018-05-11T09:01:50.000Z,Sun_not_the_moon,Needs to accommodate for multiples,"I absolutely love this app. I love that you can quickly look up food and medication safety and input your symptoms and it'll tell you if something is wrong or if everything is okay. It gives you updates on baby in the cutest ways. The ""weird but cute animals"" is my favorite theme."
164,164,5,2018-05-29T14:12:18.000Z,TatyanaKush,Best app I’ve ever used.,"Throughout my pregnancy I’ve tried a lot of different pregnancy apps but Ovia Pregnancy is the one I stuck with. I found myself always going to this one out of all the other ones because it’s easy to use, it’s fun and you can make it personal. I love how you can make a theme and early on change it according to the gender of your baby. This app is so informative and helpful in any way possible. The part I enjoyed the most though is watching baby’s foot and hand grow! Thanks for making this app so great."
165,165,4,2018-09-29T02:01:37.000Z,tnscnormama,"I love it, but...","I love this app, although I don’t  like how the fertility app doesn’t cross over information when you switch to pregnancy mode."
166,166,4,2018-10-15T17:14:22.000Z,Mee667,Very helpful.,"Love the app. However, when I’m looking through the community posts, and someone posts on one I have and it pops down from the bottom of my screen I’m constantly clicking accidentally and losing my spot. Half the time I’m going to hit the “back” button or “submit” to post a question of my own, click the notification and lose my spot. It’s frustrating. Maybe change that somehow, or make the bar bigger so I can actually slide it out of the way. Every time I try to slide that thin little bar it clicks it and I lose the screen I’m on."
167,167,5,2021-01-19T13:40:04.000Z,Svickery0125,Easily Convenient and Everything you need,"This pregnancy app is wonderful. It takes you on a journey with your little one as they grow and keeps you updated on the things you should know/do during each phase of pregnancy. There are delivery aids such as a kick counter. I haven’t personally come to have any problems with it, just know their is adds on some things and they sometimes make it look important which can be frustrating if you don’t have access to the whole app."
168,168,5,2020-10-04T02:27:00.000Z,Aliiiii 👅,only ONE thing I would love to see changed!,I love using this app so far. It keeps everything in one place and has a lot of resources such as food / medication look up to make sure things are safe during pregnancy. The ONLY thing I would change is when you hit the magnify glass under symptoms or feelings if that you could select MULTIPLE things at once instead of having to click back into the list each times if it isn’t something already on the prepopulated list.
169,169,1,2019-06-11T12:54:30.000Z,oreggues,Creepy questions,"The number of personal questions this website asks is deeply troubling. Not clear what they’re doing with this info, or who they’re selling it to. But it certainly has nothing to do with being able to use the app. Proceed with caution."
170,170,5,2017-10-07T16:32:22.000Z,Ny16829,Great app,"This app literally gives you so much information. It can tell you what foods are and aren’t safe, it can tell you the cause of symptoms you might be having, it tells what’s going on with your baby throughout the week and how big he/she is. And keeps track of how many weeks you are.  It also has a kick counter and contraction timer. It also can tell if you if certain medications are safe. I was recommended this app and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is pregnant."
171,171,4,2018-07-01T02:25:12.000Z,kuetie31,Great App!,I loved this app during pregnancy.  Some great features including being able to share articles and fruit sizes with various family members.   Also liked that it was easy to send the articles for my husband to read.  They’re short enough to read on a break at work yet informative.   I also agree with another persons review though as to why I gave the app 4 stars as after my due date I had no more articles or info to read and I was 9 days late!  It was something that I really looked forward too especially at the end.
172,172,5,2018-07-17T17:07:31.000Z,MWilson10,Best Pregnancy App Out There,"I have tried several pregnancy apps but honestly this is the only one I kept and the only one you need. It is both inspiring and informative. Some apps scared me too much, with all the things that could go wrong with my pregnancy, and then some had no information at all. Ovia is a perfect balance, with inspiring information as I tracked my food and activity intake, a helpful food safety and medication lookup, and articles relating to whatever pregnancy symptom or area you are worried about. Get Ovia, you precious momma, you!"
173,173,4,2019-01-06T15:55:25.000Z,LDWA,Great app - Too many adds,"I’ve been using Ovia for a month or so now, and I love all the information in it. The user interface is also very easy to get used to and makes the app simple to use. There are more features than I use on a daily basis (I don’t track my food servings, for example)."

I love how it shows how big the baby’s feet and hands are each week and how customizable it is! I love reading each week and it includes my baby’s name and the real gender. It’s super easy to use which I like as well, some apps are too complicated and have too much going on. What I look for in a pregnancy app is weekly development updates, growth patterns, and customizability and this app has all three! Exactly what I’ve been looking for. 100% recommended this app!"
176,176,5,2021-03-11T19:30:01.000Z,Schalinske,So easy to use!,"This is such a great app for expecting parents! Easy to use and understand and has so many features that you can utilize! It tracks development and gives you a daily update, it can also time your contractions when you go into labor. I mostly use it to track development for not just the baby but myself and what to expect as a mom while carrying the baby but it will also track your appointments, moods, mental health, what you eat, etc. This app is an all in one for me!"

It gives you week by week information, you can see how big your baby is compared to other things, there’s a food/medication safety list, you can see what the baby looks like in the womb, and there’s many other cool things about this app. I’m a first time mom and have had many questions throughout my pregnancy, Ovia allows you to ask questions to other moms and it’s my favorite part of the app. Any new time moms, I highly recommend this app to you!"
179,179,2,2021-01-12T23:00:33.000Z,RaeEst24,Great If It Opens,"I’ve used the app through two pregnancies now and am extremely happy with it when it works. Now, however, it’s logged me out and will not open up. I’ve tried to log in again, and each time it gives me a message that my session expired and I need to log in again. I do that and the cycle repeats. I’m irritated because I just want to get into the app and log things from my pregnancy, but it won’t open."
180,180,5,2017-12-20T05:24:49.000Z,aaaaaaagiiiiirlllltou,So helpful!,"Really the best app ! I used another one unltil I seen Ovia on a Facebook ad, and it's really so helpful! Being able to ask other moms questions, if you are worried , and to share your journey is really exciting, and stress relieving. Also being able to track your pregnancy so well , is great! Download it ! Only wish that they made it so you could post a picture along with an anonymous status! That way it would be another thing you could share with the moms! Amazing app though!"
181,181,3,2018-02-18T04:45:40.000Z,not a happy overseer,Crashes too often/glitches,I’m also having a problem with the initial loading of the app crashing the first time and then completely loading the second try. It also crashes in the middle of using the app as well. Goes to a black screen for 30 seconds or so before it closes out. As well as trying to scroll through the message boards it likes to jump from the top of a subject through the comments to bottom and back on it’s own making it very difficult to read anything. Would be a great app if the bugs were fixed.
182,182,5,2018-05-09T16:04:28.000Z,APouslen93,Super helpful,"As a new (almost) mom, this app has been extremely helpful. Better than any of the other apps I have tried. It’s been fun knowing the size of my baby and exactly what’s going on and what will be going on with my body. It also has a full lists of foods to eat and not to eat which has been a super big help to me! I am definitely a worry wart and the app always gives me words of encouragement based off the moods and symptoms I enter in each day! Would highly recommend"
183,183,5,2018-07-28T23:00:03.000Z,SLuma32,Best pregnancy app out there!,"I used the Ovia fertility app when I was trying to conceived and LOVED it, so naturally I downloaded their pregnancy app once I got that big fat positive! Love this app the best, even after downloading about 5 other ones just to see what else was out there. This has a great mix of updates and fun facts, as well as the cool graphic of how big baby’s hands and feet are. I also love all the features for tracking symptoms, weight, doc visits. I use the list of safe medicines a LOT too! So much in one package with this app!"

I look forward to using the parenting app. My one recommendation is that it takes way too long to access the contraction timer feature. Even if I’m fast, I’m already 15-20 seconds into my contraction before I can get that feature to load. I would love to see that feature be more accessible since it’s such a matter of timing! I love everything else about the app, thank you Ovia!"
185,185,4,2018-11-13T10:08:17.000Z,awXiomara,Great with little issues!,I’m expecting my first and I love this app but they need to fix the whole he/she in the information pages. I’ve put unknown since I don’t know yet and it’s super annoying to be reading “she this” and “she that”. I find that super bothersome!
186,186,5,2019-05-28T13:59:17.000Z,NatSark,Ovia Apps,I used the Ovia Fertility app to help track my cycles while going through infertility treatment. Now I am 28 weeks pregnant and have been using the Ovia Pregnancy app. It was a easy transition and has been so informative. Every day there is something new to read about your baby. I love to track my different symptoms and instantly be given a little blurb on what’s going on in my body. I also use the share button on articles and highlights of how my baby is growing to send to my family and husband.
187,187,5,2021-03-31T12:46:47.000Z,Dreamvillainess,Great for 1st Time Moms,"I’m a first time mom and to say that I’ve been overwhelmed by information is an understatement. The Ovia app is simple to use and is very informative. There are recommended articles every day and the feature to log your appointments, health, moods etc. Is my favorite part of this app. I feel like I can easily navigate the information but also love that I can always go to any date on the calendar and log how I’m feeling and any symptoms I may be experiencing. Simple, easy to use, and very helpful."
188,188,4,2021-01-18T19:48:51.000Z,Stephanie Hourigan,Great app,"Overall I highly recommend this app. It has everything from tracking your baby’s growth, your weight, plugging in doctors appointments, etc. plus comes with articles you can look up or they have ones that pop up that are current with your pregnancy time. Also I loved that I could look something up right away and more than likely get an answer. Especially with food or drinks. I’m a new momma so I honestly didn’t know what was ok to eat and drink while pregnant. We’re all learning the best we can and this app certainly helped me."
189,189,5,2020-02-13T15:04:36.000Z,Arim1819,Favorite app,"I use this app and another pregnancy tracker app, but this is by far my favorite! They give you daily updates on what your baby is doing and even about how you may be feeling. You can input your symptoms and health history. They have helpful articles, and they also have a place where you can check to see if the food and medicine you are eating and taking is safe or unsafe. For a first time mom I really love this app and will recommend to anyone I know who becomes pregnant."
190,190,5,2017-11-15T08:20:47.000Z,mamabear051518,Best app so far,"Love this app so much, I have 2 other apps as well and tried a couple others prior to those, but Ovia is by far the best app out there. I love it because my due date is about off for how many weeks I am so instead of having to change my due date to actually be on the correct weeks, I can just change my weeks and keep my due date 😄 which makes me very happy. Overall great app, look up symptoms, medicines that are okay, kick counter, and plenty more!"
191,191,5,2018-01-15T15:36:00.000Z,Jazzy Jana,Love this app!,"I’m a first time mom and while there many apps out there friends and family members suggested I chose Ovia! This app has been amazing! I love reading new information each week in my pregnancy. Additionally, I love the little baby facts, health related information and nutritional information they include on the timeline daily. I would love to see my baby growing with my actual eyes but obviously that’s only possible with an ultrasound but this app makes it easy to track my baby’s development!"
192,192,5,2018-02-01T15:33:41.000Z,Laurenvieira,Love this app!,"Many of the really good apps are paid for, and some are so expensive like $7/mo. I am so happy I found this app for free and it has a lot of awesome features. A ton of tracking features like tracking your weight, water consumption, diet, kick counts, even more stuff than I could imagine tracking. Lots of helpful information too! I love seeing the size of the baby’s hands and feet on the home page. Overall I’d definitely recommend this app over any others I’ve tried!"
193,193,5,2018-06-03T12:15:27.000Z,Mama Seun,Knowledgeable app,"I truly enjoy using this app. It has helped me to track my ovulation and now that I am pregnant, I am able to track my pregnancy. I use this app daily to see how baby is growing, what symptoms I will be experiencing, etc. I use this app in conjunction with The Bump and What to Expect When Pregnant and this app is my fav out of the three. My fav feature is the calendar where it tracks for me how many weeks I am. I schedule my appointments there as well. I would recommend this app to everyone!"
194,194,5,2018-06-20T01:00:28.000Z,NotJoMama❤️,Helps make the waiting fun,"This is my second baby and second time using the app (2 1/2 years later)Lots of awesome new features and tools. Each week that goes by (even if it was loaded with morning sickness and exhaustion, as these early weeks are this time around) it’s fun to see what little fruit or veggie is floating around in my belly, and learn about what happening now."
195,195,4,2018-08-09T11:14:32.000Z,CBekis,"Love the app, but...","Love the application but I wish there was an app for the Apple Watch for easy access for contraction counter, kicks, and alerts for weekly term announcement. I have found an app that does that, but I love this app with all the information handy. So I have two apps almost doing the same thing minus more access- just one app would have been great."
196,196,5,2018-08-29T04:00:11.000Z,PreggoNoMo,Very useful and informative,"I liked having this app for when I was pregnant with my first baby. It’s easy to use for the most part, fun, and informative. I loved the weekly updates of the baby’s size and development. I LOVED the community feature. I asked questions and answered questions a lot! I was able to look back on my posts for my baby book which was a plus! I also used the edge park ad on the app for my FREE Medela breast pump so that was really helpful! I recommend this app for any first time mommy!"
197,197,5,2018-09-11T15:02:06.000Z,Lvnn987,Doesn’t scare soon to be moms!!!,I’ve downloaded a few different pregnancy tracking apps since I found out I was pregnant for the first time. Some of them focused on the hundreds of no no’s and awful things that can happen in pregnancy. They really causes me to stress about things I have no control over. Ovia is totally positive and reassuring. The community on there is quick to respond to your concerns and offers support to us over thinkers out there. I love the app and deleted all others!
198,198,5,2020-12-19T01:11:06.000Z,JayMcC707,Super cool app to see your baby grow,"I downloaded this app after using Ovia Fertility. It was so cool to see our little one grow. You can choose the theme so you can see it grow as a vegetable or cute animal, give the baby a name if you already have one, see the size of its hand and feet, and so much more! You make the app work for you by adding as much or as little information as possible. I loved the mood tracker, the different articles to read, and how the baby may look in an ultrasound!"
199,199,4,2020-12-27T14:53:02.000Z,HappyTeaxh,"Great info, easy to use, highly interactive","I used the other Ovia app tracking my period and trying to conceive. I love how easy it is to use Ovia Pregnancy, and the plethora of information contained in the articles. I’m heavily disappointed how centered it is on breast feeding and natural delivery. Not every woman has those as options - me for example. No app out there that I’ve tried reflects on formula, c-sections, or any other anomalies that anatomy can cause during pregnancy. That being said, the drawings and variety of themes make the app so easy to customize and relate to your growing baby."
200,200,5,2018-05-11T06:02:32.000Z,kchiconaa,Love the app,"This is the first time I’ve ever used Ovia I was using another app but found some of the info on that app to be false or contradicting so I switched over to Ovia. I love it 😊 I started using the app at 9 weeks currently 32 weeks, and if I get pregnant again this will definitely be the app I choose to work with love the weekly updates and daily updates on baby. The videos Gina makes are awesome I feel like everything she says has so much impact on how I see things in my own pregnancy! Love Ovia"
201,201,5,2018-08-31T16:04:56.000Z,Hayleeo,Tried all of the others and love this one! By far my favorite!,"I tried some of the other common apps and they seemed difficult to navigate. I never knew how to get back to where I was or what I was doing. Within the first 20 minutes I could navigate this app so easily. Some of the features I love: you can put in Drs appts on calendar, calendar has the weeks listed, it has food list of what you can and can’t eat. So much more! Definitely recommend."
202,202,5,2019-02-26T01:24:11.000Z,JJVick2015,Great app for tracking pregnancy,"I use this app for two main reasons: to track my symptoms to report to my dr and to track the growth of my baby. For those things, this app is perfect. One thing I’ve kind of liked is reading the weekly overview of typical symptoms and being reassured that I’m not feeling something weird or crazy."
203,203,4,2019-03-30T20:10:30.000Z,Old-Money,👍🏼,"I love this app in terms of all of the information it has to offer about baby development and pregnancy symptoms. I also love the fact that most of the nutrition information and suggestions the app provides is actually pretty accurate and appropriate (As a Registered Dietitian this is important to me). I would probably give 5 stars but the app kept having add like stuff on my timeline and no matter how many times I hit the “hide” button and the “do not show similar items” button, it kept pulling them right back up."
204,204,4,2019-04-18T14:04:23.000Z,DJain,Friendly,"I mostly use the app for the fun fruit analogies that I get every week. I am fortunate that I don’t have too many pregnancy symptoms that I need to track in the area, but I still find this feature helpful particularly to track Maude. I think it is good practice to reflect, at the end of the day, on how I felt during the previous 24 hours. I would recommend this app the other pregnant women, if nothing else for the helpful articles and the fun fruits that I like sending to my family to help them feel involved with my pregnancy."
205,205,4,2019-05-29T02:45:38.000Z,👍🏼😊😬😱,Great App to track baby,"I have used this app with all of my babies, I just like the way it is set up and how it looks etc. Easy to use and make sense. I would give five stars other than the community part of it where people chat. They obviously can’t control people but pregnancy is so hard and emotionally and sooooo many negative people on there commenting, trolling, and picking fights for no real reason. Just get rid of the chat part because people can’t choose to be kind or have any kind of moral standards towards others."
206,206,5,2019-09-27T15:44:50.000Z,stupidfish21,Best pregnancy app I’ve tried.,"This app has been wonderful for me and if I ever decide to have more kids, I will definitely be using this one again. It has been so incredibly helpful to me as a first time mom with all of the articles and the ability to ask questions to other moms in the world. It has some cool features with the guess of how big the baby is, food/med lookup, and the everyday tidbits about the milestone your baby just hit inside the womb. 100% recommend this app."
207,207,5,2021-03-30T21:01:53.000Z,AndreaBonitaLoca❤️,LOVE IT,Oh my god I love this app this app has helped me so much.  I would definitely recommend this app to all pregnant mamas!  I have no hate towards this app at all it is all good thoughts.  What I love most about this app is that all the mamas are all anonymous and we can ask each other questions all the time and help each other out.  This app has things that will make you question shouldn’t you be paying for something like this? But you aren’t and that is what i love about this app.
208,208,5,2020-12-24T18:32:10.000Z,courtneyyh13,Most comprehensive,The second j tested positive I went looking for apps and was so overwhelmed with the options! My first decision was to go with the app that had the most reviews which was WTE. Then I wanted MORE. I downloaded more apps and have decided this app has the MOST info which is obviously what I want. Some apps have daily updates and how big is the baby but this app has WAY more. If you’re looking and aren’t sure just download it and try it out to see which one you like 😊
209,209,5,2020-12-03T21:15:47.000Z,Camtyluvr83,Extremely helpful,"Great local connections! They hooked me up with a gestational diabetes study at Mass General that not only paid me, free daycare, snacks, and parking. They also didn’t go through insurance. They sent test results to my doctors."
210,210,4,2018-02-10T13:23:41.000Z,MeliBaby102,Great app for pregnancy,This was one of the first apps I installed when I found out I was pregnant again. Loveee all the wonderful info as well as the information given specifically tailored to your needs. The photos and ultrasounds really helped me understand what is happening in my body. And I loveeeee the forum to post questions and no one knows who you really are. It’s a great way to ask all those embarrassing questions without being judged.
211,211,2,2018-02-20T05:53:35.000Z,Remey24,Annoying since the update,I have been religiously updating my info to track my pregnancy daily. I love reading the articles and learning as much as I can.
212,212,2,2018-04-24T19:17:29.000Z,Alexis_88,Boring,Boring in comparison to Glow. I enjoyed the fertility app so I thought I would enjoy this one. The community feature gets annoying it’s very limiting. Unlike glow I can’t choose which groups I want to hear from so then in my inbox I see a variety of questions and comments I’m just not interested in. With Glow I can choose which group of moms I want to read about like same due date as me or having same marital questions.
213,213,4,2018-06-06T03:47:04.000Z,Sugarchild108,Love it!!! But...,I absolutely love the daily updates I love al the features and the different weekly size options. My all time number one app and resource for my pregnancy! The only issue I have is that the estimated baby size according to this app seems to be smaller than every other website and app that exists. I’d like to reply entirely on this app but also want to make sure the information is as accurate as can be.
214,214,5,2021-03-12T05:07:08.000Z,emp0204,Best pregnancy tracking app!,"I was using Flo app when I first got pregnant but after more research I saw that this one was highly recommended and I can see why! They have everything you need to track including moods, kicks, symptoms. They even have somewhere to look up your symptoms in case you’re worried about something. Another plus is that you can connect with other expecting moms by asking or answering questions. Would definitely recommend."
215,215,5,2021-03-30T19:25:40.000Z,Jess_boyd_,Best pregnancy app for me!,"I have 4 pregnancy apps total and Ovia is the one I use the most. It’s the most user friendly to me and has the best layouts and features. It does have some advertising but not overly so like others. I love the size comparisons and that you can change the themes! The calendar is loaded with features for you to track symptoms, weight and vitals. You can keep notes and add pictures for memories. I use this app for everything!! I highly recommend!"
216,216,4,2020-03-16T19:52:20.000Z,dkdjendidkw,Wonderful app,I’ve really enjoyed this app and all the different features on it. The community question tab is wonderful to use and also gives encouragement so you’re not alone in crazy symptoms or questions!
217,217,2,2019-09-06T15:16:15.000Z,RNStolenFrom10816,Owned by pharma,"This app can be helpful in some ways but when almost everyday there is an add for some type of medication (usually for depression) and then it’s giving false information in your rights as a patient (using the word WILL for procedures that are optional). This is not ok to instill this inaccurate information into, what is probably a first time moms, head and make her feel pressured to give away her rights. Also it assumes you only have an option of a hospital birth which isn’t true at all. There are birth centers and home births options available."
218,218,5,2021-03-10T23:55:58.000Z,PurpleLove17,Loved it!!,"I loved using this app during my pregnancy, and I actually cried when I had to delete it! It helped me with articles, and made me feel excited about my growing baby! I loved being able to count down the days and learn about how she was growing. The community section answered my questions and gave me a fun place to hear other moms and their concerns/ideas. I recommend this app to absolutely everyone who is pregnant! Can’t wait to download it again!! :)"
219,219,5,2020-12-03T21:40:43.000Z,bai.songshu,Easy to use with fun facts!,I loved using the app while I was pregnant and now that my little one is here I use their parenting app! The info included (medication and food safety lookups and quick articles relevant to where you’re at along the pregnancy) and fun facts such as comparing the size of baby to animals/produce/toys depending on your preference were great and not too long winded. I appreciated that they include references at the bottom of each article to show where the info came from too!
220,220,5,2018-01-02T03:27:40.000Z,Lenabee4332344,Best Pregnancy App,"It's my first pregnancy, so I tried several apps and this once has hands down been the best. I've been using it for about a month now and love it! It's user friendly and has a great layout. It gives you some comfort in knowing some of the things going on are ""normal"" and gives you a great community where you get to ask questions and interact with moms to be, which is great in the early stages (especially if you haven't told many people)."
221,221,5,2018-01-02T12:34:49.000Z,Rebekann,Love!,"I’m on my second pregnancy using this app and I love it. I love how informative it is, how it reminds you to take/do certain things. Love seeing the size of baby week to week. Using the calendar aspect to track dr apts and various things."
222,222,5,2018-01-19T07:49:47.000Z,FitnessBarbie564,Themes,"My SIL suggested this app to me since this is my first pregnancy. I already had found 3 pregnancy apps that I preferred, but I went ahead and installed this app just to say I tried it. When I actually gave it a chance, it became my favorite app. I LOVE the feature that allows you to change the theme and choose how to compare growth of your baby. To me, fruits and vegetable sizes are vague as they can vary so much.. so comparing size to animals makes it more relatable. Please don't change anything :)"
223,223,5,2020-11-19T20:08:51.000Z,kyky112120,The absolute best,Before I got pregnant I was using the Ovia app to track my ovulation and that app was extremely helpful and four months down the road I was pregnant! So from the moment I found out I have completely enjoyed using this app. I really love the information that’s being provided and most importantly the community feature. I love being able to share with women my experience and vice versa. This app is a must it truly made my pregnancy journey a spectacular one. ❤️
224,224,5,2020-07-20T11:33:04.000Z,subpargoku,Do it.,"First time mother here. This app is great for keeping you in the know- especially during these odd times. Things they said at the doctor that you maybe forgot about? It’s there as a reminder. Things they didn't mention at the doctor? There. Things that maybe happen before you make it to your next appointment? Also there. Helpful articles within the app, and all information cited. Definitely would recommend."
225,225,5,2020-12-18T10:42:50.000Z,dsaenesouk,My pregnancies,I used this app for all three of my pregnancies. It was pretty cool and I learned some things here and there. Help me keep track of a lot of things from weeks/months. Medication. Things that might happen and just be aware of. What I really liked was reminders of what medications I couldn’t take. I would be forgetful about that. Definitely learn the app and take advantage of it. It’s very useful and would recommend especially to new soon to be mothers.
226,226,4,2021-03-26T14:59:06.000Z,bonniewaller,Easy and Simple,"I used Ovia Fertility and now I’m on to this version. It’s extremely user friendly with lots of tips and tricks to manage a healthy pregnancy. The information is helpful in tracking baby’s growth, however, I wish it were a little more complex in hat development was taking place and had some more detailed pictures. But overall it’s great, especially for non medical people. I also really enjoy the safe food look up; it gives rationales for whether food is safe or not which is super helpful."
227,227,4,2020-11-26T09:33:14.000Z,ysn rstm,Help,So I’ve been using this app for the past 6 months and I’ve loved it so far but a few days ago when I opened the app it had logged out of my account so i tried to log in again but it kept saying invalid email address or password. I was sure about my email address so I thought that I forgot my password so I clicked forgot password and it emailed me that theres no account with this email address! And when i tried to make a new account it kept saying session expired. Its been 4 days guys
228,228,5,2021-01-18T04:49:25.000Z,JacquelyneNicole,By far the BEST pregnancy app!,"Love. Love. Love! Everything about this app is great! Tons of useful information, tips and fun facts - great for knowing how your growing baby is developing and how your body is changing. It tracks not only your trimester and weeks (with a countdown), but also has trends for your weight gain, sleeping habits and much more. The food safety section is great for those who love a wide variety of foods, but maybe haven’t had to think about how it could affect baby. Can’t say enough good things!"
229,229,5,2020-04-23T13:11:46.000Z,Kvy1123,Best pregnancy app ever,"I’m now 38 weeks pregnant and have used this app throughout my WHOLE pregnancy.. every symptom I’ve experienced during pregnancy was accurate in the descriptions they’d give you every week and they’d constantly remind me to take my prenatals, you can also anonymously ask questions to other expecting or second time mothers for their opinions or experiences as well!!! definitely still using this app after my pregnancy and again on my next. I LOVE IT!"
230,230,5,2018-01-04T11:02:35.000Z,Courtmariek,You can put your worries to rest with this app,This is my first ever pregnancy. I don’t know a lot of what’s normal and what’s not. This app is simply amazing! It lets you look up medication to see if it’s safe to take while pregnant. And what foods to eat. Let’s you look up symptoms and reassures you that they are normal. Helps you record questions to ask the doctors and due dates. has a forum so you can talk to other women about their experiences too. Definitely give this app 5 stars!
231,231,5,2018-07-22T04:56:20.000Z,Rosie 0710,From Ovia fertility to ovia pregnancy,I was using ovia fertility to track my period as well as my temperature so I could tell when I was ovulating and when I wasn’t...I finally logged my daily stat and the app told me to take a pregnancy test which I did I was pregnant. I then transferred to ovia pregnancy and so far it’s been a marvelous app with helping me to keep track of everything...I’m almost at the finishing line just 4 more weeks to go and I’m very pleased with this app. Highly recommendable.
232,232,5,2018-09-12T05:05:31.000Z,Alexandra215,Love it!,"Honestly I had a stressful pregnancy and this app gave me something to look forward to every week. I looked forward to the information they provided about the growth, I loved the pictures, I loved guessing and being surprised by what kind of “food” or “unique animal” his size was referenced to, the community of women asking each other questions and supporting each other. I had added a few apps but this one was the winner. Definitely recommend"
233,233,5,2018-12-28T16:09:47.000Z,Charideehope,Such a blessing!,"I had a couple friends who used Ovia for their pregnancies and I thought I would give it a try when I found out I was pregnant. It’s our first baby, so it’s been soooo cool seeing the developments each week, with the neat little graphics and size comparisons. I look forward to each week seeing what the next stage of development will be for my lil Munchkin! It’s also full of insiders and tips. Very useful, I open the app every day, several times a day! I ❤️ Ovia!"
234,234,4,2019-04-22T15:56:18.000Z,round2 momma,My favorite app,"I love this app. I used it with my first pregnancy and it was so helpful in knowing and understanding what was happening. They thought of almost everything when creating the app. Kick counter, contraction timer, notes and milestones, a place for appointments, educational articles and videos. The only thing I would change about the app is to add a birth plan creator. I had to download a separate app for creating my birth plan which is no big deal. But it would be nice to keep everything together in one app. I love it!"
235,235,3,2019-12-24T14:44:34.000Z,amandanko,Almost perfect,"I have been juggling popular pregnancy apps for weeks - all missing something. Except Ovia! Everything you need is in the one app, without the extra fluff, easy to access. The only thing keeping this from being our *only* pregnancy app is the fact that the health data is write-only - the app does not read from your phone. That means if you want to track your activity, steps, weight, nutrition, etc then you need to manually enter these daily (no thanks). Download the app, you will love it, just realize you’ll need something extra."
236,236,2,2021-05-11T02:53:23.000Z,RobertoLuis2,Not great,Feed is very spammy. They ask me the same questions over and over. Lots of ads.
237,237,4,2020-06-02T18:29:17.000Z,Humantv1239,Nutrition tracker,The nutrition tracker can be improved a great deal. I would like to scan the barcodes and adjust the serving sizes of different food items to see if I am fulfilling my daily prenatal nutrition requirements & maintaining an healthy diet. There is currently no app that provides this support to the pregnant population. This would be a great update. Everything can be done on 1 app.. also providing daily recommended exercise routine would be ideal. I just find it easier to use 1 app vs several when striving to optimize my prenatal experience.
238,238,5,2021-03-14T04:29:35.000Z,Jennyl3igh,Informative and exciting!,"I had the app with my firstborn 6 years ago, and loved it then. I looked forward to his new developments each week and it was one of the highlights of my pregnancy. Now with my second, the updates have improved the experience even more and you can personalize it further to your preference which I like! Still look forward to those weekly developments and information. A must have for all momma’s."
239,239,4,2020-08-02T02:09:34.000Z,movingmtns,Pretty Great Overall,I originally downloaded 3 apps and Ovia quickly became my preferred app because of the UI. Its super easy to use and the layout makes sense. I like how you can remove sections you don’t want to track to keep a clean tracker.
240,240,5,2018-02-22T19:05:13.000Z,MamiVillegas,Best Pregnancy App I’ve Used,"If you’re struggling to find the right pregnancy app look no further! Ovia is awesome. I highly recommend it to new moms and moms who have been at it awhile. This is my second pregnancy and I have found this app to be extremely helpful and easy to use. I’m able to keep up with my weight, nutrition, blood pressure and more so I know what to bring up at my doctors appointments. Ovia has a great community of friendly people. Just a great app overall."
241,241,4,2018-05-24T13:17:50.000Z,EConant,"I love this app, but it could be more helpful in later pregnancy!","In the beginning, I found this app so helpful to discuss common symptoms of pregnancy and how the baby was changing weekly. By the end of pregnancy, there is less changing happening physically, and I wished the weekly updates were more informative regarding thinking about life after pregnancy - including topics like breastfeeding or sleep training. As a mom who is currently overdue, I bet many overdue moms would be happy if the app continued providing a bit of distraction in the final weeks!"
242,242,5,2018-06-05T06:23:34.000Z,Mrs Wheelington,Amazing 😍,"My fiancé and I LOVE reading about all the things our baby girl is doing on a daily basis!!! She’s my second child and his first so we are so happy to have found an app that keeps us up to speed on not only everything she’s accomplishing inside of me, but all the advice for both of us and the resources. This app is amazing and I would give it 10 stars if I could! I definitely recommend Ovia for tracking your cycle, fertility, pregnancy, and parenting advice!"
243,243,5,2018-09-11T18:17:23.000Z,@ndg,My favorite pregnancy app!,"When I found out I was pregnant , I wanted to know as much as I can. I tried various apps but this one was my favorite because you get new information everyday and every week your baby will be a different kind of fruit or whatever you choose for it to be. Needless to say I always recommend this app to new moms or even second time moms it will make you feel better each day with new fun information."
244,244,5,2019-06-03T22:52:10.000Z,Kat.Nicole,Great app that does it all.,"I used the Ovia fertility app first which was also great. This app can help you track a your appointments, health, baby development. It has great articles, recipes, tips, and weekly videos and updates. My friends and family love when I share the notifications about my baby’s growth from Ovia. I feel so supported from this app and I also got free samples of diapers, wipes, and baby clothes through Ovia. They also helped me get my registry started. Thanks Ovia."
245,245,5,2020-03-16T18:09:59.000Z,Pip0428,So neat!,"I have loved using this app during my pregnancy! It has been so fun to learn how my little one is growing each day and week, and it’s neat to have items/animals to compare his size to! The app is full of helpful tips, articles, videos, and more! You can track your health, including weight, food, mood, and more. Even keep track of appointments and it comes with reminders to take your prenatals! A great app I will use in future pregnancies I am sure! :)"
246,246,1,2020-12-19T14:34:37.000Z,Prix Cruz,Stop the torture,"I downloaded your app when I learned I was pregnant. Shortly after I miscarried and I deleted the pregnancy from the log. Somehow you continued to “monitor” the pregnancy I lost and continued to send me emails. I entered numerous times on the app to make sure it was deleted and there showed no pregnancy, but I still continued to receive the emails."
247,247,5,2019-11-19T11:56:55.000Z,Hdarujbcs,Used daily,This was one app I would open first thing in the morning to see what new things are going on with my baby. I loved this app so much. After this last update it just freezes and won’t load anything or let me log anything. I would love to be able to continue using this app for my remainder of 8 weeks. Please fix this issue!!
248,248,5,2019-08-05T18:20:08.000Z,AAHH55221133,I love this app!,I would highly recommend this app! This is my second pregnancy and I used this app throughout my first as well and it has helped answer so many of my questions. I especially love the food safety lookup section to help me quickly check on whether or not something is safe to eat. I have tried other apps and they have tons of advertisements and are not as clean and easy to surf through as Ovia. So grateful for this app!
249,249,2,2019-11-05T18:27:44.000Z,scaird,Better pregnancy apps are out there,"Now that I’ve used a couple different pregnancy/parenting apps, Ovia has fallen to the bottom of my list as far as quality goes. I used Ovia with my first pregnancy, but with subsequent ones I’ve switched to apps that include both pregnancy and parenting support, so it’s a one stop shop for all my kids. Also I HATED the community forum. Women were so mean and petty, and most of the questions I tried to post didn’t receive any feedback. Comments frequently were deleted and the forum was not monitored well at all. Too much toxicity for such a joyful time of life. Better apps are out there."
250,250,5,2018-01-20T18:05:02.000Z,radtechmamma,I love this app!!!,"This app is the first one I open on a daily basis! I love that it also emails my husband the daily tidbits...this is his first baby and he has been so excited to be involved and learn about his developing baby boy! There’s so much good information, advice, recipes, data tracking! I absolutely love using it above any other app! I also use the Ovia period tracker when not pregnant and haven’t used any other app but that one as well! Ovia is fabulous! Thank you!"
251,251,4,2018-02-21T00:22:11.000Z,Jlwiggy,Can we just lay off the sex articles (pun intended),"I do like this app. However, there are like 2 articles a week about how pregnant woman WANT to have sex and SHOULD have sex. I'm 99% sure the web developer is a guy with a pregnant wife. A healthy sex life is important...but when I'm sitting here feeling like a whale and newsflash DO NOT want to have sex I don't want to see yet another article with a pic of a perky prego girl being all sexy with some title about how I should be doing the same. I can't be alone in this! Lay off the ""have sex"" posts!"
252,252,5,2018-07-10T08:50:46.000Z,Enjae,Data Driven,"When I found out I was pregnant I researched the top apps and downloaded them all. Ovia is by far the best I’ve seen. I love the weekly and daily updates, but most of all I love the ability to track everything from nutrition to symptoms. It makes it so much easier when my doctor asks how I’ve been feeling because I can go in and provide an accurate answer, and not just one based on how I’m feeling in that moment."
253,253,5,2018-07-25T13:53:45.000Z,theaanne04,Beats out “what to expect” and “the bump”,Currently 37 weeks pregnant and have been using Ovia since I found out at 5 weeks. I absolutely love it! I check it multiple times a day and love all the information is gives me about my pregnancy/baby. The message boards are a little weird because anyone can go in and ask a question and there are some weird questions that people have. But overall my favorite pregnancy app.
254,254,4,2018-07-30T06:06:25.000Z,louise6659,Best pregnancy tracking app,"I tried a few other apps. The only other app that comes close to this one is the app Nuture(only because it lets me log how much water I drink everyday, if I took my vitamins, my weight, how I feel, etc) but with this app You can pick the theme to see how big your baby is and you can Ask questions and other moms will answer then and there, there are places to put in your doctors appointments and there a place for your ultrasound pictures and for belly pictures"
255,255,5,2018-08-16T11:47:38.000Z,Squareg4rden,Great!,"I wish I used this app for my first pregnancy! I feel like this one provides more information about baby and me that isn’t all cutesy. I also appreciate being able to customize aspects, like something other than fruits and veggies for baby’s size. I think my only “complaint” would be that I would prefer seeing babies size relative to the womb- at a certain point, all the baby illustrations look the same."
256,256,5,2018-09-26T10:50:17.000Z,MyvisionC,Favorite App,I used other apps with previous pregnancy but this one surpasses all of them. I love how I can click on my mood for the day if I walked if I am feeling love and get advice on it daily. There are many more choices but this is just a few. I love all the articles. I can sign up to get a free breast pump through my insurance right through the app. I can take pictures of my progress. There is a lot I can do and information I can get. I love it.
257,257,5,2019-06-22T14:54:50.000Z,Jess Becomes a Mom,Perfect for the first-time mom!,"I’m into my second trimester & this app has been with me every step of the way. My husband and I look forward to the weekly progress reports that are well informative and fun to read! It’s hard to imagine what is happening inside me and this app brings it to life & imagination. It answers almost all my questions about body changes, nutrition, safe practices & more! I highly recommend this app for first-time mom’s to be!"
258,258,5,2021-01-12T02:13:52.000Z,FanGirl826,So informational,"I was so afraid of the lack of knowledge I had about pregnancy when I found out I was expecting. After one day of using Ovia pregnancy, I was fully confident in my ability to know what’s happening each and everyday throughout my pregnancy! There are so many resources available and it has been so helpful to both me and my husband. I love all the articles, tips, nutrition info, baby development info, personalization, and the community forum!"
259,259,5,2019-10-09T04:22:29.000Z,berzz47,Wonderful app,This is the best pregnancy app out there! There is always so much good information each week about how baby is growing. During the week there is lots of good research-based articles to give you more information about your health and baby’s as well as things to think about during the 9 month process. I’ve used this app with both pregnancies and always recommend it to all my expecting friends!
260,260,5,2017-12-24T13:16:03.000Z,Collibeth,Great app,"App is great with telling you what's up with baby and what you might be experiencing. The personalizations are fun. Minor things for downsides: I do wish it would tell me more about the physical changes in my body (uterus size, position, what is moving to make room for baby, etc.) Also, I hate the daily question if I took my prenatal vitamins . Yes, yes I am. Stop it. Lol. Finally, add Reproductive Endocrinologist to the types of doctors we see."
261,261,3,2018-01-26T04:56:43.000Z,Jay Skin,Half good and half utterly frustrating,This app is not easy to navigate and you have to look up an re enter your meds individually on a daily basis. It’s ridiculous the meds aren’t remembered to be clicked on in the main menu. As well there’s a lot of info I can’t get to because I am not working right now so I have no employer to add in and “authorize” me to use the full app. Nor do I want to input all of my doctors info so that’s cut off too. It’s use is very very limited. I may wind up switching apps. I used the fertility app by Ovia and liked it a lot. This one is a mess
262,262,5,2018-07-20T07:49:10.000Z,BreeThorn,"Reliable, fun app!","This is my second pregnancy, and my second time using Ovia. I use it in conjunction with Glow and I love them both!"
263,263,5,2019-01-27T18:39:12.000Z,quillgreen,Love it,I love this app and I’m learning so much about my pregnancy! It’s fun seeing what fruit or vegetable the baby is and getting all the tips and information as I progress through my pregnancy. We had a loss in August and were only intimate twice before I quickly
264,264,3,2020-01-13T16:44:37.000Z,gianna bowen smith,Obsessed with depression,"This app is ok, but it is CONSTANTLY asking me if I’m depressed or showing me articles about post partum depression. I’ve never been so happy in my entire life so it’s kind of a bummer every time I open the app. It makes me feel like this app is not at all in sync with how my pregnancy is going. Maybe it was created by an antidepressant medicine company or something haha."
265,265,2,2019-09-20T23:33:17.000Z,Stopeatingcars,Way too much c-section content,"Overall I like this app, but I feel like I see so much information about c-sections every single day. I get that is the reality for a lot of women, but for someone who is hoping for a vaginal birth, it’s discouraging to be inundated with it everyday. I wish there were a feature to opt into the type of content you’d like to see based on your birth preferences because the constant c-section articles and information make me not want to log into the app to see updates on baby’s development. I’ve seen four c-section articles in the last three days. Ovia needs to diversify their content."
266,266,5,2021-04-29T19:13:03.000Z,Brittletwig,Best app I’ve used so far!,"The one thing I wish it could do was reminders. I would like the option to set a daily reminder to take prenatal vitamins! It could pop up on my smart phone, and once I’ve taken it, I can dismiss it. I’ve been using the fertility tracking app for many years, I used the pregnancy app for my first child, and I’m using it again now. I highly, highly recommend this app to all pregnant mothers!"
267,267,4,2021-08-18T17:14:39.000Z,k.m.72818,Good overall,I like the app overall and that it gives me daily updates. I wish that the language in it wouldn’t flip back and forth between using him and her for the baby. I think using a neutral “they” would be a lot better.
268,268,5,2021-01-26T12:48:13.000Z,Harley641,Great app with amazing tips and updates,This app is super helpful in providing information about growing babies and what kind of milestones they are making every step of the way. It also suggests helpful articles related to during and post pregnancy and answers questions you didn’t even realize you had. I love the way it compares babies size to different items and let’s you see how far you’ve come.
269,269,5,2021-01-22T22:32:12.000Z,Pleased Momma-to-Be,Lots of useful information for expecting mommas!,One of my favorite things about the app is it gives you fun updates about changes to your body and your baby at least once a day! Each time I refresh the app I learn something new and exciting which makes the process more delightful! I also appreciate the detailed articles and helpful reminders within the app. Great resource for first time mothers!
270,270,5,2017-11-26T00:10:51.000Z,snbergren,Best pregnancy app!,"I have downloaded and tried 6 pregnancy apps total, and this one is by far my favorite. It has all the features I like in one place, most other app only have a few of the features. I also love the layout, how you can change the settings to personalize  the look. It’s cute, simple, yet has everything you need. It gives helpful and relatable medical updates and tips. Overall I love this app!"
271,271,5,2018-03-04T11:03:31.000Z,Kat_grl,Very informative,"I found this app to be very informative and helpful on what kinds of things I could expect during pregnancy. I have now downloaded all three of the app the ovulation app, the pregnancy app and the parenting app and so far I have liked all three! I also really like the community tab, makes me feel a lot better to hear and see that other women are going through the same things. Overall good app!"
272,272,5,2018-05-12T11:26:58.000Z,Blitzer politzer,Best pregnancy app,"When I was pregnant with my first, I downloaded at least 4 pregnancy apps.  Within just a couple month I had deleted all but this one. I loves the videos each week and the daily updates about how my little babe was developing.  It was exactly the information I craved with all the newness of the experience."
273,273,4,2018-09-27T11:13:34.000Z,MegxMcD,Very Good,"This app could be one of the best. I wish the weekly informative videos would’ve started immediately like another pregnancy app I have. Also, highly annoyed right now about the fact that I have to see the “did you take your prenatal vitamin” pop up every day now!! I was taking my vitamin every day just fine on my own, why are you just now annoying me with this when I’m already halfway through the pregnancy. I keep trying to find a way to disable it!"
274,274,5,2018-10-25T14:58:33.000Z,Swiyyah Zarinah,Best pregnancy app!,"The best pregnancy app there is. Helps you every step of the way, keeps you organized and on track. Ovia is like my portable assistant. I log my doctor appointments, weight gain, food intake, and so much more. They share daily facts about the baby’s growth and what symptoms you should experience week by week. You even see your baby growing in your app just as it would in your tummy. This is my first pregnancy and I am super glad that I  choose Ovia."
275,275,4,2019-05-31T12:53:00.000Z,Girlystar9,Almost 5 Stars,"I just started using this app...I live that it tracks so much information!  I became pregnant through IVF, so I wish that it had more features related to that.  There should either be more medications added, or a way to free type in medications not on the list.  Also, when searching for medications, many are long and get cut-off so you came read all the details.  Overall I do love this app, but wish a few more things could be applicable to my situation."
276,276,5,2020-09-11T23:46:20.000Z,BlackAmigo087,A Must Have,"I absolutely love this app. My wife and I both had it on our phones and it is the best one ever. She has 4 or 5 other apps that I never tried, this was the first one I came across and when I was telling her the things I saw she kept saying, “none of my apps do that” so I knew we had a winner. Very user friendly and a ton of information broken up where it’s not overwhelming. Looking forward to their parenting app"
277,277,5,2020-06-17T03:59:20.000Z,karwsbwbaw,LOVE LOVE LOVE,This is by far the best pregnancy tracker app I have come across! I have tried several and this one gives you the most!! Get daily insights. Get to customize! Really user friendly! I really love the community part too!
278,278,3,2021-01-20T06:10:05.000Z,Feefm,"One pregnancy, not able to add new pregnancy","I am reading this as a three because I did love the app during my first pregnancy. But I am pregnant again and want to add a new profile for my new baby and it had the option for you to select a new pregnancy but it looks as if you need to wipe out all the old information already filled out which is such a bummer because had I known that, I would’ve exported my information first to save it from my first baby. I just can’t believe that you can’t add multiple baby profiles."
279,279,5,2020-04-26T21:20:27.000Z,bery_boop,Favorite out of 3 apps,"Like many others, I used multiple apps when I found out I was expecting. I won’t name the others, but suffice to say, this one beat out the rest. There’s not one thing they’ve left out. From food safety lookup, to symptom lookup, to developmental markers with high level of detail and appointment reminders, photo uploads, notes, medication logging, mood logging and more. I really enjoy using this app. Well done, Ovia!"
280,280,3,2017-11-05T16:38:40.000Z,Yea!88888268951,Fertility tracker is better,I wish this app synced to my Garmin. It is still a good app but I am 5 weeks and it doesn't seem like there is much information for me unless I search for it.
281,281,5,2018-06-19T16:44:12.000Z,riah1deeben2,Love it,I have loved this app ever sense I got it! I started out with the first ovia tracker and then moved onto this one once I got pregnant! I love how it gives you daily and weekly updates as well as the fun availability to customize your app! I love the calendar and how you can keep it updated with what’s going on in your life as well and the baby bump tracker! I definitely think this is one of the best apps you can get! I highly recommend it
282,282,5,2018-09-14T17:09:25.000Z,Queenopop,Love this app,The best pregnancy app out there! Easiest app to maneuver through. If I’m questioning a food but I’m in a bad service area I can just open up the app and it’s always available it gives me piece at mind. And the fact I can talk to other women in the same boat as me and share experiences is just fantastic! I recommend this app to anyone that becomes pregnant! This is my second pregnancy and the app just gets better and better!
283,283,5,2018-12-20T13:18:48.000Z,em0331,Love!,"I tried one other app before this one and couldn’t seem to navigate it, but this app is set up for easy use. My favorite part is seeing the size of my baby every week in comparison to foods haha. More importantly though is all the information you might not think to look up and articles included in your daily feed! It’s my first pregnancy, so I’m far from an expert and this app has helped me a lot !"
284,284,4,2019-02-17T15:21:52.000Z,personal demons 13,I wish it had an option to track multiples,I downloaded the app when my daughter found out she was expecting. Then we found out she was having twins. There isn’t an app to track multiple babies and how they are growing differently than a singleton baby. This is a very informative app and we both share it with friends and family but we know a little later down the road it won’t be as accurate. I’m still very happy with it.
285,285,5,2019-02-25T23:45:03.000Z,mommaryss,Great resource!,"I used the Ovia Fertility app to get pregnant, and we were successful in one month! Once pregnant, I decided to try out the Ovia Pregnancy app, and I love it so far. I really like all the weekly updates about me and baby. I also love the daily developmental updates about baby! Not only that, but it’s so cute that you can pick out various things to detail the stages of baby’s growth, and you get to pick out themes for the app. Overall, I love Ovia so far!"
286,286,1,2019-04-24T02:26:27.000Z,lyoung17,Do not download this family of apps,"Ovia health apps (fertility, pregnancy, and parenting) offers a private version through some employers healthcare plans. They’re then giving these employers full access to sensitive data about women’s health from those that chose to use it. Sensitive, personal data going to your employer about your fertility and private health? No names given, yeah well I’m the only woman in child bearing years at my employer, they’d know real fast."
287,287,5,2021-01-22T22:31:25.000Z,shanaloraine89,Love this,"I love this app, each week I’m given new information about my pregnancy, also love that it has a calendar to keep track of appointments as well as add moods, and milestones, and track everything health wise, like symptoms,  blood pressure, weight, medications, fetal movement, sleep, what I’ve eaten, etc. There is also a contraction timer & kick counter, hospital bag checklist, food safety and medication safety lookup. It’s just a overall very great app to use while pregnant"
288,288,4,2020-04-05T14:14:01.000Z,Rylee Evans,"Great app overall, wish they would tone down the “human like” remarks","Love the app, love that there are daily updates on what is happening with the baby. Very comprehensive and easy to use, I love the four square references at the top, especially the little hands and feet."
289,289,4,2020-08-05T05:58:23.000Z,jennnisunshine,Love the app; needs some work,I used this app for my first pregnancy! I checked it daily and loved the weekly updates about baby and all the cool features. I just downloaded it again for my second pregnancy but I did see anywhere to put in new info. I did the “report birth” thinking maybe that would reset the app but it just told me to download load the parenting app (which is also just as awesome! And the fertility tracker app!!) so can I add a second pregnancy and if I can how?
290,290,5,2017-09-12T14:21:18.000Z,minivan719,Best Pregnancy App Out There!,"This app has been by far my favorite pregnancy app!! It is the first thing I look at on my phone every day! Each week I am so excited to hear about the new developments for my baby and to watch the video of Gina :) It contains relevant  , helpful articles along with several great features such as a food and medication check. I have recommended it to all my pregnant friends and will continue to do so!"
291,291,5,2017-12-23T12:58:28.000Z,Rachel Oliver,Love this app!,"Wayyy better than The Bump & other pregnancy apps out there. I love the section of side effects, medications that are safe/to avoid & food items. This is so helpful & really helped prepare me for my first 8-week appointment. I knew what questions to ask & why I was experiencing side effects without having to ask for the 411. I feel I’m making the best choices when I can look up a food really quick! Love this app!"
292,292,5,2018-10-16T12:11:29.000Z,H_bean,"More scientific, less trying to sell you stuff compared to other apps","I originally had a different pregnancy app but found that they were mostly trying to see you stuff. I like Ovia because of its interface (sort of like a news feed), and I find the articles and features to be more scientific than other apps. It also helps you track symptoms, your health, and appointments."
293,293,5,2018-11-10T19:14:26.000Z,kaleighstarshine,"Wonderful, informative","Lots of learning about our little bundle of joy on the way with Ovia! I loved using their fertility tracker and when we found out we were expecting, I started using the pregnancy app. I love it. It helps me keep up with my health and my weight, while giving me a place to store my data on the pregnancy. I don’t use all of the features, but there are so many. And I love the literature we get daily too!"
294,294,4,2019-06-04T11:56:38.000Z,obrien_shan,4/5,Love everything about this app!
295,295,5,2021-01-26T13:11:14.000Z,T8RTOTPHILLIPS,Little blueberry,Love that Ovia has suggestions for symptoms that you/we may be feeling and going thorough. It sends you little reminders that you’re doing a good job or that we are beautiful. Some things are just a little wink to make you feel better. You can customize the layout and pick the references to the size of your baby as it grows! I chose fruits and vegetables. Have fun keeping an eye on your little blueberry!

298,298,3,2021-03-18T10:15:59.000Z,calibelle2,Starting to get annoyed,"I really like this app, but I’m getting VERY SICK of it constantly logging me out instead of keeping me logged in all the time. There’s not any other apps where I have to log in every 2 weeks when I’m using it daily. Personal information being on the app is no excuse, as I can stay logged into Facebook/Instagram/or other pregnancy apps endlessly without ever having to log back in. ALSO, there’s no way to track twin pregnancies on here and in 2021 I cannot believe a coder hasn’t figured that out yet."
299,299,5,2020-12-30T00:14:04.000Z,Lyndsey13,Loved this App!,"I trusted in the app throughout my pregnancy more than I can even begin to express. It was so helpful for a first time mom like me. Thankfully, my insurance covered the app for the premium version but even if it didn’t I would buy it myself. The updates are so helpful as well as the Ovia coaches! I do love that there is a kick timer, contraction timer, hospital bag checklist, and even a good & medication safety lookup. Seriously just loved this app so much!"

301,301,4,2018-07-10T12:47:01.000Z,mystiraynes,Needs a few fixes,"On iPhone, I have to screen shot things in order to share them. If I click the share button, it doesn’t send the person what I’m trying to share, it sends them a link to download the app."
302,302,5,2018-07-31T11:40:02.000Z,$ondr@77,Awesome,This app has been perfect for me when trying to conceive as well as during pregnancy.   It has provided such valuable support through the message board/community feature and I look forward each week to find out which new item the baby is similar in size to.  All the fun facts and info that show up on the news feed encourage you to keep tracking data.  I love it .
303,303,5,2018-08-06T02:17:55.000Z,ally.nicole,Ovia comparison,"I have a lot of pregnancy apps I have Flo, What to Expect, Pregnancy+, and Ovia. Ovia by far is the best one I have on my phone. I love the little updates each day, and how it lets you customize everything to your specific pregnancy. There is only one other app that lets you specify the gender, which in my opinion they should all allow you to put the gender on there so you feel it’s actually talking about your baby."
304,304,5,2018-09-04T00:46:12.000Z,BlackDiamynd (storm8id),Love it!,"Ovia was recommended to me by a close friend of mine. It’s a great app! It puts your baby’s development and growth into perspective, it is a place where you can keep track of all of your feelings/thoughts, activity, weight, sleep, and symptoms. It gives information on each aspect of pregnancy (pre, during, and post).... it even allows you to share your recorded information with loved ones! It’s a great app all the way around!"
305,305,4,2018-10-10T12:50:18.000Z,Mexi Shriver,Neat features,"I have enjoyed this app and out of all the apps I enjoy this one the most because you can change  the types of approximate size your baby is. From a fruit to a toy to and animal or even a pastry. It gives you a good idea of what to expect. My other favorite part was seeing her little hands and feet. Overall, the information provided is really great and I have learned a thing or two after being on my 4th child. Currently, 34 weeks along."
306,306,4,2019-04-26T11:35:29.000Z,AMS29414,Fun and informative,"I have really enjoyed this app for providing helpful information, as well as fun facts. However, once I hit 36 weeks, I stopped using it as much because I found out my baby girl was breech. There hasn’t been any information about breech presentation on the app and it is not available in the “special conditions” and not a whole lot of information about planned c-sections. So I’ve relied on other pregnancy apps and general web for helpful information about breech babies."
307,307,2,2020-09-30T15:27:47.000Z,kate_h01,Tracking is limited and can’t delete notes,"The app is good for tracking though I would prefer to have more options to be able to track like when I had sex, if i experienced any spotting or bleeding or other discharges... I just feel like it’s very limiting. And slowwwwww.  Also every time I type something in the notes section and need to go back to change it or add to it, the app won’t let me add characters even if it’s not full and I can’t delete any. I’ve tried deleting and Re-installing the app and that hasn’t helped either. Also, too many ads!"
308,308,1,2020-01-17T18:57:18.000Z,KayoKaye,Cannot sign up OR sign in,"I attempted to download one Ovia app and it kept giving me the same error, “Failed to process” or some crap like that so I attempted to do it through Facebook which seems to be working up to the point that I hit “Continue” on Facebook then it just brought me back to the sign in page!!!!! Over and over again, this eventually led to me giving up and providing THIS feedback that these apps are trash until they fix that. Same thing happened with the pregnancy tracker app."
309,309,1,2019-09-07T22:30:18.000Z,aligrace123,Just no.,"If you try for a long time to get pregnant I would not go with this app. The way the lady in the videos talks about the weeks of pregnancy was very discouraging to me. I also feel like they point out what could go wrong more than they talk about the great things your baby is doing at this time. She also mentions that 23 weeks is too early to buy baby stuff? Everyone has their own option but I just found this app very discouraging and overbearing. Also the sizes are off some weeks. If you’re wanting a positive pregnancy app that will not having you worry about things you shouldn’t be, this friends is not for you."
310,310,5,2017-09-27T23:23:36.000Z,UGAgirl06,Great Ap!!!,I used this ap my entire pregnancy. I loved seeing the articles along the way and never felt overwhelmed with all the information that is out there. They hit the key things you would need to know about. I loved hearing what to expect each week during pregnancy as well so I knew what could be coming and it helped to confirm certain symptoms were normal. Great ap and I would highly recommend it!
311,311,5,2017-12-13T20:57:12.000Z,hailzmarch,Fun and informative,"This app was by far my favorite during my pregnancy. I downloaded several that were recommended by friends but this one seemed so much more personalized. I would look forward to opening the app every morning, especially at the start of a new week. I also tracked all of my doctor appointments through the calendar. If we ever go for baby #3, I’ll definitely download again."
312,312,3,2018-01-05T19:02:47.000Z,Cheerchic_1405,When will there be an app for multiples?!?!,"This app isn't bad. I've used ones in the past that offer wayyyy more insight but overall, it's a decent app. What disappoints me though is that there truly isn't a single app on the market either directed at women with multiples or at LEAST with the ability to customize for multiples within the app. I was hopeful that this would be the app for me since I liked the ovulation app but sadly, this one is no different from all the others. This twin momma would LOVE an app that acknowledged more than one baby!!!"
313,313,5,2018-01-31T23:02:51.000Z,Hapalove4u,Fun and informative,"Not only did I learn a lot about what to expect throughout the pregnancy, there are recipes, and cute pictures that kept me entertained to see how big the baby was getting. I liked being able to track my weight. There were so many other things I could also track, but I didn’t find it needed for my pregnancy. I recommend this app for first time and any pregnant moms."
314,314,3,2019-02-01T17:32:14.000Z,rainbowboymama,Ovia App,It’s a good app for simple things. It unfortunately limits you if you don’t use healthcare with a provider from your employer. I have a personal health insurance and I’m limited on resources to learn new things or explore the app. It doesn’t accept my health insurance because it’s not through my employer.
315,315,4,2019-02-14T02:42:59.000Z,thekaitlingrace,Mostly love!,"I love this app! However, I’d like to suggest they add the option to track a second pregnancy without sacrificing the tracking of the first. I’m now pregnant with our second child and I like referring back to my first pregnancy for week to week comparisons. However, the week tracker goes away when you add a new pregnancy. I wish I could see both! I used this app on a daily basis throughout my entire first pregnancy. I’ll likely be doing the same again!"
316,316,4,2019-03-14T06:45:34.000Z,Ashone8806,Love the UX,"I downloaded a few apps and this is the one I use by far the most! There isn’t ads constantly trying to sell me baby products, I love that you can customize the look to an extent, and the information is easily digestible during a pretty crazy time! The only reason I only gave it 4/5 was because sometimes I wish there was more!! I am still early on, so this could change, but I even made my husband download this...it’s great!"
317,317,5,2019-05-04T15:02:29.000Z,Zombinaape,My most favorite pregnancy app!,"The functionality of this app is definitely my most favorite. Easy to use, beautiful layouts, and I just LOVE Gina’s weekly videos. She’s super down to earth and easy to listen to as she provides exciting tidbits of information for the week ahead. Wish I would’ve had this with my first, but am so thankful to use it with my second! I highly recommend this app to every preggo I know. Thanks, Ovia."
318,318,5,2019-09-12T01:09:02.000Z,SK1720,Easy to Use!,"I have tried several pregnancy apps throughout my pregnancy and Ovia is by far my favorite. It is easy to use, provides reminders to take vitamins daily, and provides insightful information daily. Other apps only seem to update the reading materials weekly, which is fine, but I really enjoyed being able to learn more about my baby’s development and my pregnancy every day."
319,319,3,2020-12-26T05:03:26.000Z,sudass10,Help!,"I’m so frustrated with this app at the moment. I have used this app since 2016 for three pregnancies, i got signed out somehow this last week and now it will not let me even attempt to login. It keeps saying my device does not meet ovia health high security standards. So bummed as I am at the end of my pregnancy and use this app to track kick counts, contractions, apts. In addition I’m active on the community chat. I’m keeping my fingers crossed I will be able to access app in the next few days, if not I suppose I’ll be finding a new one. 😔"
320,320,3,2017-09-26T05:28:01.000Z,Ashwdwrd,With some updates could be great,I am 22 weeks as of this review and have been using this app since week 4 (and from week 5-9 in previous pregnancy ending in miscarriage)
321,321,3,2018-01-22T17:37:10.000Z,zannah2k,Sometimes iffy.,I’ve found this app incredibly useful for tracking my general health and feelings. It lets me save questions and notes. I enjoy the milestones and usually the community.
322,322,5,2018-03-03T08:44:10.000Z,Jmiller42171,BEST APP EVER!! LIFESAVER!!!,"This is the best app ever invented!!! There have been so many times I almost went over the edge with my worry & concern over my growing baby, but have no fear Ovia is here!!! It is beyond accurate, every single week was spot-on, so eerily accurate I even cried watching Gina's videos bc I knew everything I was experiencing was perfectly normal! I LOVE OVIA!!! I recommend to every pregnant/expecting mother or any woman even WANTING to become a mother just to prepare her for the journey! 😘😘😘"
323,323,5,2018-06-10T14:13:15.000Z,newmomma2018,I love this app,I love the Ovia App! I used the fertility tracking app and was pregnant after 3 months of trying! It was so helpful and had lots of useful tips to guide me through the process. Now I am 14 weeks pregnant and it is great for tracking my pregnancy. It’s very informative and I love the daily updates versus some apps that will only give you weekly updates on your progress. I would recommended this series of apps to anyone.
324,324,5,2018-07-12T05:31:30.000Z,GunerGirl308,Love it!!!!,"Pregnant with my second baby and I wanted to learn more about my baby. I didn’t keep track with my first and I wanted to know more about the baby’s progress and I saw this app and thought I would give it a try. I love it! Easy to use and haven’t had any problems with the app, I will definitely be using it with future pregnancies and I can’t wait to try out the other apps they have ."
325,325,5,2018-07-17T14:43:33.000Z,PaintedLily,Wonderfully Thoughtful App,"This app is just amazing! It has an incredible amount of helpful information and so many different logs and features. Development information, food lists (even with lesser known items like geitost cheese), nutrition logs, calendar for appointments, emotional and physical check-ins, baby bump photos...so much! The interface is pretty and easy to navigate and they let you customize it to a degree. It’s just awesome and I love it!"
326,326,3,2018-07-27T13:03:56.000Z,mom of 3 under 2,1 baby=5 starts.     2 babies=2 stars😧,So with my first pregnancy it was a just 1 baby and I absolutely loved the app and everything it had to offer and all of the daily information it provided. However I am pregnant again with twins and the app is a disappointment! Still get the updates but it does not provide any info for twins and I have a boy and girl twin which it won’t even acknowledge. I say if you can fix the multiples section this app would be amazing for all but right now it only works for singleton pregnancy
327,327,5,2018-08-03T21:32:57.000Z,em_91_ma,L O V E,I absolutely LOVED using this app while I was pregnant. It gives you a new little tidbit about how your baby is progressing everyday! Every week it tells you an approximate of how big your baby is getting and there are different categories you can choose from. I loved all the intricate things it tells you about your baby and how there’s something new every day. Strongly recommend downloading and using this app 😊
328,328,5,2019-03-01T17:40:29.000Z,Ciscosmandy,Best and easiest pregnancy app,When I found out i was pregnant I downloaded every pregnancy app I could get my hands on and I can honestly say Ovia is the best. None of the other apps show you your babies hands and feet size as pregnancy progresses. Nor have a free kick and contraction counter. I LOVE the features on this app and have learned so much. They have weekly pregnancy videos as pregnancy progresses and to do lists to help stay on top of this.
329,329,5,2021-01-24T22:52:03.000Z,nativeplantmama,So far so good!,I’ve been enjoying the Ovia app so far. It’s been interesting and so informative. It covers so many relevant topics a woman can think of while pregnant... and even some you may not have thought of. I also love the development information.
330,330,4,2017-12-28T15:15:24.000Z,Shestie!,Best pregnancy app,I love this app. There are a few changes I would like to see. 1. Save medication list. - I have a couple prescription medications that I have to take but the app will not save it to my profile. I have to re-search them daily to log what I took. 2. I took a bunch of survey type questions and am unsure why or what purpose they serve...? Clarity would be nice.
331,331,3,2018-01-07T18:08:34.000Z,KatieA-in-LA,Good but not custom enough to me,"Ovia has been a great resource for me throughout my pregnancy mostly to follow the week by week changes in my body and baby’s development. I have had issues simply opening the app, it crashes 2 or 3 times before it will open- every time. I also think my tracking isn’t really talking to the rest of the content I’m receiving. I don’t see what I log or input making any difference. Basically I go between this and “the bump” app like a weekly/ sometimes daily newsletter."
332,332,4,2018-02-05T03:01:55.000Z,MimiVotes,Baby fun facts and info..,"I’m now in my second trimester, I have enjoyed opening my app everyday to Check where my little kumquat is growing and developing. Not only learning about my growing baby but important information about me and the baby and what to expect to come in the months ahead. But I would like to see some exercise suggestions for those who"
333,333,3,2018-03-23T12:21:27.000Z,SarahDStewart,Great when it opens,"I had the app for my first pregnancy and used it religiously. I just found out I’m expecting again, so naturally this was the first thing I used to start tracking data points. However, I can’t seem to get it to open. For a while, it would show me the Ovia Pregnancy title screen for a few seconds before crashing, but would open on subsequent attempts. Now it crashes no matter how many times I try to open it. This seems to be a common issue based on user reviews."
334,334,3,2018-05-20T13:26:26.000Z,nblubaugh,Improvements,"First off, I love this app. This is my second time around using it. With that being said, I can only think of two things that would make me happier with this product:"
335,335,5,2018-12-29T01:38:55.000Z,93Rachel,App,This answers so many unknown questions for first time pregnancy. Absolutely love this App!
336,336,5,2020-12-20T15:55:04.000Z,brelynn123,Amazing App!,"By far the best app I’ve ever had to track my pregnancy. The app gives me tips, tells me what to expect, tells me how big my baby is and I love the little footprints and handprints that grow as your baby grows to see how big their hand / foot is in the womb compared to how big their hand / foot will be when they’re out! This app is my favorite. I used it with my daughter in 2018 and I am using it now for my son."
337,337,5,2020-12-20T02:34:04.000Z,Mrs. Huckebizzle,Very helpful,I love checking in every week to see what is happening with the baby and my body as well. One of my favorite features is the one where you can see what the baby would normally have developed by now from the perspective of the womb. Also puts my mind at ease when I read about symptoms I am having that week to let me know that many things are common.
338,338,5,2020-12-19T03:57:16.000Z,phaws99,Best Pregnancy App!!,This app tells you everything in detail about you and your baby week by week! I love seeing pictures of how big baby is getting. You can customize the app to fit your style and even change what the category on how they are comparing worldly items to your baby for size reference! I preferred the fruit and veggie category but there is lots to choose from and it’s all FREE!!! A-ma-zing!!
339,339,5,2020-03-05T22:45:12.000Z,Asia suesan,Highly recommended,"This app is by far the BEST one to use it tells you everything you need to know . How your baby is growing. Safety tips in everything you could possibly think of , very useful for first time pregnancy especially, and even when baby is coming or close to arriving helps you get ready ive used it for both pregnancies and I wouldn’t choose any other app !"
340,340,5,2017-11-08T07:37:43.000Z,ddonnamurcraw,Amazed,"This app is really different unique and fun to use... I love the colorful aspect to it which makes pregnancy a lot more to enjoyable; especially when you are having a not so good day. When you open the app it's so easy to work, and to find information about almost anything. Their is so many things you can read and knowledge yourself about while laying in bed. I personally loves it."
341,341,5,2018-02-05T04:54:03.000Z,rosinamaryanne,Great app!,"Love this app it's been really useful and very informative each week, would prefer a little more info in between weeks but not sure there is much for them to add honestly! My only one issue with the app is that when going to the contraction timer it takes a while to load and I feel like I can never get an accurate timing, otherwise can't fault it"
342,342,5,2018-04-29T14:12:25.000Z,Any-mous,I love the daily updates about my baby’s development,"The Ovia Pregnancy app has been great so far! I am in my 26th week, and Ovia gives me an update about my baby’s development EVERY SINGLE DAY! I love it. The feature I like the most is the food size comparison. It really gives you a realistic idea of how big your baby is every week. From a peppercorn size to now a butternut squash, I am still enjoying the weekly “size” update."
343,343,5,2018-06-23T18:14:03.000Z,MelanieMary,Great app,This is my second time around using this app.... I didn’t love it with my first pregnancy because I had twins and there was little to no info on twin pregnancies. I feel like that should definitely be a bigger part to this app... especially since twin pregnancies are not too uncommon now a days. This time around I’m not sure if I’m having another set of multiples or not so we’ll see how it goes.
344,344,5,2018-09-20T11:40:06.000Z,Vanessa21❤️,Great App!!,"I’ve been using this app since 6 weeks pregnant I’m now 32 weeks and I have to say it’s very easy and convenient to have it tracks every step of your pregnancy, gives you advise and shows you how baby is growing I love it I can say it’s almost accurate to what I have found online with my doctor and other apps very good app definitely recommend to those expecting moms!!"
345,345,3,2018-12-04T07:55:12.000Z,"Andi,N",Weird choice of terminology used at times,"I like the app well enough, especially the ability to enter information about how the pregnancy is going, but I don’t like the inaccurate terms they use to describe the baby early on. At six weeks they say he/she’s a ‘human-being-to-be’. That’s biologically wrong. She’s a human in the early stages of development. I’m not carrying a chicken embryo that magically turns into a human when they look more like what we expect them to. Dehumanizing my baby doesn’t help me like this app more. I’d rather use The Bump."
346,346,5,2021-03-16T08:15:13.000Z,Jdub159,Favorite App,I love how easy this app is to use and the fact that you can track as much or as little as you want. To me that makes it very user friendly since I might not always remember to enter data. I’ve used this app with all three of my children and it has only improved since I first used it. It’s also really fun to show my kids the baby growth tracker.
347,347,5,2021-03-13T16:49:44.000Z,Tei M,Ovia and Ovia Pregnancy,"These apps are incredibly helpful! I use it to track all aspects of my health, including what I eat and how I’m sleeping. I am now pregnant and when I added that data to Ovia, it congratulated me and sent me to the Ovia Pregnancy where I can track doctors appointments and it even shows me how my baby is growing every week, it signed me up with a baby registry list. For a first time mom, this is extremely helpful!"
348,348,5,2021-01-22T21:31:27.000Z,Dog Mom21,It’s Great!,"I love this app. You can customize the app. Different colors, showing the size of your baby, and providing interesting information on baby development. It also shares recipes and health information. It easy to navigate and understand. You can also anonymously share posts, ask questions of other moms, and provide advice. I highly recommend it for any pregnant woman."

350,350,3,2017-11-13T09:06:27.000Z,Asianbean,Decent,"This app is pretty decent. Cute pictures and themes you can design. Can put in your info and babies info, even change it later. The writing is informative especially being a first time Mom. I gave it a 3 star due to the weekly videos not being so informative. The videos were good in the beginning, then got less informative and boring the further I have been going along. Watching the weekly videos was my highlight of this app but now it isn’t so great. Could use updates."
351,351,5,2018-06-02T14:03:11.000Z,Carissajenay,Love!,I love everything about this app. Any question that the doctor might have for me I can answer because of how much detail you can add in what you’re documenting. And they helped me get pregnant much faster than without using the app. I had tried for over a year without the app. It only took a few months after downloading the app! I was more in tune with my body :) 5/5!
352,352,5,2018-09-06T18:13:17.000Z,KimberlyRennn,Love this app,I found out I was pregnant and wanted an app to help keep track of things. This app helps track everything! I love how you can log all your symptoms everyday to better track how you’ve  been feeling. The articles and community gives so much insight and helps me to know that what I’m feeling is completely normal. 10/10 recommend this app to help track pregnancy.
353,353,5,2018-12-13T07:30:09.000Z,mrs. derosier,Informative and helpful,"I downloaded all of the pregnancy apps. Most of them were very similar and repetitive. I love Ovia because it is different and I feel like it is more useful that the other ones. I also love all the different types of notes you can track and I love the layout. It’s very user friendly, even for an over worked over tired mom with pregnancy brain!"
354,354,5,2018-12-31T16:34:30.000Z,sea_chellles,Modern and efficient,"I love how well this app is laid out. The modern interface and current features are exactly what techy  moms and “expecting” millennials need to experience. I also love how the pregnancy app is a continuation from the TTC app. It’s seamless and requires just the right amount newly information from the mom-to-be. I love the day-to-day updates, as it offers I sight into what’s happening in our bodies with the developing babies."
355,355,5,2019-01-01T19:36:06.000Z,AnneWilliams,Great App,I started off with the Ovia fertility tracker app than switched to Ovia pregnancy it is wonderful to see what’s going on in the different stages with your baby. I am still learning new stuff weekly with this app. I even share it with my husband so he can see all the new developments with the baby since he isn’t home but a couple times a week . It makes us feel more connected.
356,356,5,2019-05-28T18:49:59.000Z,Taylor Kay Lee,So many tools,"I love Ovia. It has many tools for your pregnancy. I like the medication safety lookup the most. I have to be on a lot of medications for my own health, but don’t want to risk my baby’s health. This app has a tool that ensures I know what safe for baby. There’s also a good safety lookup. The only 1 thing I would change, is if the app had two representations of baby. One cute cartoon, and one very realistic 3 D interactive model."
357,357,5,2019-10-07T19:56:43.000Z,KelciTC,Best one out there!,"I stumbled across this my first pregnancy and loved then second pregnancy decided to see what the other apps were like that had more downloads. None of them were anywhere close to this one! This app is beautiful, easy to use and has an awesome dashboard that makes me feel connected with where my baby is at along with relevant helpful articles for me!"
358,358,4,2020-03-06T01:14:21.000Z,Tem4135,Great But...,"Why does the app think that all women’s bodies work like machines?  We do not ALL ovulate exactly 12 days after the first day of our last period, so why is it when I put in the date I know I ovulated (based on test strips) it changes the first day of my last period? Any time I change one it automatically changes the other. It’s probably the pregnancy hormones talking, but treating women’s bodies like they all work like little identical clocks really irritates me."
359,359,5,2019-06-27T00:20:57.000Z,bigmomma0629,love it!,i love this app. its very informational. i love how it shows you the sizes of your baby as it grows 🥰 what i love the most is being able to communicate and ask questions with other mothers who go through the same things/symptoms as you! and its great that you once you have your baby you dont have to say goodbye you can head on over to Ovia Parenting! i love it definitely the best baby app yet!
360,360,5,2017-10-09T01:46:39.000Z,Tkel87,In Love With These Apps,"Ovia was very helpful throughout my journey to conceive and my pregnancy. My most adored feature was the weekly comparisons, they were spot on."
361,361,5,2017-11-19T13:47:48.000Z,Frustated and Very Unhappy,First Time Mom- it has been amazing!,"I used the Ovia Fertility app, and when I got pregnant, it automatically downloaded the Pregnancy app. Info is concise, accurate and very much in line with my doctor’s advice. It also helped to show my hubby what was going on."
362,362,5,2018-01-03T16:21:41.000Z,Zadafanatic,App,"It is an excellent app that really informs you of what is going on not only with your baby everyday, but yourself! It tells you what your baby is the size of, what your baby is growing currently, what to expect each week with yourself and the baby. You can communicate with other mamas if you have questions and you will be anonymous. The only app I have and it meets all my needs."
363,363,5,2018-10-24T19:49:14.000Z,1836ha,Loveee,I love this app it helps you remember to track your prenatals and shows what your baby compares to and you can pic from different categories of things to compare sizes. And change the color and style. It gives you tips and keeps you updated on how the baby is growing also shows how big hands and feet get compared to when they are born. It’s a great app for new moms.
364,364,5,2021-03-30T19:55:18.000Z,runner061,Easy to use. Very informative!,"I use this app every day. I love how I can track my food, activity and weight gain to make sure I’m staying healthy while pregnant. It’s a great place to store milestones, notes from doctor’s appointments, etc. don’t forget the daily reminder to take the prenatal! Finally, there are a couple daily reads that keep me informed throughout my pregnancy. Highly recommend"
365,365,5,2021-03-12T19:06:47.000Z,Ashley62525353,Love love love!!!,"I love this app, and have recommended it to my other pregnant mommies! My favorite was seeing how big he got each week, and the handprint is amazing! It was awesome to see it grow and change over the course of the pregnancy. I liked that there were small little facts, as well as longer detailed info. It gave a good balance. I'll use this again for my next baby for sure!!"
366,366,5,2020-04-01T16:28:54.000Z,AllisonSS2018,Great app,This is the best app I have used to track pregnancy. I had a miscarriage in January at only 5 and 1/2 weeks and the app made it easy to report it. Low and behold the next month I conceived again! (After 4 years of infertility) and today marks 8 weeks and this pregnancy is going much better! The app absolutely makes it easy to track everything you feel! ☺️
367,367,3,2019-11-04T02:54:23.000Z,13rasfield,Basic,I used the Ovia fertility app per a friend’s suggestion and then downloaded the pregnancy app earlier this year. It has all been fairly basic and easy to use. I have enjoyed the little tid bits it has offered from symptoms to how baby is doing.
368,368,5,2020-12-17T19:31:46.000Z,Abelst,Great app!,"It is very informative, and is great for tracking our progress. Every morning my husband asks “what’s new with our baby today?” And I open the app. I like how it reminds me to take my vitamins and the ability to create a baby registry automatically is awesome! Since this is my first baby, the idea of creating one from scratch (I have no idea what we will need) was a littler overwhelming."
369,369,3,2020-03-19T13:06:20.000Z,ashbeachbum,Leaves out single moms and too many ads,I would rank this app higher if I didn’t feel completely excluded as a single mother by choice. Never once have I read anything geared towards my growing demographic on this app. That in addition to the ridiculous amount of ads in the daily feed makes me reluctant to read more than once a week. Times are changing and many women are not waiting around for the perfect partner to create their families. Time to change with the times Ovia.
370,370,3,2017-10-18T11:33:24.000Z,Jalac12345,Formula ads!,I really enjoy the ovia app and generally find it really helpful and fun! I was disappointed to see that the company partners with baby formula companies in their marketing - it is proven that these relationships decrease breastfeeding rates! It's why baby friendly hospitals don't give out formula samples anymore and use them only when there's a medical necessity or the mother makes the choice on her own.  It truly makes an impact. I would like to see the app support breastfeeding without competing commercial interests in their ads.
371,371,4,2018-05-21T22:54:38.000Z,Serita Marie,Very accessible features,"I love this app because of the community tab where you can ask or answer questions with other mothers and be anonymous! The calendar is also helpful because it shows you when exactly your week changed during pregnancy and helps me put it my appointments. However, I do wish there were more articles and information to read day to day on this app."
372,372,4,2018-06-07T12:55:39.000Z,mean chickens.,Ovia,"The app itself is very informative. It has a prenatal vitamin reminder that I desperately need. There’s a community posting board of you have questions or need to talk to other moms. The only issue I have isn’t really with the app itself, there’s a lot of moms who reply to the post and they are down right hateful sometimes. They talk down to the poster etc. Maybe an improvement would be to have all responses approved before being posted."
373,373,2,2018-09-24T05:22:45.000Z,907manda,Needs improvement to be more helpful,"The daily information is great! But the community part needs work. Either other users aren’t seeing the posts or they don’t comment. In the dozen of posts I’ve made personally only get a couple replies each post. Nothing overly helpful for the questions being asked. Also maybe monitor for when comments are being down right rude or attacking the OP or commenters . Come on we all are there for the same thing, support from other moms, moms to be or those TTC. Wish baby bump app was still active!"
374,374,5,2019-03-22T12:08:33.000Z,Sierra Allison,Love it!!,"Ovia is an amazing app! I am on my first pregnancy and I downloaded 3-4 apps and this one is the best by far. There is so much information and fun facts to read throughout your pregnancy. I like being able to adjust the themes from fruit to animals etc. keeping track of your pregnancy and what normal symptoms are is so easy with this app! 100% recommend for all moms, whether it’s their first child or 10th."
375,375,5,2019-05-30T01:05:58.000Z,Joy_Danison,5 stars,"This app is very helpful for new moms during their first pregnancy, it gives you information on what to expect or why you’re feeling the way you are at the time. Each week it gives you updates of what your baby is growing or what’s going on. You can also change settings where it compares your baby to things which is super cool."
376,376,5,2021-03-31T09:37:22.000Z,TeamSandoval,Twice the Momma,I have used Ovia for several years now and I don’t think if I ever had another baby I’d use a different app. It’s super easy to use and you can enter a lot of information. It helps keep track so literally everything. I also love that there are so many resources available right at your finger tips and they provide them for you. Ovia is amazing!
377,377,5,2021-01-22T21:15:56.000Z,LWills305,Extremely useful,Extremely useful throughout my pregnancy. I enjoyed the size comparisons they offered as well as all of the tracking options. When I was in labor I used their contraction counter which was awesome. The community feature is nice to stay connected to other moms going through what you are going through in this Covid world we currently live in.
378,378,4,2020-12-18T19:32:23.000Z,eskimomum1911,Enjoyable,I’ve used a few other apps to track cycles/pregnancy and I’ve enjoyed Ovia so far. I like the home page where it gives you all your info and articles to read that are pertinent. The calendar feature is helpful to keep track of appointments and happenings to journal later. Adding symptoms/mood/sleep etc and medicine tracking is a bonus. I’ll try out the cycle and parenting apps once they are applicable to me!!
379,379,2,2020-04-11T19:16:51.000Z,quinn^2,Not diverse and just not great,"While this app is nice, it does not show any women of color/ babies of color in the pictures of the articles or really have any articles geared towards WOC. If I’m not mistaken not many of the articles are written by WOCs either. Moreover, not enough content to explore on the daily in general for any woman. Lastly, the fruit that they choose don’t make since with the object sizes in the other categories. I would not recommend if you are a socially conscious woman who values diversity or someone looking for an exciting app through our special time!"
380,380,4,2017-12-02T14:44:54.000Z,panda1210,Great app with some bumps...,It was a fantastic app! I loved keeping up with my baby’s development but once the update happened the app started to crash every time I opened it. I’m going to keep it for the rest of my pregnancy and even with this flaw I would still recommend this to friends. I was able to put this app on several different phones and so family could keep up with his development. It really is a good app!
381,381,5,2018-03-28T04:44:46.000Z,JulienJ,"Love the App, so useful","I love Ovia. It gives me great fun updates and actually allows me to learn a bit more what’s actually going on during the pregnancy. My favorite thing are the video updates from Gina. It’s like a good friend with lots of experience is pregnant with you at the same time and is giving you all these great tips, advice and information about what’s going."
382,382,5,2018-07-07T07:14:48.000Z,mandyandleo,My favorite app so far!,"I’ve tried several apps throughout my pregnancy. I wish that I would have found it sooner. I enjoy going on the app and seeing where my baby is weekly. It gives you comparisons, what to expect, and what going on in your body and your baby’s body. It is a great source of information when you don’t always have your doctor."
383,383,5,2018-10-29T15:27:09.000Z,riceandtofu,Perfect pregnancy app,"If you are going to download 1 pregnancy app, use this one! It has a calendar, the same information as what to expect and other apps, and shows you the size of your baby every week including hands and feet (: you can also log your meds, symptoms, and other information. Super recommend for other expecting mommas❤️"
384,384,3,2018-10-31T21:27:39.000Z,Noel Athearn,Not impressed?,"So I like the app and all the info it gives I’ve been using it since I found out I was pregnant, I’m now 22 weeks and some odd days. My complaint though is that the baby sizing it has with animals or food is super off. I don’t think it’s accurate at all. I’m thinking about switching apps just because of that because it annoys me so much, saying my baby is about 12” long now and then says it’s like an ear of corn or a guinea pig??? I’ve never had an ear of corn be a foot long or a guinea pig."
385,385,5,2019-03-15T21:04:50.000Z,LoKeiSmith,Spot on information,"I started usei g the ovia fertility app , i was tracking my cycle and trying to understand being ""fertile"".. Omce i missed my first period ovia suggested tbat i take a pregnancy test and boom! I waa definitely pregnant and i immediately switched to the pregnancy app to track how far alongi might be and when i went to the dr ovias results were the exact same as my drs findings..love this app alot of support here 24/7 .."
386,386,5,2019-06-08T11:01:18.000Z,Coral297,Favorite!,"I’ve used this pregnancy app through both my pregnancies. It is awesome! Very informative on how your baby is changing, growing and what is going on with your body week by week. It has great info on what foods and medicine to enjoy/avoid. I really like the fun and practical ways they show what size your baby is by week (I.e. a chihuahua) It has videos from expectant moms. Overall, I love this app!!!!"
387,387,5,2019-12-22T15:42:44.000Z,mrsaohitch,Look forward to it daily!,My husband and I both downloaded the app when we first found out I was pregnant. I was nervous about which app to chose as I’ve experienced losses. This app has been fantastic with education about the baby and the pregnancy. We both love the app and highly recommend it. The kick counter timer and food safety look up have been so helpful! 💞
388,388,5,2019-08-11T14:04:44.000Z,mommak31ly,Awesome,"I love the simplistic design similar to social media. You have all your body and baby updates plus some helpful articles if you’re struggling with mental health too. Also love how you can choose your own color theme and baby growth theme such as your baby is as big as a certain animal or toy. Lastly, I like how for the fact that it’s free you get so many features and updates."
389,389,5,2021-01-23T00:00:58.000Z,Natnatbonbon12345,Favorite pregnancy app,"This app is exciting and helpful to use when you have conceived. It has lots of health surveys, reminders and ideas about nutrition and physical activity at different weeks of pregnancy. There are little reminders, the ability to take photos, track your moods and symptoms. This app is amazing for first time moms, and beyond! It’s very easy to use and quite helpful!"
390,390,5,2018-02-25T15:52:36.000Z,Betty machete 727,Totally helps ease my mind,I’m a bit of a worrier because I work in a NICU and of course I have to find out I’m pregnant super early at five weeks. This app helps me to process what me and my little one might be going through and mentally grounds me for what I can do better to make sure my pregnancy is great and uneventful. I love it so far! I expect this to be even more awesome in my second and third trimester!
391,391,3,2018-05-29T22:48:28.000Z,DCee7,like not love,"I was excited to use this app because I used Ovia when I was trying to get pregnant. At first, I really liked it. But once I downloaded other pregnancy applications I noticed the difference between this one and others. This one is either ahead or behind on the size of the baby compared to all other ones that state the same thing. Also, I feel this app does not provide as much information regarding the development of babies. I expected more."
392,392,5,2018-08-03T11:26:03.000Z,lchill89,An actually smart pregnancy app,"This has all the features you’d expect with week to week tracking and notes, along with a Calendar that overlays your inputs with weekly milestones. The data collection is really, really impressive though, AND the app is subtly responsive to your entrances such as providing items in your newsfeed to help you manage “symptoms” you report."
393,393,5,2018-10-06T14:40:48.000Z,Glassygirl,Useful,"Ovia is a really useful app for pregnancy. I probably only use a quarter of the features, but it is still a great tool for logging my food, looking up food safety, logging weight gain, and getting cute updates on baby’s development. I picked ovia because of the bakery size comparisons—some of which are totally bizarre, but that’s with fruit and animals too—and I’ve learned about some new French pastries."
394,394,3,2019-01-07T01:24:05.000Z,homebirth momma,A little disappointing,I am having a homebirth with a midwife and there is no such option for adding that in your details.
395,395,4,2019-02-23T07:00:05.000Z,nessa chumpz,App is great,"had this app since i was 8 weeks i love it you see ur baby grow every week it’s amazing the articles and the mommy section where u can answer or ask questions. But it does need a little updating on that section maybe being able to post pictures, a notification tab, more characters for the question and answers. Little things like that would be great! overall GREAT APP WOULD RECOMMEND SISTERS 🥰🥰🥰"
396,396,5,2019-04-12T06:21:40.000Z,Ven2x,BEST BABY APP!,"When I found out I was pregnant I quickly searched the Apple store for a Baby app that’ll help guide me through pregnancy. Not only did Ovia do just that, it’s also very helpful after birth. My baby is almost 2 months and I check Ovia once a week for new updates and things to know about my body (inside and out) and my baby’s as well. Definitely worth five stars!"
397,397,5,2021-01-24T20:44:21.000Z,JSams2019,Perfect Pregnancy App,"I absolutely am in love with this app, it gives so much information on a daily basis, as well as reminding women to take their prenatal (which some need reminders). I love that it shows me the handprint and footprint size, also how big my baby is. I feel this app should have a billboard in every town so that more women can try it out and be just as amazed and grateful as I am!"
398,398,5,2020-12-23T14:27:53.000Z,karrro,My favorite!,"This app was the best one for me during my pregnancy. It had many educational blogs posted daily and gave me a better idea of how my little one was developing and what he possibly was doing. The weekly reminders were great, as I had pregnancy brain the whole 2nd and 3rd trimester, and I just loved being able to have a place to write down my symptoms and experiences."
399,399,5,2020-12-11T16:39:48.000Z,GreekNurseHelen,Loved using this to track my pregnancies!,"I check this app daily during my pregnancies and reading all the helpful information it provided me definitely gave me reassurance, especially during my first pregnancy! As soon as you enter a positive pregnancy test on the fertility app it prompts you to download this one and it is so nice to have all that information at your fingertips! Love it!"
400,400,5,2017-09-21T14:00:50.000Z,Metlmomy,Great app,"Love the app.  The update isn't THAT bad.  It did make some things a little less user friendly, but definitely not something to get worked up about. I DO wish that when you “hide and do not show similar items” that it actually didn’t show similar items. I don’t need to see the same ad every day if I’ve hidden it every day"
401,401,5,2017-11-08T12:43:40.000Z,Poop 7124,Keeps you up to date on your growing baby.,Gives you cute updates to let you know what baby is doing now. Also let's you know what symptoms you might expect. The app can also track your weight as you go along so you can see if you are gaining too little or too much. Along with MANY other features such as medication safety lookup.
402,402,5,2018-04-30T07:39:31.000Z,SexySchenk,What a great app!!!,"This app is AMAZING!!! Love all the articles and videos! The trackers are very helpful and my husband loves when I share everything with him, especially what the size of the babies are compared to every week 😊 we started with the Ovia fertility tracker after trying for 11 months on our own and were able to graduate to Ovia Pregnancy tracker just 3 months later!!!"
403,403,5,2018-05-13T00:09:18.000Z,Srostephy27,Thank you!,I just want to say thanks for this app. It was great to have on hand when I wasn’t sure what I could and couldn’t eat. It’s loaded with info in the articles section. It was wonderful waking up every morning to some new tidbit of info and having the weekly update that I shared with my husband. It kept us feeling close to her the entire time. Love this app!
404,404,5,2018-07-04T15:38:33.000Z,JennMcW,Best pregnancy app,I tried a few pregnancy apps but this one has the best overall info. I like the daily and weekly updates but it also has a section to quickly look up food safety and how to check symptoms which was really nice. I didn’t find that same info on other apps. It’s also customizable which makes it more personal.
405,405,5,2018-10-26T03:18:22.000Z,Tausla,Great help!,"Hands down the best baby app to have! So much information daily and weekly and definitely saves you on all the unnecessary calls to your OB/midwife haha. The only thing I’d change is maybe a little more customization to the baby itself. For example if you could log baby’s weight, growth age at scans, etc. but other than that, the perfect app!"
406,406,5,2018-12-05T21:00:40.000Z,emsauti,Obsessed!!!!!!!!!!!!,I started with Ovia to try and conceive my little one. It worked!  So I moved over to the pregnancy ovia app and just gave birth to my daughter YESTERDAY! So now I’ve downloaded the baby ovia app . Thank you ovia for all the helpful tips from the very beginning through all the baby updates during pregnancy for me AND my baby and for the help you’ll give me throughout my little ones life.
407,407,5,2020-01-05T19:25:18.000Z,MJB197905,Just right,Great app with really good digestible chunks. I’ve been using it since I missed my first period (after the Ovia period tracking app noticed I was late lol). I’m now 30 weeks pregnant.  I’ve used it to track my weights and blood pressures and to follow size of baby. Every week there are nice videos and there are some adverts but they’re very gentle and mostly useful. So glad this is free!
408,408,5,2021-04-22T02:56:44.000Z,Cvida1984,Very helpful,"I have been using this app almost daily to track my pregnancy progress, weight, check if certain foods/medications are safe, keep up with appointments, and more. It’s so informative and such a great supplement to the care and information I get from my healthcare team. My husband loves looking at the little hands and feet and comparing them every week."
409,409,5,2021-01-21T19:31:53.000Z,MommyE2016,Best app ever,My Ovia experience has absolutely been wonderful this is now my second pregnancy I have used this app for and the information of the pregnancy like on the weeks you’re on it’s just so accurate and has been so helpful to both of my pregnancies I would definitely recommend this app to any of my pregnant friends thank you so much
410,410,4,2018-01-29T19:15:03.000Z,HayHayitzaBayBay,Perfect App! Except for one thing...,This app is absolutely amazing! There's just one problem. I can almost never make the app open. The loading screen will appear for 3 minutes then just shut off. It's like a 1/100 chance it'll work. But when it does oh my god is it amazing! Please work on making the app open. I'd love to be able to log my milestones everyday if I could get the app to open. Thank you.
411,411,5,2018-07-08T17:23:32.000Z,Mami P19,Review,"Honestly this app is by far my most favorite as it keeps me motivated, well informed and excited for the growth of my Baby P. I had a Mc earlier in the year and was using other app and I must admit every time I’d get off I would feel very anxious and fearful because of all the negative “self diagnoses” other women would leave constantly. That to me is unnecessary stress which we don’t need."
412,412,5,2018-09-15T12:07:23.000Z,acc326,First Time Mom,"I love how much you can track in this app: mood, meals, sleep, steps, exercise, appointments, you name it. I also love that based on your inputs, it updates your feed with articles that you can most likely relate to."
413,413,5,2019-02-14T00:25:07.000Z,Mari3🌸,You won’t regret using this app !!!,"I am 5 weeks postpartum with my first child and I can definitely say that I had so many questions and sometimes wondered if certain things were normal during pregnancy, as well as wanting to know how my baby is growing this app helped me stay calm and learn so many things. I truly love it!! I’d definitely recommend it!!!"
414,414,5,2019-02-15T15:17:19.000Z,MomBoss2015,Such a great supportive app,"This app has carried me through a pregnancy, miscarriage and another pregnancy. It’s so supportive and has all the information I need to feel informed and follow along. I love the updates on my growing baby and have started sharing them with my son to help him get excited about being a big brother. What a fun way to stay connected to my baby in a busy world!"
415,415,5,2019-04-21T21:19:08.000Z,HarpersWife15,2nd time mommy,Using this app again for my 2nd pregnancy both my babies will be Ovia babies planned for with the fertility app watched over by the pregnancy app and continued on into their life with the parenting app I love them all and always have at least 2 if not all 3 on my phone ready to use whenever I need! Very easy to use and leader of the pack when it come to women’s health/fertility apps
416,416,5,2019-05-24T03:04:12.000Z,cooks101.,🤰🏻,"I am 27 weeks pregnant, with my second baby, and this app teaches me so much everyday, things that I didn’t even know with my first child, I love it so much, I love the videos from Gina we get every week as well, that’s so sweet of her to take time out her busy life to make them for us, I plan to keep this app now and even after I have my baby, thank you for this ❤️"
417,417,5,2020-12-11T19:02:18.000Z,Ericalynnxoxo,Great Pregnancy App,I’ve used this app When I found out I was pregnant. It’s really easy to use. It shows you up-to-date information. It’s especially great for someone who’s never been pregnant before and doesn’t know what to expect. With so many convenient and easy access tabs that explain every step of the process. I recommend this app.
418,418,4,2019-11-08T02:14:12.000Z,Love racing!!,4.5 stars..,"I love this app, but I find it frustrating how easily it wants to slide over to the next post in the community section. Scrolling down should not be this difficult. When I try to scroll down, it passes to the next page. This only happens in the community section. Seems like the side swipe sensitivity is pretty high. I hope this makes sense... otherwise.. it’s my favorite pregnancy app."
419,419,4,2019-09-10T04:27:30.000Z,AConcernMother,Just a thought..,I absolutely love this app! It has kept me calm my whole pregnancy. The only down fall I have is I noticed you all have everything listened from blood pressure to other things but nothing about diabetics or anything about diabetes that’s the only thing lacking to me on this app I’m a Type 2 diabetic and it would be nice to have something about diabetes and pregnancy to read about and learn more of.
420,420,5,2017-12-24T15:11:15.000Z,BillyBobJoeThortonPuddintang,Ovia pregnancy,I used this with my first kid in 2015 and was super stoked to use it again with this pregnancy! When I logged back on I loved loved loved the changes they made! Haha every week I look at all the different things that could be the size of the baby and they’ve add the foot size:) I recommend this app to all my pregnant friends and they end up loving it just as much as me:)
421,421,3,2019-05-07T14:25:36.000Z,Souryellowfruit,Wish it didn’t need internet to load,I like this app a lot but the fact that you need internet to look at anything means it’s not super useful if you happen to be in a room with no reception...like at the doctor’s office. I use it to see where I’m at in my pregnancy but have to use other options to be able to actually pull up notes when I’m with the doctor. Wish they would update it so your info would download onto your phone.
422,422,5,2019-05-16T02:53:32.000Z,Kaydensmama,Love it!,"I love that not only does this app provide valuable pregnancy information, tips, and updates, but it’s the only app I’ve come across that allows you to track symptoms, food intake, mood, etc. I love the personalization available as well as the weekly updates (especially the sweet hand and footprints!). I only wish I had found this app 4 pregnancies ago!"
423,423,5,2021-05-02T10:43:35.000Z,kat62910,Love this app,I have used this app for my 3 pregnancies and it’s been so helpful. Helping me learn what to expect and what foods are best to eat during what stage. I am truly loving it. I love you get to see pictures of what baby must look like and after birth what to expect with your newborn. Although this isn’t my forst baby it’s nice to have the reminder of the sleep regression and all that.
424,424,5,2021-04-02T02:36:43.000Z,JulieHeath,Awesome,I have so many questions all the time and I’m even on my third pregnancy. All are so different. This has helped me so much. The articles section is great. A lot of information so you don’t feel alone or lost. I love being able to track everything. It almost gives me something to take my kind off of the waiting game.
425,425,5,2021-01-23T11:55:50.000Z,njd0603,Great features,"This app helped me throughout my pregnancy. This app does not just track your baby’s growth, but provides moms with information about their body and transformation as well. I downloaded the app after I found out I was pregnant, but there are some helpful features for those who are looking to track their ovulation and best prepare for their pregnancy."
426,426,5,2020-12-22T11:54:02.000Z,arlinenahz,Best pregnancy app,"This app was amazing during my entire pregnancy, the help provided for mental support, unbelievable I was seriously amazed when I had no one I could easily message the support team and they would always always message back, now that I had my baby I’m using the parenting app. Highly highly recommended you won’t regret downloading this app"
427,427,5,2020-12-21T16:25:08.000Z,Raynababy999,Easy,I love this app! Everything about it is just so easy but in a good way. I love the reminders to see if I’ve been taking my prenatal vitamins as well as giving me updates on Bean and being able to track how i’m feeling and symptoms I may be experiencing. This is the first pregnancy I’ve been able to use this app for and so far it’s doing a great job!
428,428,5,2020-01-07T00:28:14.000Z,Mkleigh1244,Informational and Accurate,"Everything you need when trying to conceive and after you do! I attribute a lot of my fertility success to this app because of how well you can place your fertile window. Once pregnant there are a ton of different informational articles, facts, photos, videos, and Q&As that really help you understand each stage of your pregnancy. Love it!"
429,429,4,2019-10-18T14:07:55.000Z,antisocialmom,Cute but needs work,I gave this app 4 stars because I love everything except the objects they compare the babies size to. I would really love if you guys used more general household items. Some of the vegetables are fine but a lot of times I have to go look up a person holding the item they suggest so I can see what the heck they’re talking about. A lot of them are weird things I’ve never heard of.
430,430,4,2017-10-02T23:58:55.000Z,Auntcheezy,Very happy,"Giving this app a 4 star because nothing is perfect and I’m not completely happy with it. Although, I’m still happy nonetheless. I have another app that shows computerized images of what baby should look like week by week. If this app had this feature I’d consider a 5. Other than that I love this app. One of my favorite features is that you can nickname the baby to whatever you like. :)"
431,431,3,2017-12-13T02:44:51.000Z,CK611,Issues with loading,"When I can open it, I love this app. I like seeing how big my baby is growing, and the updates on his development. Tracking symptoms is helpful and I like saving notes about milestones or questions for my doctor. The community section is usually hysterical. BUT it usually takes at least 15 attempts before the app will open, if it does at all. I’ll have to download another app when it comes time to track my contractions."
432,432,5,2018-05-14T16:57:07.000Z,Selena Marie05,Great App,I love the fact I can get day to day updates of the small things going on with my baby along with helpful suggestions. It makes the whole pregnancy not seem so scary along with the fact there is an entire community who are going through the same thing or similar situations. I love this app and would recommend it to anyone.
433,433,3,2018-09-16T17:03:44.000Z,Kathryn F.,No cohesion,"This app causes a lot of disillusionment. The methods they use to describe the size, relative to the gestational period, is confusing, especially for first time moms. One week she’s a cauliflower: so when I’m in the market I’m looking to gauge my baby’s size, then the next week she’s a pineapple. That’s inconsistent and confusing."
434,434,5,2019-01-09T01:40:37.000Z,xjamie7,"Clear, easy to navigate, & fun!","I downloaded every pregnancy app I could think of and slowly went through the process of elimination. As several were tacky or slammed with ads. Ovia is straight to the facts of pregnancy, also personable with what you choose to do throughout your pregnancy. Community wall to help moms to be and those awkward questions. Highly recommend!"
435,435,4,2019-01-28T11:19:40.000Z,Chelle0617,I love it,When I first found out I was pregnant I downloaded literally every app you could find and I’ve since narrowed it down to basically only using Ovia I love it. I love the texts in the morning and the information and reminders. If there was one thing I would change I wish it had a more in depth diet log... I wish it showed what I may be missing in my diet in a day. But other than that I love using Ovia so far.
436,436,5,2019-01-29T17:24:22.000Z,Jayleabay,A must have pregnancy app,"With the help of the ovia fertility app, I conceived my little gummy bear after 1 try!! I've moved on this this ovia pregnancy app and oh my gosh.. I love it so much!! It's a wonderful community of a variety of mothers. I haven't seen any hateful commenting just a group of mothers being there for one another!! There are so many little gadgets to help pregnancy along, facts, articles, recipes and so much more. MUST HAVE PREGNANCY APP:)"
437,437,5,2021-03-31T10:30:39.000Z,Hekinnet,Great app,"I used this with my first son and now with my second. I love this group of apps, used the pregnancy one with both pregnancies too. The breastfeeding tracker is one of my favorite parts as well. The only thing I wish it had was a spot to track mom’s daily health just like the baby’s feeding, sleeping and pottying. Like tracking medications taken that day, water intake, etc."
438,438,5,2021-03-30T19:35:48.000Z,laur61320,LOVE IT!,"It has so many awesome extra features including a count down until your due date, a diagram comparing your little ones hand to your own, and a short summary of what to expect each week of your journey! It is also filled with useful articles that are well worth the read! 10/10 recommend 😊"
439,439,5,2021-03-25T17:08:17.000Z,Rylee M H,Perfect!,"I got this app just after I found out I was pregnant with my first. I had no idea what I was doing! Ovia helped me keep track of how far along I was, give me updates on how my baby was doing and things I might experience, and had a ton of informational articles! You can track your exercise, symptoms, nutrition, kick counting and contraction counting and lots more!"
440,440,5,2017-12-04T08:20:08.000Z,Jaaasmyne,Absolutely Amazing !,"I Personally Love This App, This Is My First Pregnancy And Ovia Pregnancy Makes Me Even More Excited About My Little One On The Way. I’m Simply Obsessed ! I Catch My Self On The App About Almost 20 Times A Day Lol. It’s Just So Informational Especially If You’re A First Time Mommy To Be. You Can Keep Track With Everything It’s Just Great. I’d Highly Recommend This To All The Future Mother’s Out There, This Apps Where It’s At !"
441,441,5,2018-01-23T19:56:30.000Z,Lisa12849,Great app,I really enjoy using Ovia. I check it every day for articles and updates about what's going on with my pregnancy. I've learned a lot from it and use the food safety lookup and medications lookup features often. I also have it linked to my insurance which is helpful. I will keep using it for the remainder of my pregnancy and again in the future.
442,442,4,2019-02-03T13:33:52.000Z,Lecstratton,Love it!,"I used Ovia Fertility while I was trying to conceive and that app really helped me keep track of my ovulation. As soon as I got pregnant, there was no question as to which app I would use to track my pregnancy. This app is different and I like how it personalizes my experience just by the simply inserting my baby’s name into each developmental milestone. I’m excited to check it every day to see my newest baby’s development."
443,443,5,2019-03-17T13:24:18.000Z,Gina & Jason,The whole package,Trying to get pregnant I found the Ovia app to track my cycle and fertility days.  Once I input a positive pregnancy test it prompt me to download the pregnancy Ovia app and I’ve enjoyed using them both.   Almost all of my information transferred over from one app onto the next and my partner is sent emails and updates daily.  We couldn’t be happier.
444,444,4,2019-04-06T00:45:56.000Z,BambooQueen92,Genders,"I’m only giving it 4 stars because I feel that on the section in your profile where you choose your baby’s gender, it needs to allow you to choose more than one for multiples. I’m pregnant with twins and have to leave the gender as “unknown” because it will only let you choose one or the other even though I have my pregnancy marked as twins. Other than that it’s a pretty great app."
445,445,5,2020-12-10T21:30:48.000Z,sare-sare,Loved it,"I loved this app and used it the most out of all the ones I downloaded. This was my first born child and after a couple miscarriages, I was super paranoid about everything and this app helped ease all my fears and anxiety. I started using the parenting app and when we are ready to try for another little one I will be using the fertility app as well!"
446,446,4,2021-01-06T03:45:05.000Z,AJ Rev,HG support?,"I really do love this app as I am using it for a second pregnancy. Love being able to track weight, symptoms & activity. The biggest downfall.. when I report vomiting/morning sickness and the app tells me “most moms see a lessening in morning sickness by now”, okay I KNOW and also I marked hyperemesis in the special conditions. Really really don’t need to be reminded every day that I am one of the “few” moms still sick. Please acknowledge the hyperemesis moms!"
447,447,5,2020-12-18T20:42:53.000Z,AshleyNicole343,Love it!!!,"I e started using this app for the last few weeks.  I enjoy getting the daily changes and being able to track everything that I’m feeling, along with my appointments!! I used their conception app snd moved on to their pregnancy app once it finally happened!!! Would recommend this to other preform moms out there :)"
448,448,5,2020-12-17T15:06:52.000Z,KLadyPayne,Awesome Parenting App,"I absolutely love the Ovia Parenting App! It helps me track the eating, sleeping, peeing and pooping of my little one. It also has the a space to track milestones and I love that I can give admin access to other family members. My MIL keeps him while I’m at work and she is able to track his day and I can get into the app and see how he’s doing. I highly recommend."
449,449,5,2019-09-25T06:25:56.000Z,adtrgirl0119,Love it!!,"This is one of the best pregnancy apps I could’ve downloaded. The articles, the community section, and even the medication/ food safety and symptom lookup are so helpful for first time moms especially. I’m a first time mom and I feel like this app has taught me so much about pregnancy and what to expect and look forward to when my little Sean makes his debut September 28th 😁 superb app"
450,450,5,2017-11-27T13:22:42.000Z,King062,Love this app,I've been using this app for my 3rd pregnancy and I love it! I used a different one for the first 2 and it was exactly the same the second time. My best friend who's pregnant for the first time suggested this app and I love it. There are so many ways to personalize the content you receive. It's so easy to use and I love the information I'm getting. Thank you!!
451,451,5,2018-01-06T09:27:21.000Z,HlsHhg,I love this app!,"I’m a FTM and my husband and I love seeing the progress of our son every day with this app. I do, however, wish we could share pictures in the comment section with the other moms such as bump pictures, pictures of our babies, etc. I tried lots of other pregnancy apps before finding this one and Ovia has outdone itself! :)"
452,452,4,2018-02-03T20:07:57.000Z,Emilyelephant,Loved it until,My fiancé loves that this app compares the baby’s size to normal things (fun &games) and not just fruits and veggies. I like the daily updates and the ability to search meds and foods to make sure they’re safe during pregnancy. It also has a kick counter and contraction timer.
453,453,1,2018-09-19T19:14:54.000Z,Thecyanbrick,Crappy app,"I’ve never been a big fan of the app. There is no message board (that I can find after searching the 3000 links) except a general board for everyone and their brother. On another app I’m on, I can select the December babies board and talk to people due around the same time as me! And now Ovia added this thing that literally asks you questions every time you sign onto the app and there is no way to opt out of them...you either have to waste time answering them or xing them out. I only go on 1-2 times a week but I may just delete the whole thing."
454,454,5,2018-11-24T21:22:01.000Z,chiquita5686,Simple to use informative a MUST,First time mom here. Ovia has been with me through fertility and now pregnancy. All the descriptions have fit my pregnancy to a T! I love the daily feeds and I love sharing it with my husband. So much easier than r assign a pregnancy book! I wish all mothers could use this app! I think it would help improve healthy pregnancies and healthy babies!
455,455,1,2019-04-11T00:45:00.000Z,DontCallMeHogan,They’re selling your personal info! Don’t do it!,"This app “encourages women to input data related to their pregnancies, from the early months to the birth of their child. The app’s terms of use agreement reportedly gives the developer an “irrevocable license” to “utilize and exploit” their personal data, including “sell, lease or lend[ing]” the data to “third parties.”"
456,456,5,2021-03-13T04:52:53.000Z,Cbendaa,The Best,"Ovia pregnancy is easily my favorite app on my phone.. it’s so exciting growing a human and ovia tells you what to expect this week, how big their little hands and feet are compared to your phone, their size compared to toys or animals, or pastries! I love looking at the new milestones each week and I look forward to it! I would recommend ovia pregnancy to everyone!"
457,457,5,2020-12-08T20:24:42.000Z,clance2424,10/10,I can’t rave about this app enough - I’m a first time mom and I was petrified of learning/retaining all of this new information. Ovia has made it incredibly simple and streamlined everything - from development to nutrition to even my appointments- it tracks it all in one convenient space. I especially love the articles that share tips and tricks.
458,458,5,2020-06-05T16:13:21.000Z,Carlybrooks,Ovia Pregnancy,I loved this app! Seriously used it for everything and I had an amazing pregnancy. The contraction counter was my best friend when going in to labor! I was able to wait it out till 4cm and I had my little man later that day. The videos are my favorite honestly and seeing the different sizes as baby grows. Can’t wait to use it for my second!
459,459,1,2019-11-08T19:34:34.000Z,Qpwirhf dkksnsbe,It’s Fine,"Easy to use but articles are horribly written and negligibly proofread. I loved the fertility app but the pregnancy app is just not the same experience. It’s boring and every week there’s a video with a woman who is at the same point in her pregnancy but she is largely unlikeable. Now that I’m farther along the app has started to lag like crazy too, and it only updates with new articles and information when you open the app."
460,460,5,2018-05-22T05:36:02.000Z,MrsRinard,Amazing!!,"This app is WAY better than what to expect. This app lets you change the theme, put your baby’s name and gender in. It even has symptom look ups, food safety lists, kick counter, contraction counter and a whole bunch more! I love it and I’ve had it for a day! I wish I would’ve known about this app a lot longer than before my third trimester!"
461,461,4,2018-08-22T06:10:48.000Z,kdinny1987,I just wish...,"This app is mostly great. I love the different themes, and the information is helpful & delivered in a way that doesn’t feel stressful or overwhelming. I just wish the daily updates about [insert cute nickname]’s progress would use the gender-neutral pronoun ‘they’ rather than continually alternating back & forth between ‘he’ & ‘she’. We have a word for people (or proto-people) of unknown, indeterminate, or non-binary gender - let’s use it!"
462,462,5,2018-09-26T13:06:42.000Z,Ki Stacks,Love This App ♥️,"To Me , This App Is Amazing. Always Telling Me The Growth My Baby Is Going Through , And Lets Me Communicate Anonymously With Others As Well! They Have Cute Little Comparisons With Your Baby About How Big They Are. And It Also Helps Me Keep Track Of How Many Weeks I Am! I Can Put Down When I Have Appointments And Everything , And The Type Of Appointments They Are. Really Got Nothing Bad To Say About This App Lol"
463,463,5,2021-07-03T01:55:47.000Z,Miahlavmb,Best Pregnancy app ever! Have tried most other app yet this stands out the most!!,Been tracking since the start. Also you can track appointments etc. Talk to people about your pregnancy with the same weeks. You can post everything and ask people if what you feel is normal or not base on mommas Experiences. I recommend this app!!!
464,464,2,2021-08-21T14:20:33.000Z,JessYam,Pregnant “Folks”,It has some cool features - you have different options to compare your baby’s size week to week and it shows the hand and foot comparison as your baby is growing. I don’t find the app that easy to navigate from week to week to get summaries (if you want to go to prior weeks you have to do a lot of scrolling and there’s a lot of junk along the way). What I mainly dislike is the language choice of saying “pregnant folks” it does not sound natural while reading and feels very impersonal.
465,465,5,2020-12-27T16:23:22.000Z,The Poisonous Rose,Stopped working but app support fixed immediately,"I have been using this app since the beginning of my pregnancy. A few days ago it started saying “my device is not compatible with Ovia’s high security standards.” I contacted Ovia app support and they responded immediately and fixed the problem for me, and on a holiday weekend! I’m very impressed and so grateful."
466,466,5,2020-12-18T22:25:43.000Z,gracee.alexis,100% Recommend,I love the Ovia Pregnancy App because of the contraction timer and the kick counts! I also get to see how big the baby is getting each week and you can pick what theme you want for the baby size as well. I love it because each week you get to see how big the hands/feet are getting which make it more realistic.
467,467,5,2020-12-17T05:29:29.000Z,lolo13101,Best pregnancy app,I love how I get an update every morning telling me what size my baby is and keeps me updated on the development of the baby and it also tells me about my body and the changes it is going through and gives me tips on having a successful pregnancy. This is definitely the app I would recommend to all pregnant mamas!
468,468,3,2020-10-07T19:46:20.000Z,aghfyd2020,"Good app, needs a few tweaks","Overall I’ve been happy with Ovia, however, there are a few major things I would love to see changed."
469,469,3,2020-07-05T18:09:28.000Z,Longtime Fitbit lover,Don’t understand chat feature,I’ve been enjoying this app for the last month. I love the little facts each day about your baby’s growth.
470,470,3,2018-05-26T13:54:34.000Z,JayDayTrading,Nothing for multiples,"Like every other app I’ve found, Ovia doesn’t have anything at all for multiples. You can’t even enter a second baby. Extremely disappointing. This would be a 5 star review if they would have had the sense to think about all the people out there who would love to be able to see little pictures of multiple fetuses and it would not have been difficult to do."
471,471,5,2018-07-11T15:02:40.000Z,Ja-Kay,Great pregnancy app,"Love the app.  Relevant and timely articles, provides a food safety checklist which has been enormously helpful especially in the first trimester, helps me keep track of my weight and easy to use calendar to track how many weeks to go.  Of all of the apps I’ve downloaded during my pregnancy this is the one I use the most."
472,472,5,2018-09-09T13:32:12.000Z,keneovkaoan77398;!,Most Accessible Preg App,I downloaded 6 preg apps on my phone when I found out I was pregnant and Ovia had the food and medications indexes which has been a quick and informative go to for week. I check the community quick answers daily and am loving all the extra info I have found daily to support my pregnancy as I go along.
473,473,5,2018-10-11T19:08:41.000Z,Top Elite Fashion,Convenient,"I do have a complaint that after reporting a miscarriage and then getting pregnant again, the app still had all my old information and I had to reset it again. I’m already dealing with a lot of bittersweet feelings."
474,474,5,2019-01-09T11:36:51.000Z,mal0803,This app is a perfect companion for first time moms,"This app was such a comfort, every day I look to see what new developments that been happening to my little girl. The first time I got a Braxton-Hicks contraction I opened this app and was reassured that this was normal. I felt light headed at 27 weeks and was reading that this was a normal development. Made me more comfortable. This app has quality information."
475,475,5,2019-02-12T18:13:30.000Z,aug2019baby,Best app!,"I used ovia before i was pregnant to track my periods and try and get pregnant  it was right on the mark! I loved it! Then I found out they had a pregnancy one and it’s amazing.  I have two other ones that I use for extra info but this one is my daily one.  It makes sure to remind me to take my prenatal, legs me track dr apts.. ect.  And it is literally all free no scam."
476,476,5,2020-01-06T11:15:02.000Z,flower45678,Love all the features!,I love that it has an easy to navigate home page. Also the calendar tab is my next favorite! It’s so easy to look ahead to see how many weeks I’ll be when scheduling my appointments. I also like the community tab! Overall it had everything but is clean and easy to use!

I am only giving a four star review because i wish the organization of the app was a little less scattered. 🙂"
478,478,5,2019-09-17T14:07:37.000Z,nichoebowar,Great App.. wish it was better for multiples,"I love the ovia app so much, out of all the ones I tried I love the daily updates and insights! the only thing I wish is that it worked better for multiples. I am currently pregnant with twins & I wish once you made the selection for twins on the app that it would have the daily updates correlate with that."

Great articles, daily updates, tracking methods for your diet and medications or etc, food safety (which was huge for me in the beginning), and soooo much more. I tell everyone newly pregnant to download. It guides you so much on your new found journey!!"
480,480,1,2017-11-08T18:25:48.000Z,Xena1080,Not useful,"Some people write questions that have nothing to do with being pregnant and all you can do is ""flag as inappropriate"". The same for some answers within questions: you flag them, they disappear but when you reenter the thread, they are there again. Poor layout. Constant adds. The food and medication lookups are not accurate. You click on BLT and it says you shouldn't eat it because of the cold cuts--since when are cold cuts in a BLT? But it's in red, so don't eat it people! Smh I don't recommend this app to anyone, there are others that are better."
481,481,5,2018-02-22T03:44:58.000Z,Miranda2591,Love!,"I absolutely love this app! My mom and hubby have it downloaded too so that they can keep up with everything too. My only small complaint is that it takes forever to save something like a milestone. I don't think it's my internet connection because it's like that everywhere I go. But other than that, it's perfect!"
482,482,5,2019-04-11T06:17:50.000Z,mallularoe,Couldn’t be happier!,"I am amazed at how many details you can keep track of in this app! Extremely impressed and I’ve been using it since the beginning of my pregnancy (27 weeks now) Before finding this app, I was using the Ovia  Fertility App. I hope to find that there’s an all year round cycle app to use after pregnancy as well."
483,483,5,2021-03-13T14:37:31.000Z,csyrce,Very Cute Tracker,"I enjoy being able to set up cute themes such as backgrounds, colors, and different categories to measure babies growth. Been using this for both of my pregnancies. I also really like that you’re able to log appointments and it reminds you to track taking your vitamins. Overall an easy app to navigate."
484,484,5,2020-11-26T14:36:23.000Z,hajidixj,Great app,Love this app! I wish I would have found this app sooner! I didn’t discover it until my 3rd trimester but will definitely be using it for my next pregnancy!
485,485,5,2020-07-26T23:52:37.000Z,snapdunn,Best overall,"I am currently using two pregnancy apps. This one and WhattoExpect. I love being able to track my symptoms, health, weight, etc. I like being able to quickly read reliable info about symptoms, medications and foods. The only reason I also use the WhatToExpwxt app is because the community boards are better. Great app."
486,486,5,2020-03-11T19:39:06.000Z,RecentMommy,Useful Handy guide,"This is such a great app. I love the daily updates and seeing how my baby was growing. The app is a great resource for general queries one has as you go through pregnancy like safe foods to eat, medical conditions during pregnancy etc. it’s a very useful handy guide. I like that they have partnered with service providers like cord blood banking providers and give discounts to Ovia users."
487,487,5,2019-12-01T07:58:29.000Z,Happy me always,Must have pregnancy and postpartum app,I love this app. I am so glad that I downloaded this app as soon as I found out that I was pregnant. This app kept me aware of the different stages of my pregnancy and also a few dos and donts during the pregnancy. It’s an easy to understand and navigate app. I love love love this app. Job well done to the people involved in creating and managing this app!!!
488,488,5,2019-09-06T01:00:41.000Z,jerhan88,The BEST one out there!!!,"When I first found out I was pregnant I downloaded every free pregnancy tracker app, I am now 38 weeks and it is the only one I use. I absolutely love all of the setting and it has reminded me soooo many times to take my prenatal vitamins!! If you’re pregnant it’s really the only app you need. It’s super easy to use and has such cool little rid bits daily!!"
489,489,2,2019-11-26T03:08:24.000Z,newmama0720,If you want to be advertised to...,"I found this app pretty annoying. Condescending gold stars, invasive quizzes, odd advice, constant ads, (Zumba? It must be sponsored), and was enrolled in unwanted emails without my consent. The contraction timer and kick counter seem useful but I’m not willing to put up with this for a few days of convenience at the end of the pregnancy, especially when there are better apps out there. Also there’s in an in-app button to “give this app 5 stars!” which is why I suspect the app ratings are inflated."
490,490,4,2018-01-22T03:32:39.000Z,Flawrida,"Great,cute app!","Great app for moms to be. Super cute updates on how big baby is on week to week. It has great articles to read about lifestyle, health , nutrition and even what to expect with baby. Overall the app is very cute and informational especially with its food and medication safety lookup which is helpful. Also it helps to read the posts made by moms daily as it can answer some of your own doubts or questions."
491,491,5,2018-04-07T14:49:06.000Z,123453-/44,Love it!,I used Ovia fertility when my husband and I decided to try and have a baby. We got pregnant in two months! I’ve been using ovia pregnancy my whole pregnancy and I love it. The only problem I have with it is the weekly videos. You don’t get to see what the baby might look like from the inside and that’s something I’m very curious about.
492,492,5,2018-06-05T12:40:02.000Z,Feb32019,😍,I really love this app. It gives you all the information you need day by day as you go through your pregnancy. From a community forum to ask other women questions about there process and the best part is the food look up section. It tells you what foods you can eat or shouldn’t eat!! I totally recommend this app!!
493,493,5,2018-07-25T02:10:16.000Z,Heather lamb,Great app,I enjoyed this app during my pregnancy. I found it to be less flashy and less complicated than other apps for pregnancy. It helped me stay excited about being pregnant when I was very sick in the first trimester and I loved seeing the different animals or items as we grew. I would definitely use this one again!
494,494,5,2018-08-23T16:13:41.000Z,kennat_16,Love!,"When i found out i was pregnant i downloaded this app and have been hooked! it gave me the exact date i would be due and my doctor gave me the exact one as well! i love the animation of what you baby looks like each week, it melts my heart! it also gives you good info on how to make your pregnancy go smoother. 110% recommend!"
495,495,5,2018-10-05T17:04:00.000Z,november 19 due date,I love this app !!!!,I love this app!! Very helpful and has a lot of information . This is my third child and I still found out new things as if I was a first time mom . Excellent app. I had the ovulation app at first which helped me get pregnant and than I downloaded this app to keep track of my pregnancy ! 5 stars I am so happy I downloaded this app. Great job team
496,496,5,2018-12-09T16:06:18.000Z,me091219,Great app,This is app is wonderful . It follows you every step of the way and has lots of articles and videos and gives updates daily on what you can expect to happen or could already be happening. Has lots of other helpful tools as well as tracking your weight and food and exercise.
497,497,5,2021-03-19T15:29:20.000Z,KTapp03,Great app!!!,"I used this app while pregnant with my first child and was very happy with the wealth of information available, the ability to track symptoms and add notes (especially sense I was worried I would forget questions for the doctor between visits early on). I also recommend Ovia to everyone trying or expecting"
498,498,5,2020-12-18T23:51:45.000Z,Aggielauren09,Great pregnancy app!,"I used this app during three of my pregnancies, and I love it! The information is excellent, even when you’ve been through it a few times. I also really liked that you can choose different themes for baby’s size each week, though the French bakery theme made me crave pastries more than once! 😂"
499,499,1,2021-02-12T17:40:06.000Z,Ack5887,Disappointing,"With all the controversy over Covid-19 and the rapid vaccination rollout, the push in the feed to get the vaccination and saying that it is safe when there are many pregnant patients who have received and miscarried within 2 days to a week after receiving the vaccination. Extremely sensitive topic and not enough known to be making recommendations. I also saw the flu vaccine info in the settings/account tab. These suggestions have made me question the information and recommendations in this app. I will be deleting it after using it for two of my pregnancies!"
500,500,5,2017-10-19T10:22:21.000Z,shortymartinezbabe13,Amazing!,"Okay listen ! I love this app, it’s very helpful ❤️ The people that made this app should really add a “ tag along “ or “ follow” button to the question section because I see a lot of us can relate to questions other ask as well. Also , when you ask a question, I would like to have a notification sound."
501,501,1,2017-11-04T15:37:53.000Z,Woo loop,Unable to use due to complicated features,"I ovulated late in my cycle which caused me to be 2 weeks off on my due date. My ultrasound dating confirmed the actual pregnancy age. I tried to update this on the app to reflect my doctor determined due date and date of conception but the app confined to make its own adjustments. It made my period a week later, due date a week earlier, etc and so on. Very frustrating especially when I know when my period started that month but the ovulation was just off. I will be finding a new app that is not so restrictive on dates."
502,502,2,2018-03-03T04:06:47.000Z,April Baby Momma,Loved the app ... until recently,"In the past month or so every time I try and open the app it looks like it’s going to open and then closes. This afternoon I tried getting in for 2.5 hours before it finally opened. It’s very frustrating, especially since I had a doctor appt today and couldn’t get to the questions i had been saving in this app."
503,503,5,2018-08-12T09:45:35.000Z,jeenov,Super Easy and fun !,"Ovia won by a landslide compared to other apps. it’s extremely easy to use and comprehensive when explaining what to expect from you and your baby. i also love that it has its own food and medication lookup! The fun customizations are super fun and it’s great being able to track every symptom, food ingestion and health care visit."
504,504,5,2018-08-21T14:06:39.000Z,CommGalPhD,Fun and helpful app!,"My sister recommended Ovia and I am so glad I downloaded it! I appreciate the well written, informative and timely articles. Love the updates on how our baby is developing. The reminders on prenatal vitamins,eating healthy and staying active are great. Love the tracking features too. I am involved in app design professionally and think Ovia’s UX is fantastic! Keep it up! :)"
505,505,5,2019-02-01T08:11:55.000Z,Mrsmasters.,Amazing,"I absolutely love this app. It has everything you could need and gives you new info everyday on your growing baby. It even has a symptom look up tool, and a medication safety look up tool. How awesome is that? And the mom group is 100% anonymous so don’t be nervous to ask whatever you need! Definitely my #1 rated pregnancy app."
506,506,5,2021-03-11T17:11:45.000Z,nephDan,Great App,"By far one of the easiest pregnancy apps to work with. I love all of the features and little reminders that it offers. When I found out I was pregnant, I immediately downloaded the app and was able to see how far along I was based on the info I provided and since then it has helped to demystify a lot of fears."
507,507,5,2021-01-14T20:07:33.000Z,Halmarber,Amazing!,I love all the information this app provides each week. I’m pregnant with my second child and love being able to show my first child the progress the baby is making. This app has so much beneficial information all in one place! It is also extremely easy to navigate.
508,508,5,2020-03-07T14:52:58.000Z,CieMichelle,About To Be a Grandmom,"When my daughter first told me that she was pregnant I thought she was joking... whelp, here we are 9 months later with 3 wks to go “yay!!!”  I searched for good pregnancy apps and came across “Ovia”. The best app by far! They kept record of my daughter’s pregnancy, gave much needed information and great advice. This is an excellent app especially for first tim mothers!! I highly recommend it ☺️"
509,509,5,2020-01-23T15:42:02.000Z,ashland97,Best pregnancy app!,I used 3 different pregnancy apps and this one by far was the best! It was so informative and I loved that it kept track of my symptoms and even gave tips on how to help those symptoms. I will 100 percent use with my next pregnancy. All my other mama friends I recommended it to also said they loved the app and made their pregnancy so much easier.
510,510,5,2017-11-18T02:40:35.000Z,torinatalia,"Honestly love it, I’m not just saying that!","This app is more enjoyable to visit then any of my other pregnancy apps, and I have 4 total! It’s colorful, interactive, entertaining, and it helps me keep track of so much information I would otherwise forget! I even input my insurance information and it tells me what i qualify for, how awesome! I love this thing."
511,511,5,2017-11-19T05:31:02.000Z,Hhahahhahahahahahah,Love this app,"I used this app with my first pregnancy and now with my second. I love this app, especially the references to your baby's size every week. It has tons of great information, products, and helpful hints that can be productive to your pregnancy. Also one of the easiest pregnancy apps I have ever used. Would definitely recommend it."
512,512,5,2021-03-30T18:44:24.000Z,newmomma newlife,Everything and more,"First time being pregnant this app has been so insightful and easy to track my journey. It so user friendly and I love all the different articles, daily updates, chances to get free stuff, and the supportive community where we can safely ask questions and learn from one another."
513,513,5,2021-03-12T15:52:57.000Z,CBMV2021,First time mom!,"Really good for a first time mom! It is good to have a easy way to track my weight, the size of baby, and the mule stones. It gives you articles that, to me, are like guidance help me with general info. Things I never heard before, I read on the app and then did my research in parallel to take decisions. I would highly recommend it."
514,514,5,2021-01-15T22:26:32.000Z,marinefrau,Best app tracker,I love this app. I’m on my second pregnancy and I’ve been using this from the beginning. It has helped me to better understand what’s going on the second time around and I’ve had fun with the new vegetables that come up each week! Definitely recommend for new mom or second time/third time moms
515,515,5,2020-12-31T16:03:20.000Z,AshConz,My favorite and I’ve tried a lot,"I love the interface of this app, it gives me just the right amount of information without being redundant or generic. I love the images of the baby’s size. It really helps me to feel connected especially because we are growing our family via surrogacy"
516,516,5,2020-05-19T02:11:46.000Z,leeoverby,Only App I Use!,"This is the only app I’ve used, and this is my 2nd pregnancy! I’ve downloaded other apps and they don’t satisfy me as quite as this one lol. Definitely recommend! I love the little picture and how big they’re getting. It makes me excited opening the app up each week to see how big my baby grew."
517,517,5,2020-05-12T11:10:50.000Z,la12ab34,Helpful,Helpful content like food and medication look up sections and a calendar. Less of the fluffy articles you’d find on the bump etc so it may not be the type of thing you check daily but way more helpful to look ahead to see how many weeks you’d be at a future date etc
518,518,4,2019-07-06T13:09:07.000Z,Aes16,Blood Sugar,"Love everything about this app, and I’m now using it again for my second pregnancy. I would like to be able to track my blood sugar within the app. Right now I have to use a separate app. I would also love to be able to compare symptoms timelines from my 1st pregnancy, because right now I just have to scroll back 3 years through the calendar!"
519,519,2,2019-11-01T12:37:21.000Z,oncloudeason,Fix the bugs!,"I love this app! I'm 8 weeks pregnant and using Ovia to track my every symptom, talk to the anonymous community, and check on baby's progress. Also used Ovia Fertility app Prior to this. However I have never been able to use the ""In The Womb"" feature because the app freezes every time you click on it. I just updated the app hoping it would fix that and now my entire app freezes upon opening so I can no longer use it at all! Help, I don't want to go elsewhere."
520,520,5,2017-12-26T03:53:35.000Z,Babygurl231808,Love it,"I absolutely love Ovia pregnancy and I recommend it to anyone who’s pregnant!! Every day they tell you a little about your baby’s development and also any body changes your body might be experimenting that week, it usually is on point with it as well. I first used Ovia fertility and once I got pregnant I was so happy to know they had one for pregnancy."
521,521,3,2018-04-01T05:14:43.000Z,AnonymousrandomName1234,"Great app, but has a few glitches!","The app is very informative and easy to use, I love it! However, lately when I try to open the app, it loads for 30 or so seconds and then closes itself. Sometimes I try a good 6 times before I finally give up and hope that the next time I try to use it, it will work. I think that's an issue that should be fixed; it's getting VERY frustrating! Otherwise, it's a great app!"
522,522,5,2018-08-21T15:38:48.000Z,Ashashelyoliver,Love the app so much,"This app helped me when I was wasn’t sure I was doing anything right with my pregnancy. I was able to also see what I wasn’t supposed to eat during pregnancy and what was safe to eat. I also love the countdown. Everyday I would get excited just looking at it! For all you pregnant women, get this app! It’s great to have ❤️"
523,523,5,2019-01-06T13:45:02.000Z,Fsuseminole,Favorite Pregnancy App,"This is my first baby so I downloaded over six different pregnancy apps and Ovia is by far my favorite! I personally love watching the special week by week videos explaining baby’s growth by one of Ovia’s employees who is also pregnant, it just adds a personal touch which I look forward to every week as my baby grows! Thank you Ovia!"
524,524,5,2019-02-06T02:31:40.000Z,TeenMomofTwoUnderTwo,Great Source of Information,"With my first pregnancy I used a different app, this time around I chose to go a different app. I love that I’m able to look up all the things I would have questions about, track my moods, medications, what I’ve ate/drank, my weight and more. I love it. Definitely will recommend to my other pregnant friends"
525,525,5,2019-03-18T22:12:39.000Z,heyystina,Great app,I’ve used this app since finding out I’m pregnant and enjoy all of the information and features it provides. The interface for tracking food and appointments is easy to use and the feature for choosing the likeness in size of your baby is fun and interesting. Great app and I would recommend!
526,526,5,2019-06-15T15:29:20.000Z,lionelmom,Very helpful,Ovia apps have been very helpful during my pregnancy. We used Ovia fertility app to see my fertility forecast. We got pregnant within a month. I then downloaded Ovia pregnancy during my pregnancy and it has been very useful. It has everything from the develop of the baby to kick counter and contraction counter. Very helpful. Love it! Thanks for this app!
527,527,5,2021-03-11T23:50:17.000Z,megmarieg,Love love love,If I’m ever pregnant again I will definitely be using this app. It has everything you need in it from videos on what’s happening in all the weeks to birthing stories and ideas. My favorite part is how it shows the little hand and foot growing every week with you. It’s amazing and makes me feel at peace.
528,528,3,2021-04-19T15:34:35.000Z,Janrob237332,It’s OK,The tracking and calendar is not that simple to fill out and there is a lot of information I am not tracking that bogs it down.  Also the categories / references for how big the baby is are kind of random and strange.  I honestly downloaded it and have barely used it.  I liked my period app better (Flo).  Also there is really no discussion / community area.  It is just polls which are not very helpful.  I would look elsewhere
529,529,5,2021-03-10T17:36:37.000Z,A.Downs,This app was very informational,I loved this app and can’t wait to use it again. I loved see week by week of how big the baby was and all the information it gave during that time. It was fun to change the comparisons to see how big baby is.  I would definitely recommend this app to anyone!
530,530,2,2018-03-10T03:10:08.000Z,CigarSmokingDog,Please inform people about health assessment,"It’s very disingenuous of you to ask women to fill out the ‘quick’ health assessment saying they will get ‘access more personalized health alerts, and education surrounding your unique pregnancy’ only to then see that everything is locked behind a paywall or employer benefit program.  You basically took all my information and ran.  Shame on you.  Tell people up front that you have to pay to access the information BEFORE they fill out the questionnaire."
531,531,4,2018-05-29T05:12:50.000Z,beckyenger1,Contraction Counter Thoughts,I have loved this app but I do have one suggestion. Sometimes my contractions are so strong or are keeping me up late at night that I forget to click done. Or I select the wrong intensity level. I like how I can delete a contraction but I would love to be able to edit it as well.
532,532,5,2020-12-28T12:33:32.000Z,Heartbeats33,Such a great app..but,"The app is beyond amazing! Me and my husband love it. It’s been a great way to keep track of our growing baby. BUT the app does log me out from time to time, and when I put in my login information it says “your session has expired login”. That’s the only flaw with this app, besides that we are still very satisfied"
533,533,4,2021-01-22T20:50:53.000Z,Qtmom2B,I Love This App- First Time Mom,I love how it provides you with detail information on your baby; and also networks with other resources to provide you with more information in other fields. Everyday I send updates to the hubby about our little one! I like how it sets reminders to take your vitamins and how it allows you to keep track of your symptoms.. I’m enjoying it so far...
534,534,5,2021-03-10T15:14:36.000Z,Jetters88,Best Pregnancy App,This app was such a great tool to have during my pregnancy! I loved being able to see my baby’s development in the womb by each week. It was fun to be able to visualize how big he was by the fun pictures. It also was a great tool for my health and knowing what I needed to get ready for my baby’s birth and coming home.
535,535,5,2021-01-25T07:50:50.000Z,Steveland Morris,I love this app!,For the first time with my first child this app made it so easy for me to stay organized and up to date with myself during pregnancy. I’m able to track how far along my unborn child is developing and made it very exciting for me to count the days until I can finally meet my baby!
536,536,5,2021-01-22T19:32:27.000Z,newmommy21,I love this pregnancy app!,This is my first pregnancy and Ovia has been extremely helpful. It lets me know how baby is doing and what’s to come next. It even lets me know how I should be feeling and the changes my body is going through. It’s very educational and helps SO much. Every week I look forward to an update on my pregnancy.😊
537,537,5,2021-01-12T00:06:29.000Z,Megan M. Boyter,The best app with everything in one !,I love that you don’t have to buy everything to find out what is going on and how big the baby is at the time. I also love that this app has the calendars with your weeks on each week and most it only gives you one week at a time.
538,538,5,2020-08-09T04:08:00.000Z,AnubisoftheGods,Very helpful and informative,"This is by far my favorite app. Being in the military and who has been deployed, on top of that a new father-to-be. This app helped me keep track of the progress of my wife and my baby girl. Has a lot of great tips and info  for modern day pregnancy and health guide. We will continueto use  this app with our future kids."
539,539,3,2019-09-26T21:29:39.000Z,Meg's Momma,Glitchy since this most recent update,This app was perfect for me... until this last update. All of a sudden it closes without warning or without actually opening at all. The loading time to enter information has gotten longer as well. I honestly enjoyed this app the most out of all the ones I tried for tracking everything with my pregnancy but now it’s frustrating me.
540,540,5,2017-10-03T01:50:47.000Z,Kim21smart,Best of the baby trackers,I have used the other apps in the past and have them currently but Ovia is the most versatile. There is so much to do and read. We love the fun size measurements each week. And the weekly video really makes you feel like you are part of a group rather than just tracking. Thanks!
541,541,5,2017-10-12T02:55:43.000Z,Bliss1009,Favorite pregnancy app,"Ovia is one of my favorite apps. It has man features that are free and I love how you can select themes and add your baby's name on the profile, gives it a personal touch. The app has never crashed on me which is great. I look forward to reading updates everyday in the app. I will"

It’s great to see what all is going on I do wish it would list more medicines that are and aren’t safe, and also I would like to see more on the home page of how my baby is doing. Overall it’s a great app and I love it. I check it aleast once a day! I never downloaded an app with my son but I did with this pregnancy because a friend recommended it! ❤️❤️"

Im downloading the parenting app now since I am 37 weeks and about to become a mama. I highly recommend. It helps you keep up with everything. I love tracking milestones, seeing my baby’s development each week and I love the community as well!! The best :)"
544,544,5,2018-11-02T14:01:16.000Z,Rmaguire08,Love this app,"This app makes tracking the pregnancy fun, exciting and so informative. You get to nickname your growing baby and can learn pretty much anything you need to know about pregnancy. Something else I really admire is the information they post or blog about all comes from very credible sources. I’m a stickler on where I get my information."
545,545,5,2019-05-02T03:08:27.000Z,Ness Flowers,Best app!,I’ve been using this app since the day after I got my positive result! I downloaded Ovia and two others but kept this one and use it daily because of all the fun facts and unique ways to keep track of my data! I definitely recommend this app to all my fellow pregnant friends and family!
546,546,1,2019-09-03T03:56:23.000Z,aplcinamn,Baby size,"It has some neat features but slow to load and too many extra things. But the reason I finally just deleted it was because of the comparisons of things to the size of your baby. They were ridiculous! First, there’s too much variety in fruits and vegetables to compare them to a baby. The French bakery thing was cute, but not practical. The toy version wasn’t specific enough and weird animals not relatable."
547,547,1,2021-05-26T14:40:49.000Z,patrariggins,Wish app worked,"I got this app when I first found out I was pregnant, but somewhere around five months the app just logged me out and hasn’t"
548,548,4,2021-01-27T17:30:50.000Z,Oh-live-ee-uh,Was glad to find this app,So helpful during my second pregnancy! Wish I had during my first. Has similar features between the apps and was so easy to use and track everything. Was glad for all the aspects and handy tools to keep up with my pregnancy! I loved the different theme choices and the “your baby is this size now” was so fun!
549,549,4,2021-01-14T18:34:06.000Z,BabyAyala2021,New to this,This app is great! I love that it calculates your due date even if you are only 2 weeks pregnant! I was 5 weeks when I found out and because of this app I have an idea of a due date being it is too early for my doctor to give me one. I love that they refer the size of baby from animals to funny but cute things .. 💖💙 definitely a must download!
550,550,3,2017-09-18T09:32:44.000Z,Cammyj00,Fine,"Not going to lie, I use this app just to see which funny little animal matches my baby's size each week. I otherwise don't see this as standing out from any other baby app. This one will tell you little tidbits of info on what's happening with your baby each day, but only while scrolling past tons of ads (ads for products and ads for themselves- ""Rate us 5 Stars"" or ""Share this app with a friend""!)."
551,551,5,2018-01-17T16:48:04.000Z,MaxwellClanBabies,Round two!,"I used Ovia fertility and then pregnancy with our first son. Now that I’m pregnant again I am without question using it for this baby. So much great information and videos. I like the fact there is no pop culture garbage like which celebrities are having babies. I also love the food and medicine look up, so helpful!"
552,552,5,2018-01-20T16:43:49.000Z,Heather rath,Love this app!,I absolutely love this app as well as both of my young children. We enjoy seeing the new Info each week regarding our growing baby. I did however have an issue with the app but contacted customer service and they helped me fix my issue right away. Thanks for having such an amazing app.
553,553,5,2018-04-16T11:30:43.000Z,lvhay4,Creative and informative,I love this app - it is the most creative I have ever seen in terms of “baby size” and I always look forward to checking and sharing with friends and family each week.  The food safety lookup was helpful in my first trimester and there are a lot of great articles.  Very informational for a first timer!
554,554,3,2018-04-17T16:27:08.000Z,lovemyfrenchies89,Ovia,I like this app it has some great features but I was disappointed it didn’t have more options for other issues during pregnancy. I have placenta acreata and was hoping to add it but they only seem to have placenta previa. With placenta acreata you deliver sooner so I’d like to see that option on the app so I don’t have to do the calculations all the time on how many weeks I have left.  Also the app is a little difficult to navigate.
555,555,5,2018-07-03T10:31:44.000Z,svg17,Best App Ever,I had been using the fertility app that Ovia had- and when I was able to conceive (just 5 months later!!!) I switched over to the pregnancy app they have. I’m only 5 weeks along but I can already tell how helpful all the articles will be along my pregnancy and all the awesome tips are extremely helpful!
556,556,5,2021-07-22T18:22:16.000Z,Ejlhotka,Love,This app is far the best app for tracking pregnancy and I also like the ovulation app through the same company because you track your ovulation on the other app once you can see if it switches all your information over to the pregnancy app which is phenomenal keep up the good work thanks
557,557,5,2021-03-30T19:24:00.000Z,Itsstephy,LOVE,"I love this app especially the little gadgets it has, makes me see how big my baby is growing in fruit sizes LOL also gives daily updates Im able to put my doctors appointments on here that way I never forget, gives me a lot of information on a daily basis on everything I need to know about pregnancy! I love this app !"
558,558,5,2020-12-19T17:36:32.000Z,Absolutely Loving This,Makes Pregnancy Journey Easier,"The pregnancy app is nothing short of amazing! All of the daily insights and resources are phenomenal! Especially with this being my first pregnancy and not being able to see my doctor for almost the entire first trimester, Ovia has been such a great tool! Couldn’t do this without it!"
559,559,1,2020-12-26T21:25:55.000Z,Angie8888,Can’t use app all of a sudden,"I’ve been using the app for a couple months now and it was working fine. A couple days ago I went to use and all of a sudden I’m getting a message saying my iPhone is not compatible with their high security standards...I’m confused because I used the app in the morning and started getting that message in the afternoon. I’ve tried to delete the app and reinstall, restarting my phone, updates and nothing is working. Yet I still get the emails everyday to track progress in the app 🙄"
560,560,5,2018-02-26T03:02:52.000Z,Peaceful nights sleep,Love,I absolutely love this app. I started off with another one but I didn’t like how I really couldn’t put any information on it. This app lets me record everything. I check it at least 3 times a day to read what’s new. I love how it compares the size of the baby to certain stuff. This app is simply amazing. I love it.
561,561,5,2018-04-12T23:16:24.000Z,surggal,My peanut,I absolutely love this app!!everything about it is awesome I love the little articles that they give you to read they’re easy to read short and to the point I also love that you get to nickname your baby and it says his and her until we know what it is just such a awesome app I suggest you get it!
562,562,5,2018-05-28T14:29:37.000Z,anitwin,Good pregnancy app,I find this app helpful during my pregnancy. I like how it tells me how big my baby’s hands and feet are every week. It is not too pushy but gives you all the information you need. I decided for the veggie/fruit version since the animals are just a little too weird for me and my husband haha.
563,563,5,2018-08-19T01:17:07.000Z,kaysminiReese's,Love this pregnancy app,The best app for keeping up with your pregnancy. It’s well organized and very easy to use. Super informative and helpful. Offers tons of tools to use like food safety look up and medicine look ups. Has charts to track your weight and blood pressure. It’s just a great app all around definitely give it a download.
564,564,5,2018-08-26T14:53:15.000Z,Traci131313,Love this app,This app has been used for 2 of my pregnancies now.   Crazy enough both of those have been within 14 months of each other! So I am grateful for the fun facts and weekly updates on how my little buns do and what they are growing week by week.  Highly recommend this app to all the new moms.  Good luck!
565,565,4,2018-11-26T04:00:12.000Z,Pinterest lust,Great pregnancy app,I love this pregnancy app. It makes it fun and I really love watching the weekly video as she recaps most of what you end up reading for the week. The one thing I think ovia needs is a baby bump picture section where you can take a weekly picture and turn it into a time lapse video at the end of your pregnancy to watch your pregnancy progress over time :)
566,566,5,2019-03-17T03:14:44.000Z,Syruuuuup,Love It,"As soon as I found out i was pregnant, I downloaded several apps. This one I really liked. I love the fact that they give you daily updates and have informational videos. They also interact with the user by tracking several things such as mood/feelings, symptoms, taking vitamins and weight."
567,567,5,2020-09-22T10:31:03.000Z,Jeifor,Everything you need to know!!,"I love this app, is so much information you will be able to have, specially If is your first child!! honestly every question, doubt, symptom or even a curiosity was here! I really feel connected with other mothers who were in the same condition as me at that time! 💕"
568,568,5,2019-11-03T06:16:20.000Z,rsmithmama,Best pregnancy app,This app is AMAZING! It gives me updates on the size of the baby and it is so fun to go through and read what things should be happening with the baby and things that should be developing. It also goes through possible symptoms that I may be experiencing. Overall this app is super informative and I love it
569,569,1,2020-01-09T11:58:28.000Z,MDEVo_,Privacy issues,"I liked the app and the updates that I would receive. Recently, however, I denied them access to my photos but, somehow, they were able override that. I checked my settings to confirm that  “never” was still selected for photos and it was! In a time where our privacy is constantly violated, I did not appreciate that. May seem small to some, but if they’re overriding our settings and preferences to access photos, who knows what else they’re accessing without our permission. Be careful!"
570,570,5,2017-11-20T10:06:34.000Z,Tiffie2006,Neat app,This is a neat app that gives you great updates on baby's development as well as interesting articles. You can change the theme from fruits and veggies to animals and more. You can also track appointments and medical information. I would definitely recommend using this app during pregnancy.
571,571,5,2018-08-04T19:05:58.000Z,Pookiee Smith,Great App 👍🏽,"I love The Ovia App 😍💯 almost everyday at different times I get informed about my baby’s movements and how she’s doing week to week and day by day. It’s filled with so much information about the baby and how moms are doing . It’s always better to know than to wonder,  that’s why this app gets a five ⭐️ rating from me !!! Thank you 😊"
572,572,3,2019-01-14T12:56:14.000Z,Chon P,"Was great when I first found out I was pregnant, but now....","As soon as you are at the end of second trimester, the app just sends you the same notifications over and over again. “The baby is practicing breathing in the womb” I received this one a billion times! Lol at the beginning it was something different everyday. Maybe whoever sends out the notifications are running out of valuable information."
573,573,5,2019-03-03T16:51:55.000Z,LastWeeksOfPregnancy,So informative!,I loved reading my weekly updates and the little tips throughout the day during my pregnancy! I especially loved how easy it was to share the information through texting to my husband and family! It kept us all informed and excited for baby’s arrival!
574,574,5,2019-04-22T15:43:01.000Z,MissyMayhem21,Fun app while pregnant/post pregnancy,"Ovia app was a lot of fun during my pregnancy learning about my daughters growth, what I could be expecting, and letting me track everything along the way. I still use it post pregnancy to learn about things for my daughter in her development. Easy to use. No glitching. Just a overall fun educational app."
575,575,5,2021-07-08T03:58:11.000Z,TayLynn x23,Thankful for this app!,"This is my first pregnancy and this app has helped me in so many ways! I’ve learned things that I didn’t know even happened/exists, I loved following my baby’s size and what was new in the start of a week. I will be trying OviaParenting when my baby is born. Just to try it out."
576,576,5,2021-01-24T13:32:22.000Z,Kisses47467,Ovia helps a lot,I’ve been using Ovia since I was pregnant. And that was almost 3 years ago. I’m a first time mom and don’t know the slightest thing about parenting. We lead busy lives and I don’t have lots of time to read books. The tips they send are short and easily digestible. I highly recommend this app
577,577,5,2020-12-08T11:14:29.000Z,blessedFMB,Excited!,This app gives me so much information about my growing baby and my health. And just being able to track everything flawlessly is amazing! The app that i was using previously gave me incorrect information on the gestation of my growing baby and this app has been spot on!
578,578,5,2020-05-02T08:16:54.000Z,Jake and Sarah Busler,Perfect (for now),Just got this app so could be prematurely but I’ve downloaded five apps already and this is the only one that provides everything I’m looking for in one place. The articles are trustworthy and the community forum to ask anonymous questions is amazing if you’re stressing yourself out!
579,579,3,2019-07-24T16:30:19.000Z,i was scammmmmed,"A good one, but not representative of non white people","One of the better apps but not the best, I switched to “pregnancy+” which you can choose skin tones on and a much better art with the weekly visuals (as a midwife that was important to me), i deleted it the day it compared my kid to a white “fashion Barbie doll - but much pinker!” - just came off super weird."
580,580,5,2017-10-01T19:51:48.000Z,Housewife247,Baby number 2,I love this app I love that there is regular updates every few weeks. It would be nice if with the next update you could include the feature of putting in getting your cervix checked how far dilated you are and stuff like that. Include some info with that info as well.
581,581,1,2017-10-13T01:10:36.000Z,Aliviaaaa,Wow,"Got so tired of the app crashing every time I opened it (it was to the point where I couldn't even use it at all anymore) that I finally just deleted the app and downloaded it, hoping that would help. I figured since I have an ""account"" my information would be saved. Wrong..everything gone..saved absolutely nothing not even my name! What's the point of having an account. I loved this app before it started crashing so much, been using it this whole time and I'm 32 weeks!! Please fix these problems:("
582,582,5,2018-04-07T05:22:07.000Z,vickchick98,Ovia Pregnancy,This is a very good app! Used it all the way thru my pregnancy. Good at showing size comparison and giving good and accurate information. After you have your child it tracks how old they are and gives info based on that like when they start smiling and so on. Highly recommended app!
583,583,5,2018-07-24T14:56:01.000Z,Kmm111009,Best pregnancy app ♥️,"I went through probably 6 pregnancy apps and they all sucked but then I came across Ovia in a mom group(I’m kicked out of now 😂) and it’s the best! It updates you everyday and you can change the app from fruit, action figures and I can’t remember the other one. I think it’s animals 🤷🏼‍♀️ anyway, it’s the best!"
584,584,5,2019-04-16T06:30:12.000Z,Loliviasan,My favorite pregnancy tracker!,Just about 2 weeks ago I found out I'm expecting. And immediately downloaded all the pregnancy apps that I could find. And I can honestly say I deleted them all and stayed with Ovia. It has everything! My favorite feature is the daily newsfeed comments!
585,585,5,2021-01-23T05:31:02.000Z,katchieT,Should be your 1st go to app for pregnancy,I was pregnant for a few weeks so I didn’t get to use this for a whole pregnancy due to my miscarriage but I tried so many apps and still love Ovia. They make logging information so easy and thought of everything you need to stay informed for your pregnancy.
586,586,5,2020-01-14T13:59:26.000Z,VampyreMD,Love This App!!!,"This is my fourth child, so I’m pretty busy, but I wanted an app that would allow me to log everything and provide information about the progress of my pregnancy. I tried 4 or 5 apps total. I went to another one after Ovia, but ended up deleting it and coming back. It’s really awesome!"
587,587,5,2019-07-04T03:09:31.000Z,mrs.wallsmith,Love this app!,It’s by far my favorite app but I would appreciate it if I could clear my inbox on the community part with one button instead of individually. It would also be nice to “Like” a comment on a thread that I think is helpful so others can see how many people find it helpful.
588,588,5,2021-03-24T13:23:43.000Z,iallymaz,Very useful,This APP has helped me keep track of my pregnancy.. not only what baby is doing but what mom needs to expect week bu week as well. The app allows you to track personal symptoms and doctor appointments. I love the cartoon and lifelike pictures of the baby in womb that are provided. Highly recommend this app.
589,589,5,2021-03-19T08:26:11.000Z,ariahand,Best pregnancy app!,"The best pregnancy app ever!! I was successful with two babies after using the app!! And it’s super easy to use! It even helps me track my periods & symptoms, so when I go to the doctor office & they ask me when my first day of last period was, I can easily notify them without having to remember!"
590,590,5,2017-12-17T23:06:59.000Z,Tcobb82,Love this app,I’d never heard of this app before I stumbled across it on FB and decided to give it a try. It’s one of my favorite pregnancy apps. Love the articles on relevant topics that I’m facing in my pregnant. Love the icons on how big my little ones feet and hands would be. I really look forward to the update each week. Love it. Thank you.
591,591,5,2018-01-17T14:32:19.000Z,Chelle4273,Love,As a first time mom I love this app EVERY symptom I’ve had either that night or next day it would pop up saying it was possible to have this and that symptom and sure enough it would be something I was feeling or felt. I’m 23 weeks now and it has been w me every step of the way! I love it!
592,592,5,2018-05-21T00:06:37.000Z,Breanna McNiel,More pros using this than cons :),Pros is it keeps track of how far along you are and it just makes me smile my baby is the size of a Batman action figure
593,593,3,2019-01-01T18:34:14.000Z,Hungry432,Be careful with second pregnancies,I had intended to surprise my husband with our second pregnancy and instead he got an email from Ovia with a tracker update on due date and a countdown to how much time is left til birth - surprise ruined.
594,594,5,2019-04-22T19:33:07.000Z,TTTTTTorrie,This app is incredible,"From the time of conception (thanks to the Ovia app) I was transferred over to the Ovia pregnancy app and have felt so at ease. The app is simple to use, provides useful information in a non-overwhelming way and has made it very easy to track how I am doing during this pregnancy. I highly recommend it!"
595,595,1,2019-05-29T18:21:31.000Z,KstarBird11,Ovia sells your information,"Ovia sells your medical data and anything else you track or enter into the app. This also goes for Ovia fertility. There is an article about it in the Washington post. Ovia will sell your information to your employer if your employer chooses to pay and pursue it. The app is fine but don’t believe for a second that the people who work for Ovia care about your privacy or support mothers. We already have enough adversity in the workforce and, in the US, with unpaid leave. It’s unfortunate that Ovia perpetuates this by sharing private information."
596,596,5,2020-12-28T19:28:05.000Z,MirnaJB,Very easy to Navigate,I love how simple and easy this platform was to navigate. It was very informative using this as a first time mom and I used it with my second pregnancy as well. This was my friend when I didn’t know what was going on in my pregnancy would definitely recommend to any new moms.
597,597,4,2021-03-11T09:01:41.000Z,Thenknees,simple but educational,"I am on my 9th month of pregnancy now, very anxious to finally meet my baby girl. The app helped me prepare myself for the day she finally arrives and on top of that, I also stumble upon articles that discusses simple things i didn't really care about before but are actually necessary: gift registry items, how to order feee pump though your insurance, etc."
598,598,5,2020-12-18T23:07:08.000Z,Erinelle15,Best pregnancy app,"This app is super helpful and informative! I enjoy the daily articles and appreciate all the tips it delivers. It was fun to keep up with my pregnancy, and see all the changes my body was going through. I also liked how you could track your symptoms and log your weight."
599,599,4,2019-12-09T20:39:59.000Z,newmama123,Daily prenatal question,"I like this app, but please please PLEASE stop asking me everyday if I took my prenatal. That notification/message being the first thing I see every time I open the app is driving me absolutely crazy! If I have to continue answering that question every day for the next 6 months I honestly might delete it and use other apps."
600,600,5,2019-04-01T01:21:33.000Z,C-rag3,Very informative!!!!,"I gave this app five stars. The reason why is because it’s incredible helpful and informative. I love the fact that it tells you what’s going on with baby and mommy. But that’s not the only thing, it gives you lists of safe foods/medicines that are safe to eat/take during pregnancy."
601,601,5,2019-06-01T10:20:05.000Z,Amanda00000005,First time mom must use,"I decided early on to stick to Ovia, and a book from Mayo Clinic for baby info. Staying off google has been instrumental in keeping me relaxed- there’s a lot of crazy bad information out there! Loved Ovias food safety lookup guide l, hand/foot size, and fruit of each week. Also loved following the weekly videos."
602,602,5,2021-01-22T20:23:00.000Z,debgwin,"Easy, detailed","I enjoy reading the updates every week as they’re more in depth than many other apps. I enjoy they give an option to read more on multiples as well, I’m carrying twins and not many apps offer this. And the size comparison of hands and feet is really cute too."
603,603,1,2021-05-04T13:02:31.000Z,inlovewithroses,Privacy Concern,"I loved the app for my first two pregnancies, but this morning I was woken up by my ex-husband congratulating me on my pregnancy. I feel slightly violated and wish there was something that prompted the user to ask if their information was still correct. Especially in situations like these where certain things may not be shared with others for an array of reasons. I am now extremely anxious and uncomfortable knowing an intimate event has now been shared with someone who I do not feel safe knowing that information."
604,604,5,2020-12-25T19:55:22.000Z,Em Rose Per,Login frustration,The app now tells me my device isn’t compatible with Ovia’s security standards and won’t let me log in. When I try to download and log into the app from my husband’s phone it keeps saying my session timed out and won’t allow me to log in. Very frustrating.
605,605,5,2019-12-12T16:44:29.000Z,Omgitzme87,Great app,"Love this app. I used Ovia for trying to conceive and it was awesome, and then after getting pregnant I switched to Ovia Pregnancy. I love everything except for the daily questions to ask if I took my prenatal vitamin which become annoying if you are a heavy user like me. There should be a way to shut those off."
606,606,3,2020-12-08T04:48:10.000Z,Losgsbjc,Not particularly helpful,"The app stops providing a lot of helpful information at a certain point in the third trimester. Just a lot of “baby is continuing to get bigger” (...obviously...). Also the size comparisons are bizarre. I’m 37 weeks and it says he’s the size of a tackle box or a honey dew melon, which don’t seem comparable. Finally, Gina’s weekly chats are like a cheese grater on my nerves, and they aren’t relevant during COVID. Oh, treat myself to a pedicure Gina? Thanks for the crap advice."
607,607,5,2019-08-11T14:37:27.000Z,PlayingTheSystem,"Best pregnancy app, hands down","I had a different pregnancy app until about 20 weeks, when my friend recommended this app. It has been SO much more informative, and has so many tools, tips, and checklists to help you along the way. I am super happy with this app, and recommended it to anyone who is pregnant!"
608,608,5,2019-08-09T23:14:39.000Z,Mrs bombshell,Best Pregnancy App,Very user friendly. Content isn’t overwhelming. I used every day for my first pregnancy and am using again for my second pregnancy.
609,609,3,2019-07-28T16:31:53.000Z,beckly_freckly,Not a 5 star app anymore,"I love Ovia. I’ve used it for every pregnancy & I use the Fertility app to track my period. However, since they add the “In the Womb” feature the app is slow, laggy, and rendered unusable if you attempt to view your week in the womb. I’ll give more stars I’ve the bugs are fixed and the app improves, but at this point I’m already looking for a different app to track the rest of my pregnancy."
610,610,4,2017-10-12T19:19:41.000Z,Umm1994,Love but wish it geared towards cloth more!,I’ve used Ovia with both pregnancies now. I love the app and all the information. As a Cloth diaper family the constant ads for disposable diapers are a little too much. Also the discounts and things are only helpful if using disposable diapers. We love the app and will continue to use just wish it was geared towards all kinds of parenting styles.
611,611,5,2017-11-11T15:34:36.000Z,TatumJohn,Great App For First Time Mommy’s !,"Used this during my first pregnancy, it’s a free App, has SO much information and follows along with your baby as it grows, giving you countdowns, week by week calendar, gives you and incredible amount of baby info and life tips to help your bank with your precious new one arrives !! Love love love this app !!!"
612,612,5,2018-01-05T15:43:15.000Z,Mgunter316,Best app ever,"After going through different apps, this is the one I find the most helpful. I enjoy getting up each day and reading my baby's daily development. The one thing I look forward to is the day my weeks change and learning how big the baby is then. Great app!"
613,613,5,2018-04-07T17:25:13.000Z,Crazypants333,Amazing,"Used the app to track at first and we were using this to get pregnant when it happened. It was a great means to stay on top of our good days and now I use this one to track all of symptoms and growth as we go. Absolutely love this app, been amazingly helpful through this whole journey."
614,614,5,2018-04-10T15:44:42.000Z,Drteach,Wish I got this sooner!,"I am loving this app!  The ability to put in my baby name and have items personalized was a great touch!  I also love the daily emails and the updated information each day.  I ended up choosing other apps initially, but wish I would have chosen this... it’s been great!"
615,615,5,2018-10-25T11:08:58.000Z,ceht317,Keep coming back,"I used this app for my first pregnancy and wanted to mix things up and try a different one this time around. I couldn’t find one that had all the features I liked so came back to Ovia. It is user friendly, positive (not full of scary articles etc), helpful, and fun."
616,616,5,2019-03-20T10:55:38.000Z,LuckyinLov,Great app...recommended!,"Has all the important aspects like med. look up and food safety look up. Look forward every week to reading or watching our baby’s development and symptoms I’m experiencing. Also so fun to see the size comparison picture, 4 options. I recommend this app to all expectant mothers!"
617,617,5,2021-07-06T10:25:00.000Z,redrose#22,Very helpful👍👍,"I think this app is a must have☺️REALLY!!! This app has helped me through out my pregnancy🥰 I have a week left and I wanted to tell moms to be how helpful this app is!!!! Sooooooooooo Moms to be congratulations and I hope this app help you as much as it did for me🥰if you haven’t got your flowers, this is just for you🤗🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸"
618,618,3,2021-08-11T09:27:32.000Z,baby_tracker1,It’s good,"I used the ovia period tracker which made me want to use the pregnancy tracker. I like how detailed the tracking is! It’s a great app except in the baby development section, about 2/3 of the time they use the pronouns she/her and the other 1/3 they use he/him. It’s just very inconsistent and I feel like they could use gender neutral pronouns until a gender is plugged into the app. This is definitely an area that needs improvement."
619,619,5,2021-03-30T22:34:37.000Z,cc2saucy,Pregnancy tracker,"Although I haven’t gotten pregnant this app has helped track everything I need to know when to try and conceive. It asks all the right questions, let you track everything you need and gives constant tips/ reviews from other viewers."
620,620,5,2018-11-24T14:08:51.000Z,LaraGeorge,Supportive App,"I have been using the app since I found out I was pregnant and I enter information daily, I would like to see more articles about transitioning from 1st to 2nd trimester and also details about Down syndrome tests and finding out the gender. Overall I am still happy with the app!"
621,621,5,2021-03-28T19:14:33.000Z,Jane_garrison,Convenient and detailed,"This app has been super helpful to track my periods, fertility and health that goes along with it! My husband and I conceived our first baby with the help of the fertility info on this app. I used their pregnancy app for my entire pregnancy. It’s simple yet the information you document is detailed."
622,622,5,2021-03-17T23:49:37.000Z,Buffingtontaylor,Exciting & Informative,Ovia pregnancy was such a fun weekly update on my tiny human. Love all of the details and articles they provide through out the process relevant to where you are at. After baby is born It continues providing lots of information and resources for where your baby is at based on birth date! LOVE It
623,623,5,2020-12-31T05:26:17.000Z,khalil anbd,Great,Wonderful app definitely helped me with trackingOh my pregnancy also I was doing was letting me know what was going on in each trimester. It is a big help to know to look forward to good and bad. And also help me understand my body better as my baby grill definitely a wonderful app for first time mothers.
624,624,5,2020-12-27T15:22:06.000Z,ANLower1107,Fun and Simple,"This app makes this whole process so much less overwhelming! The articles and videos, offers, and daily and weekly updates are so helpful! I look forward to learning something new everyday and sharing the info with my husband :)"
625,625,5,2020-12-03T22:37:54.000Z,AuthenticDeva,Very Helpful,This app was very helpful during my pregnancy. The daily information about each stage of my pregnancy and being able to track how I was feeling helped to make this pregnancy less stressful especially with the state that our world is in at the present time.
626,626,5,2020-04-25T00:35:33.000Z,Tsampson09,By far the best,"Awesome! I love being able to customize the app. It has an awesome user friendly community. I like that it has many features such as tracking weight, food, etc. everything about this app was great. I also had the what to expect app and it is no match to Ovia!"
627,627,4,2020-10-31T14:59:27.000Z,Rika10003,"Pop ups are annoying but past that, great app!","Second-time using it, and I love it. I hate how riddled with ads it is, especially when I’m just trying to read weekly development milestones, and the pop-ups always show up randomly and take you out of the app. But the app itself is good aside from those minor annoyances"
628,628,4,2020-06-18T14:59:58.000Z,Nmarustad,Small changes could make it perfect.,I gave this app four stars because I cannot fill out My Healthcare Info because it only accepts hospitals. What about birth centers or home birth? I would appreciate if it was a bit more all inclusive. But besides that it is super simple to use and I love that it has more options for babies approximate size than just fruit.
629,629,3,2019-11-07T23:21:24.000Z,_*omnomnom*_,Love it but...,"I love this app and have been using it since day 1 of my pregnancy, however recently it hasn’t been working right, loading slowly and since last week isn’t loading at all. I like using this app for the updates and to track certain things so it’s very unfortunate that I can’t even use the app anymore. I would appreciate this being fixed so much."
630,630,5,2018-02-14T16:09:20.000Z,Fhibdbu,Love,Loved this app during pregnancy. It was so was easy to look up foods I could or couldn’t eat. I learnt a lot about my pregnancy symptoms and when something changed in my body I used the app to see if it was a coming pregnancy symptom. My mom had the app too and she loved keeping track of her grandsons development.
631,631,3,2018-12-09T23:24:24.000Z,CommonSenseNancy,Good Enough,I wish there was a way to flag inappropriate or rude comments on the posts. You’ve got name calling and some of these women are just so rude and quick to judge. You’d think that as a community full of pregnant women they would be more considerate of their verbiage knowing the women they are communicating with are going through hormonal changes and may not take it so lightly. Like they say every pregnancy is different- so don’t be a rude B word.
632,632,2,2019-04-09T22:27:12.000Z,Weight frustrated,No longer see weight values in graphs,Loved the app for tracking my weight until the latest update took away the weight values in the graph format. I have the dots still but no weight value shows up when I click the dot. I also don’t like how changing the goal weight doesn’t accurately change the trend view for weights. I primarily use the app to track weight and blood pressure so it’s a bit of a bummer the last update made it glitch for me.
633,633,5,2021-03-17T21:42:22.000Z,Saludez,Twice perfection,"I’ve used this app twice now and I’ve loved it each time! With the daily updates and the medication and food look up, I use this app everyday!! I tell all my friends to use this app because it’s so simple and has everything you need!"
634,634,5,2021-01-15T14:34:05.000Z,Sun46544,Preggeriffic,"I used their fertility app initially. I knew based off that, I would want to use this one. I like the discussion boards. You can find others in the same situation as you and get guidance and reassurance. The app is cute and gives you a good description of what baby is doing week by week."
635,635,5,2020-12-22T17:04:36.000Z,L1zzyy,This app is fantastic,I used this app with my first pregnancy and it helped me understand things about my child growing and how to properly prepare myself when she came. The photos and explanations were cute and easy to understand. I would definitely use this again!
636,636,5,2020-12-18T20:06:20.000Z,daisy676,Loved this!,This app is so amazing I used it with my pregnancy! I would always go on the app every day to update my status and also read how my baby was growing. This app helped me so much it cares about your mental health with postpartum. It has blogs you can read about and also videos!! Great app to have.
637,637,5,2020-12-13T21:48:12.000Z,angelicaviana,Love this app!,I’ve been using this app since I’ve downloaded it back in August! I’m able to track so much on this app that this is the main app I use! Definitely recommend for anyone trying to keep track of everything in one location!
638,638,5,2020-07-21T04:24:33.000Z,Lovely lashae,Love love love it.,This is my second pregnancy but my first time using this app. I love it. I use this app and three others and this is the only one that has a free kick counter and contraction timer. I also love the hand and feet size comparison. I love all the free tools within this app and I would highly recommend it.
639,639,3,2019-11-01T21:29:26.000Z,mnm7171,"Love, but I wish the in the womb pictures would load","I love this app from the tracking it offers and fun tidbits about how the baby is developing, but i am extremely disappointed that the “in the womb” feature never loads. That is one of my favorite parts to see, but it will never load for me to be able to look at it. I really wish this bug would be fixed!"
640,640,5,2017-09-08T18:00:04.000Z,ovoabbs,Love love love!,"Absolutely love this app! There are so many different fun and exciting ways to learn about your baby and his/her's growth. All the different extras it had are a bonus! Such as reminds to set up for a birthing class, or how you can interact with other moms! Love this app and will recommend to all my future mommies, 5 stars!"
641,641,5,2017-09-12T07:33:37.000Z,Mpmt22,Love it,"I normally love this app, but lately it won't even open for me. It just shows the opening screen and then shuts down."
642,642,5,2017-10-09T03:02:14.000Z,43KayEm,Keeps me on track,"I used the Ovia to track my cycle since it had been 4years since my last one. It helped keep me on track with logging symptoms, medications, periods, etc. Now I’ve started the Ovia pregnancy app and the information transferred over for me! It’s very handy and I’d recommend it to everyone."
643,643,5,2018-01-18T04:09:40.000Z,chrdearie,App puts a first time mom at ease,I love this app because of the community chat! Being a first time mom can be scary and you can ask any strange questions you might have to the community chat. Getting feedback from experienced and other first time moms has really help to put my mind at ease!
644,644,5,2018-04-24T17:57:17.000Z,mamataytayy,Love Ovia!!,I’m using Ovia for the SECOND time as I am currently pregnant with baby #2! I love Ovia! It had SOOO much informational content. I love that it updates daily and walks you through every single detail of pregnancy and what you and your baby are going through. I would choose this app over and over again for pregnancy!!
645,645,5,2018-07-24T14:03:36.000Z,its amazing 😍,i love ovia pregnancy app !,"since I’ve got pregnant OVIA PREGNANCY had been my best friend , It’s an amazing app which gave me all what I need to know about my baby development and my body’s too since the first day of pregnancy, Also the food and medicine safety lookup was fascinating  I truly recommend it for every pregnant woman as a reference for her in her pregnancy trip!!"
646,646,4,2018-10-29T11:24:27.000Z,megalcamo,What’s with daily questions?!?,There needs to be a setting for the daily questions that recently started showing up! They are beyond annoying and it’s the only reason I won’t give 5 stars. I don’t need to answer a question on prenatal vitamins etc. once this gets fixed and taken away I will change to 5!
647,647,5,2021-01-27T15:34:57.000Z,hay_111,So much fun,"This app was amazing to have throughout my last pregnancy and now I’m using it again!! It is so much fun learning about your baby each week and reassuring to read that what your body is going through is normal, as well! My favorite part is the hand and feet sizes! So much fun and so cute!!"
648,648,5,2021-01-23T13:27:29.000Z,cdauwel,Great app,"Love this app!! Has so much information and love how you can track your mood, what you eat and drink, and can upload bump pictures at any time. Only app I’ve found that shows how big baby is and you get to pick the theme again to show their hands and feet."
649,649,5,2021-01-19T23:02:21.000Z,natalienbaby,Love this app,"This is the best app I’ve found while pregnant. It keeps me updated with new stuff going on with baby, I also get to share the same info with my baby’s father (he looks at it more then me) it also lets me keep track with any appointments I have . I swear it’s a 10/10 for me"
650,650,5,2018-01-14T02:20:49.000Z,Patrick John McIntyre,Was lost. Keyword “was lost”,"I was lost at first, but this app is helping me in huge ways.  Thanks to this app, I have been able to take steps to ensure my girlfriend, her pregnancy goes as planned. I love her very much and want our baby to be as healthy as possible.  Great app for new parents who don’t really know what to expect."
651,651,5,2018-03-01T16:53:10.000Z,TXMoxy,Momma at 42,The Ovia app has been spot on with symptoms. As a first time Mom it is good to have Ovia at my fingertips to read when I wake in the morning. My husband asks every morning “What’s baby doing today?” And just having small updates can keep you positive when you might be feeling very good.
652,652,3,2018-07-13T04:30:00.000Z,eejjvcc,Assuming mom's are all SAHMs is so 1950,"The latest article about involving the partner starts out great. Encouraging them to attend appointments and birthing classes is perfect. But then discussing how even if your partner has a full time job remind them that the baby is as much their responsibility as yours? That smacks of the birth parent (i.e. Mom) staying at home while the other brings home the paycheck. Some choose that life, others don't. It's 2018 time for a rewrite."
653,653,4,2018-07-24T12:23:35.000Z,Sweetazahoney,Great App,I learned of this app from my cousin who has 2 children. This is my first and the app has been spot on every week. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because THE BUMP has this 3D imaging where you can SEE the baby’s progression and I’m a very visual person. So not every app has everything you want but its still a great tool to use.
654,654,3,2018-09-19T17:18:47.000Z,Kad11111,Best app but overly inquisitive,"This is the best pregnancy app I’ve seen (way better than The Bump), however, I am not a fan of the overly personal medical questions that intrusively pop up each time I open the app. I don’t need to share any medical information with a pregnancy app, thanks. That’s why I have doctors. There are already plenty of ads littering the home screen (understandably), but these questions are too much."
655,655,5,2018-12-01T23:37:10.000Z,Mandy and baby,Wonderful App,This app was spot on with everything from the things that were developing in my baby to how it was affecting my body! It answers 100s of questions from food safety to how to handle my immune system and exercise throughout the pregnancy! I couldn’t have found a better app!
656,656,5,2019-01-20T17:01:19.000Z,C.a aaa,Great app,"I love this application , 4 years later after having my first son I’m pregnant again , I feel new to everything , this application has a lot of great information and keeps track of a lot I highly recommend it . Try it you’ll see for yourself !"
657,657,2,2019-04-06T16:06:28.000Z,TwoIn2019,Nothing for Twins,"I used Ovia until I found out we were having twins. Ovia offers an option to select “twins” in the settings, yet proceeds to refer to your “baby” as a singleton and does not acknowledge both babies. It also provides zero new information on twin pregnancy and does not discuss multiples in any way after selecting twins.. disappointing. Maybe they need to update? Maybe they need a different app for twins? Unfortunately, it seems like Ovia is not concerned about multiples."
658,658,5,2021-01-18T05:07:27.000Z,Kait32B,Great App,I have used this app for all three of my pregnancies now and I love it! It’s very informational and also very enjoyable! I love how you can customize the app almost entirely from colors/theme to having your partner involved through the app as well! It’s an overall great app and I recommend it 10/10!
659,659,5,2020-03-14T14:58:01.000Z,Puffin!,Helpful and entertaining!,"I love this app, so helpful all the way through pregnancy, and through delivery. It has all the information and resources you could want in one place while also providing an entertainment factor each week. I really enjoyed using this app!"
660,660,5,2017-09-25T13:37:42.000Z,zobaby97,I really love this app!,I'm a first time mom and this app helps me better communicate with hubby what's going on with the growth of our baby. It's exiting to also be able to communicate with other moms who are in different stages of pregnancy. Definitely download with no hesitation. Thanks for creating this comprehensive guide to pregnancy!! 😊
661,661,5,2017-10-18T10:50:12.000Z,Jfigueroa56,Love it!,"I love this App and it’s been super resourceful thus far. I’m pregnant with my first so I’ve enjoyed all the information this app has offered, especially the eating recommendations. I mostly enjoy the community where moms from all over can anonymously converse and ask questions to other moms on the app!"
662,662,5,2021-08-17T01:40:52.000Z,astrirahardja,Best pregnancy app,This is the best pregnancy app that I used. I am pregnant for the first time and tried out different apps in the beginning to track my pregnancy. Ovia is the only app that I used by the time I reached the end or my first trimester onwards because the informations are clear and love the user interface of it all.
663,663,5,2021-03-10T06:24:52.000Z,Maliakal1996,Best app ever,Used for every single pregnancy. Even started had friends start using this app. This is my favorite app. I check it daily for the daily update and the constant knowledge. I love how there’s so much to learn and so many things you can do with this app to track your pregnancy
664,664,4,2021-03-15T13:37:05.000Z,Syd Shreffler,Great Tracker!,"I love this app—I’ve been using Ovia in one of its versions since I got pregnant and now with a toddler as we’re trying to manage the growth and development of our family, it’s invaluable! The pregnancy was simple to use and didn’t have a lot of unnecessary frills, just what I needed in a busy pregnancy! I look forward to using it next time!"
665,665,5,2021-01-28T18:52:52.000Z,Pativortiz,Great app!,I’ve been using Ovia for the past few years and it’s always helped me so much with letting me know when I’m supposed to get my period or when I’m ovulating and this last time it helped me get pregnant the first month I was trying. I recommend this app to everyone ☺️
666,666,5,2021-01-12T04:43:31.000Z,kaitlyn s 15,Great App!,"I love this app. I used their fertility tracking app and now this one! Very user friendly, simple to use. I LOVE how they give the hand and foot comparison, I think that is the cutest thing. There is also a chat page as well that I have used quite a bit. Highly recommend!"
667,667,5,2020-12-18T22:00:44.000Z,njunjoi,Pregnancy x2,Used this for both of my pregnancies with my girls! Loved the weekly updates. I had some issues in the beginning of my 2nd one and the message boards were so helpful to hear from others experiencing the same issues. Keeps you totally annomonus!
668,668,5,2020-12-18T20:11:51.000Z,Yeah000000,Wonderful App,"Easy to use, has everything in one place & gives great tips throughout the pregnancy! I’ve used all 3 apps & they’re all what I look for! Nothing too complicated, and gives great knowledgeable information! Would recommend to everyone!"
669,669,5,2020-12-15T00:13:27.000Z,Hazelj13,Literally the BEST APP,I love the app! It makes me feel like I am closer and closer to my baby every day. It goes into detail about the growth of the baby and your own body daily. Even has example pictures of the baby in the womb and the size of the baby compared to actual objects..definitely a MUST HAVE APP.
670,670,5,2018-01-19T17:42:22.000Z,Jeskissd,Excellent,The best baby/ pregnancy app out of them all that’s FREE! I’ve downloaded about 4 different ones and this one is the best. I love how it gives you little tips and info a few times a day regarding where your at in your pregnancy. Would definitely recommend this app to all preggy mamas!!
671,671,5,2018-11-13T12:45:32.000Z,DiorsDoll,Best pregnancy app out there,"When I found out I was pregnant, I only knew the conception date.  This is the only app that allowed several choices like, conception date, due date, date of last period to get on the app. All features and reminders r great and easy to use."
672,672,5,2018-12-17T10:55:35.000Z,iiittsalissa,Love!,"This app is very user friendly, educational, and provides a great sense of excitement for moms to be. Tracking progress is easy, and I love being able to track milestones and dr appts on the calendar. I also used Ovia Fertility before I was pregnant and I loved that just as much. Will definitely be trying Ovia Parenting come August."
673,673,4,2019-01-07T12:47:03.000Z,nightsngel0311,Best of the apps,The layout is great.  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is because I put in my information and I still don’t have access to all areas and it doesn’t tell me how.  I put in my information.  I’m a high risk pregnancy so having  access to some of my concerned areas would have been graciously appreciated.
674,674,3,2020-08-29T01:12:34.000Z,Kweather9812,"Always loved, but ads are an issue now",I am toward the end of my pregnancy and have used this app since I was only 4 weeks along. I also used this with my first pregnancy.
675,675,4,2020-04-10T02:47:02.000Z,29PMagMoose,Good for the most part,"Overall it’s a simple app and mirrors the Ovia app with the health tracking. The only minor glitch/issue I have is that the Ovia Pregnancy app doesn’t retain all data when inputted at different times throughout the day, for example I recorded different symptoms at 0800 then another set of symptoms at 1000 but can’t see the data from 0800."
676,676,1,2020-01-19T19:59:33.000Z,x0xperlax0x,Can't Even Sign Up + They Sell Your Info,"Same problem as other users. Never gets pass the sign up page. I tried making different accounts snd linking facebook anc nothing works. Oh well, guess I'll use a less buggy app instead."
677,677,5,2021-03-11T22:04:47.000Z,krispykrispers,Easy to use and very helpful,I use all 3 Ovia apps.  They not only work smoothly but are super helpful.  I used this to track my pregnancy.  Tracked daily and it was very easy to use.  Once I had the baby I transitioned back to the Ovia fertility tracking app to track my cycle as well as the parenting app.
678,678,3,2021-04-13T19:31:51.000Z,ShelliKing,Better than Other Apps,"I tested many of pregnancy apps and like this one the most for all the features offer. However, I wished there was app that had a pregnancy week by week or trimester by trimester to-do list that is customizable. As I read from my pregnancy books, I have to make a mental note to follow up on certain suggestions at a later point in my pregnancy."
679,679,5,2021-03-11T19:07:31.000Z,hulagirl_t,Love this app!,"When I was pregnant, I downloaded every app I could find. This was the only one that not only stuck around the entire pregnancy, but I downloaded the parenting app post baby because the info was so spot on!"
680,680,4,2018-05-16T13:50:07.000Z,katcarrol,Great app,The only things I would change: please add caffeine to the food tracker so that I can keep up with my intake & make sure it’s limited.
681,681,3,2018-09-19T18:58:12.000Z,cate0721,"Functional, not the best.","This app is functional, but I like others better that have more realistic videos of what the baby looks like in the womb, instead of just a yellow cartoon baby like Ovia has. This app also has absolutely no support for home birth, if it’s mentioned, it’s basically an after thought like “oh, some people do this.” All in all, it’s okay. Gives you information."
682,682,2,2018-11-07T14:26:28.000Z,ALKM1122,Inappropriate use of Gender Pronouns,"I just found out that I am pregnant and was excited to start using this app. Unfortunately, the app automatically refers to my baby as HE and HIM. Considering what is going on in the world and that pregnancy should be female centered, this was quite disappointing. I hope they change pronouns to THEY and THEM until I have the information to select a gender for my baby. Until that change is made, I won’t be using this app."
683,683,3,2018-11-15T09:12:10.000Z,789BR,It's an okay App,"Some nice info but when you fill out questionnaires to test your knowledge, you get no results and don't know if what you know is right or not.  So skip those, they are a waste of time and won't help you."
684,684,2,2019-04-12T13:26:19.000Z,Dinojka,Unreliable Community / No Export,"The health tracking on the app is great, but the Community section is NOT for first time Moms. You have to answer the question in order to see what others said so if you don’t know, you just have to guess (creating unreliable info) or never see what experienced moms said."
685,685,4,2019-06-02T12:14:30.000Z,Meckaleckahimeckahinyho,Loved this app in my 1st & 2nd Trimester,"But now that I’m in my 3rd the updates are kind of the same everyday. It would be awesome to see like a daily update with evidence based facts about stuff we’ll need to know during birth (I.e. epidurals, dilation, early labor) or tips on how to cope with labor pains. Love this app though, it’s been so useful and my favorite one to use throughout my pregnancy!"
686,686,5,2021-01-23T17:28:55.000Z,chantal slo,Just what we needed,"I’ve used all three apps from fertility tracking, to the pregnancy app and now the parent app. They’ve been so great and actually useful! Currently, I use the feeding timer and tracker everyday which is helpful in us understanding and creating a better schedule."
687,687,5,2020-12-18T19:52:12.000Z,Teddy Momma,The best out there!!!,All I can say is I’m excited to be using this app. With my daughter I had another one but it wasn’t the best of the best. With this one I can know how big my baby is and get so much information I didn’t have with my daughter at the time. So excited already!
688,688,5,2020-01-22T05:23:17.000Z,YAYAMY,The Best Pregnancy app out there!!,This is really the best pregnancy app out there. I tried a lot before I came across this one. The big reasons why I like it so much are because it tracks moods and the articles are really informative and scientific sourced. I wish you could favorite the articles
689,689,5,2019-12-18T21:17:46.000Z,Mezerimay,Still as good as 5 years ago!,"Updated review: I reviewed this app five years ago when I had my first baby.  This is my second pregnancy and I’m still getting a lot out of this app.  It has not declined in quality or ease of use, even the marketing is very unintrusive! Highly recommend as a great resource for new and any moms!"
690,690,3,2017-11-03T07:12:25.000Z,SayrePA,Not sure about this one...,"I like this app but every time there is an iOS update, the app doesn’t work properly. It will be okay one minute and then the next it will refuse to load something. I have to shut it down completely and reload it to get it to work. Also, a lot of common OTC meds here in America seems to not be on their medication safety lookup. They really need to add more."
691,691,5,2018-02-04T17:25:34.000Z,kness baby,Super fun for the whole family,I did this app cause this is my 3rd pregnancy An will be 10 years apart. So having my kids get very excited about their brother was important to me. They absolutely love seeing what coming up next week An love the actual sizes it gives us.
692,692,3,2019-06-08T11:05:56.000Z,Kkaczz,Pretty cool but wish it could be more personalized,I like the app compared to others that I used during my first pregnancy but I wish there was a way to either set some kind nutrition preferences or to hide content that has no value to the user. It’s gets annoying to have recipe after recipe pop up daily that I cannot eat whatsoever and no way to hide them! Feed overload.
693,693,5,2021-03-31T16:18:17.000Z,jrdynbyrd,I love this app!!,"This being my first pregnancy, the Ovia pregnancy tracker app has been life changing! It is so helpful in letting me know what’s coming and what’s changing in my body as well as my baby’s! What a wonderfully configured app! The details it provides are spot on and it tracked my due date perfectly!"
694,694,5,2020-12-16T14:15:04.000Z,ptco1,App is really helpful!,"I love that you customize the baby size tracker, and there’s lots of great information as you move through each week. Plus the doc appt tracker and question log is super useful when you visit your physician! Would recommend."
695,695,4,2020-12-18T19:07:48.000Z,Trish EC,Pregnancy Buddy,"This is our first baby and I wanted an app that was more than just the basic info. I love the extra information it provides me. Not only does it give you week by week, but it give you other helpful information and allows you to track important medical information."
696,696,5,2020-05-14T03:06:09.000Z,Roosiepoosie9999,I tried them all. This is easily my fav!,"Tried TheBump, WhattoExpect, etc! None of them are as clear about exactly how many weeks and days you are in and exactly how far you have to go. I love the different size comparisons. The hand and feet comparison is genius and such a precious visual."
697,697,5,2020-02-20T19:28:22.000Z,Sara_AckermanSNK,Wonderful,"I am currently 6 months pregnant and I love this app. I love being able to know how big my baby is and what they are starting to look like. This is my first baby so I’ve been wanting to be as interactive as I can. I love that I can log my appointments, milestones, health and medications. This app is great!"
698,698,4,2019-11-08T17:01:28.000Z,AlrexH,Love it but takes forever to load!,"I LOVE this app! I downloaded 4 to see which I like best and I kept only this one. However, it seems like the longer I use it and the more data I enter, it takes forever to load and crashes all the time."
699,699,1,2020-01-17T02:58:21.000Z,AK lindsay,Couldn’t create an account,"Downloaded this app with high hopes, unfortunately it would not let me create an account via email or Facebook- an error message popped up with “bad request” then would continue to pop up until the app crashed. Eventually it said “too many requests, try again later”. Honestly, probably will not try again; in today’s society if your app doesn’t work brilliantly from the first access, most wont wait around for it to work."
700,700,3,2017-09-25T11:53:04.000Z,Dance Biscuit,Data Queen!!,"UPDATE FROM 5 TO 3 STARS: I still love the app, but it keeps crashing. It's fully updated, but every time I try opening it, it crashes. Please fix this issue"
701,701,4,2017-10-20T10:00:57.000Z,hisgirl0904,Great app but could add...,This is a great app and I love how personalized it is but I need 3 different baby apps because one app has my bumpies (pregnancy selfies with the baby bump to see growth) and another app has a 3D image that I can see how my baby looks in the womb. These features are both on other apps and if they could be added I could have just one app.
702,702,5,2017-12-10T14:25:32.000Z,MommaLette4,Love it,"I love this app, my doctor suggested it and it's been super helpful. I really like the messaging part of it and be able to get answers or suggestions from others. I'm having twins and there are multiple people on here that are having twins as well. Which is super helpful!!"
703,703,1,2018-02-11T04:23:06.000Z,boosmama81118,Rude Moms,I actually like this app a lot more than 5 stars but I find myself not being able to use the community. So many rude moms on there and I can never find the love and support from some of the other moms that I expected. From now on I will use the app just to check on my baby’s development and to read the articles. Any questions I have I will ask my doctor or someone I know who has kids because the moms I see on that app are rude and don’t deserve kids. Just being honest.
704,704,5,2018-04-14T13:30:51.000Z,Scottie2222,Great pregnancy app,"This is a wonderful pregnancy tracking app. It’s customizable, can log health outcomes and milestones, and has a great support system within the app where people can ask questions. As a first time mom, this is useful and makes me feel more prepared for our little one."
705,705,5,2018-12-28T14:30:02.000Z,*stellar*,Enjoyable,"This is a great app for information, keeping track and seeing the progress during your pregnancy. I have found it very helpful and special for seeing what is going on in there since you can’t watch. I recommend this app!"
706,706,5,2019-02-08T13:42:00.000Z,HK0605,"Useful, fun, great layout","It’s informative, easy and fun to use, and the spoke person is actually relatable, which I did not find with the “what to expect” app. Also more modern when it comes to promoting maternal health habits and exercise. Really enjoying and using this app daily during pregnancy. Thanks!"
707,707,4,2019-05-01T08:57:25.000Z,DimplesHeaven101,Ovia,"i really love this app, the only thing that i’m not a fan of is how theres a limit of 300 for character count, it would really help and improve the app if you raised it to 500. it’d help us pregnant women come together a bit more about things if we had more space to type since we’re all anonymous on the polls we post"
708,708,4,2021-08-06T17:04:57.000Z,HaleyO93,Great app but could use some changes,I like the app so far but just a suggestion for the community feature; it would be great to allow open ended answers since not all questions moms and moms to be have are yes or no answers. I haven’t seen anywhere to voice my suggestion so putting it here.
709,709,1,2021-07-26T18:46:28.000Z,oxolove,The Q&A seriously needs to be revamped,"The Q&A section on here is the main constructive criticism for developers. The same questions are asked daily, multiple times. This leaves it difficult to sift through valuable questions and have your own questions answered. There are also answers on here that people take as fact, rather than calling their own doctors, especially when it comes to Covid and self harm. People have arguments on here that aren’t necessary and it’s overall a toxic place."
710,710,5,2018-07-20T04:40:17.000Z,Elephant Girl ❤️,Ovia,"I love it ❤️ it's helps me know everything that's going on and how he is growing, what's happening to him, and how it affects me. I love how there is a safety food and medicine look up so I don't have to call anyone to make sure I can have or take whatever it is I'm worried about plus it gives nice recipes ❤️❤️"
711,711,5,2021-03-11T01:23:17.000Z,Ryan&Julie,BEST APP,I was using other apps to track my ovulation but was unsuccessful for months at getting pregnant until i was referred to Ovia Fertility & I literally got pregnant that month!!! it’s amazing!! I’m due with my baby boy in May! Now i use their pregnancy app & it’s the best!! it’s so informative & I LOVE the fruit & veggie baby size references they’re so cute!
712,712,5,2021-03-10T03:32:54.000Z,Rela342,Great intuitive app,"As an ObGyn and expecting mother, I truly enjoy this app and have recommended it to many friends and parents. There are some industry-driven advertisements which I ignore, but the overall info is accurate and the baby size tracker is the most adorable I’ve seen."
713,713,5,2020-12-19T12:46:36.000Z,dove /candy,Great App,"Very useful app in tracking fertility and pregnancy. Accurate and true proven with results. I love the ability to communicate with other expecting parents across the world. Once you’re expecting the app gives you detailed descriptions of each pregnancy week , stage and trimester."
714,714,2,2021-02-03T17:59:00.000Z,zasha786,Way too much advertising,"I wanted helpful information but it’s so hard to read through as evey third post is an advertisement for cord blood banking, universal registry or early gender tests... it’s hard to sometimes go through and feels like they are always trying to sell something. I feel like o have t read stuff with skepticism because it may start out as a helpful post and at the there is a bunch of product placement."
715,715,5,2020-12-18T04:25:39.000Z,alliecarty,Love it,This app was easy to use and had great info about what was going on at each week. I loved reading the articles about different topics and enjoyed seeing my little guy as he progressed through each stage of development. Highly recommend!!
716,716,5,2020-04-14T01:40:45.000Z,allnicknamesivetriedaretaken,Love this app!,"I’m due in just four days and I’ve been using this app for months now. I love how easy it is to learn and all of the features. My favorites are the symptom and mood trackers, kick counter, contraction timer, and baby name finder. I also love how I can compare the baby’s size to cute animals."
717,717,3,2020-08-31T11:04:17.000Z,Dani2290,Great app but the ads are horrible,This app is by far my favorite because it allows you to enter in data and track everything. HOWEVER the amount of unnecessary ads that pop up on your main page are what frustrate me. When I want to scroll through everyday to see updates on the baby I have to pick through the ads.
718,718,3,2020-07-06T18:12:11.000Z,aidens mum,"Great, but with Ads","One of the best pregnancy apps out there. I love the color and design. The ease of use is great. BUT all the ads are for formula. Not the best option, a good one if you need to, but not the healthiest option. I’m insulted that any app would promote formula by letting so many sponsored ads for formula be all over. Healthy, informed decisions are important during pregnancy. An app shouldn’t dictate or influence away from breastfeeding..."
719,719,3,2019-11-11T17:36:29.000Z,TamsieEva,"Used daily, but freezes often","I love how easy this app is to use and having an anonymous community to ask important questions is amazing. The biggest flaw that I’ve came across is how much it freezes. The app never crashes, it just become unusable sometimes. Very annoying and I’ve came close to deleting it multiple times."
720,720,3,2017-11-06T20:11:31.000Z,unicornZoe,"Like the content, which it was customizable",I generally like the content generated by Ovuline.  But some of my favorite features are buried in it and I wish I could reach them from the home screen. Also - the community section is a waste of time at best and a deep dive into the idiocy of humanity at worst. I wish I could turn it off. It really makes me worry about the people reproducing these days.
721,721,5,2018-01-03T17:54:06.000Z,Casey Duke,My fave pregnancy app!,"I’m 29 weeks pregnant with my first, so of course I downloaded every free pregnancy app I could find 😂😂 Ovia is by far my favorite. I love the daily tidbit about my baby plus the articles. I LOVE the weekly videos. I think the app has so much more to offer than the other pregnancy apps."
722,722,5,2018-02-05T21:49:30.000Z,K.farley,Wonderful!,"Ovia is by far the best app I’ve found for updates on my pregnancy! I also love the advice you can read and healthy recipes to try! It’s very informational. This app is great for first time moms. This is my second baby, but it answers lots of questions that first time mothers might have!"
723,723,3,2018-03-03T02:30:58.000Z,BabygirlRkr,Love it but,I wish the drawing of the baby was more realistic or even 3D. Also if I hide an article I don’t want to read I shouldn’t have to continue hiding that article or others like it. I should have the option if I want to read articles like a checklist of article topics I would like to see.
724,724,4,2018-04-22T14:26:36.000Z,CharliStar,Great app,I love the app I just hate that the daily update constantly refers to my baby as female even after I updated the app with my child’s gender being male. Before I found out the gender it didn’t bother me and I took it as a “sign” that maybe I was having a girl but after I told the app I was having a male it still refers to my baby as she/her. 🙄
725,725,5,2018-07-14T16:22:44.000Z,zeda234,Very good,I do really like this app. So far i am 8 weeks pregnant and i love seeing the size of my babys tiny hand and foot. I also love how ill get random messages on my phone that simply say “You’re beautiful” i know its just an app and it cant possibly know what i look like but its still pretty sweet.
726,726,5,2021-03-30T18:34:17.000Z,Rmg72288,Amazing app,"Great app with TONS of information that is always readily available. Love that you can change your “what is your baby this week” keeps it fun and exciting when at times, time seems to drag. Could not recommend more."
727,727,5,2021-03-12T18:36:23.000Z,Spider Monkey 2,AMAZING,I am on my 5 pregnancy and am beyond impressed with this app! So much better than the What to Expect app! They give you everything you need to know and the ability to look up symptoms and medications. I’ve used this app every time and will continue to do so.
728,728,5,2021-03-10T16:35:18.000Z,chtfh,Love,"Love this app for tracking pregnancy, easy to use, cute and have very nice features. i really like the food safety and medication safety feature. i already had a name picked out so i didn’t benefit from it much but i liked the target name thing too i thought that was a nice touch."
729,729,2,2021-01-06T00:57:43.000Z,alyg1101,Started off nice but then went crappy,"It was nice for a little while. I tracked all my things in it including emotions, how I was feeling physically and doctors appointment. Then it started randomly logging me out and won’t let me log back in so I keep having to make new profiles. Just did again today and not I’m just over it and downloading a different app that I can rely on without losing all my information all the time."
730,730,2,2017-09-27T00:26:19.000Z,firsttimebabymama,Great for first time pregnancy 🤰🏼,I had to come back and adjust my rating. Ever since the update they did it force quits all the time and it is much harder to track your medications. The app runs super slow now I'm rarely using it because it becomes just frustrating.
731,731,5,2017-10-03T23:19:02.000Z,A gorgeous monster princess,Love the updates,"This App has helped me answer questions, be excited and remember how far along I am! I love all the articles and updates about baby growth. Recommend it highly, as it has been something that has increased my excitement about baby."
732,732,5,2018-01-02T00:39:35.000Z,CoyWan,Great App!,"I love Ovia. I have downloaded at least 6 apps and Ovia is one of my top primary go to apps. Combined with books, my other app, expert advise, and trusted friends and family advise... Ovia is so consistent."
733,733,3,2018-01-23T05:11:51.000Z,brookelyn0828,Not working anymore,"I love this app and used it throughout my first pregnancy. With this pregnancy I downloaded the app again. Everything was great for about a week. Now the app won’t open. It freezes on the log in page or closes within a few seconds. I’ve tried deleting and downloading the app again, but that didn’t work. Please fix it!!!"
734,734,5,2018-05-06T13:15:04.000Z,tebnm,Love it,I love this app this is my first pregnancy and it is so helpful to be able to chat with other moms that has already been through what I’m going through and not have to call a dr over simple non emergency questions and issues I’ve had
735,735,4,2018-08-18T20:32:36.000Z,MilaV22,Better than the rest?,I love this app more than any of my other pregnancy apps the only this i wish was better is the update pictures of what the baby looks like every week I wish they were more realistic like pregnancy plus has amazing pictures but I love the community aspect on Ovia so that’s why I like ovia more
736,736,5,2018-10-24T18:28:30.000Z,Jessikittten,Amazing!,I love this app! It’s been my go to every week to see how baby and I are doing (other than hospital trips) and I love the information they put out. It’s great stuff. The community part of the app is great for connecting with other mamas and the food safety look up is super helpful
737,737,5,2018-10-26T10:18:54.000Z,Tonka ninja truck22,Husband using app,I don’t see any reason someone would give less than 5 stars. This app is very easy to use. I enjoyed opening the app to see the progress my wife was making during both her pregnancies. I’d recommend this app for sure.
738,738,4,2020-12-11T03:04:13.000Z,Sawissa B,Easy to use,"The app recently updated but either way it’s pretty easy to use and it was no problem adjusting to the change. I like the mom community, tips, and resources this app provides. It’s very useful but they need help with naming part. The only names it showed me were top 100 popular names. That’s very limited."
739,739,3,2021-06-08T16:30:03.000Z,Jescajo24,Good app for tracking pregnancy and articles but...,Best app to track progress. The information given by week is great. But why when I go to report my birth I can’t unless I give very personal and very specific information. Location of birth..city...state...doctors name?!? I can’t complete it unless I give the info. It’s a bit too personal so I have to just delete it in the end.
740,740,5,2021-03-18T01:13:14.000Z,Charisse Hawley,The best pregnancy tracker!,"This app gives you weekly baby growth updates, plus daily tidbits about what’s happening with your baby’s growth. It’s nice to be able to read what’s going on with your little one while you’re waiting so impatiently for them to get here!"
741,741,5,2021-03-13T20:52:42.000Z,Zbmvk,Love the features!,"I love how well this keeps us updated on how our baby is growing! It’s so exciting to see the updates each week. Not to mention all the health advice, recipes, and tidbits for mom have been so helpful and exciting! And it’s all free! Highly recommend."
742,742,5,2021-03-10T03:49:03.000Z,RaveBehr,#1,Used this app through out my pregnancy and absolutely love it. Super informative and provides a lot of helpful links and resources for multiple things. And just love all the little facts it gives you about your little one as they’re growing in your tummy🥰
743,743,5,2021-01-23T03:19:15.000Z,BmFreddy,So cute!,"I love this app! For a first time pregnant momma, this has been so helpful keeping me updated with what is (or could be) going on in my body and with baby! The option to change the size comparison is adorable and I appreciate the articles posted in a regular!"
744,744,5,2020-12-19T14:20:45.000Z,nearriver,Best Pregnancy App,I immediately deleted my other apps once I saw how easy to use this interface is! Provides you with tons of information too that other apps just don’t do. I’m so glad they don’t shove ads in your face or make it complicated.
745,745,5,2020-12-18T21:32:26.000Z,Kimkimkimkimkkkkim,LOVE,"The daily emails were honestly something I looked forward to during my pregnancy! Knowing each and every days milestone was incredible. My students also loved reading this and knowing about size and other developments, it was a cool way for us to bond!"
746,746,5,2020-12-18T19:58:06.000Z,risT14,"Easy, Useful and informative",No complaints here. This app helped me through my entire pregnancy. I had so many questions and this app actually helped me detect a health problem in my pregnancy before the doctor could even catch it! HIGHLY recommend this app!
747,747,5,2020-12-17T05:10:07.000Z,JessMar92,Sweet and simple,I love that this app keeps you updated on the potential progress of your child and gives you plenty of resources to expand your knowledge. I got to watch my little one grow with there multiple options of object comparisons. Loved this app!
748,748,5,2020-07-06T16:47:40.000Z,Hardeegirl183,Love this Pregnancy Tracking App,I am using this app for the second time with my second pregnancy. I love the weekly updates and things to expect. With my first pregnancy the app told me things my body had done and it was like a light bulb! This app is my favorite for tracking pregnancy!
749,749,3,2020-07-07T11:08:18.000Z,KatieBLady120,Almost perfect,Currently 7 months along and overall I enjoy the app. I enjoy reading about my baby’s progress.
750,750,5,2018-05-01T15:24:16.000Z,Kai418,Love Ovia,I absolutely love checking my ovia app every morning to see the progress my baby is making. It’s so nice to have a comprehensive app to follow along my baby’s development. Will definitely be using for future pregnancies & will continue to share with family and friends.
751,751,2,2018-07-14T12:34:44.000Z,mayor clean pants,Only works with WiFi now,"I had Ovia with my first pregnancy and loved that I could use it to track Dr appointments, weight, blood pressure, etc. So when I found out I’m pregnant again, it was the first app I downloaded. Unfortunately it has been updated and now only works with WiFi, so I can’t just put in my info at Dr visits anymore. And I can’t access it anywhere but at home, which defeats the purpose. It’s pretty much useless to me now."
752,752,5,2018-07-18T01:25:47.000Z,MiaOurKitty,Love this app!,I’ve used this app with all three of my pregnancies and I love it! I love all the information that is provided and if you’re interested in knowing more you’re able to click on the article for more! Also the week-by-week size comparable is neat.
753,753,5,2018-09-02T12:47:03.000Z,TAR54,Informative & accurate- OVERALL LOVE!!,"Love this app!! I love the daily updates with the current symptoms I have, or how I’m feeling. Each day I learn something knew with my pregnancy progress. When I have a question I can always find it here as well. It’s a must have if you’re pregnant!"
754,754,5,2018-09-02T19:41:31.000Z,cgraha15,I love this app,"It provides so much insightful information into how my baby is growing. I love to see the comparison of the size of my baby to the animals or fruit, it gives me a pretty good idea on how big she’s getting. I also love the progression notes on how my baby’s arteries is growing. This is an awesome site."
755,755,4,2018-12-27T20:33:58.000Z,BabyyySponge,Good app plus a rant🤷‍♀️❤️,This app is a really good way of keeping track of things but if your really senstive during your pregnancy I suggest you don't use the community part of the app to ask questions because some of the women in the community part are just smartasses and think they know everything🙄🤦‍♀️ just a heads up👌
756,756,5,2019-01-26T13:57:48.000Z,71104capri,Love it.,"My doctor told me to download a different app but I love this one so much more! I track everything I eat by writing in the notes section, track daily symptoms and weight, and love the community questions and how the app works!! Favorite out of 5 pregnancy apps I tried"
757,757,5,2019-03-19T09:27:03.000Z,MASDOTL,Best pregnancy app,"By far the best pregnancy app. It has everything you could ever think of. From health and meal tracking, to appointments and note taking, as well as tip and baby updates, you won’t miss a thing. This app is great! I would also recommend the Ovia fertility tracker as well!"
758,758,5,2019-08-10T11:59:24.000Z,nat0829,Very informative,For a first time mom to be this app is very informative and has helped me a lot understand what to expect while I’m expecting and what to expect after. I also like that it has a specific list of what you can and can’t eat.
759,759,4,2019-11-07T03:03:56.000Z,EmmaCD333,Great info but so many glitches!,"I love love love this app and it has been so hopeful to me, but man oh man does it have glitches! 9/10 it freezes when I open it and I can’t get it to start back up until several hours later. I never used to have this problem with it until recently."
760,760,5,2017-09-19T02:43:40.000Z,elle103,Best pregnancy app of all,"I've tried all of them...and this is by far my favorite. I still use a couple others but this is my most used for logging data, appointments and reading about all things pregnancy and baby related. Amazing recipes too!"
761,761,5,2017-09-22T02:43:49.000Z,AshChilds,Best pregnancy app there is.,"This is my second child and I am 31 weeks pregnant, and I have downloaded so many different pregnancy apps but this one for exceeds any expectations I had. There was always something missing on the other apps but this covers everything I love it!"
762,762,5,2017-11-05T12:37:24.000Z,LRhea93,Love it!!,I used the Ovia Fertility app while TTC Baby #2! It helped me keep track of my ovulation dates & now I have a clear idea on when I conceived and it brought me to this app & I plan on using it throughout my pregnancy. It’s my favorite out there so far! Definitely worth checking out!:) Thank you Ovia!
763,763,2,2017-11-29T02:51:13.000Z,RyanSkye,Can't get the app to stay open.,I love this app but have not been able to get it to open without deleting and reinstalling it. It is so frustrating! Then after I reinstall I can open it 2-3 times before it stops opening again. Like I said I love this app but I am ready to get rid of it for good because I can't trust it to actually open when I need it too. If the company can fix this I will be a customer for good.
764,764,5,2018-01-28T02:22:55.000Z,Mikeyj777,Incredible and a Joy to Use,"Thank you for working so hard on this app!  It is so well put together, and we look forward to the pictures and information about our baby’s development each week."
765,765,5,2021-03-12T03:44:36.000Z,@Low CARb Living,Love this app!!,"I look forward to seeing what my baby is the size of every week, but I love reading all the information they provide for that week too. The food and medication lists are incredible!! You want this app if you’re pregnant!"
766,766,5,2021-01-22T21:09:19.000Z,EB62819,"Great, simple updates","Easy to use and just enough information. I like the daily updates on baby’s growth, my symptoms and an extra pregnancy article. There’s lots more in the app to dig through when you have questions too!"
767,767,5,2020-12-11T03:24:05.000Z,Hsbedklamq744789,Good app!,I love this app for tracking my pregnancy. I love the pics of the baby’s size easy week. I also really love the calendar so you can write in your dr appts and you can also track you feelings your food and water and other things each day.
768,768,5,2020-02-21T16:17:55.000Z,Heather Cliff,Great app,"This is app is one of my favorites for so many reasons.  Helps track my health, symptoms baby kicks, baby growth, milestones and so much more.  I love it.  It’s like having a healthcare provider with you all the time giving you feedback.  This app puts my mind at ease and is so helpful!"
769,769,3,2019-07-29T01:20:51.000Z,WonderStitch,Great app but you can’t personalize a ton,"I love this app for the general information, fun factoids, and great links to additional articles. However, I’m once again diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum and with the consensus pictures of food etc I can hardly scroll through the app anymore. I wish that you could personalize it a bit more for custom needs, but as a general app it’s great."
770,770,5,2017-10-19T06:08:13.000Z,Mackuhluh,Love this app!,"I absolutely love how informative Ovia is! The small daily facts are always something I look forward into reading, and just the overall flow and layout of this app is simple and great to look through! I highly suggest using this, I believe you'll love it too :)"
771,771,5,2017-12-07T05:06:45.000Z,Krispy Ki,Great app,"I love the app! It's informative, it's understandable, and you even get coupons sometimes on your home page. My husband has the app on his phone also so he can track our baby's growth and he likes learning about babies and the female body. Good stuff."
772,772,5,2018-01-04T03:55:42.000Z,Zoeyeyes,Daily updates!,"I Love checking on baby developments day by day! Most apps including this one have large updates every week, but the daily milestones are so exciting and keep me checking back often to see what’s happening next."
773,773,1,2018-04-18T12:22:18.000Z,hjgdygju,Don’t add another pregnancy,"I loved this app for my first pregnancy and when I found out I was pregnant again, I wanted to use it. The app gave me the option to add a pregnancy and it ended up deleting EVERYTHING from my last pregnancy. Everything from her first heartbeat to the first time I felt her kicks. It never told me it would erase anything, just gave me the option to add. I’m not sure I’ve ever been this upset. There should be a warning because I lost precious information I’ll never get back 😭😭😭"
774,774,5,2018-04-27T02:59:57.000Z,Adikatesmommy17,It stays with you through it all!,"I had Ovia fertility, once I got pregnant it switched me to Ovia pregnancy. Now that I have my daughter it switched it to Ovia parenting. I can’t explain how much I love these apps! And it’s very cool that you can go back on any of these apps and look at the history! Love this so much!!"
775,775,3,2018-07-24T14:20:33.000Z,shyann19,Not accurate on size but amazing app overall,"The size they guess your baby to be about the size of isn’t entirely accurate but the app itself is amazing. You can customize it, punch in different things like what you are today or weight gain or milestones in your pregnancy. Great app just like I said not very accurate on sizing, it will say they’re bigger than they really are"
776,776,5,2018-09-02T01:03:40.000Z,Aintnobodygottimefordis,Love it!,It’s been 10 years since I was last pregnant so I definitely needed lots of reminders about what pregnancy was going to be like now. Ovia app was my favorite because it’s so thorough and interactive. Definitely would recommend to any new moms or moms returning for a 2-3 pregnancy!
777,777,4,2018-10-01T04:21:09.000Z,Taddy8,Love it!,"I love this app. It’s been super helpful with all the articles! They have so much information a first time mom like me needs! The only issue I have is that I can’t easily maneuver through the articles. There should be a way to bookmark them for future reading, especially for ones with recipes."
778,778,5,2019-02-20T05:21:18.000Z,CassieFoodFitnessandFun,Love!,I LOVE having Ovia. I am currently 34 weeks pregnant and started using it from a friends recommendation around 12 weeks of pregnancy. I love the daily facts that it gives as well as the weekly milestones of how you are doing and how baby is doing. I would highly suggest this app for pregnancy !
779,779,4,2019-04-23T16:16:42.000Z,GillyDN,Weight tracker,"I like this app but a suggestion I would like to make us to be able to see a weight tracker history/list rather than the graph. In the last week, the goal line keeps covering the weight entry and you can’t see the number."
780,780,5,2017-10-02T11:52:19.000Z,km2400o,Love it!,"I found out I was pregnant in April at 4 weeks. I have loved the app, it has given me a peace of mind, helped me prepare and just kept me feeling like I was getting to know my baby boy even before I could feel him moving and kicking. I highly recommend using this app!"
781,781,5,2021-01-22T21:50:03.000Z,aimann721,Love it!,"I downloaded four different pregnancy apps since all a quite different, and Ovia by far is my favorite. It helps you easily track things and I love how they provide you with information week by week and even day by day!"
782,782,5,2021-01-21T14:05:27.000Z,angiep16,Easy to use,"I like the ease of daily logging with this app because there are a lot of choices that seem relevant without searching. The features are basic and simple to use. I like the emails they send, and so does my husband."
783,783,5,2021-01-16T09:03:38.000Z,simizo1,Excellent App,It really educated me with the weekly updates of what’s going on with my body and the articles on Mental health etc make it very holistic
784,784,5,2020-12-20T16:23:01.000Z,blessed1820,Awesome Tracker,This is a great way to stay healthy during pregnancy. I used it for my first child and now I am using it for my second child. It keeps me updated and helps me to keep track of important appointments. The community chat is an absolute bonus support.
785,785,5,2020-12-19T02:13:24.000Z,Cori girl,LOVE!,I absolutely LOVED this app when I was pregnant with my daughter!! It was so fun to see that growing hand/foot and see the comparisons with fruit etc to the size of baby! Plus it helped shed light for an anxious first time mama about what were regular symptoms in pregnancy versus what may not be. Definitely recommend!
786,786,5,2020-12-19T01:01:10.000Z,Sara Dip,Important to understand what is happening,I found the app very helpful with its information and tips along the way. It is important to understand what is happening while it’s happening so you make better choices.
787,787,5,2020-12-18T20:11:18.000Z,corrynadiaz2,Love this app!,I used it before I got pregnant and it’s been amazing to track my little nugget and it gives amazing options on what fruit or cute pastry your baby has grown to! Also it sends so many reminders to keep you updated on baby and prenatal must haves!
788,788,5,2019-12-20T13:38:46.000Z,Flaminghands,Best pregnancy app,"I’ve used several pregnancy apps to find the right one and Ovia has surpassed them all with the info, daily updates, pictures, etc. Its been so fun sharing every daily development with my husband. We love this app for our little Rainbow baby."
789,789,5,2019-11-11T02:54:04.000Z,Yayynicolee,The best,"We used Ovia to track my cycles while trying to conceive, and now this to track my pregnancy! I love the visuals of the growth, and the info on how the baby is growing and changing each week. I also like how it explains what the mom could experience that week too. Great app!"
790,790,5,2018-06-03T23:52:59.000Z,Jupiterbean,Came back,"This is my 2nd pregnancy using this app. My other kids love the themes with which to compare the growing baby, and the content is free, which is amazing. Tried some other apps, and decided I was looking for this stuff this one offered all along."
791,791,5,2018-10-11T21:01:07.000Z,VeggieNP,Much more focused on the pregnancy itself.,"Some of the other apps are more about advice, fashion, etc which I don’t find useful in monitoring the pregnancy itself. This app is more focused, you can keep track of your symptoms, doctors appointments, eating habits, there’s even a kick counter."
792,792,5,2018-10-25T11:34:46.000Z,Adrm9491,I love Ovia and you will to!,"This is my first pregnancy, we thought I couldn’t have babies and here I am nearly 8 weeks pregnant! I like ovia because not only does it tell me how my baby is growing but it tells me how I should be doing and how I’m growing as a mommy!"
793,793,5,2018-11-02T14:33:31.000Z,brittny renee,Love it!,"I’ve actually been issuing Ovia for a while, I was using the fertility app to track my ovulation which helped my husband & I get pregnant! So of course my first choice was to use the Ovia pregnancy app. I love both, they’re both easy to use & it makes it fun to input info daily!"
794,794,5,2018-11-22T20:06:55.000Z,J.RosaMuerta,No complaints ! Very helpful.,I’m not a first time mom but my 1st is six so it feels like the first time all over again . I love the access to the community the day by day tidbits etc also coming from the fertility app to this one also makes me a bit bias maybe lol
795,795,5,2018-12-20T12:21:15.000Z,abalabashabalaba ding dong,I love this app!,"I’ve used this app for my last two pregnancies and I absolutely love everything about it, I love how it shows examples of how big babies hand and feet are getting, and you can just customize it pretty much any way you want it to be!"
796,796,5,2019-01-12T01:58:08.000Z,Missqueentutt,Best Pregnancy App!,"This is the most thorough pregnancy app out there! I used it with my first and now with my second. Every bit of information it provides is important and useful. Each week, I can’t wait to read all about my growing baby!"
797,797,5,2019-03-08T15:31:19.000Z,BonnieBobbie,Works,I hate reading reviews where I don’t know if they are true or not but this app helped me conceive and I went to doctor and they agree with the app on how far along I am! After 2months of keeping up with period I got pregnant now it’s on point with my doctor!
798,798,5,2019-03-19T19:57:19.000Z,shieldsy257,Loved it!,When I found I was pregnant I downloaded this app and many more. I found this app to be the best one there is. The hints and tips were helpful since it was my first pregnancy. I loved it! I loved that it took all the pictures and made a video timeline of how my bump grew!
799,799,5,2019-03-20T04:41:02.000Z,Toni904,Best app ever,This app is the best app ever. When I found out that I was pregnant my cousin referred me to this app and ever since I’ve been using it it’s been there helping me every step. I enjoy talking to the people on the app and how they are there when I have similar questions to their’s.
800,800,5,2017-10-26T08:58:10.000Z,Kit kat mom,Very Helpful,"Being on my forth and final pregnancy has been a bit scary with all the new changes, but thanks to Ovia I am in the know of all things available for this pregnancy. Very helpful tool and fun to see my baby and understanding my symptoms! Highly recommend this app to ALL moms."
801,801,3,2018-01-03T00:47:30.000Z,mrsprice23,Love this App however....,I really love this app along with the other Ovia apps. However the last couple of weeks it has been impossible to open. When I first open the app the page loads for about 20-30 seconds and automatically closes. It used to open if I tried it a second time and now it never wants to open :(
802,802,5,2018-02-04T17:11:23.000Z,NautiBox Bailey,Nice 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾,This is the Best I’ve seen yet... I haven had a baby in 12 years &&& this app has so much random info && reminders that I never thought about needing to know ... It’s truly helpful...  when I have my daughter in June I will definitely use the other app as well...
803,803,4,2018-02-10T04:59:35.000Z,painterpants,"Smooth UI, too many ads","Overall I like this app and it’s fun to get cheerful notifications ‘hey gorgeous, how are you feeling today?’ But there are a lot of ads for pottery barn kids, updating your health insurance and employer info to unlock perks, etc. I don’t know, it’s one of the best pregnancy apps out there but it just seems underwhelming nonetheless."
804,804,5,2018-04-04T03:55:33.000Z,Cari2416,Best pregnancy app,"Of the 4 pregnancy apps I downloaded in my first trimester, this is my FAVORITE! Super user friendly, easy to track diet, symptoms, etc. Great information each day, helpful articles and user surveys, and super fun to see how my baby compares in size weekly! Love the weekly videos from Gina too!"
805,805,5,2021-01-23T00:07:37.000Z,Skylar Rolfe,Amazing!,I used this app with all 3 of my pregnancies and it was the most informative of the trackers I used. I liked that it would send me a notification when I entered a new trimester and I could personalize the app to my liking. I recommend this app to everyone I know!
806,806,5,2020-12-18T22:15:47.000Z,sofiamaria,"Easy, fun, informative",I used this every day when I was pregnant. I like that it gives updates and tracks baby’s size. I didn’t use the calendar to enter my appointments but I like that it has that feature. I like the coaching as well.
807,807,5,2020-12-18T14:28:46.000Z,szinkl,Easy to use,"It’s easy to use and figure out! I like the baby development, the nutrition tips, and the explanation of body changes. I also like that I can track how I’m feeling and be able to take that to my doctor if necessary."
808,808,4,2020-05-12T07:06:09.000Z,haylee!!!,The community needs some freshening up!,"Overall it’s a great app to track your pregnancy, although the community tab needs some changes. I wish it wasn’t JUST polls. I wish you could choose to do a poll. Or just tell a story. It needs more room for characters as well. And monitored pictures ."
809,809,2,2020-09-08T00:16:53.000Z,Rhellis,Too many diet culture messages,"This app is fine, but I’m a little sick of all the judgmental, diet culture messages that pop"
810,810,5,2018-01-17T13:43:40.000Z,Mich Mama,The perfect pregnancy tracker,"Beautifully designed and easily customizable, this app is perfect for pregnancy. There are so many useful features, that it's the only app you need during pregnancy."
811,811,5,2018-01-30T03:51:44.000Z,Boss Ladii,Love!!,"Love this app. Accuracy is ON POINT. My OB asked me what app I was using. All of my dates etc. were comparable to her findings. I did have to do my part to get accurate results. However, overall great app. Used them to track fertility and now using them to track pregnancy. I’m due Sept. 2018 yay!!"
812,812,5,2018-06-01T13:28:30.000Z,tattooedmum17,Best Preggo App,I LOVE this app. My partner loves this app because it sends him updates to his email so he can keep track! We enjoy the random fun sized they have each week for size of baby and the information isn’t overbearing and accurate. If you’re pregnant; this is your app💗
813,813,5,2018-07-05T18:36:19.000Z,HanhMorgan,Love this app!,"I love the helpful, short articles about pregnancy, health, nutrition, etc. I also love tracking my baby’s growth weekly. I haven’t tried any of the recipes but they look delicious, and many are vegetarian. Love this app and can’t recommend it enough for expecting mothers!"
814,814,5,2018-08-30T13:40:09.000Z,Bed bath and beyond oh ya,LOVE IT!,"As a new mom-to-be this app has been my right hand so far. It's nice having it especially during this time when others don't know. It gives me new info every day, and I LOVE the safe food feature. Can't wait to keep learning and loving with Ovia 💕"
815,815,5,2019-01-30T03:10:26.000Z,aries0416,Best pregnancy app,When I first found out I was pregnant downloaded the app and loved everything about it. To the weekly updates and different topics every morning was amazing and was able to customize was a cute little bonus
816,816,5,2019-02-13T05:38:24.000Z,babe luv,This app is wonderful,I love this app... although I am a mother of six I don’t remember everything and this app is my map through this last pregnancy. It gives me day by day how baby is growing and how I can stay healthy and keep baby healthy while being pregnant..
817,817,5,2019-02-24T13:10:16.000Z,GingerCrazyFast,Great Period and Pregnancy App,"I used Ovia to track my cycles when we were trying to conceive and found it very useful. When I became pregnant I downloaded several different pregnancy tracker apps but Ovia was easily my favorite, I deleted the rest. It’s easy to interact with and very visually appealing."
818,818,5,2021-01-23T01:57:14.000Z,MegEcc,Great app,Love this app. Only thing I wish you could type in to go directly to an exact date and year. I used this app for two pregnancies and had to scroll all the way back four years to previous pregnancy
819,819,2,2021-01-04T05:41:19.000Z,Kskgsglxt,Frustrated,It seems pretty basic and easy I just wish I could trust the due date estimate more. It asks you your last cycle and conception date but it won’t accept what I put in as correct. It’s a little frustrating and that alone is putting my pregnancy 2 weeks ahead. I’m only 4 weeks now but it says I’m 6 weeks 5 days. It hasn’t even been 6 weeks since the conception date?
820,820,5,2018-11-19T13:16:22.000Z,NewLife34!!,BEST pregnancy app,I looked around the different pregnancy apps as soon as I found out I was pregnant...this one won and it has not disappointed!!! It lets you nick name your baby then gives daily updates using the nick name! Makes it special to you!
821,821,5,2018-11-20T15:48:53.000Z,Jenaeliz,Great app!,I downloaded this when I found out I was pregnant. I have been using it now for about 18 weeks and I love getting the updates every week about the baby! It’s been a great resource for me as well about symptoms and talking to the community.
822,822,5,2019-02-12T23:57:12.000Z,jordi 6.5.18,Week to week check in with the family,Every Tuesday it’s such a fun experience logging in to the Ovia pregnancy app and checking the baby’s growth with the family. Seeing what has changed with him and with me . Also reassured me that what I am experiencing is normal .
823,823,5,2019-03-31T14:45:53.000Z,dbojkov,Love this app!,Recommended by a friend. I’m an “Old Skool” mom. But when surprise baby number 3 came along I had to get with the times. Love how this app takes you on the journey of what’s going on inside your body throughout theses 40 weeks of miracle baby making!
824,824,3,2019-05-27T10:58:20.000Z,Not a bridezilla,Love this app but...,"I love this app and the information it has at my fingertips. I wish I could customize it more though, I am tired of seeing the “did you take your vitamin” across the top before I read anything else. I wish I could just delete it and the other reminders since I find them more annoying than helpful."
825,825,5,2020-12-14T05:38:18.000Z,natzz77,Great easy to use app,Loved using this app my last pregnancy. I also use the fertility tracker to keep track of my cycle while not pregnant. Lots of good info on the stage of pregnancy you are at. I liked to use it to see what foods to avoid. Great app highly recommend
826,826,5,2020-12-12T01:09:07.000Z,Gantt2020,So much fun and informative,"Loved watching my pregnancy on this app! This app helps you feel more connected to your baby and it gives you tons of tips, advices and even recipes to make sure your pregnancy goes as smooth as possible!"
827,827,5,2020-02-16T15:00:01.000Z,Giraffe0415,Amazing app!,"This app is amazing! It has everything needed to track your pregnancy, add information, learn along the way & provides you with awesome resources! I’ve literally used this app every single day, since I found out about my little guy!"
828,828,5,2019-12-12T12:55:14.000Z,charlie&zo,App is wonderful!,"Not only does it keep track of my (& baby’s) development throughout my pregnancy, it also provides several health tips. So from everything including nutritional tips, to more serious matters such as mental health, this app has it all!"
829,829,4,2019-06-11T14:56:11.000Z,Prime must have,Informative,"I found this app very I formative for my first child, but with my second it was just a replete. I wish it had more/any information on c section births. I was totally u prepared for my first emergency csection and knowing the second birth will be via csection it would helpfullbif there was a place to read more info on that."
830,830,3,2017-09-24T05:22:44.000Z,PnutbutterRunner,This app has good info. However.,"The article writing is mediocre at best. Almost every article I read has some sort of typo. The glossary of terms, as well as the foods list is full of errors, too. I know it's an app with a ton of content to manage, but it's annoying as a reader to see so many flaws. I shouldn't have to proofread the content I consume as I'm reading it."
831,831,1,2017-12-28T13:53:32.000Z,Alexxxandra311,Fun for 1st and 2nd trimester only,This app was full of exciting super fun information at the beginning of my pregnancy. But now that I’m in the 3rd trimester it’s literally just telling me the same facts everyday. Needless to say I’m super disappointed that it isn’t a good app for the entire pregnancy and will be deleting it. Like how many times do I need to read that my baby has an immune system that will continue to develop until after his birth? 3rd trimester expecting moms deserve exciting new facts too...
832,832,5,2018-05-17T11:34:12.000Z,Belle32801,Great App!,Great app with awesome updates daily and weekly. It’s so fun to open every day and learn something new about the development of the baby. I love how personal this app allows you to make your pregnancy by choosing colors and different size reference themes and naming your baby.
833,833,5,2018-06-20T14:55:12.000Z,1fluteplayer,Fantastic! Love it!,I absolutely love this app. Loved Ovia Fertility and now In love with this app. The daily updates are wonderful! Especially since this is my first pregnancy it’s great for a quick reference and the opportunity to connect with other moms to be is so helpful. Highly recommend!!
834,834,5,2018-09-19T14:28:40.000Z,Silvermino,Love it!,This app has been very helpful and informative during my second pregnancy. I’ve used the community feature to communicate with other mothers and it’s helped me feel so much more connected and gotten me through rough times.
835,835,5,2021-03-28T02:48:58.000Z,arianasparks,Best Baby App!!!,I absolutely love this baby app and I used it with my past 2 pregnancies! I just found out I’m pregnant with baby #3 and will be using it again! I recommend this app to all my mama friends! It’s full of information and is so easy to navigate! Love love love this app!!!
836,836,5,2021-03-27T14:04:22.000Z,Nicole & Little one,Fun and easy to use!,"This app really does have everything. I can track my weight, sleep, and diet. Looking for baby names on this app is so fun and the articles and surveys really do help me navigate my pregnancy! I check my app multiple times a day. Truly love it."
837,837,5,2021-03-13T13:13:11.000Z,soon-2-b mama,Daily Updates,My husband and I LOVE getting daily updates about our growing little one. It’s so nice to feel so connected and a part of the process. Especially for him as he can not yet feel her moving around.
838,838,5,2021-03-11T08:33:57.000Z,kaiques mom,Ovia Pregnancy & Parenting,"I’ve used this app along with the parenting app for YEARS. It’s so easy to navigate through, and the information is always spot on to whatever week I wa s during pregnancy or the week my babies have been on. I go to this app for so much advice."
839,839,5,2021-03-10T03:02:38.000Z,alo0923,Amazing app,This is my first baby and I have loved using this app to track how big baby is and reading all the articles it provides is honestly just a big help. Definitely an app I would recommend for your pregnancy.
840,840,3,2018-04-09T08:06:30.000Z,Bubbubbbubbbb,Overall fine,"I habitually checked the app everyday to get fun little it’s bits, however I’m not 38 weeks and I’ve known my baby is a boy since week 22.  It still refers to “her” which makes it way less personal and I’m honestly annoyed by it now.  Why is there not a “milestone” to have the developers change girl to boy or visa versa after you’ve found out the sex!"
841,841,5,2018-08-12T16:10:54.000Z,woozi vert,Amazing,"I’ve tried a few pregnancy apps and none compared to Ovia. This app is absolutely wonderful. It’s helpful and informative. I love the Food Safety, Medication, and Symptoms Lookup options that’s available. It also shows you what to expect week by week. This app is awesome!!!"
842,842,5,2018-10-08T16:12:21.000Z,Mzmzmzmzmzmz121212,Great app to read accurate and relevant information for each week,"Beautiful graphics, easy to use and log information from weight to mood, from exercise to blood pressure."
843,843,5,2019-02-07T22:52:53.000Z,empfieldken,Very helpfull,When I found out I was pregnant this app made it easy to know how big baby is and helpful tips with morning sickness and cravings. They continue to let me know how big baby is and what organs and functions baby can do at certain stages.
844,844,1,2019-02-20T01:33:46.000Z,queenbarajas,Horrible assistance,"I loved this app until I was recently banned from the community, I no longer have access to ask questions or answer questions. When I reached out to Ovia for help, they simply said I violated the rules and the ban would not be lifted. I was surprised with with their response as I have not been rude, offensive or anything of that sort. It is very disappointing that a company would take it upon themselves to ban participants who have not broken the community rules"
845,845,5,2019-03-06T18:25:11.000Z,mombie2018,Pregnancy app,I love this app completely! I do wish examples of ultra sound pictures were available for how the baby looks each week but other then that I’m in love with all of the features this app has to offer🧡
846,846,5,2019-05-27T15:39:11.000Z,tahira saddiqa,Best app,I start using Ovia ovulation tracking app and I hopefully conceive and then they transfer me into ovia pregnancy app and I must say it’s one of my favorite app n I recommend to all my frndz and family females who really want to conceive or track there healthy pregnancy thanks ovia for doing best for us❤️
847,847,5,2021-01-22T22:37:19.000Z,Logan's Mama- Courtney,Great!,This app is wonderful if you wanna keep track of what’s going on with your pregnancy each week! I love being able to show my family the actual size of the baby’s hand and feet. Highly recommend!!!
848,848,4,2019-11-15T03:36:44.000Z,a19474084,Ovia pregnancy review,"Love to track my pregnancy and the information it allows me to track as well as the weekly updates and options to log fun milestones. Unfortunately, this latest update has my app crashing each and every time I try to open it so it’s now an unusable app."
849,849,1,2019-08-31T14:44:55.000Z,Dr. Trul,Information way off and they sell your data,"Would be nice if they’re calculations weren’t off and they didn’t sell your information to hospitals. They are always 2 weeks ahead which is extremely misleading, and they ask way personal questions which they use to help hospitals selling your personal data. There is a whole article on this app I recommend yall read before downloading. Look it up. Their intentions are not pure. Be careful."
850,850,5,2017-09-25T02:15:35.000Z,Zodillin,Loved it in mi first not so much in the 2nd,"It's a great app useful and fun. So many functions, although now that I'm going through my second pregnancy the information is not so interesting since I know already must of it. Still I'm going to use it anyways!"
851,851,5,2018-01-25T01:36:30.000Z,Snewty29,3rd baby using Ovia,"I had my first baby in 2015, second 2016, and now I’m on my third in 2018...I used ovia on all 3 and it just keeps getting better!  Thank you for making my journey into motherhood so much fun and so informative.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart!"
852,852,3,2018-01-31T14:11:41.000Z,Blah 598769,"Good app, crashes a lot.","It's been a really good app and I love all the features it has. Finally made it to my 35weeks with the app, now I suddenly can't even open it without it crashing on me. I open it and it closes, shuts down or freezes. Not fun when I only have 5weeks left with it. All and all though good app until it crashes on you."
853,853,5,2018-02-25T13:03:00.000Z,Jenny60062,Great app!,"I loved Ovia and now using Ovia Pregnancy. It’s easy to track data, change things, and gives great info about what’s going on with baby. It’s easy to use and very customizable. Much better than other pregnancy apps I’ve used in the past."
854,854,5,2021-03-12T03:53:08.000Z,HaYHayAnd,Amazing,I love this app. It really helps me get to know what is happening during my pregnancy. I feel connected to the articles and I can see and track moods and food and my weight. Also the baby name feature is amazing as well.
855,855,5,2021-03-10T20:24:29.000Z,Alexis223311,Best Pregnancy App!,I was using the baby center app to track my pregnancy and found Ovia Pregnancy through a facebook group. What attracted me to the app was the size comparisons each week. They weren’t the usual fruit/vegetables but instead animals. it added a fun touch to my pregnancy.
856,856,5,2021-01-26T13:32:55.000Z,chelz198362,Easy to use and informative,"I used this app during my last pregnancy and will use it again this time. I love all the updates, the nutrition tips, activity tips and the information about baby’s development."

858,858,5,2021-01-15T02:41:18.000Z,Alwaystrulyours,Love this app!,I downloaded this app at the very beginning of my pregnancy and have enjoyed it the whole time through. I’m about to have my first and appreciated all the education i received through this app. Highly recommend!
859,859,5,2020-12-24T13:45:32.000Z,Evans_J,Jacqueline Evans,I have literally used this app every single time I’ve been pregnant and it’s my favorite app ever. Highly recommend to new mommies or ones that are still making babies :). I’m high risk and it helps keep me informed about any issues.
860,860,4,2018-08-23T06:14:59.000Z,princesssparklepaw,Nice app but glitchy,"I downloaded this app when I found out I was pregnant and enjoyed the information. Unfortunately, I miscarried. When I go to report the pregnancy loss, the app closes down. Please fix this so I stop getting email and push notifications about the pregnancy that has ended."
861,861,5,2018-09-08T05:14:19.000Z,Jennabo321,Love this app,"I’m almost 7 weeks pregnant with mine and my fiancée’s first child and I downloaded this app and it’s amazing, it lets me know all the symptoms I’m experiencing are completely normal and I can also talk to other first time parents!

It’s incredible they are kind and not intrusive at all!"
863,863,5,2019-03-15T13:43:51.000Z,OJP11212019,Top notch,I have downloaded multiple pregnancy apps and this is by far my favorite. I love that there are daily updates instead of weekly updates. The information is always very helpful and informative!
864,864,5,2020-12-18T23:03:42.000Z,hywnchika,Favorite Pregnancy App,I was using around 4-5 different pregnancy apps while I was pregnant but Ovia is my favorite. I loved checking the progress of my baby’s development and even seeing the size his hands and feet are at diff times. Love love love it and will use it for all of my pregnancies.
865,865,5,2020-12-17T16:01:42.000Z,Barrbiie89,App,Absolutely love this app and I love all the little updates it gives you and I look forward to me week change to see all the new developments with baby and what size baby is it’s an awesome app plus the articles are great as well
866,866,5,2020-03-28T15:24:16.000Z,megztnieh,LOVE!,used this app for both my baby girls and nothing but good things. love the daily updates and cute features. my daughter loves looking to see how big baby’s feet and hands are (and so do i)! very personal and love checking it for more info every week
867,867,2,2020-06-22T16:12:12.000Z,cs133joel,Not Very Educational,As a second time mom the only reason I use the app is to see what cute things my baby is the size of. Each week my baby seems to grow and then shrink based on the random and inaccurate comparisons...but still fun. The advice is pretty laughable. For example week 39 says the first year of baby’s life will probably be hard because they will cry so much but they will be cute.....how is this helpful?!
868,868,5,2020-02-10T14:28:14.000Z,The savings shopper,This app is great,When we found out we were pregnant the wife loaded this on my phone. I honestly was like who needs this. But the updates and the information it gives is actually pretty great.
869,869,5,2019-07-12T20:36:00.000Z,BrookeVislay,So helpful!,This app has helps me tremendously! The articles and updates daily give me peace of mind and help me know what’s happening with my body and my baby! The food safety and medication safety look up are such great tools to use and have available!
