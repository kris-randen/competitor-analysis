The prompting for a review was still annoying but I appreciate the response so I‚Äôll change it to 5 stars."
1,1,4,2017-08-03T14:10:22.000Z,Bewildered1965,Helpful and Informative,"Fooducate helps me be more aware of every bite I put in my mouth, because I know I will have to enter it into the app. I like that it also helps me understand more about the quality of ingredients and nutrients I'm consuming. I wish that it had an easy way to know more about a food before adding to my daily intake. I find that I have to add a food first in order to see just how it will affect the daily goals, nutrition info, etc. It would be helpful to me to be able to look at that detailed info as I try to decide what to choose for snacks and meals. The feature may be there, but if it is I haven't found it yet. I've been using the app a little over a week and have lost over a pound, so I'm seeing good results. It reminds me of when I used Weight Watchers points tracking, which also worked well for me. I also like the diet tips, where I have read some interesting information. The notifications are nice to help me remember to log in each meal before I forget what I ate. This is a good solid app. I have also found it worth the extra money to unlock the premium features. I plan to continue using this one!"
2,2,5,2020-01-14T13:25:44.000Z,HGM889,5-stars!!,"I absolutely love this app! I downloaded Fooducate a while back when I had a bit of extra weight I wanted to lose and fell in love with it. It really helped me become more aware of the food I was eating and the different ways food labels trick us into eating unhealthy foods. I scan literally every new food I choose when I‚Äôm in the supermarket to make sure I am keeping in line with my health goals. Anytime I hear about new nutrition trends/ingredients/products, Fooducate is the first place I go to check it out.  I also love how the app shows me if a food I scan has nightshades in it. I have a major food sensitivity to nightshades and they are often hidden in the ingredients, so this makes my life way easier! This app has changed the way I look at the foods I eat and helped me so much in my health journey."
3,3,3,2018-07-01T20:25:12.000Z,TOPW_QOH,Issues,"Many of the foods I eat are not in the database. Many of the foods that are in the database have the wrong nutrition information also. This has messed up my information, but now that I realize I double check the nutrition label and enter the nutrition information myself. When entering the information Vitamins A and C cannot be included in the nutrition information because there is no place for them. It would be helpful to include vitamins and minerals in the nutrition information. Apple HealthKit does not update when you delete something it remains in there. It would be nice to be able to see the carb count and other nutrition information per meal instead of and/or in addition to the total amount per day. A new day begins at 12:00 EST and ends at 11:59 p.m. EST, but the app does not adhere to this as it remains on the day before calling it today when it is well into the next day. The ability to print a report from ‚ÄúAll Time‚Äù, 90 days, 1 month, 14 days, and 7 days would be helpful. For privacy the app should allow for a passcode on the iPhone app."
4,4,1,2019-02-03T02:38:38.000Z,frustratedUser1900,Awfully small database,"The concept is great which is why I ended up buying a one year membership but you either have to cook all your meals (which I often do on weekdays) or buy a meal at a very unhealthy store like McDonalds or taco bell or a packaged frozen dinner (which is very unhealthy and they acknowledge it too) for them to figure out your calorie intake. There is no middle ground. I went out to a Mexican place for lunch today as it‚Äôs the weekend and shared a plate of nachos with my friend but there‚Äôs no way of estimating my calorie consumption unless I know the portion size of each ingredient unless I am willing to go eat at tacobell. Their grocery list is also very small, most of the healthier brands don‚Äôt appear on their database. So I would have to either type in my calorie intake manually or buy a mass produced alternative listed in their database, neither of which sounds appealing to me. If you expect me to use the app everyday for a long time, you should make it super easy to add my consumption and estimate my calorie intake. I am just a week in to my membership and I already regret my purchase."
5,5,5,2018-02-23T04:42:17.000Z,Eyalkr1,This app changed my life,"For years, I had all the intentions of buying and eating healthy food - but I was mislead by the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù brands. When I realized that you need  to check the labels and read ingredients - I was frustrated that it takes long time and learning (eg, more than 20 names to sugars are used just to hide the fact that a product contains lots of it üôÅ)."

I told all my friends and family members to download it. A few days later my mom said I put her on a diet and that she is eating more healthy. That's when I decided to download the app too and let me tell you: Fooducate is an app that I love because it improves the health of the people that I care about. I'll help the Fooducate app out by sending products their team hasn't posted info about yet. You are excused to leave the Fooducate app page on the app store only if you are a certified healthatrician. Download Fooducate. Do it for your health! And tell all the people in your circle about it and make everyone healthy! Thank you, Fooducate team, for making more people healthy! üåü"

8,8,3,2019-09-23T23:06:58.000Z,kittykat12101,Good structure but very bare bones,"This app has one of the most comprehensive food rating system along with a really wide variety of foods which I really like about it, but other than that it‚Äôs features are limited. I wish you were able to track steps like you could on the app I was using before this because most of my exercise I get from walking and it‚Äôs hard to do the math for how many calories I‚Äôve burned without knowing. Additionally it‚Äôs super frustrating that the main measurement used in logging food is ounces. If I measure myself out a half a cup of carrots I have no clue how many ounces that is because I don‚Äôt have a food scale! Because of this I have to go back and forth between different apps to get the basic features I need but keep the insight that this app gives which could honestly be easily solved by just adding more features. I look forward to the day I can give this 5 stars!"
9,9,2,2020-08-23T16:11:05.000Z,Tpuhl17,Long time user,"Loved this app when I started using nearly 8 years ago. 5 star loyal customer. Now, I have way to much food data that clutters up my ‚Äúrecent‚Äù foods with no way to delete them. I‚Äôve asked, but still don‚Äôt know why users can‚Äôt delete foods from their data."
10,10,4,2017-07-16T22:27:39.000Z,rungirl39,Happy with the app,"I like that this app allows me to easily track my food intake, which is super helpful when trying to lose weight. I don't necessarily count calories, but instead prefer to eat a moderate amount of whole foods that include a lot of healthy fats. The app holds me accountable so that I don't indulge too much in unhealthy snacks that slowly creep up around my waist line. I make most of my own food so I am happy that they have the ""user added"" option. The ability to enter in my mood is a great feature as well. Just the act of recording moments of boredom, anger and even my sleep patterns help me to keep my emotions in check, as well as provide a resource for me to review too see if any of my eating habits change my sleep quality or contribute to mood swings. Thanks for the easy to use health tracker!"
11,11,5,2017-10-30T13:46:12.000Z,Sully2306,Great App,This is a great app for really understanding what you are putting into your body. I love that it also gives you healthier alternatives to replace unhealthy foods with. It‚Äôs so easy to scan the barcode of the food you want to know more about and instantly you can see the grade of the food and why it received the grade it did. There are so many hidden potential dangers in our foods today. If your scanned item isn‚Äôt in their system you can have them add it by submitting some data to the makers of the app and they will return with your item added and graded. Fantastic app! It makes transitioning to healthier eating seem more attainable by providing knowledge and makes it fun because it‚Äôs interactive.
12,12,3,2018-06-19T18:25:38.000Z,Chocoloco47,Food tracking needs more detail,"The scanning via camera of foods is awesome, but this needs more details when it comes to food logging. For example, one can only log on a mobile device. The option to log on a desktop would make this process faster. Also, different serving units should be included. For example, one should be able to enter food as units of weight and volume, with both imperial and metric measurements. The amount of food consumed shouldn‚Äôt be required to be relative to service size. For example, I had 1/3 of a cup of oatmeal, but I was forced to say how many multiples of 1/4 cup that was. That‚Äôs a pain if you care about precision. Finally, the nutrition reports should also include vitamin and mineral reports. This could be particularly useful for vegetarians and others who need to be more vigilant about iron and other nutrients."
13,13,3,2019-01-28T18:28:50.000Z,Preview Works Better,"Fine App, Too Cumbersome to Find Food Points","The app is great. I learn a lot about the food I‚Äôm eating. The only peeve I have is that it‚Äôs too cumbersome to get to the Food Points section of an item. For example, when adding to the tracker,  you have to hit the search button, search for the food, click on ‚Äúexplanations,‚Äù lookup the points, then hit the add button. If you‚Äôre counting calories, you can go straight to the tracker and add food while seeing the calories per cup at the bottom of the item without all the extra steps. It would  be great if you could choose to see the food points quickly at the bottom of those entries as well."
14,14,5,2019-02-02T14:31:31.000Z,RetiredOnFire,Great way to set goals and stay on track,I use Fooducate when I need to get on track and start budgeting my food intake. I have a tendency to start eating more over time. When I find the scale is creeping up I use it as a food diary and it gets me back to eating properly. I did Weight Watchers years ago and found the ‚Äútracking ‚Äú useful to become more aware of what I‚Äôm eating and make changes. Fooducate is really handy for that. And it lets you input your weight and weight loss goals and then calculates your food intake you need to achieve that. It gives you a lot of flexibility to decide how long you‚Äôd like to take. It also grades your food choices. I was surprised to find that Samoa Girl Scout cookies have trans fats. Tasty but not worth it.
15,15,4,2019-02-12T03:31:14.000Z,TAArtz,Great app,"This app helps me realize what quality of food I eat. It keeps track of my exercise, water intake, and what I eat at every meal/snack with breakdown of calories.  It adjusts calories I can have based on my exercise.  It doesn‚Äôt display the other nutrition information, but it does transfer that information to the health app.  What frustrates me is when I am entering food for a certain meal, it changes the time to when it thinks that meal should be.  I wish it would leave the time as current and let me change it if necessary.  It has a database of thousands of foods and lets me add foods and recipes (until today).  I have had the app for about 6 months for free.  I don‚Äôt know if they changed something recently to limit capability."
16,16,5,2020-09-28T03:22:54.000Z,athena570,Best decision I‚Äôve ever made!!,I have been eating foods and wondering what‚Äôs inside them each day and have yet to find an app that does that and more. So when I stumbled open this I felt amazing! The app was well organized and as a played around with it I enjoyed the fact that I could scan foods in store to find out if they are healthy or not and why! This app taught me a lot about harmful things in Our everyday food and how to save money and be healthy! I especially like the tracker which is the first one I have ever gotten that works and preforms amazingly without having any charge. If you are looking to know what‚Äôs in your food and how to track and improve your health download fooducate (lol I sound like a ad) this app is awesome!!
17,17,2,2019-07-26T12:12:12.000Z,chrisminbrooklyn1980,Needs to take into account different goals besides weight loss,"Sigh. This app is...just not what I wanted. I need to gain weight, and while I love some of the metrics it provides if you want to gain weight there is nothing to help you in the app with this goal. Instead you have to more or less figure it out yourself. This app, unfortunately, is no help to those of us who want to gain weight, and as a result is part of a one-size fits all approach to diet and health, which is that losing weight equals health, which, as an eating disorder survivor, I can tell you is not true. It seems like it would be an easy fix to include other folks here to be more inclusive and I thought maybe I could get that if I purchased the premium features, but for now I‚Äôm just really disappointed that I bought the premium version, and hope that the developers will respond before my subscription is up. Ugh."
18,18,5,2020-09-10T13:18:35.000Z,Stvnjs,A very useful tool,"I have struggled for years to lose weight. Sometimes successfully, other times, not so much. I have found Fooducate to be a much more useful tool than others I have tried. The thing is, its on me to actually enter in the food I‚Äôve eaten and this app makes it very easy to do so. I also love how it figures out the calories I need to reach my goals. The grades for food are extremely helpful when at the supermarket trying to determine what I should or should not buy. Lastly, I like that it gives me alternatives to the ‚Äúbad‚Äù foods. That way I can make up my mind if I want an apple or a highly processed bar of some kind that might be labeled as healthy but in reality is not."
19,19,1,2021-03-06T18:59:27.000Z,badkitty_,"Like the website, hate the app","I downloaded this app because I like the website. But the app immediately began prompting me for personal information. Height, weight, age, etc. I did not fill in any of the information."
20,20,3,2017-09-08T00:57:04.000Z,Ferris Beuler,"Good, and getting better all the time.","(Adding to my original review- this is a great ap and better as more workable now less touches needed to use it.  I wish you didn't have to pay so much for the additional features but yes, they need to make money.  )This is a great application for identifying and comparing the healthiness of foods.  I dont go grocery shopping without it.  The new version is a pain because now it is trying to track my meals and be a diet app too; don't need that.  Also it is too many taps to go from scanning one item to the next.  It used to be easy to go from item to item in the store or the pantry scanning and learning.  Now I have to backtrack to get to the scanning screen.  The information is good however."
21,21,5,2017-10-06T20:54:56.000Z,Staygold415,An excellent calorie tracker and educational too!,"I love this app! It is far different from the other calories tracker app because it also educates you and grades certain foods. It informs you whether the food or drink you consume is healthy for you by grading it. For example if the food is healthy enough to eat the app grades it at A+ or close to that and if the food is unhealthy to eat, the app grades the food closer to a letter D. This really has educated me based on the grading scores of the foods. It truly helps me stay away from the bad and unhealthy foods out there. It‚Äôs also community based so the list of foods just keeps growing and growing. I totally recommend this to anyone trying to get fit/healthy."
22,22,5,2018-01-19T04:06:03.000Z,NegSilent,Not bad for free!,"I like the app. However, it seems very few of my food items are listed. It takes quite a while to enter all this in by hand. However, my diet doesn‚Äôt vary by that much -only by how much and what time of day I consume it."
23,23,2,2018-08-07T18:31:12.000Z,silentsophi,The Food Database is Lacking,"The largest hinderance to the use of the app is that the food database, even when scanning is a fraction of other apps like My Fitness Pal. For instance I tried to scan eggs from a National grocery chain and it want me to upload photos and details. I tried to log food bought from whole foods and it does not exist in the Fooducate app. It literally takes me 5 minutes to log a meal and maybe 10 to log a recipe in my fitness pal and it takes 15 to log a meal in fooducate and a solid half hour for a new recipe. I tried to add herb baked chicken and fresh sage wasn‚Äôt a pre-existing option and the chicken thighs I was looking for was not included but these processed frozen one were, that makes no sense. They really need to invest in their food database. Without it, it makes the app kind of worthless."
24,24,5,2018-10-14T22:06:52.000Z,saritkw,I use it daily,"Fooducate has changed my life. Literally. I did weight watchers, fitness pal, lose it, lifesum and others. They are nice but never worked for me because of the focus on calories only. This app opened my eyes to the source of calories - the actual ingredients that go into foods. I learned that a lot of the low fat and low carb food I had been eating for years were full of unhealthy ingredients. I swapped out these foods for healthier suggestions made by fooducate and things started to change! Today I‚Äôm 32 lbs lighter, and find it easy to maintain  my healthy eating habits without thinking of myself as being on a weight loss diet. Thank you!!"
25,25,5,2019-02-03T14:39:50.000Z,Wacj2r,Lost 7 lbs in one week,I know weight loss is not only reducing calories it also requires the right mindset to be successful. This app has helped be become more aware of what I‚Äôm eating and the amount of macros I am consuming on a daily basis.
26,26,4,2019-07-07T02:31:33.000Z,r!atm,Suggestion - Unliking,"This app works quite well for tracking one's nutritional intake. I really appreciate the ability to view better alternatives to certain foods. However, one slight annoyance I have is with the liking system. If you accidentally like an item, you can't ""unlike"" it, you can only dislike it, which does take it off your ""list"" but it brings the average of the product down. This is important for situations in which one hasn't tried the product but has given accidental feedback through tapping a heart. I would appreciate if an implement could be made in which a user can simply tap the heart again, and the like would go away. Otherwise, I have no qualms with this app and use it daily."
27,27,5,2019-09-09T21:06:23.000Z,AVIXDANA,I LOST 7 POUNDS IN ONE WEEK!!,"This app has helped a-lot, it forces me to be aware of everything i put in my mouth liquid or solid. The barcode part helps me a-lot when i want to log food quickly and efficiently and the community on this app has helped me a ton with weight loss questions and support. When you start the app it will give you a diet assessment of everything you have ate in 48 hours i believe and it tells you everything! Carbs, fats, proteins, exercise, sleep anything you can think of. Its the only fitness app i use a-lot. I used to be 180 pounds now I'm 178 and my goal is to lose 35 pounds. I recommend this app for anyone who is trying to lose weight."
28,28,4,2021-02-24T06:36:21.000Z,Travisplo,It‚Äôs Better but could be more,"It‚Äôs okay, as I said in the title. It *works*, but not perfectly or smoothly. For example, I‚Äôd enjoy a manual calorie burn input for external exercise trackers, instead of being forced to find something similar to what I did, and then trying to make a match with searching through the minutes and hours. Oh, and also being able to define a date as well as a time for exercises and meals would be nice.  Also, the ability to use the ‚Äúflexible measurement system‚Äù where you can manually type in any amount of grams for recipes. The ability to also remove old recipes might be nice. I might start editing old discarded recipes into new ones entirely otherwise."
29,29,5,2019-08-06T03:03:50.000Z,BOB$1000,Great app but change all grades from F to A,"I think this app is great. I take full advantage of their grading scale on food items. After going through multiple explanations on why they grade the way the do ,I‚Äôve concluded it is a very consistent and reliable scale but you have to look out what that products top grade is because it isn‚Äôt always an A, I wish they would just make the scale consistent across the board in regard to F-A. Otherwise it is pretty good for helping you track your weight but there are many other apps for that. The community is mostly pleasant and the app is very easy to use. 9/10 would recommend."
30,30,4,2018-03-07T19:57:09.000Z,NoahdaBom,"Great Tracker, Hard to Use","I really like my ability to add whatever I eat on the tracker to keep track of my calories and nutrients, but it‚Äôs a lot harder than it should be to add food.  Every time I select lunch, it sets me to 1:00 PM.  I eat lunch at 11:30 every day, so I‚Äôll often forget to change PM to AM then I have to go through everything later.  I‚Äôd prefer that the time didn‚Äôt change when I put a meal down.  Second, I can‚Äôt update my own recipes and I instead have to redo everything from scratch.  Third, the calories burned through activity are much higher than they should be.  Running for 30 minutes burns around 275 calories, not 500."
31,31,2,2018-11-17T21:57:19.000Z,tchmymind,I'll give it a little more time,"So far, I'm not very impressed. I understand that the in-app purchases are how the developers make money, but it seems like everything requires the upgrade. Maybe they should try offering a free 7-day trial or something along those lines. I'd be much more willing to spend the money on the upgrades (it appears that there are several different variations of upgrades, like different ones for low carb or lowering cholesterol or food allergies, etc. but I could be wrong about this) anyway, I'd be more willing to spend the money on the upgrades if I knew exactly what I would be getting. Maybe I'll try it for a month, but then, maybe I'll just look for another app that offers a free trial so I know what I'm buying."
32,32,5,2018-12-31T22:53:39.000Z,M_K_307,So much with free version!,"I just downloaded this app to help me as I train for my first half marathon and I want to make sure I‚Äôm giving my body the nutrients it needs. I also wanted to learn more about the food I eat in the process. WOW- not only is it easy to add foods to your diary, but it explains why they get their health grade/ratings AND offers up suggested alternatives! I only downloaded the free version to see how I like it, but with a little more time to see if it holds up, I‚Äôm definitely considering buying the full version (which would then help me with other health goals)!"
33,33,3,2019-02-16T18:18:35.000Z,superdanni,Does not work with Apple Watch and messed up total activity data,"This app is great but for the fact that it doesn‚Äôt work with Apple Watch. It does integrate with Apple health which results in duplicative data if you allow it and your watch to access apple health. So, if I walk for 60 minutes with my watch on, and then try to add a 60 minute walk to this app in order to show calories burned, all of a sudden my app health thinks I‚Äôve down TWO 60 minute walks, which eventually shows up on my watch. I tried to explain this via comments and feedback instead of a review but they just gave me the same speech about how it works with apple health. Going to switch to my fitness pal."
34,34,5,2021-02-26T06:03:20.000Z,AddictorXD,Convenient,"It‚Äôs a good and easy way to track calories and what you burned off. That‚Äôs what I usually use it for. I‚Äôm not a person who is a health nut or goes running everyday, I like food as much as the next person does. But I‚Äôm trying to lose weight, and it‚Äôs a helpful tool."
35,35,2,2019-09-30T08:12:37.000Z,Response Requested,Pro doesn‚Äôt have all features?!?!,"I tried to contact you through the app and it requires me to use an email all I do not use, hence sending a review in hopes of help. I bought the pro lifetime and cannot access the allergies section. I am very disappointed and would return the purchase for this. ‚ÄòPro,‚Äô to me, would indicate access to all features. There was no comparison offered so I could judge features and make an informed choice between levels of access. App is ok, but still needs a lot of work, I bought it for the allergy/gluten feature but I wanted the whole thing. Please let me know what can be done. Please provide your actual customer service email (not a link that only works with one email service) in the app in future updates as well."
36,36,4,2021-05-23T20:55:20.000Z,Paul Troon,Fantastic,I love this app. I have no experience with earlier versions. It is quite the handy device as long as the nutritional information is correct and as long as it is not ‚Äúcorrupted‚Äù by commercialism. I would hate to think that producers could rate their product higher. But there is no evidence of that so it is fantastic!!
37,37,1,2021-05-11T16:06:29.000Z,rayasummer,Pro version is useless,"I decided to do the subscription because the concept sounded great. It lets you customize your health conditions on your profile and shows you a breakdown of the nutrients of the food you have eaten that day, but that‚Äôs as good as the pro version gets. Although you can customize your health conditions it does not change the recipes that it shows you to cater to those health conditions which is pointless. All of the recipes they show are entered in by the community and they just show the most recent or most popular they do not let you even customize it yourself to show what kind of recipes you want to see based on your diet. It all honestly looks kind of random and you have to spend forever searching for what you are looking for. Any other health app would be better."
38,38,5,2021-01-03T03:24:23.000Z,Coll7784,Perfect App,"This is a great app. I‚Äôve used it for years and it‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs worked for me when I want to lose weight. There is a focus on nutrition rather than any specific diet plan. It‚Äôs very customizable, you can do points, or calories, set goals and monitor progress in detail. I really enjoy the daily breakdown and looking at the nutritional value of what I ate that day, rather than focusing solely on calories and weight loss. For me personally, that motivation to keep eating healthy because it keeps me thinking about what I‚Äôm putting in my body. I‚Äôve lost 30lbs in total."
39,39,5,2020-05-10T00:55:30.000Z,Ro7z,Now I Remember What I Did Not Like!,"I could not remember what I did not like about this app, but now I do! Sorry to say it‚Äôs after I purchased the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù. When entering a personal recipe, it will not let you enter the recipe amounts (example: the recipe calls for 1/3 Cup Sugar and it will only let you enter their SERVING amount for sugar - 1 teaspoon). You should be able to enter the recipe amount, then the calculation should break it down to serving size, based on the number of servings the recipe yields. What a bummer!!! I live alone and make my recipes so I can freeze portions and not have to cook every meal."
40,40,3,2017-09-04T02:12:04.000Z,RAP 1500,So far so good‚Ä¶,"So far this app seems to cover all the bases and it seems to integrate well with Apples health app. I've had the app for years but just started using it seriously this week since I was recently diagnosed with diabetes (yuck). I only have a few questions now: 1) does this app take in (record) daily supplements, and 2) how can I find and select foods in advance that will appear in the list when I am recording the foods I eat? Other than that I really like the detail and analysis of all the important food points like sugar, fat, cholesterol, carbs and many more. I'm sure after using it diligently for the next few months I will have a much better review."

Together, they have helped me lose weight and understand the best nutrition and maximum calories for my body type. Nothing else worked in the past, which left me frustrated. I thought that 1300 calories per day were a good goal in order to lose weight, slow and steady. I was surprised to discover that I only maintained weight at that number. I also like the fact that as I walk, Human tracks my progress and works with Fooducate to subtract the calories as I burn them. Great stuff!"
42,42,5,2018-05-01T15:18:49.000Z,megpenix,Has everything I need,"I‚Äôve been looking for an app that not only records my food intake but also helps me make better food choices. This app does it all. It helps educate you about what various studies say in regards to the amount of nutrients you need, it grades the foods you‚Äôre consuming and tells you why it receives the grade it does, and it gives you a list of better alternatives to consume."
43,43,5,2018-05-10T15:14:09.000Z,BLOO BERRI,Helped me lose almost 20 pound so far!!,"This great app is so easy to use!  I just love it! It helped me lose weight because it is so simple...after years of Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig and other incredibly expensive programs that never work in the end, this app is the BEST because you eat what u want and you learn to control your eating habits by yourself- in a way that works for you. Plus, even if you exercise only a little (such as walking slowly for 1/2 hour or 20 minutes) you can record the effect and it‚Äôs VERY encouraging üòé TRY IT and good luck!!"
44,44,1,2018-10-25T05:12:45.000Z,sbwilson0111,Better off reading the label,"I purchased this to help me navigate food allergens and to track my caloric intake. In my experience, the app doesn‚Äôt have a wide database of items so you‚Äôre left looking at the label anyways and inputting all the nutrition info manually into the app, or you have to rely on data another user has input (didn‚Äôt want to risk it with allergens). Great idea, I just wish they had more in their database. That may have made it a 3 star, but then I tried to cancel one of the paid premium parts of the app and I still can‚Äôt figure it out. It‚Äôs either a very non user friendly app unintentionally, or they‚Äôre making it extremely hard to cancel on purpose. For those two reasons, I have to give this the lowest rating."
45,45,4,2019-01-01T16:59:20.000Z,MGW1,Very functional app that serves its purpose,"This app has definitely been an eye opener for me with regards to food and drinks that were purportedly healthy for me.  Nice to get a quick snap shot and alternatives on the go.  My only suggestion to the developers is to move the comments sections off the main product page tab. When someone searches a food or drink product, most importantly, they want the product info, evaluation, alternatives and lastly, people‚Äôs opinion in the form of comments section.  Maybe just combine product info and evaluation and move comments to another tab with less priority. Thanks!"
46,46,5,2019-01-24T05:35:10.000Z,A real legends fan,Amazing support-full community!,"People here really seem to help each other to learn and live healthier lifestyles. Food is such an important factor to leading a healthy lifestyle and this community takes on the challenge of helping one another really well. I usually hate apps that try to shove their premium content down you‚Äôre throats but this app so far hasn‚Äôt done much of that, which I am super grateful for. I highly recommend checking this app over any of the other food apps because of all the reasons stated above."
47,47,3,2019-04-19T19:16:52.000Z,Ktktktkaza,Needs more preloaded restaurant meals,"This app has the potential to be something great. I love the scan feature for supermarket foods but when I‚Äôm entering meals I‚Äôve consumed at a restaurant it is almost impossible to find what I‚Äôm looking for. The search function needs to be improved greatly. For example I recently ate at the cheesecake factory but had to scroll through hundreds of entry items as I was not able to search for the particular meal that I had.  It also doesn‚Äôt list meals in any sort of order, they are just randomly listed. Perhaps when there is greater flexibility and search functionality I will consider purchasing an annual or lifetime subscription."
48,48,2,2021-04-27T14:40:28.000Z,Eleni333,Just Threw away 21$,"I just tried the app, only to discover that even for the price, I don‚Äôt get to track very many nutrients at all. Since I‚Äôm trying a vegan diet, nutrient tracking is more important than ever. I thought I‚Äôd be able to track more once I paid. They call it a trial period, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be free.  Am I wrong? Is it free? Either way, the eventual price isn‚Äôt worth not being able to track more nutrients. On a couple of other apps I‚Äôve tried you can track far more nutrients. The problem is just that their calorie accuracy is not reliable at all. However, I think I‚Äôm gonna go back to one of them because it‚Äôs so much easier to use than My Fitness Pal and you can track more nutrients."
49,49,3,2021-03-01T14:28:06.000Z,YamiG,Technical Issue,"I really like this app, I‚Äôve been using it for a few years. However, recently I‚Äôm no longer  able to add new foods when they aren‚Äôt in the database. Whenever I go to upload a food, a prompt tells me I not configured to send emails. I‚Äôve gone to the app‚Äôs settings and even my phone‚Äôs settings and can‚Äôt find anything to enable the configuration. I‚Äôve even updated my email in the app, hoping that by linking a new email it will refresh and auto configure. Nothing. I‚Äôm at a loss, and very frustrated because I can‚Äôt get any use of the app without this feature. Hoping developers can provide some guidance or fix it if it‚Äôs a bug."

51,51,5,2017-08-11T03:02:10.000Z,Nadwop,Awesome!,"I've been using Fooducate for years. It's always my go to. If I ever have a question about nutrition or ingredients...it always answers my question.  I suffer from intense migraines from time to time, identifying my triggers is very important to me. With Fooducate I can always make sure I'm good to go before hand.  I highly recommend and always tell people about it. Whether you're trying to lose weight or just curious about what you're eating, Fooducate is the absolute best nutrition app on the market. Thanks y'all! :)"
52,52,2,2017-08-23T01:46:31.000Z,Tomushky,No easy way to find your own foods,"This is a great app, but lacks of a few important things, nothing difficult to add, thus, it does not deserve more than 2 stars or worth to pay for the Pro version. For one, very difficult to find the list of foods you usually consume."
53,53,2,2017-12-30T04:26:38.000Z,GreedyLola,Was really enjoying until....,"I was really enjoying using the app until I tried synching data between the Apple Watch and Fooducate.   It seems that the communication between the two isn‚Äôt working (for example, even though I have read and write data turned on, it seems like the calories burned aren‚Äôt reading back to Fooducate from the watch.)"
54,54,5,2018-07-07T03:00:53.000Z,V0LT Tech,This app is great!,"I downloaded this app expecting it to be another cheap health app with ads every 30 seconds, but it's not at all! It's a great, simple way to keep track of what you eat, and the nutrients in it. I also really like that the app doesn't force you to buy the pro version to get anything worth it, and it doesn't ask you to upgrade all the time. I believe the features on both the free and paid version are fair. Overall, I highly recommend this app."
55,55,4,2019-01-24T02:42:19.000Z,Smok3dYou,First Impression,So this app prompted me for this review within the first 10 minutes of using it. As for a first impression it‚Äôs not bad. It gives you the option to make your own recipes and calculates the calories for you based on portion size and also allows you to scan the barcode of what you purchase.  Seems fairly easy to navigate and is also somewhat intuitive as far as the interface goes. I‚Äôm not yet convinced enough to upgrade. More to follow after I‚Äôve had some time to explore the app.
56,56,5,2019-04-29T23:00:17.000Z,DevonEileen93,Very helpful app!,"My boyfriend found this app and it‚Äôs incredible! I don‚Äôt use it for weight tracking (I use MyFitnessPal for that) but it‚Äôs mega helpful for scanning food. There were a couple things we thought were healthy that we introduced into our diets and found that they actually weren‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt just tell you it‚Äôs bad, it grades the food on a lettering scale similar to school and tells you WHY it‚Äôs bad along with offering healthy alternatives."
57,57,5,2019-06-21T20:21:08.000Z,BrownWest,Interesting Mix of Information,This app provides an interesting mix of information on food and nutrition.
58,58,5,2019-07-13T16:45:17.000Z,Punchie G,The Best,"I love this app because it really helps me think about the bigger picture: sleep, mood, nutrients, water, etc. And then it gives you information about the things you eat and alternatives that could be better. I don't even have a special diet or health issue I need to adjust to, but it has great features for those too. My only complaint is that they aren't updating it very often and it still has some interfaces that can be improved."

I have now gotten 2 notifications when I open the app that the login has failed and needed to have the confirmation info resent to my email address. Twice now I have done this and it still doesn‚Äôt work... that‚Äôs pretty disturbing considering that it had been working perfectly for the last week...  UPDATE!! I received an email from the developer and was given the info I needed so I‚Äôm changing my review to 4 stars! Thanks
61,61,5,2017-12-27T14:36:05.000Z,DionRichmond,Dare to be different,This app has educated me on food health and life as a whole. I use this app every time I shop. It helps me determine what‚Äôs healthy and what‚Äôs not. I have lost 52 pounds using this app. Food I thought was ok is really not when you educate your food with this app it tells you everything you need to know about what you‚Äôre putting in your body. I encouraged everyone to use this app and start eating healthier and live longer!!!
62,62,1,2017-12-28T18:53:08.000Z,Kaitqwertyui,All wrong!,"This app helps you read nutritional facts which the easiest way to read a label. It needs to break down ingredients into what‚Äôs good and what‚Äôs not. That‚Äôs where most of society has the biggest problem! Simply reading nutritional facts will not lead to a healthy life style. This is what Americans have been taught to do and this app is simply fostering the idea that that is how you know if a processed product is good or not. I have looked in the app extensively and it doesn‚Äôt recognize any harmful ingredients used by Food producers today. It seems to think if the product is low calorie and low sugar, it‚Äôs something you should stick with... WRONG. It kills me that this app is getting a good rating.."
63,63,4,2018-01-22T20:15:22.000Z,Vaya8,Great compliment to a healthy lifestyle,"I've been using this app for a couple years now. Helped me eat more consciously, while being aware of ingredients I'm sensitive to and was a great resource when I became pregnant so I could have more peace of mind with what I was eating. I would like to see more consistent units of measurement so I don't have to guess with oz, cups, tbsp etc., would like to see my historic data in longer ranges, and see more ingredient options when viewing historic data charts. These features I'm sure are in the works though:)"
64,64,5,2018-02-07T20:40:29.000Z,Milamoya,I love this app,"This app is outstanding, and I use it all the time. The rule for my house is something must have a B or better rating for me to buy. I will only break this rule if a lower rating is because of a little too much sugar or salt content, neither of which I have to monitor. . But when it comes to artificial ingredients, dyes, etc. I really appreciate how this app makes it easy to avoid these harmful substances and choose wisely. Great app and I would rate it higher if I could."
65,65,5,2018-07-18T15:02:51.000Z,Mbperry6,Love Fooducate!,"This app has really helped me on my food journey. I used to think I was a pretty healthy eater, but Fooducate helped me see all the detrimental additives in the foods I was eating. I scan products when I‚Äôm shopping and replace poorly rated ones with healthier alternatives offered by the app. Over time this has significantly improved my family‚Äôs diet. I recommend Fooducate to everyone who wants to eat better and avoid harmful additives in their food."

It tracks all kinds of exercises, the value of the food you eat so you‚Äôre eating healthy while watching your food, and even shows you the additives in food you weren‚Äôt aware were there. I even bought the subscription, which I never do, and I don‚Äôt regret it one bit. Love this app."
70,70,5,2017-12-07T15:04:18.000Z,Maddysaly,"So far, so good!",I used this app a few years ago and lost track with it after a few months.

I also lost 10 lbs.   You don't really know what you're putting into your body until you really look. This app makes it easy!"

The only downfall that I have noticed is there are foods that are not in the database, that I do eat a lot of times. I have submitted to have them added. I cannot be too critical about not having some of the foods because there is such a vast majority of food! So far love it!!!"
75,75,5,2020-05-09T21:03:03.000Z,amateurVegan,Life-changing,Definitely recommend getting this app! Its life-changing!! It shows you how much calories is in each item and the nutritional information. It even rates it from A to F on how healthy it is. It also has an option to manually input as well but definitely a game changer!

Speedometer for calories, pie charts for food grades, liquid/solid, etc) It is relatively easy to enter food, water, and exercise into the tracker. However, there are limited measurement for foods which could be improved with flexibility (for example: allowing food to be measured by weight OR volume). Another helpful improvement would be to add a tracker for servings of fruits and veggies. At the time of the review, the closest the app comes is tracking macros."
79,79,1,2020-09-19T19:14:00.000Z,ChzAnother,Terrible,This app is absolutely horrible. I don‚Äôt know why were paying 30 some dollars a year to do all the work. They don‚Äôt have foods entered into the system that are very popular. So for most foods you have to wait for it to show up in the system. The only foods that show up are the junk food that you‚Äôre trying not to eat anyway. Also the inner face really makes you not want to enter your food. To say it‚Äôs frustrating would be an understatement. It‚Äôs absolutely terrible. I will not be renewing at the end of the year. There‚Äôs got to be some app cobbled together by an elementary student for science fair that is better than this.

This is now the fourth time I‚Äôve been asked to rate this app, and I‚Äôve barely got my health information submitted. The only reason I‚Äôm giving it two stars is because I‚Äôm sick of being asked to rate it. It may be a five star app for all I know.

87,87,2,2019-11-24T15:01:58.000Z,TheGreatrygt,No true health option,Yes it breaks down what‚Äôs bad and good. But there isn‚Äôt even a way for them to tell you if a food or drink is vegan so you‚Äôre left in the dark. And not able to see what items you can and can‚Äôt trust it‚Äôs only for non vegans and non vegetarians. There is a vegan scan app but it doesn‚Äôt have near as many food options as this app has so if this app were to apply a vegan friendly logo to items and products that are then it would completely dominant the vegan scan tool! I hope you guys read this and decide to add it thank you!
88,88,5,2020-01-31T05:16:02.000Z,ShrinkingTyler,Just wow! Seriously impressed.,"Most impressive app on first impressions I‚Äôve ever used In a very very long time. The app does exactly what it‚Äôs name implies. Fooducate has educated me on my diet and the food around me in so many different, detailed, and easy to understand ways that it‚Äôs like I didn‚Äôt even know what ‚Äúnutrition‚Äù was before. Thank you fooducate! Improving health through education, for free? I‚Äôm a supporter."

There was a few items that it was unable to scan. Overall I think this app gives you the ability to know what type of food is healthiest for you!
91,91,4,2017-12-24T20:34:41.000Z,Feldinne,Good solid app to help track,This seams to be a good solid app to track food and drink but the in app purchases are a tad pricey and annoying for my taste. I don‚Äôt track calories I need to track carbs and guess what that‚Äôs an in ap purchase.  It works well for adding foods you buy but I‚Äôm still struggling to have it help with say a casserole I baked and I‚Äôm trying to figure the stats of.  But that makes guy be that I‚Äôm still new to the ap.
92,92,5,2018-02-20T15:38:33.000Z,Annine44,Incredibly comprehensive !,I‚Äôve use the weight watchers app before and this is even better my favorite feature is that they give you better options for the choices that you made and they tell you why so that you‚Äôre educating yourself as you go! Which amounts to Constant improvement In your nutrition choices!
93,93,2,2018-05-07T04:19:33.000Z,all my nicknames were takem,Can‚Äôt edit recipes. Deleting.,"App looks great at the beginning, easy to navigate and intuitive, good scan feature that allows you to get all the nutritional values from your ingredients and calculate the total calories for your recipe. I created a recipe scanning all ingredients and some weren‚Äôt in their data base, the app asked me to take photos and email them to add later and I did. I went to try and edit my recipe, add a photo and the remaining ingredients and the option of editing does not exist. This defeats the whole purpose of the app. Sadly deleting."
94,94,1,2018-10-08T13:19:35.000Z,Dha3249,Not helping me,I bought the premium of this app because I needed some features on the pro plan for my health.  After using it for almost 5 months I have stopped using it.  The reasons are:  1. Many of the foods that I eat are not on the app.  2. Many foods have the wrong nutritional information.  3.  They have no edit feature on recipes.  When I have contacted customer service I‚Äôm told they don‚Äôt know when or if these things will be corrected as they have so many users and can‚Äôt keep up.  That makes this app poor at best but worthless for my needs.

There‚Äôs also a number of things that are for premium members only. I suppose I like it better that way because that makes the app free for me, but it‚Äôs also frustrating because that impacts my full nutritional picture and as someone who isn‚Äôt gluten free by choice it adds an unnecessary extra layer of effort for me"

The food grading aspect is so helpful and you can choose different ways of eating, like diabetic or high cholesterol but the database is missing some really basic items from Safeway. I have tried adding them with pics, as the app suggests emailing them within the app. It will not send. I have even tried to do so by having to cut and paste into my own email. Too much work. Geez. I‚Äôm cancelling my paid subscription. I hope it gets better. I would gladly pay again"
100,100,5,2017-12-17T13:19:41.000Z,IrishLDS,40 lbs in 5 months,"This app has helped me lose 40 lbs (and counting). With a lot of discipline and hard work (waking up and running each day) combined with calorie counting made easy on this app, I have lost 40 lbs in 5 months. This is the first time I have felt in control of my weight loss and I contribute the success of watching my calorie intake to this app."
101,101,5,2018-02-19T04:36:36.000Z,Brad Crum,Great app!,"I use this app all the time. Wealth of information on all things eatable. It tracks points, calories and so much more. The food database has expanded to where I rarely scan a product that is not available. I‚Äôve even assisted in uploading a few through the years. Hope you find it as useful as I have."
102,102,4,2018-05-23T23:09:21.000Z,Muhloolee,Love the app,I love this app; the color coded grades for foods really help me to eat better; easy to use format. Nice breakdown of nutrients. I just wish that there was a whole week‚Äôs breakdown of average calories and exercise and nutrients n stuff.
103,103,5,2018-05-26T07:45:00.000Z,LynnGilbert,I love Love Fooducate,It is my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù app.  Before I even consider buying a product or food I check out Fooducate.  It‚Äôs keeping me healthy and stops me from even thinking of eating something that I shouldn‚Äôt because I know I can find an alternative that would be healthier for me.  Fooducate never disappoints with its clear rating system and providing alternatives.
104,104,1,2018-07-09T16:07:00.000Z,lula2347,Free the gluten free!,This is a wonderful app but if you‚Äôre allergic to anything (which is not and individual‚Äôs choice) you are required to purchase an extension. I was diagnosed celiac 10 years ago when gluten free was basically unheard of. It wasn‚Äôt until a few years ago I was able to order a pizza that wouldn‚Äôt kill me and I didn‚Äôt have to make. There is so much to share in the celiac world. It‚Äôs unfair to force someone to buy a ticket to get help eating and losing weight with a food allergy. This should be a free feature.   It‚Äôs a marketing game that I don‚Äôt wish to play.
105,105,1,2018-09-24T19:05:54.000Z,raychleo,Stop,"The whole reason I got this was for a feature (types of food sorting such as non GMO or keto, etc) and it turned out I have to buy premium for it, or otherwise just stick with the free version tell me things I can already deduce from turning a product over, and after every two actions, when I haven‚Äôt been using it for HALF AN HOUR."
106,106,4,2019-05-08T18:17:11.000Z,IasquaredI,Could be the greatest app out there,"I really do love this app.  It‚Äôs taught me how to be much more selective in the foods that I purchase, example I was just picking up the cheaper yogurt thinking it was healthy when it actually is not.  I love the grading system."
107,107,5,2021-05-26T03:31:34.000Z,gig1234077,I‚Äôm already loving this,"Well I‚Äôm new to this app first off second off I really think this app is gonna help me to 1 have better sleep. 2 improving my moods and finally to lose weight I wanna lose weight to be healthier and feel good about myself, I highly recommend others try out this app it‚Äôs absolutely amazing!."

You can add your custom meals, track how many hours I sleep, and even have many varieties of exercising for free!! I would recommend this app for people who want to lose weight."
109,109,5,2019-09-26T15:50:32.000Z,Texan Born and Raised,Great App!,"I love this app! It‚Äôs so easy to use, and I love being able to scan barcodes to track what I eat. You can also save recipes, and that‚Äôs great because I eat at home a lot. There is also a variety of choices when you track exercise, and that helps keep a more accurate account of calories burned."

Some items are not there but if you have a moment you can send a picture and the nutritional info to the app and they make the item for you! Love love love it! Thank you Fooducate!
111,111,5,2018-01-21T12:46:41.000Z,Object.Method,Bought lifetime subscription just to help support it,"I don‚Äôt use any of the advanced features that require a premium subscription.  However, I rely on the ability to easily grade foods so much for so many years now, I decided to buy the lifetime subscription just to help support and and show my appreciation. Thanks!"
112,112,5,2018-01-30T03:22:11.000Z,Jameswithadhd,Love it,"It‚Äôs a great app that I recommend everyone getting and using. I am already a healthy eater, but I‚Äôm a guy with a fast metabolism that is trying to gain a little bit of weight, so I use this app to make sure I‚Äôm eating enough calories for the day. I love the Newsletters and all of the other info I get from the app as well. Download and use now!"
113,113,5,2018-08-22T14:54:53.000Z,Sungfower,Great experience,"I have been using Fooducate for about four years. I have changed all around with the way that I see and eat food. Fooducate has helped me expand my view of what I used to think was good for me, and with results that I have gotten from my life change, I don‚Äôt use any other app. Thanks!"
114,114,5,2018-11-27T06:58:41.000Z,Btd is good 2 me :),Educational and practical app,"Scanning the bar codes on my food reassures me that I buy smart and healthy. The nutritional information is easily accessible, clearly labeling both the good and bad in each product. This app supports a productive lifestyle, and encourages me to stay on track with my personal goals. Would highly recommend!"
115,115,5,2019-04-18T11:56:48.000Z,ntaga,Helpful app but needs syncing capabilities,I love the nutritional information provided and the grading system that makes it easy to make good food choices. But I don‚Äôt want to manually enter my steps and exercise when I already have a watch that tracks these. Please provide Apple Watch (and other brand) support!
116,116,3,2019-05-07T00:02:51.000Z,kilpatjr,"Not bad, but dubious activity tracking","Calorie tracking is simple and has been very nice. I‚Äôve not been as impressed with activity tracking. It doesn‚Äôt add non-‚Äúexercise‚Äù calories recorded on Apple Watch, for example when walking around town. It also uses bogus calorie estimates from activities recorded by other apps. So if I record a 1000 calorie backcountry ski (climb up/ski down), this app might record it as a 600 calorie alpine (downhill only) ski. Too bad!"
117,117,5,2021-02-04T01:24:22.000Z,Zuluparrotthead,Simple but serious accountability,I‚Äôve been doing a ketogenic nutrition plan for (5) months. I stalled out and plateaued approximately 2 months ago.
118,118,5,2021-02-19T06:27:20.000Z,jane tribez,Use it daily,"This is a succinct app to track food, exercises, and daily food qualities. The recipe section allows the user to identify nutritional info and macros for personal recipes - which is helpful when recipes don‚Äôt provide that info. I have recently started to use this to track exercise progress."
119,119,5,2020-06-05T18:18:25.000Z,ABPinDFW,Been my favorite app for several years,"Literally has changed the way I shop and improved my health. We‚Äôve actually turned the word Fooducate into a verb, ‚ÄúI fooducate almost every before I decide to buy it.‚Äù Great tool for anyone trying to maintain the Mediterranean Diet ‚Äî or anyone trying to live a long, healthy life."

I can also see healthier food recommendations from other users. Fooducate has changed my life! I recommend you get Fooducate because you can loose weight, be healthy, and stay active!üëåüèªüëèüèª"
121,121,5,2017-12-18T04:29:15.000Z,Debbielead,Just use this app!,"All you need to do is spend the time and check out what you intend to buy. I am always amazed at how advertisers have warped my brain  The app will give better suggestions for foods and help total your daily intake. Easy to use, too.  Syncs with other health apps. This is a definite winner in my opinion."
122,122,5,2018-01-18T20:43:34.000Z,AshD816,Favorite Food Diary App,"I love that this app gives you explanations of why a food is healthy or not, in addition to tracking calories. The ability to add your own recipes and calculate the nutrition is a really great feature. Perfect for those who are interested in living healthier in addition to watching your weight!"
123,123,2,2018-02-10T02:44:04.000Z,Pam8393,Confusing,"On my first use of app, it seems other users have posted a lot about wrong information. And even some items state ""wrong or missing information"". And the photos appear to be uploaded by users, sometimes creating duplicates of same item. I'm not sure this is a site with valid data to guide nutritional eating and food choices. I certainly would never consider a paid version based on this initial experience."
124,124,2,2018-10-08T23:30:25.000Z,selinson,Good app with lots of information,I just checked out Fooducate entering a days worth of food and exercise. It does seem like a great app with a lot of really good information. However I find it cumbersome to use.
125,125,5,2018-10-30T01:37:11.000Z,Brybry920,I love this app!,"I love this app but I feel like a different format would be beneficial, I feel like there are so many hidden features that you have to dig through the app to find. But I love how you can track moods and sleep along with your food and water intake! And I‚Äôve found many healthy recipes"
126,126,4,2019-12-16T06:06:38.000Z,Goepeld,Need to fix search tool,"I love this app so much!! The only thing that is frustrating the search tool needs to be worked on, if i type in a food i want to look up it has to be so specific to retrieve any results. I always have to end up going to google typing in what i want and then ‚Äúfooducate‚Äù after it to find what i‚Äôm looking for."
127,127,4,2021-01-24T18:02:01.000Z,DiDi in Delray,Fairly Easy,"I have found that Fooducate is a fairly easy way to track calories. There are many foods that are not banked though, which makes figuring out calories that much harder. In addition, Fooducate should screen user-added foods and meals; there is a huge user-added bank that can be misleading. I have found a simple, electronic food scale very helpful."
128,128,5,2020-08-07T20:39:42.000Z,Nixie82711,Been using this app for years,"It‚Äôs been a major help to keep myself on track. Not only does it help me track my water, calories, exercise and everything else. I may not be the best at remembering to use it everyday (even though they nicely remind me) but I swear by this app"
129,129,5,2019-07-25T22:27:07.000Z,Igor_Y,This app is the best on the market,"I downloaded this app recently to track my eating habits and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. It‚Äôs easy to use, they suggest healthy alternatives to food you scan, and they even list recipes! Extremely happy with my decision and I‚Äôm considering even buying the one time bundle."
130,130,5,2017-10-02T16:03:04.000Z,Mrs. Goldfish,Have not found a better one,"I love the amount of items it tracks.  I also use it at the grocery store to see which item is better to buy.  And I have sent reports to my nutritionist which is so convenient, no more hand written food journals."
131,131,5,2018-01-17T09:36:01.000Z,Not a Diet...it's a Lifestyle!,Loving the App!,I‚Äôve been using this app for a month now. I‚Äôm very competitive with myself so this app is me against it! I work hard to keep myself in check and I have lost 12 lbs since starting! I recommend this app to anyone who is serious about improving their total health!
132,132,4,2018-01-19T17:52:17.000Z,Sammi521,"Great, but a few problems.","I love this app for tracking my food and water intake, as well as my calories burned. The scanner and grader for food is my favorite. However, I wish it was easier to send in new food. For some reason whenever it asks me to send in a product it won‚Äôt let me hit send on the email draft it makes."
133,133,5,2018-04-22T23:11:09.000Z,NatGancedo1989,Addicted!,I am not someone who counts calories but I definitely think very thoroughly about what I put in my body and this app has made the process so much easier!!!I am totally addicted to it and it has helped me made a lot of choices for things I eat regularly. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without it!
134,134,5,2018-10-20T18:20:28.000Z,HappyOrangeMama,Fooducate will certainly educate‚ÄºÔ∏è,Hands down this is the best diet app out there. As long as you are completely honest with the portions and source. Also helps you with alternative choices that are healthier. This app should be implemented in every doctors recommended weight loss and education towards food conversation.
135,135,3,2019-05-12T00:20:02.000Z,CeladonScream,Be advised: this is a fee based service!,"This may be the best app in the world for what it purports to do, and maybe I somehow missed some glaring disclaimer, but it really bothers me when I‚Äôm prompted for email and other identifying info (that becomes a mailing subscription I can‚Äôt delete) only to be prompted for a fee once the provider has our info. Fees should be disclosed before information is solicited; its deceptive marketing!"
136,136,5,2019-12-31T16:51:21.000Z,Isaku33,Perfect for calorie look up,"Great for looking up calorie intake and for looking up door for your pets so that you know what they are getting in their food. Also, if a website doesn‚Äôt have the amount of caffeine per pack on the site, this will have it in the description!"
137,137,5,2021-06-18T09:46:18.000Z,ToneDefManiac,A wealth of information.,I really appreciate the varied levels of information that can be derived from just the single input of one barcode. You present the facts and that‚Äôs what is always needed when our desire to improve our health is of tantamount importance. Bravo.
138,138,4,2019-11-15T17:47:16.000Z,Haliloniza2,Nice App,Very nice app however food that are under fast food and restaurant are not accurate and not updated. It is understandable that it will take time to update everything however certain things such as many Starbucks drinks don‚Äôt even include the amount of sugar under the nutrition facts. Still very nice app and easy to use.
139,139,5,2021-07-07T20:52:51.000Z,Nana DeMar,Best calorie tracker,And I‚Äôm an old-school calorie counter and this site here offers a ton of products the ability to add products and meals to keep track of every single meal I can plan a whole days food and stick to it I know exactly where I‚Äôm at calorie wise big thumbs up!
140,140,4,2017-08-07T18:42:46.000Z,miumar,"Awesome food, water, exercise and weight tracker",Just started today but seems pretty easy to find food and to enter food data that may not be in their food list. I like how it syncs to my iwatch and how it tells me every detail about what eating. Plus it has been pretty user friendly. So far so good. Hope it says that way.
141,141,5,2017-10-01T19:04:30.000Z,Keaton94544,Must have app for anyone who takes their health seriously.,This app is an excellent resource for learning about the nutritional content of your foods. I love that it gives alternative recommendations to healthier products. This is a must have app for anyone who takes their health seriously.
142,142,5,2018-01-03T20:44:53.000Z,SwimrRunr,Amazing app...wish it had one more feature,"This is an amazing app, I definitely suggest it.  There is one thing I wish they could add and that is a nutrition label added up for your entire day so it‚Äôs a nutrition label but instead of for one thing show the entire day"
143,143,5,2018-01-10T17:23:27.000Z,Princessgabgab,Best calorie counter/food tracker,I really love and appreciate this app. I have tried so many different food trackers and calorie counters to try to improve my eating and monitor my intake but previous trackers never gave me the information that I needed in a way that was motivating like this app does. It's amazing.
144,144,5,2018-02-05T22:05:59.000Z,TJGregory,Ms,Love the upgrade to Pro!  It fine tunes everything for my petite height.  I cannot have the same caloric intake as a taller person.  This Fooducate Pro app makes it easier because it has the additional information that I need.
145,145,2,2018-12-03T22:24:14.000Z,stocktj1217,"Fine, I guess I‚Äôll rate you",Just getting to know the app. Still don‚Äôt know what rating to give it because I‚Äôve literally just downloaded the app 6 minutes ago. The only reason I‚Äôm rating is to stop the pop up from appearing after everything I click on.
146,146,1,2019-03-24T15:23:42.000Z,Bashi's Granny,First day but will delete app,"I use and love CarbManager but was really interested in the food grades available here.  Disappointed at how many items I researched that weren‚Äôt graded.  Also, for example, I entered Premier Chocolate Protein Powder and had to hunt through the prepared drink (I said POWDER!), protein bars, etc. to find the product I specifically listed.  Need a ‚Äúhow to‚Äù section?  From the comments, it‚Äôs clear this app isn‚Äôt very intuitive.  And I can have 1,600k per day?  Dozens of other reputable sources cap me at 1,240 - that‚Äôs a huge difference!"
147,147,5,2019-04-04T15:39:23.000Z,winipooh50,Things I already know but need reminding!,This is a marvelous program with no meetings to run to and so much great nutritional information.  Love the comments and encouragement from others and plan to stick with the program until the weight is off and cholesterol is down!  Love it!!
148,148,4,2019-11-10T05:00:53.000Z,Sew.N.Crow,Wish it covered more emotions/physical pain,"I really like this app overall. However, if the intention is to cover mind & body, enlarge the emotional range. There is nothing for content, anger, fear, depressed, adrenalized, hyper, etc.  Also it doesn‚Äôt take into account physical pain level; chronic pain conditions such as Fibromyalgia, CFS, Mitochondrial disease, RA or mental health illnesses: depression, anxiety, OCD, BPD, PTSD or Bi-Polar Disorder. All of these can effect health & diet."
149,149,1,2021-04-20T14:06:37.000Z,Alrad2019,App is not free,"I was looking for a free App to help with weight loss goals, healthy food & exercise tracking. I wanted to try out this App to see if I would enjoy it or upgrade after trial. However the information I logged in to the program only shows a list with expected goal. It ask you to tap on the upgrade box which I have not done or intended to do at this time. I was expecting a free trial of what the App can do with a daily follow up of my progress before moving on to the upgrade."
150,150,5,2017-08-11T16:15:05.000Z,Aver Anne,Eye opener,This has been a wonder tool to find foods I thought were good for me but were not. I like that it gives alternatives. Only drawback is you will have the same product listed multiple times with different rating. Why?
151,151,5,2017-12-14T03:09:32.000Z,Shasizzl,I‚Äôm impressed,It‚Äôs very informational. It gave me descriptions of additives that even google didn‚Äôt give me. This app has a wide range of foods to check and includes great health tips and alternative recipes to foods. I will definitely be keeping this app and using it every time I grocery shop!
152,152,5,2018-01-16T00:44:51.000Z,cookiemama23,Excellent app,"I live this app to barcode scan foods. It gives you a grade, giving you instant information about the rating compared to other food in its category. You can dig deeper with just a click if you want more specific info. It‚Äôs great!"
153,153,1,2018-08-02T13:25:19.000Z,Jazzypuff,Inaccurate Scans,"While I think this app has a lot of potential, one thing we noticed that we think is very misleading is that the scans are not right. We have two exactly the same phones. Loaded the app on both. Paid the subscription on one and not the other. Scanned the same item with both phones and got two different scores. On the paid subscription, we got a D as a score. On the unpaid we got a C+. We‚Äôre not being picky, but something is not right here."
154,154,4,2018-09-25T02:39:23.000Z,KWD12,Overall great app,Helps show you what you put in your body.
155,155,5,2019-03-06T00:04:03.000Z,Clapier24,Amaze,Been using this for years it has almost anything you scan and if they don‚Äôt you simply take pictures of it and they get back to you! They have alternatives and explain its rating! So good I tell everyone about it.
156,156,1,2021-05-16T00:41:59.000Z,Family Disappointed,Family share doesn‚Äôt work,"Family share does not work with the paid subscription.  Your family can download the app but the paid lifetime subscription doesn‚Äôt transfer to your family members.  Such a bummer that we spent $93, the family organizer that purchased the lifetime subscription has access to all the Pro benefits but no one else.  Even when we try to restore purchases it wants me to purchase a new plan.  So sad about the misrepresentation."
157,157,4,2019-07-07T23:10:01.000Z,PajaritaLu,Modify entry,I would like to modify saved entries. Does the premium version cover Whole 30?  I guess it doesn‚Äôt need to as you don‚Äôt have to track what you eat.
158,158,1,2019-08-08T19:14:42.000Z,"cghtgtcgt,chyhy",Can‚Äôt edit or delete recipes,"I have written several times over two or three years about this issue. The only response I get is ‚Äòthis feature is not available at this time.‚Äô I don‚Äôt understand why users can‚Äôt edit or delete recipes they input, but as someone that wants to make adjustments, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to continue paying for this app. I also think that some of the searches and interfaces need to be streamlined and made more simple."
159,159,1,2020-01-20T16:12:46.000Z,CiaoGal,First time user,I see now why another reviewer didn‚Äôt like the constant request for a review. This is downright annoying.  So I‚Äôm giving you one star.  I‚Äôd give you zero stars if I could.  I‚Äôm having a difficult time figuring out how to use the app and all I‚Äôm trying to do right now is log my breakfast.  I‚Äôm resisting the urge to just delete the app and find another one.   I want to calculate my net carbs.  I‚Äôve started keto.  I thought this would be the perfect app.  Delete or not delete?  Hmmm?  Pondering!
160,160,5,2018-01-09T22:32:54.000Z,Titogap,Perfect nutrition app!,This my favorite nutrition app when go to grocery store and the best part is that it shows you a great variety of alternative or better options of foods! Recommended to anyone that wants to learn about what we bought at the supermarket!
161,161,5,2018-02-03T16:49:41.000Z,Satorie,Essential lifestyle app,Have been using this app for years!  Still current and I still love it!
162,162,2,2018-08-11T18:57:37.000Z,gottabereal101,food should not be graded!,"I understand that this app is great for weight loss. But there is simply no such thing as a ‚Äúbad‚Äù food! I have worked with people with eating disorders, and almost all of them said they used this app. I do understand that added sugars, and processed is not the greatest for our bodies. But everything is really not that bad if it‚Äôs eaten in moderation. In conclusion, as a dietitian, I do not appreciate an app that grades food, and idolizes which foods are grades."
163,163,5,2018-09-29T02:03:20.000Z,Nandi & Miya,Great app,I love this app it keeps track of everything and you can scan food items to see reviews and it can show you recipes and a lot more I recommend for you to download the app!
164,164,5,2019-06-27T15:17:24.000Z,Headache Free,A True Life Saver!,I have suffered debilitating migraines the past 40 years and one of the biggest reasons is the addition of monosodium glutamate (msg) in foods. The simple unknown addition of it to a food can send me in horrific pain to an emergency room. This app can be an invaluable tool to prevent that happening. Thank you!
165,165,1,2020-09-10T16:31:30.000Z,Bkst4,Frustrated,I started this app in hope to loose some weight and for me I need to do something everyday to keep me going. For me with this app it was posting. However The app decided to censor me and stop me from posting.  It said I disobeyed the terms and agreements but I did not! I look over the terms and agreements and I did nothing wrong. Now I can do anything on the app besides log my food or weight. I am so very frustrated about this. If the app could fix this I would greatly appreciate it.

Bad this is this does not tie in to a iwatch for exercise plus you have to upgrade to get stuff that should be included in free app. I would upgrade but they want way, way to much money for what they offer. I would pay $12 a year maybe?"

However, two things that would bring this to the next level are a widget and Apple Watch app. With a widget I could see my calorie budget without opening the app, would be much preferred."
169,169,1,2021-06-13T17:00:57.000Z,indraspective,No response from support!!!,"I wanted to track magnesium and omega 3‚Äôs among other micronutrients and as soon as I downloaded the app and found out that it only tracks a few micronutrients, and not the ones I specifically wanted I contacted support via the app requesting assistance (maybe it was user error) or a refund. I got no response. I‚Äôve scoured the app and it simply doesn‚Äôt track very many nutrients. I sent another message a week later and still have gotten no response."

171,171,5,2018-01-15T13:26:57.000Z,ccedwards0,So handy!!!,I love love love this app!  It makes a trip to the grocery store almost fun. Instead of agonizing over which of the literally hundreds of breads or other products to buy this app tells you clear and easy what the healthiest choice is.
172,172,3,2018-01-23T03:36:32.000Z,Dos H,Stop asking me to review!,The key to a successful app is ensuring the user experience is fantastic. And yet the designers of this app have seen it necessary to drag me out of the experience to solicit feedback twice in the first 10 minutes of use. Stop it please!  I can't experience the features of this app because I'm constantly being harangued to review the darn thing!
173,173,4,2018-01-24T00:03:05.000Z,Hockeymomthree,I wish you‚Äôd grade vitamins.  ‚òπÔ∏è,I wish they would grade supplements and vitamins.  My mom takes so many medications and I‚Äôd love to get her off of some.  Taking a good quality fish oil could be beneficial but I don‚Äôt know which one to recommend.  I come to this app for advice.  I really wish you could help with this too.  Thanks. Jenni

However, this is enough to make me stop using it: I don‚Äôt mind entering foods to ensure the information is correct, BUT if I make a mistake, I can‚Äôt go back in and edit My Foods. The app will let me re-enter the foods, but THEN there are duplicate foods in my list, AND I can‚Äôt even view the entry to tell them apart and know which one to use. This is a very HUGE nuisance, and it makes using the app not worth the time or trouble."
176,176,3,2019-04-05T19:23:23.000Z,Hejazsunkat,Could‚Äôve better,"Great nutrition info but the tracker is flawed.  Can‚Äôt track on the website, can only use a mobile device which makes adding foods not in their database tedious. Even on an iPad it acts like the phone app.  Food database also does not seem to be very comprehensive. Improvements in these areas would make it a truly great app."

I have made some conscious decisions to change to healthier alternatives to what I had usually been eating. I love the nutrition articles that educate us to make healthier choices.

I think the product is remarkable in that it allows for community and known new articles to help educate users about what is healthy.
184,184,4,2018-02-08T14:29:18.000Z,DaJoyK,Really great but needs GMI GMO,This is a fantastic app!!! But they really need to go back to having the scanner and food input on the FIRST screen. Really annoying to have to click click click click to get to the food scanner and input meals. Home-meals calculations could also use some streamlining.
185,185,3,2018-04-23T16:38:52.000Z,Scottywonka,Every click asks for a review,"App is eh, some things are wrong and when they are you have to do the long work of emailing them all the information for them to probably ignore it anyway."

190,190,5,2017-07-18T01:59:07.000Z,j2m13PF,Useful App,Easy to use. My only wish is the app would allow us to mark favorite foods. Another useful feature would be to choose multiple foods for a meal instead of one at a time.

I need to become healthier and with this app, it's so much easier because it tells me what the pros & cons to the food is and provides me with a grade of the food (A, B, C, D, or F).

I jumps the hoops only to find I couldn‚Äôt even put in today‚Äôs foods. The app clearly says it has a free option and a premium paid option.

The graphics are poor, finding a food to enter is so time consuming, this app has less than half of the options that pop up when you use My Fitness Pal. Maybe less than a quarter. Then, to add insult to injury, I have emailed support three times over seven days and have yet to get a single response. A total rip-off."

209,209,2,2019-08-03T13:07:58.000Z,GV Jay,Could be a first rate tool,This does a good job tracking lone ingredients. Try adding a new recipe!!!  It‚Äôs horrible. There should be a way to import recipes or ar least allow you to paste recipe ingredients. Even importing nutritional info would be an improvement. I have to use FitnessPal for easy recipe imports. They are busy improving their app so I may just cancel my subscription here for FirnessPal. Wake up Fooducate!!

213,213,5,2018-02-10T21:00:05.000Z,ml_lmnop,Interesting and helpful,Besides being easy to use I like that the app rates foods and explains why a food got a certain grade. Helps differentiate between good and empty calories and gets me to make better choices.

242,242,3,2017-12-05T17:26:43.000Z,gimedat,Ehh... it's alright,You can't search up a specific snack easily. They should have a search button. I like how they grade the snacks with one another which is cool but I would want a little more variety in choice. Overall I recommend is want to know what food brand is better.
243,243,4,2018-06-04T19:10:28.000Z,lezhonka,Great potential app,"This app has a great potential, the visual interface is very nice, all my food activities pop up whit pictures and colors. I really like it."

245,245,5,2019-03-17T23:06:14.000Z,ladyred53,I am trying to eat healthy,I love using this app because I have to watch my A1C. I had too much carbs and now I can check the food I buy. Where have you been . Thank

247,247,3,2021-07-25T21:14:47.000Z,Another app store user,Uses Imperial Units,Uses imperial units with no obvious way to switch to metric units. Put me off so I didn't even want to look at it further. // Clarification after developer response: Uses imperial units for my weight and height during setup of the app; I didn't even get past that to look at food items.
248,248,4,2020-11-04T05:47:08.000Z,okinawascubadiver,Decent app but fix the log in requirement!!!,Why must you log in so often? Just remember me! Face ID isn‚Äôt very helpful when you are wearing a mask in a grocery store. Now I have to touch my face to lower my mask to log in every friggin time.

251,251,3,2017-10-23T19:25:01.000Z,Luke hg11,Very Helpful app,"Fooducate has been very helpful with tracking my food intake as I try to lose weight. It is easy to use, and the simple, clean graphics are cheerful and keep me on track. It's definitely helped me recognize how much ""unconscious eating"" I was doing in the past."

258,258,4,2019-01-23T14:41:42.000Z,Megan NE,Pro does not include allergens,"Just as a heads up to others, pro level does not include allergen tracking. I was very surprised it didn‚Äôt. I think I‚Äôll still like the pro version, but disappointed that‚Äôs not a part of it."
259,259,2,2019-12-02T03:10:55.000Z,HeyeFade,Trash,I never really write reviews but it‚Äôs 2 stars for the layout and Idea. But the ratings don‚Äôt make much sense and are scattered across the board. If you really want to lose weight just burn off more than you intake and trade unhealthy snacks for veggie energy packed snacks. Period. Grazing/Snacking is what throws most of our diets off or just go Vegan and watch it all fall off ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

265,265,5,2019-02-09T12:42:20.000Z,S. Hall,Fooducate is the best free app on the market!,"Here are some of the pros: Scanner to track and learn about ingredients, dieting tips (articles), great community. For a small fee you can also customize the app for dietary restrictions or ailments."

268,268,3,2019-10-08T21:42:45.000Z,sunshine6069,Not what I need,My goal is not to lose weight which I feel is the main purpose for this app. It seems to only track calorie intake and macros and I‚Äôm looking for an app to make sure I‚Äôm getting all the proper vitamins and nutrients and see what I‚Äôm missing. Not for me unfortunately.
269,269,4,2021-01-12T16:06:59.000Z,Loveypuppeies,it‚Äôs alright,"it‚Äôs a good app but I‚Äôve noticed they block posting randomly but they normally fix it quick, but I think a cool feature would be to show how far you are in your calorie deficit."
270,270,5,2017-10-02T12:39:20.000Z,Sounds Like Music!,Keep It Between The Lines,This app really helps me keep my goals in site.  I've tried other apps but this is convenient and easy.

274,274,2,2018-08-01T13:21:11.000Z,TabWitch,Not everyone needs to loose weight,Some people have trouble keeping weight on and need to maintain a high amount of calories. Would have been a good app to track that if it would have allowed me to set a higher weight goal. Being healthy for some people isn‚Äôt just about losing weight.
275,275,5,2019-01-05T14:58:15.000Z,Nsmi,Very useful information,There is a great deal of information that helps me understand nutrition and food selection

284,284,2,2018-01-04T04:15:05.000Z,MsJorie,Inaccurate,"In just one day tracking food, there are a lot of inconsistencies. Calories per servings are incorrect, ratings are different for the same product. Multiple pictures of same product with different specs. I was excited but let down once again."
285,285,5,2018-06-02T23:20:22.000Z,Dryfly1,A,"Has a good system if you are looking to lose weight and shares recipes as a weight loss community, and facts about food that I never knew"
286,286,4,2018-12-05T04:06:09.000Z,Unofficial-L,Like it so far,Great & resourceful! Would be nice if I were able to adjust the goal to gain weight instead of only weight loss goals being an option. Also adding macros would be nice!

288,288,4,2021-05-31T13:22:14.000Z,Grannie Nan,Food search,Little challenging at times and sometimes slow not all foods in it but it‚Äôs helpful for learning about better choices
289,289,3,2020-12-31T16:09:43.000Z,lisamq73,Not what I was looking for,"Not what I was looking for.  I thought I‚Äôd give this a try to do something different. It tracks calories yes. Breaks down fat, carbs, and proteins in a very basic way. I‚Äôm looking for a tracker that will also count my micros so I know if I‚Äôm feeding my body the right nutrients."
290,290,5,2017-10-03T08:03:32.000Z,Dlavenders,Very informative!,The info provided about food is very helpful in keeping my daily diet healthy. Wish there were more info for dishes and meals.

293,293,3,2018-01-15T01:07:54.000Z,btrotter,Not the best,"I paid for the upgrade to the Pro version and regret it. I‚Äôm disappointed that you don‚Äôt have the opportunity to enter more data for custom foods....especially vitamins and minerals. Right now, I wish I would have stayed with my nutritionix app."

295,295,4,2018-01-30T15:50:16.000Z,Previously Fat Guy,Cool App,Very cool app. Love the database and information offered + suggested alternatives. Wish the app told you if a product was GMO but that may be a legal thing.
296,296,4,2018-04-06T20:58:49.000Z,Desireeannrn,"Easy to use , helpful","Enjoy using this app, like the food grading system, feel like the database still needs expanded for the available foods sometimes though"

300,300,4,2017-07-22T16:21:30.000Z,NR's iTunes,Love App!,I love this app-wish they added things a little faster when you send them new product information-it's a pain to do it yourself.

304,304,2,2018-10-08T17:23:57.000Z,Shmash‚òÄÔ∏è,Annoying pop up,Every time you click on something new it asks you to review the app. So frustrating as I prefer to use an app for an extended period before reviewing it. It also won‚Äôt let me list that I‚Äôm breastfeeding on the free version which really alters what calorie intake should be.
305,305,1,2018-12-14T19:26:20.000Z,TheJohn01,They stole my money.,"I have tried to get in contact with them. With no success. I tried and purchased the 3 dollar monthly subscription model they offer and was charged 40 plus dollars for the price of a yearly membership. My phone acted up when I was purchasing and I haves an iPhone Xs. So I thought that was very strange, but be careful they may take your money."

My experience has been that apps using this sales model are not worth the few dollars you spend.  I recommend you look elsewhere as there are fully functional apps of this type that are absolutely free.
313,313,4,2018-07-25T22:03:27.000Z,Jeff41015,App has issues,"Finding a lot of foods not scannable.  Tried submitting the necessary information but won‚Äôt transmit.  Need to fix the problem, otherwise it‚Äôs a pretty good app."

315,315,4,2018-09-26T12:16:58.000Z,Dhdjndinrnr,At least one feature missing,Need to be able to filter and sort in the food finder to find highly-rated foods.

318,318,3,2019-10-17T01:21:34.000Z,RedsCJ,Not as user friendly as it used to be,This is my second time using the app to track my diet. The updates have made it not as easy to use. I‚Äôm disappointed. Just getting my first meal in was a pain in the toush.
319,319,2,2020-07-18T23:08:25.000Z,Minecraftdude47,Wrong info,After just 2 days of using it I ran into 3 foods that showed incorrect calorie count or nutritional facts that were just plain wrong. First it says skim milk had 27 grams of sugar then a chipotle burrito that had 900 calories when the chipotle website even said it had 600. Great idea poor information.
320,320,2,2018-05-20T22:22:32.000Z,Madmaxracing,Not worth the money,Rarely finds the food I scan. Much better programs for much less that do better. What good is an app that you the one paying for the app has to input half the stuff you look up. Overall decent but not worth the money.
321,321,5,2018-09-23T05:50:56.000Z,annainak,Review,The app is vary useful and i love that it give healthy alternatives üòÑ i would suggest this app to any of my close friends and family for sure!
322,322,5,2018-10-14T04:06:37.000Z,coconow1,Instant Love,I just downloaded this app and the choice and quality of the articles is excellent. Thinking of upgrading to Pro.
323,323,1,2019-01-20T21:48:53.000Z,nrc1973,Don‚Äôt bother,"Had this for two days, still could not figure out how to pick which meal to log. Searched for a popular chain cheese pizza and it brought up every type of pizza offered ever EXCEPT for plain cheese. Too hard to search, very limited list to pick from, should not have to pick a category of food either."

326,326,5,2019-07-01T23:25:20.000Z,3GS 2010,Apple Watch Integration,I love this app! However an Apple Watch companion app along with integration with apples health kit would make the experience even better!
327,327,1,2019-10-04T17:29:04.000Z,odnoc,Requires login and can‚Äôt reset password,Totally blocked me from using the app (which I was using again after a long time). I don‚Äôt like apps that demand you login or create an account before trying it. What‚Äôs worse: I have an account but the app rejected all my attempts to reset my password and also rejects Apple-generated passwords.
328,328,1,2019-09-06T15:32:25.000Z,gdawg1971,Too Many wrong entries,"I recently re downloaded this because I thought I remembered it being very user friendly BUT none of the calorie counts were right on fresh foods. All the ones I tried to add had 1 or 0 calories. I even scrolled down quite a ways and never found an avocado that had 1 calorie. That would be nice, but it‚Äôs delusional."
329,329,2,2019-07-14T03:44:18.000Z,Lola910421,Errors,Love the app. Can‚Äôt stand that I can‚Äôt edit items in my meal I have to delete the item all together. The interface could be smoother. Errors in nutrition facts-is there an algorithm that can identify the photo and auto update it? I see a lot of potential in the app. I hope it improves.
330,330,5,2017-08-09T01:30:14.000Z,ChicagoMS,Helpful!,Helpful in making quick decisions on products. Educational too!  A must have.
331,331,5,2017-10-16T23:10:50.000Z,Wendy Taylor,Great up to the minute information,Fooducate stays current and seems to really do their homework. It's my go-to for ingredient and nutrition food facts.
332,332,3,2018-02-16T15:02:10.000Z,mamawkp,It‚Äôs ok,"A bit cumbersome to use. I had for two days and deleted, I like other apps better. To upgrade is too expensive. It does have some good information and parts but I just found it cumbersome"
333,333,1,2018-04-22T06:09:33.000Z,Lilu64,Crashed!,"Spent a half hour typing out a recipe with the directions and all. Then when I hit next after that it crashed. Went back in hoping it was there, but no!! I pay $7.99 per month for this? In other apps, it would‚Äôve saved what I had put in on the recipe so far? Super frustrated!!"
334,334,5,2018-07-31T04:24:36.000Z,MikealKorbinDavis,Mind blown ü§Ø,"This is a very impressive application. There is a very large database, and a great community to go along with it! The nutritional facts are extremely helpful. Thumbs up from me! üëçüèº"
335,335,1,2018-09-04T00:38:25.000Z,Macrolor,Confusing,This app is difficult and confusing. I have edited my profile multiple times and it keeps changing what I entered. The only foods that work well are if they have a barcode. So if you are making food from scratch it is cumbersome. Appears to be designed for those who eat all processed foods.
336,336,3,2018-10-29T17:59:40.000Z,Vivaciously_v,No  feature for us underweight folks,There isn‚Äôt any tracking feature for users trying to gain weight.... I was a little disappointed couldn‚Äôt set a target weight unless i planned to loose
337,337,5,2019-10-04T02:48:14.000Z,Larry lane lane,GREAT app!,It‚Äôs shocking to learn about food that you ‚Äòthought‚Äô was healthy!!!  Packaging and catch phrases are all false advertisement.  Take this to the store and you will learn so much!!!
338,338,4,2020-11-23T02:04:47.000Z,trippwelch,Vegan and Vegetarian?,I love this app so much! Love knowing what‚Äôs in my food. One thing I would really like to see added to this app would be like a little icon telling you if the food is vegan and/or vegetarian!
339,339,5,2020-10-29T02:31:04.000Z,Hgdhfgbf,This app is awesome!!!!!!,This is already Looking like it‚Äôs going to help and I haven‚Äôt even gone through a date yet

341,341,5,2018-01-24T16:09:03.000Z,Banewla,Love this!,Love this app! It keeps me in check. I use it whenever I‚Äôm at the store. I  try never to eat anything that doesn‚Äôt rate at ‚ÄúB‚Äù or above!
342,342,5,2018-01-25T07:18:39.000Z,Miss R11,EASY INTERFACE,I have been using this app off and on for about a year now and it‚Äôs very user friendly. Exactly what I needed!
343,343,5,2018-03-13T17:54:53.000Z,VangeB,FoodUcate,I liked the app haven‚Äôt used it for a long time. I think I quit when they started charging.
344,344,3,2018-04-05T18:01:22.000Z,Mj 830,Product Update?,Products should be updated as often as possible. HUGE factor! There should be a spot where it shows last time it was rated üëçüèº
345,345,5,2018-05-08T20:14:38.000Z,avabianchini,Fooducate,This is such a good app if your looking to loose weight you can scan your foods and it tells you if it‚Äôs good for you or not
346,346,2,2018-06-15T23:26:38.000Z,Kelcarluv,"Biased, incomplete, vague","The information provided beyond the label info is biased, incomplete, and doesn‚Äôt seem well informed. It‚Äôs like Weight Watchers style thinking - less calories must be better than actual nutritional value. Use it for browsing label info, but don‚Äôt rely on it for your ultimate choice."
347,347,5,2018-06-22T03:34:43.000Z,Inspiredgal,More than just a diet app,This app has all the bells & whistles and if you upgrade to premium for a minimal monthly fee the extras seem way worth it!!
348,348,4,2021-01-28T21:54:37.000Z,vthart,New,Seems as though everything relevant to helping you during the day requires an upgrade
349,349,4,2021-06-28T21:33:45.000Z,keepstrongkid,I don‚Äôt like choosing my gender as ‚Äúguy or gal‚Äù,"First, if you‚Äôre asking in order to get metabolic information, then you are asking my sex. Sex ‚â† gender. Second, please stick with male or female, and if you want to be inclusive, add intersex."
350,350,5,2017-10-22T16:00:56.000Z,Daynadaynn,Great App!,Has a very large selection of food products to choose from!
351,351,4,2017-12-06T04:34:47.000Z,-> ~jen~ <- <3,great but could be perfect,"love the app, good variety of food sometimes the rating i think could be fixed as far as things not being paleo brings the score of otherwise healthy food down. also it would be awesome in the daily summary section for the user to be able to see more detail of each macronutrient and how those percentages broke down"
352,352,5,2018-01-03T19:52:52.000Z,Mr. Pinner,Great way to understand how to eat healthy,Love this APP! It's helping me to eat better by helping me choose alternative foods. Very easy.
353,353,5,2018-01-19T14:40:23.000Z,Hanbanan86,Long time user...,I‚Äôve used this app for a long time (2013) and I love it. Easy to use and keeps me on track!
354,354,2,2018-11-11T23:45:34.000Z,LiddleKiddle,Not impressed,I‚Äôm testing this out. I‚Äôm not real impressed. The interface is kind of clunky. Deal breaker is the absence of a way to edit a meal/food entry. Delete it and put it in again? Not good. This is 2018. I also do not really need a list of comments on food items. Why?
355,355,5,2019-06-15T21:56:55.000Z,YoTelefono,Extremely helpful,I use this on products I buy. The alternatives help make healthier choices.
356,356,1,2021-06-03T15:15:02.000Z,Your Majesty 408,Bad update go back to old style,This newer updated version is less helpful.  They should put back the ingredients page where they listed it in a column & rated the safety of each individual ingredient & had side notes on the reason why it was rated good or bad with the potential harm & what to look for.
357,357,5,2019-12-21T13:21:56.000Z,Ms. Incredible*,Healthy living app,"I have to know how well I‚Äôm picking and choosing my foods, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs going into my body. It‚Äôs a very easy to use app."
358,358,1,2021-08-25T14:24:04.000Z,Ksb923,Limited foods for logging,I can‚Äôt figure out how to request a refund. I bought the lifetime package on Saturday and am highly disappointed by the lack of foods available for selection in the database. There is no way for me to request a refund and almost the most typical things I want to log don‚Äôt exist. Try fitness pal first.
359,359,3,2020-01-24T02:48:58.000Z,djean93,Food Allergies,The app itself seems to be good but I paid for premium services and then went to select food allergies and gluten and it asks you to pay again for that feature.  Not cool
360,360,5,2017-08-26T14:48:49.000Z,Stillman Songs,Very Helpful,Love how it helps me stay on track and monitor my calories otherwise I would eat wildlyüòç
361,361,4,2018-01-03T02:06:24.000Z,dgriff2,Too Confusing,Doesn‚Äôt have any real directions to use.  I can‚Äôt find what I ate in a day and if I do it‚Äôs not what I put in it and the meal times are wrong
362,362,4,2018-04-11T02:08:42.000Z,CarlaRDH,Exceptionally Helpful,This is a Fabulous App. Tremendously helpful when trying to eat a healthier diet. Takes the guesswork out of the ‚Äúhopes‚Äù that a particular food or snack is good for you or not.
363,363,2,2018-04-29T13:28:03.000Z,JoyStjohn,No program food and support email is down.,This app seems great but I‚Äôd think they‚Äôd include more diet foods or program foods as it‚Äôd be easy to find. I have to now add everything from my program. Ugh
364,364,5,2018-06-08T18:10:42.000Z,Tinatuna02,Fooducate,This is an amazing app!  It works well for me and has a wealth of information!   I highly recommend it!
365,365,2,2018-09-05T04:29:21.000Z,Urbannash,How much protein did I eat?,This app is just pretty unorganized looking to begin with. But then I added all my food intake for the day only to find it doesn‚Äôt break down anything besides calories unless you upgraded to premium. Going back to myfitnesspal.
366,366,1,2020-12-25T22:11:56.000Z,thefr8,Don‚Äôt use your real email address,"Have not had a chance to use the app much yet, BUT, the day after I signed up for it, I started get a lot of spam emails. So, regardless of whether the app is good or not, going to delete it as it is certain that they will be selling any of my data they capture. Thanks Fooducate!"
367,367,3,2020-11-03T12:57:58.000Z,mdenley,Ok but lacking in good analysis,"As a food recorder, it serves well."

378,378,1,2019-04-04T21:06:10.000Z,Razguul,Not accurate,"Food database is very inaccurate. After sending them corrections to various foods using in app tools, fixes were never implemented. Confusing interface. Also, cannot delete or change a recipe once it is created! Lot better choices out there."
379,379,2,2020-01-29T07:48:46.000Z,motherhensam,You can‚Äôt delete or edit recipes,This would be a great app if you could delete or edit your recipes. So many old recipes or ones I‚Äôve changed ingredients in are there with no way to get rid of them. Very annoying...

387,387,3,2021-06-01T21:25:15.000Z,camom80,"Pretty good, but missing GI...",Like this app and it‚Äôs recommended swaps but it would be super helpful to add a glycemic index rating too or add it into the explanation section. It‚Äôs a crucial component for so many on a specific diet! If that was here combined w/the scanner it would be perfect!
388,388,3,2020-03-31T05:52:35.000Z,AppMonkey54,Recent foods,I think it would make more sense if recently entered foods were listed as most recent.  I‚Äôd expect to see yesterday at the top and  3 weeks ago at the bottom.  Please fix.
389,389,1,2020-05-14T12:28:19.000Z,B:Rowe,Would rate zero due to poor service.,I signed up for a subscription through Apple and had to ask customer service a question but the website or app is not working to follow up with customer service. That‚Äôs awful customer service.

Not only does it outline your calories and macros, it also displays how much of your diet is being comprised of whole, unprocessed foods, grades each individual food choice, and explains every grade and what you need to look out for in your food. The app won‚Äôt just tell you ‚Äúthis product has xanthan gum in it, thumbs down,‚Äù it offers you an answer to ‚Äúwhat the heck is this weird gum and why is it here?‚Äù You might even disagree with some of the grades depending on your preferences and goals, but since all the foods have an explanation you can decide for yourself if you want to disregard that or not."

639,639,2,2020-09-22T16:40:32.000Z,The Runaway Robot,A good idea done badly,"The company seems badly understaffed. Nutrition scores and entries are highly uneven and not apparently made by well-qualified people familiar with current diet and food trends. Lots of items that have been on the grocery store shelf for years are unrecognized in this app but easily found in My Fitness Pal or FitBit. Then the developer wants you to do the work of photographing it and listing all the nutrition info and sending it in. Kind of like paying to have your car repaired at the mechanic‚Äôs shop then being asked by the mechanic to repair it yourself to ‚Äúhelp out‚Äù. Then one must still wait weeks, sometimes months before the info you send in is finally added to the listing. They notify you when they add the info you sent but in many cases it was so long ago I literally had forgotten I sent it. They recently did a (rare) update with major, unneeded, changes to the UI when what they should be doing is getting their listings up-to-date, consistent, and judged by a highly-qualified nutrition expert familiar with today‚Äôs eating and health trends. Then they encouraged feedback about the changes in the update listing *without giving an email address or any other way to give that feedback*. Thus this review. One of my feedback points would have been that they made the main rating score of each item much smaller and harder to read. How is that better? And the new UI requires more clicks to see the same info. How is that better? Why do app developers think ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù just means rearranging the same info but not improving the actual content? It‚Äôs a frustrating app to use in many ways with only glacially slow, haphazard changes that may or may not be improvements. It‚Äôs a really good idea done badly, sorry to say. For example, I like that they actually show a photo of the product. This is better than My Fitness or FitBit and can be a real time saver. But a lot of the photos are so small or dark as to be useless. The search function has long needed upgrading to be more intelligent. I would like to support it with a higher level of membership but I cannot in good conscience pay more for bad service or pay to be asked to do the work the app people should be doing. I would love to see someone take over this app and really execute the ideas well. It could be outstanding."

741,741,5,2012-11-24T23:10:52.000Z,BootlegBrawl,Awesome,"This app is perfect for watching what you eat, getting a breakdown of the nutritional content, or lack thereof, of most of the food you can find on any store shelf. This app has helped me broaden my diet by showing me healthy alternatives to a lot of the home-name brands you'll find in any store. This is one of the few apps you'll be using on a daily basis to manage your diet--and managing your diet is extremely important. This app gives alerts for and detailed explanations for things such as GMO's, artificial coloring, artificial flavored, etc... Do yourself a favor and try this app. It is customizable and is both developer and community supported. If there's a product you can't find by scanning, you can upload it to the database for everyone else. Oh yeah, and you can scan products in the store, or anytime using this app to get detailed information about the product. A must-have for anyone's phone! Also, I am rocking this app on an iPhone 4 with iOS 6. No issues creating an account or accessing anything in the app."
742,742,5,2012-11-25T17:22:49.000Z,YJeannine,Makes Eating Better Easy!,I've never bothered writing a review before (and I have a few really great apps); but this app is so wonderful that I feel I must contribute.
743,743,4,2014-10-03T15:40:24.000Z,Rosebud TX,Very good overall,"Mostly this is a really great app, not overly complicated (you can log in your info fairly quickly) and gives me lots of info I feel I can use. I also like that after I walk my dog for 30 min and log that in it tells me Great Workout! It's not really a great workout, but it makes me feel good , maybe it's the font they use ;)"
744,744,5,2015-01-05T16:10:42.000Z,ExplorerDave,Don't pay for the monthly or the one time 39$,"STICK WITH THE FREE VERSION!!! This app does have some good information about dieting and ways to help you eat better but nothing that you can't find online or through another source for free. They also have a very small list of foods in their information bank unless you eat a very simple and small variety of foods. For example I have a hard time finding restaurant foods in the app and I often times can't find the items I scan and it leaves me doing all the heavy lifting on getting the information in the app. I followed the instructions on taking a picture of the item and emailing it to the fooducate team only to get a response from them saying they want me to send more information from the product after I sent them everything they asked for. What more do they need other than the nutritional facts, ingredients and name of the product that I need to type out a report on a simple item? Talk about a scam, I spend more time with this app trying to figure out how I am gonna be able to enter what foods in eating rather than tracking my health through what I eat. Not to mention this app does not automatically keep track of my steps so I have to enter that manually as well. I paid the 39$ and I feel like just got robbed after using the app for a week. I expected a lot more for what I paid. STICK WITH THE FREE VERSION!!! Hopefully I can change my review in the future."
745,745,3,2015-10-15T23:16:38.000Z,Jmarlin,Good app could be better,I really like this app but I have a difficult time with things I make from scratch. I have to enter all of the ingredients each time I make something and I often have to substitute something from the list as I can't find what I actually used. It doesn't do to ask me to enter info as I don't normally have it. Also measurements of servings in grams is not at all useful. I might have rated it 4 or 5 stars if there were a few of my problems addressed. One thing might be to have a way to store a particular combination like my skim milk shakes or omelet.
746,746,4,2016-06-29T12:12:53.000Z,D. Hill,Fooducate,"Fooducate is one if the best mobile food guides a user can have. It can be used in a variety of ways such as research on the most nutritious foods, to lose weight and to track your daily diet. On researching foods users will see a view grade that tells them how nutritious the product actually is. This can be useful in discerning foods that claim to be healthy but are more likely to be following a deceptive marketing plan. One can also from researching nutritional value look at the ingredient label as well as alternative suggestions that fall under the same category. For tracking weight loss or daily intake users will have to use the premium version. While the app allows users to do a lot with the free version more specific individual goals require payment. The app also incorporates a social element with the ability to look up and follow users who have an account. You can see their postings and users can even respond to one another's queries. The design has yet to be updated to a high resolution but the calm orange like neutral tones and simple interface allow for a smooth welcoming browsing experience. This is one of the best health applications in the App Store and can be useful to people of all ages."
747,747,5,2017-04-04T02:16:18.000Z,Cgirl912,Wonderful tool that works,"Just recently put it to use since January 2017! Very happy with the outcome, it was exactly what I needed to lose 10-11 pounds to get to my ideal weight. I noticed i would go up about pound each week since I am in between moving and staying at hotels, eating out etc. I said nooo I have to do something.  Firstly, I love food and look forward to eating, I was doubtful because I've never been a calorie counter and wasn't working out regularly.  After actually logging in all my meals, snacks, any physical activity, even walking, taking stairs (anything and  everything counts) I got to see that I was actually eating too much of certain things although satisfied with less.  Once I was aware of that it was actually easy to stay under the limit and not feel deprived.  It was the easiest thing I've done towards actively losing weight. I became aware of what calories certain things have and how clean the food is.  It's all in the database, you can also scan the item and select the portion.  They just made it so easy, like a food diary but easier, little effort. Give it a try, it works! I would say I lost the 10 lbs over a 2 month period."

750,750,5,2011-04-11T23:08:54.000Z,Zac4,Wonderful app ~ Wish I could give it more than 5 stars!,This remarkable app is getting better and better. My whole family uses it and it has made grocery shopping into a game of finding healthy food for both the children and adults!
751,751,3,2011-05-16T21:09:52.000Z,NICU*Nurse,"Great concept, somewhat lacking","This is a great app in that it works very well and is useful in helping consumers better understand the food they're purchasing (to an extent). HOWEVER, there is no further explanations as to why each product was given the grade that it got. I consider myself to be pretty knowledgeable about nutrition, so I couldn't understand something like why the Tortilla Factory's 100% whole wheat tortillas I scanned got a B- grade when the same company's traditional (flour) tortillas got an A. Was it simply because the flour tortillas were slightly less calories? If so, I don't think someone should be led to believe that the flour tortillas are better nutrition than whole wheat."
752,752,5,2013-08-12T21:47:53.000Z,Sthrnfire1,Great for daily tracking!,"I absolutely love this app! You can keep track of everything on a daily basis. Track what you eat, drink, track your exercise, there's even a section to make notes about your progress, how you feel etc... I like the fact that you can look up foods, drinks and even supplements. There's a barcode scanner to find foods and if the scanned product isn't in the database you can add it! I've been having some health issues so this app has proved very valuable to me. I'm not using it to help lose weight but to keep track of what I eat, supplements I take and how I feel on a day to day basis. I use it like a food diary so I can look back to see if there's something I ate that made me feel bad. The bonus is it keeps track of my weight loss as well. If you're looking to lose weight or keeping track of what you eat for other health reasons, I can't recommend this app enough. Two Thumbs Up!!!"
753,753,3,2014-01-30T18:41:56.000Z,Calgal222333,A good start...BUT beware!,"This app is pretty good to get an initial look into your foods. However, DO NOT do what I see many times at the grocery store, which is: scan the product, see a C grade and put it back immediately. Don't do this, you can use the app but also use your judgement."
754,754,3,2014-06-02T19:16:06.000Z,ur2sec2late,Almost perfect,"I wish this app would have multiple serving options like MyNetDiary, which offers the ability to convert between different measurements (ex: tbsp to cups). MyNetDiary does the conversions for you. Unfortunately this app only offers changing quantities, so you have to find a table to convert everything (ex: converting a cup into a tablespoon), your basically stuck to the manufacturers default serving measurement. I also like how MyNetDiary allows you to set up recipes for things you often make, which makes for a quick look up. I also like how I can customize my calories, carbs, and fat intake on MyNetDiary. I bought this app because it offered food allergy warnings for gluten allergies, that was a big plus but unfortunately the ease of use was an issue. I really wanted to like this app and I'm hoping that they will make these changes so I can try it again because I really love the gluten warnings but until it's easier to enter different measurements, recipes, and adjust my cal, carb and fat based on my needs it just won't work well for me."
755,755,5,2015-02-05T06:03:57.000Z,AmberArriaga,Super informative app!,"I used to use myfitnesspal but kind of fell off the wagon and thus searched for a more interesting app for food logging. I came across this app and decided to give it a try and I'm glad that I did! It's an interesting app and with an update to expand the food bank I think this app is a hands down 5! I love that all foods in the food search come with pictures next to them as an icon, so you can easily spot the food you are looking for! It's really handy. Also, it gives you a GRADE on the food! Love this! And not only does it give a grade for the food it tells you WHY! dun dun dun! I love it. And the cherry on top is that it also has informative articles on food as well as it disects the pesky nutrition info label and explains to you what is really in your food. Absolutely love that. This way you know what you're eating, why it's good or not too good for you, healthier substitutions, and you learn the ingredients that you may want to omit or keep eating. Amazing!"
756,756,5,2015-06-24T17:08:37.000Z,irbdave25,Amazing app - so educational. I thought I was eating healthy until this app.,"I‚Äôm an avid runner and also enjoy many other cross training activities and have recently started to eat healthier since reading some books on running and what the top athletes eat. i‚Äôm amazed at what is often portrayed as being healthy actually contains so much sugar or is highly processed. Now I scan every food item before I buy it and many items I used to eat now don‚Äôt make the cut, from cereals, to health bars, juices, salad accessories etc. I‚Äôm not trying to lose much more weight as I often burn more than I can consume, but understanding what I put into my body and the negative effect food can have on your health and the increased risk of disease the information you get from this app is what the FDA should be mandating to have on every product. It‚Äôs only through easy access to information like this that we can start to solve many of the weight and health problems we have."

To my delight it also helps you track your calcium and other nutrients. The tips and reports they have have taught me a few things I was unaware of, and not to bost, but I am more knowledgable on health, nutrients and preventative medicine than most. The help this App gives, gives you the real time info that aides you to stay on track with your goals and needs. So you naturally being more informed make better choices. I can say it motivates you to make better choices and create healthy habits that fulfill the foodie in you as well as the inner athlete and healthy content spirit."

760,760,5,2011-08-24T16:38:28.000Z,Islegirl196,GREAT app!!!,"Love this app! But beware, if you want to put your head in the sand and don't want to be aware of all the crap we are eating that's making us sick, this might not be for you. No one can read all the labels and know what is truly in our food, good or bad. This app helps sort all that out quickly. My family is getting better food....No more D rated food in our house! Working on getting the ""C's"" out too. My only complaint is not with the app but with the grocery stores. Some of the alternative choices recommended can only be found in specialty and health food stores, few of which exists in our ""behind the times"" city. Hopefully this app will be seen by large chains and food companies and realize that we are tired of buying their junky food. If you like Eat This, Not That books, you will like this app! Best and most used app I have."

762,762,4,2013-08-12T09:22:50.000Z,Katrinalisa,One of my fab apps!,I use this app every time I go grocery shopping and have learned so much. I set up to help detect GMO foods and find alternative foods. It is great because it helps give me a choice on whether I want to eat poisonous food since the FDA refuses to make labels. Sometimes in this app  a GMO food may get a higher grade then it deserves because it is healthy in other categories. I wish that these foods would not get higher then a C rating so I don't waste my time opening it to see what is wrong. If a C or below I would just move on. I also wish they had more foods listed. I am stationed overseas in Germany and we shop at the American store but it is amazing how many obscure American brands they have that are not listed. Every now and then I will add a food for this app to analyze. I do believe more food gets added each day which makes this app get better each day. I would recommend this app to everyone interested in improving their health.
763,763,5,2013-10-14T13:27:51.000Z,DenverSnyder,"Great for healthy lifestyle, not ""diet""","After trying a few different apps for calorie/weight tracking, this is by far my favorite. Fooducate is more about educating users on whole foods, rather than helping yo-yo dieters lose quickly just to gain it all back. The app recommends a 1/2 lb weight loss per week, which is VERY healthy and sustainable!! Experts on HEALTHY weight loss will tell you not to lose more than 1 lb per week."
764,764,5,2014-03-15T10:27:12.000Z,Char's boys,Best weight loss tool ! Ever!!!!,"Finally something that can help me truly breakdown what I am eating throughout the day. I was on WW counting points diligently and exercising 4-5 x a week. My weight was coming off but ridiculously slow. It wasn't making sense. Plus I was crabby and always hungry !!! How could I be eating in my point range , exercising and not losing weight?!!! Grrrr! Enter Foodeducate. A coworker told us about it and I was intrigued. So started using it AND checking my points with  WW. Guess what? Sure I was eating enough points but what WW wasn't telling me was , I was eating way too much sodium, too many carbs, not enough protein. Since adjusting these things it is bloody amazing how different I feel. Energized, full, not craving my love, cookies. And guess what? Losing weight!!!! If you want to really to get healthy cause that is the key , not just counting calories or points but this app helps you get healthy!!!"

I have been struggling with my weight and wanted to track food ""points"" without the heavy expense of weight watchers. This app is the best for this! The design is so intuitive. I am able to scan bar codes and add items to my food tracker very easy (easier than I remember the WW app being). I also can track my weight, my calories consumed, my exercise activity & my body measurements all in the same app! I love the articles in the daily tips section and love the shopping list feature as well. This app even tracks my use of weekly ""bank"" points in the event that I go over my daily allotment of food points!!!! Words cannot describe how much Fooducate means to me. I was depressed and upset over my weight issue but this app has given me peace of mind. Thank you from the bottom of my heart and keep up the great work developers of Fooducate!"

I've been tracking everything I eat over the last week with this app. I don't add salt to anything yet I'm always over my allowance of sodium. What an eye opener.

769,769,4,2017-05-30T03:22:46.000Z,Larry G. R.,Real motivator,"I have been using the App for three weeks. In that time I have lost 7 pounds due to the changes I have made in my diet using Fooducate ,, the App really opened my eyes to what food is more healthy (less calories, fiber, less processed sugar, drinking more water, etc,,,).  Plus I found just the act of recording everything you eat makes a big difference, and helps limit my calorie intake.  So I got all that from using the App,,,  it also provided tips on diet improvement, something I really like --- more healthy alternative to what I was eating. So it did not just show me some foods were not as healthy as I had thought they were, but provides multiple alternatives.  I'm no dietician,, but as a regular guy looking for a little help on how to eat more healthy, I strongly recommend this App. I was not paid to provide a review, these are my own thoughts and ideas.  Adios"
770,770,5,2011-12-27T19:04:10.000Z,Wannabe Healthy,Excellent website,"I have to say that this may be the most used app I have. I have shared it with just about everyone I know and they too have given me rave reviews! Who knew that even some of the things I thought were ""healthy"" could have so many sneaky ingredients. I love that I can actually understand the information I'm given on the different products, makes it much more real time for my hectic life. I try to make the best choices everyday for my family and this app has made it a little easier to navigate the grocery store. I've even turned it into a game for my kids. If they want something that's not really healthy, I'll let them scan the item and see what grade it gets. If its under a C, they get to pick an item from the ""alternatives"" section instead. Thanks for such a great tool!"
771,771,4,2012-12-17T09:49:37.000Z,Catb127,Amazing and very helpful!,"When I got this app I was skeptical that it would really make an impact on what I purchased or ate but I was so wrong!! It not only has a wife selection of what it will find when you scan it but it has other options so if your in the grocery store you have the opportunity to make a healthier choice!! The only reason it don't get 5 stars is because it doesn't always find the products I scan, but it does offer you the option to manually add the product which is still a big bonus :) definitely would recommend this app to anyone who is looking to be a little bit healthier, I have personally found out some interesting and extremely unhealthy things about the normal products I would eat so I'm very happy with this app, I even got my boyfriend and two friends to get this! :)"
772,772,5,2013-06-10T14:16:31.000Z,Mitchysh,Amazing and motivating!,"This app is great! It encouraged me to begin being smarter about my food choices! I now became interested in actually looking at the nutrition facts To make choices on my food! It feels great to enter a good nutritional item on the health tracker, and entering a not so nutritious item just encourages you eat even better! It's very nice to see all the food you ate throughout the day laid out in one table! I rarely find an item not entered in the food catalog, so most of my food entries are already filled in! I also love the burn feature which allows you to enter the type of activity you did and calculate the amount of calories you burned subtracting that from your total daily calorie intake! I would highly recommend this app for anyone not only trying to lose weight but eating healthier!"
773,773,5,2014-06-06T14:10:43.000Z,Paint0350,Very helpful,"I have been concerned about buying good food and organic, non GMO for a while now and I keep finding that there are so many ingredients that *sound* healthy but aren't. This app is wonderful in the grocery store. Scan the item with the app to find out if any of the ingredients are iffy. Like ""natural flavors"" - I never realized that this is not a god thing and that the word natural is unregulated in the US."
774,774,5,2014-06-09T17:22:36.000Z,larrydoyle1,Best App to take to the Store,"This is a generally marvelous app.  It is unmatched for taking to the store, because you can scan products, identify their nutritional weaknesses, and use the ""alternatives"" feature to find more healthful versions.  The breakdown of reasons for the graded food products is invaluable, and the articles are well-written and worthwhile."
775,775,4,2014-06-26T20:50:18.000Z,DollyMizSti,ALMOST perfect,"I have been using this app for a couple months now, and it has really helped me see how much food I'm putting into my body in order to help me keep it under control. It's hard to see how many calories are in foods and how easily it adds up unless the information is right in your face, so this app definitely does that job well."
776,776,5,2014-07-24T01:19:19.000Z,BriJonez,Love love love this app!!!,"This app is extremely helpful and I'm so happy that I found it. There are others out there like it but I really like the grading system and even the ""fooducational"" posts. It is very user friendly and I have definitely helped my parents by introducing it to them for their high blood pressure. I have not purchased the pro version yet but I may do so after I start using it consistently (daily). It has really helped with grocery shopping too. I definitely recommend this to anyone that wishes to count calories on their own or count food points without a fad diet guru or a weight loss system. I would give more stars because 5 is inadequate of the tremendous help this will be to me. I had myfitnesspal and others but this is so far the best. The others bored me"
777,777,5,2014-08-12T21:31:46.000Z,agostigirl,ACTUALLY WORKS!!,"I am a fitness and nutrition enthusiast and I absolutely LOVE this app.  I am NOT a perfectly healthy eater and I have about 15 pounds to lose still but this app helps keep me on track.  It is so easy to use and readily accessible on your phone without draining your battery.  The scanning of bar codes is the BEST THING EVER!!  It automatically tracks for you ( all you do is put in how many servings you had) and raises your awareness of what/ how much you are eating.  I love the ways you can personalize the app to your specific health goals.  I also like the fact that you can see progress charted out for you.  I like being able to add foods in if they are not in the database.  Execellent design, fantastic ease-of-use and a truly EFFECTIVE motivator and health improver!!! I guess I really like this app, right?"
778,778,4,2015-01-13T07:53:18.000Z,Opmaki,"Helpful, easy to use, but still needs work","The great part about the app is how it can give you specific information about some of the ingredients in food products and the effects they can have on your diet and overall health. It even provides health grades to foods which is helpful. Two problems: 1. The suggested, calculated caloric intake can be very low and people may not realize this and just follow the suggested number without any info on their own calorie needs. 2. A lot of foods with no barcodes, like from fast food joints and restaurants, don't have grades or nutrition explanations and some barcode items appear without any nutrition info. Overall, the app is worth using, but providing more info on calorie needs & physical activity and having a larger, verified database of food would make this app even better."
779,779,5,2015-04-30T22:05:46.000Z,Sarah52980,A game changer,"This app really empowers people to take charge of their health and get informed. I've recently discovered the adverse effects of sugar thanks to the documentary ""Fed Up"" and the research from Dr. Robert Lustig, and I am so pleased to see that Fooducate agrees and tracks added sugars specifically! You can see not just how many calories you're taking in, but the quality of the calories you're putting in your body. I've been using this app to do the 10-Day No Sugar challenge and it's been so helpful in educating me about my food so I personally understanding the things I'm eating. My one complaint is I wish entering recipes was a bit easier with actual cooking measurements to choose. Cooking at home is essential to healthy eating so I hope one day to see this app make adding recipes a cinch! Love this app :)"
780,780,5,2012-01-31T02:37:03.000Z,Anna Howland,A must-have,"Even if you think you know a lot about nutrition, you need this app. I've taken it on one shopping trip and I've already learned so much. For example, that my favorite popcorn has sucralose in it and that fig newtons have trans fats-- even though the label doesn't tell you (!). If you buy a single thing from the middle aisles, using this app will change the way you shop and the way you eat. I used to spend a lot of time reading labels and scouring ingredients lists, calculating the pros and cons of one item before moving on to the next-- and probably still not making the best choices. With this app, my ""pocket dietician"" does all the work for me in a matter of seconds (and it's fun) and I feel confident that my family will be healthier as a result."
781,781,1,2012-05-25T11:01:36.000Z,SharonKN,DO NOT UPDATE THIS APP!,"I loved this app, but not anymore.  Now they require you to register to use it.  Sure, they say it's free, but it's a way to farm information from people that they can then sale to another source.  I value my privacy too much and I'm deleting it as soon as this is finished.  However, if you want to continue to use it, just don't update the app.  The old one will continue to work until they figure out a way to fix that.  I've done this on several apps.  They are still working.  Delete the app from your phone and don't update your computer.  Then reinstall the original version.  So far, It's worked every time."
782,782,4,2013-01-12T23:19:49.000Z,Myra0025,Easy to use,"I really like this app. It's my favorite food app this far. You are able to enter your weight, your goal weight and with that information it gives you your suggested calorie intake. My favorite feature is the ability to scan the food you ate instead of logging manually. It also gives a rating is the foods you consume and suggestions for other foods that may be better for you. My only complaint is that most of the suggested foods are not common ones you would find in your local grocery store. You have the option to send yourself text messages at each meal, daily, or weekly. I only wish we could customize them so I could send myself a message that says, ""put the fork DOWN"". Lol. Overall, I approve and it seems to be the easiest app for me to use on a daily basis."
783,783,2,2013-02-21T23:11:24.000Z,apozek,Great idea but the execution falls short,"Many of the calorie tracker apps focus only on calories consumed/burned without paying attention to the quality of the calories.  Seeing an app that tracks actual nutritional value without requiring me to type in everything was a nice surprise.  Unfortunately, the surprise was that none of the foods I scanned or searched for could be found...at least none of the good foods.  We try to be reasonably healthy in our food purchases, but none of the all natural, organic, etc. items seem to be in this apps database.  The over-processed junk that is so ubiquitous on store shelves comes up easily.  Seems to me that an app that is supposed to promote health would have a database that actually includes healthy food."

785,785,3,2013-06-16T14:08:27.000Z,Ladyflower1,Best Diet Tracker App I've found,"This app is as close to perfect as I've found. Many of the items I've scanned are in the database, so it's nice just being able to scan and select it, instead of searching the database for a general match. It's also nice that you can put little notes in with your daily menu tracker. This app is nice for tracking calories, but I'm really surprised it doesn't also display fat, since that is a huge part of your daily diet. I also really wish they would update with a password required to open the app. I emailed customer support and was told that I would just have to lock my phone. That's fine for a stranger but if my husband or kids are playing with my phone, they can look at all my personal info. I don't really want my 7 year old telling everyone my weight. If they add these two features it would be a 5 star app."
786,786,5,2014-09-07T14:11:33.000Z,Old44,Great for keeping track of daily caloric intake,"This app helps me to stay within and on target of my caloric intake in order to lose weight. By carefully following the recommended calorie requirement to lose 1.5 pounds per week I have been losing the weight. It helps me to see if a food item is healthy or not. I really like this app. I use the daily tracker firme 3 meals a day and a snack. It can even track the exercise I do by letting me input the calories I burned daily and it will compute that info into my daily caloric intake. If I don't exercise I know I need to eat unprocessed foods and small portions in order to get an A grade for the day and stay within my caloric intake to keep losing the weight, I choose to exercise and diet daily to get to a healthy weight and this app is helping me achieve that."
787,787,5,2015-01-05T02:35:57.000Z,butch5,Informative & useful app,"This app has been very good for me. Even if you don't always agree with the ratings it gives, it helps you narrow the search for healthy food. I love the scan function and use it every time I go grocery shopping. It also makes getting the correct nutritional value easier. I use it every day, every meal. 60 pounds down and counting."

789,789,5,2015-08-11T01:18:00.000Z,Art_trainer,A health nuts dream,"I've seriously learned so much from this app. It is SO educational. This sets it apart from other health trackers and food logging apps. It doesn't just focus on calories when determining when a food is good or bad or just okay for you- it will point out and explain controversial chemical ingredients, ridiculous sodium levels, ect. If you don't like reading into all of the nitty gritty things it says you can just focus on the clear grades it gives the foods you scan. You can use this app to find out what kind of cereal/ketchup/bread/anything is the best and worst for you from the grading system. Truly a great tool. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to learn what they are REALLY putting in their mouths or how to live with a healthier lifestyle."
790,790,5,2011-01-08T15:51:07.000Z,"Asheville, NC",So much fun!,"I also have an iPhone 4 and had no troubles with the app working fine.  I just took a tour of my frig and pantry with it, and it worked beautifully.  There were several items that were not in the database, but the app makes it super easy to instantly take photos of the product and email the company to update their database.  Several items received a B or a B- but it was not clear as to why (as in, all of the comments were positive about the product so why not a higher rating?).  The alternatives were usually helpful, but in some cases were foods that were relatively different than the original. It was a lot of fun though, and as someone who works in the field of nutrition, I think this app will be very useful."

I love that most foods I scan are in the database already. I love that I can immediately add ones that aren't! I think it's helpful that I entered mymy current weight and goal weight into y profile, and the app lets me know how many calories to eat each day to safely lose the lbs!"
792,792,3,2013-01-30T02:57:51.000Z,Kelseyturc,Beginner,"There are a few things that I don't like about this app. First, most of the alternative products that it offers are unavailable in my area or I don't know where to find them. It would be nice to be given options within the users location or provide info on where the product is located. The second thing is the serving size is sometimes difficult to decipher. For example let's say I browse the product whole wheat pasta, the serving size is considered the whole box that is just one example...I have had this with multiple items. I'm not eating the whole box of pasta, I am eating about a cup 1/2. Other than those to small glitches, I love this app and the more I use the more I learn how to properly use it. It really put everything into perspective on what your daily intake and exercise is. I enjoy the barcode option too."
793,793,5,2013-02-02T02:25:39.000Z,Reviewer444,Lots of work needed on this app,"It's great to track what u eat and the first few days it was fun, but soon the search process gets tedious as u accumulate more foods in your list. Users need to be able to delete foods u no longer want on ur list. Users need to be able to copy from one day to the next, i.e., if u have oatmeal 5 days a week, u should be able to copy that and not have to search thru a long list. I like the scan feature and it's helpful while shopping and to raise awareness about what we're eating. It will definitely  help me buy healthier food and stop buying some staples I keep in my kitchen. Yes, some good stuff, but needs more work. I contacted support once and they emailed me right back - kudos. Keep improving."
794,794,5,2013-02-16T03:11:46.000Z,brittlak,Super helpful and awesome!!!,"This app is perfect! 90% of the items I scan or search for they have in the database, even restaurant/fast food items!! I love that it tells you all the really important facts on the first page then you can click and see a lot more detailed info on the product. The ""alternatives"" button is great. If an item you scan has a bad grade, but you love it, click on alternatives and you get a huge list of items closely related. This is so helpful and I'm learning new things everyday. Being health conscious should be a top priority for everyone and this app makes it really easy. Totally worth the download in my opinion. If you really love being healthy and taking care of your body, this app will not disappoint!"
795,795,5,2013-02-20T14:24:57.000Z,BoredomBoy,Everyone should use this App!,"Very easy to use and informative. It validates the choices you are making or shows you the ""healthy"" choices are actually C or D. From sugar in your steamable veggies to 3x the daily salt in your veggie deli sandwich, but the app doesn't just stop there-when you discover the grade of the food you love isn't great-it suggest similar better grade receiving products. You can also explore products to see what is suggested in different food groups. Really impressed with how many products they have graded too. I have used paid food scanners and often they don't have the unique vegetarian, vegan, or small brand items-I have only found a few items on here that aren't listed and you can send a request to add it."
796,796,4,2013-06-30T19:01:05.000Z,mkatelr,Great app!,"Downloaded yesterday and started tracking food and exercise--love this app. Easy to use, nice interface. Set it up to go off when I get to the grocery store and it beeped on when I pulled into the parking lot. Shopping with the scanner was great for comparing foods I eat all of the time. The rating system (ABCDF) for food is awesome and I even made a couple switches after I found healthier offerings of things I eat every day. My issues are pretty minimal: the app doesn't seem to classify foods and drinks that aren't a name brand (e.g., fresh fruits and veg) and I haven't figured out how to manually enter calories for items that aren't rated (e.g., a meal replacement I eat for breakfast and wine--which I shouldn't have anyway!). All in all, I'm really liking the easy accountability and look forward to reaching my health goals with this app."
797,797,4,2013-12-20T17:26:41.000Z,Nigumo,A useful tool for improving a healthy lifestyle.,"I've been using this app for awhile now and I have to admit to it being handy. If anything, it helps me to be conscious of my dietary intake and also 2nd-guess everything I buy. Sure, my shopping time has now been extended by 45 minutes now that I'm scanning my prior grocery list; but that's a small price to pay for living healthier and taking care of my body. We are what we eat."

With most calorie counting apps, you can eat 3 donuts a day but as long as your under your calorie count, you're doing pretty well. But with Fooducate, it's different. They don't just give food a number, they give the food a nutritional grade from A to D. This helps you understand that yeah, this slice of cheesecake is only 100calories, but so is this plate of hummus and veggies! I would definitely recommend this to anyone."

All I do is scan the product to get nutritional insight, as well as , opinions of other users. Some of my favorite things about this app is the explanations for the grade that has been given to the foods and how it provides a product that is better Is better in Its category. Tracking overall food intake is great, but knowing exactly what I am putting my body is better! Yeah, It cool to read the labels and all, but the label don't explain what the chemicals are or how they could harm you. That's an advantage from this app.  Best app ever! I am considering upgrading, but the free version has served me well!"
800,800,4,2011-10-25T03:25:47.000Z,Ceciliaaaa,"Love it, but...","Thus far, Fooducate has worked well and really impacted my eating and shopping decisions. I have encountered two problems, however. The first is that the ratings don't seem to take sodium into account very often. This isn't necessarily a big problem if you're already reading nutrition labels, but I think it causes some salty foods to get a better grade than try deserve because they feature whole grains, etc. The other issue is duplicate items with different grades. I'm not sure how the app decides on grades and criteria, but I've encountered a couple of instances where say, the family pack of an item has a better grade than the standard size. It just needs some clean up.  Other than that, this is an extremely worthwhile app."

This app empowers shoppers by allowing the shopper to get a rundown of any hidden EVILS in their favorite foods. So far 4 people have downloaded this app on the spot after asking me why I was scanning my food selections. One conversation I had with a stranger was overheard by a district manager while he was 'stocking'. He hung onto every word while this male shopper and I were complaining about GMO's and how we appreciated the ""health food isle"".  This store plans on eliminating this isle and intermixing the products into the regular floor plan... A fact I am not happy about. So... This app came at the right time for me and I am thankful for this answer to prayer."

As far as pros, the ability to do a quick scan and get an immediate response in regard to the food you're considering while grocery shopping is unbelievably valuable. This app definitely helps me make better nutrition choices so I'm loathe to criticize but Fooducate definitely needs some improvement."

I especially love the built in shopping list so I don't have to switch in between apps. I make it a personal goal to only eat foods earning at least a B. There are some products that have lower/higher ratings than they deserve and those with too low of a rating are usually corrected but I feel like that is only to make people happy. Salads with 30% saturated fat, 31% sugars and high cholesterol should NOT receive an A-. I think it would be cool to see some pre-programmed menus/shopping lists in this app. Don't know if that will happen, though. Love this app regardless and highly suggest it."

I did weight watchers for 8 months and although their ap is good its expensive 18/a month. & W.W. uses a point system and doesn't focus on clean eating. Using W.W. ap I was confused about what the points represented and what was truly healthy what my net calories were for the day etc. their new plan is extremely confusing.  I found Fooducate and used it for a week & cancelled my weight watchers subscription. I have a better understanding of health, calories, what to avoid, where i am at on net calories and exercise with Fooducate I love it! I highly recommend this ap for people for nutrition and health info, for weight loss, and for tracking calories in and calories out. Thank you Fooducate!"

I'm a little cheap so I don't like having to pay to get the GMO alerts but $5 isn't too much for a useful app - also like that the full version can track for vet diets, something I haven't seen with similar type apps."
807,807,5,2014-12-10T00:01:05.000Z,Gerulatt,Great App,I love this app! I am eating mostly whole foods however not everything I eat is so the scanning ability it has is great! If you are new to eating healthier this will help you tremendously. They have a free version but I wanted to be able to get more information so I chose to pay for the app. I didn't even use the free app one day before deciding to go with the paid version. I'm not an expert but I do not want to eat food that has been genetically modified so I love the feature it has that tells me whether it is or isn't GMO. I like that it grades a product and then tells you why it got the grade. I would like foods to be verified quicker so that my final reading is accurate.

It teaches you quantity, Quality and exactly what you're putting in your body. It really brings to your attention how much you actually are eating when you are recording it. I was surprised how many few bites here and there and how much they added up. The quality of what I thought !, I was purchasing and what I was actually getting. To be able to estimate all my daily activities to know what I actually burned. The quality of  food knowledge and updates is invaluable and unlike any other app out there for A healthy lifestyle! The only improvement is to delete doubles n triples of same products."

You just scan the food you eat and most if not all of them are available, and the choices are growing everyday. It really opened my eyes through a lot of things. The app doesn't leave you alone to figure out how to keep healthy! It has newsletters, community sections, recipe ideas submitted by the app users, etc. It's so involved in what you do, you don't need safari to get through. I highly recommend this app before trying others. So thankful this exists. Other health tracking apps aren't this simple and fun. It's colorful and inviting, this is the only health tracking app I'll ever use. You'll love it"

I was surprised to see that even the products I bought in my local health food store were often not the best choices available. (Ex:  too much sugar; more salt than daily requirements, etc.) Another great feature of this app is that they not only give you info about what you are about to buy as quickly as you can photo the barcode, but with one more click you can see what the better options are- and those products might be right next to the product you were about to purchase!"

First, they removed GMO info and placed it in a separate app that was $4.99! That was short-lived. Now, that same price only gets you a three-month ""subscription."" Want info on GMOs and gluten? Oh, you get to buy TWO subscriptions! And it's nowhere near April Fool's Day."

I have not upgraded the app but am considering it to fine tune my intakes. One of the thing that sets this app apart from other calorie counting apps is the letter-grade rating of the foods you are eating. Therefore, while watching the number of calories you are eating, you are also looking at the quality of the calories being eaten.  There are a couple of things that can be improved, such as west coast food and ethnic food selections, but overall the app is fantastic and I have recommended it to many people."
813,813,5,2014-09-02T03:40:33.000Z,fwmaietta,Awesome and informative,"Great product. Many of the foods I eat are already in the database and those that aren't I can put in myself and enter in the nutritional facts. Makes it extremely easy to keep track of carbs, calories, and food points. Definitely would recommend to others (and I have). I have some food allergies so I purchased the pro version, the only thing I would like to see added would be that when grades are shown for a product, it would show me the grade based off of my personal information as well as the grade that would be given to somebody who didn't have any custom preferences."
814,814,5,2015-04-12T02:24:12.000Z,Jojothevego,exactly what I wanted,I told my boyfriend I wanted an app that calculated my nutrient and caloric intake by using a database that knows what nutrients are in specific brands and other more general things like an apple. I discovered this app shortly after telling him that and this app does exactly that. You can look up your favorite brands and it is so easy to add it in to what you ate today. You don't have to look at the panel and enter in every % this app does it for you. You can even look up menu items from your favorite restaurants and the app will tell you if it fits your diet and fitness goals. This app will really help me transition in to a vegan lifestyle and be healthy about it!
815,815,5,2015-05-07T23:01:56.000Z,Wake02,Love this app,"That the database is able to constantly expand due to user support is just amazing. Also having access to so much information, from recipes to individual nutritional values along with explanations and alternatives, allows one to really personalize any dietary goals and habits to their liking. What's more, this app allows for exercise input to calculate calorie burn alongside intake. Meals can be saved, recipes favorited, authors followed, goals changed, calorie quality rated, products scanned, entered, or searched, or submitted, and there is perpetual support from the community. If ever you were wanting to make healthier choices and change your food-centric lifestyle, this is an app you want."

Recently, I turned to this app as a way to get more in-depth info about how healthy the food I'm eating really is. Up front, this app provides great information on packaged food products and makes you feel great about making healthy choices. Unfortunately, this app doesn't provide much information on items that don't come with a barcode. Additionally, most of the alternative choices it provides you with are expensive organic editions or just plain difficult to find. For a college student with limited means, this app is not easy to follow."

It shocks me to realize what are Cs and Ds that I thought were better. It's only been a week and I won't say it's changed my bad habits completely, but the detail analysis it provides is very helpful/insightful. I want to subscribe to Pro, but I can't remember my Apple Restrictions password to purchase in App and there's not a Pro option to purchase directly from the App stores, so I can't (Can you fix that?). The only con I have is that the database of food is kind of limited (250k I believe), but you can always add your own recipes and they're quick about adding something that they can verify."

This is perfect and I have found it to be very well-designed and intuitive. My only qualm is that some product's grade ratings are off (I've only noticed this with two out of probably 40 items I've scanned so far) so just be wary of that and, when in doubt, go by the nutrition facts/ingredients instead."

Nothing like picking up Jif peanut butter like you always have because ""choosey mom's choose Jif"" rings in your ears every time you're shopping...only to do a search and alternative find and discover, *GASP* Skippy is way better for your kids...and if you want to go one step further, an all natural alternative is available. Try giving your kids a peanut butter that is made from nothing but peanuts rather than one packing some form of syrup or hydrogenated oil as the key ingredients. Now I do this with nearly everything I buy thanks to fooducate, and have dropped 10 pounds with little awareness I've even made a lifestyle change."

Love the fact that they show you the alternatives and why that certain food product is good for you. It tells you what ingredients are good for you and what to look or in the ingredients. If the food product is rated in the low range, it will explain why and what ingredients you need to watch out for. This is obviously a great app to use when you go grocery shopping because it lets you scan products to see if it is healthy or not before u even buy it and also change your diet and eat healthier. I highly recommend this app!"

I've taken to tracking my food with Fooducate because I find it easier than counting calories. Although Fooducate also tracks calories,you're always under your goal if you mainly eat foods that are good for you. I'm talking about eating A and B grade foods most of the time. This allows me to eat when I'm hungry without worrying about how many calories I have left because the healthy foods are naturally lower in calories. Fooducate helps me choose healthy alternatives for my favorites without feeling deprived"

I use Yummly to find recipes and makes my shopping lists and this app lets me find the healthiest choices to buy when I go shopping! It's simple, scan a barcode or search a product and it gives you a VERY detailed description of what's in the product, why it's good/bad, alternatives, warnings and/or reasons why it's healthy.

I love the grading system, the breakdown of how much real food vs processed food. Also the breakdown percentage of carbs, fat and Protein  It's so awesome that it even calculates how much natural sugars and added sugars are consumed. Big bonus that it links my workouts for my other apps and automatically adds them. My only suggestion to improve it for consumers is that calculating fiber not be a upgrade but a standard feature. It is so critical for good health and a big component in the fight against obesity and diabetes to make it a standard feature would be the right thing to do."

When the phone is trying to load the pie chart it will not allow the phone to do anything else, it does not register a missed call if someone tries to call while it's loading. The new measurements for the recipe or for the health tracker are great additions. I fear I may need to delete the app, since it has gotten difficult to use."

Many times we are misled by words in the packaging like ""all natural"" ""low fat"" etc. a simple scan of the product quickly details differently. Many apps are complicated with long explanations but once you scan a product it gives you a grade!! Now we all have been in school and know that an A is better than a C! I find myself at whole foods putting back food that I think it's healthy and when I scan it, it gives it a C-!! If you do get a bad grade on a product there is an alternative tab that gives you suggestions on what you should buy instead!! Great app!!!!"

The grading scale helps you make better choices.  I love the pie chart for percentage on carbs, fat and protein.  There are so many interesting things too this app that are not only helpful but it keeps you engaged.  I've recommended this app to others and I am evening thinking of purchasing the premium upgrade.  Take a bit to get use to where thing are but give it time.  It's a great app!!

829,829,1,2017-06-13T19:53:00.000Z,Meeeshmosh,Could be great with a few fixes,"At first I thought this app was fantastic. A great alternative to weight watchers with an even better explanation of each food's nutrition, and still a points system to count the value of your food instead of just the calories. This was great, EXCEPT it doesn't have food points for every item. In fact because it's based on user input, most unpackaged items that I put on my list didn't have an adequate amount of nutrition facts therefore the app couldn't calculate the point value. It's kind of useless to my diet if I can't count the points of every thing that I eat. I was using fitness pal but I don't want to count calories because it's not as productive as point values. Anyway, I'm deleting the app, but if they update the system and assign point values to everything, then I would totally use it religiously."

I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only can you see the facts and grades of the foods you consume, but also track your weight loss. This app has every thing you need in one place and is laid out in a easy and fluid manner. Unlike the other apps that let you list what you've eaten, this app tells you whether or not the calories were worthwhile. Everything I need in one place. This app was a refreshing replacement to the mundane layout of other nutrition and diet ones."

If fooducate had the following 3 features my decision would be simple because its food database has more of the foods i scan from costco and recipes and i like being able to take a photo of the food and use that in place of an icon.  what fooducate doesn't have is a way to separate breakfast, lunch, & dinner items that have been logged and it's interface is not nearly as pleasingly designed as Lose It! Hybrid vigor, that's what's needed.  Also I haven't figured out how to get a log of the total vitamins in the foods I've consumed, even though those numbers are in the nutritional information for the foods I ate."

Making what I bring home the first part of my healthy choices. I stayed on the suggested calories but then dropped another 200 (based on my trainers recommendation) eating healthier made it easier. Such a great tool.  Tried to get my husband to install app on his phone but didn't come with same bells. And whistles as the apple products. Easy to add products not available."

This is everything I could've asked for and more, and so easy! You can simply scan the barcode of an item and get so much info on it. My first test was with canned tuna: It showed me the nutrition facts, the A through F grade of how good this is for me, info on other similar products with better grades that I'll likely end up buying, and education on how tuna fish makes it's way from sea to can! How cool! So glad I happened upon this. Fooducate lives up to its name: Very educational. So helpful! Thanks!"

And this has been the easiest awareness-centric app I've found (coming from someone thats downloaded 10+). It scans labels, let's you pick portions, and almost always has the food I'm searching for. Suggested improvements would be to allow supplement tracking and or adding items when/if they are juiced or blended. I juice green veggies daily and the nutritional value isn't the same as eating them. So I have to compensate. Otherwise A+ app. Also- link with FitBit!"

Skip to about a month ago: I was in a human nutrition college class, but it was my first class of that nature, and I was very lost with the material. I decided to look up the app my sister was telling me about then. It's not only saved my grades in the class with it's easy-to-understand explanations, but now I'm using it constantly and taking nutrition to heart. Never thought I'd be a health fanatic like my sister, but I'm happy I've become one!"
836,836,5,2016-02-18T01:29:47.000Z,Livs77,Spectacular App,This app is pretty spectacular. It provides a high level of detail about all of the ingredients in a product and warnings about items to be concerned about. All of my eating habits are changed for the better because of this app. I would never have thought some of the products I was eating contained some of the bad things they did. Now I look everything up and check ingredients and once you've don't that a couple of times you really just know what is ok to eat and what to avoid in large quantities. I have lost over 80 pounds using the guidance from this app. Highly recommended.
837,837,1,2016-05-30T14:54:26.000Z,C0J7,System is off a few beats,"This app is definitely on to something great but the execution needs some work. Categories need their own rating system. You can't rate all sugars a c because they are sugars. I want an f through a rating for sugars where the best sugars in their category are an A and the worst are an F. I don't want all sugars to be a C because they are just sugars. You can't put 100% pure maple syrup at a c and then also put corn syrup at a c. Same goes for baby formula. No formula gets better then a c because ""breast milk is the best"". That may be true but breast milk is not a formula so the ratings shouldn't be compared to breast milk. They should be compared to the ingredient list vs other ingredients in other formulas. I've only used the app a little bit but I've already found several cases like this. I'm sure there are many more."

840,840,5,2011-02-01T14:55:20.000Z,cjmaloney,Awesome App!,This app is fast and provides excellent perspective.  Aim the scanner at the barcode and it automatically captures it and with a second you have the info.  We're trying to eat healthier and it may take me longer to shop for awhile but if I make better educated choices it's all going to pay off in better health.    It does not analyze supplements and local brands aren't built into the database.  It does ask for help though so if you take the time to provide information it will help everyone else.

842,842,5,2011-08-18T13:30:27.000Z,Krossculture,Overall best app in the health category,This app absolutely rocks!! The database of food is endless. The food grades and explanations are so helpful. I'm amazed at the difference in food quality even amongst products under the same brand. They make adding new products completely easy and convenient plus you get notified when your new product's grading is added to the database. I can't express how awesome this app is. My appreciation goes out to the creators of this app. They are truly consumer advocates and care about educating us on the food we eat and feed to our families. Get this app today- I promise you won't be sorry.

And if they don't have the food they make it really easy to take pics and email it to them so they can place it in the database. PLUS when I am shopping and I see something that seems to be a healthy alternative but I want to make sure I can scan the barcode and see if it really is a healthy alternative! I recommend this app to EVERYONE and especially anyone who wants to make healthier decisions!

What I would like to see improved is the ability to manage my likes and food lists, local products by region, the ability to calculate calories by weight and food type (like wine). I would like freedom from Internet and 4GS service by having the option to store my information on my device and not on some server. What I mean is I cannot use this app unless I'm always connected to wireless service. Which is not always available."
845,845,5,2014-01-16T16:46:37.000Z,cadencohen,An Absolute Favorite!,"I LOVE this app! I use it every day, multiple times a day for tracking my weight, carbs, etc. but my favorite thing about it is the information you get about food ingredients and suggested alternatives. It has taught me so much and is improving the way my family and I eat. I like that, if the food is not listed in the database, you can take three photos and they are e-mailed to the administrator so it can be added. I also wrote the administrator with a question/ suggestion and received a response (not automatically generated) later that day. Highly recommend!"
846,846,4,2015-10-03T00:10:15.000Z,PrincessLydia,Great App,"I love this app. I've been using it for about a week, and it's really nice. I like the way the food entry works, and I like the other measurements. I also really enjoy the daily health tip because. My big issue with the app is that it randomly freezes up a lot. It usually happens when I'm entering my exercise. I will have to close out the app and re-open it to finish entering  info. Also, it doesn't always save food I enter myself, which is really annoying. Like today I've entered a recipe three times, and the recipe still hasn't saved. It's very frustrating. If these bugs can be fixed, this will definitely be a 5-star app!"
847,847,4,2016-01-18T20:31:46.000Z,Ebbisme,It needs one change only,"I started using this app last night, and I really like it. I wish that Weight Watchers would incorporate notes, hunger levels, and times into its app, because these are the features I like about this app. I would give the app five stars if I could read comments on the same screen where I'm recording my foods, instead of having to go back to the different part. I also like the food grades and the notification which are the top products for nutrition. It makes me feel good to know that I am selecting not only low-calorie foods for weight loss, but also foods that are generally accepted as healthy choices."
848,848,4,2016-02-24T20:20:57.000Z,badkitty3168,"Good ""Weight-Watching"" Tool","This app is worth every bit of its nominal cost. Maybe you'll lose weight, maybe not, but what it does is make you very aware of what you're putting in your mouth. With this awareness of calories and nutrition, you will most likely eat more healthfully. Having this app on my iPhone is convenient because I add things as I eat them rather than trying to remember it all at the end of the day. The only thing I would add is the ability to enter your own smoothy recipe, for instance, with the total calories you've determined by adding up the calories on the packages. The way it is now, you have to enter all ingredients separately."
849,849,5,2016-04-07T16:47:25.000Z,mary1005,Excellent way to learn good nutrition,"This app is the best and easiest I have ever found to help me on a path to better health and weight loss. It is very easy to use, has excellent scanning ability to learn what foods to buy before purchasing and gives suggestions for better alternatives. It gives you a very comprehensive look at everything you consume and links with other exercise apps to incorporate that information onto you calorie count.  I love this app and highly recommend to everyone who wants to improve their health. Support is easily obtained and quick to respond to emails"
850,850,5,2011-03-04T23:09:20.000Z,"Little Star, Big Sky",Eye Opening,This is by far my favorite app!   I committed myself to eating healthier a couple of years ago.   I've been surprised... and even shocked on one or two occasions... that some of the food I thought was good for me is in fact worse than junk food.  Talk about an eye opening experience.
851,851,5,2011-05-21T16:11:13.000Z,divagasm,Great Product,"In the past I've seen products like this, but found that they were missing a lot of products from the database.  This app is great because if it doesn't have information on the food item you're researching the app will have you take 3 photos -- front of box, ingredients, and nutrional info -- and then send the information to them so they can add it.  Also, this product doesn't just grade the item you're researching, but it tells you why it deserves that grade and what healthier alternatives might be.  In my opinion this product covers all the bases."
852,852,5,2011-11-15T02:07:46.000Z,TWA0237,Very Good App,"I read about this app in a magazine and it was very positive. I downloaded it and have been scanning everything. It's very helpful and detailed and if the product you scan is not in the database, it will allow you to take 3 pictures, 1 of the product itself, 2 the nutrition label and 3, the ingredients."
853,853,5,2012-01-05T22:03:22.000Z,sstx,Wonderful app,"This is a great app that aids you in making healthy food choices for you and your family. It takes the guess work out of translating nutrition labels and it's like having a nutritionist go shopping with you. It's surprising to find out that products you thought were healthy because of labeling actually are not as good for you as they claim to be. I love the ""alternatives"" feature that allows you to make healthier choices if the product you normally buy doesn't get a good grade. Thank you for this valuable app that allows me to make more nutritional sound food choices!"
854,854,5,2013-09-17T16:29:00.000Z,Bmanda1,Fooducate,"This is the best app I've seen on tracking nutrition, and by far the easiest. As soon as you scan something it gives the product a grade (like A- or C), and explains why that prospect has that grade. I was surprised at how many things I thought were healthy actually weren't. Then it gave me some similar recommendations. This was really valuable, since I like to shop at trader joes and like certain products (like hummus or Greek yogurt). The app was able to tell me which yogurts and hummus were the best at trader joes, so I don't need to run all over town looking for a different brand!"
855,855,5,2014-02-19T21:00:06.000Z,Ozzie364,Actually pretty good app.,"Like this app since it provides the flexibility to lose weight by using points or calories.  I like the ease of scanning an item that is new and indicate number of servings.  I will guess that their database of items will grow. Only gripe I have is to many user entries for the same item.  There has to be a better way to filter through it. I include all the nutritional info and not just the quantity and calories for an item. Try looking for green pepper and you'll see what I mean. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, etc should  already have a standardized list in place."
856,856,5,2014-03-29T16:16:28.000Z,Kathrynelise.art,Awesome,"I've used many calorie trackers over the years and this one impressed me. u can track ur exercise vs food intake like some of the others but it does something even better. It doesn't track just calories, it can track everything else to customize to ur health needs. So at the end of every day it gives u a very user friendly assessment of the quality of the foods u ate (so not just quantity). It simplifies it and this very much appeals to me since I'm usually more interested in my carb intake than calorie. Anyways... This is great and I say it's worth the subscription."
857,857,5,2015-02-04T23:21:29.000Z,Healthy customer,Love this app! A must if you are health conscious!,"My family and I are making a strong effort to make healthier choices and this Fooducate has been essential. I scan everything! There are many instances in which I have switched to healhtier products based on recommendations from Fooducate. For example, when I first started using it, I was able to find a much healthier granola bar that is less expensive and available in my usual grocery store. It saves me the time I would have spend reading about individual ingredients and comparing labels. Fooducate does the work for me."
858,858,3,2015-10-05T15:14:49.000Z,bhjoma,A bit buggy,"I really like what the app is promising to do and I have no doubt that it does so but the current version does not allow me to select / input entries including my gender and exercises! I suspect that an update will take care of that, until then I can't justify upgrading to Pro yet. Update: Just updated the app, it works! Thanks. Update: I really love this app's interface, it's the best I've seen so far. However I am using a competitor's app alongside (for now) because it syncs with Fitbit (as does all of my other fitness apps). This setup is eliminating duplication & reducing entry errors and time, with the downside is defiantly the interface and ease of use. Please support Fitbit, I'd want to stick around."
859,859,5,2017-05-13T12:56:38.000Z,tarabyte.0101,Easy to use! Cool features!,"I love this app. It's intuitive and great features, even for the free version. My favorite is the recipes feature where you can add your own recipe and it calculates the amount of calories per serving. I just wish it had a feature to suggest the amount per serving and how many servings based on the total ingredients. I also like being able to create meals for the most common things I eat. Finally, I would like to suggest an ""edit"" feature for recipes and such for when we forget to add a photo or find a new thing to do with the recipe."
860,860,4,2011-07-19T05:07:31.000Z,christyness,Fives stars on next update if...,...you guys include two things:
861,861,3,2012-09-10T02:21:44.000Z,Abbs0399,Wonderful idea,"This is a very informative product that is well-designed and very user friendly. I do question some of the information provided though. For example, I have yet to find a product that will get higher than a B+. I even tried just scanning frozen broccoli and still got a B+. I'm not sure what can possibly be better than frozen veggies (arguably better even than the fresh form). I also tried scanning peas baby food which is only peas and water and those had a B- grade. I checked the alternatives and it gave me pur√©ed sweet potatoes and corn... Not sure who decided an overused grain (corn) and a starch would be better for my baby than a green veggie... Makes me question the source."
862,862,5,2014-07-30T17:46:54.000Z,Benther,Just downloaded,"I have spent the past hour and a half going through this app and in my opinion it is everything you could possibly need for dieting- whether you are counting calories, carbs, or fat grams. Or if you are just health conscious, this app has info on fast food, grocery food, organic food etc. It also has a place for you to start listing your meals according to the profile you set up to watch your weight. It even has a motivational message you can set to send yourself however many times a week you need it. Amazing!"
863,863,5,2015-05-06T11:50:25.000Z,Jonathan B McNair,It has everything and more!,"I've had the free version of this app for 2 days now, and I really like it.  I went through 3 or 4 other nutritional apps before finding this one; none of those come close.  I'm probably going to upgrade to the full version that tracks all major nutrients."
864,864,5,2015-10-25T16:55:14.000Z,Noah‚Äôs Wife,Great app for keeping you on track!,"This is a great app for helping you make healthy decisions about the food you eat.  It has helped me on a 100 pound weight loss journey. The tracking is helpful for keeping you on your path, and the food grades and daily information help you make informed decisions and keep you motivated.  Being able to scan a food's barcode as well as add your own foods/recipes is terrific.  The folks at Fooducate are also always very helpful, prompt and proactive when little glitches come up.  All in all a great app and great support."
865,865,5,2015-11-22T15:54:43.000Z,Relicrestore,Best App Ever!,"A friend told me about this app and I've used it everyday since I put it on my phone. I'm checking labels at the grocery store before I buy a product.  I check the content of the food I eat and have been amazed at the foods that I thought were good but I'm learning now that there are alternatives out there that are better for me.  I have now shared this app with my friends and they are loving it as much as I do.  I even added the profile and pet portions and am equally pleased with those as well.  Thank you ""Fooducate"" for this app. What a life changer!!!"
866,866,5,2016-08-30T16:34:50.000Z,2 fiddy a week,Amazing~,"This app is great. I find it super intuitive to use and easy to remember, and the way it breaks down and grades the nutritional value of the food is great. It's also really nice that the ""pro"" features, while they look interesting, aren't invasive and not having them doesn't detract at all from the value and experience of the app. Furthermore, the articles are well sourced and well written, and the recipe section is extremely well organized, and I've found some great stuff there. Overall, no complaints! I would recommend this to others"
867,867,5,2016-12-09T23:52:19.000Z,Alegria-assumpta,Easier than Weight Watchers,"I came from Weight Watchers because it was too much to keep up with. This app feels much more motivational, and is also free with the option of a more specialized paid version. I LOVE how foods are give ""grades""; I was pretty surprised because some foods WW said were bad are actually good on this app. I like the community interface a bit more than WW, but I think some people may not - its a big list from what I can tell. Also this app appears more gender balanced versus a large number of women on WW. Love this app and I already lost almost 2lbs in a week."
868,868,5,2017-01-04T00:31:47.000Z,CDesormeaux,Amazing!,"I absolutely love this app. I've used it for a couple of weeks and love every bit of it. I thought the only downside was some of the foods I eat aren't listed, but they make it ultra easy to get that fixed by an automatic email. All you do is take pictures(with their system)of the label, nutrition label and their ingredients. I love that everything is spelled out right easy for me with grades. The only downside is I've learned the hard truth about American food systems and how corrupt they are with what seems like it'll be healthy and it turns out it's awful for you! ‚òπÔ∏è"
869,869,5,2017-03-28T15:25:45.000Z,Lu.Kochaba,The best one out there,"I have been a health nut for years now and this app is hands-down the best one I've ever come across. I've had my plate, and my fitness pal, but this one really goes above and beyond. Very user-friendly, tells you facts about the food you would not be able to find out unless you truly looked into it, and also keeps track of the amount of processed food, and the nutrients break down beyond just macros. It's free to download but if you're willing to invest $30 for the entire year you can unlock so many amazing features."
870,870,5,2012-02-27T12:50:53.000Z,Chelseadmd,Review,"Absolutely wonderful app! Always been very health conscious and concerned w nutrition and the breakdown of cho, fat, protein in diet... This app has expanded my knowledge and created the building blocks for newfound product and ingredient knowledge in a simple logical manner. I'm making more educated consumer purchases and loving it thanks to fooducate.  Could NOT imagine going grocery shopping or living without it! I tell everyone about this app because i feel like Everyone should have this app and be more aware of what they are putting into their bodies. Keep updating and adding to this app...I'm forever hooked :)"
871,871,5,2012-08-08T20:09:38.000Z,Kelsieann,Amazing app,"This app is so awesome! I am a huge nut about eating healthy and it's not very easy in the world we live in! This app makes choices simple, you just scan, and see the review on the product, and if you don't like it's grade, it will give you better alternatives!!!! To me, diet is the reason so many Americans are in ill health, and for myself and my kids I will be using this app to lea is to better choices for a healthier future!! They grade the product, and in easy terms explain why the product is or isn't the best option! No more reasons to eat unhealthy people!!!!"
872,872,4,2013-01-29T13:00:27.000Z,Cheesy126,Very easy to use,"This app is very easy to use. Has a huge food database. Allows for GMO tracking and offers alternatives when you want to make better choices. I like the synapsis it gives you when you read about the foods. I wish it had more detailed food tracking (proteins, sodium, cholesterol etc) and would be nice if you could set your own specific goals to said details. But, over all this app is excellent and like I said, quick and easy food logging (if it takes too much time I usually will not track it all because I need something that can keep up with my lifestyle)"
873,873,5,2013-02-14T20:56:38.000Z,JedtheMarine,Incredible! Outstanding!,"This app helps me organize what I eat so much better than before! It helps me realize how terribly I was eating before. I love the interface and the ability to comment and like certain foods. My favorite part is the barcode scanner, this is so helpful! I'm sure this app will help me in my trek to weight loss, and an overall more healthy diet! I love being able to find healthy alternatives for potentially dangerous foods. Each food has warnings and background checks to help you know what's healthy and what's not. Outstanding work, this app. I love it!"
874,874,3,2014-09-03T03:22:46.000Z,BigKidEL,Missing basic food nutritional info,Warning - App is only for packaged & processed food shoppers.
875,875,5,2016-01-04T14:20:38.000Z,MellowBelle,You can learn more than just how many calories are in a particular food,I am not big on the calorie tracker apps and never have been for the simple reason that there is never a push for me to care about what I am putting in my body only how many calories I am consuming. I absolutely love this app because it is a one stop guide for the foods you encounter every day. You learn what to look for and what to avoid so this app is essential for a person who is looking to be healthy and not just lose a bit of weight.
876,876,4,2016-03-06T17:36:49.000Z,Amy4582,Pretty good,I like the idea of food grades and alternatives but some of them I don't understand even after reading the explanations. Today I was comparing two different granola bars and couldn't understand why one was better than the other as the explanations seemed to be the same.
877,877,4,2016-04-29T20:47:56.000Z,rootytootoot,Love this app!,I have lost 10pds already using this app! It makes it so easy to punch in what you eat & then breaks it down into nutrional pie charts for each day and week! It also loads my miband fitness info too. It did that without even setting it up! I would give it 5 stars but there are lots of duplicate entries of foods... That needs to be watched if the list gets out of control. Love the barcode scanner.. Used it to make grocery buying choices in the store. I also make lists from these entries as well. Love looking at the alternative healthier choices too! Sams club sells some really poor food choices üò≥
878,878,2,2017-02-06T00:18:06.000Z,CeeMeLater,"Food ""grades"" are great concept, but app falls short","I like this app only for the insights on food, the grades. I prefer something more interactive where I can put in the exact amount of food I ate, for instance 1.25 because that happens more often than not. I also do not like their stance on supplements. Fooducate will not analyze supplements because it believes you should only get your nutrients from food. Well of course! But Some of us have legitimate reasons for needing vitamins or supplements."
879,879,5,2017-03-19T16:00:09.000Z,N1ckthequick,Awesome,"Glad to see that previous issues have been fixed. Another thing I thought could help the app, would be to alert us when a product we've updated has been changed within the app."

881,881,5,2013-01-20T12:36:56.000Z,Dlakenorman,Love knowing about the GMO,"We are eating much better due to this app. We are able to see if it could have GMO in it and also track what we are eating.  Trying to keep our food with no GMO and low in sugar when I look in the health tracker. Great to be able to see how many calories  and how healthy I ate for the day.  Love that if you look up something you normally eat and it is not as healthily as you thought, it will give you other similar brands to replace that item with. Would love to see the data base have more generic food store brands."
882,882,5,2013-06-23T18:07:46.000Z,January Elf,Phenomenal App!!,"This app is the best app I've ever used! Found out you can program your health goals in there and be warned about GMO's in your food and even get wheat warnings, etc., if you have allergies!  The folks at Fooducate are responsive and kinda crazy smart!  And nice.  And they care about this stuff!!"
883,883,5,2014-03-21T21:22:58.000Z,Aceofspades2007,Good weight watching app,"A good overall app! What I like most about it is that you can add in your exercise and it will calculate it all for you. There are a ton of products to choose from and the ability to scan bar codes makes this app super easy to use. It also helps to keep track of things like sodium, fiber, etc for the day. At the end of the day it breaks down everything you've inputted and give you easy to understand stats. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to watch what they are eating."
884,884,5,2014-11-03T23:41:56.000Z,KassRN,One of the best apps on my phone!,"I typically don't review apps, but I felt compelled to share how awesome this app is. I love how it grades foods, and explains the reasons why. To make things better you can help add to the database if you scan an item that has yet to be graded! I have found the information to be accurate and very informative. My husband and I are very intuitive to food additives and whatnot that are very unhealthy but we still find ourselves scanning items while shopping to double check ourselves. Can't say enough how much we love this app!"

886,886,5,2015-01-30T12:31:21.000Z,Towwifey,Love it,"I've had this app for a while now and I absolutely love it. It's definitely helped me to learn what's healthy for me and what's not, and some things I thought were healthy were surprisingly not. With the help of this app in staying on course and I've been able to lose a decent amount of weight. The best part is the support you get from everyone in the community, they are all willing to help and give advice. I would definitely recommend this to people I know who want to lose weight or just be healthier."
887,887,4,2015-06-11T21:51:38.000Z,KidTriv,"Pretty good, probably will improve","I'm losing weight by exercising and counting calories, and this app is useful for calculating and tracking both. I wouldn't take all the info as gospel, especially when it comes to the calorie credit you get for exercising, as they can only be estimates of what you burn, but still pretty good. Database of foods and products incomplete. If you scan a product not in their database, the app makes you enter the information yourself if you want to add it, which I resent, though it's only 10 minutes. They will then grade the product. I am not a premium member."
888,888,5,2015-10-22T07:02:20.000Z,LOVE TO SNACK,FOOD IS MY LIFE,"I live to eat-but I also know that I need to watch out for whatever I put in my body. I have learned so much from fooducate! The new recipe addition is great. I have made five new recipes from this app. I love it, my kids love it and to my surprise my hubby loves it."

This app is so easy to use & it has truly been shocking to see how poorly I was eating before. Thank you Fooducate for opening my eyes & also providing the option for a community of like minded people that support each other & are just completely honest & real...I love it! Track your food intake, exercise & sleep to get on track with being a better you! For me...this isn't about losing weight, but getting healthy & exercising. Thanks again Fooducate‚ù§"

I have scanned pretty much everything in my fridge and I have to say I'm shocked and some of the results I have gotten.  But the app does have it's limitations.  There's a lot of foods that I have that really aren't in the database but I LOVE that three quick pictures and they know all about it.  It will take some time to be added to the database of course but they've made it easy to help the database just grow larger and larger!  Awesome app, keep up the good work!"

I'm trying to focus on eating healthier, again... This app did the work for me and saved me from having to burn up so much time comparing labels. It's no secret that eating healthier costs more but with Fooducate I can make choices by quickly comparing the facts and not be misled by advertisements. The top ""healthy food"" brands don't always have the healthiest content compared to other products I could buy. Now I can save $ without sacrificing the health benefit. Thank you Fooducate ÓÅñ"

When scanning the barcode, it's great to know what I'm eating, and if it's un healthy, I love having the alternatives with it. Yes, you must set up an account, but it only takes a few minutes. There aren't many ads, they don't spam you with emails or anything, and it's free! Please please please get this app. You won't regret it. It's also good to browse through foods to see what I should eat for snacks and meals. GET THIS APP! I love it! üòÉüòÜüòã"
893,893,5,2014-01-18T20:25:01.000Z,Loucnn,Top notch,This is a top notch program that in the very near future I will actual pay to use it forever. The only thing so far that the app lacks is a recipe builder. I am sure that will be coming in a upgrade in the future. Otherwise this is a super complete well functioning nutrition and tracking app in just about every respect. If you are a Weight Watcher then this is the app for you that will not cost you a penny unless you choose to spend it and as far as I can tell it would be money very well spent.

I use this app any time I'm looking at a new food product and actually trust the research they provide. They even look at restaurant foods and snacks from companies like Nature Box! Love this app, highly recommend it if you're interested in what's really healthy and what you're really consuming."

I have overhauled not only my bad eating habits, but keep junk and decievingly unhealthy products out of my family's meals as well...I never go to the grocery store or buy any item without consulting with Fooducate first :).  I have been tracking my foods and finally have lost my weight and have been able to keep it off (first time in my life)....love the new community and discussion features!!!  Love my fooducate :)"

When you reduce a portion, it reduces the amount of total carbs consumed in your review. However it doesn't reduce them in the section where you can tap meal ingredients. That means when I'm trying to see where I'm eating most of my carbs- a bell pepper, for example, if I eat a quarter of it, I'm still dividing by four to get the amount I've actually consumed. It would be so much easier for the actual consumed portion to be listed rather than overall good listing."

But I routinely found myself punching in the cals and not not really thinking about the nutrition behind the numbers. Fooducate brought to light all of the health benefits and health defects of everything I eat on a daily basis. It also gave me explanations as to WHY each product was good or bad for me, as well as alternatives for the not-so-great choices with better ratings. Love this app, I feel like the creators actually want you to succeed in reaching your health goals!"

I let my grandma play with it at the store and after about 30 minutes I started to think I would never get my phone back. This from a woman who says cell phones are 'the devil'. I can't believe this app is free either, I'd be willing to pay a monthly fee for it now that I know how amazing it is! Clear room on your main screen, because you won't be deleting this app anytime soon!"

I'm also finding that I'm scanning products I have at home and searching for healthier alternatives when I make my shopping list. That way I can be proactive and buy the better choices on my next trip without so much scanning in the store. It's saving me time!"

My kids and I love going through all the food in the house to see how they rate.  I can sometimes spend 2 hours in the grocery store now, zapping bar codes to pick the healthiest foods in each category. I am planning to join WW soon and just realized that the app even tells you how many points each product is as well.  It's a real eye-opener- foods that are marketed as being healthy choices often times are not! Its fabulous!!"

I learned: there's sugar in everything, vegetables are always good for you and if it has a barcode there's probably healthier choices.

I've been a label reader for years, but this app makes it so easy to identify the really bad stuff. I love that you can personalize it to certain dietary needs. Another feature that's amazing is the fact that you can discover each bad ingredient in depth. It's a bummer that not all foods are listed, but it's AWESOME for what most people buy. I would definitely suggest a comparison feature if the tech guys are reading this :)"

It's not survival of the fittest any more but survival of the smartest. You are what you eat and when our food is filled with so much toxins, drugs to make us more hungry to eat more and cancer causing agents (carcinogenic's) then it's no wonder America is filled with fat diabetics who are dying of cancer. This app isn't perfected yet but give them credit for what they've done, and the ARE working on it. Pass the word and use this app."

I even bought it after awhile because I wanted full use of all the features. This was soon after iPhone 5 came out, long before I heard talk of any iPhone health tracker much less THE tracker that has come out now with iOS 8. I ask you to please find a way to make this app compatible with the Health tracker. I paid money for an app that has been wonderful. I would like to see it reach its greater potential. Thank you for your time and consideration."

I'm glad that I can scan the codes of the products before buying them and see what's really inside and not what it says on the package. It's really helpful for counting calories and watching your carbs proteins and fats ratio.
908,908,4,2015-05-25T19:02:23.000Z,mglamb,"No, ""Avoid GMOs"" is a PREFERENCE","To the reviewer who dinged this app with one star and deleted it, LEARN TO READ.  Avoiding GMOs is clearly a preference setting, along with vegetarian, vegan, eating for healthy breastfeeding, etc.  It is to help users  evaluate and choose items to fit their needs.  Just because the developers accommodate users with a certain dietary preference that you happen not to believe in does not make the app scientifically invalid.  As a diabetic, I have found this app and its extensive nutritional database to be extremely valuable in helping me control my blood glucose, lose weight (75 pounds so far), and eat healthier."

I went through my fridge and pantry out of curiosity and I can honestly tell you I threw over 90% out.. It was interesting to see the small print content of all the so called healthy foods out here. I had what I thought were whole grains and healthy food in my pantry I was surprised to find out the truth. Thank you so much for giving me the tools to uncover what is really going into my body..

It warns you about excess sugars and heavily processed foods, etc. The food scanner is excellent- far better than most at catching even a shaky hand picture of the barcode."

I have been surprised by some of the poor nutritional ""grades"" earned by the so-called ""healthy foods"" I am used to buying.  What an eye-opener!  Be cautious, though.  Some products are not rated accurately and some of the data is wrong.  Some products were listed in the app as having high-fructose corn syrup - but when I read the packaging of the product in the store, it was not an actual ingredient.  This app still makes a fairly reliable guide, and I refer to it often."

One thing that I would recommend as an addition to the app is if they would tell HOW MANY servings are in a package. The points are listed for dieters, but it's not very helpful if you don't know the serving size. With that being said, I use this daily and love reading what makes or breaks a product for their food grade. :) I feel much more ""fooducated"" about what I'm putting in my body and this app definitely helps me make better food choices. Thanks!!"
915,915,4,2013-09-18T19:28:41.000Z,JessieWanKenobi,Good Little App,"I'm enjoying this app so far. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star is because there aren't many restaurant foods available. Also, you have to sift through so many user added foods. It's hard to tell which ones are actually correct. It would be nice if the database of foods was put on by the Fooducate folks only, and users could submit their own foods to see on only their device. I love the fact that foods get a grade (A, B, C, etc.) Clean it up a bit and get rid of so many user added foods, make more restaurant foods available, and it would be 5 stars."
916,916,4,2013-12-28T13:33:54.000Z,SN4677,LOVE this app,I love this app and it's probably in my top three most frequently used. It's become an integral part of my journey to eat healthier as a family. I try not to eat anything rated below a B and usually stay at B+ or above. It's easy to use and I'm always pulling it out during my trips to the grocery store if I'm unsure about an item. My only complaint is that you can't scan a second item after you've already scanned one without going back to the home screen which is a little annoying. Fix that one thing and this is a five star app easy.
917,917,5,2014-07-05T14:20:05.000Z,Amers922,Best for low-carb!,I searched high and low for the best app to track a low-carb diet. This has by far been the easiest and most user friendly! You can switch it to track by carbs instead of calories and it has a status bar at the top so your number of carbs for the day goes up as you add food. You know when you're getting closer to your limit with each item of food you put in. I have had success in weight loss doing a low-carb diet and I owe it all to this app for my success!!
918,918,5,2016-07-10T17:18:17.000Z,Em30939,Healthy Way to Track Food,As a health science student I can back this and it's various rewards to users. Eating healthy is easy when all you have to do is scan and see a break down of food; also helps on my cheat meals cause I can find ways to eat a fun meal like a burger or pizza and balance it with something healthy without going over my calorie limit!
919,919,1,2017-04-26T03:05:34.000Z,pannster,Hate the notifications,"I use Fooducate to educate myself on healthy food choices and it worked great for this purpose. For some reason the app creators have recently decided it would be a good idea to send the notification ""Please log your meals. Even a few is fine."" incessantly. I am considering deleting the app because of this. Not only is this notification pointless and intrusive, it is passive aggressive and condescending - two things I never thought I would say about a phone notification! As a physician I do not have the time or inclination to log my meals because someone else thinks it is good for me. Please allow me to use the app in the way I feel it is most useful to my lifestyle. And don't treat your customers like children."
920,920,5,2011-11-27T17:01:07.000Z,Wendyb3287,My most favorite app!!,I love this app!!! Its very easy to use.  I have spent hours in my kitchen and the grocery store scanning items and looking for healthier alternatives. It's even helped me save money. I have scanned new more expensive items in the grocery store thinking they are the healthiest choices only to find out there is another option that is just as healthy or healthier that costs less!! I would recommend downloading this app to anyone that is interested in changing the way they eat!
921,921,4,2013-04-09T04:50:16.000Z,Bugg16,Love it! But...,"First off, I really do like this app. It helps me control my calories without carrying a paper and pencil getting weird looks like I have a weird obsession hah. But, I'm only 16 and have to put my birth year up two years to get an account. So it kinda messes with the BMI I think. The store reminders aren't working on my iPod ( I think it's only an iPhone thing,although I don't see why it would matter, but who knows right?).  So all in all I really like the app, it is going to he'll control my weight ad lose some(: if you get this app you should be satisfied. Thanks."
922,922,5,2014-01-22T08:04:34.000Z,jcp6767,New to Fooducate,I've just started using this app and so far am very happy with it. I was driving past my grocery store the other day and heard my phone beep. It was a reminder to use Fooducate while I'm shopping. I love that it does that otherwise I probably would forget to use it when I really am going to the grocery store! Seems very reliable so far. Looking forward to any future updates although I can't think of a way to improve upon it as it is now. üòä
923,923,3,2014-05-09T14:17:21.000Z,MultitaskingDriver,Great but could have more features for price,"I love that this app alerts you to what's in foods based on your own settings and that it will grade foods and give you alternatives. It would be better if you could see nutrient reports and goal reports, and if it was easier to change foods or add them to other days, etc. I love the tips and the information included in the daily tips and newsletters, and I really like that you can be reminded to use the app when you arrive at stores that you choose. For the price though, it should also do all of the reporting that other food tracking apps do."
924,924,5,2015-02-05T14:43:36.000Z,Lisacpa,Fooducate is excellent!,"If you're trying to lose weight, reduce cholesterol, or just track your food intake, get this. I used the free version for a long time, which is quite good, but I upgraded to the premium version. Now I can look up a food by scanning its label, searching for restaurant foods, or entering fresh items. Fooducate has a vast library and will not only track calories, carbs, and nutrients, but it will give you lots of information about the food AND offer alternative foods. Best ""diet"" app out there!"
925,925,4,2015-04-01T00:39:01.000Z,J43S,Great Visual,"I started tracking foods in a diary a few months ago. I knew what I ate, but had no way of seeing the types of nutrients or calories.  I'm currently using this app and one other (still deciding which gives the best view of my progress) to track my daily diet. So far I really enjoy the app and the graphs it provides. The only downside has been when I needed to change previously entered data. For example, I went back for seconds and needed to add another serving. Took a moment to figure that out. Good app, keep adding new foods to keep it simple."
926,926,5,2015-04-11T17:33:31.000Z,Swiftburn,Fantastic health app,I am someone that has tried numerous food trackers. I have tried this app on the past with so so results. Decided to give it another go as i try to find the perfect food tracker app to go with my new Apple watch. This time around I actually give it a chance and rally dig into all the functions and spend time pitting in my food. After a couple of days I realized the potential of this great app. It's takes some time but give it a chance and you will love it.
927,927,5,2016-02-03T13:33:04.000Z,aviatortom,Excellent and handy food tracking App.,"I am a long time follower of the Lean for Life program by Cynthia Stamper Graff, president of the Lindora Institute, and this app is a convenient way to keep a daily action plan (DAP), in other words, a record of what I eat and drink, my weight, measurements, etc. I am on the go most of the time, and this app is much easier than writing things down on a DAP worksheet or going online to do it. I really love the nutritional information too. The charts are amazing and a great graphical depiction of my effort and progress."
928,928,5,2016-03-09T17:45:41.000Z,telosmachina,Best Diet Tracker,I have tried a decent number of diet trackers and calorie counter type apps. Fooducate is the best I have found. Overall just easy and well thought-out. The database is fairly extensive so the barcode scanning works most of the time. Their water tracking is kind of tacked on so I use a separate app. And the Apple Watch app is pretty basic. I'm hoping they keep improving those aspects since I went ahead and bought the lifetime subscription option. Worth the money in my opinion.
929,929,5,2017-01-18T01:37:23.000Z,kahruzorz,Great,"If I could give 10 stars I would. I don't even care about weight, I just like to be able to quickly get an assesment on a food product before I eat it. This app makes it easy to judge whether I should eat something or not, and the scan option makes it only take a few seconds. Plus its review of the food is very thorough unlike other bad apps that only take into account macros instead of actual ingrediants. I highly reccomend!! Great job with this app."

I forget to look at the serving sizes and actually having the app kinda forces me to not go for the junk food that I try to justify as healthy.... Darn."
931,931,5,2011-10-06T18:06:37.000Z,Jake135,I'm recommending it everyone.,"This app was an alternative suggested casually by a friend who counts Weight Watcher points.   Wow--I'm SO glad I followed up and downloaded it.  There is so much information here and it's very easy to use.  I've put a number of items I used to buy regularly back on the shelf.  (I thought I was pretty savvy but one 'healthy' treat I used to pick for my husband was a D- due to additives and stabilizers.). It's a little like having a nutritionist on call.  And I love the ""alternatives"" feature.  Big 5 stars!"
932,932,5,2012-09-24T00:03:53.000Z,Grecci5,Almost...,"The revised site is far from improved. When I want to read a long form Daily Tip I right into it. When I want to go back to the tips master page I have ti go all the way back to the main menu; ridiculous. When you fix this please make sure I land in the exact same spot on the master page; no annoying scrolling over and over. Also, the new more complex site is not any better really, just more complex and black and white ugly text. Where are the icons."
933,933,5,2012-09-26T16:08:52.000Z,rh_in_la,Wonderful unbiased info!,"I like this app for a bunch of reasons. Briefly, if you contact support, THEY ANSWER! Not always the case with app developers. I especially like the fact that it seems to be an unbiased analysis of both processed and unprocessed foods. With ""health"" apps, this is not always the case. It doesn't automatically vilify processed foods which is rare these days or so it seems to me. Just the facts as they see them. Good scanning of barcodes and a seemingly broad database of foods. I enjoy the look and feel as well. Good job."
934,934,5,2012-10-20T22:31:35.000Z,therealmikeytodd,Really handy while shopping!,"I use this at the grocery store almost every time I shop, now. It's so easy to find out about what's in the food I want to buy and get some kind of a rating to compare similar products so I know which one to buy and what to avoid. It helps me find out how healthy stuff really is. Kind of disappointing to learn that stuff I thought was okay is full of crap, but better to know, now, and buy healthier food than have unexpected health issues as I age‚Ä¶"
935,935,4,2013-06-26T20:36:39.000Z,rjfdlf,Restaurants?,"This app is fantastic when it comes to watching for harmful ingredients. I also like the alternatives button to help you shop smarter. It's great that it gives you an estimate on how many calories and carbs you should be eating if you want to loose a few pounds. I haven't scanned anything yet that it didn't have in it's database. I do wish there was a good list of restaurant foods though. Fast food, and larger chain restaurants would be very helpful. I'm sure it would be hard to get a true ingredients list but, just a calorie count would be helpful."

937,937,5,2015-02-24T22:40:27.000Z,Elissable,Using it everyday,I use this app everyday to look up what I'm eating. It puts food in a different t perspective and helps me avoid things that I tell myself is ok to eat. I love the ability to scan foods and instantly see its health grade to make quick and good decisions. I also love the explanations feature to explain why foods are graded the way they are. I also love that we can contribute to the app by adding foods that haven't been added yet! Can't wait to see this app grow further.
938,938,4,2015-07-14T18:09:23.000Z,RahThomas,Best app ever!,"I love this app! I first got it to be able to scan bar codes in the grocery store to find out about products before I buy them. It has since evolved and updated. I love the community section where you can connect with other users. There are some downsides, such as if you want anything custom or specific to your needs you have to pay for the pro version, but that's pretty normal in terms of apps. This is great if you're looking to eat healthier, lose weight, or otherwise want to manage your diet and eating habits."
939,939,5,2017-03-08T17:12:11.000Z,NoNstopAthlete,Great app for Great appetites,Many fitness apps don't live up to the hype or you simply stop using them after a while but I've been using Fooducate for months. One of the most useful features is the food scanner with the grade ratings. I use it constantly whether it be at Costco or Ralph's to evaluate how clean and nutrient dense any packaged food is when decide what to buy. I find that it doesn't encourage calorie counting (although it can accommodate to that) but rather promote clean and healthy eating.

This app helps me stay away from potentially harmful products, and has educated me on some of the harmful foods I've been eating/drinking. If the product is not in the data base you can take the pics yourself, and send the info via email very easily! Their research team will apparently do the analysis and then add it to the database. very addicting! You'll want to scan everything! May double your time spent at the grocery store.. Lol."

Though it may not be practical to scan every item you're shopping for at the grocery store, it IS a very helpful tool is learning about the foods in your home.  If I'm waiting for something to cook or am just curious I definitely scan items I frequently use."

I scanned EVERYTHING edible in my kitchen and i love that if you scan a product that Fooducate doesn't have, you can send the info in AND receive feedback.  I've already gotten feedback for 6 items.  Great, great, great!  Would be perfect if: 1-you could somehow fix it so that the WW information could be easily linked to my iTrackerBites app, and 2: tell us what constitutes a serving size."
943,943,5,2012-06-07T19:31:37.000Z,4385852,Helpful,"This app offers insights about food and products that otherwise would remain unknown. If Fooducate does not have a product in its database one can email photos of the product, nutritional info and ingredients to be reviewed and added. My complaint is that Fooducate evaluates foods differently, i.e. suggests eating frozen fruits and vegetables because these products are frozen at peak freshness but I'd rather not have frozen preservatives and prefer to stay away from freezer foods. App holds different dietary values but is still very useful."
944,944,3,2013-08-16T17:57:29.000Z,KayDee555,Sugar,I just installed this app and the first thing I scanned was Nature's Path Organic Pumpkin Flax Granola. The app gave it a B rating because of sugar however the sugar is evaporated cane juice as opposed to processed refined sugar. Big difference.  Not all sugar is bad and cane juice like coconut sugar and agave are low glycemic index sweeteners and are high in nutrients. The app needs to recognize this and if the concern is the caloric count it needs to look at the product as a whole.  When you click on more info on sugar you'll see that the app lumps all sweeteners together including artificial sweeteners and corn sugars which are genetically modified. This is an apples to oranges comparison and highly misleading.

Since I'm a senior and retired I have the time to prepare the meals and exercise. Fooducate has provided me with valuable information with getting my weight down without depriving my body of valuable nutrition which is critical on any weight loss program where ketone build up can reverse what your trying to accomplish. Many thanks Foodicate. You are very informative and we'll worth the money.
946,946,4,2014-06-21T04:27:23.000Z,Angelfoodie2,Add Recipe Link,This is a good educational tool to show what the subject should be eating. However I believe the subject would do much better if recipe suggestions were added. General healthy diets have fruits and vegetables in most diets. One could use good cooking and meal planning web sites to improve nutritional awareness and encourage users to cook at home and attend near by Farmers Markets!
947,947,5,2016-05-22T23:39:48.000Z,Kenny&Alisa,Food Finder Fantastic,"I don't use the app to track my calories and weight, However; this is hands down, the best app to find out if what you're eating is healthy or not, it tells me what's in my food, what possible chemicals or controversial additives are in the food, and it also grades the food from A to D, obviously A being the best. And what's more, when you scan something that's not entirely acceptable to put in your body, it will give you an alternative! It's Fantastic. This app is a keeper."
948,948,5,2016-09-19T14:13:56.000Z,NMZia,Best food tracker,"I would surprised to see that this app didn't have straight five stars, so I took the time to look at some of the lesser reviews. One is a review of fish sticks (seriously). Some only praise, but fail to give full stars. One requested the impossible (that the whole food database be off-line). Finally, one complained about the food search, which I think is just great. In conclusion, people can't find anything bad to say about it. Also, it's worth just spending the money on lifetime!"
949,949,5,2017-01-05T13:12:51.000Z,Teacher 1971,Wonderful,"At first I just used it to make me more aware of what I was eating.  I saw that there were much better choices once I graded the food, and I began looking for alternatives."
950,950,3,2011-05-23T20:31:56.000Z,lindstar,Hrm,"Good idea, bad execution. Manual entry for iphone 3G is a joke. Food scanner accurately scans UPCs, so why not fooducate? And since the scanner is obviously disabled on the 3G, as it doesn't even try to capture the UPC, there needs to be an error message or a note visible on the scanner screen, so those of us that forgot the scanner doesn't work on 3G will be reminded. I don't use the app every day and haven't used it for a week. Therefor the likelihood that I'll forget the scanner doesn't work is high."
951,951,4,2012-01-13T11:22:21.000Z,kroembke,"Good, but data collection needs improvement.","Very useful when at the store and trying to compare nutritional info on packages based on different serving sizes, etc. Be prepared to spend more time at the store!!! I encountered quite a few times when the app asked me to ""help them out"" by capturing uncatalogged food item info and sending it in. The ""help us out"" feature works well enough, but I don't want to use my data plan to send images of items to them. Isn't there a way to que these up then send them when I am on WiFi?"
952,952,3,2012-08-04T18:16:03.000Z,Gggg556,"Great app, but...","This is a very helpful app and is great for people to start paying attention to ingredients. However, the grading on products seems a bit flawed."
953,953,5,2013-01-22T14:07:13.000Z,SentinelAngel3,Love it! Couldn't ask for a better app!,"I have tried other apps similar to this one, and not many of them compare to what you can do in this one. I love how you can scan your food that you are consuming and it tells you all the nutritional facts about it. I also love that you can input your daily exercise routines and it calculates how many calories you have burned. There's just too much to list about why I love this app, I would recommend this app to everyone!"
954,954,5,2013-02-24T22:14:32.000Z,Vivacious Sagittarius,Very Helpful App!!,"I use this app to scan every food item I purchase and it couldn't be enough help!! I love how it is very accurate down to the T. Just wish they had more food variety. Some of the foods I scan aren't in the system so I have to take pics and send to fooducate......no biggie though. Other than that, I can't get enough of this app. Did I also mention you can track your calories and all the foods you eat in a day?! What are you waiting for?! Purchase this app!! IT'S FREE!!!"
955,955,3,2014-02-02T05:16:27.000Z,Nikbags,Needs improvement but I love it,"I love all of the tracking, options and suggestions. I wish I could search just in my recent foods, and that when searching all foods the results show in order from most popular among users to not. I wish you could edit the entry (like servings you've had or meal you had it for) after it's been entered instead of having to enter another of the same item or remove it and enter again. But the BIGGEST thing is that there needs to be a major camera interface improvement. I can barely ever get it to scan anything!"
956,956,5,2014-03-09T21:24:58.000Z,syntaxsonders,MUST DOWNLOAD!!,This app is AMAZING for people who really want to know if you're really eating healthy. Also gives daily news/scoops/tips on health foods. This is just wonderful. I hope I'll be able to update to the premium!
957,957,5,2014-03-16T21:11:48.000Z,Olgeecancount,Grocery shopping made easier!,"I love this app! Sometimes I'm in a time crunch (outside of grocery shopping) and can't always cook food. It's nice to know that I can see a letter grade for processed things and determine if they're worth my time. I don't use this as a primary took to determine if I should buy something or not, but it does give me some pause to think about whether I'm making a good choice or if something is worth the low letter grade every once in a while."
958,958,4,2014-04-08T16:55:11.000Z,mjchap,excellent,"Revised..  a bit... I really wish the was more food database. Almost everything I scan is not here. :( and it's all good food.. Like shrimp, meat. I am figuring out that you have to add food to favorites to save it."
959,959,5,2016-12-18T13:17:23.000Z,Y member,Love This App...hands down the best app!,"I use this app daily. I have recently lost 11 lbs tracking my diet and exercise (over a month timespan). I use this app while shopping to make decisions based on food selection. I love that you can input recipes and Fooducate gives you the nutritional breakdown. Lastly, the app works seamlessly with my Apple Watch! Thanks Fooducate for your continuous improvement, I have used this app for years and continue to believe this is the best nutrition and exercise app hands down!"
960,960,2,2011-06-22T00:14:43.000Z,shapeslicer,great for moms maybe? not for me,"First off, I like that this app points out things that might be of concern like ingredients and additives. The grades given for food, however, have proven to be pretty useless to me. I am an athlete and I was hoping that this app might help me choose better fuel for my runs. Alas, most sports nutrition products end up getting a D+ or C- grade which doesn't really help me compare. This is probably due to the high sugar and calorie contents of these foods, which is actually something I want to fuel a 10 or 15 mile run. Maybe this app might be good for moms looking to buy healthy for their kids, but I'm better off going back to reading the labels myself."
961,961,5,2013-03-25T18:25:00.000Z,AnnieAlaska,Best diet app ever!,"Love this app,  most comprehensive nutrition guide :D!"
962,962,5,2013-05-31T18:41:58.000Z,Bobakkabob,Very useful and easy to pick up,"Managed to set up my goals and start scanning all the food in my house in just under 15 minutes! Love this app and hope to use it to put more healthy things into my body...only question seems to be, is there any plan on introducing menus of items prepared at restaurants any time soon?! I frequent a coffee shop and deli quite regularly, and there seems to be no effective way of entering or scanning the items I eat there."
963,963,5,2013-07-04T19:02:35.000Z,lilcar,A must have app!,I got info about this app from a hospital dietician to watch sodium and carb intake. What a great app. It is amazing the crap manufacturers sneak into food. I've been eating vegetarian for a while only to find out many of the meat substitutes aren't vegetarian at all! You need this app if you care at all about eating better.
964,964,4,2014-02-19T01:52:18.000Z,Dkr2041,Great App!,"Easy to use and I love the grades it gives you on each food item. It sure makes you think before eating or buying something bad that you may have thought was good for you!  I would give this a 5 star, but I have given it a 4 because I would like to have a feature where you can add your own recipes as well as edit the food you logged each day without having to delete and re-add the item. Overall it's been very user friendly and helpful-overall I love the app! Thanks Fooducate!"
965,965,5,2014-10-06T20:27:59.000Z,Cmkrd,A food app that helps without guilt!,"I use the scan food rating guide daily and love that it doesn't judge my choices but does help me make better ones. I can consciously know what I eat. Buying a tortilla wrap, here's the best option. And if I must eat a chocolate bar well here's the best of the worst! It was also eye opening what I thought was healthy and most certainly are not! A life saver. I've been telling all my friends and was even prompted to write my first ever app review! Thank you."
966,966,5,2016-06-24T02:46:31.000Z,MNDB1,Probably my favorite app!!,"I was searching for an app my son could use as  he is legally blind and cannot read ingredient lists and nutritional information on packages. I downloaded the app to test myself and fell in love. What I like most about Fooducate is it takes the guesswork out of buying healthy and nutritional food. With just a scan of the barcode, I can read and understand healthy ingredients and others to avoid. Everyone in my family uses it now!!"
967,967,5,2016-07-15T13:19:12.000Z,Marisas03,Love it!!!,"I've tried calorie count and myfitnesspal but just never really liked either app. I love this app though. It's so much easier to use, and unlike the other two, I actually use it ever day and log in every day. Plus, I've stuck with my allotted calories. What I like most is the search feature. Instead of just a written list of foods you also get pictures so I can scroll through faster and find my food to log in. Love it!!!"

I do wish it had a multi add feature rather than just a make it a meal option. I don't always eat the same yogurt for breakfast. Being able to select each item I ate and add the items all at once would be much quicker and easier. It does educate and I love the community feature along with being able to read articles if I so choose. It's bright and easy to read, very user friendly. Try it!"
969,969,2,2016-11-07T23:02:33.000Z,Skumar75,Great concept but not perfect,"After hearing from a host in food network channel, I tried this app. Liked it but not that much to buy it. Few months later, purchased the app. I see no difference in the functionality between free and paid. The app is slower than ever and their push notifications won't work, when asked the technical support is not very happy to address the issue. Many food items have no nutritional information. They can't rely on users to update all of these. We send three pics, can't they enter or develop an app to transfer those data. I won't renew it after my first year."
970,970,5,2011-05-16T03:23:45.000Z,Jurbi,Love it!!!,"I'm surprised by some of the lower ratings... It seems like it is the phone that doesn't work, not the app... I have shaky hands and it scans perfectly and quick!!!  The only thing that would make it better, (and I believe they are working on it) is to be able to search categories instead of just scanning the products that you're already looking at, so you might find something you might not have known about!!!"
971,971,5,2012-08-28T13:05:26.000Z,Ann2900,Awesome!,"I love this app! Really helpful, it provides useful info for users who might be on a diet or simply want to eat better. I always wonder about the nutritional content of my food when grocery shopping (it can be difficult to tell sometimes) and this app helps to break down ambiguous ingredients, list any +'s and -'s etc in an easy to understand format. This is the only app I've ever recommended to multiple ppl! All of whom have loved it! :)"
972,972,5,2013-04-24T02:56:36.000Z,RashaBandak,Amazing,"I love this app, I honestly think this app saved my Family's life, I have a son one-year-old, I care about what I give him and the quality of the food that he gets, I didn't know before this app about GMO's genetically modified foods but thanks to this application, Which really educates you about everything in the product that might harm you, You just scan any product and the information comes out so easy to understand simple and amazing."
973,973,5,2013-08-16T22:44:53.000Z,My Name Is Um Nobody,Best App Ever,"I have been using this for a couple years now and everyone I have had download it loves it!! It probably finds what I scan 99% of the time, it's great while grocery shopping when you need information on a product ASAP... Scanning everything in my pantry I've been able to single out things I do not want in my diet and have been successful in replacing them w/ a healthier solution!! Download it today, you will not be disappointed!!"
974,974,5,2014-05-19T20:46:57.000Z,Sandykayc529,Love the customization level,I am a myfitnesspal junky. However I find it limiting on setting my macros to a specific number. So far my favorite feature is I can specify the exact amount of each macro I want for my day. There has already been two foods I was unable to scan and find but I hope in time the database will be as big as myfitnesspal. It was easy enough to submit pictures and nutritional information for too.
975,975,5,2014-06-29T23:12:58.000Z,thisnameislongke$harocks,I love fooducate,"I use it constantly. Very helpful. The only improvements I would want are it to have more foods, cuz I have searched for something and it is not there. I have given nutrition facts about something and it gave me an email but I could it would not be on there for a while. I want to search for my history a lot so I wish there was an easier way to find a specific thing. The health tracker is helpful. I also like the articles"
976,976,5,2015-01-31T17:56:32.000Z,Brown66,Mind blowing!!,Just flabbergasted to see so many food items Gmo labelled. Also I love the fact I can scan all grocery products I buy and see what affect it will have on me and my family. Definitely sticking with this in the new year 2015!  I love it!  If losing weight and changing the way you eat as a new lifestyle is your goal then use this app!  It will save your life and make you more aware of what you are putting in your mouth daily.
977,977,5,2016-12-05T14:29:56.000Z,Swimlikeadolphin,Life saver,"I've been feeling rundown and lousy and seriously wondering if I had some major health issues. I decided to start tracking my nutrition. This app has been informative, motivating and health saving. I feel younger and healthier now. I love this app and would recommend it to anyone who wants to be reflective on their decision making around eating.  I tried a few other apps and this one is far superior with nutritional information, ease-of-use, and fun."
978,978,5,2017-04-17T11:46:19.000Z,BoomerSooner1989,Great support for eating healthy,"I love this app and have recommended it many times! It focuses on eating healthy not just consuming fewer calories. I like that it doesn't promote certain product brands, but instead truly educates people on eating foods that are good for your body. It is very easy to scan codes and find out if something is a good choice. It also is a great way to track your food consumption as well as your calories burned through exercise."
979,979,4,2017-05-26T13:23:02.000Z,xrobotlovex,Great dieting tool,"This app has really helped me realize how much sugar and salt I was consuming. It's also made me measure my food so that I can keep accurate records which has definitely helped with my over eating and portion control issue. I wish I could figure out how to add foods (it says I need a mail account?) and there are some ""premium"" features that I think should be free (like the breastfeeding diet!) but all in all I really like this app. It's easier to use than any diet app I've used (and given up on) in the past."
980,980,5,2011-04-18T11:18:39.000Z,sweetmiss,It Will Save Your Life,"If I could vote this app ""Most Likely to Save Your Life"", I would! Also, I was impressed with its design- one of the best I've ever seen. It does a great job of answering all those little pesky questions such as, ""Is high fructose corn syrup really bad for you?"" It does so in an honest and unbiased way and supports its info with links to scientific info or supporting documents, where appropriate. It's a must buy! If you're really interested in educating yourself about nutrition, you won't be sorry!"
981,981,5,2011-05-18T19:22:59.000Z,LaneNH,Insightful!,"We are enjoying this app immensely. We've probably scanned 1/3 of the products in the kitchen already. Commentary after food scans provides thought provoking details. It has given us much pause w/r/t ""hidden"" ingredients. For example, we avoid MSG but we never considered to look for other equivalents! Yikes. At the very least it has given us reason to pause and consider a food choice...so much for mindless binges....gonna have to make them a thing of the past."
982,982,5,2012-02-24T20:56:14.000Z,Lizdol2001,"Great app, it's a must have!!","My bf n I LOVE this app! We r both on a path to living a healthier life. We r always making sure that the food we buy at the store is healthy and/or an okay product to consume by looking/reading the nutrition label of the item. However, now with Fooducate we can easily scan n see why the food we pick is either good/bad to eat as well as what alternatives I have if the food item has a bad rating n/or not so healthy to eat! Try it out! ;-)"
983,983,5,2012-02-26T15:49:21.000Z,Charlie1956,It's as important as my shopping list!,"It keeps me on track for healthy choices! I really like this app because of it's usefulness when shopping for good food choices outside of fruits and vegetables. Before I was always having to read labels watching for true whole grain, low fat, low sugar etc. This app does that for me. I do wish it included more HEB brands..they really have good products. Maybe they will add more of them as more Texans hear about this great app tool."
984,984,5,2012-08-15T07:38:46.000Z,martin726,Excellent for healthy eating,Great app if you're starting to diet and are unfamiliar with what to look out for. Reading the nutrition label is like trying to read a chemistry book. And what this app points out are some crucial information that you don't get by reading the side of a box. Since I've gotten this app I've used it every time I shop and it's been extremely helpful. Truly recommend it!! Only con: need to expand healthy alternatives; list is very limited.
985,985,5,2013-11-19T13:09:10.000Z,Liiphsong,Unbelievably Great!!!,"I am not only a food junkie, but a diet/healthy lifestyle app junkie as well.  Since purchasing this app, I have deleted all of my other diet/healthy eating apps.  This app has it all - scanner, food choice grading with better selection alternatives,  calorie counter with exercise inclusion, water counter, and much, much more bundled in one user-friendly app.  The only downside I can think of in reviewing this app is that I cannot give it more than five stars."
986,986,5,2014-01-17T22:44:16.000Z,Rach5825,Fantastic!,"Just what I've been looking for. I use this app all the time at the store. It's not hard to use, I just open the app scan the barcode and it gives me all the information I need, from highly processed foods, to high sodium, to sugar content, this app is great if you're trying to have a healthy lifestyle. If the information you want is not in the app scan it and send them the information and they will update it!"
987,987,4,2014-02-26T13:38:36.000Z,vanlaux,"love it, BUT","we're all fighting for gmo-labeling on our foods, right? and if it isn't fair that organic farmers have to pay big bucks to get the 'certified' label on their foods, then how is it fair that fooducate is withholding their gmo knowledge from those of us without premium accounts? i think we all agree that we shouldn't have to pay to know what is in our food and how it was grown; so why don't you lead by example, fooducate?"
988,988,3,2015-01-16T14:47:19.000Z,sharewell,Good But.....,"I like that it has pictures of the food and that it gives you food grades(A.B,C,D).  It also gives you daily point and daily calories allowed which is good if you like the points program; however, the food database is small especially for restaurant items. The My Fitness Pal has everything, I've never had to add an item on that app while I have had to put in a lot of effort to add foods on this app.  One final note, servings are only available in .5 increments which is not always accurate, sometimes I'd like to put in 3/4 or 1/8 of a serving."
989,989,4,2015-04-17T16:56:23.000Z,Jojkxjo,Read this if you're wise,"It's not specific in some effects of the foods. For example, with the research I done on artificial colors, they state that high doses of ""Red dye...""to rats cause cancer, which they say they banned. That doesn't mean we can get get cancer if we eat that specific item we scanned. Also they say others things but I'm lazy to say, just do research. My suggestion is to scan and do research on what shows red in writing, you may change your mind. Don't always trust what people say, be wise and stay happy."
990,990,5,2011-05-15T04:21:52.000Z,lauren m:),My favorite app,"This app is my most used app by far. I'm not into calorie counting and but do like to try and put healthy food in my body but sometimes it's not clear in the grocery store what's actually healthy and whats not. I love how easy it is to use and if a food doesnt have the healthy rating that you thought it would, fooducate has suggestions for you to eat instead and tells you why it's not that healthy. And scanning the food is really fun :)"
991,991,5,2011-08-03T15:44:19.000Z,SpunkyBill,Happy Appy,"This has been well worth the cost (a tiny bit of space on my phone)--it's free! True, some of the foods you'll scan will be missing, but you can be part of the solution and easily submit them to Fooducate. The product info is very helpful when shopping and helps you look past product marketing (which runs close to fiction) and get to the real food values. Quit wasting your time reading this and try it...!"
992,992,4,2012-03-16T04:09:42.000Z,Allie.ballie9,Pretty good,"I think out of all the possible nutrition apps, this is one of the better ones. It definitely helps you realize what exactly is in your food and why its there (emulsifier, preservative, etc.), and its range of producs it has grades for and gives reviews on is impressive. The one drawback of this app is that the information it gives on products will start getting repeptitive and some products will have a ""bad grade"" without an explanation as to why other than ""they're a chip/snack product""."
993,993,5,2013-04-13T11:09:41.000Z,Rick.Cain,Very Useful,"I do not use shopping apps, but I have found Fooducate to be very useful in the supermarket for several reasons. 1. I can instantly check on the nutritional quality when trying to compare similar products with different brand names. 2.  The shopping list is useful and right on my phone, so there is no paper list. 3. The A, B, C, D . . . grading feature is an immediate indicator to rejecting or further considering a food item (e.g., a D gets little consideration)."

Thus I always have my own grocery list right on my iPhone! There are times that I don't make the right choice. Love the alternative option of finding a healthier choice! The food scanner is my favorite!  I can take my iPhone to the grocery store & scan my food choices with my Fooducate App. This comes in really handy!

This APP has already helped my family stay healthy! We thought we knew it all about food and the food industry and nutrition but Fooducate teaches us very vital information that we need to stay healthy. You won't believe the amount of information you can learn through this valuable tool!
997,997,5,2014-07-23T05:17:07.000Z,JessicaEmma7,In LOVE!!,"I absolutely love this app!!! It allows you to track EVERY calorie that you put in your body and even allows you to track calories burned! When you first set it up it'll ask you your weight, intentions (to gain/loose), and it'll tell you how many calories a day you need to consume! If you work out you can input it and it'll track it! This app is an amazing tool to weight loss success! I'm down 6lbs in 8 days (and I'm NOT starving myself!)!!!"
998,998,5,2015-04-01T12:14:43.000Z,Heyitsginny,Best one I tried,"I went on line, compared, and tried Atkins, ""Carb Diet"" and this. By far this is the best. Carbs and calories, fairly easy to use, decent database...helps me look at whole picture whereas before I was only focusing on net carbs. Adding calories made a difference!!! I think their estimates of calories burned during exercise is high. And occasionally just shuts down out of the blue during entries. But again, best I've tried so went with the 5 star"

Tried several before finding this one. Very easy, clean, intuitive interface. Love the tracking device and how it can be personalized. I'm trying the free version for now but will likely pay for the year subscription soon. Thanks for a great app. Probably one of the most important ones I'll ever own."

1001,1001,5,2013-05-10T23:52:37.000Z,Kdg0000,Absolutely love this app,"Easy to use interface, at-a-glance food rating, and it actually made shopping with my 14-year-old son fun.  He enjoyed scanning the items and seeing their rating, and he made smart choices. I learned that some of the choices I was making when buying groceries such as cereals and ""healthy"" sandwich meats were not so smart.  I have recommended this app to many friends, and they are also happy with it."
1002,1002,5,2013-06-06T16:07:19.000Z,rpeters2396,Best App Ever!!,"I LOVE THIS APP!! As others have said, I thought I was fairly knowledgable about the foods that I eat, I was dead wrong! I love the fact that you can not only scan the barcode, but also look up specific items by name. Other awesome features include: alternatives to the food you scanned, comparison of two different foods, GMO info, and weekly contests that cost nothing! they also have web support and a fb page."
1003,1003,4,2014-04-08T05:57:45.000Z,suaping1,Very helpful.,"I liked this app a lot because it helps you track not only the calories you take but it breaks down the nutrient part too. It made me aware of the amount of carbs, protein, and fat I take in every meal. It also had a bonus of tracking the kind of food I consume (i.e., gmo or ngmo). The thing that I wished they improve is the availability of product information. Some of the products are not yet in the system. But other than that I highly recommend this app to anyone."
1004,1004,1,2014-11-06T11:29:38.000Z,Mommylove84,Tons of missing food & inaccuracies,I bought the premium version of this app ($40) to replace myfitnesspal and have something that gives better information about each food. It's such a great concept except a lot of the foods I scan are not in their system so I'm then prompted to add it for them. Then when foods are in the system they are very often wrong nutrition info including stating they are non vegetarian when they really are or saying their are GMOs when there are not. On top of that my scanner only works about half the time. So I paid $40 to use an app that barely works and I am spending time adding foods for them. I'm so disappointed.
1005,1005,3,2015-03-12T04:45:26.000Z,Alexibaby,3 Stars,"Fooducate is better used as a reference than as a food logger. MyFitnessPal does a much better job in regards to having many foods available to log so you don't have to manually type in every ingredient. This app does show more information about the actual content of the food (not just the calories). 3 stars. I prefer MyFitnessPal, purely because it is more user-friendly and you are able to easily connect with friends, as opposed to Fooducate. This app is best for someone who eats mainly natural/non-processed foods. MyFitnessPal is better for the average person."
1006,1006,5,2015-03-15T23:57:34.000Z,srz2,Amazing App - Must have if you are trying to eat healthy,This app is wonderful and extremely helpful.
1007,1007,5,2016-01-27T06:48:02.000Z,Sammiebean1217,Amazing app!!,This app is so helpful in so many ways for me. I've been using it for 2 weeks and have lost 10 pounds so far. It's great because it makes it so easy to see what you're putting in your body. It rates your food and actually tells you why it was rated that way and alternative choices if you need it. I recommended it to several people and they love it too. This app is literally changing my life. I love it.
1008,1008,5,2016-10-17T11:29:51.000Z,cccc1013927,Educational and useful,"Fooducate is by far the best fopd tracking app out there. Not only can you track calories and nutrition, as well as look up specific products, but the app will actually tell you which foods to avoid and which to buy based on a health scale. It will tell you what grade each food item you eat is and why, as well as offer helpful tips and educational explanations. It is well worth the trouble of inputting your foods!"
1009,1009,4,2017-04-20T15:06:19.000Z,Besidaa,Not quite 5 stars yet,"I would rate 5 stars, but I have only been using it for a few days now. The app is better than I thought it would be. I absolutely love the rating system that it has for food products. It also explains why it has the rating. Also, if a nutrition label is off, wrong or missing, you can send in pictures of it."
1010,1010,5,2011-04-29T20:37:55.000Z,lrs77,Amazing App for Smart Food Choices,"I recently downloaded this app based on a clients testimonial she recommended using this FREE app after she started the 24 Day Challenge and needed to make some smarter food decisions, and hates reading LABELS!!! I'm recommending it to all of my clients, who have iPhones, to use this when they decide its time to make better choices in their grocery shopping and food preparation, especially when they re on the 24 Day Challanges and thereafter for the BEST results."
1011,1011,5,2011-05-24T02:18:46.000Z,8senicus8,Free app with excellent customer service!?,"I was scanning everything within reach after downloading this app. I scanned a bag of tortilla chips that wasn't in the database. I did not take the pics to send to the Fooducate team, but a few days later someone else did. Fooducate sent me a message informing me that the info has been added to the database. The info this app provides is great and the follow up and customer service make it amazing! Download now!"
1012,1012,5,2014-05-13T16:22:40.000Z,Zpfeif,This is amazing!,"I love this app, it has helped open my eyes to undercover unhealthy foods. I also use it every day at work (teaching) to check allergens in the kids foods, frankly I was surprised to find how much crud/fillers are in food. The diary for tracking food is so easy to use and I love the newsletter full of healthy tips. Thank you so much for this wonderful app! This makes my healthy lifestyle choice easier to reach and fun. I recommend this app to any one."
1013,1013,5,2014-06-18T16:11:03.000Z,Kuchk868,Lovin' It,"I've only recently found this app but must say that I'm loving it so far regarding the grading system used to help me sort through all the food products that are available out there.  I want to be educated and make sure I made good, healthy and conscious food decisions because it definitely plays an integral part of your life!"
1014,1014,3,2014-10-20T02:22:59.000Z,Snoooo86,Don't like the update,"I can't stand the update. Tracking gmo's and sugar content use to be free. Along with eating heart healthy and now since doing the update, I have to pay for them!!? This irks me so bad considering I've had this app since it came out."
1015,1015,4,2015-01-27T15:49:00.000Z,Mrs. Robocoach,41 yr old Wife and Mom,"Got the free version of the app after my baby was born in July, but really didn't do anything with it. Purchased the 1 yr plan and have been using it religiously since 1/5/15 and, as of this morning, I've lost 9lbs!!! (Due to a recent shoulder injury, the weight lose is based strictly on dietary changes; NO exercise.  And I allow myself a cheat day once per week where anything goes!).  It really helps me hold myself accountable for what and how I'm eating. I recommended it to all my Facebook friends!"
1016,1016,5,2015-03-05T02:12:28.000Z,Florida Chuck,A fantastic app,"I recommend this app for everyone who is concerned about their diet and health. I use it s lot at the store while shopping. I've pulled products from the shelf, scanned them with the app, and then put them back after reading the results. But when I find a food with a good result it often will become one of my regular foods. I love specially like the emails I get with nutritional advice. You can't go wrong with this app."
1017,1017,5,2015-05-11T01:44:13.000Z,Eyelikeet,Easiest diet tracker app I've used to date,Fooducate provides a variety of food choices from  commercial to homegrown to track with a detailed list of notional in for each item. Interaction with other users for support and feedback. But my favorite part that makes it stand out from ALL the other apps is that it interfaces with the iPhone/iPad Health Kit; logging all your information on you device for you.
1018,1018,5,2016-05-26T04:58:49.000Z,CupCakeFool!,Simply Excellent!,"This, hands down, is the best food nutrition app I have come across. It not only shows me the nutrition metrics but it also provides explanations for why a food item is good or bad. Not only that, it provides a list of better alternatives for you to try on your next meal. It truly does a fantastic job of educating users about nutrition. I will certainly be purchasing lifetime subscriptions to their products! Thank you awesome app peeps :)"
1019,1019,5,2017-01-02T15:41:35.000Z,Emily Loryn,Great App!,"This is a terrific app for weight loss and nutrition! I've been using it for about 2 months and have lost 7 pounds (13 more to my goal!) It not only counts calories, but also gives food ratings. Trying to eat only A's and B's has really helped me change my habits. I have the full version and it keeps track of added sugar. That's been a key for me as well. The community chat is great and the app itself is easy to use."
1020,1020,5,2011-08-11T17:35:05.000Z,Chaos000,Rethinking my pantry now!,"Just got this app on a whim because I saw the icon in an ad. Went to my pantry and randomly scanned some food items. Amazing discoveries!! I thought I was a careful shopper but this app uncovers many dirty little food secrets. Its not all negative and scary: in fact my pantry gets plenty of good grades too. Mostly though, I love the quick and easy info I get when I scan. This app is going to be one I use every day.  Thank you Fooducate makers!"
1021,1021,5,2012-08-23T01:07:25.000Z,brtyle,Most loved and used app I haveüç¥üçâ,This app has so many useful features that I don't know where to start!
1022,1022,5,2013-02-19T14:53:27.000Z,Clutter free wannabe,Great app!,"As a physician, I think this app is really nice in terms of simplifying what are good food choices for my patients.  I understand fooducate is trying to roll out versions or updates that include special diets.  I think it would be really helpful to be able to specify all the dietary needs of an individual. For example, low sodium and carb control. But all that said I think this app is wonderful... If only more of my patients were tech savvy!"
1023,1023,4,2013-03-17T14:31:27.000Z,Rvr5269,Great app for someone interested in losing weight,"Love the scan option, also love that if an item isn't in the database you can send its info in and they will eventually add it for you. However, I'd really like to have it track my other nutrients other than just calories. Love that it reminds you to add your meals and love that it warns against GMOs and other health risks. Exercises are kind of lacking. Most of the time is have to use another app to track that and then manually add it to this one."
1024,1024,3,2014-06-27T16:30:55.000Z,T2iJenn,Inconsistent,I like this app in theory.  I have seen several circumstances of products whose nutritional facts and ingredient list do not match what it says on Fooducate. Within the app I have tried to select 'contact support' to report issues I have found and it just takes me back to the home screen.  Functionality for that needs to be improved.  Also I have seen items that have gotten very poor ratings and their alternatives that they suggest are exactly the same but get a better rating.  Doesn't make much sense to me.
1025,1025,5,2014-06-29T00:48:41.000Z,aStrick7,Very impressed,"This is hands down the best diet/nutrition app I've ever used. Lots of apps track calories and basic nutrients, but I've never found another that tracks as efficiently for me as this one. I can finally use an app to keep with my goal of cutting carbs and upping protein! Plus, having a feature that suggests healthier alternatives to the food you already have is an absolute life saver. Would definitely recommend."
1026,1026,3,2015-01-10T00:25:16.000Z,Concerned nutritionist,Use responsibly,"This app has a tracking option which is amazing and it grades food items to give tHe consumer an idea of what the food means. Aside from this it offers a community board where anyone using the app can make comments, ask questions, and support one another. This is wonderful, unfortunately the makers of the app do not regulate what is out on the board and I see a lot of wrong information being shared, just recently someone was advertising herbalife as the solution to everything. Wonderful app just needs monitoring."
1027,1027,5,2015-08-27T16:10:55.000Z,CassG,Great Nutritional Information!,"Comparing Fooducate to My Fitness Pal, I much prefer Fooducate because of the nutritional information and grading of foods in its database, as well as the user's ability to add foods to the database. I used MFP several years ago and don't recall this feature. Fooducate is easy to use, helps you track your caloric intake and physical activity, and also posts articles on health and nutrition. I'm thrilled that all of these features are in one app!"
1028,1028,3,2016-12-27T16:42:22.000Z,Mariasws54,New Year's Resolution..ers!!!,"If you're looking for an App to help you learn how to take control of your appetite, this is IT!!  Not only does it help you learn about which foods are better for you..and gives you alternative suggestions, the member community is GREAT!  Lots of people with lots of experiences and knowledge willing to support you every step of the way!  No judgements, no 'attacking!' ...just helpful motivation!!  Remember:  the change you want to make can't be immediate to be long-lasting. This is a LIFESTYLE change!  Come join us!  You'll be glad you did!!!"
1029,1029,5,2017-05-29T03:29:48.000Z,HipHopGuru_,Must-Have App for a Healthy Lifestyle,"Very thankful for such a beneficial app to track weight loss progress, view healthy meal ideas, and search for almost every food item currently available on the market today. The Fooducate team performs all necessary research (with citations!) to effectively inform users about what they are consuming. With this app, there is virtually no reason to be uneducated about what you are consuming each day. Thank you!"
1030,1030,4,2011-10-11T18:37:37.000Z,Helpermonkey3,Almost Perfect,"This is a well-designed app that is both easy to use and useful. The adds in the free version are not intrusive and do not interfere with using the app. My only criticism is the lack of detailed information on nutritional values. Fooducate gives a ""grade"" and the total calories. It does not tell you how many calories come from carbohydrates or unsaturated fat, for example. Does not provide specific ingredients. Fooducate did tell me that they are going to provide this info in future version."
1031,1031,5,2011-11-16T01:08:02.000Z,Buddygee74,Great app!,"I love this app! No problems thus far. My only negative is that when your shopping it doesn't always have the information for ""house brands"" like those specific to a store such as aldi or trader joes, or off-brands like those carried at Costco and such. The app gives u ability to scan and file information yourself, but I find difficult to get whole label scanned for nutrition info. Other than that five stars!ÓåµÓåµÓåµÓåµÓåµ"
1032,1032,5,2012-09-15T15:30:56.000Z,Obogans,"Love, love this App!","No matter what type of diet you are using, Weight Watchers, Low Carb, Low Calorie or some other type this is a great tool. Not only do you get your calorie or point value, you also get complete nutritional value, this app let's you know if there is gluten or salt and how much. It also tells you if it's overly processed. All this information is based on serving size and allows for an informed decision before you take that first bite."
1033,1033,4,2013-06-10T01:57:16.000Z,Bwanasonic,Great for tracking brand-name foods.,"This app delivers most of what I was looking for, but it's a little weak on generic food items. Produce items are well covered, but try searching milk, eggs, meat, grains, pulses, cheese, and you are presented with lists of brand-name products, with no easy way to select just generic 2 eggs, chicken breast, 4 oz ground beef, 1/2 cup brown rice,etc. You can enter these items, but you have to do the nutrition info and food grading yourself. A better database of generic food items would make this a 5-star app."
1034,1034,5,2014-01-01T01:41:58.000Z,MemphisRunner,Best app for a healthy life,"Leading a healthy lifestyle sounds easy enough, right? Could be, but there are a lot of obstacles trying to divert our attention from eating healthy, making healthy choices, and exercising. Fortunately, FOODUCATE"
1035,1035,4,2014-01-19T17:15:57.000Z,C-Me,Good App for Basic Recordkeeping,"I've used this app for a while with great results. BUT I have noticed that the database of entered food that comes with the app has redundancies and errors; there are some foods that are exactly the same with different calorie amount (for example). If you use this program, you cannot -- and should not -- rely solely on the database, but you should double check the labels and, if unsure, check other sources."
1036,1036,4,2014-01-23T15:02:56.000Z,I pref online version,Best app out there but still could improve,"It's by far the easiest app to use. However, there are a few things that bother me. First, they don't track sugar, which is one of the major belly fat causes. Seems odd bc we are trying to lose weight!  Second, they don't let you add an item from yesterday to today. That's annoying. Yes, they keep a list of recent items, but usually it's just faster to rescan than deal with that all over again."
1037,1037,5,2014-12-30T03:10:48.000Z,New Unhappy Customer,Great App,I'll keep this short because I don't usually do this but this app is great. I found it today by accident and am amazed by the wealth of information it provides. I went grocery shopping today and spent most of the time scanning everything I picked up and seeing how fooducate rated it and its recommendation for an alternative.
1038,1038,3,2015-07-15T02:24:23.000Z,Tobywhankanobie,"OK, but beware of premium","Overall this ap is good for tracking calories and a lot of nutritional info. I upgraded to premium to track how much cholesterol I was eating. But when they say you can ""track cholesterol"" with the premium, they mean enter in your score results from the doctor's office--not track your daily intake of it. Not worth it to upgrade to the premium versions. Also, I'm not sure how to manage the Fooducate points. Today, I am 200 calories under my goal, my calorie quality grade is A- so why am I over on my Fooducate allotment?"
1039,1039,1,2016-11-28T19:50:31.000Z,Ela is Born,Bare Basic Minimum,"Unless you want to pay one of their monthly fees and I don't, this app is pretty useless. Everything that would make this a useful app, requires the ""pro"" (fee) version. For example, I can't update my weight, BMI, add exercise activities (outside of the app (Nike+) and other features that would help me to achieve my goals."
1040,1040,5,2011-07-07T03:52:30.000Z,HeIIoKelsey,Couldn't get much better!,"I've been with fooducate since almost the beginning. It was a great app and an awesome concept with so much potential- and boy, after such a short amount of time, they've already made it practically perfect! Let me tell you what, this app changed my life. I started eating only foods with a and b grades and I never could have imagined that I would ever have this much energy! I love everything now!"
1041,1041,5,2012-01-09T00:17:55.000Z,missmelissamay,Great app overall,"This app has surprised me. I eat pretty healthy but found that some of the stuff I have been eating has not been as nutritional as I think. This is awesome for helping to sort out the massive amount of information out there about what foods are good for you! My only complaint is that sometimes things are not listed or registered, so the more people who use it and add to it, the better it will get."
1042,1042,5,2012-05-02T02:20:33.000Z,Local1st,Obsessed!,Seriously a life saver! I used to spend double the time grocery shopping reading all of the ingredients! Now I scan and done! Most times I find something better. The only thing is that the better option usually isn't available at main grocery stores so I now shop at sprouts and trader joes.
1043,1043,3,2013-04-03T17:22:55.000Z,AlexB1985,"Great app, sometimes misleading","Great idea and format.  Unfortunately, some information is based on old rebutted research, or just straight hippie paranoia or misinformation from ""research"" that isn't credible.  For example, MSG sensitivity is a myth, as you would be allergic to a naturally occurring compound in your body if this was the case (and there has never been a confirmed case of such a disorder).  If you have special dietary needs or need to watch your food intake. make sure to educate yourself on the facts and maybe even consult with a good nutritionist or doctor in conjunction with using this app."
1044,1044,5,2014-04-03T03:58:30.000Z,Kloves2run,Best ever!,"I love this app! It's so user friendly and has many features that are incredibly useful without upgrading to a pro version. It's really easy to look up foods and even add them to the database if they're not listed. This app is a great reference beyond just calorie count--there is a ton of information about food additives, sugar sources, other chemicals, etcetera. It's super handy to add foods to a food tracker and exercise too. Wonderful!"
1045,1045,1,2014-10-17T14:47:19.000Z,Xlmichael31,You don't deserve a ban,"I speak the truth and mostly the truth. Well this app doesn't like honest opinions so it banned me for saying what I thought was true. The whole point of the app is to learn, but clearly they'll ban you if you say something ""incorrectly"". I didn't offend the person, curse at the person, I just gave my honest opinion about the food they ate. If they don't like my honesty, instead of a fake statement such as ""wow how healthy, looks delicious"" then they can go and do business with themselves. If you like to be fake and give fake opinions, then download it, otherwise stay very, very far away from it. This app deserves every 1 star rating it can get."
1046,1046,4,2015-01-26T13:19:46.000Z,rimorton,Easy to use and informative,The UI changes pretty often and sometimes not for the better. Any change should make the most frequently accessed items easier to find but they seem to add an extra tap every now and the. That cost them one star. The information is really helpful in leading a healthy life and the data integrates with Apple Health well. I am starting to use it daily and on shopping trips to avoid GMOs and track my diet.
1047,1047,5,2015-06-28T15:41:27.000Z,Lima60,Excellent App,"It is very useful application, you have all the information and easily you can pursue your your diet goals."
1048,1048,5,2015-12-07T01:03:28.000Z,Diegos0230,Awesome!,This app has clearly identified and open eyes to look for my favorite foods that should be an A or B safe to eat products. And better answers to understand what those ingredients are in the Nutrition list too. Not everything in the market is safe for us to keep a healthy diet balance. Download and see for your self. Check out Fed Up Movie too. It's sad we are being sold this items in the market.
1049,1049,5,2015-12-14T17:59:23.000Z,kfeld512,Excellent,"This app confirms the old adage that knowledge is power. It allows you to have a much better sense of what you‚Äôre eating, how much of it you‚Äôre eating - and if you should be eating it at all. And it makes it kind of fun too. The Pro features are definitely worth it, as it allows you to track protein, fat, sodium, etc, as well as weight and other medical info. Support person was helpful and super nice too"

When your @ the store and about to make a food choice...you have a super easy, really fast way to assess your choice to see if it's all it can be for you.  Quick & easy way to offer alternative & healthier choices.  It's points out products that have controversial additives that could be carcinogenic!  It's a really fun way to help you quickly make better food choices...and it's free!  Love it!!!"
1051,1051,5,2012-02-05T19:41:13.000Z,Momnce3,Eating healthy (finally),I just found out that I have some health concerns that require me to watch what I eat. It seems overwhelming at times but Fooducate is really helping me realize I can do this. I can make the right decisions in what to eat. I know my family is eating healthier too. My doctor is impressed with the way the program is assisting me making appropriate food choices. Great program and easy to use. Thank you.
1052,1052,5,2013-01-01T00:39:21.000Z,ShannonShumaker,For Health And Knowledge,"As an entertainer I love to push myself to limits I couldn't see the day before. Therefore if I want the results, I need to eat satisfyingly to my mental goals. This app is everything and then some! It breaks down all key ingredients and what could hurt or help me. They rate all foods in their category from an A to F scale (They're honestly rated; I haven't seen an A+ yet). I recommend this to anyone wanting to take their knowledge to the next level."
1053,1053,5,2013-04-23T06:29:59.000Z,Daily Monster,Fooducate Review,"LOOOOOVE this app! It makes it so easy to not only stick to a healthy eating plan, but to also know which foods are the most healthy for your plan. Once your eyes are opened as to what is really in some of the food we all eat, it's blatantly obvious how harmful it is to our bodies. Fooducate helps you find the healthy/organic foods that will help you not only lose weight, but detoxify your body from the toxins that are in GMO foods. Highly recommend!"
1054,1054,4,2013-06-05T02:30:48.000Z,Pastor Andy G.,Awesome,"I love this app. I take it out each time we go grocery shopping. It helps me decide and find the healthier product, tells me why a product was given its rating and why certain ingredients should be avoided. I've also learned a few things that got me to switch from a product that I thought was good to something better...and this is just the basic use of it. I just learned there's a whole lot more to this app that I have yet to utilize."
1055,1055,5,2013-09-14T03:54:01.000Z,Jh087,Relieved,"I have been looking for a calorie/serving diary app alllll day! I am so relieved to find it...I was about to develop one for myself. The barcode scan works great and the database is up-to-date. It also included BMI calculation and info. That's great! The suggested calories for height, age and goal weight is correct. It also has FoodPoints (food grades) and alternative recommendations. I love that! I recommend this app for anyone looking for a genuinely helpful calorie counter."
1056,1056,5,2014-02-12T22:03:26.000Z,BrenB,Brenda,"This app has been very helpful in the grocery store. It assists in making healthier choices.  I am being held accountable for each food item I take in.  Although some items are not readily available by scanning, I'm sure to find something comparable to enter.  You always have the choice in helping the app by providing pictures and nutrition information so it can be added."
1057,1057,5,2014-02-13T03:51:17.000Z,SWD3842,Love this app!,This app is great! I follow weight watchers and am able to use this one without paying the additional for theirs! I am amazed at all of the items I scan that are in the Fooducate data base. I also like that I am able to add an item if it's not available to my foods. Fooducate adds it to their database quickly too! This app makes keeping a food diary fun and easy! I'm well on my way to swimsuit season!
1058,1058,5,2014-04-25T00:05:11.000Z,Jazmyn Cherie,Loooooove this app!! Best one for weight loss!!,I love everything about this app!!! I downloaded it after seeing it in a magazine & have found it my duty to tell ALL of my friends & coworkers about it. Easiest & most helpful tool to help aid weightloss. We all know we have to count calories but searching or inputting it yourself is a drain & you get bored/over it after a day. Fooducate makes everything easy with its scanner!! Love love love!!
1059,1059,5,2016-10-06T09:36:44.000Z,bethiebuch,Best All Around Nutrition App,This app is great whether you are dieting or eating for health.  I refer to the site every day and have learned so much about the nutritional value of a variety of foods.  It's easy to scan a product at the grocery using this app to determine if it's healthy or simply advertised as healthy.  Often I find that foods promoted as healthy or junk food disguised as healthy.  It also gives healthier choices.
1060,1060,5,2011-04-25T19:44:28.000Z,AustinGramma,A Winner ... With potential to be even netter,"I just got this app but I'm impressed. SO easy to scan a barcode and get a rating. I'm hoping they'll give more reasons for their ratings in the future. Also, can't personalize ratings now, but they say that's coming. I hope this will mean we can add filters like ""gluten free."" They also make it very easy to use iPhone to send them new products to add to their database. Way to go, developers!"

My parents recently lost weight, so they usually payed attention to mostly just calories, so I was always interesting in that too. Bu with this app, I now know there's more to being healthy than just calorie count! I'm looking forward to eating healthful foods. Thanks Fooducate!"
1062,1062,4,2011-07-08T12:11:47.000Z,cachopa,Love it!,"This is easy to use and fun to see what you thought was healthy really isn't!  Just scan and wait for the results!  It even gives you healthier alternatives. However, I didn't give it 5 stars because I would like to know where I can find these healthier options. It shows and tells you about these products but some are not easy to find at regular grocery stores. maybe on the next update we'll see this!  Other than th"
1063,1063,4,2011-11-27T06:47:50.000Z,Newly educated foodie,Nice app,"This app is easy to use and provides great info on why a food is not good for you and suggestions for food that is. If they do not have info on a food, they have you photograph and send the label to them by email. It is great to know that they are trying to improve. My only quibble is that there could be better options offered for healthy alternatives to junk food like chocolate. The app suggested that instead of a Hershey bar that I have a banana. What PMSing girl wants that?"
1064,1064,5,2012-01-11T19:20:13.000Z,mikemoto67,Makes food shopping more fun!,Definitely a fun little trick to have in your back pocket while shopping. Really eye opening to see what you actually buy. Love the alternate suggestions given for each product and the ability to compare two products instantly. Lots of products already in there so you'll have a blast at your next trip to the grocery store!
1065,1065,5,2012-02-15T05:32:33.000Z,Buckeye776,Awesome App!,"If you're trying to eat healthier, this app us a must have. It helps explain many of those hard to pronounce ingredients and gives better alternatives when applicable."
1066,1066,5,2013-02-08T19:41:02.000Z,Sudoku...can't get enough,Amazing Resource!,"Love lots of features from the grading of foods (A-F), ability to scan barcode of food eaten, details for grading of food, percentage of minimally processed, daily tips, and links to learn more bout food nutrition or harmful additives.  I use this app everyday!"
1067,1067,3,2013-08-29T02:20:17.000Z,Eshmomma,"Never, ever loads....so frustrating!!","When I first got this app, I was very happy. It's got great info and was exactly what I was looking for to help get my family's eating more on track. However, in the last two months I have been unsuccessful in getting the database to load so, I can actually use the app. I always want to blame my connection but when I'm using my own wifi and I'm not having issues with anything else, I have to wonder about the app."
1068,1068,5,2014-01-29T00:07:56.000Z,Tytytytytytytytu,I love this app so much,"Im not a dieter or fitness freak but I do try as hard as I can to eat non-GMO, non dyed, non processed, etc types of foods and this app helps SO much! A quick 2 second barcode scan and you know just about everything you need to and it's usually very accurate. Only thing I noticed was it said tap water is perfectly safe and I have to disagree with that, other than that amazing app"
1069,1069,5,2017-01-18T16:54:18.000Z,#1NavalAviator,Very helpful information,"Knowing what's actually in the food and drinks we consume is a nightmare... unless of course you go to the market and buy fresh actual food and prepare it yourself.  Or, unless you scan it into  Fooducate's data base and let them tell you. It's great to know what they think of a product. The facts are right in front of you.  They also have great recipes and a lot of other goodies."
1070,1070,5,2011-07-04T20:43:26.000Z,Alexa Vyain,Great app- in so many ways,"This app is not only helpful but very educational.. It doesn't just explain WHAT is bad for you/good for you, but also WHY. I love this app and use it all the time- my favorite part about introducing this app to friends is watching their response after they use it... It is important to understand why foods are good and bad for you and what alternatives there are out there. Thanks so much for making this app."
1071,1071,5,2011-09-08T05:48:03.000Z,Nettle spaghetti,My favorite app yet!,"This is the very best app! If you're trying to stay on track with Weight Watchers, and you want to feed your family healthier, and you want your whole family to have fun while trying to navigate food shelves then this app is for you. Super fast scanning of even obscure products. I kept trying to trick it and I couldn't get over it's accuracy. My whole family loves it."
1072,1072,5,2011-09-18T15:07:57.000Z,0062381,One of the most useful apps out there,"I have bought apps in the past that look good then never use them because they are not very useful.  Not this app!  It shows me everything I need to know before buying!  The best part is that if they don't have what you scanned in their database, you can take pictures of it to have it added.  Super easy, the app just walks you through it!  Genious app!!!ÓÄ¢ÓÄ¢ÓÄ¢ÓÄ¢ÓÄ¢"
1073,1073,5,2011-10-17T09:47:30.000Z,SuperSilver420,Love it!,"This is by far my new favorite app! It's so easy to use and convenient and has so many different products in the database.  If you are looking to maintain a healthy diet then this app is your new best friend. Not only does it give each product a grade rating, but it also breaks down the important things you need to know like controversial ingredients and the existence of trace amounts of trans fat. Absolutely recommend this app!"
1074,1074,5,2012-02-25T00:27:49.000Z,AngelQ21,Great Nutritional Tool,"Fooducate is amazing, easy and fast at providing nutritional information on everyday items we hardly think of. I have been using it when I go grocery shopping and have been scanning food already in my refrigerator. Thanks to the  letter grading system, I have been apple to choose healthier food alternatives. Everyone should use this it really does help eat healthier and live healthier. : ]"
1075,1075,4,2012-11-06T21:37:55.000Z,Guds_pooh!,I love it!,I have now started trying to maintain healthy eating habits... I came to know about this app through my friend and I immediately downloaded it...
1076,1076,5,2014-09-11T10:54:55.000Z,Roberto9006,Best app ever!!,"I never write reviews, but I had to let everyone know how good this app is. It alerts you when you are close to a supermarket so that you buy healthy stuff, but the thing I like the most from it is that not only do you get ratings and advise from the fooducate professional team, you can also see what users think about the product which is very helpful."
1077,1077,5,2015-03-31T04:05:21.000Z,DrSak,Awesome!,"It's really neat to be able to visualize what I'm putting into my body. I assumed I was eating fairly healthy, but it turns out I have some opportunity for improvement. The scanner is convenient although it would be nice to have some quick fresh meal options already stenciled out so you don't have to add each component of a fresh dish individually. Overall I think this app is a must have."
1078,1078,5,2015-11-15T03:15:51.000Z,Tech fan 951,Wonderful app,I have been using my Fitness Pal for years. I liked the app for tracking food intake and exercise but it doesn't educate you like this app. I prefer the letter grade for each item I eat and the reasoning behind the grade. It also provides alternative choices as well.
1079,1079,5,2016-09-12T19:50:48.000Z,BillyBobOhYeah,Even better than my fitness pal,"I have used my fitness pal for years. I have always loved it, but needed a change to jump start my fitness goals. I tried several different apps but none compared to MFP. That is until now. I love this one even more. It's not just a tracker, but it really is an educator. It provides useful and thought provoking insight to really teach you how to live healthier. 5 stars!!"
1080,1080,5,2011-07-26T15:51:15.000Z,Pfeiferjd12,Amazing!!,"I'm currently working on getting my Ph.D. In Nutrition and I use this everyday due it it's amazing and CORRECT information. I use this everyday, not because I'm a shopping mom who wants to buy better for her family, but because I am a college guy that is staying away from any kind of weight gain and also want to stay healthy. It's fun to use on stuff that you're curious is actually as healthy as the box says it is. GREAT APP!!! Get it!!!!!"
1081,1081,5,2011-12-15T13:57:33.000Z,Wspell,Invaluable tool! Get this one.,If you are interested in what you put into your body! This app is an invaluable tool!  I appreciate the instant letter grades given to rate an item- especially when I'm shopping.  I like the in-depth details on content- and the ability to compare similar products.
1082,1082,5,2012-03-31T22:02:39.000Z,nemo y,My favorite app!,"I love this app. Fast and reliable, it helps me choose the best possible foods for my family - older parents as well as kids. I love the comparison and alternative options features, especially when it shows the best alternative option for a sweetened drink is really just a glass of water!  Yes, this changed my daughter's decision about what to get!  Highly recommend this app to all my friends."
1083,1083,5,2013-06-15T16:31:53.000Z,Mysie7,Fooducate rocks!!,When you're stumbling through the grocery store aisle looking at 8 different brands of a product all claiming to be the greatest (and some with some unknown ingredients) it can be extremely frustrating. The sense of empowerment with the touch-of-a-finger advice that fooducate provides cannot be put in words. It's easy to use and informative and best of all...it provides you with better alternatives! Love it! Love it! Love it!
1084,1084,4,2013-06-26T11:52:51.000Z,Chajk,Best app ever!,"I just started the Whole healthy thing two days ago and this app has been very helpful. I'm skinny but I LOVE to eat which can be a problem in my family. This app has helped me realize that I can't just eat everything and then some. What I like about this app is even though I'm not trying to lose weight, it recommends me healthier alternatives. My ONLY PROBLEM: it freezes up sometimes which can be REALLY annoying but overall it's a great app. üòäüòÄ"
1085,1085,4,2014-07-30T15:23:17.000Z,CoolCat2348,What an eye opener!,I have been learning over the last few years about the harmful additives in our currant mainstream diet. However it has been hard to remember all the information necessary to help make heathy choices. Fooducate dies a great job off helping me keep my eye on what is good and bad choices and keeping well informed on how to choose a heathy alternatives. I have even learned about some heathy foods I never heard of before. I buy nothing new without checking with Fooducate.
1086,1086,4,2014-08-04T05:05:40.000Z,REALLYimportantDUDE,Really good App!! BUT......,"I really love everything about this app... The layout , the features, everything!"
1087,1087,5,2015-02-11T14:54:35.000Z,SueBig,Best of its kind,I LOVE this app.  It gives you realistic alternatives to the foods that you like to eat but aren't good for you.  If you want a burger it doesn't say eat a carrot instead.  I use this app everyday and it really helps me make better choices about my food.  I wish they had more fast-food info on here as I travel a lot and sometimes have no choice but to eat airport food for days.
1088,1088,5,2015-05-27T15:36:57.000Z,Laurcatrilez,Learning so much!,"Downloaded this app 3 days ago, and it's already my favorite. The scanning feature is the absolute best. Just when you think about cheating on your clean eating/real food lifestyle, you scan something that is graded as a D+. If reading about additives and chemicals doesn't motivate you to choose a healthier choice, not sure anything will. Such a great tool for guiding a healthy & smart lifestyle."
1089,1089,4,2015-10-08T01:39:57.000Z,Sarahbear224,Very well done,"I have been using this app for about a week now, and I appreciate how clean and simple the user interface is, while maintaining its utility. I appreciate being able to track the overall nutrition and health of my food choices, to attempt to live a more healthy lifestyle, rather than just counting calories."
1090,1090,5,2011-04-19T00:44:03.000Z,LLKmusiclover,Great app,"And the other reviewers have valid points about the database, but the only way to make this better is to send them updates. It's extremely easy and thus far I've had no problems. You might get an email saying they're swamped but at least they respond, which is more than I can say for other apps. I am absolutely loving this app and I think you will too."
1091,1091,4,2012-12-18T21:00:38.000Z,Zerothepielover,Excellent app.,"I have to say that Fooducate is very beneficial for whoever wants to eat healthier of for whoever is simply curious about what they're putting in their body. I rate the whole concept and options five stars. As for the phone application's scanner...  when I'm in a store, it may not recognize products well until I restart the app or wait for some time. All in all though, it makes a real impact and I recommend Fooducate to any customer shopping in a supermarket."
1092,1092,5,2013-05-13T09:48:25.000Z,mama2chloe,Holy Grail,"I loved this app before the update. Since then it had become my fave! Not only can I see what is healthy, it tells my if the food might have GMOs, tells my how many calories, carbs or whatever I'm getting and tracks it for me! This app really couldn't be any better. My only minor suggestion for improvement is to actuate the flash in low light for scanning. Other than that, nice work!"
1093,1093,5,2013-06-18T06:21:41.000Z,Taylor3321,Amazing,"I thought I ate healthy before, I always check labels, but with all the Gmo in foods it's very hard to know what's in a product. The fact that I can simply scan a barcode and get told of any harmful ingredients, is life changing. I had no idea how horribly wide spread Gmo was, and the fact that any convince/fast food restaurant (like subway and panera) all use Gmo. I use this App everyday, and I'm very happy that I stumbled upon it."
1094,1094,5,2013-06-26T18:15:45.000Z,#1zepfan,Great App!!!,I love this app so far.  It makes tracking your dietary choices and goals so easy.
1095,1095,5,2013-07-06T21:13:59.000Z,Fracolon,Wonderful,Finally a tool that I can use to track the ingredients of the food that I am eating.  Before I buy I could scan and review the product before committing to the product and then regretting what I bought.  I can create a grocery list That I can share with others.
1096,1096,3,2013-07-21T22:06:51.000Z,Jessica Buttrey,"Great info, could use some more","If you want to know the skinny on any pre-packaged food, Fooducate is the app for that. TONS of info; you might even learn a thing or two. But here's where I have a problem: if your goal is healthier eating, and you want to keep track of that, it's dang near impossible to use the tracking feature with fresh, unprocessed foods (which, again, fits into that whole ""healthier eating"" thing). I wish I could meld this with another app, My Fitness Pal, to get the complete picture of what I eat."
1097,1097,4,2014-01-19T16:47:09.000Z,FemForLife,Pretty good app,"Overall, this app works really well. Sometimes the calorie and nutritional info in the app doesn't match that of the product, but it's not off by too much. I'd like to see the exercises explained as I'm not always sure what to choose, i.e. What's the  difference between ""biking to work"" and ""cycling""? How vigorous is ""vigorous walking"" compared to ""moderate walking""?"
1098,1098,4,2014-02-17T16:59:17.000Z,Makingmindsandmemories,"Good app, needs more info","This is a great app for calorie counting, but could be improved for nutrition tracking. Much of the info is ""user added"" & is therefore missing a lot of information. I've also been prompted numerous times to add my own info."
1099,1099,4,2017-03-19T16:49:07.000Z,Hfitnich,"Easy, accurate, gives alternatives",I've used several apps over my 2yr loss of 80lbs and this is my favorite.  I like that it gives options / alternatives and that I can bundle items to make a 'meal' and then re-use that meal and/or edit it.  Only using missing from perfect is having a Glance on my watch showing my daily total and from where I could add those standard meals or my food items.  That'd make it 5star perfect.
1100,1100,5,2011-07-11T21:23:37.000Z,Barb_o,I love this app,I have not stopped scanning items in my house. I scanned an item not in their database and it asked me to help by taking photos and sending them along to them. I am on WW and it also gives you the point values. The only thing this app doesn't do is cook for me! I have an IPod touch so I cannot scan in the store but I know what I am buying so I search by item name before I go shopping. Live it!!
1101,1101,4,2011-08-31T22:35:35.000Z,tj&ed,Fooducate,"This is one of my favorite apps! I love using it while grocery shopping- it is very helpful when comparing products. The only negative is there seem to be duplicate entries with slightly different information and/or grades, and some entries only come up when searched by keyword instead of scanned barcode. Cleaning up the database would probably take care of that, though. The product alternatives list could use a little work as well."
1102,1102,4,2011-11-19T17:02:48.000Z,MissGulia,"Great tool, but imperfect","I like using this app when I'm trying to specifically decide between two similar products--in that capacity, it's helpful. However, the database is somewhat limited and the grading system is at times unnecessarily harsh (and unhelpfully so--it can make it seem like NO food is a healthy option, when all I want to know is THE healthiest option). Still, I turn to this app on a daily basis, and I find it to be overall worth the money."
1103,1103,5,2012-02-02T14:42:45.000Z,Rkuehl,Incredible!,"Love this app!!!  Amazed at the things I think are healthy and find out they are not!  Especially kids snacks, I was convinced that goldfish cracker would be bad, when in fact they are better then the Annie's organic version I have been buying!  My quick grocery store runs have now taken twice as long because I'm so curious what the ""best"" brand is for everything I buy!"
1104,1104,5,2013-01-25T12:37:30.000Z,Katy teacher mom,Fantastic awesome app,"My sister in law told me about this app & I love it!  I've told so many people about it!  We have been more careful about the food we buy & been shocked at how things we thought were healthy but really weren't. Needless to say, my teenage son doesn't like this app b/c his favorite snacks are rated C or D!  Thank you.  Please expand your data base to include ethnic foods as well such as items found in Indian or Middle Eastern stores."
1105,1105,3,2014-11-28T23:00:02.000Z,Lovingtheiphone,Freezing ?,"I love this app, it is fantastic!  So the app is probably a 5 star.  But recently it has been freezing on me.  Some times it freezes when I want to scan something, then if I wait long enough it will eventually unfreeze on it's own.  But now it is frozen on a food result.  I scan scroll up and down on the food description, so the app itself is not frozen, However I can't use the controls on the top. So I am stuck inside this food, i can't get back to the home screen."
1106,1106,3,2015-01-07T22:29:06.000Z,Maggie3260,Frustrating,"App food list is not geared for the Northeast.  Lots of trouble finding local foods in grocery stores and restaurants, even tho they are major chains.  Did a search for filet mignon- which I enjoyed over two days- and search came up with DOG food!  What that has to do with a human dietary plan escapes me!  Support is VERY slow in making effective changes.  Do like the tip explanations they give, however.  Sorry I spent the money for the Pro package.  Still hoping, however, that things will get better."
1107,1107,5,2015-01-23T17:29:16.000Z,Nadineluv7,Awesome I love it! Very helpful!,I love this app. It helped me out a lot and gave me closure about a lot of the foods I've been eating what really shocked me was whole-grain bread. A lot of the stuff that you would think it's healthy but is most definitely not healthy for you. This app will stay with me! I recommend it to anybody that's trying to keep track and want to know the truth about what they're eating.
1108,1108,5,2016-01-10T03:38:12.000Z,iPod Toucher 2.1,Takes a lot of effort out of healthy eating,"With all the info out there about what is and isn't healthy it's easy to be inundated how many different things there are to remember: types of carbs, types of fats, processed, organic, hormone-free, sodium, nitrates, GMOs, vitamins, the list goes on. This app makes it so easy, just scan a food and see what's wrong with it! Saves me time at the store researching everything I buy."
1109,1109,5,2016-07-28T13:49:45.000Z,Kastikiesz,LOVE,This is such a great app. We use it when we go grocery shopping and it's really easy to stay in the A/B range when all you have to do is scan the barcode real quick.
1110,1110,5,2011-12-06T00:59:30.000Z,Emmmmmmnnnn,I am a dietitian,"This app is great to get people to start eating better. Yes foods with additives aren't on my top ten favorites but in reality as long as you're getting ample vitamins, minerals, low fat, low calorie, whole grains, etc. That's what should be top priority and this app does it. Plus for ppl wanting to know about GMO I have news for you non GMO is not guaranteed in anything in america anymore at all since insects go from crop farm with GMO crops and pollinate non GMO crops."

I love this App.  2012 has really been our year to get healthy, and the one thing that has help us the most is realizing we need educated on the food we eat.  Fooducate has help so much. I enjoy interacting in their contest too, it's fun, you should try it.  How are we doing with our New Years Education on Food??,  my husband has lost 27 lbs and I have lost 14 lbs.  Good luck everyone, and thank you, Fooducate."

I like that this app educates you on the ingredients in certain things and why to be concerned, even offers extra links if you want to learn more and some awesome alternatives. I could spend hours on this app especially because I know it is an investment in my health! A BIG thank you to the people who creates this wonderful app!!"
1113,1113,4,2014-02-13T15:35:22.000Z,Cato5212,Pretty good!,Solid App! I feel much more energetic than usual because of my diet choices. It is an excellent way to track what junk you are possibly putting into your mouth and to change your eating habits.

All food  nutrition values, exercise tracker with many choices (by the minute),   and added random nutrition related articles/ videos added daily, and goal setting/tracking keep me coming back daily!   I love the end of day summary! Keep adding the foods I send in! I üíú this ap!"
1116,1116,5,2015-02-20T16:13:40.000Z,Elyse Ann,Amazing!,"This app has everything you could ever want in dieting or learning to eat healthier...calories, nutrients, macros, points, scanning, vast list of products, exercise tracking, community support. And you can't beat the price!! Best diet app I've ever seen...even better than weight watchers, which I lost 30 lbs on. Fooducate takes it to the next level...excited to see the results!"
1117,1117,4,2015-06-24T16:48:52.000Z,Queen Bee Texas,App used with Apple Health Tracker,"I started out using the app in connection with the Heath app on my iPhone. I am doing my best to live healthier. I love that I can personalize my choices. I have always been frustrated by the ratios that diet plans give for carbs, protein etc. How to figure percentages were too complicated to track. But now with the pro version I see exactly what is going into my body through my choices. I love seeing the big picture of my health."

The fact that it gives you alternative, healthier options to any food is a great feature. I absolutely love this app, much more beneficial than other health apps out there."
1119,1119,5,2016-08-16T21:39:42.000Z,Camila(:,This is way better than myfitnesspal,"I appreciate this app way more because of the fact that it isn't bombarded with ads while you are tracking everything. It even provides you with healthier alternatives which is definitely amazing! The grade helps to show you where your food item ranges, more helpful than nutrition facts ever could."

I don't read food labels but I love the compare option. Soup v soup- cereal v cereal. And I disagree with the rating that says ""helping"" the app is worthless. They don't have a lot at food lion - but I took a picture of each item they didn't have yet and I was immediately emailed with an update. Great app!"

The barcode scan feature is practical and convenient--I literally use it every day!  And the informational basis for the grading system has the unique attributes of being both thorough yet concise.  I hope this app continues to be maintained and updated, because I don't know how I can go back to living without it!"
1122,1122,5,2013-02-28T16:22:41.000Z,luvdwiifit402,I LOVE IT !!,This is an EXCELLENT APP !!  I love the special features this has.. I love the fact that you can scan your product and if it gives it a low rating it will let you know of a more healthier product.. I also like how I don't feel like I need to join WeightWatchers to just find out my point value.. It's all right here in this APP.. I would HIGHLY recommend this APP to my family and friends..
1123,1123,5,2013-03-12T06:13:57.000Z,Sean Meier,Awesome!,"Constantly use this app to track my calories, carbs, servings, exercise, weight, water intake.. Literally everything! I also use it to scan everything at the grocery store before I buy it, in order to make sure that everything is GMO free, and to see any pros/cons about the food. Love this app! You can personalize it for your own food needs too! Legit, this thing is so awesome!"
1124,1124,5,2013-04-27T10:56:40.000Z,OAR1502,Love Love Love It!!!!!,By far the best weight management app I have ever come across.  It's so simple and the health tracker is absolutely amazing!!!  The grading scale they have developed for this program makes shopping easy and fun and it also takes the guess work out of what to eat.  It's not a chore to chart your meals or anything else....I actually look forward to charting meals.  I just wish I had this app a long time ago!!!!
1125,1125,4,2013-06-19T19:33:03.000Z,Ladylalalala,Not good for tracking what you eat...,Not good enough to track what you eat if you're on a weight loss journey BUT I do use it when I'm questioning quality of the processed food I'm buying. I like that I scan a product & then get suggestions of a better product. That's what I use this app for. I don't use it often but it is helpful when I do need it. I'd give this app 5 stars if the food consumption tracker was better & easier to use.
1126,1126,3,2014-01-02T17:11:37.000Z,Grantsam,Great concept,"I really like the concept of this app. The idea of giving foods a grade letter based on their nutritional value is awesome. And I love how alternative food choices are given. However, I'm really disappointed with the inconsistency of the grades. Foods will have different grades depending on whether I'm using my phone or my computer. A lot of times the current grade will differ from what reviewers have previously noted. I would love to use this as a resource but I'm just concerned that I'm not getting the correct information."
1127,1127,5,2014-01-22T20:59:08.000Z,Donald Ritcheson,Extremely useful,"I'm a college student trying to avoid her ""freshman 15"" and this app is perfect. I love the scanner which helps me to quickly log foods. I also love how easy it to adjust the servings and find foods. My one complaint would be into hard to find restaurant foods, but you can look up the nutritional information and find something close to it to log."
1128,1128,5,2014-04-27T18:07:31.000Z,Soulina,Great Tool!!,"At first, I kept getting frustrated with learning that my favorite snacks and condiments were grade C or lower, but then I adjusted a few things, based off of their alternative suggestions. My body feels much healthier and happier as a result!"
1129,1129,4,2014-04-28T19:23:06.000Z,SadieVo,My Grocery Store Companion,"This app helps me easily sift through lists of ingredients to ensure I'm making healthy choices at the grocery store. I'm always surprised when food that would seem healthy ends up with a ""D"" rating. With clever marketing schemes and loose standards on terms like ""natural"" or ""low fat"", Fooducate helps me to figure to decipher which foods are best for me. I recommend this app to all of my friends who are trying to make good decisions about their food choices."
1130,1130,5,2011-05-24T10:46:20.000Z,Two under two,Awesomeness!!!,"This rocks! I love how I can find healthier food choices when I buy processed foods. I just wish the developers could keep up with the plethora of food items people are sending, it seems to take a bit for your food item to show up if it wasn't in the database already. But I love the message center when it tells you your food has been added and the games!"

I scan everything I eat that has a barcode on it now! It's also super great at the grocery store when I'm deciding what to get and I could just scan to see if it's healthy. I also love I could keep track of my food in the health tracker. Really great app, highly recommend!"
1132,1132,1,2013-03-05T13:13:57.000Z,jpegjames1,Why do I need an account now?,"I loved this app and recommended it to a lot of people but in the recent upgrade, I have to create an account. I used to be able to save lists to my phone but I no longer have that option. I do not like creating an account for every app I download...it's just one more password to remember or get stolen. Facebook is an option, but I prefer not to use that either. It worked just fine storing the data locally, please give us that option back. In the mean time, if you don't want to create an account to just use an app, I suggest finding other app as I will be doing."

One oatmeal might get an A vs another that might get a C. Many factors determine a grade such as sugar, processing amount, controversial ingredients etc. I carry the fooducate app in the supermarket with me and I scan everything. My only concern is that not every item comes up. Other than that, this app ROCKS."
1134,1134,5,2013-10-10T22:22:16.000Z,Catoucate,Eye opening what's in food // grades!!,So surprised our sour cream was not so healthy. Most of our foods were but a few weren't! So impressed with alternative choices that were graded already!! So helpful in making decisions.!!! Very impressed that we can help update new products not already in memory base. Also the information details on ingredients ( mini nutrition class) is AWESOME. Well done bravo!!
1135,1135,5,2013-12-29T20:34:37.000Z,Yasef,The Best app in your smart Phone,Yes you may have many apps in your smart phone but this app only and the only one will help you to take care your health ...whenever I go shopping I use this app and I make sure others also use it remember you are what you eat ...
1136,1136,5,2014-11-13T08:43:00.000Z,Preggo!,Love this thing!!,It even offers alternatives to foods you're sketchy on. Very helpful while shopping as well to steer you away from guilt. It works quickly so you're not spending any more time than what it would take to check the ingredients. I use it not so much for weight loss but as a way to judge what kind of foods I'm bringing in to my household for my kids and I to consume.
1137,1137,5,2015-04-01T22:16:46.000Z,SeasideCowboy,Use this everyday!,"It started as a kind of homework assignment I had given myself, now I look forward to seeing what the grades will be and the quality of food I'm putting in my body. I'm down 41 lbs due tomorrow to being more aware of what is going into my body. If you're someone who wants to lose weight or just curious what you're eating....This is the app for you!"
1138,1138,5,2015-04-09T15:48:32.000Z,CBlatch,Full featured and user friendly,This app delivers on what most other nutrition apps promise but fall short of: it is an intuitive way to build a healthy lifestyle when it comes to diet.  The barcode scanning works like a dream and the additional information that the app gives on different foods helps build greater awareness of what one is really putting into one's body.
1139,1139,5,2016-10-06T14:34:59.000Z,Janetkona,Great program,I was encouraged to start this by a trainer. It tracks your food like weight watchers. And adds the burn from exercise! I think it needs a little instruction button to help people find their way. I had a hard time figuring out how to do updates on my weight( the only way I found was changing it on my profile). And how to add exercise ( not on the daily tracker)
1140,1140,5,2011-09-18T03:52:39.000Z,Tarajanine1302,Love love love fooducate,This is one of the best apps!! I use it all the time now when I go shopping and it helps me to learn about a product so easily it's a no brainer!!! I have made so many healthier choices because of this app. I used to think I was making good choices for my kids only to find out what really was behind clever food marketing!!! Everyone should get this app- and it's free!!!
1141,1141,4,2011-11-28T03:59:00.000Z,Penelope's mom,Helpful but have trouble taking pictures,"I really like this app, enough that I've submitted several items.  Or at least I've tried to but the pictures taken look nothing like the images I see when trying to take the picture. One of the problems have been been the image will rotate and enlarge so the label  expands beyond the edges of the picture.  Otherwise, I've found most foods in the db and it's been useful."
1142,1142,5,2012-01-15T01:07:07.000Z,Weight lifting log,Fooducate,"This app is awesome, especially since  it is free.  So easy to use, just scan the barcode from any package. It gives you the food point value, similar to weight watchers. It also gives you a grade of the product along with a better alternative.  If they don't recognize the item simply take some pictures and they will figure it for you."
1143,1143,5,2012-12-08T13:57:27.000Z,Peggywilkins,Valuable app,"As a new Vegan, this has become a vital app to see how we are doing with the products we stocked in the pantry.  The first time I opened it, I scanned everything in the fridge and cupboards.  Some successes some errors.  I am so focused on buying things without animal products, that in reading labels I am missing other unhealthy additions.  I like that I can easily add items they have missed."
1144,1144,5,2013-05-13T07:15:49.000Z,LoveMT,Great App,"This app is awesome! So often, I think I'm making a healthy food decision and it really isn't. This app REALLY helps with that. I love that it gives alternatives and explanations."

I'm a college student trying to avoid all highly processed foods - a seemingly impossible task with a small budget.. But Foodeducate has become my BEST FRIEND! I scan everything before I buy it! I've even recommended it to my family, and it has become a must-have shopping companion for them too! :D"
1146,1146,5,2014-01-02T15:37:35.000Z,Anamchara Monastery Abbess,Keeps shops honest!,I absolutely love this app! Having this had given me opportunities ta talk with store managers because they always want to know what i am doing scanning their food. This has opened up many doors of dialogue about the food they provide for me andy family!! Interesting how they are not quick to tell me how good a brand is anymore! Thank you so much for this tool!! Keep up the good work!!
1147,1147,4,2014-07-31T15:01:02.000Z,Natx23,I love this app but....,I really like this app for the simple fact that it shows you alternatives for the food that's not good for you and it's also shows you what the food is rated on a scale from A to D. Okay now the ONLY down fall is that it's doesn't have all the products on here that you'll looking for and very few of the information is incorrect if they make improvements it would make the app much better.
1148,1148,5,2015-04-03T14:09:53.000Z,plg112,Amazing App,This app is incredible. I would highly recommend it to people who suffer from allergies. I have peanut and tree nut allergies. This is the first weight loss/diet app that keeps me aware and up to date on these allergies.  Yes I had to pay for the added allergy feature but it's already worth every penny. It will seriously decrease the amount of time I'm spending at the grocery store reading labels.

The Fooducate team is very helpful if you need to ask a question. They will get right back to you promptly with an answer and an explanation. I will be looking forward to seeing the database grow to include more food items.
1151,1151,4,2012-01-20T06:31:46.000Z,Leo Thor,Very Useful and User Friendly App!,I've been using this app occasionally from time to time.      It gives a real good invaluable and impartial dietary review of packaged products.  It even provides alternatives to a product that you've scanned (competitors).
1152,1152,5,2012-09-02T23:47:36.000Z,Chris7653,Very helpful !,"This is a very  useful tool.  Our family has several people with allergies and health problems, this app. has helped me be aware of some of the hidden dangers that are in foods. I would like to see it expand, or have sister apps, that would help with ingredients that are found in cosmetics and hygiene products or have a app. that would help with the food in restaurants.  Great app. !"
1153,1153,5,2012-10-01T00:05:26.000Z,LiveWell247,Review of Fooducate,I downloaded the app to see what it was all about. I was pleasantly surprised. It really helps you become more aware and conscious of the food you eat and the choices you make concerning nutrition. I installed it on two other phones and my friends are impressed. They use it almost everyday. Looking forward to database updates as more products are included.
1154,1154,3,2013-07-01T16:44:55.000Z,Super unhappy fb user,Doesn't organize well,This app is great to really see if what you're ratings good for you or not but it fails to organize what you eat well. Normally breakfast lunch dinner snacks etc are separated but I find this to just have a long long list of what I ate. If I drank 8 cups of water it lists it individually created a king and unnecessary list.
1155,1155,5,2014-02-16T19:27:10.000Z,Lampchopp,Favorite App,"I use this app every time I go grocery shopping! It's amazing the amount of food  I thought was healthy was in fact not. It gives you alternative healthier options to buy. Also, if you buy the premium version it will identify if an item is vegetarian or vegan! I highly recommend this app for anyone who is trying to live a healthier life style!"
1156,1156,5,2014-03-04T15:57:12.000Z,SlickRN,Love this app!,"I use the app every single day and love it!  I like the flexibility of tracking calories, points, or carbs, getting a nutritional breakdown at the end of the day, and a graph of your progress on key metrics.  My only suggestions for improvement would be standardized calories and nutrition for whole foods. I'd also like some additional metrics or space to add my own, like body fat percentage."
1157,1157,1,2014-07-20T11:08:42.000Z,Neveblu,Need major improvements,"In the beginning I really liked this app, but over time I've found not to trust it as much. Just a couple of things I find VERY annoying are when inside any supper market I'm lucky if I can get to scan one item after that I always get the same Time Out error message ( which I have sent in but have not received any feedback on)"
1158,1158,4,2015-06-01T18:15:58.000Z,Gymnaststew,"Busy working mother of 3, fitness enthusiast",This app does have its flaws but all in all I use it everyday for the great community of people with all one goal in mind. To be healthy. It's fun to talk to others and have health and fitness related discussions as well as discover new ideas of healthy meals from others. It's also has a great food scanning devise that tells you all about the food your putting in your body. Why it's good or bad.
1159,1159,5,2017-05-08T17:11:39.000Z,kelly saladbar,Great way to live a healthy life!,"I like to live my life not counting calories, but adding up all the fiber/protein/nutrients that I need to the day. I don't particularly need to lose weight, so I use this app as a way to choose healthy food options and keep record of the amount of natural nutrients/vitamins that are in the food I eat. I love that I can keep track of iron and calcium - the two that I am deficient in."
1160,1160,5,2011-06-06T02:17:34.000Z,AFUMAB,Love it!,"This is an app that I have used every single time I have gone to the grocery store!!!! It has been a real eye opener for many foods that I thought were ok. I also love that it has ""point values""! That has been extremely helpful! I have submitted a couple items that were not listed. I am very interested to see if these items will be listed at some point."
1161,1161,4,2011-12-31T06:24:07.000Z,fms821,A great App,"This app is awesome for all of its intuitive information, easy to use menu system and it's updatable library of info. Sync it to Facebook and teach your friends about what they eat and buy for their loves ones or kids. A must have app for any parent who has the time and money to really choose what's right for their kids. I'm even teaching my parents a couple things and getting them to buy better groceries."
1162,1162,5,2015-01-16T19:34:12.000Z,Theresa29,Love this app!,"I'm not very savvy on food ingredients, and this app really helps me discern between the good ingredients and the not-so-good ingredients. I love all the definitions of what the chemicals are and what they do in the food. It's starting to get a lot of users, so there's a wide variety of foods to get information on. The alternatives tab for finding better food options is great too! This is one of my fave apps."
1163,1163,5,2015-07-17T13:20:48.000Z,Not so grat,I can't believe it doesn't cost more,"I am considering upgrading to premium. The scanner is fast and addicting and I use. If your like me, you still buy some packaged foods and can't stand around in the grocery store reading every label and looking up every ingredient. This does the work for you and let's you learn later if you choose to do so."
1164,1164,4,2015-08-20T20:15:56.000Z,Kevn.Fsk,Perfect For Anybody,"I recommend the app to every one, it's Really nice and The Community on the App is surprisingly Active! You can track the food you eat and See how you have been doing with eating. It has a Fee for wanting to check other stuff like vitamins and other stuff but it's worth it! I don't have it because my Apple Account Pay doesn't work but if it did I would 100% Buy the monthly Prescription!"

Getting real facts about the food we eat is invaluable. We regularly use this app to explain basic healthy eating habits to our kids, and it adds a level of validity to our advice. I definitely recommend it."
1167,1167,5,2016-09-01T14:12:29.000Z,Salleeob,Just what I needed,"This is a wonderful app. It has all the elements I need to take control of my eating and my weight. Not only does it count calories and exercise throughout the day, It rates food from A to D so that I can tell if the food is a good choice. It also explains the rating and offers better choices. It has a robust community and many other features."
1168,1168,5,2017-03-07T01:08:19.000Z,April1187,Healthy Decision Making,This app is not only good for losing weight. It also is great for taking to the store and helping you grocery shop. You'd be amazed the things that are marketed as healthy actually don't have a great grade. I love that I can let it calculate points or it can count my calories for me. Everyday they seem to be adding more and more to their database. This app will not disappoint.
1169,1169,5,2017-03-29T00:51:23.000Z,MLT20,Enlightening,"This app has really educated me and opened my eyes to see what I am eating and feeding my family. I love the explanations of the grade. Very helpful in understanding the ingredients that are bad for you so you can look out for them in other places. One suggestion I would make is a ""where to buy"" feature for the top graded products or alternative products listed."
1170,1170,5,2010-11-07T13:35:24.000Z,Xzr,This app is awesome!,"Wow! It's super easy to use, and it gives you such great info! I try to read the ingredient lists, but it gets very confusing and frustrating at times. This app makes it so simple to stay on top of what's really in the foods that we buy. This is a great tool especially since I have kids and I want to know what I am giving them!! Thank you for this free app!"
1171,1171,5,2011-08-21T17:46:03.000Z,SAHMofboy,"Informative, a bit scary","A friend recommended this app but never really used it.  We went through her pantry scanning items and were surprised by the information provided.  I had no idea how much sugar and preservatives were in foods.  I continue to use it to help me make better decisions.  My most surprising scan: frozen fruit bars, even the 'good' ones have +5 teaspoons of sugar!"

Kidding aside, I think this I a great app. I wish the information supplied by this app was more sought after by our nutritionally imbalanced population. The app contains lots of nutrition info, articles, and suggestions for more nutritional options.  Super easy to photo and submit, if the product you scanned isn't their database. Thanks for a useful app."
1173,1173,5,2011-10-03T17:14:09.000Z,Barefootmama,Amazing,We love this app because it makes it so much easier to make informed choices even while you shop. And it helps sift through all the marketing that promises a great product and helps you find the one that truly delivers. Great way to put the power back into the hands of the consumer. Thank you for making this app available for all people!
1174,1174,4,2012-04-07T04:19:57.000Z,HCinIA,Good info but not well integrated,"I like this app. It helps to quickly scan for numbers (sodium content) and ingredients I might miss.  However it feels like there are two sets of info by different authors. I've found multiple products with grades of A- or B -- pretty good of any scale -- but that when you read the description of the ingredients a clear recommendation is made to 'put it back'. If that rec is there, shouldn't the grade be lower?"
1175,1175,3,2012-04-24T05:34:43.000Z,Socally,Almost amazing...,"I heard about this app from The Splendid Table and downloaded it. When I explored it at home, I was so excited to try it out in the real world. Unfortunately for my sad iPod touch, this app 1. Makes those without fancy phones manually add the barcode and 2. Requires the 15 of us who don't use their non-apple phone for Internet to have Internet to use fully while at the store. I'm disappointed I can only use this app at wifi equipped stores or at home (which defeats the purpose...)."
1176,1176,5,2012-10-16T19:18:50.000Z,Leedaneus,A must have app,"Weather you're a health nut or not this app is a must. I was never a food advocate and just ate whatever my taste buds craved. With this app, fooducate defined ingredients and word it in a way where I can understand what I was really consuming. This made me rethink the things I eat for the better not only for myself but also for my family. Easy to use app as well!! Thank you fooducate!!"
1177,1177,5,2013-03-27T03:20:50.000Z,W00t @_@,"Clear, quick food evaluator","I know the details are important, but the quick grading this app provides really helps speed up shopping when you must navigate a supermarket because the local co-op is closed.  It even helped reduce snack arguments with my son. Scanned some puffs, shows a D-. Pretty clear to everyone. I didn't say a word, he put it back on the shelf."
1178,1178,5,2013-04-07T04:39:15.000Z,sandra fan,Wow! What an amazing app! They have everything!,I am in awe of the people who developed this app. Amazing! You found every food item and analyzed it. I think I'm pretty savvy when it comes to suspicious ingredients but food companies have gotten so sneaky that anyone can be fooled. And who can everyday people rely on to tell them what's good and what's not? This app is it! Thank you thank you thank you!!
1179,1179,1,2014-03-17T02:25:05.000Z,itmsol-muse,Very limited database of foods,"While the app has the capability to provide a lot of information, it falls short due to the very limited and frequently inaccurate database.  For example, a boiled egg has anywhere from 0-160 calories. The location feature is great. But the grading system is far more subjective than objective. The articles are simply a facade for advertising which I thought my $9.99 got rid of. The biggest real pet peeve I have is that the predictive spelling is disabled. If the developers can get the database up to par with my fitness pal and get rid of all advertising, I'll gladly give them more stars."
1180,1180,5,2011-09-26T22:34:51.000Z,MalcolmEG,Totally user friendly,"Fooducate is an extraordinary app that not only allows you to make educated decisions on food choices, but offers alternatives to your favorites. The interactivity is one of my favorite features. Compare your food favs to other products, help the app grow by simply sending in a photo by email, and even enter to win prizes while doing so. Definitely 5 stars."
1181,1181,5,2013-06-13T19:19:52.000Z,Allierose2,:-),"Love this app. Was looking for a food tracker, I like the scanning capabilities and that they provide healthier alternatives. Also TONS of information about your foods if you want to dig in and read about ingredients, preservatives, Gmo etc. I'm a big fan. Hard to use when going out for a meal because it pretty much only works if you itemize the ingredients. But the educational material is really great!"
1182,1182,5,2013-08-29T18:22:24.000Z,davidt100,A must have app!!!,"using this app, I have learned so much about what I am eating.  The information is so easy to understand and the way the app is built u get basic information instantly upon scanning a product and then u can dive down more layers to get as much info as you want.  If I could only have 5 apps on my phone this would be one of them!"
1183,1183,4,2014-01-19T20:18:28.000Z,marinefish1,Pretty good,"What I like about this app is that it gives you alternative foods to eat instead of the usual junk. It keep tracks of calories, ""food points"", and all foods are graded. I would give it 5 stars if it had accurate information. Some of the foods that I've tracked are off by 30-40 calories, and for those of us that are trying to lose weight every calorie counts. But overall it's a decent app."
1184,1184,5,2014-09-28T03:21:16.000Z,EST_1994,Best food app!,"This is the best app I have ever had. I have not dropped a penny on any in app purchases but I paid $10 for this one back in January, best $10 I've ever spent! Everyone that knows me knows fooducate. It's really a great wholesome app that is all about your nutrition rather than your dollar. I would probably cry if they got rid of it. I'm a little too dependent. And I'm okay with that."
1185,1185,5,2015-03-06T11:19:14.000Z,Redklee,Useful app,I've used this app from the beginning when it was just a free app. When the premium became available I got that right away. Currently I'm tracking my food intake for cholesterol purposes. My health coach wants numbers that I can easily give her. üòä all I have to do is enter what I consume. Thanks so much for such a great app!
1186,1186,5,2016-08-05T03:09:13.000Z,Pinning all day!,For the most part super accurate,"I was going to give it a 4 but I decided to give it a 5 because it really does educate. For someone who really needs to lose weight, it shows you cannot touch anything that's processed which is the goal! There have been slight errors but always corrected when I look back."
1187,1187,5,2016-09-17T00:04:04.000Z,Jmbk1965,Amazing app,I absolutely love this app. I love that I can compare products in the store by scanning their barcodes to see their health grade. I also love that it gives me alternative products that may be healthier for me. It explains why the product is graded as it is and it also gives me the diet points for each serving which is truly helpful for those of us counting them.
1188,1188,5,2016-12-13T19:09:58.000Z,Jps4232,Awesome and easy to use!,"I love this app! Whether you're trying to lose weight or just eat healthier, you'll find a TON of helpful info in here. The tracking is super fast and easy to use as well. There have been products I've had to add (mostly local food store's items), and the support team is lightning fast at adding them in for me! Love this app!!"
1189,1189,5,2017-05-28T19:02:46.000Z,Sammytay0,Very Helpful,"I have been trying to loose some weight for the summer and this is the perfect app to track it. Unlike some people, I really like to track my calories; this app makes that really easy. Its interface is easy to use also! I would highly suggest this to anyone who either wants to lose weight or just eat healthier!"
1190,1190,5,2011-07-02T05:50:16.000Z,MikhailBower,Good if you have an iPhone,"I have an iPod touch 4g and the scan functionality just does not work. No matter how steady or how much light or how close/far away I am, it won't read the barcode. Thus I have to manually put in the numbers. This is because the iPod camera isn't auto focus capable. Still, the information given is great and recommend the app"
1191,1191,5,2011-07-16T05:04:45.000Z,JohnnyDuck311,Great,I just purchased my iPhone and just got this app but for now not looking what else is out there I do love this App I think it is a must for u who want to eat good . I usually always read labels but using this app speeds that process up a lot. Plus the comparing items feature is great. I would recommend this app for everyone... Thank I will add more after I use this more !!! An A+++
1192,1192,5,2011-12-05T18:47:46.000Z,Chantel802,Fooducate,"Love this app! It's fast, easy and direct. And if it doesn't recognize a product, it gives you the option of adding it which took less than 1 minute. Once i submitted the pictures, based on the picture I took of the ingredients, it gave me a rating even though the product wasn't in the system yet. Awesome for health conscious people."
1193,1193,5,2012-10-17T15:55:46.000Z,anderjaska4,Interesting!,"I enjoy using this app. It has helped me make a few positive diet choices. I really appreciate that it not only scores food but gives reasons. I have also been impressed with the extensive database for products, it is rare that I find something not scored.  Only down-side is the fact that so many products are just not very good for us."
1194,1194,5,2013-01-12T14:57:24.000Z,dacoty,Great App Overall,"This is a great app to help you make better eating choices. Easy to use too I like it and so far, this is the only diet/exercise app I use daily. I just wish the activity section had more depth to it exercise-wise ( i train martial arts and there is no choice to put that in)but for this app being free, that's a minor complaint. Everything else is spot on.  Great app!"
1195,1195,5,2013-02-17T13:50:50.000Z,PowergirlY,The most important app if you care about what you put inside,"I know it sounds cliche, but this app could change what you eat and therefore your life. It makes you aware what are you putting inside you and gives you better alternatives. It motivates me to eat right. There are so much more to this app .... I use it many times throughout a day. Get it!"
1196,1196,5,2014-04-03T16:50:57.000Z,JW57a,Wonderful App,"I love this app. I tend to have a narrow shopping list so many items are repeats that I have scanned and decided upon based on Fooducate's input. Whenever I am looking for something different or a special is offered , out comes the app to check it out. Also at home I sometimes scan items as we unpack the groceries if I was not the shopper."
1197,1197,5,2014-04-10T19:23:44.000Z,rachael623,Fooducate,"I really like this app!! The app lets you program your food in and lets you pick the serving size, unlike other apps were it does it for you incorrectly. There is a wide selection of exersices that you can choose!"
1198,1198,5,2014-06-27T14:16:04.000Z,Nj grl in FL,Awesome,This app is great! When you have something that is not in the system you can take pictures and write to the company and they get it on there for you. This has really helped me keep track and be responsible for what I eat. Way cheaper then other programs with monthly fee's. the best part it remind you to track. I love love love that part!
1199,1199,5,2016-03-18T20:46:23.000Z,IPod Touch 364g,Amazing!!!,I am so thankful for this app. It is the greatest. It makes my life easier when trying to shop for healthy food. It is easy to use and I like how it gives you alternative choices to not so healthy products. This has literally been what I been looking for in an app. My son actually introduced me to it. I am hooked on it. I can't be without it!!!
1200,1200,5,2011-07-20T03:13:57.000Z,NOSaints44,Very helpful and awesome,Wow! This app is amazing. I couldn't wait to start scanning items in my pantry. Very detailed.  The great thing is that if you have an item that they don't have on the database all you have to to is take the pictures and email it straight from the app. You get a reply quickly about the item. I'm telling all my friends about it. Awesome that it's free too!!!!! Love it.
1201,1201,5,2011-07-21T14:13:28.000Z,Makonadog,Changed the way we eat!,"Awesome! This made going to the grocery store with my 9 yr old a blast. He scans everything he likes and tries to avoid foods with a grade lower than a ""C"", by his own choice! It's makes eating healthy fun, educational, and easier. This app has had a healthier benefit to my family than any other app we've downloaded (out of over 200 apps we use!)"
1202,1202,5,2011-12-05T05:14:57.000Z,LovelyReverie,Cool,"It is a cool app that does what it says it does. It is fun scanning things in the store. I've even been surprised at the fact the it had some more obscure items documented. This is especially good for someone just starting out trying to eat healthy because in most cases it identifies ""fake"" healthy food- which may be alluring to people starting to pick healthier options."
1203,1203,4,2012-01-05T18:59:06.000Z,Bossiersmom,Good an useful app.,"I like this app, but when I'm standing in the grocery store trying to use it I sometimes feel a little overwhelmed. I try to make healthy choices but it's a bit time consuming to scan items before you buy them and even at home it makes me a little crazy because I never seem to pick the most healthy option. It's good but it takes a long time to use."
1204,1204,5,2012-10-18T11:22:26.000Z,Kj Kendo,I love this app!,I give it a 4 & 1/2 stars but I'll label this 5 stars simply because its a leader! Its designed in informing the consumer. Sign in and approve the option to inform you of Genetically Modified Products and your on your way to informative decisions. It's unbiased in its strict detail on products giving you the power live a more productive lifestyle. It's keeps a history of your scans too! Awesome app!
1205,1205,5,2012-10-30T02:11:18.000Z,Melissac301,Very helpful!,"This app is very helpful in making the right food choices. It tells you all the nutrition facts, as well as the positive and negative ingredients in each product. The only thing I didn't like about this app is that it did not have a few products I scanned. But for the most part, they have a majority of all the food listed."
1206,1206,3,2013-04-11T22:19:08.000Z,bee-bunny,Good nutritional info,"The scan aspect of the app is really effective and helpful for grading the healthiness of a particular food or drink. However, there are limited options when typing in an item to log and it doesn't allow you to customize your portion very well so it ends up being under or over what you actually consumed. Hopefully they'll work out those kinks with an updated version. Definitely great to use at the grocery store though!"
1207,1207,3,2014-05-19T13:22:42.000Z,Allisoncg,I want to love this app again...,"It worked great when it first came out but after an update the scanner would freeze my phone---in the middle of the grocery store so I couldn't use other apps for my grocery list and coupons! Frustrating! I don't even know what features are new, now only available if you upgrade or whatever, because I never use it...I'm afraid to! I still like to read fooducate articles on Facebook though."
1208,1208,5,2014-10-22T00:09:36.000Z,Brandon Hill,Just try it!,If you want to eat healthier or at least find out what you are eating try this app.
1209,1209,5,2017-03-07T21:43:30.000Z,Missmeeeeeee,Much better than my fitness pal!,I love that you can just scan the actual product you are eating and don't have to worry about searching for it! I pay for the extras and I love it! It helps to know exactly how much of everything I'm eating and I've lost 19 pounds in 2 months! Yay! Although I do wish there was a burn activity for core workouts or crunches.
1210,1210,5,2012-01-03T02:02:01.000Z,MorganPalmer,Love this!,"While shopping, labels can get confusing, reading 3 different brands, comparing each to find out which really has the lowest fat, salt and carb count. (as they all claim) With this app, I either scan quickly for the rating or choose the best one under the ""popular"" tab, then move on. It's made my trips so much quicker and less frustrating!"
1211,1211,4,2012-01-24T16:44:15.000Z,Surks,Great app,"I just started using it.  I like that it educates users about harmful additives in processed foods.  I also like that it suggests alternatives, so people can contemplate making healthy changes or look for those food in their supermarket.  I don't agree with some of the ratings for the fresh produce.  They rate organic produce higher, but it comes wrapped in plastic.  I always try to buy fresh and local and often go to farmers markets for the freshest produce."
1212,1212,5,2013-02-22T00:00:24.000Z,Donaldusmaximus,Love it !!.,"Love this app, very helpful in my diet. I'm kind of a data junky and the amount of data that this app provides and tracks is just the thing to keep me on track.  I've lost 5lbs already just by having the ability to make better choices. All it takes is a quick consult of the app and I'm on my way to better health. Love this thing !!!!."
1213,1213,5,2013-04-14T06:18:05.000Z,Lovelajolla,Excellent app!,"I really like this application. I was looking for something to help me make healthier diet choices versus just a calorie counter. I have learned so much from this app. I now consume many more tomatoes and tuna, I stay away from processes sandwich meat and certain breads. I always thought that I was eating healthy! Little did I know... This app has made a world of difference for me."
1214,1214,4,2013-06-24T19:41:40.000Z,Tyberius44,Great app- with a few flaws,"The app overall is extremely useful, but I sometimes find it hard to figure out why some foods are rated the way they are. The milk I drink is rated C+, although it is organic and lowfat. I'd like to be provided with more insight into the food grading process. Also, the place to enter your age has major flaws. Many months are gray and unable to be selected, as well as any year before 1995. Please fix."
1215,1215,1,2014-03-18T05:05:39.000Z,Ninnafaye,Food Search -You'll be there all day!,"THIS APP IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!! USE MY FITNESS PRO!!! While the graphics are pretty and it might be a tad more user friendly with the interface. This horrible app has a horrible search feature. Type in ""steak"" and every processed food shows up. I emailed with Lisa at Contact Us but she could not answer the simple question...Is the search feature going to be up graded..instead she gave me a list of commands to follow to get to STEAK. No I don't want steakums and every other processed food with the word steak. Save your money and use My Fitness Pro. I am going back there."
1216,1216,5,2014-05-18T21:10:07.000Z,Moosies Girl,Excellent,"I love this app. Easy to use, accurate, recognizes 85% of the foods I scan. The information is well presented, consistent and accurate. It supplies Weight Watcher points which really helps to stay on track and even tells you why the product earned it's rating, offers alternatives and other nutritional information. Try it. You'll love it"
1217,1217,5,2015-06-09T16:34:13.000Z,Hmsibby,Fantastic app,"I was looking for an app that would help me eat healthy and pick the right foods and I came across this one. I love being able to scan an item and get the nutritional info right away and keep on track with the food grading and carb, fat, and protein counts. I'm losing weight the right way with healthy eating and exercise. Just love, love, love it"
1218,1218,5,2016-04-14T01:43:43.000Z,Mstranges,Food grades are a nice feature.,"I've only been using it for a week, but I'd recommend it over my fitness pal. On the basis that it gives you advice on your food options and it lets you know if there are better options when you add foods to your health tracker. I use the food grading feature multiple times a day."
1219,1219,5,2017-04-27T13:23:07.000Z,Azz3879,Couldn't shop without it.,I know it sounds crazy but I spent 30 minutes in the grocery store one time comparing different peanut butters. Had I known about this app it would've taken about 30 seconds. I wouldn't and couldn't grocery shop without it now. I and my girl friend use it every time we grocery shop!
1220,1220,5,2011-04-18T04:26:42.000Z,Nadia_Ash,You better watch what you're eating Fooducate is in town,"I am so in love with this app, they have changed the way  I eat and buy food. They are honest and get straight to the point. I tend to watch what I eat if thier is an expert out there telling me the good and the bad. Last but not least their customer service is the best, the reply to your emails and your requests. Thanks Fooducate."
1221,1221,5,2011-07-08T20:34:07.000Z,Skygal0330,The BEST!,"This is one of favorite apps for nutrition information EVER! It's so much fun to scan when shopping - it really helps you make better decisions. (found out one of my favorites is rated a ""C"" - NOT good!) I scanned one item & it wasn't in their data base so the app asked me to scan the front of package, nutrition label, & ingredients. Then they sent me an email telling me they would add it asap. How cool is that?? LOVE it!!"
1222,1222,5,2011-12-22T15:24:46.000Z,Janj777,Great app. Needed app!!,"I have been using this app also to search products,  but a few Pictues show different products than what was searched for. For example,  Blue Bunny orangecicle bars show a big screen tv!!  And another blue bunny product shows Kirby product. Not foods,  looks like someone got some lines crossed!  Otherwise it is  perfect app for me. Love knowing what Not and what To eat. I"
1223,1223,5,2011-12-31T06:48:26.000Z,Tiffany(:,Awesome and so useful,"I actually have pulled this app up while in the grocery store to check the healthiness of certain foods. It's really useful and provides nicely presented and nicely organized info. which isn't a bore to read. Even though some products aren't listed, a VERY good amount is. Plus I love that healthier suggestions are often listed! :) very handy."
1224,1224,5,2012-03-24T02:09:01.000Z,eyeRN,Love this app,"This is an unbelievable healthy & helpful app. I've only begun to use it, but I've already changed the tea I drink to one healthier for me. I also learned some very useful information about other foods like honey. Get this one and use it, you won't regret it, in fact this is one you'll want to share with family and friends so you can be their hero."
1225,1225,5,2013-01-20T16:01:23.000Z,Dubonnet480,A must have to anyone wking out or whom has a family!,This app is simply amazing.

1227,1227,5,2013-04-09T23:07:45.000Z,Hsunami,Amazing for the health conscious!,"I have always read food labels and paid attention to ingredients and now fooducate has an extensive database that does that for me! Also since I started using it less than 2 weeks ago, they had added 3 foods that weren't in their database and analyzed them for me in a matters of 48 hours. Talk about an amazing idea and amazing execution. Bravo!!!!!!"
1228,1228,5,2013-05-15T16:27:11.000Z,Shawn McFarland,Amazing!,"Love this app!  Never realized how bad for you some things are that are labeled ""low fat"" or healthy.  One feature I really find helpful is how I can input my goals and when I scan a product it will tell me if the product falls in line with that goal. U also like the reminder it sends my phone using GPS when I am at the grocery!"
1229,1229,4,2015-01-19T17:15:16.000Z,Deemarie22,Use it almost everyday!,"I love this app and can't feel complete going to the grocery store without it! I love that it tracks GMO's now, although having to pay for it's a bummer. It's just missing one star because it'll rate things lower for having a higher food points value even when it's because of ""good fats"". It would be helpful if it pointed out and taught about the differences in the fats"
1230,1230,5,2011-07-25T14:56:47.000Z,ChefIRE,Great for everyone,"Everyone should have this app. I have a very extensive library of food knowledge, and yet this program is always teaching me lots of small things that overall help me make better decisions. Instant product contrast has never been available like this without years of tried experience. Who needs a mentor now?"
1231,1231,5,2011-07-31T00:56:24.000Z,connderosa,Great app!,"So far this app appears to be everything I had hoped it would be, which is something I can rarely say about apps. I'm a lifelong health nut and reliable information is very hard to find, especially when you're at the grocery store. Fooducate is well-designed, well-implemented, easy to use, and appears to be well-documented. Here's to your health!"
1232,1232,5,2012-05-06T16:28:20.000Z,kmarielittrell,Should be a Top 5 App!!,"This app is amazing. Not only is it easy to use but it's educational! I'm trying to be more healthy so when I'm in the store and want to buy something, I use this app to see how it rates. If I don't like the rating, it also gives me healthier alternatives to the food I'm choosing. Everyone should download this app. One of the best Free Apps I've downloaded."
1233,1233,4,2013-03-08T20:44:49.000Z,Zoe<3muziq,A great app for vegans,"I'm rating it a 4 because it doesn't ALWAYS have the food that you scan into it, but its getting more and more everyday from people that input the product. It's a great app for long time vegans and new ones because it will tell you clearly if the product is vegan, not vegan or seems to be vegan from looking at the ingredients. Also great for allergies and watching one's weight. A great app for a great price!"
1234,1234,5,2013-07-01T15:48:11.000Z,Stephi Zoe,So great!,"This app is awesome, the scanning feature is a great way to quickly add the food you ate instead of scrolling through all the similar products to find your exact brand. It is also so easy to add a product if they don't have it in the system yet and they are quick about putting it in! My new favorite app!"
1235,1235,5,2014-01-17T13:05:09.000Z,Lukie Pookie,The best!,"This is definitely the best calorie tracker I have ever used. Not only does this app count your calories and give you your recommended intake for your goals, but it also rates your food and provides better choices. Amazing! I've used this for about 4 months and it has helped me lose 20 lbs! The healthy way I might add!!"

Although Fooducate doesn't have a connection with weight watchers, they use ""food points"" which happen to correspond with weight watchers points. This app makes it very easy to see how processed foods are and gives alternatives. It is easy to use and the displays are attractive.  Love this app!!!"
1237,1237,5,2014-10-13T19:48:41.000Z,Bev Bishop,Best App Ever!!,I use this App several times daily.  I am very Gluten intolerant & it has been so useful to help me avoid Gluten in any foods I eat. I love using at the Grocery when shopping to shop wisely to avoid certain foods.
1238,1238,5,2016-05-05T05:49:49.000Z,Popsicle52,Awesome app,"Great for beginners, intermediate, and advanced people in the nutrition field. Though there may be some if's, I always get asked at the super market what I am doing by other shoppers, then explain to them how amazing this app is, and they go to download it. In short, if this app was $4.99 I would buy it. Only comment would be make a cleaner, simpler user interface."
1239,1239,5,2017-05-25T19:04:58.000Z,FaMoUs_Pres,Amazing,It's a great app dedicated to people usually you find apps mainly looking for money and not caring much about the users. This app isn't that way. They do have a premium but it's nothing that you have to or would feel obligated to buy. Only if your all that more into dieting then it'll be something you actually want to buy.
1240,1240,5,2011-10-11T11:58:32.000Z,VeggieNYC,What a fantastic little app!,"This app is tops when it comes to determining the healthiness of a food product! I love being able to see 'alternatives' to what I scanned, and see the grade range on the type of product, so I know whether it is healthy overall or just within it's class. This can help keep you on track to a healthier lifestyle!"
1241,1241,5,2011-10-22T12:51:46.000Z,Bea Starr,Good Stuff!,"This is a great app! If u want to know more about what your eating and what's really inside your food, then this app's for you! Ex. Tells u if what your eating is truly ""whole wheat"" you'll be surprised to know that a lot of products that claim to be 100% whole wheat are not! What's even better is that u get alternatives to that food that are what they say they are! ;)"
1242,1242,5,2012-02-11T11:13:24.000Z,Mesa Man,It's very useful!!,I find fuducate to be in line with everything I've studied and learned. I have also picked up a few things from it and it's very convenient to use. I use it everywhere I go. I'm also very active in sending them new information and additional information in updating their data base. Keep up the great work Fooducate!
1243,1243,5,2012-03-25T13:05:22.000Z,Phil the Bruins Fan,A real eye opener,Excellent app that helps you find information on food quickly! The letter grading system and useful information make it easy to see the truth about products that claim to be healthy! My kitchen may have less food now because of this app but it will be replenished with food that is better for my family.
1244,1244,5,2012-04-04T18:11:08.000Z,NotYappy,Helped me!!!,I have been battling my weight and no matter how many books I read my biggest challenge was what to buy and prepare for food. This app has allowed me to easily evaluate and compare the foods in the grocery store. I actually have hope that I can change my lifestyle and eat healthier. I can never thank you enough.
1245,1245,5,2012-04-07T18:45:59.000Z,Synergisticchic,Lifesaver for people with Allergies or Intolerances!!!!,Everyone should know what they are eating and feeding they're family! This app is a lifesaver for me! It's spot on with glutamate free/MSG info which is why they won't rate anything an A+. Unless you grow it yourself... You truly can't be sure what's in your food or how your body will react to it. At least that's how it is for me with Ulcerative Colitis. Love this app and the blogs!!!
1246,1246,4,2013-01-05T17:32:21.000Z,Dyllon Whitaker,Great app missing just a few things,"Awesome app , I love it and use it daly to check out the foods I consume and how healthy they really are . Only 1 downfall and me being picky is that on the self health tracker I would recommend adding the amount of fats and sodium and such you consume rather than overall calories and carbs ! But would recommend this to anyone starting or even expert people in fitness to check out !"
1247,1247,4,2013-02-04T01:13:41.000Z,bffanna,Fabulous!,"I really love this app because it not only tells you a letter grade for your food, it gives you alternatives as well. It's super easy to scan bar codes in!"
1248,1248,4,2013-02-08T12:25:02.000Z,etalber,Easy to use! Quick response by Development Team,"I have never been one to keep track of calories, but after my Beachbody coach challenged me I new that I needed an app that would be very easy to use. Well, I found it with this! This will be a 5 star app after some tweaks and adjustments for sure. The devo team here has been quick to respond on several occasions I sent info in to them. Thanks!"
1249,1249,4,2013-03-19T08:56:16.000Z,jsto,Healthy Motivator at your fingertips,I love this app... The best part is that it counts your calories for you when you scan the barcodes of the foods you eat:)
1250,1250,4,2011-09-01T10:31:07.000Z,Stark Raving Mad!,Very Cool,"This would be a five star review if foods had a glycemic index. I have used this many times at the market since I downloaded...people give me a pleasant, curious look when I'm scanning away. Knowledge is power with food! I've learned that ""healthy"" looking packaging may be deceiving. Definitely eating more whole foods as a result of this App. Let's face it, good health is priceless & proper nutrition is essential...step away from the junk food people !!ÓÅñ"
1251,1251,5,2012-05-10T06:44:22.000Z,MoeMoneyMan,Just a guy making changes to get healthy,"Great tool, but to really utilize it for the great tool it is, you really have to use it regularly. I don't agree with some of the grades, but they are close enough that I consider it more of a help than a hindrance. I highly recommend it for those that are serious about making a lifestyle change."
1252,1252,5,2012-10-18T01:24:42.000Z,Gizelle Anahi,I never shop without it!,This app is absolutely fantastic! I lead a very healthy lifestyle with lots of exercise and healthy eating but still I was eating things that I didn't know were bad or even illegal in other countries. Thanks to this app now I know! Even my husband got it on his phone and he usually isn't into scanning and measuring food.
1253,1253,5,2012-11-11T12:23:35.000Z,BubblySunflowers,Amazing app!,"I installed this app over a week ago because I decided to live a healthier lifestyle. I scanned nearly everything in my kitchen & found some disappointing foods that I thought were quite healthy. Overall, very informative & extremely useful for those of us who care what we put in our body."
1254,1254,5,2013-03-14T11:44:02.000Z,Plumasian,A+ app,My kids love using this app to grade their food! It helps them to know better what foods are good for them! We had a great time grading all the food in our house! We had mostly B- some C foods so now they are on a mission to chose only A's and B's!! What a fun and fantastic way to teach kids how to eat better!! Thank u for creating such an easy and wonderful tool!
1255,1255,5,2013-03-17T15:20:11.000Z,Siennabella1010,Fooducate,"I didn't know about this app until I saw my daughter playing around with almost all my pantry's products and she started to explain and now I got extremely worried about food containing GMOs, trans fat, too much sodium and too much sugar and food dyes. Now I don't buy a single product without using this app. It truly is amazing. I do recommend this!"
1256,1256,5,2013-07-04T10:45:50.000Z,Old minky,"Fantastic, but....","This would be beyond fantastic IF the site was up all the time. While frustrating to try and enter a food not yet in the data base , that is to be expected. What is frustrating and NOT expected is finding the site ""busy"" most of the time and thus finding it hard to enter foods and exercise. Bigger server please..."
1257,1257,5,2016-04-05T12:54:36.000Z,Ashleyeu88,Love!!!,"I love this app! I depend on this app while grocery shopping and it has allowed me to make better food choices. The only complain is, sometimes they don't have products listed.. Like when I'm"
1258,1258,5,2016-04-22T16:36:35.000Z,kbuech,Using the scanner to make choices at the grocery store is my favorite feature.,This app has exceeded our expectations. I downloaded it so that I could find out the level of added sugar in processed and other foods. It's done that in spades. I'm now recommending this app to most of my patients and have also to many of my friends.
1259,1259,5,2016-10-16T13:30:30.000Z,Vanderhelm,"Amazing app, everyone should use it!",I've used the website forever; the app is super helpful since you can scan the products' barcodes and get all the info you need.
1260,1260,5,2011-07-08T20:30:54.000Z,MacSteve,Fun and Enlightening,"This is such a nifty little app! It is very entertaining and informative. Foods I thought were good have too many additives and I am pleasantly surprised how nutritious other foods are that I used to not consider. It is helping my family make wiser choices at the grocery store. My wife and I scanned almost our entire pantry. I highly recommend this. Darn, my Cheezits ranked a C, but Cashews got a B+"
1261,1261,4,2011-09-03T00:08:22.000Z,Cjflee,New favorite app,"I've had an iPhone since they came our and this is the first review I've written. Great app and definitely something I will use (instead of download and forget like many other apps). Gave 4 instead of 5 stars because sometimes the comparisons see a little inconsistent on which product is ""better"". If you read food labels (or want to start), download this app now."
1262,1262,5,2011-10-17T22:00:54.000Z,iPod touch2023,No Freshman 15 for Me!,Fooducate is a great app to help you make better food choices in a split second. Being able to simply scan a barcode and immediately viewing the pros and cons of the food is both educational and helpful for everyday use and for future reference. This app is helping me to stay healthy while in college!
1263,1263,4,2011-11-04T20:13:56.000Z,BflyVi,Could be just a little better‚Ä¶,"The app is quick, provides great info, and I like the fact that I can see my list of favorites.  It would be even better if there was a shopping list integrated, or better still, a way to view things / export on a website.  I'd be willing to pay for those extra features."
1264,1264,5,2011-11-06T18:01:36.000Z,Sheridan14,Awesome!,"I <3 Fooducate!  However I wonder about their ratings. A regular Coke rates a D or D-, when I'd give it a F. I'd also like to see it offer a recommended replacement product (I use it in the grocery store and have to scan multiple products to find the best product). Overall a great resource and I look forward to the coming upgrades and improvements."
1265,1265,5,2011-11-15T23:51:51.000Z,aricbny,Too good to be true,"This is an app I always wish existed but never thought it would be possible to build. It recognizes every single food I scan, tells me everything about it, gives it a grade and tells me why it got the grade. I don't know how in the world it they did it, but I'm really glad someone did! I don't eat without it."
1266,1266,5,2012-01-19T01:20:53.000Z,EverythingsEventual,It's amazing...,...how many controversial additives are in our food. Packaging is just another form of marketing and doesn't give you an accurate description of what you're eating. Fooducate details the positives and negatives along with suggestions for better alternatives. This app changed the wag I eat and look at food. Paired with my fitness pal it's a great weight loss tool.
1267,1267,2,2015-03-14T01:26:01.000Z,MeghanAngier,No option for weight gain,"I need to gain weight. I have a hard time rendering to eat and an even harder time making sure I eat enough. I travel a lot and my schedule is intensely hectic so I need to eat whatever is available. I really wanted to use this app because it seems like it would provide great information for my lifestyle, but there was, sadly, no option for setting a goal weight higher than my current weight. Hopefully they can add that option so everyone can use it!"
1268,1268,5,2016-06-04T22:23:30.000Z,Teacher84,Best health app I've used!,"This app is better than any other health app I've used. It is thorough, accurate and very helpful. I've yet to have any issues and love all of the features you can choose from. If you are looking to really focus on your health, for whatever reason is unique to you, then I'd suggest this app over the others!"
1269,1269,5,2017-03-01T07:34:25.000Z,grimlight,"Great App, would like to see some changes","I really like this app, nothing negative to say about it.  What i would like is a different dashboard where I can update my weight and other metrics just as easily as entering food/daily diet instead of having to go through the side bar options. Outside of that, great app again!"
1270,1270,5,2011-07-15T19:47:35.000Z,JayWigley,Could revolutionize your shopping trips for groceries,"I find myself comparing EVERYTHING now with this simple, easy-to-scan tool in my hand. Sure, you can compare items by putting them side by side and reading the labels back and forth. . .but this tool makes it much faster and easier. And the price is perfect!"
1271,1271,5,2011-11-03T20:26:39.000Z,Tonnerre Salvador,"Nutritional info, additives, etc","I love the information added-- although most parts are generalized (if it has a specific artificial sweetener then the info given will be about artificial sweeteners in general). I love the alternatives, I like how i learned that food I once thought was junk food turned out to be healthy (popcorn) and drinks I thought was healthy was not (chocolate soy)."
1272,1272,5,2012-09-30T00:43:03.000Z,Mickey the Sorcerer,Fasted & Best App for Food Ratings,"This app is great.  I have taken it to Costco on several occasions and it identifies all scanned items.   My favorite part is the grading system it sets for the particular food you just scanned.   Of course, there is more information in the app about the food you just scanned."
1273,1273,5,2013-01-16T15:19:17.000Z,RiverStarJ,Male 55 yrs.,This App is Great!
1274,1274,5,2013-02-05T01:36:09.000Z,TurquoiseLove,Read this review & install this app :-),"Fooducate is everything I need to make better food buying decisions for myself and my family. I prefer to eat natural/organic proteins and whole organic fruit and veggies, but when making choices between processed food options - the fooducate app is a great tool to help select the lesser of the evils among processed foods. Enjoy!"
1275,1275,4,2013-03-10T17:51:45.000Z,Momomomomomoomg,Helps control my carb intake!!,"This is a great app that's really easy to use.  I like how you can monitor your calories or food points and also check your carb intake for the day. You don't have to worry about segregating breakfast, lunch or dinner which was always kind of a nuisance for me.  Also the options of better selections is great!!! I've had this app for almost a week and have gone down almost a belt loop!  Yay!!!!"
1276,1276,2,2014-02-17T17:28:04.000Z,ILuvFreeMusic,Bad since update :(,"I used to live this app but it does not work since I upgraded. For example, it constantly errors out due to no network/cellular connection but BOTH are available and I confirmed my settings are correct (not having problem with any other app). This alone makes it virtually unusable. Further the scanner doesn't work properly since I downloaded the newest version . Sooo disappointing esp because I wanted to get a premium account... Now I'm afraid to pay of the app is NOT GOING TO WORK."
1277,1277,4,2014-03-29T14:34:38.000Z,Udbrewer,I can do it! With help from Fooducate.,"Great app! It's an easy way to do something I never wanted to do before...track calories. I like having the 12 month premium version because I can track so many other things like fiber and protein intake. Love that I can input my energy expenditures too, be it exercise in a gym or cleaning house. Thanks, Fooducate! I'm excited to see my progress a month from now."
1278,1278,4,2014-04-16T18:03:42.000Z,3gsx,Very good but.....,"As others have said, it needs a larger database, it often doesn't recognize food she's scan. My other problem with this app is that it is not at all intuitive, you can use it for weeks and still have difficulty finding your way around and all the various features. That said, it has a lot of pluses, hence the four star rating."
1279,1279,5,2014-07-28T14:38:33.000Z,SJW123,AMAZING,Love love love this app. I take this to the store and scan things as I go. I really feel like I  learning something new about how to eat healthier all the time. Enjoy the emails they send as well. I plan to upgrade but there is so much even if you don't upgrade. Certainly worth downloading this app.  To whomever made this app. Thank you so much!!!
1280,1280,5,2011-01-25T01:14:39.000Z,Dynoman52,AMAZING !! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT !!,"I just installed this today and made use of it at two different stores. It was INCREDIBLY fast to scan on my iPhone 4 and 100% accurate on everything I tried it on. Even STORE brands were INSTANTLY recognized and graded.  This type of APP makes owning a SMART phone worthwhile,  It now lives on my home screen and I plan to use it whenever I shop. AND IT'S FREE !!!!"
1281,1281,5,2011-01-28T02:39:35.000Z,oliveracat,Top Notch even if it was a paid app,"I'm actually surprised this app is free (at least currently). It works nearly flawlessly (have had minor issues scanning in low light) and i'm impressed with the depth of the database. Keep up the great work and I will definitely spread the word on this one, it's important enough to move to page 1 of my apps."
1282,1282,5,2011-04-30T15:23:56.000Z,LisaAmmo,Awesome,"My favorite app yet!  I have made much wiser food choices using this, especially for my kids.  Amazing how many chemicals and how much trans fat is in our food.  I have people ask me what I am scanning at the store and once I show them, they immediately want this app too!  They have a huge list of products and the scanner works perfectly!"
1283,1283,5,2011-07-04T16:18:28.000Z,tinybirdedtwig,Keeps getting better,A good app overall. I wish that it would factor in if something is organic as part of the rating. Also wish there was faster turn around about products whose information you send in to find out about. But it's excellent and I use it every time I hit up the grocery store.
1284,1284,5,2013-01-21T20:13:39.000Z,JS5.5,100% necessary at the store!,I never shop without this. The ingredients lists these days read like science experiments! This app helps to understand the basics of nutrition and untangles the advertising mumbo jumbo so that consumers can make healthy decisions. Sometimes it's horrifying to see what is really in a product but I'd always rather know if I'm buying a chemical nightmare. Thanks Fooducate!!
1285,1285,5,2013-03-15T18:24:20.000Z,Ladi_nNY,Time saver,This makes life so much easier. In this journey to becoming healthy counting and keeping track of calories isn't easy. If I had to use pen and paper I dont think I would; I actually think I would give up. This is the best tool for keeping track. I know there are others like this but I'm stuck on this one!!!!
1286,1286,4,2013-11-15T13:25:35.000Z,Salonoutlook,Love this app.,"Especially while shopping, because it gives you better alternatives when scanning an item...thank you for this..."
1287,1287,5,2014-02-16T15:28:06.000Z,Thisnamebetterbeavailablexxyyz,Great little app!,I really like this app! I've been using it for a couple weeks and have already lost a few pounds! I wish more restaurant foods and foods in general were added in; some days 60% of my intake is unknown. But overall it's a great app to use if you're trying to lose weight or just eat healthier. I recommend it!
1288,1288,5,2014-04-03T19:16:55.000Z,D 1 Xfactor,Nathalie,This is a great app for counting your calories and keep a food log and knowing exactly what your eating. It even allows you to scan the barcodes on food packaging and tells you everything you need to know about that product. It even gives you info on fast food and restaurants. It's great!
1289,1289,5,2014-05-08T13:19:54.000Z,Melchka,Very good,Easy to use and a lot of fun features. Only thing that I would improve would be having the daily tracker be the home screen when you log in instead of going to the menu every time as clearly it is the most often used of the choices.
1290,1290,5,2011-06-27T18:48:23.000Z,Sammi JoJo,Best App Ever!!!,"I absolutely love this app! Especially because it explains the way different ingredients affect your body, healthwise. This, then, enables you to see why you should make healthier choices of food. And, it puts healthier choices right there for you. So excited about this & I hope many people will start using Fooducate & get healthier. I definitely rate it A+ or 5 Stars."
1291,1291,1,2011-09-22T08:02:47.000Z,1ndica420,Why does the app say compatible when it's not?,"After reading the description I finally found out why it wasn't working for my phone. The app itself does state that it works with IPhone 3G, but the app store states it does NOT. Kind of a bummer considering I don't want to manually input a 16 digit long number for info... This should be something that they make a littttttttle clearer. Good info overall just a major inconvenience for those of us who can't upgrade to the iPhone 8G or whatever it's at now. Maybe next year people will start dating them too."
1292,1292,4,2012-01-19T20:37:34.000Z,Sabrinas28,Awesome... When it's working which is usually,This app is fantastic. You go shopping. You scan the lunchables. You realize it's full of stuff you'd never feed your kids. You put it back and fix the real deal. My only gripe is that occasionally it says it's not connected to Internet which is impossible because I have wifi and a data plan. But it usually works anyways.
1293,1293,3,2012-04-02T19:44:00.000Z,sandely,Informative but slightly disappointing...,"My aunt got this on her Droid and found it interesting, I downloaded it on my 3rd gen iPod Touch and started playing with it, but soon found that the ""random"" feature does not work on an iPod without a camera.  Which I don't really understand.  It's a great app if you have something specific in mind that you want to research, but if you are looking for aimless education, then this app is less than desirable."
1294,1294,5,2012-07-02T04:11:35.000Z,Kay8701,Love it!,"So happy you fixed the error message so fast! It's super fun to scan all of my household items. Its super simple to use too!  I love the daily tips section, it has some really interesting articles. I also like how it saves your past scans. Looks like I need to start eating wayyyy healthier but I'm glad this app will help me with that. Thanks for the great app!"
1295,1295,5,2012-10-28T00:53:45.000Z,EducatedMom,Love this app,This app is an eye opener for me. I am learning that some of my favorite foods are not as healthy as I thought and by making simple changes I could live a healthier life. To those that say the app doesn't work- I rarely get that message and when I do it asks me to take a pic of the food do it can be added to the database. I love it. Cheers to eating better.
1296,1296,4,2012-12-19T06:29:33.000Z,Jackx36,Impressive,"This is exactly what I was always looking for. And since that whole ""right to know"" prop in California failed, this is exactly the perfect app to find out if products contain GMO's."
1297,1297,5,2013-01-04T18:30:07.000Z,Sharp mod,Fantastic app.,"I love this app! It gives great information on what you're eating, alternatives, and the addition of the tracker is great!"

Many items I thought were healthy are not or the amount of crap that is added to our food is crazy. Very informative app & it will help our family make wiser food choices.
1299,1299,5,2016-09-09T02:55:53.000Z,SpanishMaster5000,"Excellent, thorough, and helpful","This app has helped me keep track and summarize my daily caloric intake; additionally, and most importantly, it is constructive in its standard for quality food and has directed me away from food's I wouldn't have known were poor for my health. AND it's free. What. Thank you to those who put the time and effort behind this app."
1300,1300,5,2012-07-05T10:59:38.000Z,Dupe55,Great App,Make educated choices about the foods that you eat... Surprising how many product labels

It does make my trips to grocery store longer, but it is so cool to compare products side by side right there before buying. I love how it will give you a ""better"" choice for a product. Also it tells you why it gets the grade it gets like ""processed"" or"" not whole grain"".  I give the app A+"
1302,1302,4,2013-01-22T16:04:22.000Z,Chimofam,Great ap,"I love many things about this ap,it tracks my daily calories, helps me set goals, and keeps track of food points so I can monitor what I take in.   I also like that it always burn counts and allows for exercise.   My only request would be that I would like a tally of my protein count as well.  Being a vegetarian I need a reminder of where I stand and would like a running tally."
1303,1303,3,2013-04-12T16:22:44.000Z,4evrtokn,Pretty good app,"I really like the scan option on this app. It would be nice if you could view your nutrient chart any time instead of just at the end of the day. It would also be nice if the nutrient chart showed more of your nutritional intake...such as iron and all minerals, vitamins, calcium, fiber etc... The ability to add a product that the app doesn't have would also be a plus. Its the best one i have found although I haven't done much looking."
1304,1304,5,2013-05-06T14:55:12.000Z,Sbjabc,So helpful!,"I love this app! After I set up my goals and preferences I had fun scanning everything in my house to see how items measured up. There were a few surprises and helpful explanations along the way to assist me in making healthier choices next time. I had my boyfriend get it, so he feels more confident picking up items at the store. Love it!"
1305,1305,5,2014-02-20T03:35:07.000Z,imlynam,Ultimate Health App,"Fooducate is the ULTIMATE health app. You don't need to follow any particular diet. Simply scan EVERYTHING edible in your house. Anything that scores less than a C/C+, THROW IT OUT! All the nutritional value is listed there for you and it even suggests better alternatives for those low scoring foods you like to eat. Plus, they post daily articles that are good reads for health and nutrition. AWESOME APP!!! DOWNLOAD!!!"
1306,1306,5,2014-03-14T19:48:12.000Z,Abasinphq,I'm liking it so far!,"After I broke my back, I had put on a good chunk of weight from not being as active as I was before. I wanted to see what all I was eating and this really puts it in front of you. I'm amazed how looks can be deceiving on portion size. It's nice to scan or write the ingredients in and it keeps a record of everything."
1307,1307,4,2015-05-10T11:33:02.000Z,cuentanos,Free version good,"Like it & using it for over a year. Scan bar codes, find popular restaurants and grocers from thousands of foods and meals. Or photograph and submit your own recipes to keep track of daily calories. Then see them melt when you include exercise or physical activity of any kind. Get health tips in daily newsletter. Paid version includes much more specific to individual."
1308,1308,5,2015-07-30T14:06:25.000Z,Madycat116,Best food app ever!,"Fooducate is simple and easy to use. The barcode scanner works and the database of foods is very large. Also if you need help in your dieting process and need some idea of foods to eat, you can look at the recipe section to get some ideas. Overall I love this app I already have began a healthy life style with my eating."
1309,1309,5,2015-08-14T13:48:32.000Z,aychwayne,Educational and Useful,This is my second day using the app. So far I love it. It has handed me some surprises - and affected my snack and meal choices for the better. Sometimes I don't want to know everything about the ingredients in my snacks - or do I?  Now I am very interested. Love it - thank you to the creators. The barcode scanner works exceptionally well.
1310,1310,5,2011-12-02T18:10:52.000Z,ahaajulian,Great App! Very useful,"This app gives our family a good idea on what is good, bad or better for us when it comes to eating. My 12 yr old daughter has fun using it while we're grocery shopping & I feel like its also teaching her about good food habits in general. I love the alternatives it gives you as well. One of my favorite apps!"

This app not only helps with that but also tells you if the foods marked ""healthy"" actually are. It also explains why or why not. I've been using it frequently since I downloaded it and really like it."
1312,1312,4,2012-07-05T05:50:50.000Z,t_olaugh,Very informative,"I love to use this app when grocery shopping to get the better options even if I can't afford the majority of the  ""A"" graded products...so my only complaint is the grading system because I don't quite understand it. Other than that it's a great way to stay informed on what's in your favorite foods, why it's good or bad for you, and how to swap them out for healthier alternatives."
1313,1313,3,2013-11-04T16:13:23.000Z,Panitzshea,Needs a little help,"I love this App, I try to use it consistently to track how/what I'm putting into my body. Suggestion when you go to scan an item (say cranberry juice) and it gets a low rating (c-d) maybe suggest other types of cranberry  juices with a higher rating (A-B). Also your food library needs work, all fast food restaurant items should be on there already?...this will be huge if you take the guess work out of it."
1314,1314,4,2013-11-09T16:37:23.000Z,Beavery Chew,Great for Weight loss & maintaining,The points information that I get from this website is excellent. I can find things that r not on the Weight Watchers website. It is really well rounded with all foods good and bad. U need to know the good and the bad when u r trying to lose and maintain your weight. The only negative is it is sometimes hard to get the WW Points cause we do not count calories. Thank u Fooducate.
1315,1315,5,2014-05-16T12:20:39.000Z,Lovablell,Me,"I love this app! It's easy, hold me accountable and teaches me how to make healthier choices. BUT, best if all, it teaches my 11 year old son how to make healthier choices. Being graded every day is great for us. Who doesn't want to get an A. I've told all my closest family and friends about it, because we are what we eat, and I want them to be healthy!!"
1316,1316,5,2014-06-15T00:14:06.000Z,StearmanAirplane,Awesomeness!!,"I love this thing!  It was a real eye opener for me. Never realized how many calories I was actually consuming during the day. The feature I really like is what I call the calorie count down. Entering my food and seeing how many more calories I could still consume before hitting my daily goal, helped me lose 10 pounds in one minth."
1317,1317,5,2014-07-23T15:49:39.000Z,ADP0016,Extremely Helpful,"I don't typically rate apps but this one has worked better than all the other similar ones I've tried. Not only is it simple and easy to use, but also gives helpful information on why they give the rating for the food!"

You can look up foods, or scan them. & you can also add your ""quick calories"" this has helped me a lot to figure out what's actually healthy and what's not. I go through the store and scan it before I buy it! Awesome !!!"
1319,1319,5,2015-05-29T14:47:54.000Z,Fincher 13,Great app,I love to food grade and the healthier suggestions. It makes you look at what you can do better. Then you can track your exercise and they have so many options to choose from. If you want a high tech food journal this is perfect for you. I love it and have recommended it to many people.
1320,1320,5,2011-12-30T02:55:43.000Z,Allipanda,Love it!,"Does everything it promises!  It is so easy to find healthier alternatives to the food you normally eat.  I have already made a quick rule for my kids.  I told them we can't buy anything below a C, now there are no arguments when they don't get the junk food they want. We just scan it and they see the grade!"

1322,1322,5,2012-04-15T21:30:54.000Z,Sanibella,Most used,This is one of the most used apps on my phone.  East to use & a must have for anyone concerned about the health aspect of the food they eat. The added bonus is for anyone tracking point system diets the info for this is on here too without the extra cost for that feature.
1323,1323,5,2012-05-29T16:33:07.000Z,Toolz13,Didn't know all the junk I was eating!!,"The app is very eye opening! I considered a lot of the foods I ate to be healthy but found out I should really look past the ""healthy for you labels"" and see what is really in some stuff. I also like the healthier alternatives section! I just wish they listed where you could find them."
1324,1324,4,2012-09-25T21:02:37.000Z,Lezlib,Facebook connection,"I like the product, but I have one complaint. I signed in with my Facebook account and this app posted my scan of soup on my page. I checked,  And I had turned off the posting without my permission. It's not a big deal, but I don't necessarily want my friends to see my processed food choice. Now I can't get it off my page. Just a little annoyed."
1325,1325,5,2013-02-28T01:27:57.000Z,hellsbells603,"Excellent, eye opening app!","I absolutely LOVE this app. It's unbelievably eye opening. My husband and I are generally fit and strictly eat home made, healthy meals M-F. That being said, I used this app the last time we went food shopping and could not get over how much crap was in items I usually keep stocked! Packaging can be so misleading! Highly recommend."

It's so convenient and informative and some of the things I'm learning, although they may make my stomach turn, are going to leave a lasting impression on my diet! Amazing application! Definitely worth a download!"
1327,1327,5,2013-03-13T15:24:44.000Z,AnBnana,Awesome!!!,This app is very easy to use and so much better than keeping a food and exercise journal! I love that its customized to the specific user and tracks progress. I also received a VERY prompt response when contacting them with a question...I HIGHLY recommend this app! Really helps keep you on track for a healthy lifestyle!
1328,1328,5,2013-07-16T16:45:51.000Z,HayleyHoo15,Exceptional!,"I love this app so much! I never write reviews, but this app is so great that I am writing one for it! It's perfect for anyone who wants to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Or lose a little weight like me! :) The scanning feature makes it so much easier to count calories and look at nutritional values! I recommend this app to anyone who wants to easily stay in shape! :D <3"
1329,1329,5,2013-08-10T11:45:33.000Z,Lissars,Awesome app!,Only have been using it for a week and I have already lost two pounds. It takes the guesswork out of my food choices. I was surprised to learn some items I thought were healthy were actually bad.  I looooovvvvveeee the scan feature and the notification feature.
1330,1330,4,2011-07-04T16:59:19.000Z,Pixie1213,Healthy Food App,"This is a great tool for finding out the skinny about the foods you are thinking of putting into your body. It offers ""healthier"" alternatives, some better than others. The grading system sometimes seems a bit arbitrary and the comparisons occasionally don't offer an equivalent alternative, but overall, it is a handy app to have in the grocery store aisles."

Very informative and educating.  I learn lot thru this app.  Keep up the great work & continue to grow.  And thanks to all individual contributors.  Though many international barcodes do not work / scan properly, what is available are very enlightening!  Thank you!"

1333,1333,5,2015-01-02T16:36:30.000Z,DominatorIM,Great App,I find this easy to use and I am able to track my eating and exercise. As more foods are added this will be an even better healthy eating app. Also extremely helpful while shopping. Easy to scan products for nutrition value. I love this app and use it every day.

Very impressed."
1335,1335,5,2015-06-10T15:32:03.000Z,Asmall,"Amazing app, but would like offline mode","This app is perfect for calorie tracking to meet target goals, for the first time I'm actually able to keep count of what I'm eating every day. That being said, I'd really love to be able to add food from my recently added or user created folders when I'm offline"
1336,1336,5,2016-05-19T13:03:46.000Z,ChocolateLatte,Really great app,I really like this app because it makes me so much more aware of what I eat. It allows me to track what I'm eating and learn how healthy it is and why. It's better than apps that just let you keep a diary because it tells you what's healthy and what's not based off way more things than just calories.
1337,1337,5,2016-09-07T02:24:51.000Z,LattaK,Truly impressive app,"I have tried many food tracking apps and this one is by far the best.  I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about healthy eating, but the apps food rating system has led to make a few different choices.    The suggestions for alternatives to poorly rated foods is especially helpful."
1338,1338,4,2016-10-19T00:07:04.000Z,Huzebom,Helpful and intuitive,"I've used nearly every iteration of healthy eating app available and appreciate the depth of information I can get quickly and easily on this one. It's easy for me to track how I'm doing- get great ideas and recipes from the community and add recipes that I make on my own (including raw vegan). My only wish would be for suggested meal plans - yes, I can be that lazy."
1339,1339,5,2017-02-25T00:59:04.000Z,San Francisco gal,Excellent!,"While I dont use the app to track daily calories (choosing instead to focus on micro-rich nutrients) I regularly rely upon the Food Finder which, with few exceptions, accurately grades food products. I have also joined the Fooducate Community, which I absolutely love! Having tried other similar apps, I consider ""Fooducate"" to be best in class."
1340,1340,4,2011-08-22T02:36:49.000Z,Marilu23,Fooducate- great application,"Now you can know better what you are eating, and you will get surprised! You can find most of the products at the grocery store and get the nutrition score. For those who really care of what they are eating, it gives you healthier alternatives. There some products missing though, but you can help out by taking pics of the package and nutrional info."
1341,1341,5,2011-09-07T06:15:31.000Z,Z-Dubbs,Awesome app!,"This is a very useful app.  I am seriously impressed with their current database of items and look forward to more being added! I also love the fact that new items can be sent through the app to be rated in the near future, quickly and easily with pics."

I consider myself knowledgeable about healthy eating but I'm surprised at the grades sometimes, so I'm learning a lot. I wish there was a way for it to use your location to determine which stores are available to you so the suggested alternatives were more appropriate."
1343,1343,4,2012-01-09T18:05:56.000Z,Dr.SWBoyles,Great app with limitations,"I do like this application, I have learned a lot about the food I like to eat and what I should be buying.. However, my town does not carry all of the ""A-B"" products and it's hard to buy the ""better"" food item you need. I wish there was a grocery store you could choose from so the app would know what products your store should only have."
1344,1344,3,2012-01-11T06:55:17.000Z,bniemyjski,Like it but needs usability improvements,I really like this app but it gets annoying when adding things to a list causes a prompt every time.
1345,1345,5,2012-03-28T15:16:31.000Z,Kcj3745,Transformative App!,This application has changed how I grocery shop. This is the first truly impressive app I have ever downloaded. I highly recommend it because it brings ingredients and nutritional content to your attention in a different way and helps you sift through all the mixed messages in current food packaging.
1346,1346,5,2012-08-28T02:58:49.000Z,Animaguskid,Pretty nice app,This app has a pretty complete list of reviewed products. I've been able to find a few things that aren't listed but I'm seeing that less now then when I originally downloaded this app a few weeks ago. It's a lot of fun to see what grade different products will get
1347,1347,5,2012-10-16T00:01:12.000Z,mdpooh,Awesome!,"Best app for nutrition and food education. Makes it so much easier to shop healthy and smart when there is a nutritional grade attached to your purchase. Amazed to have learned how many products that are advertised as nutritious and healthy, but were filled unhealthy ingredients and hidden sugar and sodium. This app will always be a staple in all my smartphones."
1348,1348,5,2012-12-28T15:37:18.000Z,Rtmatt1,New user,"Just getting started, but after spending about thirty minutes checking out this APP I think I'm going to get a lot of use out of it."
1349,1349,5,2013-02-05T02:25:45.000Z,Elfnts,Best app to stay and eat healthy!,Everything you need to know about what you eat in one app!! So much information but all is easy and quick to use to eat and cook as healthy as you can. Love the 'alternative options' it shows so you don't have to seek out and find the best alternatives to what you already get.
1350,1350,5,2011-07-01T00:01:14.000Z,AriesDime,Great idea,"I love this app, it's very informative, I learned a lot in 1 week about the foods I thought were ""better"" than others. Only thing I would like to see is when I share on FaceBook, others would be able to see the information about the products! This is an app I use everyday!"
1351,1351,5,2011-07-05T15:49:20.000Z,Keoni John,Absolutely Terrific ÓÄéÓÄéÓÄéÓÄéÓÄé,"Eat better using advice from dietitians. Food products have confusing ingredient lists and hyped health claims. This app demystifies all of that by using simple English, giving good & bad product highlights, and providing recommended alternatives. I didn't know the real truth about the food I was eating until I used this app."
1352,1352,5,2011-07-14T08:15:10.000Z,diamonddoll13,Very Informative!!!!,"I absolutely love this app, it's informative and makes making better and healthier food choices MUCH easier, especially while grocery shopping. I like that it offers alternatives to foods as well, and that it explains why a food is graded the way it is, may it be a bad grade or good grade. I can't believe it's free, highly recommend."
1353,1353,5,2011-07-24T14:39:54.000Z,sassySu08,If you care about what you eat....,"Then you definitely need this app!  I have learned so much about food, and especially I learn things I need to know BEFORE I buy it.  They have detailed information on most foods, and offer a way to submit information on foods when they don't yet have a listing. This one is indispensable!"
1354,1354,5,2013-01-29T21:03:33.000Z,fancielynne,Love this app!!!,"This app, with its scanner, ingredient info, and ease of use, has helped me to see exactly what I eat, what's in it, and what to stay away from, with its GMO alert. It is helping me to be a better food consumer, and eat more healthy. It's got everything a person who wants to be healthy, could possibly want, to reach their goals. Love it!!"
1355,1355,4,2013-04-03T17:01:55.000Z,MellyRaeSunshine,Pretty good,"Sometimes it seems the app has its own agenda and rates foods very low for prejudice against a certain ingredient. It also is incorrect as to some caloric and ingredient info, would be nice to update or be able to flag it. But overall it's a great app that calls attention to things people may not see or notice, like possible GMO ingredients or inulin or colorings. I like the alternative food suggestor."
1356,1356,5,2013-06-11T00:50:25.000Z,Babeelee77,Fun with family,Love this app. It's nice to know good from the bad and my 8 year old loves it too. She even had me scan candy to see what grade was given....she didn't ask me for any type of junk food and also told her dad certain foods weren't good for him. I also love the reminder to use it when I pull up to the store
1357,1357,4,2014-05-02T03:00:06.000Z,aliyarnell,Alice W. Yarnell,I think that Fooducate is a very good website. One problem I found in the variance of calories for the same item by different users. It would be good if everyone could report the same number of calories for the same product. They are also showing different grades. Is there anything that can be done about these problems?
1358,1358,4,2016-02-22T18:47:53.000Z,Kristi June,Works for me :),"I've only been using this app for a little over a week and it seems to be a great alternative to do a ""self started"" weight watchers type of diet. So far any foods I've needed have been in the system already and I like that you can change from calories to food points or however you are wanting to manage your diet. So far so good!"
1359,1359,5,2017-02-27T15:49:44.000Z,Nerjasax,Very useful,Often times I find myself at the grocery store faced with too many options for the same thing...I'm able to quickly and easily pick the healthiest option using this app. Barcode scanner makes this all the easier to use.

I scanned a few items I already had in my cupboard and felt guilty! I need to stop taking everything written on the front of the package for face value! This app will definitely be with me during my next shopping trip!"

Constantly updating database, love the option to take pics and upload so they can add products to their database. My only suggestion (minor) is to add the ability to group delete messages."
1362,1362,5,2011-09-17T19:41:36.000Z,DamnTam,Great App,"I love this app.   I use it all the time in the grocery store.   I scan the barcode and it tells me all about the nutritional value without having to decipher the nutrition label.   Also, it calculates dieter's points the same as the weight watchers points plus system so I can tell if it is also worth the points plus value."
1363,1363,5,2012-06-08T23:09:08.000Z,LaurenBrooke1843,Might be the best app in the app store!,I LOVE this app!!! The first day I got it I was so obsessed I ran around scanning all the food in my house lol! I would have paid $5 for this app honestly. I love that it gives you such an in depth review of the foods AND gives you alternatives! I just hope the makers of this app keep up with it and continue to add food! :)
1364,1364,5,2012-08-31T15:25:25.000Z,Danaandgreg,Very useful app! Love it - u need no other!!,This is the perfect app - the scanner picks up easily & lists all kinds of items - even helps me to add items that are not listed! I feel better prepared in making healthier selections for my family. I'm so glad (& thankful) for this app! I'm totally satisfied and would highly recommend it!

1369,1369,5,2017-05-17T17:52:09.000Z,AdriannaBell,Love it!,"My favorite part is that it gives me healthier alternatives and explanations for why some things are rated lower so for example, if it is high in sodium and that isn't a concern for me at least I'm educated on my choices. I also like seeing my progress on weight loss even if it is up and down sometimes."
1370,1370,5,2013-03-04T03:26:21.000Z,Whoyle,Thank you!,This App is exactly what I was looking for - incredibly easy to use and extremely informative about what we are putting into our bodies. There are so many calorie count and exercise tracking apps out there but this goes beyond that and offers alternatives and health risks for each item. LOVE
1371,1371,5,2013-07-13T12:24:42.000Z,Vicki in Virginia,Love this app!,"I am so glad someone told me about this app I had it for a while before I started using it but once I created an account and put my weight, goals, what I was eating my workouts, etc i have come to depend on this app for tracking my burned calories and what I can eat based on my workouts etc! I love it!"
1372,1372,4,2013-08-20T02:40:21.000Z,sool22,Best food & exercise tracking app for me,"this app stacks up against the other apps out there. The design is attractive as well as ability to scan foods and adjust servings. It does a decent job at guessing how many calories you've burned but even when you've tracked a different amt, you can change it. I tried MyNetDiary and MyFitnessPal which are both good but I like Fooducate best."
1373,1373,4,2014-01-10T08:43:18.000Z,Garnet6106,Great but could use a few more tweaks,"I've had this app for a while and it's been very useful. However, the latest update required a whole new app and now a subscription is required. Not sure I'm too happy with that now. I'm not really interested in all the extra features. I just want to use it to scan stuff at the store and that's it."
1374,1374,5,2014-04-24T20:43:52.000Z,Chevybritt,Awesome!,"I love this app! It tells me Everything I need to know about what I'm about to eat. And with this App's help, I've already lost 5 pounds. Not changing much, but watching what I'm eating! If your looking for something that gives you all of your info on a food, this Apps for you!! Thank you for making Fooducate!!"
1375,1375,3,2015-09-01T01:58:46.000Z,BDMacGee,Unable to customize,Overall I like the app. It's set up well.
1376,1376,2,2015-10-02T03:06:17.000Z,Mcmollie,Buggy Update,"Edited 10/1: Latest update fixed some of the previous bugs and I like the features, but now I'm unable to enter any new food. It's practically useless for me at this point since I can only quick add calories right now."
1377,1377,5,2016-01-20T08:44:25.000Z,Jugffthiv,Great app!,"This is a great app! Every time we shop, we use the Food Finder to switch out at least one item for a better alternative. With Congress so enamored with big food companies and CAFO's, we can't rely on proper, honest labeling. With this app I can take the power back and put food (rather than chemicals) in my family's mouth."
1378,1378,5,2016-07-20T21:56:54.000Z,MUSIC LOVER$$$$$$,"I use this app EVERYDAY, love it!!!","I don't go to the grocery store without it. It takes the guess work out of label reading and gives me a detailed assessment of the health value, as well as the low down on on the additives (which I can barely pronounce) I can make truly healthy choices for myself and my family."
1379,1379,5,2016-08-15T14:19:24.000Z,Deco mab,Just great,"So easy to use, intuitive - for anyone trying to track their daily intake of everything! Would be super if once you chose a fraction of portion size the nutrition information - specifically sugars - for those who need to monitor that value - would adjust automatically as well :)"
1380,1380,5,2011-04-26T16:35:50.000Z,hbanana42,I love it!,"Not only is it awesome , they have contests that you can win stuff. You don't have to sign up, you just scan! I love all the info that the program offers when you scan a product. And it gives you alternative foods to eat that's healthier for you. I love this program. Highly recommended."
1381,1381,5,2011-05-19T22:19:27.000Z,ThaPrissy1,Love this App,This app is AWESOME & its FREE!!! Spent 3 hrs in the store & I scanned almost 150 items--at least now there is not 1 single item in my kitchen below a B-  It also help me choose healthier choices! Some things Ive been eating that are thought were healthy didnt score so well so that means I will never buy them again! Thanks Fooducate for helping me be a healthier person!!!
1382,1382,4,2011-07-19T09:41:15.000Z,Sharon1985,VERY GOOD,"This app (Fooducate) is a very useful app. When I first got it I used it each time I went to the supermarket. A lot of the products I scanned were rated a C, which was very disappointing, but I learned about the unhealthy ingredients of food such as preservatives and other things I wasn't even aware of. All in all I recommend this app. It is convenient, easy to use and understand and best of all, it is free."
1383,1383,5,2011-12-27T21:47:19.000Z,Beautiful gilz,Great for decision making,I love this app because it gives you the information you need quickly. It tells you the ingredients that you should be aware of and helps to steer you in the right direction. The app also gives better alternatives so you can use it while shopping.
1384,1384,5,2011-12-30T21:27:40.000Z,MDPunome,Great way to start being healthy,If you're ever confused or concerned about whether or not your food choices are healthy this is the app for you. The best part is that they give you healthier alternatives to any product you look up! Plus you get detailed descriptions on why each item is healthy or unhealthy. Great app.
1385,1385,5,2012-03-02T16:51:13.000Z,Jack_London,Great app. Seriously use it every time when grocery shopping.,Great app. Seriously use it every time when grocery shopping. Has quick an easy ratings to go off of as well for the things you scan. It is able to pull up everything I have scanned so far.
1386,1386,5,2012-05-19T22:08:53.000Z,Simple and people friendly,Wellness,I have recently become familiar with fooducate and find it very beneficial in learning about  various foods and their nutritional value. For this reason it really does help to contribute to over all Heath and wellness. It is very simple to use and people friendly. Just point and click. I am greatful that this app is available for my iPhone.
1387,1387,5,2013-02-19T06:31:59.000Z,bgh367,Very informative,"This app gives you real insight on food and what it's really made of! I was so surprised to see that some of the foods I thought were considered ""healthy"" actually had GMO's and other scary things in them. It really makes you aware of what you're eating and think before eating something. Wonderful app!!"
1388,1388,5,2015-06-29T18:58:43.000Z,NickyDavi,In love,"My fitnesspal app keeps messing up n today I downloaded this again. I love how it gives you information about the food you post ABC -+ etc, so you can know to take that food out of your house. So far I am loving it I am sure it will help me to stay on track plus lose weight. Thx"
1389,1389,5,2016-09-18T17:34:54.000Z,camilazarazua,Only one suggestion....,"This app is amazing but I have one suggestion. It would be amazing if you guys could let us know if the item is vegan. I always have to read all the ingredients, even when I'm in a bit of a hurry. Needing to just scan something and know if it's vegan or not would be a game changer"
1390,1390,5,2012-06-25T14:29:28.000Z,Fgjufsj,Excellent,"Well-researched, organized, and informative without being preachy, condescending or dumbed-down.  Great for the more experienced food-label reader, yet friendly for those who are learning about food additives and making smarter food choices.  Easy-to-use interface with clean, bright graphics and uncluttered layout.  :)"
1391,1391,5,2012-10-16T13:14:55.000Z,eveg67,Very informative app!,I teach nutrition and I recommend this app to all of my students. It really helps them make healthy choices when shopping. Marketing can be misleading and sometimes reading the labels can be confusing. This makes it simple to know what to eat and what to stay away from.
1392,1392,4,2013-02-07T16:25:43.000Z,MidnightShadows,Great app!,"Making sure you really know what is going in to your body is incredibly important and this app makes it to simple. Just scan the barcode, tell it how much you ate and you're done!"
1393,1393,5,2013-02-28T04:30:47.000Z,Quarato,Great app,"I go armed with my iPhone to the market. I scans every box I buy. If it scans A or B I buy it. B- maybe, C the product go back on the shelf for someone else to buy. I am trying to but as many A products as possible.  This app makes you aware of how much trash food is out there. This app should come on every smart phone."
1394,1394,5,2013-03-31T16:40:02.000Z,El-Magnifico,Very good,I find it easy to use and has lots of food information. I wish there was a way to create your own food with your own info for things you make yourself. Or maybe some stock info for things like cuts of meat. I'd also like to have an easy to access list of favorite foods.
1395,1395,5,2013-06-09T13:34:24.000Z,Flygirllaura,Awesome,"This app is perfect, I wanted to easily look up the nutritional info of foods but not track everything I eat. This app lets you set goals that are health related not weight related. You can use it to track your calories and weight but it does so much more! I tried lots of similar apps and this one is the best."
1396,1396,5,2013-06-22T19:01:23.000Z,Maryf12,Love it except,"I love this app except some products I've scanned the calorie count is different on the item and in the app. But over all great app, comes in handy when grocery shopping and making a grocery list! Love reading the comments on different foods that people put their own recipe or twist on how they cook theirs!"
1397,1397,5,2014-07-14T14:30:34.000Z,Duffy001,Great enabler,"The scan function is very useful, but the tracking that comes with the upgrade is superior.  I can track my intake for all nutrients and make adjustments through the day to arrive at my targeted goals.  I also enjoy the daily articles that are educational.  The frequency reinforces healthy eating habits."
1398,1398,5,2014-09-03T14:18:06.000Z,Kafaka,I love this app!,"I tell everyone about this app because it is fun and educational.  The articles and tips are great. Love that it gives alternatives- though some are kind of hard to find. Still striving for an ""A"" day but the process makes me more conscious about what I am eating than any other app or diet ever has."
1399,1399,5,2015-05-14T18:28:58.000Z,Mego404,Good,This is a wonderful app. It makes it easy to see the nutritional content of the foods you eat daily. My only complaint is that I don't like seeing the comments left by people on the different foods. I don't care that someone loves or hates a certain food. It's aggravating that you can't hide the comments.
1400,1400,5,2011-07-10T14:25:11.000Z,Oliveoil7979,Never shop with out it,This is hands down the best app I've gotten to help make better food choices. I love everything about it.
1401,1401,5,2011-07-24T14:53:02.000Z,JC07456,Great to have in the grocery store!,I started using this app right away to help my kids make healthy choices in the grocery store. My son is now keenly interested in picking foods that he likes with good nutritional scores.
1402,1402,4,2011-07-24T22:06:44.000Z,Corolla17,Love this,"I have told so many people about this app and they have downloaded it and loved it as well. It gives so much relevant and helpful info about each product. The reason I didn't give it five stars, which it deserves, is because I bought an ipad2 and couldn't wait to use this app, but it won't read the barcodes. I was so disappointed. Otherwise FANTASTIC app!"
1403,1403,5,2011-08-26T15:30:48.000Z,The thankful assistant,Best nutritional education app ever,"I thought I was eating healthy until I started using this app and discovered all the hidden health risks in my food choices.  I love all the information provided, the ratings and especially the five alternative foods which offer better options.  Everyone should have this app."
1404,1404,4,2011-11-19T14:19:53.000Z,Ejshou,Great!,"Love this app.  It's been great for making decisions in the store and for educating us on how unhealthy are some of the regular brand items we were eating. My only criticism would be that oftentimes the alternatives offered seem to be obscure brands that I don't have at my grocery.  We have a great grocery, extensive grocer, but no trader joes or whole foods near us and many times I cannot find the alternatives."
1405,1405,5,2011-11-22T00:47:49.000Z,Mynameisntimportant,Changed the way I eat!,Super easy to use and I've learned so much!  It's helping me make better decisions about what I eat while teaching me to recognize what makes good things good.  It also teaches about common marketing tricks that food manufacturers will use to mislead consumers about the quality or creation o a product.
1406,1406,4,2012-02-07T18:56:41.000Z,Luckyladyd,Excellent app but many products not found,"When I break out the iPhone to shop with fooducate, I take so much longer because I spend a lot of time sending photos back for missing products. I know it only works if we contribute, however it does seem a good percentage of things in my stores are not found.  Overall it is a neat app."
1407,1407,5,2015-08-17T12:20:27.000Z,smartyhope,A positive motivator,I heard about this tool during a continuing education course for dentistry. The excessive amount of sugar being added to everything has become alarming. This app is a fantastic aid to help rate your food items without getting bombarded by the numerous choices and lengthy labels. Very helpful tool for a busy working mom.
1408,1408,5,2015-12-03T02:21:43.000Z,thriftyturtle,Best Nutrition/Health App,"I have been looking for something that could educate me on what I was eating and what was good or bad about it. I feel like I just don't understand all the calorie/carb/fat counting. This was perfect. Great articles, add your meals/recipes, scan your groceries... I felt like I understand for once what I'm actually eating. Great app! I use it daily!"
1409,1409,5,2016-04-10T17:59:57.000Z,LindaDFLA,Super easy app!,"This app is so simple to use for keeping track of your calories, carbohydrates and sugars! Just scan a barcode on your product or scroll through all of the menu items on many many restaurant listings. I've been using this app for a several years and love love love it!"
1410,1410,5,2013-01-16T16:08:43.000Z,einstein749,Love it,Loving this app. Scanner works well. Lots of products in the database. Had a new food added within a couple days of my request. Detailed nutrition info and good tips about what makes a food healthy. Clean UI. Thanks to the developers and please keep this one going. I would be highly upset to see it die.
1411,1411,5,2013-02-20T14:07:48.000Z,Mel_19,Great app,This app is amazing! I scan everything I buy and if it's lower then a B I won't buy it. It's very helpful for people who live a healthy lifestyle and tells me everything I need to know about what I'm buying. I'm also vegan so it will tell me whether a product is vegan or not and the alternatives I can buy. Def the best app I ever used!
1412,1412,2,2013-05-17T02:35:38.000Z,garbageapp11111111,Annoyed,"This app was awesome but for some reason with a recent update the scanner doesn't work anymore. I figured they would notice the bug and fix it but that was several months ago and still nothing. Instead of posting a negative comment I wanted to report the bug but when I clicked on the button it lead me to their homepage and I said you know what this is just too much effort for a stupid app. You had a good thing going, bummed you changed it."
1413,1413,2,2013-12-07T14:59:32.000Z,iPodTouchUser522,Not what it use to be,I use to use this app a while ago. I just downloaded it again because I really like the ability to see what food is really processed and what's not. It's absolutely great for that.
1414,1414,5,2014-01-07T04:41:36.000Z,Nat D. M.,New user,Thoroughly impressed with how quick items not in data base get added. It's so neat to be able to contribute to the available selections. Having the option to scan your foods in the tracker instead of always typing them in is awesome. Time saver for sure. Love the app!
1415,1415,5,2014-02-04T00:58:26.000Z,Kitten1295,Fantabulous App,"The best App ever if you are a health conscious individual or wanting to make better food choices. Has helped me select better brands with better and healthier ingredients. The rating system is great. I recommend this App to everyone. If you are on Weight Watchers, it gives you the point values per serving."
1416,1416,5,2014-02-16T11:42:01.000Z,Hbcw44,So grateful for this app!!!!,"This is hands down, the best app on my phone. I can't live without it!! I would recommend it to anyone who is conscious about what they are putting in their body.  This app has convinced me that cancer is running rampant in our country bc of the food source. Thank you for helping me protect my family!!!"
1417,1417,5,2014-07-27T08:45:53.000Z,LisaLo21,Great info,Love using this app while grocery shopping to scan bar codes. The app grades the nutrition value of the food and provides better alternatives. Also enjoy reading the articles.  I have recommended this app to those who take interest in the good they put on their bodies.
1418,1418,3,2014-08-14T17:40:27.000Z,Joelle Silverman,new update...,I really don't like the new update...it shows too many products added by users and not the actual product I'm looking for. I don't always have the time to scan each individual box and sometimes searching it is easier but now that there are so so many user added products it takes double the time to come across the one I'm looking for.
1419,1419,5,2015-02-14T21:17:30.000Z,Manalins,Great resource to learn what's in your food,"Fooducate is amazing. If you want to know what you're really eating (and you should) just scan the barcode or enter in the item and the app tells you a grade, the ingredients and explanation of how healthy it is. Great for reducing amount of processed food in your diet. Highly recommend."
1420,1420,1,2011-04-19T15:09:34.000Z,Dvrman Wunder,Don't understand,I have scanned a few items and it always just goes back to the scanning screen after a search. So I guess that means it didn't find the product. Also I have had 3 unread messages for weeks now and when I go to read them it says no unread messages right below where it says 3 unread messages. Huh?  I have reinstalled and still the same thing. Don't know what I am doing wrong.  1 star until I can figure this out. 1 star for me if it is operator error but I don't know what I could possibly be doing.
1421,1421,4,2011-08-03T07:21:20.000Z,Hawkie409,Not bad,"Turns out what I eat is mostly C's.. Ah well. Win some, lose some. Anyways, the app itself is pretty good. Has everything I can think of except a few local-only store brands such as Market Basket and H-E-B."
1422,1422,5,2011-08-05T01:05:22.000Z,jir2324,Dare to Relearn What to Eat,Quite an eye opener to what we choose to consume! Many people may not care what they eat until they get a heart attack or worse. We all can live full lives if we educate ourselves and this app does just that. Thank you to all the researchers that provide accurate assessments to foods that are healthy and wholesome.
1423,1423,5,2011-08-19T18:15:56.000Z,123DD,Great App AND Customer Service!,"Great app. Offers so much information! Very compatible with the Weight Watchers points plus program. I found a point discrepancy with one product and wrote to them. They immediately wrote back, asked for more info, fixed the problem and followed up with me!!"
1424,1424,5,2012-03-21T02:23:25.000Z,Jrowe456,Phenomenal App. So easy and informative!,This app is awesome. The best free app I've had in a looooong time. So much great information. Especially about things I had no idea were not so good. Im on WW too and this is PERFECT. why does WW not have this scanning ability?? Crazy. Makes tracking so easy! This app in incredible. Thanks for this gift! So much crap in our food!
1425,1425,4,2012-06-03T22:24:35.000Z,quazforb,"Easy to use, informative","App makes it easy to get information about stuff. Some of the ratings seem a little preachy and arbitrary (e.g. rating a frozen low-calorie meal a D because there are healthier alternatives, while giving diet soda, which has no health value whatsoever, a C- ) but once you figure out the biases it's useful and makes you feel better about what you're choosing."
1426,1426,4,2015-08-25T04:57:32.000Z,Yana___1,Works well,Moving around this app is very seamless. I cannot rave about the design and user experience enough. It is filled with great facts that are useful when shopping and also has a great feature to help with losing weight by eating a healthy diet specific to your caloric needs that adjust with every few pounds you lose. Worth a try!
1427,1427,5,2016-05-27T16:05:24.000Z,Iledelph,Great resource for anyone eating healthier,I love this app! It's easy to use since you scan your foods to find out the pros and cons of what you're eating.  It's also easy to add new foods to the list and check the score if it's not already in the data base.  Great for parents who want their kids to be eating nutrient rich foods.
1428,1428,5,2016-07-09T16:36:34.000Z,marcus330,"Rate, explain, offer an alternative","This app really lives up to its name. It does all the things that other health apps like Lose It do, but it's additional features of rating food, providing detailed and well-sourced explanations for these ratings, and offering alternatives to help improve your nutritional life."
1429,1429,5,2016-08-01T21:57:34.000Z,Coolckick,Enlightening,"Being a ballet dancer who has a rigorous schedule six days a week, I always assumed I would burn off everything and I didn't have to be AS cautious of what I was putting in my body. This app really helped me see that I was wrong. I really believe it will aid me beneficially in my journey to weight loss and a healthy lifestyle."
1430,1430,5,2012-11-17T12:52:55.000Z,Cdooin,Amazing!,"I usually shop very healthy anyway but now with this app, grocery shopping takes a lot longer. The food I thought was extremely healthy isn't. Other than a slight headache when I leave the store from concentrating so hard, I will still rate this app excellent."
1431,1431,4,2013-01-06T16:24:37.000Z,Belle73458,Only problem ....,"This app is great! My only complaint is that it doesn't let you choose the amount of carbohydrates or calories that you want to consume,  some diets have much less-  like the Atkins diet just has allowed for the induction phase of 20 carbohydrates. And to lose weight I want much less than 1000 something that it requested to eat on a daily basis."
1432,1432,5,2013-03-10T23:02:43.000Z,Schubie2,Love this app,I use this app all the time.  It's amazing how many food items I thought were healthy alternatives to other items - only to find I was way off base! I use the GMO function too. Use it at home and the grocery store.  I am a weight watcher member and love that it also gives food point values!
1433,1433,5,2013-04-21T03:18:58.000Z,Screenplaywriter,Lost a pound a day so far,"Well. Okay. So it's easy for me to go on a diet but this app made it easy to show my husband I could not eat whatever he was shoving at me. Also the scanner made a great calorie counter, however I think it could be improved with suggesting what I should eat next such as suggesting a protein or starch."
1434,1434,4,2014-01-09T19:14:47.000Z,Splasia,Done and cancel buttons are backwards,"This is a really awesome app! It has calorie information like MyFitnessPal and points systems for dieters akin to Weight Watchers, and the barcode reader isn't too finicky, but the cancel and submit buttons are reverse than their position in every other app. I suppose you get used to it, but I've accidentally deleted almost every submission."
1435,1435,4,2014-02-04T21:47:40.000Z,Cncpyro,Not bad!,"I would give it 5 stars but more often then not when I go to scan an item, it more than likely not in their data base and I'm having to submit everything to them....at this point I feel like they should be paying me for doing their job....that's why I have it 4 stars...overall great concept and good app!"
1436,1436,4,2014-05-23T11:46:54.000Z,Warbus,Great App but lot of ads if not Premium,It has been useful to track my food. And I like the end of day summary. But there are a lot of annoying ads pop ups and requests to review. That being said here is my positive review despite that. Also I love the food library and the rating system amount information collected on each food.
1437,1437,5,2014-12-31T23:55:16.000Z,Clenzini,Great App,I am a former weight watchers participant and I used WW e-tools. This app is similar but gets into greater detail regarding food choices. It will give the food a grade and also offers healthier alternatives. Although it seems costly for an app - it's the same as a one month subscription to WW. Easy to use and it syncs with other health apps.
1438,1438,4,2015-04-06T19:29:08.000Z,Handsome Dude,Rasheed93,"I just downloaded this and I am very pleased with all the information I can get on products and their alternatives. It is an excellent app if you want to know what certain ingredients are and I like the rating system it uses,  it's very helpful and I would definitely recommend this app to a friend or anyone who cares about what they eat."
1439,1439,5,2015-08-17T23:04:38.000Z,AmberDNP,Amazing way to be mindful,This is so user friendly and makes it so much easier to be mindful about what I eat and make better choices. I have struggled with my weight my whole life and this app makes it so I am not hungry because I know what to eat and what has lower calories so I can eat more!
1440,1440,5,2011-04-27T05:38:38.000Z,MommaLuLA,Love this app!,highly recommend this app our 12 year old uses it to scan products both at home and at the market and he is having fun learning about food and making better choices.  great for kids and adults who want to learn more about what foods they eat.
1441,1441,5,2011-06-14T14:32:33.000Z,Rainkissed,Wonderful!,"This app is so helpful to anyone who cares about what they are consuming. I watch what I eat but a lot of ""healthy"" products marketed have added and sometimes harmful ingredients. This barcode scanner does more than tell you what the product is--it tells you what's in it and if it's healthy!"
1442,1442,5,2014-03-14T15:01:05.000Z,a crunchy chick,Great for healthy living,"Fooducate is perfect because it has an option for calculating caloric & dietary needs for women who are breast feeding, vegans, vegetarians, and other special considerations. It also will issue reminders without being obnoxious. I also like the articles posted on the home page."
1443,1443,5,2014-04-14T00:10:29.000Z,Pandaem0nium,Seriously a must-have app!!,"This has made such a huge difference in the things I buy and eat. I realise now just how many unhealthy things masquerading as ""good-for-you"" foods I've been buying and consuming for a long time. Now I'm better educated lol seriously, I encourage everyone to get this app!!"
1444,1444,4,2014-07-21T20:13:04.000Z,T8255,No information,"Ive bought this app over a year ago & theres not much bad to say. Considering a year+ I just recently had issues with the health tracker not even showing up & same for contact/support. So, all dietary points & values I manually did, which defeats the point of the app. Hopefully, they'll fix the 'bug' and I can continue loving Fooducate app."
1445,1445,4,2015-04-16T02:37:39.000Z,Scerenia,Could use more utilities for exercise but otherwise great,It's a great app and provides many options for food and exercise. It's simple and easy to use even if you're often busy. I just wish that it had the same summaries for workout amount/quality per day as it does for calorie amount and quality.
1446,1446,5,2015-05-21T22:04:28.000Z,desiraee55,Life SAVER,This app helps me stay on track by giving me alternatives and tips. Something I didn't have on other apps I was using. When I had a craving for something I knew wasn't good for me i would just eat it anyway because I didn't know anything else to eat. But the alternatives help so much. I love it.

I love that this grades the food, explains the grade, and gives you better alternatives. I wish it tracked carbs in the free version. You have to pay to count carbs. The food database is great. Seems to recognize some aldi brands which is mostly where I shop. Just wish the free version had more options."

I've been only tracking my calories for 2 days but this app is very informative and helpful on the calories you need per day to loose ""x amount"" of weight by such and such date. It's a pretty good app. I can't weight to lose weight on this app."

1451,1451,5,2012-04-19T16:31:39.000Z,tickle peeper,Really useful,"I tend to expect too much from apps, but this one is just great. It doesn't always have data on obscure products, but that is to be expected. This app does what it says and does it well. It would be hard to think of ways to improve this app."
1452,1452,4,2012-07-08T14:18:50.000Z,rockerchik713,Good to use,"I am a health nut, so I like to know what's in the food I buy. This gives me a pretty good read on what's in my food - both what I want in it and what I don't want in it. The recommendations could use some work though, as some of what's recommended can be higher in added sugar or some other ingredient you don't want. Overall though a really good product."

Use it as a supplement to your current weight loss program; Or like me use it in loo of other paid programs. Free and easy to use. Definitely worth downloading and giving it a try. üëçüëç"
1454,1454,5,2013-03-30T14:06:04.000Z,Mayersfo4,Great App!,"I love this app because it is so easy to use and read. A lot of similar apps give the same nutritional breakdown, but this ones rates your food between A and D so it is much easier to read. It also tells you what the red flags of your meal are so you know what to look out for later. This is a great app!"

Tells me everything about the food from fat, carbs, protein, and vitamins, to facts about sodium, cholesterol, processed foods etc. so much info and helps me keep track during the day. It would be nice if at the end of the day it would give you a total of fats, proteins, etc. it does for carbs and cals but not anything else üòî"
1456,1456,5,2013-05-25T13:14:13.000Z,castorsam,Wow!,This app is great! It's helped me realize some of things I was picking at the store were not the best choices and I can easily find a better product to choose in no time by using the scanner!   Definitely one of the most used apps on my phone! Couldn't go without it now! Thanks Fooducate :)

Amazingly, most of the name brands & a lot of the lesser brands are there in their listings. I  really appreciate the help with what I eat. It makes food shopping so much easier with the scan feature."
1460,1460,3,2011-06-18T15:46:35.000Z,rainsageskye,Next Update,"This app is amazing! But, I think that when you do a comparison, you should be able to click that item and find the nearest store that sells that item. You could also add comparison prices. Please add more products because going through our pantry, you had at least 10 items that you didn't recognize. Other than that, this application is helpful! I give this app 3.5 stars"
1461,1461,4,2011-07-07T13:18:28.000Z,1st Light,1st impression,As a new user I find it useful for items already in the data base. Consistency between labels on the product vs those in data base are acceptable.  Response to items not already in the data base is too slow.  Alternatives are generally difficult to find in same location.  Would like to see pricing added to this app.

With this application I am able to keep a more accurate track of food items. I didn't believe it when I saw this app in action. I recommend it to anybody staying in shape or on a wright loss program.
1464,1464,5,2011-11-16T03:21:12.000Z,blugirl01,Love this app,This app is so helpful in how I go about choosing what packaged foods I buy. If something gets a C or lower it doesn't go in my basket. I've gotten funny looks  when I scan my food and the ding happens. It does give me an opportunity to tell people about the app though. Thank you iTunes for having this great app

It's also interesting to know how many calories you are actually taking in with out any hard work."

Better than any other I have tried, it is very thorough and provides a great breakdown of the foods you eat as well as making you aware of good calories and bad. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is a little more difficult to navigate than other apps"
1467,1467,5,2017-04-13T03:47:03.000Z,Donna IN,Great App +A,This is my second year using this app. I started using it because I was having a problem controlling my blood sugar. I was able right away to get it under control and keep it that way. It has also helped me keep my wait stable. My doctor was very pleased.
1468,1468,2,2017-04-22T14:31:14.000Z,KingElgin,Love the Info but the app needs an upgrade,"I do love all of the great info and the rating system. The reason for my low star rating is the lack of a search feature. The browse option is not cutting it. And I'm not in store shopping while using the app, I'm trying to plan my list ahead of time so scanning isn't an option. The only way I can search is through google which will take me back to the app. Why not add this as a feature?"

The only thing I would change would be when you type in what you already scanned or recorded, it would scroll up on ""recent"" tab rather then finding it all over again.

1484,1484,5,2014-05-29T03:49:08.000Z,Tree357941,Loving it,This app is great for becoming more aware of the foods that you are eating (and how much of them). The design is intuitive and simple yet informative. I also appreciate that you can select breastfeeding since this changes caloric intake (although you have to have an upgrade).
1485,1485,5,2015-01-06T19:28:16.000Z,Cch2014,Love,I just happened to hear about this app on a tv show that was playing in another room & decided to look it up. It's great! I had been using a different site for a long time but gained back all my bad habits. I enjoy the rating system & the pie chart of processed food consumption.

1487,1487,5,2016-08-01T20:55:49.000Z,Noob city,Simplistic but very intuitive.,I love this app already. It has a simple interface but it's packed useful information regarding what to eat and what not. I have a high cholesterol and using this app has helped me lower it to a good level by using the food scanner to check the nutrition and its grade.
1488,1488,5,2016-10-03T14:06:56.000Z,DustMePink,Love this app,I found this app on accident but I'm really glad I did. I have been using fitness pal and I thought it was the best till I found this one. The community here is great lots of support and ppl to help motivate you to keep going.

Tried nationally recognized products, regional products and local products. Poor job in all three categories.  While doing a search for a particularly large regional grocery store for their Italian bread I received every conceivable item that was Italian in any store even though I chose Publix Italian Bread so I would limit the number of hits.  Deleted app."
1490,1490,4,2012-02-05T16:12:45.000Z,travelcrazy1,Love it!!,Easy to use and navigate! I've shared it w many friends and people have asked me in the aisles what I am using when they see us scanning our options! I live handing it to my 13 yr old and telling her she can pick any snack that is a B and up!! She is not thrilled but it's a great tool to help make people aware of what is in their foods and to make better choices.
1491,1491,5,2012-04-16T00:35:32.000Z,Pilarh,Excellent guide for choosing healthy food!,Very educational and informative. I love how it points out when a product has preservatives or less nutritious ingredients. I also love the suggestions and even recipes it gives as alternatives! This is a must have when changing your diet for the better/best.

In 5 minutes using the app, I was learned that the substitute sweetener I was using wasn't really a better choice for my diabetic husband; learned of The Dirty Dozen- the 12 fruits and vegetables to buy organic as they are heavily sprayed with insecticides; The Clean 15- fruits and veggies that are not sprayed much or do not hold onto the insecticides so organic for these, eh.

I can't believe how many unnecessary things I DID NOT buy because of how unhealthy they were. This app is like carrying a nutritionist with you during groceries.

They are great about letting you add products to their db that they don't have on file and they update as soon as they can.

For instance heart, vegan, vegetarian, or processed foods just to name a few. You can get a quick food grade, or read more if you have the time.

As long as they keep expanding their library of items the APP can scan...this is well worth the download and I wouldn't mind paying for a tool like this.  Very good job.

I was surprised to find it had many store brand (Giant) items too.  I've scanned at least 3 or 4 dozen items with no problems.  It is also a great way to involve children and help them make healthier choices-they love it!

Only I wish it could save products without adding it to the grocery list .. They should also add more products! And add more alternatives to junk food items."
1507,1507,4,2016-05-03T16:18:31.000Z,Ace1517,Very Helpful App,"I discovered this app by reading the Daily Herald. It provides very helpful information about different foods, and it raises my awareness of what I am actually putting into my body. The food database is large, but many of the store brands I consume are missing. Additionally, my experience of this app would be improved if Fooducate could interact with Fitbit and MyFitnessPal apps."
1508,1508,5,2017-03-09T03:35:41.000Z,Samphif,Fantastic,Great app with wonderful interface. Love the ranking system given to each item. Would like more transparency on items sent to be uploaded. All that was received back was and email stating usage is greater than normal and added item will take a while.

This app is helping me find the best food options and tracking calories and weight loss goal progression. Also helps with gluten free diet. Love it!"
1510,1510,5,2014-08-14T15:37:01.000Z,PATTI LC,GREAT APP! LOVE IT!!!!!,"I LOVE  this app. It is easy to use. I am often surprised at foods I thought were really healthy, and are not. Really good information so I can make better choices. Love the part where there are optional food if what I'm looking for doesn't have a good score. I share Fooducate with other people often. LOVE IT!!!"
1511,1511,1,2014-10-21T16:09:24.000Z,Sayde Aviviani,Looks nice..before you download it..,"This app looks awesome in the App Store, but once you download it, you are hounded to constantly pay for features that are commonly free in other apps!  Okay, say that you don't need all of the features that Fooducate has to offer.  Since you're still not paying for their apps subscription, you get to enjoy an advertisement banner at the bottom of your app.  Unless you're willing to pay a few bucks a month for this app, don't waste your time in he first place."
1512,1512,4,2015-01-12T19:46:46.000Z,RenoRN,Only good tracker app that counts added sugar,"I love this app for the added sugar tracking & pie charts showing % of protein, fats, carbs each day and for the supportive Twitter-like community. On the other hand, their list of foods to track is extremely small compared to any other tracker & the exercise calorie count does not factor your personal info so it way overestimates calorie burn."

Calorie count doesn't cut it anymore, it's calorie quality and WHAT I am actually eating. So helpful in my journey to move toward cutting out processed food and GMO. I use it every day to track everything I put I my body!"

I updated and it looks SO much better and has a lot more information on the foods I scan. It's very dependable when I'm not sure if I'm eating right.
1515,1515,4,2015-06-16T16:45:15.000Z,Desu desu,Room for improvements,"I have used two similar weight loss apps (Livestrong and MyFitnessPal) and I have to say that I love this one for the ""rating"" system on food health and processing along with its very fun visuals. If I could make a suggestion, however, it would be to allow for a higher variation of portion sizes (i.e. 1/8, 3/8, 5/8; 1/3, 2/3; 3/4) and better integration of these sizes at higher values (e.g. 2 1/4)."

1519,1519,5,2016-04-26T20:16:51.000Z,CONFUUUUUSED.,Love it already,I just downloaded this app but I can definitely see why so many people use it as a weight loss tool. I love that it not only examines calories but the ratings for each food items and explanations really help learn what your eating and how to better your health!

Only thing is sometimes new products aren't available you you have the option to add them and help our foodicate.
1522,1522,5,2011-08-28T23:49:27.000Z,BarbieLatina23,Amazing!,This app is great because it scans quickly and gives you a letter grade for the product as well as highlight the good and the bad ingredients with a summary of what they mean. It also gives you a list of healthier alternatives in the same product category. Thank you Fooducate for this very helpful app!!!!
1523,1523,5,2011-11-15T02:27:59.000Z,LKRebecca,I love this app,"This is a great app. I find myself scanning things before I buy them. The only issue I've had is when I've scanned a lot of items the ""scanner"" is unable to focus on the next item. It fixes it self when I restart the app other than that I love it. Truly an eye opener :)"

My new rule: students can only eat real food in my classroom with a rating of an A or B. Foods have become an academic topic thanks to the Fooducate app."

However I would like it to be able to calculate homemade meals better and also show me some sort of history of my previous meals. Like 7/10 days I met my calorie goal, or on what day I did best with my food points. But overall very helpful."

1533,1533,5,2013-06-17T14:03:20.000Z,<3 IS ALL,Wonderful,I really love this app. I thought I was shopping smart and healthy for my kids before but had quiet a rude awakening. I wish I could set it to weed out foods with specific thing I don't want but maybe you can do that on the paid version but I still love this thing nonetheless.
1534,1534,5,2014-01-20T23:03:33.000Z,Frances Haney,Thanks!,I begin with the only negative in this app and that is you cannot edit/ erase food list.  There are no complaints with anything else. Excellent teamwork - have learned great deal regarding nutrition - awareness of dangers in food - awareness of value in food - in other words I love this app & heartily thank everyone involved! Great work!
1535,1535,5,2015-05-04T15:02:04.000Z,MSU4ever,All-in-one!,"Great app! Provides guidelines for weight loss AND nutrition. You can track by calories and food points, which is great if you're coming off of WW. Please make this app universal (and enable iCloud sync) and provide a Notification Center widget...then it's definitely worth five stars and the best in its category!"

Good range of products to pick from, but I'm surprised at some that aren't already on there. I like you can save meals you make, bc I basically eat the same things every week. All around good app."

I love that it gives you food alternatives and grades the food you eat. This is an awesome app and I highly recommend it to anyone trying to watch what their eating!!

The only problem is the fact that it keeps crashing. Every time I open it I have about 1 minute and it automatically goes black a shuts down. Should definitely get an update to fix that but.

This app makes it clear and simple which products are healthier than another. It's a shame this app needs to be invented but I am grateful that it is. Great app!
1542,1542,5,2011-08-27T02:10:52.000Z,Bannbrady,Must share,I use this app all the time while shopping. It is easy to use and has helped me make better food decisions for my family. I have even had a few other savvy shoppers ask me what I was doing and I was happy to share with them this app and it's uses.

I'd like to see an upgrade that allows you to set a workout schedule with reminders for 7 days, and keep track of sets/reps and calculates progress, etc."
1545,1545,5,2013-02-01T18:11:12.000Z,MichelleCorzo,Love!,I absolutely love this app! It's great and really gives you great info not found on the nutrition label of so many foods. The only thing is that you can search meals that aren't packaged or sold in a supermarket and don't have a barcode. For example tuna roll with brown rice or tuna tacos.. But other than that it really is a great app!
1546,1546,5,2013-03-26T17:20:28.000Z,SaucyS321111,Useful,"I like this. It really breaks down the ingredients so you know exactly what you are eating. It had an extensive database, and they are good about adding things they don't have, if you submit a request.  Be warned, though - this will tell you that pretty much anything in a package isn't good for you (duh!)."

For instance I scanned a bag of popcorn at Whole Foods, it had the GMO project verified stamp on the bag and Fooducate let me know that it has a High Probability of GMO.. Not true.. So whoever is in charge of food updating may need to be replaced lol.. Or you could contact and pay me to update it! Haha! Otherwise this app has a ton of potential!!!"
1549,1549,4,2013-04-11T02:19:43.000Z,KrisMPLS,Wonderful,I love this app!  It looks at more than calories which I love.  I would rate it a five if you were able to save frequent meals and they had generic foods to look up such as a hamburger or grilled chicken so if you ate at a local restaurant that wasn't listed you could still track what you ate even if you don't know the brand of the food.

A must have for any foodie! Download ASAP!!!

1554,1554,5,2015-01-09T22:28:21.000Z,Luc270,Well done!,This app is very informative and well done. I could find most of the food products I buy through the scanner. That makes it so easy to know what you are actually eating. I feel I am much more in control of my food intake now.
1555,1555,5,2015-05-27T19:38:12.000Z,Lavish_bella,Helping me lose weight little by little.,This app is amazing. I recommend it for anybody who is busy and can't workout like they want to. It sets your caloric intake for you and using the scanner it's easy to track your food. Absolutely worth the click!

1557,1557,4,2016-01-05T00:57:48.000Z,ggggggill,Really Great...except...,This is a wonderful resource for keep regular tabs on your health. I just wish it was a little easier to enter homemade dishes. It takes quite a while to try to get it logged accurately. The resources in this app are really wonderful as a whole - even when compared to all the competition out there now.

I use Microsoft Outlook as my email client and no longer use the default mail client. When I try to contact customer support through the app or I want to add a new product to the database, I get an error saying I need to install the default email client.

I love all the info they have about foods. However, the actual diet tracking feature is awful! Can't control portion sizes well at all. Also it doesn't tell you how many of your calories came from protein, carbs, fat, etc. I prefer myfitnesspal. I wish the two could combine!!"

Fooducate breaks every food item down and informs you why it is not good for you. I also like that the app gives you healthy alternatives."

And one thing about this app that is really good is that it has you list everything you ate and drank each day. And it's one thing to know you ate a lot, but another to eat a lot AND THEN have to report it all. (Added motivator)"
1570,1570,2,2011-06-19T03:52:00.000Z,ProfFrink,Grades are misleading,"This app is a great idea, BUT the grades are inaccurate or at least misleading. I scanned dozens of things in my kitchen. Some of the products' grades made sense (e.g., potato chips got a C-). But others were downright nonsensical (e.g., plain old fashioned oatmeal only got a B+ and OJ got a C+... I'm sorry, but WHAT?!?!). I consider myself to be a rather informed individual when it comes to healthy eating, and this app's grading scheme made no sense about 1/3 of the time. You're better off learning how to read and understand labels yourself."

I can now use the watch to enter calories from a meal I just ate witch is nice. I also like how I can see what I have eaten and how much I have left. The app has also helped me pick out better foods at the store.
1575,1575,5,2016-04-07T02:09:55.000Z,IshfromLA,Great app to track food intake,It is great and there are additional pay option for more in depth features. But the free portion is great and is simple to use and keep track of daily in take. Library of items you can track is fast and vast. I'm liking it so far.
1576,1576,4,2016-05-12T22:04:26.000Z,mermaid wannabe,Not too shabby.,"The fact that this app gives you a grade on how healthy your food, I love. It helps me to be more aware and make better choices. I do wish tho that they would provide more personalization without having to paying for premium, but of course I'm also just cheap so it depends on the person."
1577,1577,4,2016-09-29T01:06:58.000Z,Amyhafemann,"Easy to use, simple","Love this app. Easy to use and log in food, water, and exercise. You can save meals that you eat often. I enjoy the articles and love reading about all the weird ingredients in food. All the foods are rated, too. I don't care for all the comments people write, just not my thing, so I just don't read those."
1578,1578,5,2017-02-28T01:14:54.000Z,Mcauch,Fantastic,I really like this because they don't just throw out a grade they also tell you why. Informed people make better choices. Doesn't mean I won't eat something with a C grade but at least I know where I stand and maybe make a better choice elsewhere
1579,1579,3,2017-05-11T19:29:24.000Z,FatGurlFedUp,Pretty good,"Seems like the points system is close to weight watchers but a little under. I also wish the food came with descriptions and options to add or omit certain items to get an accurate count of calories. Annnnd if there was a feature that said you have xx amount of calories left, you can eat these options for dinner.. would be super helpful."
1580,1580,5,2013-02-06T06:49:12.000Z,Cycleman2009,Good for grocery store purchases,"Easy to use, scanning is fast, extensive database, very very helpful to have products graded A-F and explanation of why, and helpful to know a product is one of the top rated in its category. Would be even better if it included restaurant food, but still a 5-star app."
1581,1581,5,2013-02-13T01:31:01.000Z,ElleKotzen,Better than Weight Watchers!,Love this app! I am a lifetime WW member and got bored and tired of entering points every day. I also got tired of eating the same foods but didn't know what else  to try.
1582,1582,5,2013-03-04T03:38:47.000Z,BrittneyColvard,FAVORITE APP,"This app has everything every good diet app has and more. You can learn more about what you eat so you can make healthier decisions and you can log food, exercise, and more! I recommend this app to all my friends and I use it AT LEAST three times a day minimum! No complaints whatsoever!!!"
1583,1583,5,2013-06-18T13:09:43.000Z,ANVKR,Fooducate,"Wonderful app! Accurate, reliable, easy to use. The only thing I would change is that they seem a bit slow with adding new food to their catalog. But they do make progress with it. Customer support is great, over all it gets 5 stars."
1584,1584,5,2013-07-26T17:02:30.000Z,Dsilva118,Love it!,"I've always maintained a healthy lifestyle, and have lived by the motto: everything in moderation. I still live by that motto, but now I can do an even better job of gauging my moderation. I love this app, and I especially like the feature that allows me to send an unknown product to fooducate to add to the database."
1585,1585,4,2013-08-23T13:51:04.000Z,Pavloskollias,Great product would love more,"I havent tried the track diet part since im using the myfitnesspal app. However the food ratings part is amazingly easy to use and has immediate access to information thats otherwise hard to find. I would like ratings for more products though, hence the 4 stars"
1586,1586,1,2014-01-13T11:52:25.000Z,Tyghbb,Unimpressed! Will no longer recommend!,"This ""improvement"" took out all the GMO info, vegetarian info etc. and made them subscriptions."
1587,1587,5,2014-03-12T01:18:47.000Z,Pbonnie,Awesome App!,With all the food allergies I have this app is awesome at helping me navigate through the grocery stores. I scan an item and the app lets me know if any of my allergies are in the item. Love love love this app!  Also love the tips and info sent out everyday.  Thanks for the hard work placed in this app!
1588,1588,2,2014-03-14T05:09:46.000Z,ladycheshire5,Liked it before but now you have to pay so much,"I bought this app originally for $5.99 I think it was. Loved it then. One of the best things about it and why I chose this app was because of the GMO checking. Well, I had a hiatus with a samsung phone, came back to iOS and now you have to pay through the nose for every little thing! Disappointed.  I think I'll just go back to MyFitnessPal it's basically the same thing."
1589,1589,5,2014-10-15T14:51:35.000Z,soydelsur82,This app is a wake up call,Amazing app that is helping me so much. I have tried a bunch of stuff to lose weight. They worked but this one is so much easier to use and I love the alternative options it gives you. I 100% recommend it!
1590,1590,5,2011-09-15T20:49:57.000Z,Skippermark,Great program for eating better,"My wife & I have recently started wanting to eat better, and Fooducate has been a huge help in letting us know what's healthy and what's not. It's amazing how things that we thought would be healthy actually aren't.  So glad we found this app."
1591,1591,5,2012-01-05T15:06:26.000Z,hair dressing momma,Awesomeness!!!!,"As a busy mom who makes food for a living, I am always trying to find something to help me save time and stay healthy. this app is AMAZING!!!! The food grade that each item receives was a true eye opener for some things! Great job!!!!! Keep up the good work. I am encouraging all of my chefs peers to use the same app."
1592,1592,4,2012-02-06T10:39:32.000Z,Jdo143,Love!,"I love this app! It is my absolute favorite, I use it all the time! There are a few items I've scanned that are not in the system, however I submit the 3 required pictures they need to add the item in the collection. So please do the same so we can all help this application grow! I would recommend it to anyone. It's a must have!"
1593,1593,5,2012-03-12T05:11:59.000Z,mosmiles,Very helpfully when trying to choose!,"This app is so helpful when you're not quite sure if something is really healthy or when you're stuck between products. Labels can be deceiving, and this food app lays out the good and bad about products."
1594,1594,5,2012-04-06T21:43:45.000Z,JennRomero,Must have this when grocery shopping!!!,Awesome app!  Helps you to make better food choices and know more about what you're eating. Not only gives food a grade but also explains why it got the grade it did.  I highly recommend this app.
1595,1595,3,2012-11-13T04:28:17.000Z,Bluberry Kisses,"Great app, but it keeps crashing","I got this app a while ago, but now when I'm using it most, its harder to use. Sadly, I can't go much further than scanning and alternatives without it crashing when I want to see the product details. Also, what happened to the ""compare"" option? That was so helpful. If these problems were fixed it would be a fantastic app."
1596,1596,5,2016-01-14T04:02:10.000Z,Marci phi,Answer to my prayers,"I am morbidly obese and want to lose weight.  Unfortunately, all the doctors do is send me to Bariatric Surgery. I would really like to do the weight lost the old-fashioned way-with diet and exercise. However, I didn't know what was wrong with my diet and this app told me what I need to know."
1597,1597,5,2016-01-30T19:01:05.000Z,Chicago App Reviewer,Love it! User friendly!,"Assuming the science behind the app is accurate, I love this app! The barcode scanner is a game changer. I have used it so many times at the grocery store to help stir me in the right direction so I 1) limit the unhealthy things I buy 2) look for alternatives the app recommends. Very helpful!"
1598,1598,2,2016-03-24T18:15:03.000Z,Abick1202,Needs to Integrate With other Apps,"I just downloaded this app and was considering switching from my fitness pal, but upon discovering it doesn't even import steps from Apple health or Runkeeper - I'm over it before I even had a chance to get started. It appears as though it should be pulling the steps/workouts in, but it's not. It's a shame because I was really excited about the food grades, but I don't have time to do multiple inputs."
1599,1599,5,2016-11-16T19:05:31.000Z,Slayer5284,I've had more fun,"With this app! I literally wandered around my grocery store comparing things I eat. Next thing I knew it was 2-1/2 hours later. No kidding. I learn a lot every time I use this. I took a hiatus, came back and enjoyed it even more. I highly recommend for nerds and thinkers!"
1600,1600,5,2013-06-23T19:02:11.000Z,October31st,Pretty useful,"Great app. It's helping a lot on my weight loss journey, but some of the foods I eat (which are pretty basic/common) aren't found in their list of options. So I have to go through a little bit more to add my own food and find out all the nutritional info."
1601,1601,5,2013-10-13T21:59:55.000Z,Nikky03pink,Eye opener,"I love this application. It has been an eye opener to go grocery shopping and comparing products to make a decision. I am trying to eat a clean diet and this had been amazing! It has it's limitation that I hope gets fixed, but there is nothing like this out there and regardless, it's amazing!"
1602,1602,5,2013-11-30T02:18:05.000Z,Leidyt,Excellent!!,This is my favorite app to date. It gives me accurate and reliable information to help me make better food choices. I find it to be very informative and up to date. A must have app for those serious about eating better.
1603,1603,4,2013-12-20T19:45:19.000Z,Kmom429,Very nice app!,"I really like this app. Very comprehensive list of items on the market. This is great for weight loss or maintenance. Only downfall is that it is difficult if you make your own meals. You can put it in the system but I have no idea how many calories are in what I made, not the fat or carb percentages. Still love the app and use it all the time!"
1604,1604,5,2014-03-11T06:33:21.000Z,KGP125,Love this app!!!,"I was trying to lose weight with Weight Watchers on my own, but was lying to myself about portion control. With the UPC scanner and database of food items, I can accurately track what I am actually eating or drinking. Thank you for all your hard work to create this app!"
1605,1605,5,2014-06-15T01:50:33.000Z,Snickersdoods,Fantastic App!,This app is wonderful if you want to track what you eat in a day! I had no problem learning it and I am amazed at its features. I highly recommend it if you are trying to lose weight or just trying to eat healthier!
1606,1606,4,2014-06-29T19:09:43.000Z,Brent McDowell,Useful,"Wonderful app, does a great job of explaining which foods are processed and why. Also love the recommendation/ alternatives the app provides. Can be a little too harsh on some foods. Wish it could provide feedback on supplements. Overall, a great app to help choose which foods to buy and why. Fast and easy to use. Definitely Worth downloading."
1607,1607,5,2014-12-13T23:55:22.000Z,MRB80,Love the app,I love the app. As a nursing mom I was put on a dairy restriction for my child. This app has saved me so much time and worry about whether I am eating things that could adversely affect my newborn. This is the second child I've had a dietary restriction and chose to use the this app through. Love it.
1608,1608,4,2015-01-19T01:21:44.000Z,Nikki2Shoes<3,Very helpful and informative app,I've tried other apps like my fitness pal and I find fooducate tons more useful. From the first day tracking my meals and ex resize I was completely wowed. It helps to have an app like this especially for someone who has struggled with weight all of their life. It makes it easier to chose the foods you need.
1609,1609,5,2015-11-19T18:28:54.000Z,Glo2013,Balance,"This is exactly what I need to track and balance my macro nutrients.   After one week, I am better at eating the right balance of carbs/protein/fat.  The food grades are good guideposts, and I find them motivational.   Eating healthy isn't easy, however this app makes it easier."

This app not only tells you what is healthy but also educates you!!! Nice app I would have paid for it!
1611,1611,5,2011-07-04T12:31:39.000Z,Momerohle,My most used app,Very handy to have in the grocery store. Helps with WW points info. I point it at everything because even if you know An item is good the app has extra info and alternatives if you just want to try something different.
1612,1612,5,2011-08-14T17:57:50.000Z,TechAdict,Impressive...,Most impressive :)
1613,1613,5,2012-03-19T03:37:12.000Z,WYO Zumba Girl,Easy to make informed eating choices!,What a handy app. I like to make healthy food choices but sometimes the time it takes to thoroughly read labels and ingredients lists' makes eating healthy a daunting task. With Fooducate I can now can make my food choices at lightning fast speed! Thank you!
1614,1614,5,2012-09-30T08:02:51.000Z,darlenemishelly,"When you don't believe the hype, come here for the real story",I have found this helpful to eliminate and make better choices.  The only thing that would make this better is to ad prices next to items so you can balance health and wealth.
1615,1615,5,2012-12-06T15:02:17.000Z,mrparet90,Insanely helpful.,"I have recently become more aware about what I should and shouldn't be eating to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The trouble for health newcomers like me, however, is learning how to decipher nutrition labels. This app makes it super simple to learn more about a food item before it goes into your cart."

1617,1617,5,2013-03-19T22:38:54.000Z,Fett2010,This app will make you smarter,This app will make you smarter about your food choices. You will at least have a better idea about how to get better food in your body. The explanations are clear and I really like the option to see alternatives.
1618,1618,5,2013-05-02T11:13:42.000Z,Britttttany,Love this app!!,Much better than WW! If you scan something and they don't have it - they add it for you and it goes into their database for everyone to use.  They keep adding features - I highly recommend this app !  I've list over 22 lbs (lowest I've been in 9 years)
1619,1619,4,2013-05-23T14:08:03.000Z,Reboote,Great Tool,"This app is very useful in helping you make smarter food choices. Food choices that I thought were healthy, weren't! It makes me think twice about some of my eating choices because I can see those decisions right on my phone. I haven't used it in the grocery store yet, but am looking forward to it."
1620,1620,4,2010-12-03T20:11:13.000Z,MissMallee,"Amazing, but could use an improvement","I think this is a great app! It shows very basically if it's the best option. But I do think it should include the nutritional facts overview. And as far as the apple comment, the apples have a barcode on the price sticker next to the pile of produce; or you can look up the particular type of apple online."
1621,1621,5,2014-03-19T15:40:25.000Z,Lcbusta8223,Pro version is worth it,"Got the 12 month subscription and there are soooo many more features that are all genuinely useful. You can tailor food grading to your specific needs, like if you want to go vegan or are trying to watch carb intake, etc."
1622,1622,5,2014-03-26T14:09:19.000Z,BarrieFunny,Addicted to this app!,"I used to use another calorie counting app. But I have completely ditched it now to be fooducated! I probably look like a crazy person walking around scanning everything at the grocery store, but I never wanna make an unfooducated decision again!"
1623,1623,5,2014-04-29T22:01:30.000Z,agshane,Easy and convenient,"My have used several of these types of programs.  It is not the best for reporting, but it is extremely quick and easy to get data inputed into the program. Recommend it highly."
1624,1624,5,2014-05-05T01:49:33.000Z,rocho123,The best shopping assistant,"I used the app the other day at the groceries store, and it was much easier than go trough the Nutrition facts or ingredients. Also by using the scanner you see the true ""healthy facts"" of what you are buying. A must have for every organic and healthy freak like me!"

Graded by true actual food vs nonfood stuff, GMO, artificial crud, preservatives, and so forth. What a surprise for a few things I thought were healthy! Great app! My only downside is it is not as smooth as some others I've used. Well worth the upgrade though."
1626,1626,5,2014-07-13T21:25:28.000Z,Auntnewtie,Good tool for losing weight,I have been using this app for a few weeks because I need to track carbs and lose weight.  I have lost 4lbs so far.  It is easy to use - most foods I eat are already entered by other users.  I recommend it.
1627,1627,5,2015-02-20T23:50:19.000Z,VolcomFiji,Great App to Watch What You Eat!!!,This app is awesome!!! While grocery shopping you can just scan your products and figure out how good/bad they are for you. It hasn't been glitchy and seems to have almost every product I scan!!! Love this app!!!
1628,1628,5,2015-09-24T12:33:30.000Z,Blondee444,Know what you are eating!,Best app out there.  If you care what you're eating or are looking for a healthy alternative this is the app for you.  Track you food?  Easy!  Track your exercise? Easy?  Track you're weight loss? Easy?  I've tried them all.
1629,1629,1,2017-05-11T22:54:12.000Z,Otistheman,Awful,"This app used to be great but now it's really bad (were they bought by someone else?). Much slower than it was. Several foods and especially supplements were removed. Even when you input your own stuff it is very limited as to what you can add, just the basics. Used to have more options for adding additional vitamins etc. Too bad, the rating system is about the only thing useful in this anymore. And I'm not sure that alone is enough to continue to use."
1630,1630,4,2013-01-10T00:53:39.000Z,fieldnotes,Love the health tracker,"I love that a health tracker was added in the recent update, I'd like to see this expanded to show more then just calorie and carb intake.  I would find it more beneficial to be able to keep track of the nutrients I'm taking in, and would like to have an app that shows a breakdown of the different vitamins and nutrients that have been consumed."
1631,1631,5,2013-02-10T20:21:01.000Z,ami2420,Easy to use and informative,"I like that you can submit foods for their data bank. I've mostly noticed that it's store brand foods they don't have, or maybe it's just the stores in my area but I can usually find something comparable for now."
1632,1632,4,2013-03-09T18:49:53.000Z,Kjastrero,Opinion and criticism,It's a very fun and interactive app to use when you want to monitor your food. It's very simple and easy to use for all ages! The only criticism I have is they should allow people over the age of 15 because many teens struggle with loosing weight and this I believe would be a good app for those who want to loose weight.
1633,1633,5,2013-03-10T13:31:02.000Z,pbjr696,Great resource!!,There are a lot of new organic products that do not compute. But if we keep sending them in they will get around to getting them on!! They have done a great job and its getting better. I rely on Fooducate more and more.. I'm surprised I have not been thrown out of the market..
1634,1634,5,2013-03-19T22:15:49.000Z,Msharley,This is a Helpful App,"I'm really enjoying this app.  It's hard trying to keep track of what you eat on a daily basis, but this app makes it ""fun"" to keep track of what you eat.  It really helps to keep you motivated to begin to eat healthier and get out and exercise more."
1635,1635,5,2013-05-05T13:19:26.000Z,thecasualty,Great reminder,"This app is a great way to find not only the best foods to eat, but the healthiest brands of each particular food. I like that it puts an emphasis on real and whole foods. This app isn't perfect, but it's a wonderful tool to have and will certainly help you plan a more successful shopping trip."

1637,1637,5,2013-05-24T15:30:51.000Z,KristenMS,Excellent for keeping track of food intake!,It scans almost every product and is really helpful for seeing how many calories you're consuming daily. I just wish it kept a count on protein! Other than that I am thoroughly impressed.
1638,1638,5,2013-07-01T23:24:18.000Z,Walker40,Use this one all the time.,I find myself making better choices with this app and surprised that items I thought were good picks might have better alternatives.   It has a wide range too and I use the food tracker to help with my intake as well.

1642,1642,5,2011-08-30T22:52:47.000Z,Dire_Bear,Just about the best app ever!,This app is amazing for what it does. The only thing that would be better would be if they merged the Fooducate and LoseIt apps together and you could scan in foods to a weight-loss log. But they would have to use the Fooducate database because the LoseIt database is worse.

You would be surprised how many food products pass themselves as healthy eating. Great for finding those little known healthier alternatives to foods you already love. An extremely beneficial tool for dieting.

1649,1649,5,2017-01-08T17:15:43.000Z,review_by_krickit,Best health app out there. . . .,"I used the free version for I few weeks and it was amazing.  I didn't really think it could get much better, but the paid version actually is better. Definitely would recommend this app."
1650,1650,4,2014-01-28T19:46:08.000Z,MCGNC,Eye opener!,This app REALLY made me think about the things im putting into me and my boyfriends bodies! (I do all the cooking) i love how informative the app is and how it really breaks the ingredients down even to how they are made! I was so interested that this has been the ONLY app i have ever paid for EVER I cant wait to see how this changes my eating habits for the better. :)
1651,1651,5,2014-02-02T00:42:06.000Z,NickM1991,Must have app,I cannot eat food without having this app. It scans almost every food item with a barcode and tells you if it's healthy or not. Great for people who not only diet but want to know exactly all the chemicals in your food
1652,1652,4,2014-05-15T16:59:06.000Z,Samkuntry,Awesome app!!!!,I like the app. I found that I didn't use it as much as I thought I would. Logging in everything was kind of a pain. But if your glued to your phone already then there should be no problem.  I'm still looking for the A list foods. What I thought was healthy like raisins were given a C. All in all it's a great app.
1653,1653,5,2014-05-28T22:07:37.000Z,Olbec,I'm sold!,I was a hard sell when first looking at this app as I have used WW in the past and wasn't sure if anything out there was any better... But I'm sold! This is a great app full of solid information. If you use this consistently you will drop the pounds!
1654,1654,4,2015-01-13T22:47:33.000Z,HCassell,Kickstart eating better,"A friend referred this app to me and I love it! It's a great way to begin seeing processed food and real food differently. I'm changing what I buy in the grocery store based on discovering that some of the food I thought was ""healthy"" isn't all it's claims are cracked up to being. It's a good start to a reality check before diving deeper into nutrition."
1655,1655,4,2015-01-29T22:48:18.000Z,Boppib,It's pretty good.,I am paying the monthly premium because I want to see the perks. The GMO information is nice and it's great to see a break down of my meals and what I should be targeting for in terms of iron and calcium etc.
1656,1656,5,2015-06-27T22:54:21.000Z,MaraLillian,Super easy to use!,"Great app, already has helped me in making better food choices. Found it easier to use than other apps and I really like that it shows you what percentage of your diet is processed foods or added sugars, etc."
1657,1657,5,2015-08-24T19:35:29.000Z,serene_shannon,Really helps and is addictive üòä,I really like this app. We are trying to eat more healthy and my kids and I have been having fun scanning food to see its grade. My husband has been skeptical about it but now he looks for the grades that I write on the food :)
1658,1658,5,2016-01-14T23:18:40.000Z,4MommaB,Great App!,I have used this app for about a year now and really like it. I wish under Restaurants we could just type in the name and it would bring up a menu we could click on. Other then that I recommend it.
1659,1659,5,2016-02-10T13:02:15.000Z,Knuckysmom,Love it,"I would give this app 10 stars if I could. It makes keeping up with calories easy. It also, if you are honest with yourself, makes you aware of how many calories you are ACTUALLY consuming versus how many you THINK you are eating."
1660,1660,3,2011-12-05T02:47:02.000Z,Bri1024,Only one problem with the app....,"My whole family loves this app! The only problem is when you have a product that does not get picked up from the scan the app makes you do extra work like, taking a pic of the product and nutritional label, to get nutritional information, but they never once ever told me the results of the products I scanned."
1661,1661,5,2012-01-07T04:15:45.000Z,Peterhiss,Perfect for the health conscious shopper!,I love this app! Once I downloaded it I was scanning everything in sight to see how the foods I usually buy rate. I was very surprised on some and have now taken steps to buy and prepare better food choices for my family. Thank you for such an ingenious app!
1662,1662,3,2012-06-07T03:58:04.000Z,StaMV,Great in theory,"I used to really like this app; after not using it for a couple of months and an apparent upgrade, it remains frozen on the loading screen. I have turned off my phone, exited out of the app multiple times, and patiently waited, to no avail."
1663,1663,5,2012-11-07T00:40:52.000Z,NapaValleyVegan,Love it!,"I found myself scanning everything in my kitchen and I've told all of my friends. This is an app that you really need to have. It is so helpful in making better & healthier food choices. Depending on our choices, food can cure us or kill us!"
1664,1664,5,2012-12-14T03:58:42.000Z,slyon,Perfect,"Quick and easy to use at home or in a store. Shortens time reading confusing labels and lays all out all information you could possibly want to know about the product, even warns you when a product may be made with GMO's."
1665,1665,4,2013-04-30T13:18:25.000Z,Silver Hare,"Good, but would like to see more facts","When using the health tracker, at the end of the day it would be nice if it had a list of all the nutrient percentages so you can know how much or how little you consumed. Right now it just has your bare minimum of carbs, fat, calories, and protein. I would like to see more details, such as calcium, iron, fiber, and so on."
1666,1666,3,2013-09-01T12:24:24.000Z,Avid-reader,Multiple ratings for same product,I was looking up the rating for Krave Chocolate cereal and was pleasantly surprised at the B- rating. I proceeded to read the review on it and was confused to see a screenshot showing a lower rating. So I conducted a second search and noticed 5 different reviews of the same product with 3 different ratings ranging from B- to C-. Makes you question the reliability of the ratings.
1667,1667,5,2013-10-10T02:21:08.000Z,James T. SteeLe,The most effective fitness app.,To make changes in your fitness level you really have to know what you're eating. This app takes a lot of guesswork out of your questionable food items and is hard proof for people who try to live in denial.
1668,1668,5,2013-12-12T01:44:17.000Z,Slothxfoot,Amazing,I use this app daily! I scan everything now. It's definitely helped me to rethink what I'm eating and drinking and has helped me to discover new foods and brands of food.  Love that you can submit new finds and they will add what you send in to their database. The scan contests are fun too.
1669,1669,4,2014-01-23T02:48:30.000Z,katgon3,For Beginner and Seasoned Food Trackers,"This app is great! Fairly easy to learn and start using quickly. I do get a bit aggravated when I can't find a specific food or my foods won't scan. Hopefully, the ones I've sent in for Fooducate to enter into the system will be in there soon. I do believe it's worth the money, though."
1670,1670,5,2011-04-14T17:37:15.000Z,LNWEsq3,Fantastic Application,"This is a wonderful and informative app.  I downloaded it last night and have already told three people about it. I agree that the scanning is addictive, but it's worth it in that you may be surprised as to what you find.  Great work on this app!!!"
1671,1671,5,2011-05-31T02:38:59.000Z,Mevert03,Excellent resource,"This has really helped me make better choices, before I buy. I love the alternatives tab, the warnings, and the fact that the database has almost everything I've scanned. It is also very easy to submit new products."
1672,1672,5,2011-07-22T00:18:59.000Z,Aggie1978,Fudulove it!,Use it all the time while shopping. Very handy app.. You don't have to spend so much time studying the labels just scan the product and if you don't like what you're scanning look at the alternatives the app is recommending instead. Great feature!
1673,1673,4,2011-08-10T23:48:12.000Z,sarahmuffin,Fantastic app,"This is exactly what apps are made for! Organized, useful information that is easy to access and helpful to the goal of eating right. My only qualm is that products with artificial sweetners receive high health grades, and I find that questionable. But I know the research there is inconclusive, so one can't complain too much. Thank you for a great app!"
1674,1674,5,2011-08-26T16:59:23.000Z,beachykeen254,I LOVE IT.,"It's definitely my FAVORITE app! It's such a fantasic idea and it really helps you eat healthier. You think certain products are healthy because they are  advertised to seem like it, but once you use Fooducate you realize it's not so the app gives you healthier alternatives. I'm so suprised this app is FREE!"
1675,1675,5,2011-09-12T20:53:19.000Z,Choliefish,Wow!,"Well, I have only had this app for five minutes and have scanned my whole kitchen!!  So easy, so cool and so informative. This is going to be my go-to when making food decisions in the store. (I already have made a few changes to my shopping list)"

1677,1677,5,2011-11-02T22:01:18.000Z,SkeeterPi,So helpful!,I try to feed my family the healthiest options and this app helps SO MUCH! I love being able to look up an item and see what's in it or the next best choice. I've already made several changes to our weekly grocery trips!
1678,1678,5,2011-11-13T15:06:48.000Z,BC livermore,Good for the whole fam!,I love it ! The one thing I wish it has was were you could find the possible better choices.  (what stores might carry them)
1679,1679,5,2011-11-28T03:48:56.000Z,OrangeSox02021,Very informative,"I don't know where they get their information or how accurate it really is, but the app gives tons of interesting info that cannot be found on labels. I watch what my family eats and stay quite informed, but this app has taught me a lot!"
1680,1680,5,2011-04-14T02:31:49.000Z,Buzzybee1014,Amazing and High impact,Fantastic app that provides plain English nutrition information and even provides suggestions for healthy alternatives within the same product category. This app has the capacity to improve public health and nutrition and is fun and very easy to use.
1681,1681,3,2015-06-16T16:57:03.000Z,clkinla,Recent updates lowered quality,"I have the iPhone 6 plus, and recent Fooducate updates resulted in a super tiny font making the app difficult to see. I emailed them directly about this nearly two months ago and was reassured they are working in it. Database is still lacking. I'm a premium member and don't feel like it is worth paying for."
1682,1682,5,2015-10-19T03:17:15.000Z,Chelseab555,Love it!!,While this app doesn't have every food item known to man it does have a lot! My boyfriend and I just scanned every item in our house anything that was rated below a B was tossed. This app not only rates the items but explains how it was rated. Very helpful learning tool!

I now know how to eat healthy-eat the food my body deserves, and I've become so committed to this new healthy life of mine. Fooducate gave me such a great foundation and knowledge about how to perpetuate all of this! best app ever invented"

I also like that it does the calories consumed vs calories expended and puts it in an easy to understand summary.
1685,1685,5,2016-05-18T15:58:36.000Z,AladdinH,Great app,"Great app. Really like the Food grades and points, as well as the detailed info and the substitutes."

Its helping me track what's beyond my calorie intake by giving me an EXTENSIVE evaluation on the foods I eat and what's in it. The features are easy to use and enjoyable and the community is supportive ^_^
1687,1687,4,2017-02-19T17:04:10.000Z,FL_S,Helpful and good experience,"Tried another app before with nice results however this one seems to be one of top ones around. It needs little improvement to the meal/food search and addition to meals. Also it would be great to be able to list foods that scored most for carbs, fat and protein. Very good app indeed."
1688,1688,5,2017-04-19T20:01:32.000Z,Daddy Bobbie,Keeps crashing,"The app looks great, and I really want to use it, but it won't even open. It keeps crashing. Quite upsetting, I'm hoping this can be fixed so I can use the app"
1689,1689,5,2017-05-08T23:02:23.000Z,Freddy114,Best app to eat healthy,This app is great for checking if food is healthy or not. It shows you the the things that aren't required to be listed but are very harmful for you. Best way to compare food to see what's healthier. Also has good tips and alternatives for eating healthy.

I changed my habits and made new ones. I tell everyone I know to download. They are shocked when they scan their supposedly ""healthy"" things they like."

Yet I still get a notification to ""Please log your meals. Even a few is fine."" ...EVEN A FEW IS FINE?! Uninstall. You've got to be kidding me. A meal logger is a great option for those doing so to lose weight (or track food's effect on a health problem), but that notification out of the blue is just encouraging disordered eating. F you."

I like that you can send the app the nutrition info but, it take a long time for them to put the information in. I would like to see the app updated with the ability to put in our on nutrition information for it to be more convenient."
1694,1694,5,2014-05-10T01:48:50.000Z,AuntJoJo517,Love it,"Still learning the ropes. But so far so good. Learned a lot in one day about the foods I've been eating. I wish I could list the ingredients to my own recipes and then have it do the calories and grading for me but that's ok, it's giving me a chance to brush up on my math skills."

I was surprised about some of the reviews (Oreos were given a C, which is high I'm my opinion), but it's still really cool how they break down why they think a food I healthy or not. Overall, Great app for extra nutritional help!"
1701,1701,5,2011-09-23T03:06:13.000Z,CI32,Very useful app,"I use it often when I have to pick a product and I have some doubts about it's healthiness, and in most cases I put it back on the shelf. It is also a way to build healthy eating habits if you are ready to give up some 'good' (in taste only) food."
1702,1702,5,2011-10-19T04:05:27.000Z,DogLover2113,Excellent!,This app is awesome! I've even wrote them an email and the responded and updated with my suggestion.

1709,1709,5,2013-05-16T21:56:29.000Z,Slamadrama,Mom,I love that this app gives me alternative choices. I can make small changes and be healthier. I had no idea some of the things I was eating were full of sugar and/or GMO's. The cottage cheese I was eating was one of the worst in its category. I switched brands and I actually like the taste better! Love this app!

By that I mean the writers use funny and strong and sometimes exaggerated words to describe everything but in a good way that makes you want to keep reading
1715,1715,5,2015-01-08T02:49:23.000Z,Isaac's Mamaw,Fooducate,Great app!  I use it to track my food. I've lost 25 lbs with no exercise.

What I love about this app is that it gives me an idea of what exactly is going into my body. The healthier alternatives that appear in the same category of what I scan is probably my favorite feature.

So they quietly tracked us before Apple respected ""some"" of our privacy, and now apps can't freely track like they did in the past?!  Their paid version has not updated to the registration version YET.  Perhaps this company wants to see how offended users of this program are before requiring it in the Plus version.  Let them know!!!"
1724,1724,5,2012-08-22T21:43:55.000Z,80skitty,Love but weird people on comments,"Love this app! Has so many foods on list. The points match up to weight watchers, at least from what I have used."

My favorite thing about the app is the alternative suggestions! You can easily spend an hour in a store scanning everything...addicting!"
1726,1726,5,2013-03-24T20:14:45.000Z,mexquisite,Helpful app,A quick and easy way to learn more about what you're eating.  it gives you the rationale of why foods earn any given rating and it also offers helpful alternatives.  It also lets you know if something is vegetarian or vegan.

Lets you know why a product is healthy or unhealthy and gives great alternatives. Not too wordy with the explanations, so there's no chance I feeling overwhelmed with scientific vocab"
1728,1728,4,2014-02-03T19:04:01.000Z,2manpgy,Some changes would help,This App is helping me to stay on track.  Very helpful tips.  I would like to see you add a recipe calculator.  I would also like to be able to delete things from my food list because scrolling through everything is time consuming.
1729,1729,5,2014-02-13T17:23:25.000Z,aflygirl,Easy,This is a great app that is very easy to use and navigate. The scanning feature makes it so easy to input the food you eat and if it's not on file the auto update email feature makes it easy to add new items.

It's an awesome app with a supportive community but some people are too up tight! They say oh no your tooooo young. Well we're not for your info! And if you stick to eating healthy this app can really help you!
1737,1737,5,2015-09-18T01:31:46.000Z,Liztodd6,Love this so far!,Really like this app so far! I always thought I are relatively healthy--not the case.

It is nice to see pictures of the food that I have entered. When I emailed them for support, they responded quickly. Its nice that one can subscribe  monthly, annually or buy it for $75."

I also have a problem with glitches. But it's an extremely useful tool that focuses not only on weight loss, but the quality and details of your foods and brands."
1742,1742,4,2014-02-04T23:29:06.000Z,Mdhaughton,Food knowledge = better choices.,I like the fact that a lot of the food items are graded A to E...healthy to not healthy.  It is the aspect that makes fooducate stand out from other apps.  You have the ability to look for healthier choices...see how your food divides out into carbohydrates fats and proteins...great app

Watching what I eat with the app and running I've met my goal!!! I'm now eating at 1400 calories a day and I'm not starving :)

When I have an extra moment, I re-scan my food with this app for excellent education, advice. If you use both, make sure to DISABLE Apple Health connectivity from Fooducate so you don't get duplicate data"

What this program does would take me hours to accomplish manually. Great for all you Weight Watchers out there, this gives Points Plus numbers."

Of those, the alternatives suggested were never products available in my state, let alone my town. Basically, if you have a Trader Joe's or a Whole Foods in your area, you might find this app useful. If you shop seemingly anywhere else, it's a waste of time."

1765,1765,2,2015-03-05T14:47:41.000Z,Kathyspeih,Food shaming/scare tactics overdrive,I think it can be a great tool for people with a nutrition background. Should be avoided for people in recovery from eating disorders.  Large amounts of misinformation without solid scientific backing.  I feel it does a great deal of food shaming. Not the most user friendly either. Difficult to track in a hurry.  I love the idea but I feel it's going to far in the wrong direction to be a realistically useful tool for the general population.
1766,1766,5,2015-04-17T00:57:18.000Z,judyj55,I'm really enjoying the Fooducate app,This is very easy to use and I'm learning new things even the first day. I would like to be able to see the food points as I'm progressing thru the day as opposed to only at night when I finish.

The app helps me explain why I won't buy certain food-like substances for them. I told them I'd buy anything B or better. I won't take a C from you in school and I won't take a C home to eat ;)

1786,1786,5,2013-02-03T14:32:28.000Z,David1st,Gray App,Incredibly useful in regard to eating healthy.  This app cuts through the claims or inferences of foods that companies promote as healthy and are actually not.  The app also provides healthy alternatives to specific items that may not be healthy or conducive to weight loss.  Easy and fun to use.

I have been reading ingredient labels for years and really understand only a few. Fooducate covers the rest and will really open your eyes to what your mouth is eating."

But I'm already somewhat educated about nutrition and reading labels. I find the results repetitive, the background info not very thorough and the assessment  sometimes not accurate (i.e. hydrogenated oil was indicated as a reason for a poor grade but no such oil was in the product). Could do more with this app."

Only thing I wish they'd add would be a button where you can say ""I ate this today"" and it would keep a log for you.

I took off one star for a bit too much bread ing, but they also seem to have much more fish than most. The fish is tasty and moist if not over-cooked.

With one Caveat,"I love everything about all inclusive food lifestyle app. The only thing that is keeping it @ 4 stars is their turn around time on user submitted  food label reports (for missing items). It's so long that I may suspect that they have, in fact, simply stopped adding in user submitted items."
1799,1799,5,2017-07-04T17:24:18.000Z,MrsHerrod04,This app is all that!!,"Thank you for creating! I've been using this app for about 5 days and I'm already down 5 pounds with using this app to keep up with calories I intake, eating clean, and educating myself on what I'm putting in my body. FYI mostly eating paleo. This app rocks!!"
1800,1800,5,2013-08-13T10:05:12.000Z,MxGena,Everyone needs this app.,This app tells a lot of shocking information and great information about foods and drinks we are eating everyday.  Everyone knows whats in items are putting in our bodies. This will help everybody to start eating right.
1801,1801,3,2013-09-04T03:19:21.000Z,MMayo3,Shady Upgrade!,"At first I loved this app! It helped me set a goal, monitor my calories and carbs, and worked really well with my diet/fitness program. I got halfway to my goal and suddenly I have to pay 4.99 for an 'upgrade' so it will continue to track my carbs. Feeling a little hoodwinked. Think I'm going to check out some of the other apps my doctor recommended."
1802,1802,3,2013-09-19T18:53:44.000Z,drjean,Lookin' good...,This looks like one I will buy once they have the food bank updated!  (And out of 70 apps I have only purchased one!). It is so easy to keep track of what I am eating and what calorie count to go each day!  I am handicapped and cannot always cognitate üòÆüòÉ..I was mischievously surprised when it automatically adjusted down my daily allowance due to weight loss!
1803,1803,5,2014-04-14T22:49:14.000Z,J. A. S,Love this app!,Found this app in a mag. While look through it. I was curious so I download it. I love it. It's great. It has almost ever food on it and if not u can add it. I fill myself on it a lot looking forward to the day results. Very easy to use. Love the little tips too!
1804,1804,1,2014-07-22T03:31:48.000Z,SoftPink,So I loved this until,"Things got different. I don't know what happened but not my health tracker when adding food only shows carb intake on the top and when I go to look at my health tracker it won't load. I'm so annoyed because I really loved this app but now since I can't see my day I will use something different. All I want is a simple log, if I could fix it to where I had my calories on the top like before and able to see my log I'll use it again"
1805,1805,5,2014-10-13T22:38:12.000Z,GolfaChick,Love it!,I love this app because it tells you what is in your food and what your actually eating! I also love how it scans your food instantly and that its really easy to use! I also enjoy that it tracks your progress! Totally worth getting!
1806,1806,5,2014-12-27T04:29:54.000Z,Wes2826,Healthy App,Great app for eating better. It's actually kind of fun to bum around the store and scan different items to see their health grade. Includes great nutritional info. Easy to scan the items you eat to track your daily nutritional intake.
1807,1807,5,2015-02-14T14:55:39.000Z,Cugath,More than helpful!!!!,"This app is a lot of help to compare different foods/snacks to see which are healthier. It gives descriptions, nutrition facts, as well as healthy alternatives to most foods. I recommend getting this app, especially if you're a nutrition freak like me ;)"
1808,1808,4,2015-04-22T00:37:58.000Z,Onlygurl,Great app for tracking,I really think this app is awesome it's great if you want to keep track of you food and exercise! It also gives a grade on the food you eat so you can even start to pick better options. It also counts calories what more can you ask for

Not trying to diet, just look at what I'm eating to help make better decisions! East to use. I like the activity tracker as well."
1810,1810,4,2012-02-05T00:20:48.000Z,Altmatics,A great guide,"I would give this 5 stars but sometimes the criteria for rating is hard to derive. For example, Trader Joe's turkey jerky gets a C+ but all that seems to be at issue is the ""all natural"" label. And that isn't even listed as a negative: it's marked merely as ""information."" A clearer explanation for what attributes contribute to a rating and how they are weighted would be helpful."
1811,1811,5,2012-08-17T22:33:11.000Z,Twebbs318,Great app to teach kids to eat right.,"I love this app, what a smart idea. My kids are grown but if I had this when they were young I would hand them my phone in the store and tell them they couldn't buy any thing that wasn't a ""B"" or better."
1812,1812,1,2012-10-06T12:10:59.000Z,Unrealistic Grading,Oreos,"I deleted this app after seeing that Oreos had a grade of B. Several Fooducate members posted their excitement that Oreos ""were good for you."" This doesn't seem like reliable information. I was sad to see how many people said Oreos are a great healthy snack for their children. Feed your kids the occasional cookie, but don't walk around thinking that they are nutritious. In this case, Fooducate is perpetuating the idea that you can eat crap and be healthy. Fruits and vegetables are good snacks for kids, not cookies. Good luck everyone."

It gives lots of good information on all kinds of food. It does a whole lot more...I haven't used it to it's full potential.

This app helps me right in the grocery store and many times gave me good feedback on what I thought was healthy.  I've scanned my pantry! So much fun!"

I especially like the ""vegetarian"" option - I haven't found that in other food apps. Thank you fooducate!"
1818,1818,5,2013-05-31T18:50:14.000Z,Sct1993,Fantastic!,I would highly recommend this app to anybody. It allows you to be aware of so many variables in your diet from GMO foods to helping you lower your blood pressure. This is the best app of this kind I have ever used. To the developers: thank you and keep up the great work!
1819,1819,5,2013-06-16T13:43:18.000Z,MindyS.,Great app!,This app has been awesome! The scanner has been awesome for helping to make healthier choices while grocery shopping and it also makes it super easy to keep track of your calories and points to help with weight management. Love it!

A HUGE timesaver and resource for folks on the WW points plus program. Just scan...no calculator needed for many, many items! Don't even think twice... Just download it right now :-)"

1824,1824,5,2011-12-31T20:10:38.000Z,EJHamill,Best App!,This is such an amazing app! I recommend it to all of my friends! Takes all of the guess work out of deciphering nutrition facts! Makes grocery shopping a breeze when trying to choose the more healthy option on the shelf!
1825,1825,5,2012-01-14T22:30:26.000Z,dannyychong,Informational,"Gives a lot of information. Interpret the information on your own as you deem relevant. It has a lot of popular food items. But if something is missing, you can just take 3 photos of it and they will add it to the database.  Great for a free app."
1826,1826,5,2015-04-09T18:12:34.000Z,Lexysview,Mucho Bueno!!,This App not only gives you insight by breaking down the processed food we may enjoy and gives alternatives . It also helps you keep you in check by allowing you to keep track of your daily caloric intake . So cool !
1827,1827,5,2015-06-05T17:46:45.000Z,Bbbbbbbjjjjjj,Life changer,"I just started using this app, but for the week I've had it, it's opened my eyes to the amount of food I was eating. I'm sure with this and a little exercise I'm going to lose the weight in trying to lose. Great app"
1828,1828,5,2015-07-05T14:40:53.000Z,CJBabs88,Hard to Please,"This is by far the best nutrition app I have ever downloaded. Not only does it allow me track what I am eating, my exercise and Weightloss, it tells me what exactly is in my food (GMOs, additives and controversial ingredients)."

1831,1831,5,2012-10-20T23:23:04.000Z,J Rob,Absolutely a go-to,This a wonderful app to use at the grocery store. So many products are marketed for the health conscious but really are no better than their counter parts. It's nice to really get accurate and key facts to help my family develop and maintain healthier eating habits.
1832,1832,3,2013-02-19T03:27:50.000Z,Userjahshsh,"Pretty good, will be better as database grows...",Really easy to use convenient app.  Big drawback is no alcohol nutritional.  Also would be useful if you could create a list of regular foods and be able to select from that each day and week what you eat.  Fast food from the chains would also be useful.  Overall best food / health monitoring app I've seen.
1833,1833,4,2013-03-12T19:45:13.000Z,Bhenry5,Great app!,"I find this application very helpful in understanding what's in what I am eating. It's helping me to make better choices, take better care of myself, to live longer for myself and family. I like the fact I can simply scan the barcode to get the quick nutrition facts on it.

1834,1834,5,2013-03-31T11:59:37.000Z,Jrsunflowers,Sweetness!,This is a wonderful app!  It helps me keep track of my daily intake of calories and exercise!  I can customize it to fit my needs and it even reminds me very few hours to plug in what I have eaten!  I highly recommend this program!
1835,1835,5,2014-03-25T02:41:59.000Z,LuLu Philly,Loveeee this app!,This app is great. The scanner I use daily when food shopping and I love the health tracker. Being a vegan I can track my proteins along with fiber and carbs. It's easy to use. The emails and updates on brands recipes and articles about products is also great
1836,1836,5,2014-05-05T13:03:05.000Z,kevslidetunes,Exceeds expectations!,I downloaded another app but this app is much more powerful. I'm still learning the features. Like the grading system . Found out how much junk is in our cupboards. My wife will be using this for shopping.
1837,1837,5,2014-06-12T01:05:34.000Z,KaitlinMurphy,Fun!,"Scanning food items makes this app fun! I like how foods get letter grades because it makes it easy to chose healthier items. You can add your own food items that aren't already programmed in there, but a lot of goods are! Definitely a great app."
1838,1838,5,2014-08-05T07:16:49.000Z,Fat Steven,One of my most used apps!,Fooducate shows me how to choose better food. I must have upgraded at least 50 products since I started using this app last year. Went up from a C- average to a B+.
1839,1839,5,2015-01-15T17:43:10.000Z,Itsmedani,LOVE the simplified home screen,"I love the new simplified home screen, the previous version was too much and deterred me from using the app for what I love most; scanning and browsing food to see its rating. Happy with the new change. Thank you Fooducate!"
1840,1840,4,2011-04-15T16:32:59.000Z,MSPJohn,Pretty Good - Needs a Couple Things,Needs to have serving size info...maybe toggle to that when you click on Calories.  This can be highly misleading on many packages.  We both started Weight Watchers recently. FoodPoints seems to be very similar to WW's PointsPlus. Maybe Fooducate can convince WW to embed their tool in WW's eTools. Otherwise a very useful and helpful app.
1841,1841,5,2011-05-16T16:50:13.000Z,Vitanione,Wonderful resource,"Learning about your food products has never been easier then this! With a wide array of items, expanding constantly, this easy to use app helps you get a handle on the food you eat every day!"
1842,1842,5,2011-06-29T00:38:46.000Z,Zif13,Great app!,My only complaint is how much longer my shopping trips are because I want to scan EVERYTHING! :) I love the amount of input we have and I appreciate all of the little details about what makes an item healthy or not-so.

1844,1844,4,2011-09-05T13:31:30.000Z,Scottso,One of the most practical apps!,App works well and the scanner is excellent.  I find some of the food conclusions I do not agree with especially when ingredients are not considered on their own merit.  Overall a great guide when shopping that everyone who desires to eat healthier should use.  Highly recommended.
1845,1845,5,2011-11-15T05:19:08.000Z,Hounderjp,Great ap for all,"This is a great ap for all users and very useful to know about what your eating. Dont get frustrated about them not having certain products they will add them, there are too many to put on over night! Be patient its great."
1846,1846,5,2011-11-27T22:05:31.000Z,Rachel18452957,Very useful,Alerts me to hidden stuff like bpa and other tricky substances hiding in foods I previously thought were safe. Quick way to discover things like refined grains masquerading as whole grains and trans fats that go unnoticed due to the labeling loopholes. And it's free. Everyone needs to get this essential app.
1847,1847,5,2011-12-19T14:24:36.000Z,carolann210,Wonderful tool at the grocery store,"I love this app, I use it at the store and won't buy anything less than a B for my 10 month old. Gives me the confidence I need to know I making the right decisions in selecting food for my baby."

1849,1849,5,2012-01-28T19:35:06.000Z,Bike Guru,Changed what I buy at the store,"This is an awesome app! As soon as I downloaded it, I went into my fridge, started scanning, checked the healthier alternatives, created a healthy shopping list, BAM! Simple as that. Being healthy starts with the food you buy."
1850,1850,5,2014-05-13T16:44:31.000Z,Lebog101,Impressive,"So far, so good. I've only used it for a few days. But so far I'm thrilled. The only challenge I see for its long term success is the discipline necessary to build and maintain the habit of use. But if you do your part, the app will do its part."
1851,1851,1,2015-05-15T08:32:21.000Z,TexasUSofA,Completely Disgusted ‚ùóÔ∏è,I paid for the pro version of the Fooducate app thinking it would be useful and factual information.  I was clearly mistaken!  They have no problem with listing items as non GMO even though they contain GMO's.  What is worse is that even after they have been informed and supplied the information from the companies they still just leave it incorrectly documented.  This is not an app to trust when it comes to you and your families health!  Beware!
1852,1852,5,2015-08-27T17:07:21.000Z,Greatly perfect,Holds you accountable,I love the app because it makes you write down everything you eat in a day. It's easy to use do there isn't excuse.  I only need to loose 5 pounds but those are the hardest.  This apps keeps me accountable to what I put in my mouth.
1853,1853,5,2016-01-08T01:33:11.000Z,Bmhz92,Love this app,"I love fooducate! It's seriously AMAZING! I haven't used it in years but just got it again and it is fabulously upgraded! It rates foods to let you know how good or bad they are, gives you healthier alternative suggestions for foods you like, has a recipe section, and MORE! So great!!!"
1854,1854,4,2016-03-17T05:23:13.000Z,swagr,Good App!,"I bought the pro for a year. This unlocked amazing benefits. I love that each item I record gets the rating.

1859,1859,1,2017-06-06T14:40:54.000Z,modellife,Very expensive. And not worth it.,"So if you don't like this app they are not able to reimburse you. And when you select the in app purchase they charge for a full year, not month by month. So I just paid 24$ for an app that I am deleting because it's too confusing and too difficult to use. And the recipes are just full of fattening gross food. What kind of food educating are you doing with recipes chalk full of butter and cheese ... soooo disappointed."
1860,1860,4,2012-09-30T09:28:09.000Z,Sander Rubn,Nice but needs improvements,"A nice app with one reservation.  Scanner (iPod touch w/cam) is slow and unreliable compared, e.g., to RedLaser.  Needs some improvements."

1862,1862,4,2013-01-10T16:05:02.000Z,Jennifer Sullivan,Love this app.,"Having the reminder really keeps me honest. I do wish it had restaurant foods included (I switch to Eat This,Not That) and I get stumped if my hubby cooks and I don't know the brands he used in a recipe. I am finding that I'm actually eating fewer calories than I need to, which may be why I've been tired."

Some stuff I scanned were not in system which was frustrating.  It really shows how processed most if our foods are--even the ""healthy"" and ""light"" ones.  Very useful app."

So I pay less attention to the ""grade"" given and more attention to the other info provided, which I think is fantastic!!! Thank you for creating this app."

1874,1874,5,2011-10-03T01:21:05.000Z,PitaKitty,Amazing!!,"This app is awesome!  It really opens my eyes to a lot of the preservatives and such that are put into foods that one would normally consider healthy!  And I love the ""foodpoints""!  It makes grocery shopping much easier when I don't have to figure it out myself."
1875,1875,5,2011-10-22T13:20:33.000Z,ask4080,Everyone needs this app!,"I knew I wasn't always eating the healthiest foods, but fooducate really put into perspective just how unhealthy some of my choices were.  I'll never buy anything again without a fooducate barcode scan!"

1877,1877,5,2011-11-11T18:19:49.000Z,Zaffra,Really helpful,"I love the info about the products. It's great that you can find alternatives, and the app tells you what if anything is wrong with the food. Not sure if the points are the same as Weight Watchers, but it is still helpful."
1878,1878,5,2011-12-31T11:58:28.000Z,Pcgrad,Great App,Really helps to make smarter choices when grocery shopping and deciding between products. Demystifies the nutritional info for you and gives fact on things you might not take into consideration normally.

1881,1881,5,2011-05-19T20:27:32.000Z,leharris,New Grocery Store Buddy!,Super easy & the perfect app for daily grocery store goers like myself. Now I don't have to waste precious time comparing labels aisle after aisle. And if there's not a product page for an item take 3 pics from your phone & send them in. It's genius!

1883,1883,5,2011-07-06T07:39:57.000Z,RaechelSoicher,Nice little app,I don't use this in the grocery store. I usually just compare the labels on boxes of similar items. But I love the share feature and also the little contests. I also love sending in info to update the app for other users.

My recommendation for anyone who wants to lose weight is to have measuring cups, measuring spoons and a food scale to make the process easier. üëç"
1889,1889,3,2017-04-19T02:46:00.000Z,Abbybitchxo,Love it but Needs bug fix,"My only problem is that I have to clear all my other apps before I open this or it will crash. However This app is really helpful, it has so many ways to customize it just for you! It even gives you grades on the food you eat and tells you what's really in it."
1890,1890,5,2013-04-21T08:48:33.000Z,Dertiy Devil,The future of grocery shopping!,This is an enormous step forward for the NON GMO movement! It's user friendly format is amazing for those moments when you grab something off the shelf that you aren't sure if it is verified NON-GMO (genetically modified organisms). It's amazing. So happy that this exists.

I just want to know better than product labels what's in my food and the harmful effects. I uninstalled this app as soon as I found out what a money generator it is for the developers. You could spend up to $175 a year (more if you subscribe monthly) if you wanted to take advantage of every module. I'll do my research on the web thank you very much!"
1895,1895,5,2014-02-04T13:16:42.000Z,Appald,Favorite awesome app,Love this app and it is part of my daily routine! Reviewed before as great but you went over the top!

1898,1898,3,2014-06-30T22:43:54.000Z,Hum no,Useful tool,"Shows important qualities of food. Has a narrow view of what people need to eat at times. Tired of my high fiber foods being downgraded for one percent over Someone else's ideals.  Most of all the paragraphs on details of food's ingredients are repetitive, and says nothing about the food you are looking up. Reminds me of old horoscopes in the news paper."
1899,1899,4,2015-01-30T23:47:17.000Z,nplazio,Good app,"This App works as described. There are still quite a few foods that need to be captured on the Apps list, but between scanning the barcodes and the ability to enter your own food nutritional facts, the app works well. I purchased a lifetime support, but I'm not sure that that is necessary for most people."
1900,1900,5,2012-03-09T16:02:32.000Z,Lcbked,Fantastic Application,Both my daughter and I love this app. It has really changed our food selections. We thought we were healthy eaters and learned that small changes in our selections made a huge difference in our health.

1909,1909,4,2013-03-28T14:07:40.000Z,Tlnissen,Great App,I really like this app and love the fact that it has the barcode scanner. Only problem is I can't get the function for creating a custom food to work. The app gives clear instructions on how to do this but it just doesn't work for me. Other than that its great!
1910,1910,5,2011-07-06T22:25:39.000Z,Jazzknee,Sp. Ed. Teacher,Love this app! Especially love the fact they have at least 5 other suggestions of a better product if the one you are researching comes up short on the grading scale. I have told many people about this great app and they love it too!

They also love to use it in the grocery store. Of course I love it, but the biggest perk for me is how it's helped my kids open their eyes to what they are eating."
1914,1914,5,2011-08-13T18:18:44.000Z,Kiddogal,Excellent app!,Easy to use & I like that it will give healthier alternatives to what you have scanned. I also like that if a product isn't in the database then take a picture of it & they will email once that product is entered.

1918,1918,3,2011-12-05T21:18:42.000Z,Cory de,Concerned American,"I like this app for the most part.  I don't agree that foods with aspartame, food coloring, or high fructose corn syrup, should be given anything higher than a D or F rating.  It is proven fact that these things are very bad for you.  I would appreciate it if you would tell us if something is made with GMO (genetic modified organisms), for this has also been proven to be VERY bad for us."
1919,1919,5,2017-06-04T13:13:54.000Z,RocknRoseJen,It helps if you stick to it,"Like with many things, if you stick to it and continue to use the apps many benefits, it can help you toward your goal. I love the recipe feed, diet tidbits as well as how user-friendly this app is!"

If determined,"The healthier you eat, the easier it is to use this app. I mean it's difficult to calculate exact calories of a fried meal that you prepare yourself, whereas a sandwich or a salad that you can add as a single serving then save it as a meal later on. Love this app!"

But other than that, it's pretty amazing! Plus it's free, so why not get it and eat healthier?"
1931,1931,5,2011-11-15T01:17:48.000Z,PHRAYSURE,I use it all the time!,"Fooducate will probably end up saving my life. I use it everywhere. Literally, I will stand in a store aisle scanning everything until I find a healthy alternative. For example, did you know that reduced fat peanut butter is a C+ while regular is a B?"

I don't like the network issues I experience every time I'm in the store, and very often the items are not yet in the database, but when they are it's extremely helpful!"

Also they don't tell you how the score is decided. For example for me, sugar is something I'm more conscious about but calories isn't. But over all pretty good!"
1935,1935,5,2012-08-08T17:13:26.000Z,j_levy718,Great app,Helps you make healthier eating choices. Extremely helpful since most product labels in stores are misleading and allow you to think the product is healthy when it's really not.

1940,1940,5,2011-07-03T23:31:22.000Z,Aglass,Very useful app!,This app is great for learning about what is actually in your food. It goes in depth on all the scientific terms that no one really knows what they are. Makes you think twice about all the food you thought was good for you!

If you're going by points it's a little harder to find the point breakdown for each food. Major flaw for me is the lack of fresh produce in the database compared to the plethora of trader joe branded food. For example, it has no nutritional data for a fresh nectarine but has plenty of processed juices to chose from."

2008,2008,2,2013-01-08T14:43:39.000Z,CMSJPM,Meh,"It's okay, but it is annoying that you cannot easily edit foods and exercises in the health tracker.  For instance, if I eat an orange in the morning and then have another in the evening then I have to add it again rather than edit my first entry to 2.  In addition, the proportion options are limited to 15 minute increments on exercise and .5 increments on food.  Very limiting, especially if you eat a lot of fresh foods and cook at home."

2033,2033,5,2012-12-24T19:58:40.000Z,KRJacobs07,True Food Education,This app will help you to take charge of what you are putting in your body.  What you don't know you'll discover by a simply scan of the barcode.  Invest in yourself by investing in this app.
2034,2034,5,2013-02-01T21:52:39.000Z,Hezuschristo,Very useful,"Although most of the database is made up of foods you can scan, it still has a ton of foods. It allows you to count calories based on serving size and portions. I love it for my food categorizing/calories needs."
2035,2035,5,2013-02-10T14:25:11.000Z,Manchester_NH,.,"Great app, scans nicely, explains clearly, offers better food options, easy to add add'l products... ""Make-Your-Own"" recipes are nice... Has helped me make better food choices... Thank You!"
2036,2036,4,2013-03-04T00:08:12.000Z,Rsquared1382,Fooducated!!,I really enjoy this app even though it still seems to be missing quite a few foods. My only other complaint is that you need to know a proper serving and that information is not always available or known by the consumer.
2037,2037,5,2013-04-24T02:07:19.000Z,Fishy Fishy!!,Love This Freaking App!,Get it use it and you won't be disappointed. Just got back from Trader Joe's and was scanning everything. The people that work were so impressed they were going out and downloading it.
2038,2038,5,2013-05-01T15:21:44.000Z,Grich41,Love it!,"Makes it easy to track your daily food choices and count calories.  If your choice is not very healthy, it gives you several alternatives that are better."
2039,2039,5,2013-05-05T13:53:48.000Z,Sherrycocoa,Excellent app!,Excellent app I do not count calories but I love I scan and the alternatives it provides. I also like the ratings as I learned a few foods I eat and thought was healthy were not! Grrr !
2040,2040,5,2011-09-16T18:45:35.000Z,Foodlover88,A wonderful app to download,This is a great app! It always has some interesting facts about each food I buy and lists some good potential concerns for some foods that really aid in the users ability to make healthy choices!
2041,2041,5,2011-09-19T14:35:18.000Z,HelloClarice83,Very educational tool,This is a great app!  This app helped me pick out the healthiest foods available in all categories. I also like how you can type in a specific brand for what you are looking for and it will give healthier alternatives.
2042,2042,5,2011-10-08T16:28:57.000Z,Mammaof6,Awesome app,I love this app for so may reasons but mostly because it allows me to make small changes to be healthier without changing the way my family eats. It is helping me to make wiser choices for my whole family!
2043,2043,5,2011-10-11T23:16:40.000Z,Ed Sings,Super app!,"I really like this app and use it frequently.  Also, my daughter is interested in it too which is helping me to teach her about wise food choices.  I do look forward to an updated product list.  Great App!"
2044,2044,5,2011-10-26T19:45:05.000Z,Chelle334,Fun & informative!,Not only can you see how the food that you purchase rates but you can also look at similar products to see which is the healthiest. Fooducate also describes what some food terms mean. That's helpful to me!
2045,2045,5,2011-12-08T16:34:50.000Z,Allison4t39,Good,"It's nice to know if the ""healthy"" food you are eating is actually healthy or not. I wish they would tell you where you can buy the alternatives because sometimes I have no idea where to get them."
2046,2046,1,2012-03-12T09:47:07.000Z,Prettygirlrock23,Update iOS 5.1,"Ever since I updated my software to 5.1 this app doesn't work, it refuses to get passes the scanner without displaying the ""check connections with cellular or wireless connections then try again or dismiss."" it's irritating and trying to report the bug through support came up with a blank page."
2047,2047,5,2012-04-19T17:38:22.000Z,Brittlw,Great for grocery shopping!,I've been using this app for a while and love it. Now that they finally order the searches by grades I had to give it a 5 star rating. It makes using the app so much easier!
2048,2048,5,2012-05-12T02:21:03.000Z,S^3a,Easy to use,Great app! It's easy and very informative. When they don't have info ready it allows you to take pics and automatically sends it in. Takes only 30 seconds
2049,2049,1,2012-05-25T00:13:53.000Z,Spediteur,I deleted it due to new terms of service,"Registration is now required. I didn't accept the absolutely outrageous terms of service so I don't know exactly what personal info was required.  I could not agree to give the seller all rights, title, and interest and waive any other remaining rights to my info. While I can understand the need for a  business to protect itself, this piece of software doesn't seem to warrant the extent that is demanded. Read it for yourself."
2050,2050,4,2011-03-19T22:19:05.000Z,Interceptor208,Awesome app! Just one additional request...,Love this app and all it does.  The only thing I wish could be added was the ability to search manually instead of always having to scan or enter a barcode. That would certainly merit five stars!
2051,2051,5,2011-04-17T03:19:24.000Z,JustinCrawford,Fooducate is amazing!,"Scanner works really really well... Fast. Comparisons and alternative choice tools in the app make it totally invaluable. I am also particularly impressed with how well they've implemented the process of contributing items that are not yet present in their db, very cool. Love it."
2052,2052,5,2011-07-24T13:54:57.000Z,SheawithTwins,Great App,"This is my favorite app! I am scanning everything in my pantry and the grocery store. I do pretty well buying the most healthy options, but I have had several eye-openers. I really like the 'alternative' tab and the 'compare' tab. Very helpful!"
2053,2053,5,2011-08-14T15:07:05.000Z,Ohiogirlie74,Great UI and super information!!,"Love the look and feel of this app, and the info presented is way handy. While sometimes I'll still end up eating a poorly rated food, it's good to know I have some making up to do. Love this little buddy!!"
2054,2054,5,2011-08-14T22:10:03.000Z,Jeyana,ÓÄéÓÄéÓÄéÓÄéÓÄé,"I love this app, tells me the best product to buy. Some products have misleading ads, by scanning the product it tells u the bad ingredients and also ratesbthe product. Since i have this app, i been choosing my food wisely."
2055,2055,5,2011-08-19T18:26:19.000Z,Lizjeller,Use it every time I shop!,"I really benefit from this app! I have lost some weight because it has taught me how to eat healthier! There are a lot of diet foods out there that are not good for you, and this app has helped me eat more natural. I feel great!"
2056,2056,5,2011-08-24T15:50:31.000Z,mmel6,Must have:),"Perfect for dieting, watching carbs!  The information on this app is so precise, if the average grade is low it gives you several alternatives to choose!  If u drink diet sodas your going to be shocked!  Well worth the price, the scanner is fun and the results are educational!"
2057,2057,5,2015-12-31T03:30:34.000Z,Triestobehealthy,Amazing app,"Great app, really simple way to check if a food is healthy or not. I don't use it to diet but instead to see what food is made of, if there's questionable ingredients, manufacturing process etc. This app is perfect for my needs."
2058,2058,5,2016-01-29T18:11:13.000Z,Speef123445,Great help,I love this app! I use it while shopping. It helps me to decide which brand or type to buy. I'm becoming more and more aware about the ingredients I should avoid to help myself eat better food. Get it! Use it!
2059,2059,3,2016-07-10T15:36:41.000Z,Physicsmazz,Great app...except for recipes,I love the app for scanning foods. However it's completely useless for recipes. You can't edit or delete a recipe once you've created it. You also can't change units when entering food into a recipe making me do odd conversions to enter ingredients.
2060,2060,4,2014-04-03T13:30:33.000Z,Thnkubasedgod,Great!,This app is way better than myfitnesspal. But there could be more barcodes and foods put into the system so I don't have to create my own food everytime I scan something. I like that there are articles pertaining to fitness and everyday living.
2061,2061,2,2014-08-06T16:29:00.000Z,Becauseofjesus92,I Shouldn't Have to Pay for Health,"I really like this app and I turn to it whenever grocery shopping. However, I don't think it's fair to have to pay to find out if a product is GMO. It's counterproductive. If you preach that being healthy shouldn't cost much, then why do I need to subscribe to pro to make better choices?! Shouldn't I spend that money on healthy food instead?"
2062,2062,5,2014-09-26T14:27:27.000Z,Missro007,Wonderful app!,I'm glad I found out about this app! I'm better able to keep up with what I eat & see how I can improve my diet!! I don't always have time to log all my meals but this app keeps me mindful of what I am eating
2063,2063,4,2015-02-10T16:31:49.000Z,Lilah Day,Great app!!,"This app is informative, useful, fast, and efficient. My only critique is that more should be available without having to purchase an upgraded version. Other than that, though, it has helped me stay on my diet and encourages me to eat healthier 24/7."
2064,2064,5,2015-02-17T21:15:51.000Z,"One old lady ""just saying""",Food app,"Been using less than a week, but I can say I really am loving using it. Great way to understand what you are putting in your body."

2066,2066,4,2015-07-21T22:09:15.000Z,Taggie05,Great App,I own a Fitbit and the Fitbit app is great but I love this app it gives you a more detailed account of what you are putting into your body. It's quite fabulous and easy to you. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the in app purchases are a bit pricey.
2067,2067,5,2015-08-27T03:52:39.000Z,marktaylor22,Absolutely delightful to use!,After recently being diagnosed celiac I've been struggling to figure out the best way to eat healthy. A friend told me about this app and pretty much changed my outlook on GF. It's absolutely a fantastic app and very encouraging. I'm so happy!
2068,2068,5,2015-08-31T11:15:05.000Z,Tuner2theend,Great app,"Love the app. Great for awareness of products. One thing i would love improved is the ""alternatives"" there are times that it gives alternatives that don't seem to relate, or maybe I'm reading it wrong... Other than that i love this app... Food smart!"
2069,2069,3,2015-09-09T02:29:56.000Z,Rastamomma.NOLA,Like the integration with my health apps & Apple Watch,I like this app but it needs to update its list of foods. I'll scan the barcode and the app won't recognize the food. I spend a lot of time putting in details about foods I like. Lose it! has a more extensive list of foods but does not integrate as well with my health apps & Apple Watch.
2070,2070,5,2013-03-01T16:51:07.000Z,KingsKid238,Great App!!  Very easy to use and helpful!,This is such a convenient way to count calories!  It also helps me to make better food choices by rating the items. Very helpful and easy to use!
2071,2071,5,2013-03-31T02:40:53.000Z,Jeremy Pennell,Love it!,This app is very easy to use and motivating as far as making healthy food choices is concerned. I love having the ability to scan foods instead of manually entering in the food item.
2072,2072,5,2013-04-13T19:57:09.000Z,Gwyndyr,Excellent,"Great app with loads of info.  The database is always getting better because the users help gather, fantastic plan. We get chances at freebies too!  This is not even a game, yet the developers made it fun and informative. Highly recommended."
2073,2073,5,2013-04-18T16:41:57.000Z,CTR_MM,Love it!,So far I live everything about this app. I now scan everything before I buy it. I especially like that they provide better alternatives than what you may have chosen.
2074,2074,5,2013-04-29T05:26:12.000Z,TTNTXCO,Very helpful thank you!,I had drifted ip the scales without really paying attention. All of a sudden I was 15 pounds heavier in only a matter if weeks. This app allowed me to focus and readjust with tracking along with good ratings to help me make smarter choices.
2075,2075,4,2013-05-10T22:39:45.000Z,Taptak2,Good for GMO Advice,"I love this application, particularly for looking to see if an item might have genetically modified food Ingredients in it. It is a rather simple application, for those that are used to reading labels. But I definitely use it at the grocery store while I am shopping to scan things."
2076,2076,3,2013-06-16T16:06:52.000Z,Gertlerty,Good app,"Pretty easy way to track calories and helpful when shopping for healthy food.  Would love a ""report"" of some kind that actually provides recap of nutrients (and bad stuff) you eat.  Also, would be fantastic if there were a recipe input option (include all ingredients and then save the receipt to your favorites)."
2077,2077,5,2014-01-20T11:21:52.000Z,Gchild88,Worth the time and Effort,"If you are serious about tracking meals or understanding make makes a particular food healthy or unhealthy, this is the app for you. I'm seriously considering upgrading to the fooducate Pro for 9.99 for the lifetime deal."
2078,2078,5,2014-03-13T19:06:42.000Z,Bethdug,Love,"Love this app.  Bought the pro version on my new phone. Was surprised by the health tracker and love it! One thing I wish was they had an option for nursing mothers in the health tracker. But other than that, I highly recommend."
2079,2079,4,2014-03-27T03:28:18.000Z,Becca_*,Good App.,"I don't like how you can't submit your own amount of water. I also think there should be more available pictures and info about more foods. But overall, awesome. Very useful and teaches you a lot about foods you probably never knew."
2080,2080,5,2011-08-25T17:03:04.000Z,Mikeyr2014,Pretty informative,Good way to get some quick facts about a product without  going through the hassle of sifting through link after link on the web.
2081,2081,5,2011-11-18T12:00:34.000Z,Alladdie,Good stuff,I use this app everyday...it helps you be conscious of the food you're letting pass your lips and educate choice if you will;) also if you're on watcher watcher it tells you how many pts something is...one of my favorite apps!!!
2082,2082,4,2012-02-07T18:35:32.000Z,Mhl80,"Great, educational app!","Very engaging - I am a compulsive scanner now! They are still building their bank of food items and I have found a lot of products that aren't in yet , but this is an undeniably useful app for anyone looking to educate themselves and make better food choices."
2083,2083,5,2012-06-04T06:16:41.000Z,Chris12923,Really cool,This app really impressed me. My daughter showed it to me. I didn't use it at first but then I was at the store with the wife and we were using it like crazy. Makes shopping fun and educated you at the same time.
2084,2084,5,2012-09-01T22:00:30.000Z,Mooneyes1023,Informative,This app turned out to be suprisingly fun. I cant help but scan everything i buy when at the grocery store. Allows me to do better choices and i like the list and history section! Fun fun fun
2085,2085,5,2012-09-06T19:40:38.000Z,Dis kitchen,Informative,"A great device to learn and stay knowledgable about what you put in your body. I'm a conscious eater and am surprised at how many of the ""healthy"" & ""natural"" items have poor ratings due to being loaded with junk! Thanks Fooducate!"
2086,2086,5,2012-09-21T00:46:47.000Z,Jac-in-the-Xbox,Great app,This app has really helped my parents be more conscious of what they eat. Now if I could just get the cost of nutritious food down to where they could afford to buy it over the unhealthier options.
2087,2087,4,2012-11-29T21:00:07.000Z,LPUT,Very useful app,I have frequently used this app to scan a product in order to obtain the points plus value. It has probably found the item 95% of the time.  I find scanning a barcode easier than computing the value. A very helpful app
2088,2088,5,2012-12-10T11:51:01.000Z,edbarnes51,Very useful app,Scanner works just fine for me. They have a ton of products. If its not in there you can easily snap 3 photos with your phone and send an email to have them upload it.
2089,2089,5,2013-01-16T17:37:10.000Z,Lrabadi,Absolutely love the recent upgrade,"This is the most used app on my phone! I love it! Informational, great usability, looks amazing too. Never glitches and the database is enormous. I also love that they respond very quickly to new food requests. The best!!!"
2090,2090,5,2011-05-30T16:55:39.000Z,MrsShockley,Fun for kids - WW friendly,My kids love to find items in the store and scan for nutrition info or add to the database - which keeps me shopping and all of us happy. Also gives food point values for WW - which is a HUGE bonus!
2091,2091,5,2011-06-13T21:06:48.000Z,Fabiojuamcarlos,Excellent,This app is excellent it tells you everything you need to know about everything. It is also fun to have a competition to see who can find the healthiest thing in your pantry
2092,2092,5,2011-07-01T13:27:49.000Z,culleoka,Great Idea,"Great idea, can't wait to try it.  I think before I go to the grocery store I'll start scanning my ""staples"" and edit my list to cut down scanning time in the store.  This will give me practice and hopefully cut down on time scanning in the store."
2093,2093,4,2011-07-19T22:21:26.000Z,Bugsizzy,Overall very good,Pros: tons of products; easy to add new ones; search by scanning barcode
2094,2094,5,2011-07-28T04:04:39.000Z,axsimpson,Awesome,The best app I've used in a long time. I never knew how much junk I've been putting into my body and I thought it was healthy. My veggie burgers only got a c rating. The best was when my daughter scanned jolly ranchers and it told her to eat an orange instead.
2095,2095,5,2016-05-05T02:30:01.000Z,him229,Great at what it's does!,I always use this app whenever I go grocery shopping. Scanning items is crazy fast and so is adding items. Helps me decide what to purchase. So glad to have discovered this.
2096,2096,1,2016-05-14T16:30:30.000Z,T Fry <3 <3 <3,Impossible to cancel,I really liked the features of this app but hated all the adverts at the bottom. I thought if I upgraded to Pro the ads would go away but they are still there!! So ridiculous... Now it's literally impossible to cancel the pro subscription. I have written to the support team with no response. So now I'm stuck paying $5/month till the end of time??? This is absolutely inexcusable if you ask me.
2097,2097,5,2017-01-10T04:37:56.000Z,sassy_dds,Best food app!,I love that I can track the quality of the food I eat as I'm focused on a real food diet/lifestyle.  I got this app 2 years ago and started using it again this January.  So many more foods have been added- awesome!
2098,2098,2,2017-01-19T02:47:33.000Z,TGreen3,Can no longer use without signing up? Pass.,It was a good app that i would use on occasion. I just had an occasion..but was greeted with a sign up first screenü§î I closed the app and checked my screen to be sure I'd opened the right app..yep. Nope. Delete.

2103,2103,5,2014-12-19T21:32:02.000Z,Smaug001,Helps keep me honest,"Tracks everything, stuff is easy to look up. It gives grades on foods, and a rationale behind each grade, along with suggestions of alternatives. One can even enter foods by bar codes!"
2104,2104,1,2015-01-03T04:55:43.000Z,lanwarrior,Why an account is required before I can use the app?,"This should not be a requirement. Many other successful companies, like Yelp, don't even need an account to use their app.  Give us that option! Every app that requires an account will create more security issues in the future: many people stop using the app and if the app is hacked, now their account can be used to hack other accounts. Name, email, password, etc."
2105,2105,4,2015-02-07T15:50:31.000Z,Studynut,Awesome Health App,I love this app for keeping up with more than just calories. I never realized just how much sugars and added sugars I was consuming everyday nor how little fiber I was getting. I have also been learning a lot about health and food by reading the daily pro tips.
2106,2106,5,2015-05-29T12:16:34.000Z,EnoughAlready@!,Very informative app,I'm trying to eat cleaner. Less processed foods and less sugar this app helps determine what to eat. I wish the additional features did not cost so much. Otherwise I use this app every day.

2108,2108,5,2016-02-17T20:17:07.000Z,Def E.K. Shun,Weight loss easier,Love love love this app. Helps me drop pounds because it lets me in on  the sugar tricks they try. It may say zero sugars but they hide it with different names so it still produces insulin when you eat it. Dropping weight like crazy
2109,2109,5,2016-03-31T18:29:53.000Z,PsybersWriter,Exciting prospect and it works,Just beginning to use this but all the components work. I have an illness I'm managing so keeping track of my food and energy levels by activity levels is working.

2113,2113,5,2013-04-02T13:42:55.000Z,Pickelgurl08,Best Free App ever!,This app is really helping me make smart decisions and is helping me reach my weight goal. I love the fact that I can get Alerts to track EVERYTHING I'm eating! I'm restricted to 1200 calories a day and this is definitely helping a lot!! Highly recommended!! :)
2114,2114,4,2013-04-13T22:28:50.000Z,Bayafay,Good... But not great,"Very excellent in tracking foods that have a barcode, but doesn't help with a general food list."
2115,2115,5,2013-05-08T05:32:17.000Z,College girl123,Absolutely changed my lifestyle!,This app is amazing and way better than the weight watcher app. It has enabled me to become a more conscious consumer in terms of what I put into my body. Love it and would recommend it to anyone!
2116,2116,5,2013-06-10T09:27:05.000Z,Amanda11042008,Fooducate,Love this!!! Really breaks down what I'm eating into easy to follow stats and explanations. I love love the scan feature. I scan away at the grocery store. I never thought different brands of things could be so different health wise. Awesome!!!
2117,2117,5,2013-09-14T19:49:24.000Z,SpkTrue,Fabulous,This is the best app ever if you care about your foods. I use it to avoid processed food with GMO. I only buy products that pass.  Your body and medical bills will thank you for not poisoning yourself and your family.  Thank you so much Fooducate.
2118,2118,5,2014-01-04T05:30:40.000Z,JonR31,One of the best apps I've ever used,"I use this app every time I go food shopping.  It has changed the way I eat completely.  If more people would use this app when they shopped, obesity rates would plummet."
2119,2119,5,2014-02-01T15:45:41.000Z,Fooducated friend,Love it,"This app is awesome, just started using it and it's so easy to track your food and exercise. May be a little generous on the calories, I don't know since I just started, but that can easily be fixed!"
2120,2120,5,2012-01-19T16:52:24.000Z,AliasR,App for everyone,This is a great app and if you really want to know what you eat this is the best thing out there. It opened my eyes and I've changed some of the things I eat because of it. Highly recommended!
2121,2121,5,2012-01-21T02:32:53.000Z,Fjbkjfetvjommg,A must have shopping tool!,Extremely useful and user friendly. Can't wait for even more products! Makes making the right food decision even simpler!
2122,2122,5,2012-01-21T14:25:24.000Z,Ggjdjfhjdj,Can't do without this app!,I love this app and use it every day.  The scanner makes it so easy to count my weight watchers points and actually works better and easier than the weight watchers app.
2123,2123,5,2012-02-05T05:24:26.000Z,Yessikka,Excellent & useful app.,I would highly recommend this app. I must seem crazy in the supermarket scanning away all the different food choices. I've used and benefited from this app many times. The best part? It's free.
2124,2124,5,2012-02-20T13:43:25.000Z,Kwalkrr,Kwalkrr,Love this app... A few times so far if they have not had a food in their system yet after I scan it they have found it and let me know it is in their system now!
2125,2125,4,2012-05-03T20:59:20.000Z,Jp1144,Fun app,Fun to scan items at the store to see how they score but after a few times using it it is easy to guess what they are going to say about a product. None the less it makes one think about the food you eat.
2126,2126,5,2012-05-11T17:19:27.000Z,JejenkaTunes,Easy to use and helpful,This app is amazing! I will no longer go grocery shopping without it. I hope to make more educated purchases from now on. Kudos to the team who built it! Works flawlessly.
2127,2127,5,2012-05-24T05:19:11.000Z,Lorakkudra23,Is this real food??,"My 4-year-old son and I now use the app for all packaged foods to determine if it's ""real"" or not. His diet has improved greatly and he has started questioning every food to determine if it's real or not. It's awesome. Thank you for this app!!"
2128,2128,5,2012-07-27T20:48:53.000Z,1 Child,Head Shopper,Glad I found this App. Very helpful and I use it often.  Information has deterred me from purchasing items. Must have App to keep your family on the track to healthy eating.

2130,2130,5,2011-07-23T02:38:38.000Z,CindiStickle,Love this app!!,This app is the best and the scanner works EVERY time. Don't know why people are saying the scanner doesn't work. They need to contact the developer instead of giving a bad rating. Some people are just plain mean :( LOVE THIS APP! Keep up the great job!
2131,2131,5,2011-07-28T01:15:00.000Z,Foodey,Beat site ever,"I have totally changed some of the things I eat & what I buy, even got my local health food store owner to download it, she loves it too. A day doesn't go by that I don't check something, it's wonderful to have this!"
2132,2132,5,2011-07-28T13:58:05.000Z,Hailsbells,I love this app!,Yes it has shed new light on the food I always thought was okay(Trust me once you start scanning you will be shocked.) but my favorite thing is that it gives you healthier alternatives so you can make better decisions. I just love this app.
2133,2133,5,2011-08-14T19:44:00.000Z,Taff1001,Great app.,"This is a great app.  It is helping me make health choices in the store.  It is quick and easy to use.  It also is reliable, I.e. It does not crash.  I love how it not only rates the food item but gives you alternate healthier options."
2134,2134,5,2011-09-04T17:26:30.000Z,Axxis302,Awesome app...,"This food app is great. I've been scanning all the food in our apartment and grocery stores. Obviously, you can figure out what foods are mostly healthy and ones to stay away from."
2135,2135,5,2011-09-11T01:53:14.000Z,BetterEats,Best app!,Our family eats better and we actually are saving money at the grocery store. Better options are often less expensive!!
2136,2136,4,2011-10-09T14:27:32.000Z,EricL2,All good,Nice app. I paid for the plus version and I don't notice any difference except for absence of ads. I would rate as a five if the pictures of the products were bigger on the iPhone and if there were more store brands. Bottom line: I use it every time I shop.
2137,2137,5,2011-11-01T04:09:07.000Z,knunes,Like it a lot,"It's a very informative app that helps me make more conscious food decisions. It has many items in its catalog, but not everything. Cool feature that allows you to compare two items with ease"
2138,2138,4,2011-11-06T00:51:17.000Z,Junie3678,Very good,Extremely helpful when grocery shopping. It has become my favorite app. If I'm at the store and I wonder if I'm choosing the healthier product this app is extremely helpful. I also love their alternatives section. It gives me healthier options to my favorite unhealthy snacks.
2139,2139,5,2011-11-20T12:29:29.000Z,Jwiff,Superb Tool!,"I educate people on making healthier food choices.  This app, with its letter grade and nutrition info,  makes it a quick and helpful tool by raising awareness of their current and future choices.  Most people have no idea how unhealthy their ""favorite"" foods are."
2140,2140,5,2011-06-09T12:53:48.000Z,Jodale1972,AWESOME!!!,"This app is tremendous for anyone interested in eating healthier. The only down side, in my case, is the fact that some of the recommended products are not available in any of the stores in my area, but that is not the app's fault."
2141,2141,5,2011-07-02T17:50:09.000Z,Hello...Newman,Great App,I use this app almost everyday and find it extremely helpful choosing the products that are better for me. I recently changed my eating style and this app helps by keeping me on a healthy path.
2142,2142,5,2011-07-10T23:55:10.000Z,Jeanise Chapman,One of the best apps on my phone!,This app is very informative and makes you aware of the ingredients in your everyday products. I love the alternative products they give. The grading scale is awesome too! Very grateful for the choice to eat something healthier.
2143,2143,5,2011-07-19T00:43:50.000Z,riverrunner2008,Very useful wellness tool!!,"As a wellness coordinator and weight loss coach, I see clients on a regular basis who say they don't know why they can't lose weight. They eat ""healthy"". Fooducate does the arguing for me. It's not as simple as calories in, calories out.. Fooducate proves that time & again."
2144,2144,4,2011-07-22T05:05:45.000Z,Luvmygoldenz,App worth paying for!,I love shopping with this app!  I have already replaced several foods with better choices that I have found on Fooducate. It has made me much more aware of the nutritional value of what I am buying and eating. Just needs more data on whole foods store brands.
2145,2145,5,2016-02-25T02:58:14.000Z,Sj348,Awesome,This app is amazing it keeps track of all your calories and what food group they came from and there is rarely a food the scanner doesn't recognize. Definitely deserves 5 stars
2146,2146,5,2016-04-30T13:19:33.000Z,Fritt1,Wonderful app,I love the ease of food tracking with this app!  Scanning is super easy and really fun too. I like learning about the food ratings and it helps me to understand how to make better food choices.
2147,2147,5,2017-01-06T01:22:28.000Z,Ann-with an-e,Useful and fun,This tracker is very useful for counting calories and seeing the overall healthiness of food choices. You can also see the reasons for a food's grade and how to find one healthier. It has great recommendations as well.
2148,2148,5,2017-05-08T23:24:30.000Z,Megicus,Tracking Sugar,"I was having a hard time finding an app to track my sugar intake. Plenty will calculate calories and carbs, but I'm more concerned with sugars and this tracks both added and natural. I'm enjoying it so far!"
2149,2149,5,2017-06-26T18:37:39.000Z,Jcg4jc,Love it,"It is easy to use. Covers most storebought foods,restaurants and easy to Add your own.  The community is great, you know you are not alone. Being able to track exercise helps a lot as well"
2150,2150,5,2014-04-05T00:44:34.000Z,Moniche1,Really good,"Easy, informative, useful. Looks like they constantly try to add more foods so that is helpful. I like that it gives you calorie information, nutrition information and point information."
2151,2151,5,2014-05-24T18:01:24.000Z,Sincereleigh,Valuable tool,"This app has become one that I can't do without. As a newly diagnosed celiac, it removed a lot of the guess work and provided much needed nutritional info. An absolute must have for grocery shopping!"
2152,2152,4,2014-07-09T15:37:49.000Z,Teresa Champion,Great app,"Super helpful in telling you why the food is bad for you. Goes beyond just counting calories. Love the grades it gives the food. Wish it was just a bit more streamlined seems a little clunky still. Otherwise great and very helpful, and I never write reviews!"
2153,2153,2,2014-08-08T09:23:08.000Z,Sportsbiz,New Design Terrible,Was extremely helpful and Houston consulate. With new design it's no hard to look up food and has become significantly less useful. I have no desire to scroll through comments from random people on products I would never ever buy or eat or drink. Just let me look up what I need without waiting through a bunch of social junk.
2154,2154,5,2015-02-06T23:10:34.000Z,Shell&Terry91,GREAT APP!!,"I love this App. The grading system. Logging all the foods you eat everyday so your sure not to go over what you want to stay at as far as calories, fiber, protein etc. And love the alternatives it gives you.

2156,2156,4,2015-05-19T12:19:31.000Z,brian6string,Easy and helpful,"Enter your food, or scan the barcode and get a ""grade"", what could be easier. At the grocery sore? Scan a barcode, see the grade, click alternatives. Nutrition info is crowd sourced. Kinda love this app--it's the nagging spouse/parent/doctor without having to buy flowers later."
2157,2157,4,2015-11-16T20:25:21.000Z,Coorrraaa,MY FAV,"I HAVE to eat organic , I hate processed foods and whenever I wanna look up a food I always use this app at the store or when I'm w my friends basically I use this all a lot lol but I don't really use the calorie counter part of the app I just always look up foods and I like how it rates it"
2158,2158,5,2016-01-04T16:13:05.000Z,Ozarksiris,Helpful scanner,I like to use the scanner to compare similar items or brands at the store. Decide which to buy based on rating. Makes me feel better about my choices.

First you were no longer able to log in via your acct whether it was FB or Email. I had to create a new account, just to find out they removed great features such as food being labeled GMO is no longer a feature. It's really unfortunate, but I am now removing this app. :("

MyFitnessPal database has about 95% of the foods I scan. Fooducate had about 65% (There are other brands other than Trader Joes) and 2) When I do scan something NOTin your database, I take the time to send the pics so you guys can put it up...but you don't. Or take exceptionally long time. Step up your game fellas."

A while back they were trying to make labeling laws for this reason it would be nice to have this done without government bureaucracy!"
2229,2229,5,2012-08-09T01:30:44.000Z,DaHoffClan,Wonderful,"It has changed the way I shop. Takes a bit longer at times but once you know what's bad , you just avoid that food. It's amazing how much junk is in ""healthy"" foods!"

It's so empowering to have a truthful interpretation of all the deceptive jargon that labels food misleadingly.

You can manually add it stuff but then you need to know calories etc.  I need the app to TELL ME THAT.  Great for making better choices on boxed food, but whole foods are lacking in choices."
2241,2241,5,2013-07-15T00:31:39.000Z,Outsidebowlingmachine,Very cool,"My 6 year old son loves scanning everything in the house. When he learned that frozen peas scored way higher than his favorite crackers, I could see a light bulb turn on over his head. He wants to eat healthy foods!"

2246,2246,4,2014-02-10T04:12:01.000Z,Prunella prunepuss,Love it!,I use it when I'm shopping all the time. My only complaint is sometimes it shows the same product more than once and they will have different ratings which is confusing.
2247,2247,3,2014-06-02T17:32:12.000Z,legiope,Good nutritional info; limited tracking,"I love and share the articles, but compared to other apps I have used the tracking features are limited.

2250,2250,5,2012-04-29T11:37:01.000Z,SueBeatrice,This app is fantastic.,I was amazed at how many foods I was mistaken about. Many that I thought were great choices were not so hot and some that I thought were terrible were actually not so bad. This is a great way to be an informed consumer.

I was so pleased to be turned on to it especially on the heels of the loss of Prop 37 (GMO - food labeling) I use it all the time to scan labels and find it extremely user friendly, quick and detailed."

2283,2283,5,2012-12-18T15:50:11.000Z,Tybaby4,Very Handy!,Such a great idea. Very helpful when grocery shopping and deciding between two things. Being able to add foods to the database is an extremely useful thing as well.
2284,2284,3,2013-02-20T14:33:40.000Z,Realhousewifeny,Wanna love this app more!!,"I love this app. but it needs a little more accuracy with its ratings, more foods in their database and it needs to be more user friendly. I love it for the great info it gives, but wind up using another app on a daily basis to track calories and use this app as a reference,... when it doesn't crash, wah"
2285,2285,1,2013-04-06T23:41:54.000Z,USSoccerFan48,Uneditable,"Checking it out, I had high hopes, but was highly disappointed once I tried to use it."
2286,2286,5,2013-05-14T05:27:36.000Z,Maya Jackson,Favorite app!,"This is an amazing app! Most of the other apps like this that I get are very bad but not this one! You can track what you eat, exercise and your weight! I recommend getting it!!"

2289,2289,4,2013-11-17T15:58:38.000Z,sonrisa244,Great app! But please,"Please get rid of the ""happening now"" section! I don't come here to socialize, and the reviews are largely unhelpful. One said ""I'm eating this right now."" Another reviewer said the product contained GMOs, but this info was already listed in the nutritional info, so it's rather redundant. Please remove!"
2290,2290,4,2011-09-20T16:47:22.000Z,Chavygravy18,"Great, Informative",It really provides a scientific knowledge of all things I eat-- kinda scary in fact.

So for those who are eating a diet higher in healthy fats on purpose this app is frustrating."

Doesn't give you totals for protein/fat, just carbs, and didn't recognize the first 3 bar codes I scanned. Also from just 10 minutes of use I already found a nutritional error. It says 1 egg has 50 grams of protein. Not that it gives protein totals anyway, but what good is the info you see if it is not accurate or complete?"

Awesome for vegetarians

I find the recent update ugly and I don't understand why so many apps use a gray font that is difficult to read."

2410,2410,5,2013-01-10T12:22:35.000Z,NavyWaveHMVet,Great app,Apps come and go but Fooducate is literally a great App for those of us who truly want to eat healthy. It's a guide and the Food Teacker is also worth looking into. My teenage daughter loves it as well as my Co-workers. You won't regret downloading this App.
2411,2411,5,2013-04-23T03:17:22.000Z,Dandaswanman,Great app!,"Very helpful in our quest to eat healthier and ""cleaner"". If a food that I scan is not in the system...it shows up within days and I am notified that it is now available."

At least every other time I open it a screen pops up saying ""This feature requires network connectivity. Please wait while connecting to food database."". It takes a number of hours before it allows me on, which is very annoying."

2423,2423,4,2012-02-04T23:19:56.000Z,Manya63,Great help,"Love being able to have this app available at the market. So many foods do not have to have negative aspects pointed out on the label due to regulations. Ex: if a certain amount of sodium falls below regulation amounts, a food can be labeled ""low sodium"" .  Plus the app is constantly updating!"
2424,2424,4,2012-02-05T16:00:35.000Z,Mathgirl213,Great help,I love this ap! I use it every time I shop to make better choices! I was surprised at the things I thought were healthy that weren't because of too much sodium or additives that I wouldn't have checked. The ap is doing the research for you.
2425,2425,3,2012-02-13T23:54:47.000Z,Asymptotic42,Could be better,"The more I use this, the more one-dimensional it seems to me. It keeps giving me the same ingredient facts. I wish it had more facts on the food and and useful alternatives. I have a hard time pinpointing how un-useful it is. It's worth getting, but will likely start to ""collect dust"" before long."
2426,2426,5,2012-05-26T22:21:15.000Z,Lenora114,Very useful,I use this app a lot. It has saved me from buying foods that I thought were healthy. Watch out for false advertising on the products themselves!

2429,2429,4,2012-12-02T15:59:48.000Z,Dana4S,Great app,I really like this app.  It has really helped my family make better choices when we purchase items.   It still needs more brands added for our area but it has a pretty good selection.

I also liked th eole version better that simply told you why it got the rating it did. With some items, it is actually giving more information than I want but not giving me the info I'm looking for."

2456,2456,5,2015-12-31T14:52:42.000Z,Fat2FitMomma,So far so good,I really like this app over other weight loss/food tracking apps. So far everything I've scanned has been in the database. App is simple and easy to follow.
2457,2457,5,2016-01-05T16:18:20.000Z,Ajok8888,LOVE,I use a bunch of weight loss and health tracker apps. This one is the best for food. Wish the weight management and weight goals portion of the app would be a little more robust. Then it would be the only one I use!!
2458,2458,1,2016-02-12T11:17:50.000Z,Maxims-1,Not helpful if you eat real food,"The nutrition database is not searchable. You can either scan a barcode (almost always processed foods) or browse. Who has time to scroll through thousands of foods to find what you're looking for? I'm glad it's helpful to some, but I don't eat very many packaged foods (with barcodes) nor do I have time to browse when I'm looking for basic nutritional information."
2459,2459,2,2016-02-21T13:53:46.000Z,Anti-(fill in the blank),It's all about the food,Lots of ways to enter what you eat.
2460,2460,5,2013-06-19T11:42:24.000Z,Rsquaredky,Great tool,"This app is very handy when shopping.  I like being able to scan bar codes and getting immediate, easy to decipher information."
2461,2461,4,2013-07-09T14:36:05.000Z,MsKungfuBokchoy,Nice app but needs improvement,"I really like that I can scan a barcode and it'll rate it and warn me of GMOs.  My only issue is when I use the health tracker, I'm unable to add in homemade  meals....  Like I buy my meats from an organic farmer and I have no idea how to count calories from that."
2462,2462,4,2013-08-04T14:29:09.000Z,D Collins,Great app,Easy to use. Only problem is it doesn't have many of the foods I eat and when you put in a simple item like sugar it lists a bunch of goods with the name of sugar in them like sugar snap peas ...everything but sugar. Not enough restaurant foods. Only restaurant pizza is Pizza Hut.
2463,2463,3,2014-01-20T22:23:41.000Z,t&r119,Great app,The reason why I give it a 3 is smily because I wish it had a bigger list of exercises with the info in it. Instead if saying other and it attempt to generate a generic amount of calories burnt. There are other apps that have crazy exercise options to choose from....
2464,2464,5,2014-01-31T12:49:10.000Z,casetheace,Really enjoy,"Great app with insightful info, tips, and alternative recommendations for products you thought were ""healthy"". Has really helped me learn and think about my eating habits."
2465,2465,4,2014-03-10T22:43:21.000Z,Raven323!,Really impressed,"I was skeptical about downloading as usually these kind of apps are complicated and otherwise generally unhelpful, but I am glad I did! So far it's user friendly, uncomplicated and helpful. It's really keeping me on track!"
2466,2466,5,2014-04-15T12:39:04.000Z,ARTORIVS,Best well-eating app,This app is the best tool to start paying more attention to what we eat. I certainly recommend it to those who want to eat healthier and be conscious of the afwul stuff that is in our foods.
2467,2467,5,2014-07-15T01:30:14.000Z,Nicholas Bolitho,Informative and fun!,"Great data base, I was suprised how many obscure food items I have been able to find info.  I love this app and recommend it to anyone who cares about what they eat."

2471,2471,5,2012-06-23T19:04:01.000Z,CheerioMommio,Fabulous,So handy to have in the grocery store!  You can scan several options and get the healthiest one.  Or at least know what gets a bad grade and eat a little...
2472,2472,5,2012-12-29T05:37:38.000Z,CarTechDude,Healthy and fun app,This app is absolutely great. You can scan almost anything. I still haven't found any food that they don't have information on. Best food scanning app out there!
2473,2473,4,2013-01-15T14:58:28.000Z,Juude613,Great App,I have only had this app three days and I really like it. I just wish they had a full calorie count of all foods. When you don't have anything to scan it's kind if hard to get a good count. Restaurants
2474,2474,5,2013-01-28T18:28:21.000Z,Fooducate user,I love this!,I used to use other food logging app but this one provides healthy alternatives and is very easy to use! I highly recommend this to anyone trying to be healthier.
2475,2475,5,2013-03-03T21:26:55.000Z,No nickname !!!,To good to be true,This is the app I've been waiting for. It's easy to use and understand. It makes me look forward to keeping up with my health and exercise !!!
2476,2476,4,2013-03-17T07:33:41.000Z,Pinterestingly good,Great for ex-couch potatoes,I'm a couch potato mostly because eating healthy seemed overwhelming and confusing. But Fooducate is great way to ease into it.
2477,2477,5,2013-04-08T13:16:55.000Z,SleepyBJ,Very cool,Rarely have to enter new items. It has them already. Could be easier to look up items if no barcode though.

2480,2480,4,2011-10-25T01:27:03.000Z,Stepclimber,Love It!,I love this app.  My only complaint is it doesnt recognize 1/2 of the items I scan.  My suggestion would be to add a dictionary of food ingredients. If a food wasn't in the system I could still look up what the ingredients mean.
2481,2481,4,2011-11-06T14:42:30.000Z,BrewmasterK,Fun at the grocery store,"Will be better as the product database grows. The interface is really good and the information is fantastic. Too bad it doesn't give you average retail price for the products as well, that would be even more fun."

Love the way it shows parts of foods that are not healthy and explains why.  I like the letter grade it assigns, alternate foods it will suggest and the food point ratings are dead on!  Great app!!!"
2484,2484,5,2011-11-29T18:43:12.000Z,Mike99PA,Healthy Choices 101,Brilliant App. I use this app every time I visit the market. It's great for making wise healthy decisions. I love it! I started off scanning all the items at home then began using it while shopping. Betterliving!

2486,2486,5,2012-02-03T22:29:27.000Z,Dame Al,Great app,I've used it at home and in the store. Amazing at the junk I wanted to buy but seeing the ratings I put them back. Easy to use and once more foods are in database will be even more amazing!!
2487,2487,5,2012-02-18T21:13:56.000Z,Lake Forest,Fooducate,I love living a healthy lifestyle. I choose fresh produce and opt to only eat fish. This app helps me choose wisely while choosing ingredients and products such as cereal while grocery shopping. I recommend this app!

2494,2494,5,2011-08-31T05:24:59.000Z,Rotkob,Use it a Lot,It's actually helping me to make better food choices. The only drawback is I spend longer time shopping as I'm scanning everything ;)

2497,2497,4,2016-04-12T14:06:28.000Z,Maggie the Pirate,Looks good so far,I like the community support and the user added foods. I looked for the nutritional info on a Whole Foods quiche and it was only available from another user. I'm hoping the grocery/fast food list is sufficiently comprehensive.

2508,2508,5,2015-05-28T21:08:48.000Z,Peter the pidgoen,New to using...but really liking it,Keeps me occupied when a craving comes - so much information laid out very intuitively. The grades and reasons behind them as well as the suggested alternatives are awesome!

2546,2546,5,2011-08-01T00:54:45.000Z,Vegasbaby08,Love it,"Love it! Use it pretty much daily! Breaks my heart that the things I love eating aren't as good as I thought! Real eye opener! Just when you think your doing better, you find out that ain't so!glad for the info!"

2548,2548,5,2011-08-18T15:19:29.000Z,Chelssnow,Wonderful!,"This is a wonderful application. It reveals the truth about the good health (or lack thereof) of foods, and is constantly being updated with the help of app users! I use it for everything from satisfying curiosity to picking out groceries."

2550,2550,4,2014-11-16T02:46:53.000Z,Dungeonman,Good App,"It could be great, but you have to stop people from putting non food items on here. Cigarettes?? Alcohol? Make an app for those things and who the hell doesn't know cigarettes are bad for you!! But all and all, very good,,now work on being great!!"
2551,2551,5,2015-01-31T23:40:56.000Z,Holdishb,Awesome app for losing weight,"Basically tells you what to eat and what not to eat, also helps you keep track of what you eat(good for all those secret eaters out there like me)!!"

2558,2558,4,2017-05-03T04:14:46.000Z,SuzAtkins,Love it.,I love this app! I use points to track and just wish there was a simpler way to find points on foods. I have used a lot of apps to track and find this one very user friendly and educational.
2559,2559,5,2017-05-10T14:05:28.000Z,NoelJVDuke,Better than fitness pal,Better than fitness pal bc it tells you WHY something is bad for you and what to keep an eye out for AND gives alternatives!

2566,2566,3,2014-07-10T05:05:02.000Z,NVborn,Limits your food database,"You can add/scan foods to a shopping list and extract from that list to log your food intake. Problem is, you get the hang of doing it and then they tell you you can't add any more items. Makes the app worthless; haven't used it since."
2567,2567,1,2014-09-27T22:24:17.000Z,Cristina7171,"Requires a login, receives a delete",The concept for this app is great and I used the previous version fairly frequently. Now they require you to create an account with a password and email confirmation. Why? Because looking up food nutritional values requires privacy and security? So they can track my searches? They could do that anyway. This is an unnecessary barrier and bad customer service. No thanks.

I love seeing what foods contain GMOs (SOOOOOOOO many!) and I can see what I need to cut back on (sodium) really easily. So far, very satisfied."

As with any information, it's always prudent to check more than one source.  Lots of ""facts"" out there, be an informed consumer."

2575,2575,4,2013-04-09T18:57:35.000Z,Mjüíõ,Awesome,I think this is an awesome app however maybe a couple changes could be made to the fruit/veggies section.. I'd like to just enter that I ate a whole large skinless cucumber instead of trying to figure out how many serving sizes are
2576,2576,5,2013-04-23T15:43:48.000Z,TASands,Love it!,Awesome! Exactly what I need to keep me from having to read the ingredient lists of all my purchases for sneaky additives. Saves me so much time and makes shopping easy again!

2579,2579,4,2014-02-19T01:05:40.000Z,Jffrantz,Very good,This app probably deserves five stars. But I wanted to reserve the final star to see if I am bowled over after a few weeks. The exercise feature is a real convenience. Nice to have something to calculate calories burned for so many common activities.
2580,2580,5,2012-02-02T15:11:17.000Z,Kenziekay p,Grocery store go-to,I love this! The best part about it is that it gives better alternatives so you can constantly be making better choices

2598,2598,5,2012-01-29T12:48:38.000Z,LilLouandtu,Good Job!!,This is a great app-  good info in a time we really need it. So much we take for granted- if its in the grocery store it's okay for us- not so! And this is an app to help us walk through the land mine of deceptive labels and advertising.

Especially when I see C's and below for ""good"" foods.  This app works intermittent and is very frustrating.  I even paid $21 for gluten free info related items.  NOT worth it at all.  The app also was missing several items I tried to look up while in Target."
2608,2608,5,2016-05-15T02:45:01.000Z,AdventureRunner,Love This App...Very Worthwhile!,"I purchased Fooducate Pro for Life.  I think it's a investment in self.

However, I think the app would be better if they had more explanations for why the foods are graded the way they are. I also think that they should quickly add more foods to the database    ."

2656,2656,4,2015-09-25T01:28:17.000Z,Phpq,Adding exercise is broken,"Good app, but with the new UI, adding exercise is finicky to configure (sometimes doesn't allow configuration whatsoever until restart) and the 'add' button doesn't work, so it's essentially broken."
2657,2657,5,2016-06-21T16:13:14.000Z,Cri title,INCREDIBLE,An app I actually want to write a review about.

2667,2667,5,2013-12-07T19:50:44.000Z,WolfStryke,Helping me eat healthier!!!,This app is so convenient. I can go to the grocery store and learn about the facts that the labels do not tell me about my foods. Ie Fiber One bars hold an excessive amount of sugar in other ingredients that are hidden in the carb count! A DEFINITE RECOMMEND FOR EVERYBODY!

2673,2673,5,2013-03-04T00:07:56.000Z,Lilacshadow,Great app,Easy to use and track foods. Have to be careful about items in the database you use as some descriptions are different than the picture.
2674,2674,3,2013-03-05T21:29:24.000Z,Quiggle17,Good,It's a good app it just doesn't have alot of Minnesota popular good on it and it needs more exercise options for the burn it part and instead of counting calories in the burn it section it should count how many of the type of exercise instead of how many minutes
2675,2675,4,2013-03-26T12:57:02.000Z,Alicia63,Allie636,I really like this app but I only gave it four stars instead of five because it doesn't allow you to track your actual minutes that you workout.

2681,2681,5,2012-05-12T05:50:56.000Z,Tucsonmo,Fooducate,I think this is a great AP. I wish I could put my own foods I eat in there to see how many ingredients are bad. When you see how bad they are it helps you avoid those foods. Really fun!

2684,2684,5,2012-09-05T17:33:56.000Z,Eatoholic,Excellent app,Great app. It's easy and fun to use. Go scan crazy through your cabinets to see what your average grade is. Makes you think twice about foods and offers alternatives.

2690,2690,4,2011-08-13T21:10:31.000Z,uwskier54,Really Fun,For an achievement person it's fun to get a grade for the good foods you're buying. They are missing some of my crazy health nut foods but it's easy to submit them and most people don't eat the kind of stuff I eat so overall I think it's pretty awesome.

2707,2707,3,2011-08-02T15:48:52.000Z,Maigesheng,Good idea.,But it is a little vague on WHY things get better or worse grades. Would be better if it had nutritional value in detail.

2717,2717,3,2016-02-23T23:58:59.000Z,L'sreviews,so-so,At first I was excited about this app.     But if you want to track your carbs you have to buy the premium app which is surprisingly expensive--$75 a year!   No way.    If you are only interested in basic caloric intake and exercise this is your app.     Emphasis on basic.

2825,2825,4,2011-10-28T12:36:41.000Z,Singing Dave,Very good App,I find myself scanning almost everything to do comparative shopping.  Especially like the points info since I am on Weight Watchers.  I wish it would interface with my points tracker in WW. Overall it's a great App.

2827,2827,4,2011-11-15T05:43:26.000Z,Airborne!,Maybe a tiny Company biased at times.,"I can read & decipher labels enough to know that sometimes the app seems to get it wrong for some reason. It's a fun little app to educate you, but please don't make your decisions based solely on their ratings."

2831,2831,4,2011-07-05T16:56:06.000Z,Billybgood,Fun but limited,After using for a few days I find: about a third of products I input aren't in the data base; seems to overemphasize sugar at expense of other nutrients; alternatives aren't always real alternatives like water in place of juice.
2832,2832,5,2011-07-06T14:10:28.000Z,Kris Cardella,This app is awesome!!!,It's great to be able to check on all the foods you eat to see what you are putting in your body.  Most food is full of terrible stuff!

2837,2837,5,2016-05-08T01:17:04.000Z,Aaaakkkkgggg,Sugar bug,Unlike so many other similar apps this one tracks sugar and added sugars: a major cause why people can't lose weight. Also advocates for eating more solids v liquids. So great.

2915,2915,5,2013-04-18T04:29:29.000Z,MSREDROCKER,Confused,"I don't know why the app showed GMO, vegetarian & vegan foods when it never did before & after I deleted it & then uploaded it again it changed back"
2916,2916,5,2013-04-30T12:21:22.000Z,Royaltravelor,Super app,Fooducate is one of my favorite apps.  We always try to eat healthy.  This app really helps.  Some foods we were eating were not as healthy as we thought.

2922,2922,4,2012-08-16T18:11:34.000Z,ShelLaRue,Fooducate,I love this app. It really makes you pay attention to INGREDIENTS in what you're consuming in addition to calories and such. So many foods include so many unnecessary additives this app helps you to eat a little cleaner by offering healthy alternatives.

2929,2929,4,2013-03-17T01:18:06.000Z,HappyRunning,Fantastic detailed app,"Really nice and easy to use. Bad points for only tracking carbs and calories for daily balance without considering Na, fat, or protein. No ability to send report summary as email as far as I can see."
2930,2930,4,2011-11-16T05:05:07.000Z,Suzek00,Useful,This app actually helps a lot in the grocery store.  I'm amazed by food items I thought were healthy but actually fall short of the mark. Not all whole wheat is created equal!  Thanks for making this great app.

2936,2936,4,2012-03-08T20:33:39.000Z,Frequent Customer,ALMOST perfect!,This is easily my favorite app of all time. The only thing keeping it from a five star rating is that it doesn't cover food supplements. Make a similar app for supplements and I'll pay any price you put on it!
2937,2937,5,2012-04-16T23:16:46.000Z,Heart0fali0n47,Daily tips,The daily tips are very informative and interesting. It is good to see an app that wants to help people become aware of whats really going on in the food industry.

2939,2939,4,2012-05-09T15:20:26.000Z,CoachSherry,Great app for learning and making better food choices,This has turned out to be one of my faves. I share it with my clients to help them make better food choices in the grocery aisles.
2940,2940,5,2011-07-25T13:14:58.000Z,Peteglahn,Pretty Amazing,I use this app for interesting kitchen conversation more than for shopping but it's pretty cool. Scanner works great and the grading is based on more than just calories. I recommend it.

2947,2947,4,2011-10-21T14:55:38.000Z,Moonstruck2,Worth having,This is a fun and educational app. When I first got it I scanned all the food in my kitchen and really got a wake up call about what I was eating. Great in the grocery store to decide between two similar item.
2948,2948,5,2011-10-25T00:28:55.000Z,Getfit68,Very useful App,This App provides information I can't always get by just reading the labels. I have made changes based on the info provided by the App.

And how 'energy bars' add lots of different kinds of sugars so they can be listed lower on the ingredient list. I use it daily

3201,3201,5,2014-01-13T16:45:40.000Z,Chris776,Love it,Please keep adding products. I have migraines and this is excellent. I am also using it to track my weight
3202,3202,4,2014-02-06T02:14:02.000Z,redheadstep,Improved and very useful,"The newest version has some nice additions. Scanner works well, and I like the fact it also counts ""food"" points as well as calories, carbs etc."
3203,3203,2,2014-08-05T00:47:30.000Z,Dex__05,Don't like the update!,"I loved the design of the previous version, especially the peach! I just downloaded it two days ago and it already changed. I don't like seeing random comments from other people in the main page. I miss the helpful articles."
3204,3204,5,2014-08-16T20:02:56.000Z,Subvejjcdukbfukvd,Great,This app is easy to use. I like how it gives you the good rating and gives you better alternatives to eat.
3205,3205,2,2014-08-28T22:33:40.000Z,zoomerkind,Don't like the new design,After scanning an item you get basic info and comments.  Comments are the least important to me.
3206,3206,4,2015-01-05T21:02:04.000Z,Jdubbs2015,Really good for dieting,I love this app for tracking and grading food!! I just wish when you went to add your food for the day  it told you what the serving size was so you don't have to hunt it down.
3207,3207,5,2015-03-02T14:40:31.000Z,C0ffeeGuy,So far great app,"Just got it yesterday, very impressed so far. If things continue to be impressive I will be purchasing the upgrades. Good job guys"
3208,3208,5,2015-04-21T21:31:06.000Z,Chadjdavis,Great!,"The best food tracking app because it goes beyond counting calories and instead focuses on the quality of the food!! Whole Foods, minimally processed!"
3209,3209,5,2015-04-25T13:08:34.000Z,Leedaddy,Has everything I need,I wanted an app that would keep track of my food intake as well as my exercise. Great app!
3210,3210,5,2013-04-08T16:48:38.000Z,Manasota,Great info,I like being able to get information and ratings before or while I shop. Very helpful app.
3211,3211,5,2013-04-10T20:21:32.000Z,Michael Ney,Great app for making healthy food choices,I really enjoy this app'. It simpifies the decision-making process when shopping at the supermarket.

3215,3215,4,2013-04-26T12:43:47.000Z,Kevin Stump,Fast and informational,The only improvement I'd be happy to see now is their exercise tab. The number of calories that they estimate you burned is inaccurate- overestimating how much you've burned. Fix it for a five!!!
3216,3216,5,2013-05-17T04:43:23.000Z,RR1974,Super!!,"Does everything it promised to do, and does it quickly and w/out any hassle. Fantastic at tracking specific foods."

3218,3218,2,2013-06-27T19:01:45.000Z,anderstew,While it seems like a great app...,"I can't stand the ""connect to iTunes to get push notifications.  I'm connected but every 2 seconds...literally, this message pops up on your app.  Others do it, but only once.  Your app really doesn't function with it.  I can't stand it...driving me batty!!!"

3220,3220,5,2013-01-04T04:19:19.000Z,ZanahK84,Love it!,It's great for knowing what's good and bad for you. Stuff I thought was healthy-horrible for you. We have been watching our diets but this helps out so much!!!!
3221,3221,3,2013-01-11T14:40:16.000Z,lolitabones,It was working great until,"Today it logged me out (odd) and I can't log in. I tried resetting the password and it does not recognize any of my two possible emails. Help! :( I dis the update but that didn't help. (And I'm sure I made an accout, I don't like using FB to login)"
3222,3222,3,2013-01-22T01:31:08.000Z,Greggo44,Fast food database limited,"OK, I shouldn't eat fast food but I travel a lot and have limited options. I find the fast food availability in the database very limited so as to almost be unusable, even less data for the restaurant chains that are not fast food."
3223,3223,5,2013-01-28T20:31:12.000Z,Bigdpnc,Knowledge is power!,Take your health back from agrobusiness..know what you are eating. This is a well designed app to give the power back to consumers !
3224,3224,4,2013-01-29T14:41:28.000Z,VACEO,iPhone user,I like the app a lot-I find it limited in the number of products but I'm doing my part by following the steps to add products when I find them not availab1
3225,3225,5,2013-02-08T22:24:38.000Z,Brad8949,Best app ever!,"This app opened my eyes so much!  I always thought I was eating healthy, but apparently my choices had several hidden ingredients that I disregarded.  This app is wonderful!!!"
3226,3226,5,2013-02-21T15:16:42.000Z,Hailey22395,Love it!,"So helpful in telling me what foods are good, and what foods are bad. I've been a little surprised that some foods that I thought were good, are actually bad. Thanks fooducate! And thanks to Austin Andrews for recommending this app."
3227,3227,5,2013-02-25T20:08:59.000Z,Foody87,Awesome!,This has almost everything to stay informed and to track your food intake - would love them to add summaries of daily protein and fat too

3238,3238,2,2012-12-09T18:06:24.000Z,brennanMKE,Poor scanner and limited data,I often have a clear shot of the barcode but the scanner does not work. Other apps do with the same barcode. That's frustrating. I also often find items are not in the database so the app is often useless.
3239,3239,5,2012-12-31T19:50:59.000Z,KaterinaT15,Life saver!,I'm very health conscious and this app has saved me time & time again from buying unhealthy food! I scan EVERYTHING before I put it in my mouth. This app is great!
3240,3240,4,2012-01-21T19:50:21.000Z,rcws1,Great app,Now they need to speed up the time it takes whenever you send them information to update product info
3241,3241,5,2012-01-29T00:37:26.000Z,dhfkaf,One of my favorite apps,This is an excellent app and one everyone that is interested in health and weight control should have and use!
3242,3242,5,2012-02-04T23:59:38.000Z,manbearpig2006,Awesome app for foodies,Love this app it let's you look up food and also submit new ones. I use it all the time web I'm at the grocery store.
3243,3243,5,2012-02-06T10:53:43.000Z,Lms619,Love it,Fantastic tool for making better choices when shopping. Thank you!
3244,3244,5,2012-02-11T17:23:36.000Z,damecaite42,Very practical and easy to use,"Easy to use and informative! Easy to submit new products, too!"
3245,3245,5,2012-02-15T20:38:07.000Z,Jmariestock,Excellent app!!,This is the best best best app! I am more aware of what I am eating thanks to fooducate. Not only am I told what is in my food but it explains exactly what the ingredients are and why they are healthy or not. brilliant!
3246,3246,4,2012-03-04T21:30:52.000Z,cat on a hot tin roof,Fun but some results questionable,A very fun and useful app. I particularly like that it offers healthier options for items under review. My only reservation is that it seems to consider natural sugars just as bad as added fructose.
3247,3247,4,2012-03-12T21:08:39.000Z,MandeepSingh_socal,Great app,This is a great app. I hope it gets more personalized information about the products than some of generic information.
3248,3248,5,2012-04-01T04:43:08.000Z,Trogan1,Very informative,I love the way you can find out so much about the foods you eat. A wealth of info for those who care about what they are eating. Excellent app.
3249,3249,5,2012-04-02T03:18:39.000Z,Jennbaby1976,Jennbaby35,Real user friendly . But would love if they got newer products so you wouldn't have to wait and see if there good
3250,3250,5,2011-07-04T22:48:19.000Z,AMWstudio,Artist,Super cool app and one of the most useful! They notify you when a product that wasn't in the database is added.  Easy to use. Good consumer information!
3251,3251,5,2011-07-18T02:38:41.000Z,Melissy91,Love!,This food app is unlike no other! I love it! It actually shows how a lot of times food companies lie about how healthy their products are.
3252,3252,5,2011-07-18T04:21:16.000Z,shanken1295,Still can't believe,I still can't believe this app was free! So full of good advice! It opens up options that I wouldn't have thought of!

3254,3254,5,2011-08-24T17:18:56.000Z,Josefrijoles,Great,"I've found some good knowledge about a few poor things I eat or drink now and then that are just no good. Simple, informative and even sort of fun."
3255,3255,5,2011-10-02T14:43:10.000Z,1brown1,Great tool,This is an excellent app in terms of monitoring the food you select and assisting in making wise choices. Also good for point of sale use
3256,3256,5,2011-11-13T06:32:53.000Z,TNT13.1,Great App!!!,I never knew what I was eating was so unhealthy!  Quickly scans!! Provides alternatives - I've learned so much from the descriptions! Has changed my way of shopping!
3257,3257,5,2011-11-20T23:16:28.000Z,Meganev23,Very handy and educational,"Great App! I am on a scanning frenzy.. Have all my friends hooked, too. Really like learning all the different words for things like sugar, MSG etc. a must have!"
3258,3258,5,2011-12-05T05:48:40.000Z,Axlereid,Diet Delighter,Has changed the way I look at food. Fantastic app that delivers immediate feedback with a clear and concise approach that makes shopping for food fun.
3259,3259,5,2012-01-13T00:24:03.000Z,Janee Sue,Great App!,It is very interesting to find out that some choices that you think are healthy  are not the best. This app will make you food smart!
3260,3260,5,2011-01-08T00:20:16.000Z,jhh42,Good Fun,"After downloading today, I went around my office and scanned my officemates snacks. Very easy to use. Surprising how bad the grade some of the ""nutrition"" bars get! Everyone was fascinated by the app."
3261,3261,1,2011-01-26T14:04:25.000Z,the original macmadman,Awkward and pretty useless,"Does not let me scan with my iPod Touch. Just sits there waiting for me to scan, but nothing I do will make it scan. I use scanning apps for other things and they work. Don't know why this one won't. Nothing here, or on their website, gives me information on this issue."
3262,3262,5,2011-04-29T17:46:45.000Z,Spike47568,Perfect 10!,App is perfect! It would be cool to see all the nutritional facts for each product. And the same feature to compare them. Thanks!
3263,3263,5,2016-02-24T20:44:28.000Z,WalkFit,Fooducate,Love this app! Use the barcode scanner all the time at the grocery store. Even my grandson knows his requests for foods have to be evaluated. Good nutrition education for him! Love their emails too.
3264,3264,5,2016-05-23T01:03:28.000Z,Allenemyz,Losing weight,This is probably the better of all the calorie counter apps. Ive lost 5lbs in a week and I already am feeling better. Thanks guys :)
3265,3265,3,2016-09-19T00:34:33.000Z,Miachooo,Eh,I was really excited to finally find an app that caters to a gluten allergy but when I had to pay for a special diet I was disappointed. Looks like it could have really helped but I don't want to spend any extra money right now.
3266,3266,4,2016-11-15T18:45:49.000Z,Mograce,Comprehensive!,I love that it tracks macronutrients and sugars!  Only bad thing is that to add something new I have to type everything when they could just as easily do it.
3267,3267,5,2016-12-27T23:32:58.000Z,Ladywebb,Awesome App,Just downloaded this app and I love it. I'm trying to eat healthier and this app is helping me make better food choices. A must for anyone that is health conscious.
3268,3268,5,2017-01-30T04:38:46.000Z,foodtrackerperson,Good for calories and nutrition,I like how this app gives you calorie tracking but also gives you more detailed nutrition - like a breakdown of carbs vs fat vs protein.
3269,3269,1,2017-03-12T15:19:07.000Z,MissMary03,Logged me out and can't get back in,This app logged me out. I cannot get back in. I've tried resetting my password and then logging in but I hit log in and it won't do anything. Just sits on that screen. If I try to create a new account it won't let me because my email is already being using. Was a good app until this happened.
3270,3270,5,2014-06-03T21:05:49.000Z,Ericab0127,Great app!,"I love this all it's so easy to use, and I Still haven't found a food that wasn't available to scan"
3271,3271,3,2014-06-18T16:58:09.000Z,SammieDavisJrJr,Please Fix the Banner,"50% of the time when I open the app, a banner for Soy Milk is displayed. When I close the ad my screen remains white. Very annoying and problem still occurs when I close the app and reopen it."
3272,3272,4,2014-07-07T13:57:45.000Z,AuntieAnneToo,Useful app,I appreciate being able to compare various brands of the foods that I use. The food tracking feature is useful in keeping me aware of how much I have eaten in a day.
3273,3273,5,2014-09-06T15:26:49.000Z,New cyclist 2,An app that helps,So amazed by the extent of info already stored and the ability to submit more...from everywhere!
3274,3274,5,2015-01-01T18:44:06.000Z,Eloquent 1,Terrific App,The app does exactly what it's supposed to do! It works well and if I can't find my item I can simply put it in the database.
3275,3275,5,2015-03-19T10:11:00.000Z,Sashimi Barbie,Love this app!,Use it at the store and I make decisions based on their informative ratings. Really feel like I'm improving my health. Love monitoring my workouts and weight.

3277,3277,4,2015-05-29T21:18:51.000Z,Cactus White,Nutrition is everything to me right now,Just got it And enjoying the scanning feature. I am putting together a healthy diet so I will update at a later date withy results
3278,3278,1,2015-07-26T20:50:09.000Z,Fleshwreck,Don't upgrade to premium,I upgraded to premium and didn't get what I was expecting so I've been trying to cancel. It automatically renews every month but no one will respond to my emails and there is no option in the app to cancel. I'm going to have to have my bank stop payment on them. No customer service at all.
3279,3279,4,2015-11-10T16:40:40.000Z,Saltydoc58,Pretty good so far,Just started. Good info. Educates as to your food selections. For some reason it gives grilled salmon a less than A rating without explanation. What could be more healthy than fresh wild fish on the grill?
3280,3280,5,2013-07-03T13:35:51.000Z,Mccommonp,Love this app,"I love this app. I was so shocked what is ""good"" and ""bad"" the other day at the store. I had 3 other women ask me to scan their food also. Needless to say they all got the app."
3281,3281,5,2013-08-14T13:04:28.000Z,tmfriend,Great app!,Very pleased with this app! It definitely helps keep me on track. Love the fact it offers better food choices.
3282,3282,2,2013-10-26T00:49:43.000Z,Jon Sig,Read the TOS,Deleted after installing after reading the required TOS. Thought it was interesting requiring agreement without requiring an account.
3283,3283,5,2014-01-05T21:54:28.000Z,Tomas P,OUTSTANDING App!!!!,"Man am I glad I found and installed this app - what a gem it is! Lookup, Scan, Plan, etc ... I especially like the RATINGS if various foods and WHAT is CAUSING that food item to have that rating. I also like the option to SUBMIT items currently not in their database and have them add it in :)"
3284,3284,4,2014-01-17T18:06:39.000Z,Ohio man,Love the letter grade,"I love the letter grade and how it creates an understanding that just because low-fat doesn't equal great for you. Only disappointment is the catalog of foods seems limited for food that was ""verified"" and gives you a true reading."
3285,3285,5,2014-03-20T23:14:17.000Z,Must have food tracking app,Great weight watching app,Love this app for watching what I eat. It keeps track of everything! I especially like the grade it gives.
3286,3286,5,2014-03-22T13:43:20.000Z,ItsDru,Loveeee it!,I feel like this app always has the food I have in my house and it helps me decide what to buy at the grocery store
3287,3287,5,2014-03-30T15:01:06.000Z,Pokefanrox,Good for losing weight,This app helps me to eat right food instead of junky food. That is most powerful and helpful to all people.
3288,3288,5,2014-05-24T23:38:35.000Z,Flex_King,Lose weight it really works,This app helps you to control and watch what you eat I absolutely love it

3290,3290,5,2012-09-27T01:42:42.000Z,Sugie 2,Surely enjoying this app,The usage of this app has kept me from buying what I thought was a good choice.  So I then made a better purchase.
3291,3291,5,2012-10-17T21:25:44.000Z,Jeyacrux,It works pretty well,I like that have detail information of the products.
3292,3292,5,2013-01-10T11:58:20.000Z,Rsurg,Love it!!,"I am a nutritionist and love the fact that this app is accurate, user-friendly, and has great blogs/tips of the day. Everyone needs this app!"
3293,3293,4,2013-03-14T15:22:46.000Z,Anakalia76,"Great app, one suggestion","I have a four because it is a great app, but if you added a fat tracker option under goals ( just like calories and carbs) it will be even better."
3294,3294,5,2013-03-23T18:06:23.000Z,Anya D Night,Great App,Cuts through some of the healthy and faux healthy lingo on product labels and gives you a solid point of comparison to make good choices.

3402,3402,4,2014-06-22T21:17:37.000Z,SMG 691,Overall Great,I use it to track my calories and learn about different foods. I just don't like when the don't have the food I've scanned in their database. Great over-all

3407,3407,5,2015-10-07T13:39:08.000Z,Aerie1344,Great health app,I love this. Especially how it rates food on how processed it is. I try to eat minimally processed foods mostly and the scanner is great when I'm food shopping and I love the health tracker.

3415,3415,3,2013-08-02T00:05:33.000Z,Jforn3,Review,This app is helpful but I don't always agree with the grading given to particular foods. There are also many foods evaluated that are not available in my area. Many of the ones that are available are not evaluated.
3416,3416,5,2013-08-06T00:54:22.000Z,HolChMama,Great app!,I love this app it helps me live an organic natural life style! I always scan products I'm unsure about its good to know what's really in the food you're buying. Awesome!

3421,3421,2,2013-01-08T17:51:52.000Z,Sov514,Looks good but falls short,Good idea but poor follow through. Their database is kind if useless. At least for me. I tried scanning the bar codes of everything I ate and not one returned a result. Pretty difficult to get data without that. I know I can go in and enter it manually but that defeats the purpose of the app.
3422,3422,5,2013-01-24T22:23:41.000Z,Irishgal73,Great app!!,This app has helped with making better food choices and keeping me on track.

3447,3447,1,2012-05-26T13:29:31.000Z,Not for me now,Used to adore; now not so much,"To use this you now have to sign up. This app WAS awesome, now you have to sign up, it wants to track where you are, etc. like so many other apps. (I turn off this function--uses too much battery.) prior to sign up it was wonderful. If have to continually sign it will be deleted & I will start using WW app for scanning!"

3551,3551,4,2013-03-14T02:26:59.000Z,blytherk,An Idea,There should be a section of easy recipes that show the nutritional value. For instance a guacamole recipe. Maybe have a section that recommends more vitamin A or something the diet seems to be lacking.

I tried scanning a lot of things during a trip to fresh and easy and this app could only identify about 30% of them. I was disappointed.

If little red numbers on top of you app icon annoy you -- going to read a message only to get a marketing shpeel (as it really annoys me) -- it'll bug you. Maybe they'll change it. If they did, THAT would be message worthy."

3599,3599,5,2011-08-14T01:59:57.000Z,Metal Flowerz,Son Knew Best!,My son wanted me to get this app so that he can make healthier food choices & we have. We've both have lost weight and eat healthier now.
3600,3600,5,2014-10-06T21:50:14.000Z,ld1468,Excellent,Using the free version. Very useful information for weight loss and determining the nutritional value of many foods along with offering alternatives.

3604,3604,3,2016-04-18T04:46:39.000Z,Sarahluv:),"Informative, but not quite there yet","The way this app grades your food is eye opening, but its database pales in comparison to My Fitness Pal. They just need to work on getting more complete information about food from restaurants, and update menus from chains like Noodles and Co and CPK."
3605,3605,5,2016-04-27T08:28:33.000Z,Donna St.John's Tunes,Really helpful :)),"Being visual, it helps me to stay on track re: health & exercise. The pro version is good as it lets me know what's paleo, pescaterian, etc."
3606,3606,4,2016-12-28T17:28:41.000Z,Turbanek,Pretty good,"Some food portions don't have a size for calories given. Would like to see carbs counted, body measurements instead of just weight for progress in free version."
3607,3607,2,2017-01-09T00:43:43.000Z,RoseS-Ja17,Disappointed,"Wanted an app to journal my foods to replace another older app. Enjoyed the Community, and the Healthy Recipes. After just 1 week, my user name & password are no longer valid. I've deleted this app from my phone, and will resort to using my personal computer to log my foods."
3608,3608,5,2017-04-15T16:25:46.000Z,lvzap,User friendly!,Super easy to use and perfect way to know what you're consuming.

3639,3639,4,2013-02-20T19:26:37.000Z,Katehc,Wonder for food info,It tells you WW points. The nutritional info. Potential risk. A food score. The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 stars is because there are a lot of foods not listed.

3689,3689,3,2017-02-01T14:50:34.000Z,Kevin C Pride,Ok food tracker,Missing a lot of major products. And the subscription fees on here are ridiculous. I know payments are they way to wealth but this app goes way too far. 4.99 per month to remove ads.

3693,3693,5,2014-01-04T15:26:11.000Z,Kwottley,More than a calorie counter,Better than Losit & MyFitnessPal. Learn about the foods you consume and search for healthier alternatives with this app. Love the concept of the app.

3700,3700,3,2013-03-26T16:48:32.000Z,MacDadE99,Would be perfect with minor modifications,"This is the best nutrition calculator app that I have found in terms of scanning capability, nutrition database and ease of use.  It would be perfect if it had the capability to track all primary nutritional components including: calories, carbs, protein and fats."
3701,3701,2,2013-05-09T15:34:26.000Z,alliegold3,Idea is great but limited foods in database,"I knew that the database sucked when I typed in ""spinach"" in my grocery list, and some spinach nugget/patty option came up. I then realized we don't need apps like this if you're eating normal, whole and non processed foods."
3702,3702,5,2013-05-10T18:11:20.000Z,EnnEssAtsh,Awesome,The app is awesome!! Great!! Love it!!! Just make the location world wide and increase the choices of the food so it can be better. Food scans are so limited!

3710,3710,1,2012-11-10T15:20:40.000Z,Ret Dutchman,Does not work,"Looks like a good app. Can not log in so I don't know it it does what it says it does. Sets up account but, when you enter e-mail address, won't let you select or use your password--just kicks you out of the app completely.  Have to start all over each time without getting in one time."

I've submitted several foods myself; awaiting their inclusion. I also submitted a correction for a mis-labelled item."

3732,3732,1,2011-11-14T01:42:01.000Z,Youmakemezoom,Misleading,"The app works wonderfully- but the info is misleading. Packaged and processed foods are not good for you! Although of course we all eat them, and therefore the should be included, they should not show up as alternatives for fresh, lower salt, unprocessed foods. I hate to think of the damage this app might do for people who are looking for help to make better choices."

3741,3741,4,2011-04-25T22:09:14.000Z,Sojmeister,Awesome,"They don't have every item but they have the major ones. Usually it just confirms what you already know: processed=bad for you, but it's still a great resource."
3742,3742,5,2011-05-27T23:27:51.000Z,Julieh9r,Love this app!!,I would pay money for this app if I had to. Easy for daughter to help me when grocery shopping too:)

3749,3749,5,2011-08-30T21:24:00.000Z,Chablis7359,Review,Love this app makes u not want to eat the food you've been eating. I'm having so much scanning food to see what it's rated.
3750,3750,1,2015-02-19T01:15:43.000Z,Harvard Registered Dietitian,RD,"Wow. Fooducate has been really disappointing. As a Registered Dietitian with a Masters in Public Health that trained at Harvard, this app makes false statements about many well-studied  products. I think they need to rethink how they do research instead of knocking how others do research.  Glad to know they are funded by the pharma companies. I guess it all comes back to who is funding who Fooducate."
3751,3751,5,2015-06-03T04:13:55.000Z,vladdtar,Very useful!,"I use this app all the time when I go grocery shopping. It is a very nice complement to the ""just buy organic"" rule of thumb."
3752,3752,2,2015-09-25T05:24:15.000Z,Tango dancers,Frustrated,New upgrade has frozen several times today. I have been unable to upload calories burned from exercise. The prior version worked really well. I hope this version gets fixed soon!

3755,3755,5,2016-09-23T18:38:16.000Z,The Amazing Annabelle,This app is Amazing,When I first got it I scanned a few things and ever since I have been losing weight it's amazing
3756,3756,3,2016-11-03T22:54:59.000Z,Constance,Ok but loads slowly,"I like a lot of the features here but it takes forever to load.  I keep getting ""request timed out"" notices.  It's frustrating when it takes to long to enter my meals."

3760,3760,4,2013-11-25T17:43:33.000Z,Sean & Cathy,Great app,Great app to use to check out nutrition of foods in store and see what you are eating! Don't like the fact you have to upgrade and pay to customize and add dietary restrictions.

I don't want to click on the app just to see my ""diet partner"" you've assigned to me - especially one who just posts about WATER. Please take that feature away or let us choose our own. Not even sure this app is worth keeping now."
3768,3768,4,2014-08-16T16:47:28.000Z,davara64,Almost perfect....,"Very helpful app, but I'm not seeing anything about the Glycemic Index.  Would be so helpful to see the glycemic index rating when you scan items."
3769,3769,5,2014-12-17T14:04:21.000Z,Jmac383847,Incredible,So many useful features and very easy to use
3770,3770,1,2013-04-08T01:46:09.000Z,DaniM0512,"Good info, but useless as a tracker","The info on processed foods is good, but ultimately it's useless as a food tracker. I can't enter in my own foods (for example, if I were to make meatloaf or something from scratch, I wouldn't have the nutrition info available and can't track it). It would have been great if this one change were made."
3771,3771,5,2013-04-15T14:43:26.000Z,amyjack85,I love it,This is the best food/grocery/calorie counter app out there! The scanner comes in handy when out and about!

3776,3776,5,2013-06-03T21:47:33.000Z,Brdbutwootsvdme,Awesome,Awesome awesome awesomeness. Highly recommend. Except you'll be shocked to see how much of the food in your cabinets contains GMOs. I got this app strictly for the GMO alert just by scanning the barcode.

3780,3780,1,2012-11-16T18:16:16.000Z,Non-organic,GM food is safe,"Deleted this app since it is misleading to ""warn"" about GMOs.  Why don't you warn about all the foods created by chemical mutations and that are not assessed for safety?  Oh--that would be most of the organic stuff.  Foods are only labeled by FDA when there is a health reason to do so.  FDA does not require labeling of food with GM ingredients since they are safe.  Why do you think you are more knowledgeable?"
3781,3781,5,2012-11-22T18:21:27.000Z,Oooooooopo,Enlightening,You think you have a healthy pantry Til you scan and realize all the junk in food!

3802,3802,4,2011-11-15T01:06:40.000Z,Abiistre,Great App,Really like this app..... I do agree with a prior post that this app can lead you astray a bit but if already know how to eat healthy you will notice and can make your own choice.  :)
3803,3803,4,2011-12-06T20:50:59.000Z,lesl¬•,Nice!!!,I really like this appt. it has help decided or make a decision about certain foods. I like it not so much because I keep a diet but because I like to know what I put in my body and this appt helps me with that.
3804,3804,5,2012-01-03T17:37:56.000Z,Canyon Girl,Love It!,Can't believe it's free. The clerks at the supermarket think I'm up to something when I shop. It really helps me make smarter choices. Thanks for the great app!
3805,3805,3,2012-01-17T04:19:45.000Z,"Trust me, I'm not a hipster","Educational, but shopping list is no use","This app is very educational giving critical information on ingredients to be aware of. However, the shopping list is incredibly cumbersome to use, and of no value."
3806,3806,5,2012-02-21T19:47:25.000Z,TimDreamz,Awesome app!!!,Great app and very informative about food products. Helps me decide which healthier food options to choose from.

3809,3809,2,2012-04-14T22:59:36.000Z,Matt Bernstein,Strength and conditioning coach,"The app works just fine, however the ratings on food is far from correct. Why are we still eating food on science that is unfounded and making us more sick???  Giving any product with a processed quality an ""A"" helps no one."
3810,3810,5,2011-07-09T22:19:32.000Z,Autumnharvest,Helpful,Great app. I love how you can compare 2 similar products to see which one is better for you.

3820,3820,4,2011-04-18T14:22:27.000Z,Meggy80,Love it!,This is a great app but it just needs to expand its database of products. It has the potential to change the way you eat for the better.

3833,3833,1,2015-08-31T04:37:38.000Z,CanNeverCancel,Can never cancel monthly paid subscription,"Be aware the you can not cancel the monthly paid subscription unless you remove your credit card information from iTunes, but then that also cancels any other subscription. What a scam!!!!!!  No response to emails. No response from support."
3834,3834,5,2015-12-21T16:35:06.000Z,Officeday,Love it,Excellent app for tracking daily intake. Awesome scanning mode to auto impute nutritional label data. Highly recommend it. You WILL watch what you eat!!

3842,3842,3,2014-01-21T06:38:20.000Z,Meanus57,Good basic app,"The app is great for someone willing to settle for generally accepted nutritional standards.  Not very helpful for those interested in a Paleo lifestyle, without use of grains, legumes, most dairy and of course sugar.  A balanced diet of meats, vegetables, fruits and nuts doesn't seem to rate very high with the creators of this app."
3843,3843,4,2014-05-21T23:42:23.000Z,Nina Graff,Love this app but hate the renew fee,I have the upgraded version and it is so much better. I wish it was a one time fee instead of every three months. Great app.

4228,4228,5,2011-08-22T19:09:28.000Z,Jmb439,My new favorite app,I love using this app everyday. It tracks everything I eat and it is very easy to use.
4229,4229,4,2011-08-29T19:05:14.000Z,llwberg,Handy,It is a very handy app to have. It gives you information that you can't seem to get in other places.
4230,4230,5,2011-05-17T01:33:48.000Z,Lelewell75,Good app,This thing makes it much easier to navigate through all the nutritional facts.
4231,4231,5,2014-07-27T15:16:28.000Z,Reesmer97,Great app!,"Love this app when shopping....super helpful especially around added colorings, flavorings etc."
4232,4232,4,2014-08-22T12:33:01.000Z,Chenzncharlie,Solid food tracker,I would like to see more cooked food added and verified. It has a ton of of the shelf stuff but lacks in things like butcher bought meats.
4233,4233,5,2014-10-14T18:16:49.000Z,Pmb0827,LOVE THIS APP!!! Lifesaver!!,"This app is great for people who have kids, or want to keep track of what they're eating, but don't have a clue how to count calories."

4236,4236,1,2015-10-27T23:04:19.000Z,Good for brain,Fitness pal better,Fitness pal which is free gives better variety and breath and length of food choices. Fooducate doesn't seem to have a lot of natural food choices easily found. I have had to go to fitness pal to find out information to manually enter on the fooducate new food list.
4237,4237,1,2016-03-29T05:56:26.000Z,Literary Fan,Premium is a ripoff!,"Inaccurate and time consuming. The free version of My Fitness Pal is a thousand times better. This is cumbersome, doesn't sync with Fitbit other than via another app, requires you to upgrade to premium to get basic nutritional info, and doesn't provide weekly or monthly info. Useless!"
4238,4238,5,2016-04-11T16:44:22.000Z,Ksofidnkd,Excellent App,This app is excellent for tracking nutritional info about the food you eat. Very comprehensive nutritional data.

4243,4243,5,2014-01-31T00:34:25.000Z,Mastrbrewr,Great tracker,Tracking is simple. I really appreciate the food grades and food education available.

4255,4255,3,2013-04-11T19:01:39.000Z,cfitch13,Not quite enough detail,"I really like the app but it doesn't give a daily detail total or running total of fat, protein and carbs which I also need to keep track of."
4256,4256,5,2013-04-23T14:14:07.000Z,Atlanta Grandma,Reading Teacher,I use this app all the time!  It really helps  me in choosing healthy food!

4261,4261,1,2012-05-28T16:45:50.000Z,Tnwrn,Doesn't work,The latest upgrade required me to register with Facebook which I reluctantly did.  Now I can't access my list and when I scan a barcode it gets stuck finding the product.  Please bring back the previous version.
4262,4262,5,2012-06-04T23:42:47.000Z,Kimberly shad,Accurate,I don't grocery shop without it
4263,4263,5,2012-06-12T17:12:46.000Z,rbateson,Wonderful,Very educational. Use this for vending machine cravings and you will definitely start bringing your own snacks to work!

4269,4269,2,2013-01-10T13:02:33.000Z,inferno313,Terrible!!!!,The app doesn't have one food item I am looking for. I thought it would be a good way to look up weight watchers points. Apparently not. Use Calorie Counter by MyFitness. Still not everything but there is more than on this app.
4270,4270,5,2012-02-26T20:54:26.000Z,rparkc,Great!,Its so helpful! Thank you! I especially love the scanner! Very useful when stores dont let you know (:

4299,4299,1,2011-11-13T17:18:25.000Z,Mothyberry,Good idea.. But for iPad...?,"I am reviewing this app for iPad. If you are like most iPad users and you only have wifi, this app is next to useless. You can only scan items if you are on wifi that second. There is no option to scan it first and look it up later (not hard to integrate) and there is no native iPad app."
4300,4300,5,2011-05-28T03:38:40.000Z,April1041,WOW! Fooducate is legit.,"User friendly. Never crashes. And seriously gives you an entirely different perspective on acclaimed ""good"" or ""whole"" foods. Thanks for the great app Fooducate Team!!!"

4307,4307,5,2011-07-24T01:53:41.000Z,Bopperbop,Must have,Great app!  I never realized that all the healthy organic food I was eating was also loaded with tons of sugar and other additives.
4308,4308,5,2011-07-29T02:37:25.000Z,Victim 7,Cool,Very informative. Even if I don't always listen to the fact that what I'm eating is bad at least now I know WHY it's bad for me!

4318,4318,1,2016-07-15T05:00:15.000Z,Anjarielle,"Misleading, needs improvement","It's a start, but a lot of the guidelines are not necessarily helpful. Many yellow foods are very high in saturated and trans fats and sugars. Labeling them as ""yellow"" is very misleading. Additionally, there are a few instances of multiple entries and different scores for the exact same items. Needs to have better regulation and consistency."
4319,4319,4,2016-10-21T22:17:22.000Z,Wilson97734,Love the scanner,Pro seems interesting but it's too expensive for what it's advertised. Overall like though

4323,4323,1,2014-05-27T19:43:11.000Z,ASAUCEY,Too many duplicates,There are too many duplicate products within this app with different ratings and information. This product needs some matching logic to create some sort if master record. It is very confusing as I'm not sure what is the correct information.
4324,4324,4,2014-07-08T18:24:37.000Z,Entertainment 1,Healthy Lifestyle Encourager,I love this app. It not only helps me with my goals but it also helps me keep my family healthy. Keeping me informed on what is really in our foods.

4334,4334,3,2013-04-23T23:44:13.000Z,Littlemissmushi,Missing information,"I looked up over a dozen items known to contain GMOs and they weren't listed. Also, foods are rated b that have a ton of sugar and calories for the serving size! It does give warnings for things like bht and caramel color."

4378,4378,5,2011-08-31T04:44:01.000Z,Team Pitnick,A favorite app,I'm scanning everything in my kitchen. Some items won't be invited back. Very informative.
4379,4379,4,2011-09-04T16:12:53.000Z,twillstein,Everything I eat is garbage.,Very helpful. Shows you that the 'healthy' food you buy may not be what you think.

4383,4383,4,2014-06-08T19:03:39.000Z,Maksta13,Great app,Awesome service use it all the time. The reason I did not give 5 stars was some foods ratings need to be a little more accurate.
4384,4384,1,2014-06-28T19:34:08.000Z,Butchjax,Useless when login doesn't work,In the previous versions no login was needed. I opened it in the store and it just worked. Now I open it and every login and signup option won't work leaving the app useless. So not happy. Logins are not necessary to scan food! Just let me use it.
4385,4385,4,2014-09-02T23:41:05.000Z,Heidbdbs,Love it,Love this app! Just wish it synced with Fitbit... Would make tracking food SO much easier. Got my whole family hooked on it :)

4403,4403,4,2013-04-20T00:17:56.000Z,Habeus,Very practical,Would enjoy healthier options of a wider variety than what I might find at a Whole Foods Market.  I'm ok with non-organic and that could be indicated.
4404,4404,1,2013-04-20T01:39:33.000Z,lockpro,Very Suspect,"I think this app is a wolf in Sheep's clothing. I checked 3 products known to contain GMO's which were not disclosed by this app. Further, it advised me to ""save money"" and not buy certain organic fruits and veggies because the conventional varieties are not sprayed with anything that sticks around on or in the product. Wrong. I'd like to know who is really behind this app."
4405,4405,5,2013-04-28T02:53:56.000Z,DMar G,Great app,Has plenty of items in its database and makes submitting new ones easy.
4406,4406,3,2013-05-02T16:55:36.000Z,meschmid,Super app.  It helps just to keep track of your choice of food and the calorie content.,This app makes you stop and think of better choices to incorporate in your diet.

4412,4412,3,2013-01-05T22:11:04.000Z,5639joey,Okay,I like having the information and alternatives but I don't like that you can't edit...if you accidentally tap something you're stuck with it

4418,4418,2,2013-04-04T15:41:50.000Z,DEn2e,Exercise time options are poor,I feel an update needs to be made to allow the time selections to be in 5 min intervals rather than 15 min. Sometimes I walk/run for 40 min. 30 min isn't enough time and picking 45 feels like cheating.
4419,4419,5,2013-04-05T14:44:04.000Z,Anne of the woods,Awesome app!!,I'm addicted. It's shocking to find out some of what is being touted as healthy is really awful for you.

And the factoids are so simple that if you don't know them, you shouldn't really be feeding yourself. I mean ""contains natural or artificial sweeteners""?  I mean, really."

5343,5343,2,2012-07-20T04:44:40.000Z,Sgolenbo,Dumb and arbitrary,Only fun thing is the 'beep' when you scan something. Tells you nothing useful or informed about any particular foods--except maybe that sugar or too many ingredients are inherently bad. Don't bother.

5617,5617,1,2015-11-08T16:29:25.000Z,Openbook1441,"App Trap, no way to cancel","DO NOT pay money for anything on this app, they'll never stop charging you. Even contacting them in writing by email requesting to cancel your subscription will not get the job done. Don't waste your money with this scam."
5618,5618,5,2016-03-30T13:43:07.000Z,jbb62,"Best app of its kind - visuals, info, positive msgs, customer support","I had Fooducate when I was just getting into the whole food tracking thing and loved it right away. So much so that every other one I tried fell short. And still does. Like any app, you have to log your food. But you can scan it, create recipes, and it‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs NOT a big deal. If you are invested enough in what goes into your body, this is part of it. I was fascinated by what I didn‚Äôt even realize ‚Äî especially how many carbs I was mindlessly getting. What I LOVE about this app is the easy graphics but also the unmatched scope of its info, and its whole attitude. Instead of feeling like I was depriving myself of something, it gave me GOALS. Getting enough protein has always been a struggle for me so this made it a goal. How close did I get to achieving that goal as the day went on? Well if I was only halfway there, I guess dinner had to be some salmon or chicken instead of corn flakes! EASY. It‚Äôs also one of the few apps that factors in things that are important - dietary plans chemicals and processed foods,gluten, vegetarian, allergies, etc. I know My Fitness Pal is getting a ton of play right now thanks to Under Armour‚Äôs financial backing but I‚Äôve used both and went running back to Fooducate.  I have been hassling their customer service for a week now because I had paid for an unlimited subscription that I thought I didn‚Äôt get back, but it was right there. I would like them to make the upgraded version a different logo so you could tell the difference. I find this to be the most user friendly, make you make good choices, not punish you when you don‚Äôt, adapt to your personal preferences, food tracker out there. It incorporates the exercise calories burned as reported by my fitness tracker too. FOR SURE GET FOODUCATE."

Foods containing high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil are listed as better choices over organic foods based on sugar content. Really????? Dessert is usually a splurge that is going to be high in sugar.

6333,6333,1,2013-05-10T00:19:40.000Z,Zews 01,Cute and useless.,"Limited database. Many scanned items cannot be found. Inane alternative suggestions, unless I want to shop in 11 different stores every time I shop for food."

They gave Tyson chicken products an A?! Really? Such factory farm, hormone injected, mechanically separated food gets an F in my book!"

6615,6615,3,2013-02-13T16:02:24.000Z,Aye Vee,Its nice at the grocery store but,The food tracker leaves much to be desired. I can't enter fast food or a cooked meal unless I go ingredient by ingredient.

It has help me to make better food choices for myself and family. Learning how to read food labels can be hard, not only do you need to know how to read them but you need to know all of the big words that go along with the labelüò≥. This program has made it idiot proof. It breaks it all done for you and explains the who's, what and whyüòä. To add a grading system A - D for rating the product was brilliant üëç. And yes ....it is true it takes a few weeks for them to get the products that you have requested but they are nice enough to send you an e-mail that states it is going to take time due to the number of request that they receive and you will be notified once they have your information for the product you have requested. üÜó.... It is not the end of the world. My suggestion is to eat something else until the information is sent to you. It is what I doüòâ."

7857,7857,5,2015-10-02T12:38:59.000Z,elannae,Just what I needed!,"Several days ago I came home after my workout discouraged because my monthly measurements showed I gained weight AND body fat. I had recently increased my strength and cardio workouts to 4-5 days a week for 1 1/2 to 2 hours each day. I had also been slowly cutting back on the amount of food I eat which in general is pretty healthy food as far as calories and fat content go. What I didn't realize until I got this app is how many sugars are in even artificial sweeteners, and with my sweet tooth, I was eating way more artificial sweetener than I realized or even cared about. Free calories, right? That was my thinking."

7930,7930,5,2011-06-06T02:52:22.000Z,Conewago,One of the best food apps I've seen - practical & educational,"Clear and to the point--I like that it concisely tells WHY the food I've just scanned has the grade that it does.  Then it helps me find a better choice and understand why it's a better choice.   Note: I think the developers made a good choice by not including the ingredients list, or the nutrition table.  They don't clutter up the interface, and I do have the package right there in my hand if I want to see what's in it."

I would love if you added something like the ‚Äúmy bathroom shelf‚Äù section in the ‚ÄúThink Dirty‚Äù app. If I could scan all my items and have helpful alternatives right at my disposal it would make shopping so much easier rather than typing them in during the moment, not having service, scanningn.mm.

Never used it and had to pay an additional year because I didn‚Äôt cancel it.  Just make sure you know what you are purchasing.  I remember installing it but do not remember ever agreeing to pay over 30 bucks a year!

9005,9005,5,2019-10-13T16:40:19.000Z,AwesomeAutumn32839,Keeping track and staying fit!,I love this app. It‚Äôs easy to track your daily eating habits. It also gives you a rating scale on food that claims to be healthy. I love that I can check on food I buy from Trader Joe‚Äôs that‚Äôs not so healthy like it claims. The fact that you can scan the UPC code with your phone is great. I can add foods as well.
9006,9006,3,2019-10-30T03:31:18.000Z,How refreshing,I want to upload new items but don‚Äôt use the mail app on iPhone,I like the app. I just want to upload more labels and barcodes to help the database. I don‚Äôt use the mail app apple provides because it‚Äôs clunky.
9007,9007,3,2019-09-04T00:55:29.000Z,Iknowstuff2,Is it really worth the cost ? NO,Personally the free version did enough I feel as though I wasted $89.00 on the paid version - sorry guys it‚Äôs a good app but not $89.00 worth of good  as it is not the complete app.

9010,9010,1,2018-04-17T16:42:16.000Z,Gumbygirl11,Don‚Äôt waste your money,I spent $19.99 for the gluten free option and all it did was tag things that are gluten free! I already know what‚Äôs gluten free! For $20 I can get that info for free and many other apps- a waste of money for stuff my FitBit does already! And gives me WAY more info for free! And when I requested a refund the company said- sorry- not our problem! Not cool!

9013,9013,3,2018-05-22T16:13:20.000Z,Elle Da vinci,"Have only been using it for a few minutes, so kind of early to ask for my feedback","One problem with my first impression: the options for purchase of a premium feature, like gluten-free and allergies, is shown as $2.99 per month automatically renewing. But if you sign up for 12 months at a time, it states that it reduces your price to $1.43, non-automatically renewing for one year. When you choose this option, the screen shows a total of $19.99 for you to approve the purchase.  But when I did $1.43 times 12 months, the total comes out to only $17.76. Not a huge difference, but still, not a great first impression of transparency, since it‚Äôs a lot quicker to just purchase for $19.99 than to do the math and see that it‚Äôs not equal."

9015,9015,1,2018-10-02T16:12:40.000Z,Mommy1977,Very disappointing!!!,"I started using this app but found it very confusing and not helpful. I added the gluten free option for $19.99, which in my opinion is crazy that you have to pay for it.  However when I figured out that it wasn‚Äôt helping me I asked for a refund, in which Apple wouldn‚Äôt grant. Very disappointing. Do not pay for the add one in the app."

I can‚Äôt be roped into more fitness stuff that has to do with paying out 40 bucks a year. UA offers other premiums, as well as every other AP under, but at this rate I‚Äôll be spending $200 a year just find best hikes, caloric intake/BURN, vitamins and minerals shy of daily goals, bike trails, heart rates, farts/hour and everything else. But you Health applications that came with the phone monitors my movements, mindfulness and many other things, several free apps monitor other things and some even give ME $$$ for every step or exercise."
9017,9017,5,2018-11-08T14:44:27.000Z,dftygtbni,So far very nice,Have only used this for several days. Was also trying out MyNetDiary too but this one seemed more intuitive so going with it. Finds food quickly and the bar code scanner is pretty slick. If it helps me reach my goal then mission accomplished.

For some reason, the auto scan quit working with the last update, but all is well on my iPad again after this latest update. No need to enter bar codes, the scanner works perfectly.  Thank you developers for this very useful app.  I recently started paying attention to ingredients as I began the Cinch! Diet.  Love the diet and love the app."

9023,9023,5,2011-04-09T10:37:17.000Z,Know when to hold em,Outstanding,"Found out about it from a friend and I cannot believe what manufacturers sneak into foods. This ap really tries to educate the consumer. The salt, sugars and preservatives are endangering our health in this country mainly because people are unaware of what is really in the food they are eating.

It's actually made shopping fun, it's like having a dietitian in your pocket! It helps you cut through the bs of advertising without having to read the whole label everytime. A vast database of foods and alternatives is impressive so far and scan results are compiled fast (depending on your connection)."
9026,9026,5,2011-04-10T18:24:04.000Z,Sandskrit,Fantastic!,I love this app! It's the most useful in providing alternatives that are healthier which has always been my biggest problem when deciding what to eat. I can't say enough about how good this app is! It's also easy to generate a grocery list of the items I'll want to get by adding them as things I like.

I immediately started scanning everything in my fridge and cupboard.  This app has great potential and the fact that the users help updated it adds a sense that it's accurate and reliable.
9036,9036,5,2011-02-15T18:19:58.000Z,.hfl,Fantastic app!,"I highly recommend this app. Already it has helped me eat better and I have also been surprised at some of the ratings of things I thought were healthy!

9044,9044,5,2011-02-06T17:02:30.000Z,Visionist,Impressive,"Works very well on my iPhone4. The camera usually locks focus on the product's bar code in a second or so, then delivers the results to you almost instantly. I emailed the company a question about a product's trans fat content, and they responded in about 20 minutes with a very helpful (even eye opening) answer. I'm impressed. I learned that some of what I've been eating daily is really quite good; others not so much :("

I think when it comes to purified tap water it's all pretty much the same and I'll drink water made by coca cola when the ice caps melt and water works rules apply. and then only.
9050,9050,1,2011-01-09T04:05:06.000Z,Jd135427,Scanner doesn't work,The scanner doesn't scan the bar codes. I've tried it in every lighting condition possible. When I enter the barcode manually the search button disappears. This is the worst app. Don't waste your time downloading it.

One used in embalming fluid!!! What?!! I was blown away! Also, it's VERY easy to add products (if you scan an item and it's not in the system). Once they've added it, they will send a message via your Fooducate Inbox to let you know it's been posted and what the results are. I've been called a ""food snob"" because I tend to eat healthier foods/brands. I find this app incredibly USEFUL and FUN!  ÓÄéÓÄé"

Several were not in the database. So I was asked to take a pic of front, nutrition facts and ingredients. An email comes up with the images and off they go. Couldn't be easier. Kind of fun. I will use in store next"

9122,9122,2,2011-04-08T02:32:50.000Z,Óå∂ConfusedÓå∂,Maybe all I know is wrong?,"This app doesn't make much sense to me. For example, it gives kraft macaroni and cheese a c+. Which happens to be the same score it gives organic earth's best stage one banana baby food. However, if you're in the mood for a better alternative to the original kraft mac n' cheese, you're in luck. The kraft mac n' cheese with  Shrek noodles is a B. This app gives you healthier alternatives to all other products as well. Did you know water is a better alternative than coke? Download this app and you'll be able to blow people's minds too! Great concept, but right now this is kinda useless...to me at least."

9182,9182,5,2011-04-09T20:02:10.000Z,SPitcher1313,Awesome!,Love having the alternate choices. This is my go to grocery store app!!

9186,9186,5,2011-04-11T18:45:07.000Z,Diesel9797,Great app,"Helps you review products very quickly, and easy to compare items your thinking of eating or buying."
9187,9187,4,2011-04-12T14:34:06.000Z,RRR2010,So far impressive,"The database is new but there is an option to send in new foods by taking a picture of the nutrition label. Some ratings seem a bit conservative and seem to rank healthy food low. As an example a Wasa cracker is rated as ""b"" but no explanation as to why."
9188,9188,5,2011-04-12T18:33:18.000Z,deanslist,Works well,I was surprised to find the numbers on some items. Especially products that have small labels and we think are innocuous.
9189,9189,5,2011-04-12T21:21:51.000Z,Apamendes,"I love it, great for weight watchers","Great, great"

9194,9194,4,2011-04-08T02:23:12.000Z,aky5d,Great app!,This gets addictive. I find I want to scan all of my food!  I'm only a little confused about the rating system. It rated chocolate covered raisins from Costco and Simply Orange juice the same b+ rating. Not quite sure how they are equal. User interface is easy and intuitive. They haven't had all of the items I've scanned in but it has helped me to choose a good alternative even if they don't have my items in their database
9195,9195,5,2011-04-08T02:48:56.000Z,Lori R.,Mom and teacher,The barcode scanner is amazing.  I just spent 20 minutes scanning everything I could find!  It also has a feature that explains all the additives that is really informative.  Love this app!

I definitely recommend this app."

9230,9230,5,2011-03-29T16:10:28.000Z,Mama Hen 03,Genius App!!!,Love this app! It's so helpful when shopping. Saves time and hassle. Makes healthy food choices easy and fun.

9232,9232,3,2011-03-29T23:34:45.000Z,PatrickX64,Annoying,On my iPad 2 you type in the barcode number which is pretty annoying. Other than that great
9233,9233,3,2011-03-30T00:23:30.000Z,ALHM,Connection required :(,Any chance this app could work without an Internet connection?  iPod touch relies on wifi only and most markets don't have wifi available. Otherwise this app is remarkable.
9234,9234,5,2011-03-30T00:43:34.000Z,Mamamax1313,Love this,Works like a charm!!! Love this!
9235,9235,2,2011-03-30T09:50:54.000Z,S logo,I used to love this app.,"I have an iPod touch 4 and when I first downloaded this, the barcode scanner worked great with the built in camera. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. After an update, the scanner seems to have been revoked. I won't be using this app anymore. I don't have the patience to type in the barcodes."
9236,9236,5,2011-03-30T21:18:12.000Z,Fltatndnt,This app is amazing!,"I love how you get the good, the bad, and the ugly truth with this app. I went through my entire pantry to view the nutritional information in any easy to understand format. After seeing all the crap that I ingest daily, I decided to take a closer look at the products that I eat. Thanks for such an awesome application!"
9237,9237,5,2011-03-31T00:00:48.000Z,RandomAndy1,Fantastic!,What a great app - alerts you to anything unhealthy that might be hiding in your food. I learned a lot about mystery ingredients and what they actually do for the food. Running this on an iPod touch at home and it's great. Not annoying to type in UPCs at all.
9238,9238,5,2011-03-31T07:48:54.000Z,Itsalwaysjohnny,Wow!,Best health app I've downloaded! Worked on almost all products in my kitchen and I love that it gives better alternatives for your food. Worth downloading!!!

9240,9240,4,2011-03-26T15:31:38.000Z,OddMom,"Good app, needs a couple tweaks",Please!! add a function to view a random product without shaking the phone! It's cute and everything but impractical.
9241,9241,5,2011-03-26T18:14:05.000Z,lisaraz,Best app ever for health.,I love this app. It makes me more aware of what I eat and gives suggestions if what I'm craving is not so good. It needs a search option but I read it's coming soon! Can't wait for this app to get even better!  You won't be disappointed if you get it.
9242,9242,3,2011-03-26T23:56:46.000Z,_aimee,What happened to scanning?,I try to scan a barcode and it will only let me type it in. What happened?
9243,9243,5,2011-03-27T18:22:00.000Z,Ds0228,Great,This app is very useful.. Easy to use at the grocery and very helpful.

9247,9247,5,2011-03-29T03:38:35.000Z,CAwinediva,Great Tool,Someone mentioned Fooducate at a Weight Watcher meeting.  The points application is perfect.  It makes it so easy to scan the foods and you can write the point value on the packages for future use.
9248,9248,5,2011-03-29T13:53:57.000Z,prettygirlmeka,Great app!!!,Highly recommend! I will be scanning everything from now on.

9250,9250,3,2011-03-23T01:07:38.000Z,YupG,Faulty manual entry,Manual barcode entry does not work.  It always says the product is not in the system.

9253,9253,4,2011-03-23T20:27:02.000Z,Pointdexter11,Great but could use more ( it's a growing app),An absolutely great app but needs more stuff Like having the capabilities to type in a product if it doesn't have a barcode on it and if really want to get deep u can tell people what ham or cookies does to the body
9254,9254,5,2011-03-23T22:17:36.000Z,Norman Brown,Love this app!,Just used it for the first time and loved it... Love the detail!! Keep up the good work :-)
9255,9255,4,2011-03-25T05:57:54.000Z,Bm2011,Cool app!,"Just installed & tested some pantry items, very cool. The scanner took me a few tries to get used to, but it's easy once you get the hang of it. At first glance, it looks like it could use some small enhancements like sorting & deleting options, but overall I think it will be very useful."
9256,9256,5,2011-03-26T04:15:04.000Z,Mrs. organized,Wow!,Very informational! You will be surprised what is in the food you eat! Thanks for a great app.
9257,9257,5,2011-03-26T04:19:58.000Z,Rating it an avg,Very impressed,I think this app really breaks it down! Just needs better alternatives on certain things but overall it's awesome!

9259,9259,4,2011-03-26T12:53:06.000Z,Southernlady5464,Love the app but have one issue,Great app but entering a manual barcode is a hassle especially if there is a space in the code. Please fix.
9260,9260,5,2011-03-16T18:31:44.000Z,SarahSdCA,Wow,"Great app, scanner works on seemingly everything! Love that it finds healthier alternatives!"
9261,9261,5,2011-03-16T21:33:30.000Z,TKinOK,My new FAVORITE app!,I love this app so far. I downloaded today and went through the grocery store scanning stuff I usually buy. I was also comparing the FoodPoints value to WeightWatchers PointsPlus and they are largely the same. I agree with previous reviewer who said a back button on the product listing screen would be helpful.
9262,9262,5,2011-03-17T03:17:35.000Z,SimpleA,Love it!,"This app is really useful, informative AND fun! I loved scanning things I already had in my home (overall not very good grades!) and seeing the things I should be getting instead. It's fun to make a game out of it and see if you can fill your shopping cart with all good grades."
9263,9263,5,2011-03-18T07:24:15.000Z,Shshaz,Wow!can't believe it's free,I would pay for this app it's that good! Tons of information not just on items you scan but other food facts too.
9264,9264,5,2011-03-18T23:31:06.000Z,Dragonslsayer,Awesome!,"I would love to see this app handle food allergies in the future too.  It would be amazing to warn for gluten, milk, nuts, etc."
9265,9265,5,2011-03-20T18:31:46.000Z,Baby Stinky,What's really in that?,This is a fantastic app! It's easy to use and provides good pieces of information. I would recommend this app to all that care about what food they and their children are eating.
9266,9266,5,2011-03-20T20:20:24.000Z,Amf0719,Great app!,"I love fooducate, it's like having an expert in my pocket helping me make the best decisions when it comes to food. Plus it's so fun to scan everything. Fooducate has already opened my eyes to a lot of unhealthy choices I was making without knowing it. I'll never shop without it again."

9271,9271,4,2011-03-14T15:35:42.000Z,anobanamanyan,I was impressed,it's a pretty cool app. needs to add more food though but overall it's a good app.
9272,9272,5,2011-03-14T20:31:36.000Z,Weranger,Love this app!,I have used this app every time I have gone to the grocery store since I got it. It is stuff I already knew but now I don't have to take the time to read the label. I just scan and this app reviews it for me. A great thing when shopping with kids. Plus I can access my scan history so I don't have to repeat scan. Love this app!
9273,9273,5,2011-03-14T21:51:00.000Z,aleedac,Best in class,This app is exactly as advertised. An easy to use interface with simple grading and a clear explanation if the grading PLUS healthy alternatives. What is NOT shown is how EXCELLENT and RESPONSIVE the developer is. This is a free app that I'd pay for!
9274,9274,5,2011-03-15T15:14:20.000Z,J Vagnone,Just a thought,"I love everything about this app....and not taking anything from it at all, but as a thought...it would be nice if when you look at the ""alternative foods"" selection that the app could show you places locally that sell that product. Like I said just a thought"
9275,9275,4,2011-03-15T15:24:15.000Z,KSuperNeato,Mostly good,"I love the idea of this app. It's very user friendly, it looks great, and it's helpful... most of the time. My big complaint is that the ""alternatives"" aren't always in the same realm of food that the search was. Examples: I was told that beans are a better choice than turkey bacon and that I should opt for an apple instead of snapea crisps (a chip-type snack)."
9276,9276,5,2011-03-16T00:23:23.000Z,scalumni,Great App!,I love this app. I can't believe it was free. This is one of the few apps that I use every day.
9277,9277,3,2011-03-16T04:25:40.000Z,Dlenore,Ok but needs work,"There are a lot of things I like about this app, and a lot I don't like."
9278,9278,5,2011-03-16T13:41:29.000Z,johnrobert,Amazing,Most useful app EVER!
9279,9279,5,2011-03-16T16:03:46.000Z,jjcsmom,Don't go shopping without it,"I love this app because it grades food items and points out hidden sugars, additives, fats, and other things that I don't know how to look for on my own.  I used it at three different stores on a number of items and was shocked to see the real content of food that was advertised as natural, organic, and a ""great source"" for this and that.  It was very disheartening to see how often the food industry lie to us.  This is an important app.  I'll never go grocery shopping without it again."
9280,9280,5,2011-03-08T10:18:26.000Z,JJMK Reed,LOVE THIS APP!,You have to try it out yourself to see how great it is... Words don't suffice!!!
9281,9281,5,2011-03-08T17:56:32.000Z,Jessbboll,Great,Awesome! No reason to eat the wrong foods!

9285,9285,5,2011-03-10T02:30:45.000Z,Jaok,So cool,This app is the jam!! Couldn't stop scanning everything in my kitchen

9287,9287,3,2011-03-12T04:18:19.000Z,vbuzzsaw,Not good for lo-carbers,"It's a great app in concept and it worked well scanning in many items, but not ideal if you don't agree fundamentally with their definition of what is healthy. For low carbers we don't buy into saturated fats being bad for us, like the warnings I get scanning in my full-fat stoneyfield yogurt.  Or the thumbs up it gives to cheerios..."
9288,9288,5,2011-03-14T00:58:02.000Z,elark,So informative,Love this app! My 6 year old daughter has been having fun scanning everything in the house...will be interesting to see if it affects her food choices!

9291,9291,4,2011-02-26T18:07:32.000Z,Soulncountry,Great even just for the curious,Like how it explains what maltodextrin and other things are.  I've sent in a label from a  trader joe's product from my iPhone 4 just now and that was pretty easy.
9292,9292,4,2011-03-01T02:22:33.000Z,Nivsam,Great app,"It's a great app but there are still quite a few food items that are missing info. However, i think as the # of users for this app increases the food item info will grow. I would recommend it. Love that it gives alternate healthier options to chose or compare"

9295,9295,4,2011-03-04T03:23:11.000Z,Cmgveggie,"Cool,but needs work","Works pretty well,but needs some work. Doesn't always offer alternatives that make sense. I scanned my boyfriends Ring Dings & it gave apples as an alternative. Granted an apple is a better choice, but showing a similar product would obviously make more sense."

9308,9308,4,2011-02-16T02:48:19.000Z,Marksniles,Awesome,Awesome app.  The only thing is that the scanner does not work.  It will not scan anything.
9309,9309,4,2011-02-19T18:50:21.000Z,atsears,needs a little tweaking but otherwise a great app,I would like this app better if it had a function to only recommend better choices that are available at the same store as the item I have scanned.
9310,9310,5,2010-12-12T13:59:21.000Z,digitalleighla,The future!,It's nice to see an app that actually makes the world a better place. Keep adding foods (including Trader Joes). Thus app rocks!
9311,9311,3,2010-12-27T20:48:39.000Z,Mrs. Yellow Bean,User input would help,The database could expand faster if you allow user input of nutritional information as per the packaging.

9313,9313,4,2011-01-12T03:58:07.000Z,Runnergirl14,I love it!,This is a great app that teaches you about ingredients and even some ingredients that are on the FDA watch list!  Good to know!  A few products were not available yet but it gives you the opportunity to take photos of the labels so that they can be entered into their data base.  Love it!
9314,9314,4,2011-01-13T04:35:35.000Z,D2theL,"Great app, shop smarter!","Scanning different brands of food, I learned alot about their ingredients. Shop a little bit smarter, find better alternatives. I like this App!"
9315,9315,4,2011-01-30T12:39:16.000Z,Matt.Perkins,Needs Search Option,To be a complete app it needs the ability to search for a product by name. Like if I wanted to search for a certain brand of cereal. I shouldnt have to go to the store and type in or scan the barcode. I should be allowed to type in the product name. Add search by name option for 5 stars.
9316,9316,4,2011-02-05T12:37:09.000Z,Intrepidus2,Great Idea,"This is a great app for consciously informed people.  Although not perfect, it is a great starting point.  I would like to see more of the ingredients listed including the additives and preservatives.  Are the products that I scan that aren't in your database being added?  There should be a way to scan products into memory to look up later when I have access to the Internet."
9317,9317,5,2011-02-06T12:51:48.000Z,Bella8127,Awesome,Love it!!!
9318,9318,2,2011-02-23T15:10:13.000Z,Tabbytrap,"Concept good, needs work","I really wish there was an option to search for products without the bar code scanner, this limits the utility of the app to only products I've bought or when I am at the store. My second major gripe is that the alternatives are not comparable to the search item. If I searched for a fruit juice, don't show me water. If I searched for shortening, nonstick cooking spray isn't going to serve the same function. I also cannot tell for sure, but it seems like products may get dinged on their rating for having high fat, even if it's healthy fats. The points amounts for dieters are nice but I hope that doesn't factor into the ratings. Foods can be healthy and be high in fat, it's just how you pair them with other foods. Rather than having the same standard for everything, the ratings need to be category relevant."
9319,9319,2,2011-02-28T00:25:58.000Z,Mikishti,Meh...,The concept is good. But my itouch 4G won't scan the barcodes 4 outta 5 times.

9327,9327,2,2017-01-11T14:34:19.000Z,Phillyford06,Too costly for limited benefits!! Research before purchasing.,"Not worth the money as there are cheaper apps with more food inventory and more realistic recipes. These seem to unrealistic to normal ingredients and easy to fix for entire family. I thought by paying 39.99 I would have had a lot more benefits than the cheaper apps but hasn't. Now I am out of the $40 so I'll just try to get what little benefit it us to offer   Before making this purchase please do your research on apps that your specifically want to control in your diet. You can buy multiple apps cheaper to get more benefits, in my opinion at least. I'm stuck with app now that google can't offer any refund and support doesn't offer any help on this app other than we will pass my displeasure with the app on."

9336,9336,4,2016-03-24T13:02:34.000Z,DOCRADLEY58,Excellent app,Very good for tracking and explaining food choices. Bar code scanner very helpful. I wish it was more accommodating on supplements since as an athlete I end up needing some of these to achieve calorie goals and to support workouts over an hour. For some reason it is also prone to double counting sleep and exercise data requiring me to go in and delete the duplicates.
9337,9337,1,2016-06-07T09:22:59.000Z,NagjosepyShwood,Not worth it,"I don't think the app works very well and it's a pain in the butt to cancel your subscription. If you want to try this app out, don't do it because they do NOT make it easy to cancel. Then you're stuck being charged $2.99 a month for an app you're not using. Even if you delete the app they'll keep charging you. $2.99 isn't a lot of money but residually it adds up and it's a waste."
9338,9338,5,2016-08-01T05:54:33.000Z,TigerRampage,Woke me up!,"Great experience with this app so far. Unlike other diet/health apps, this one tells you the cold, hard truth about what you're consuming and how healthy your current diet really is. It does this through a color-coded grading scale of A to D. In addition, it has everything you would expect and more out of a diet app, including a barcode scanner, list of ingredients for every product, a daily calorie/food log, etc. It has a community forum where users can post and talk, it allows users to contribute by adding images to products that are missing them, and it suggests alternatives to all of those products. There is much incentive through this app for you to get off your lazy a** and fix your health."
9339,9339,5,2016-09-15T07:22:27.000Z,Nehede3,Easy peasy!,I was hesitant to use this app thinking it would be cumbersome but for most things I'm able to take picture of the bar code and bam! All the information is there. I've always been told to keep a food diary but never followed through until now.

9344,9344,3,2015-02-16T21:47:32.000Z,IronJohn54,"Love the app, but..........","There are a lot of things to love about this app. The fact that one can scan the bar code and see the product information is a huge time saver. I also like the fact that foods are graded with alternatives given. However, some of the products are not available where I live (i.e. we are no where near a Trader Joe's). I am taking away two stars for the following reasons. First, if one misses adding a meal to the Health Tracker, the only way to do this is to move the arrow to yesterday and hope that the product you want is in the Recent, My Meals or a third tab. If not, you cannot go to My Lists since the Health Tracker will go back to Today. Major inconvenience if you forget a snack or a meal side dish. Second, the limit for serving sizes is three and only increments in .5 units. Would prefer additional flexibility like adding Weight to the Health Tracker or have the past date feature here. Third, if my wife makes bean soup with ham, finding the Nutrition information would be difficult. Making a sandwich with chicken, a little mayo and tomato on whole wheat bread requires four different product searches. Can a meal be created outside of the Health Tracker? I haven't seen it yet."
9345,9345,3,2015-02-22T21:01:25.000Z,Maddieesc,Loved it.. But.. Now...,"I loved this app! It's informative, informational, and has a great, helpful, friendly community. But one day, it suddenly logged me out. No big deal. Until- I tired to log back in and it said my password was wrong, so I checked my email and password, did it again. It still said incorrect. So then I clicked 'forgot password' and tried to send myself a new password, but it said the email was wrong. Which I know isn't true, I used the same email because I had to change my username that WAS my email username. Please fix this, or help me, because idk what to do now."

Choosing from $1.99 to $14.99 plans that renew depending on which plan you choose. Dislike. Greed prevails apparently, which is why they are in business in the first place."

9352,9352,5,2014-02-12T23:55:34.000Z,Usernameisalwaystaken,If I could rate higher I would,This app is so great! It's very eye opening. If you are trying to lose weight it's awesome because you can track everything. It gives you points based on your goals your weight and your height not just a general system. If a product isn't on their app you take a picture and send it to their team and they will search all of the info and add it. It's amazing how many foods are GMO! I knew it was a problem but not until now did I know just how huge it was. My 8yr old scans food at the store and it's fun for her to choose healthy safe options.

9355,9355,5,2014-04-17T14:41:00.000Z,Missmodernist,MY FAVORITE APP!!!!!,"I've been using this app for a long time.  It's great because it makes you aware of your choices in food.  It tells you about all the good and bad ingredients just by scanning the bar code.  If the food item itself gets a low grade, it will give you healthier options! I use this app all the time.  I just don't shop for myself, I shop for my 2 year old as well so I'm constantly looking for healthy options for him.  My husband also loves this app.  He hates having to put in the effort of reading ingredients and researching all the weird chemicals and additives. Just scan it and it's all there for you!!! Simple as pie! Healthy pie that is!  :)"

It's a pain in the butt that I have to log in when I'm trying to get in and out of the grocery store and wanna look something up real quick.  It's not like I have my Fooducate username and password memorized.  Otherwise, very good."

I also love that if the bar code doesn't register to the food, you can send info and pics of the item and they add it. So far everything I have sent has been added very quickly. I also like that you can add your own foods by putting in the nutrition information yourself. I would highly recommended this app."
9366,9366,3,2013-08-27T02:11:50.000Z,Showcorvettelove,Old Version Is Better,"Call me crazy, but I miss the older version of Fooducate. The second you opened the app, it took you to the scanner. The second you were done scanning a food item, you could head back to the scanner immediately. Why they got rid of that great usability is beyond me!"
9367,9367,4,2013-09-03T14:25:57.000Z,Whitecarsx3,Ok app with issues,If you follow the ratings chances are you will eat almost nothing but raw vegetables. There seems to be something wrong with everything.
9368,9368,4,2013-12-19T22:05:37.000Z,@hunter_green,Great app,An iOS 7 makeover ought to do the trick.

Just scan the bar code and glance at the letter grade or read why it gets that grade so you can make educational decisions without the apps help
9373,9373,5,2013-02-12T10:10:07.000Z,Cluterr,Great!!,It's a no brainer when your shopping. Just scan the bar code and you instantly know if it is a good for you food or not so great food.

9375,9375,5,2013-03-12T09:30:24.000Z,DJ Maxx Saint,Poison Food!,You'll be surprised how PETRO makes its way into food products. I'm growing my own food from now on. Just scan the bar code with this app and you'll see the truth in food labeling.
9376,9376,3,2013-03-28T01:11:45.000Z,DonniDelRey,Perfect food app but...,The scanning tool doesn't focus on the bar code and doesn't scan. I have to close the app then open the scan tool to work. Make a button to tap to focus and take picture! Please fix!
9377,9377,5,2013-04-02T23:38:18.000Z,Blackcat_409,Love it!!!,"The is sooooo easy to keep up with. I have try other, but this is the first that let me scan in the bar code and found all the info for me!!! I love this app."
9378,9378,5,2013-04-24T12:41:54.000Z,07Blackdog,Great App!,Thanks to Natural News for promoting this app.We need a Prop. 37 in each of the 50 states.No GMO's.
9379,9379,4,2013-05-06T23:02:30.000Z,Bekahsa,Scanning a product,"The reason why I give a 4 star is because the app does not scan that well the products, it takes a long time to capture the bar code"
9380,9380,5,2012-10-16T16:09:17.000Z,n.greuel,Educational!,I have found myself sitting on the floor in the kitchen scanning whatever food I can find with a bar code. You will surprise yourself with this app!
9381,9381,5,2012-10-17T03:08:13.000Z,Gabikausa,Mrs,"I love this ap.It makes shopping easier than ever,no more hidden ingredients.I highly recommend it to everyone!"

9383,9383,5,2012-10-22T13:10:18.000Z,moovalerie,Very useful app,Fooducate does just that.  I can use it at the grocery store to make educated buying decisions about packaged food by scanning the bar code.  Products are given a letter grade based on their ingredients and nutrition facts.  You can add a product to the app's library by sending a photo of it.  I especially love the option of adding GMO alerts since that's not information most companies want you to think about!
9384,9384,2,2012-10-27T11:33:56.000Z,Origamigrl,Fooducate bar code scan issues,"Great site, but cannot get scan or data entry for bar codes to work properly - doesn't recognize all characters typed and only acknowledged one of 5 bar codes scanned.  This part of ap is not reliable -anyone else having this issue?"
9385,9385,5,2012-11-16T21:34:17.000Z,Woodhink,Best Food App,"GOOD: Look up food by name, look up food by bar code, easy to understand letter grade system"
9386,9386,4,2012-12-10T18:51:01.000Z,xnumberoneson,Easy way to find healthy foods.,"The fooducate app makes it easy to compare different brands of the same product. Occasionally their grades are a but harsh (dark chocolate gets low marks even though its health benefits are known), but overall it has made md a better shopper."
9387,9387,4,2012-12-19T20:28:21.000Z,BabeCaribe,Just Good,"When this app works, it's great. I'd give it five stars except for two issues. The first is that it is hard to get the scanner to work  on rounded containers like soup cans etc. The second is that it doesn't always work in the grocery store. If your store doesn't get wifi or has a poor connection, you won't get any results. Sometimes the bright lights in the store reflect on the bar code and the app can't get a read on it. You have move to a shadowed area for it to work. Other than that, I recommend this app. You just have to get used to working around these quirks."
9388,9388,4,2013-01-09T22:33:29.000Z,8singme2sleep,Great Tool,"I love this app. I would give it a 5 star rating but I think there are some areas to improve. Would love more information about organic products. And maybe explain if a product rates bad but is still good for you, for example dark chocolate. It rates bad because you are limited to 2 squares a day, not the whole bar."
9389,9389,5,2013-01-27T11:14:52.000Z,Nutwal,MD,I highly recommend this app as a tool to assess the quality of food ingested.
9390,9390,4,2012-03-23T10:50:33.000Z,Nanahass,Review,"I have just started using it and so far I am enjoying in. I like the scan code s I can determine just how many calories, sodium ,carbs in items"
9391,9391,5,2012-04-30T00:27:21.000Z,FigToker,One of the best Apps of all,Really helpfull app.If you are one of those people who take care of your body this is a must be.

9393,9393,5,2012-06-13T23:56:13.000Z,LLfromPA,Functional & Fun!!,This is a great app for anyone who wants to improve their eating habits. Love that I can scan the bar code & get all the info I could ever want. The alternative foods are a bonus.
9394,9394,5,2012-07-11T03:31:21.000Z,EricHopeSF,EXCELLENT app. Absolutely ESSENTIAL...,"SO informative & helpful... And so easy to use! Just scan the bar code of the product you're curious about, and prepare to be educated (about IT, and other products LIKE it)! If it's not in their database already, then submit it! Couldn't be easier. This app is absolutely INDISPENSABLE!"
9395,9395,4,2012-07-16T11:34:21.000Z,mvw1964,Don't shop without it!,Helps me make the best possible decision when options are available. I love it! Bar code scanner is a bit temperamental at times. GREAT app!
9396,9396,4,2012-08-08T19:06:09.000Z,Durnt,Very Useful,I've been using this nonstop since I downloaded it. The scan is way better than other barcode scan apps I have. It's quick and recognizes even when the code is slightly askew. It really has educated me in nutrition as some products I preciously thought were not too bad are pretty bad. I'm giving this 4 stars bc. the add add'l info function crashes sometimes. Overall very useful app.
9397,9397,5,2012-08-21T12:44:54.000Z,Tanzismom,The best app for dieters,I absolutely love this app. It is easy to use and has a huge data base. I have shared it with all my weight watcher friends. We love the fact that foods have been translated to points.  The bar code scanner is great. I shop at Trader Joe's and most products can be scanned. Love. Love. Love!!
9398,9398,4,2012-09-20T23:22:30.000Z,Drewjames,v2.60,Much needed navigation update.

9401,9401,5,2011-10-28T13:08:42.000Z,Slschia,Great app!,Easy to use. The app immediately recognizes most grocery items after quickly scanning the bar code and instantly give an A-F grade and the few biggest factors in the grading are listed prominently. I use it in the grocery store frequently especially for cereal amd snacks

9404,9404,5,2012-01-07T14:56:18.000Z,M Family,A Weight Watchers dream come true!,I'm a lifetime Weight Watcher member with iPhone access to their eTools and it isn't as good as this app! The bar code scanner is a dream come true. I love the points info. It is so much easier to scan than to key all info into my WW points calculator app. Plus it gives me alternatives if I don't like the points value I receive. I can make a better choice right at the moment. Great for grocery shopping! Thanks for the GREAT APP! Love it!!

9407,9407,3,2012-02-13T18:34:10.000Z,michael san gaspar,Best one,Ok.  One of my best app in my phone.   Although i wish it will scan and tell me info and alternative for food that has no bar code.  Like restaurant food.  It does not have to be concise but at least a general idea of food info.
9408,9408,5,2012-03-03T17:55:03.000Z,lenzierickson,love it,NEW FAVORITE APP! LOVE IT

I especially love the compare feature to help make a quick choice at the store. I can think of a few things that would make this app even better, like... A choice to filter your search according to ingredients so"

9413,9413,5,2011-07-15T02:11:19.000Z,CCBgood,Simply Incredidle,"This app is amazing. I have been trying to shop healthier for my family. This app let's me know if I have made good food choices. Simply scan the bar code, & it provides a simple to understand product rating. Products are rated A-D, with A being excellent and D being poor.  The best part is that it provides 5 healthier alternative food choices to the scanned product. I love this app."

9416,9416,4,2011-09-12T18:34:23.000Z,MrzzMel,Missing 1 thing,I absolutely Like this app a lot. The only thing that makes me just shy if loving it is that I can't log the food I look up. Which means that I have to log my food in another app :(.
9417,9417,5,2011-09-21T16:42:19.000Z,JHatem,Awesome,"I use daily. Easy and helps to steer my family toward healthy products. Of course, if your food has a bar code, step one is to eat more foods without one."
9418,9418,5,2011-10-02T15:21:56.000Z,littleshay,I really use this app a lot!,"If you're tempted to think that bar code scanning technology is kitsch or a novelty like QR codes, normally I would agree, but this app takes that technology and makes it applicable--nay--almost necessary! I use Fooducate all the time and people who don't have iPhones, ask me to scan things for them! This app could easily become a way of life. Bravo!"

9420,9420,5,2011-04-07T16:26:48.000Z,ScottySauce,LOVING THIS APP AND NOW WITH THE NEW UPDATE SCANNING IS BETTER AND IPOD SUPPORTED!,"Fooducate inspires ‚Äúwow that is cool‚Äù to me, scanning bar tags near instantly is pretty sweet, then pulling up a good amount of data on the product, even cooler. Eating well from pre-packaged food is a near impossibility anymore. Every single item in the store has a catch. Hidden sodium content, extra carbs, lack of protein, you name it. Fooducate helps with the decision whether to pick something up or put it down for good, an in-store, hand-held guilt trip. Point your iPhone or iPod with camera at a bar code and wait the 3 seconds for it to give you a grade on the healthiness of any product at your grocery store. It is super simple and quick as hell finding the info on your item. It includes a large amount of information on each product also, not just providing the grade, it tells you why it gives that grade, what the problem with the product is (30% of your daily salt in 1 serving, 1/2, of 1 can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli), alternative products to what you‚Äôve scanned that are better options,  and details about the red flags affecting the grade. It is pretty depressing to know your lunch is 60% of your entire daily allotment of salt, knowing you‚Äôre killing yourself with ravioli is pretty damned depressing."
9421,9421,5,2011-05-25T10:59:00.000Z,Em1678,So helpful!,"I love this app so much! I love how u can scan the bar code of products u have. And I love how it gives products a grade on if its healthy or not. This app has helped me eat better, and its just plain fun!! And this is to all of u guys who think the scanner doesnt work- IT DOES! ive tried it before and it worked! Just put the camera in front of the barcode for like 10 or more seconds. Then it will work."
9422,9422,5,2011-06-09T01:26:14.000Z,Polish Marigold,Fooducate,"Upon hearing that my boyfriend downloaded this app, I admit that I was skeptical. It's not hard to identify unhealthy foods; if it is packaged or wrapped it's cause for concern! I downloaded it today at the grocery store to find the safest butter and have used it at least 50 times so far. It is BRILLIANTLY informative as far as specific health concerns ranging from artificial colors to preservatives to sulfites to fiber content...easy to use, amazing app. If an item is not on their database, you can take a pic and send it to them, so they can add it. Well done!"
9423,9423,5,2011-06-12T17:03:08.000Z,Icare59,A must have app,You can scan the food in your house and see how good or bad you select the food you eat.But more fun to take shopping so you can choose healthier food next time.Great app.
9424,9424,4,2014-02-09T18:25:38.000Z,Leenieva,Favorites please!,"Perfect app, just wish there was a way to have a favorites list!"
