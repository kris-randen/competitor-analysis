0,0,5,2018-10-27T14:34:22.000Z,beefkabob11,The app fits what I am looking for!,"I‚Äôm lovin‚Äô this app so far, just into it for a week.  I was tracking most of my diet info in a spreadsheet prior  and I really like the ease and availability of the food selections and their specs along with their crisp, easy to read presentation, nice Job! I switch between the web app while at my computer and I really like the graphs to see where I‚Äôm at. Just started to look through what‚Äôs offered in premium and I would definitely pay for these features as I finely tune my usage and become proficient with it, but honestly I think your sweet spot right now is between $2.99 and $3.99 per month.  Bigger and more graphs on the mobile and web app would be great!  Until people like myself get enough time to use and appreciate the app and assess its value, your higher price is a psychological hurdle, at least for me.  I‚Äôve learned to trust my gut in app purchases and the fact that I did not jump in immediately confirms that.  I‚Äôll certainly have more feedback as I get into it further. Overall, I think you guys are on the right track with a really nice app and I‚Äôm anxious to see what‚Äôs coming next!"
1,1,5,2019-06-21T22:30:21.000Z,Tumblr4dayyyyyyyys,Great app & preferred over myfitness pal,"I enjoy the layout & design of the app. I love that it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much or shame me when I don‚Äôt track calories or log a workout(?) That was an issue I found with myfitnesspal. The online forums also seem a bit more active and encouraging on this app. The app design is simple & to the point. Nutritional facts are seemingly on point. Not a hard app to figure out at all & they have a broad range of food options and choices. I‚Äôve only found it hard to find nutritional info for obscure Asian snacks. In that case, I try to track for something comparable and factor in calories from the packaging to match my food diary. I love the weigh-in function and the data charts available. You are also not inundated by ads and not at risk of accidentally pressing on an ad and opening a new webpage so that‚Äôs a big win for me! Great app, I would highly recommend to anyone who just wants to keep an easy and accurate food diary. Whatever your fitness or weight loss goals, this is a great app in general to aid those goals."
2,2,4,2018-01-22T17:02:57.000Z,angeliaanderson,Love it,"I love using fatsecret. The diary and logs and support from other users is excellent and so helpful in my weightless journey. Love the fact that you can set your own macros and calories or have it calculated for you. Tracking is mostly easy and the library of foods is extensive. That being said I noticed sometimes, not all the time, they are a little off. For example my protein I use has 3 grams sugar and when I scan the barcode the app says 0 sugar. So for people who are needing to be exact on their counts you need to just double check that they have it correctly in the system. Also, when you get notifications that someone has responded to your diary log you have to go through some steps to get to the exact message. I wish the notification center would take you directly to the message for easy reply or viewing. Only other complaint is that you have to use the online version to change your profile picture and get access to certain features but that isn't a deal breaker for me. The app does everything you need it to.  Other than that I love this app and will continue using it."
3,3,5,2018-02-25T15:29:42.000Z,Kris1015zzzxz,Comprehensive weight loss app that's easy to use!,"This is the best weight loss app ever. I have used a few others but they do not compare. You can customize what you want to track, whether carbs, protein, fat etc. It also gives you the full nutritional breakdown of your meals, including salt and cholesterol percentages which is awesome. The recipes are fantastic and you can even participate in community conversations with fellow app users for those that want support. Adding food/recognizing label codes are super easy to do. My 5 stars are more like 4.5 stars. I took off half a star because a few times the barcode reader can be a bit off when scanning items. exp...The label may say 10 carbs or calories etc, but what is registered may be a higher or lower number. So at the end of the day your total count may be off by a few digits. Not sure if it is the fault of the app or the barcode. Either way, it is a mild nuisance that doesn't occur often enough to be problematic. With that being said, the app is awesome and I 100% recommend it."
4,4,5,2020-03-17T16:19:21.000Z,wkrasl,Better than expected,"Having type 2 diabetes, I used to use the ‚ÄúDiabetes In Check‚Äù app, which included specific features for diabetics. Even then, when entering some new food item I always went to the Fat Secret web site to look up nutrition information."
5,5,3,2019-05-14T19:58:33.000Z,GNewYork,App Inaccuracies,"The app has things like general common vegetables: kale, tomatoes, zucchini, etc where your calorie and carb count is definitely a lot different than that of other apps. This makes it difficult to track the carbs and protein in our meal. It would be great for general items like that if you added the ability to change the size of the general tomato by ounce and adjust calories proportionally.. Instead, we are tied to a medium tomato with XYZ calories... It would be best to take the general calorie averages of all brands of tomatoes and then add them in that way.."
6,6,3,2018-10-18T20:10:48.000Z,Maria Koppel,"Good, but...","I have been using the app for two weeks now, primarily the diet diary function. I appreciate the wide variety of options when I search for a particular food. However, the app freezes while I'm searching and adding foods during almost every meal entry. Any items that I have ""saved"" are lost. I have to fully close the app, re-open, and re-enter lost items for that meal. It's frustrating. Also, I took off a star of the horrible, tacky name ""FatSecret"". What kind of name is that? Is the app calling users fat? Is the app a secret cure to fatness? It sounds unprofessional."
7,7,1,2019-07-31T23:15:10.000Z,lipidolite,Fatphobic as it gets!,"When starting out with this app, it‚Äôll prompt you your goals (weight gain or loss & how much you‚Äôd like to gain or lose) & physical attributes (height, current weight, activity levels, etc.). Being extremely underweight like I am, I was excited to see a health app offer weight gain as an option. However, EVERYTHING on the app stays set to weight loss despite what you put in as your goal. It‚Äôll send you notifications like ‚ÄúYou only need 400 calories to power yourself through!‚Äù as if you‚Äôre trying to barely survive. The actual calorie counter has a daily meter for how much you‚Äôve consumed of your daily goal. It fills up green, then when it‚Äôs full it turns red. Consuming enough or extra calories is a GOOD thing when you‚Äôre trying to gain weight, but this meter depicts the opposite. It even goes as far as to mess with your public profile & state that you‚Äôre there for weight loss despite the goal weight clearly being a higher number than the starting weight. I don‚Äôt see the purpose of offering ‚Äúweight gain‚Äù as an option when the entire app‚Äôs layout is permanently fixed on a weight loss routine. It‚Äôs extremely discouraging & fatphobic."
8,8,1,2018-12-27T03:35:47.000Z,Spookysabrina,Can‚Äôt get past the name ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,"It‚Äôs a pretty good app in all, I would like an option not to add ALL nutritional info, just calories (as seen on my fitness pal) because it provides a faster and easier option for many users, but the biggest block for me is that name... I previously used my fitness pal and had no problems keeping it on my home screen for everyone to see and I needed it there because I used it often and wanted quick and easy access to it, but having an app with ‚Äúfat‚Äù in the name on my home screen is embarrassing in all honesty. It was my biggest issue when I was looking into the app and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll keep it at this point. I wish the developers would see common sense and rename the app to a more positive, normal name that focuses on more than just fat. I mean, think about what that does to the user. Each time they open the app they feel like they‚Äôre reaching toward a goal, but never reaching it. In other words, it makes me feel like I‚Äôm fat when I know I‚Äôm not. It discourages me and is off-putting, but more than anything it‚Äôs just frustrating that someone would make such a great app and name it something so humiliating."
9,9,4,2018-03-12T14:51:48.000Z,pcasciola,Great app for tracking dietary goals,"Whether you are looking to monitor calorie intake, or carb/fat/protein, this is a great app. I‚Äôve used it several times over the past 5-6 years, this time to track carbs. Also charts weight over time so you can track your progress. You can enter you foods by using the phone camera to scan the barcode, and most things I scan are in their database."
10,10,5,2018-04-23T22:59:26.000Z,petah_t,Most comprehensive app for tracking macroe,"I‚Äôve tested 4-5 different apps to track my food and nutrient intake, including ones that cost money. FatSecret is the only one without annoying ads and is all business."
11,11,5,2018-07-24T22:34:39.000Z,LadybugCPA,This APP is WONDERFUL‚ù£Ô∏è,"FatSecret has not only enabled me to track my calories, fat, carbs, weight, etc., it has given me deep insight as to which foods are more nutritional than others. I am 73 and wanted to slowly lose 40 lbs. I log every bite I eat (no matter how small) + weight + exercise into this APP every day. My RDI is set for 1,400 calories per day, and this APP has enabled me to identify yummy foods that are high protein, low fat, low carbs, low sugar. With the adjustments I've made, I somehow manage to thrive on an avg of 1,200 cal or less/day, enjoy my fav foods, and I have yet to crave anything or be hungry."
12,12,5,2018-08-09T13:13:26.000Z,Hrrascal1,Love the new iPad version,"It makes it easy to keep track of weight and food.  I can easily share the meals across to my husband who is trying to loose weight too, but I did have to search hard for that ability. This new version makes it easier to keep unusual exercises/activities so they don‚Äôt have to be entered from scratch each time.  Kudos for that.  It‚Äôs also easier to move back to yesterday and add what you had for dinner if you didn‚Äôt the night before.  The sharing of info with HEALTH on the apple platforms is helpful since there is no blood pressure monitoring in your app.  Thanks for the hard work on the app, I used to prefer the desktop (and that should be updated) but with the new version the only reason I use the desktop is to share meals with hubby."
13,13,4,2018-08-29T22:23:12.000Z,SituSharon,Finally taking some pounds off with a little help from my friend,"I gained weight as I aged, went through menopause, had health issues and medication that causes weight gain. It was a loosing battle. After hearing so many people tell me I don‚Äôt eat enough and that is because I am NEVER Hungary I started using the app to see exactly how much I was eating.  Well my healthy choices I have always made totaled less then 600 calories a day!  So now I am sure to eat three meals and two snacks  I am able to get to a little less then 1000 calories per day most days. I am eating more protein and less carbs. Even being GF my carbs were too high. So I make better fruit and veggie chooses as well. That said I have lost 17 lbs in less then 2 months. Exactly 7 weeks.  It is coming off slow and steady and I am so much happier. I can start to look in a mirror and look at my reflection without disgust.  Love this app."
14,14,5,2019-01-26T17:45:55.000Z,Comparisonguy,Overall very good,"The layout is, for the most part, better than for MyFitnessPal. Some key things I‚Äôve noticed is that the green layout and the way the calorie numbers are presented make me less upset when I‚Äôve gone slightly over my calorie goals. My fitness pal makes me want to jump off the roof whenever I see that red negative bar at the top right haha. This is HUGE, because it makes tracking feel much less stressful and the overall vibe is much better this way."
15,15,5,2019-04-13T13:53:08.000Z,No Fat Boy Here,I was fat and it was no secret,"Finally got tired of tight fitting clothes and having a closet full of stuff I had fatted out of so downloaded FatSecret and started tracking everything I put into my mouth.  I wanted to lose 40 lbs in 4 months, and I am on track having lost 30lbs in 3 months."
16,16,5,2020-07-18T20:37:53.000Z,doyouseethatdog,This Is A Good App,"I‚Äôm a Muay Thai fighter/coach, and marathon/ultra marathon runner, and I downloaded this app because I was switching to a high fat, low carb diet to train for my next ultra marathon, and I just need to be a little more efficient at using fat for fuel. This app has been extremely helpful in tracking my caloric intake as well as allowing me to keep track of my macro nutrient intake. There are a ton of foods already in the app, and if you can‚Äôt find exactly what you‚Äôre looking for, it allows you to enter the nutritional information for the food and save it. You can also enter any exercise and how many hours you sleep any given night to show how many calories you‚Äôre burning in a day, and what your caloric intake should be depending on your goals (losing, maintaining, or gaining weight). I highly recommend this app."
17,17,4,2020-05-20T10:17:42.000Z,KaraMaraBara,Easy to use; would like to see micronutrient information,"I haven‚Äôt used a lot of other food tracking apps, but I‚Äôve really enjoyed how easy it is to use FatSecret (e.g. they list your most recently and more frequently eaten foods so you can quickly add them to your food diary). They are also responsive via email, which is really nice. Three things I really want to see: (1) a tally of all the vitamins and minerals we‚Äôve had for the day, (2) the ability to drop a whole list of food into a recipe (like some other websites) instead of having to add ingredients one by one, and (3) the ability to add ingredients to a recipe without having to create a recipe (e.g. without always having to add steps, a description, etc. since I often make the same recipe, but tweak it & also since many of us prepare our meals instead of buying pre-packaged meals)"
18,18,5,2019-08-15T23:33:20.000Z,All nicknames were taken!,This app really works,I used the fat secret website years ago to lose weight but the app is much better now than the website I remember. I used weight watchers prior to switching back to fat secret. I like the nutritional information fat secret provides and their database is reasonably complete with every type of food. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of artificial points and always looked up the calorie content of the foods I ate on weight watchers.
19,19,5,2020-03-16T13:37:12.000Z,Artwaste,Great except....,"I really enjoy this app and being able to track my calories, carbs, protein etc. the major problem I have is the app doesn‚Äôt know the difference between total carbs and net carbs. So for all you Atkins users and people like me who are blending Atkins food/snacks into our keto diet, I recommend you create your own food instead of using the search results. Otherwise the app will say you‚Äôre getting X number of carbs when you‚Äôre actually getting Y number of NET carbs. I would also like to be able to alter the stuff that automatically comes up. If you find Boar‚Äôs Head stuff, for example, you cannot alter the nutritional info. Which points you back in the direction of just creating your own custom food. Other than that this app is great!"
20,20,5,2018-03-28T00:12:47.000Z,Peeperjj,Newbie but love it!,"I‚Äôm only a week in and I love it. You can post on other peoples journals and they on yours. You can follow and gather followers, weight checks daily if you wish, easy bar scanner, can add your own recipes in and track every single calorie to know exactly where you should cut back."
21,21,5,2020-01-08T15:35:17.000Z,Victoria Vibezzzzz,Really good app for calorie intake and nutrition balance,"I‚Äôve been tracking my calories and food on this app and I love it! My doctor put me on a 1200 calorie diet to lose weight. This encourages me to eat at home more and and track my ingredients down to the brand. Some brands of things are not available so sometimes I‚Äôll choose a standard description which is probably not off by much if any. It also helps me to discipline my eating habits. I enter in what I plan to eat before I eat it so that I know I‚Äôm not going to go over my calorie limit and to see if I am balancing out on fat, protein, and carbs. Most cases I want more protein and less fat and carbs. This app shows a chart that keeps up with this! This helps tremendously! Definitely worth the download!"
22,22,5,2021-01-10T21:45:17.000Z,Vannfe,Suggestion,"Love the app, but have a suggestion and there wasn't an option for sending one in the app. It would be nice if we could put the time of our meals in. So you can set reminders for eating, water, or vitamins. Just setting a reminder time isn't enough because schedules change. Your wakeup time and subsequent breakfast may vary from day to day, as mine does. So setting the same reminder schedule isn't sufficient. This way you'll know when you last ate and can remind yourself to eat again at whatever duration works for you. I need to eat every 3-4 hrs or I binge. But I'll get busy and totally forget for 6, then it's a recipe for disaster. Or I don't consume all of my prepped food for the day, which is just as bad."
23,23,5,2020-09-27T12:08:16.000Z,An-other F.S. lover,Worthwhile Effort for Weight Loss,"I had reached a goal with the Keto Diet and wanted to find an app that would take what foods I input and give me the calories, carbs, fat and protein percentage needed to keep losing weight gradually while converting to the Mediterranean Diet.  I have been very satisfied with this app as I tend to eat healthy but occasionally give myself too many ‚Äúgreen lights‚Äù.  This App has made me think about what I am eating weekly.  I input my menu for the coming week over the weekend.  I shop accordingly and prepare overnight breakfasts, grains, etc. ahead.  I am eating more balanced and satisfying meals. I am able to see results both visually and physically and feel good while doing it.  I strongly recommend this diet.  Easy does it!"
24,24,5,2019-12-06T13:00:40.000Z,frananicolini,Excellent resource,"I started using fat secret to count my sugars. As a diabetic, I have to be careful with refined sugars, carbs, and starches, and some things spoke my levels more than others. Using this tool has not only helped me figure out which foods are no-no‚Äôs for me, it‚Äôs also helped me lose weight. The menu planner counts sugars, calories, fats, etc., for me. I don‚Äôt have to think about everything. There‚Äôs a weigh in page to record weight loss progress, and even a spot to put in your own recipes for easy recall. There‚Äôs a community attached, as well- people there are helpful, make great suggestions, and just generally support one another‚Äôs journeys. Overall, I'm very impressed with this valuable (and free!!!) resource."
25,25,5,2021-01-29T20:54:39.000Z,dnj2005,Best App Ever!!!,This app is amazing! It is so easy to use. I‚Äôve lost 7lbs in 10 days. I love how easy it is to look up a variety of different foods. It is also easy to add new foods. It will even give me nutritional value and serving size for my favorite recipes. It links to my health app so I only have to update one app instead of two.
26,26,5,2021-08-11T20:59:17.000Z,Vote üíô,Finally!,I LOVE this app! You can keep track of your calories without all the annoying ‚Äúreminders‚Äù and other useless prompts. I read some guy‚Äôs rant on Quora about how the only ‚Äúdiet‚Äù that works is one where you are in a calorie deficit DAILY. A üí° went off and since then I have been tracking my calories and try to keep below 1400.  I have been very successful at this even on vacation. I scrutinize everything I put in my mouth and constantly look for healthier swaps or ways to cut back. In 11 weeks I‚Äôve lost 14 pounds without having to kill myself with strenuous workouts. I‚Äôve had trouble losing weight most of my adult life but now feel like I‚Äôve beat that demon! üòä
27,27,4,2021-06-14T10:39:31.000Z,mckenna_x0,User friendly & very helpful!,"I did weight watchers for a while and I absolutely loved it. It worked well for me but I still struggled so I stopped, gained weight & realized almost a month ago that I wasn‚Äôt happy with how I looked and my blood work wasn‚Äôt where it should be for a 25 year old. I figured I would do something different and count calories instead of points and that‚Äôs when I discovered FatSecret! It‚Äôs so easy to use and navigate. You can scan barcodes and they have almost everything you could imagine. You can track your weight, track how much you‚Äôve eaten and how many calories you have left for the day. I‚Äôve lost 11 lbs in 3 weeks so this app is definitely worth a try."
28,28,5,2021-05-19T13:30:30.000Z,SmileyEni,This app is a lifesaver lol,"At this point everyone knows that quarantine has affected a lot of people‚Äôs weight and for me it was weight gain. I finally decided I should start losing the pounds by ‚Äúdieting‚Äù first and realized after talking to friends I don‚Äôt need to necessarily cut off certain foods completely but just eat in smaller portions. After searching up calorie trackers online, FatSecret came up, I gave it a try, and now I‚Äôm genuinely committed to my health and my goal of weight loss! I haven‚Äôt stopped using it, and keeping track of the foods I eat while interacting with others in the social part of the platform has been a great motivator for me. Get the app!!!"
29,29,5,2021-06-15T17:57:31.000Z,Bowie2018!,Better than the rest!,"I have used all kinds of apps to track my weight and what I am eating, but have always returned to Fat Secret.  Why?  Because in every other app I had to Google the nutrient amount of each food and add it manually.  Fat Secret offers the basic weight tracking and complete nutrition information, as well as a page where others share recipes and offer advise or congratulations, again without cost.  If you want more tracking it‚Äôs offered as a step up, i.e. water tracking, etc.  I have used Fat Secret for years and have stopped wasting money trying to find something better."
30,30,5,2018-05-24T18:16:43.000Z,Larlieloo,Very useful and easy to use,"This app is great to be conscious of what you‚Äôre eating and exercising as well. The nutritional value of the food is calculated for you when you enter the amount you‚Äôve eaten. It is very user-friendly, easy to use and understand. Many foods have already been entered, and you can manually enter your own recipes to learn the calorie counts and nutritional information. By being conscious of what I‚Äôm eating, I‚Äôve been able to reduce my caloric input and I‚Äôve lost 9 pounds so far. There is also a feature where you can connect with others for encouragement and ideas and recipes."
31,31,5,2018-05-26T13:30:42.000Z,chosejoy,Good system focused on nutrients,I really appreciate the focus on protein/fat/carbs and micronutrients as well. I really appreciate that you can fully customize all of those individual pieces! Not to mention the community of people posting is so encouraging! I‚Äôm still amazed that many positive people can be connecting on an app without some Negative Nancy‚Äôs. It‚Äôs easy to use once you figure it out. (Is there a video somewhere we could watch that shows you how to access all the various features? I couldn‚Äôt find the diet calendar that shows calories in/out for awhile). All I wish we could do is scan barcodes!
32,32,4,2018-11-03T13:03:02.000Z,Mr. Sir Dude Man Guy,"App‚Äôs Improving, but...",Fat Secret has improved so much over the years.
33,33,5,2021-01-13T15:49:50.000Z,girl_with_brown_eyes,No nonsense calorie counter!,"Honestly, the name of this app was a little off putting but I decided to give it a shot because I just don‚Äôt like the other more popular blue app to count calories. Fat Secret is easy to use, has minimal ads, recipe calculator/cookbook, recipes, community, challenges, browser access, food photo journal that you can choose to share with the community or not, and recipes, fitness tracker, a calendar to see which days you tracked and which you didn‚Äôt! It‚Äôs full service! It even has a service for adding your health professional‚Äôs email so you can send your data to them! It‚Äôs incredible!"
34,34,5,2021-03-19T14:47:29.000Z,818CALI*Des,Great tracker,This app is amazing‚Ä¶ You can track all of your daily intake‚Ä¶ See if you‚Äôre on track‚Ä¶ It tells you how many calories and carbs are in each item individually‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs recipes that are shared‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs people sharing comments back-and-forth‚Ä¶ It also connects to your active fit app‚Ä¶ Which all together you have reports to see if you‚Äôre staying on track and it‚Äôs very easy to use. I recommend it.
35,35,4,2019-08-27T21:05:07.000Z,._Alex_B,Awesome!,"FatSecret has been an app I‚Äôve been using for 2 months now and it is extremely helpful! It helps me keep count of my calories and what I love is that you can scan the barcode of the food item and it will tell you how many calories and the name of it, it also has all the restaurants/ fast food places so if you eat at one of them, you can go under that fast food place and select the items you ate. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about this is (trigger warning) the option that tells you how many calories you had after purging, but other than that, it‚Äôs great! Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre on a diet or trying to lose weight."
36,36,5,2020-06-20T00:04:44.000Z,Michfossle,Makes food tracking easy and rewarding.,This app has changed how I approach food. I know how to eat healthy but I eat too much at times and had no grip on my fiber intake. I have found real foods that I truly enjoy to snack on and it allows me to choose what food I really don‚Äôt want to let go of.
37,37,4,2021-05-07T15:56:24.000Z,RMKRaven,It‚Äôs Free and It Works!!,"I started with this App a month ago.  I actually set up three Free Apps, ran all three for a week, and decided this was the most User-Friendly of them all.  It is relatively easy to look up the different foods we eat, the Charts it provides are helpful and informative.  It‚Äôs fairly easy to customize the amount of each food you‚Äôre using.  I don‚Äôt use the Recipe section but it looks impressive.  The single biggest opportunity, even though it‚Äôs a Free App, would be to allow us to choose our own week as opposed to it being Monday to Sunday;  that‚Äôs a bit of a pain albeit not the end of the world.  But that‚Äôs why I docked it one Star"
38,38,3,2021-03-22T20:27:41.000Z,Ally-Kattz,"Love the idea, hate some things.","While the plans and recipes are great, you are not allowed to access except through the App. Okay great, give me an option to download the meal plan I paid for, or the ability to copy/paste it for later. Having some ableness issues makes this difficult to use unless you‚Äôre using your IOS or google store product. Don‚Äôt say, oh get a big tablet so you can see it. I can‚Äôt afford a big enough tablet."
39,39,5,2020-04-30T18:43:23.000Z,pumpkinpie1111111,Super user friendly and convenient App!,"I was looking for the app to be able to count the calories intake and none was working for me. Those I‚Äôve tried before were difficult to navigate and look for food I ate. This app is super user friendly, finds a lot of food and offers measuring in oz, grams, cups, prices, etc. It also allows you to scan a barcode and immediately returned the product you are looking for. It also offers additional meal plans for pay, which I haven‚Äôt tried but might in a later time."
40,40,5,2018-05-09T10:32:22.000Z,Love Wagon,FatSecret is a godsend,"For everyone looking to chart calorie intake-review macro and micro nutrient analysis and record work out achievements-this is the tool for you. Amazing intuitiveness-reliable developer support and of course-the support of the online FatSecret community makes this tool a must have for anyone looking to improve upon their wellness. I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied if it were free-oh wait, it is free."
41,41,5,2018-09-14T14:42:35.000Z,Airwin6,Calorie Counting,"I love this app, FatSecret, so easy to use .  I‚Äôve been 40lbs over weight for 10 years.  I thought I could lose weight on my own by just watching my food intake and portion control, but all I have been doing is maintaining my weight, not gaining any more but not losing it either.  Since using this app and actually recording my food and calories I‚Äôm a lot more aware of unnecessary snacking and actual portion sizes. I‚Äôve lost 5 lbs in 2-1/2 weeks, not a lot so far, but I finally feel on track to permanent weight loss and then maintaining my goal weight. Thank you, I love this app."
42,42,5,2018-10-27T12:53:30.000Z,ArtemisCF,So great and easy to use!,"I‚Äôve been so thrilled with using this app.  It‚Äôs allowed me to easily track my eating throughout the day.  Best of all, unlike a certain other app I had to delete eventually, FatSecret doesn‚Äôt have all of those annoying ads and hide their features away behind costly paywalls.  The library of available food is constantly growing (and I love making my own contributions) and I‚Äôm happy to see my weight tracked as I continue my healthier lifestyle."
43,43,3,2019-01-18T23:37:27.000Z,DLoAlwaysReady,Incorrect Information,"I would love to give this so a 5 star rating. It is really helpful and I use it often. But being on a strict diet I need the information to be accurate. Far to often the information listed does not match the labels on the product. Case in point today I saw a marinara sauce where the label says 8g of carbs with 3g of fiber. The app says 10g and 1g. For people using a Keto/Paleo plan, that difference is significant. If it was possible to make the changes on the app it would be a great help. Also, using homemade recipes with information available for nutrients etc, it would be great to be able to add the recipes. I haven't seen where that is possible. Those two changes would make it a 5 star app easily."

I was a faithful My Fitness Pal user on and off for years until I did an update and they wanted to charge me to remove ads that I didn‚Äôt have before the update. I‚Äôm glad they did because I would have never found Fat Secret. This app is free. However, if I were to spend any money on a health app it would be this one‚Ä¶Fat Secret!"
46,46,5,2019-08-18T13:03:15.000Z,BAY2WI,Great app and it works!,"I love this app. After many years, I am a Weight Watchers convert. This app tells me every calorie I am eating and how many I am burning. I had a few questions along the way, but got them answered quickly by the support staff. I do wish that when selecting portions of an item that 1/3 and 2/3 was available to select. Many recipes call for thirds and it isn‚Äôt an option. This would make an already great app an excellent app. I‚Äôm 69 and it isn‚Äôt easy to lose weight at this age, but I‚Äôve lost 5 of the 15 pounds I want to lose using this app. This app is easy to use and addicting."

I liked the reports and visuals. It was free and without intrusive ads.  It was fairly easy to add foods after/during meals.  Good for short term nutrition survey or maybe serious calorie counters."

It also shows the calories and serving sizes for each item, which is great because you can eat various foods and enjoy all kinds of things if you keep the serving sizes under control. The app also helps you to keep track of all your food choices so you‚Äôre not just mindlessly eating and consuming endless calories. It has in app purchase available which I don‚Äôt use the basic app is good enough to log your food journal and help you stay on track."

50,50,4,2019-01-17T00:20:11.000Z,gymhardbeatz,Overall,"Great app for beginners, has a lot of food to log and what isn‚Äôt on the app can be inputted manually. The interaction with others through the app news feed is also a great feature to keep you on track and updated with other users. Giving only 4 stars because not all work outs/exercise can be searched and sometimes the calories tracked per exercise per minute/ hour isn‚Äôt 100% accurate so jut keep track of your calories burned when exercising and manually adjust the number according to your accurate number."

But Motivation and constant Change!,This app is simply amazing I was doing a single subject research design on myself to change up my lifestyle and I must say the energy that was gain and recovered from this app assisted me with a lot with locating who I was before who I will be tomorrow and the person that will live on for decades to come being healthy because of the fat secret day this is much needed and I have recommended to over 50 to 60 people think you Fat Secret App!! Thanks to you I lost 18 pounds in a month and a half!!! I am now 10 pounds away from my future goals!
52,52,5,2021-03-17T15:01:35.000Z,Tn2ut,Similar to Noom,"I used noom before this and it was good. I wanted to get back into that model but couldn‚Äôt afford the cost of noom, so I searched alternative options that worked similar to that but free or low cost. So glad I did, one month in I‚Äôve lost 8 lbs and not felt hungry or deprived. I‚Äôm making yummy dinners for the family and eating everything they are. This just helps me pay attention to how much I‚Äôm consuming of those foods. My stomach has shrunk, I‚Äôm guessing, because I‚Äôm enjoying all this but not feeling like eating nearly the quantities I used to eat. Feeling lighter and satisfied."

Plus, I was very honest no cheating. Meaning I logged everything. In 7 months just by accurately knowing my cal intake versus my cal burn I always stayed at a deficit. In 7 months I lost very slowly 20lbs. This diet and my daily walking and every other day gym weight routine was an effort that paid off. I feel the best in 25 years. I‚Äôm wearing cloths again that were my favorites. Thank goodness I kept them. Oh, I‚Äôm 66 years old. Never let anyone tell you it‚Äôs too late. It‚Äôs not. :)"

I lost over 100 pounds because the app makes one mindful of what‚Äôs going in and out. I‚Äôve met wonderful encouraging people on the app as well.
55,55,5,2020-05-03T13:27:47.000Z,shen*ming,"If you know what you‚Äôre wanting to do, this is an AWESOME tracker","If you know your calorie marks, this is a great way to enter them in and keep track. You can track exercise and weight too. There‚Äôs a bar graph for weight and you can set a target. I used Noom for about a week and that was good but I ultimately decided not to pay $25/month for it. This app is free and fantastic. A little clunky in entering Saved Meals and figuring out initially how to set your own calorie target if you don‚Äôt want to use their auto-calculated one, but you get the hang of it after a couple days. Five stars."
56,56,5,2020-01-26T13:42:50.000Z,cheskamarie88,Love this app,This app saved me from wrongfully counting calories and actually keep track of my meals . I‚Äôve seen progress since working with this app I‚Äôve lost 20 pounds thus far and I actually can‚Äôt thank the developers enough. Plus you can interact with people with the same goals as you and get tips from them too!  Honestly I couldn‚Äôt be anymore satisfied. And yes it is free! But if you want a meal plan included you will have to pay a fee but I think it‚Äôs worth it . So yea enjoy the app and hope you discover something new within this app about yourself üòá
57,57,4,2019-06-19T09:42:53.000Z,teresa tarr brown,Great but could be better.,I have been using this app through out my weight loss journey.  I have kept 80 lbs off for over 5 years now. Just started keto diet recently and down 8 more lbs. I am a diabetic. This keeps track of carbs too and that‚Äôs a great help to me. The only thing I would recommend is making it easier to look up restaurant foods.  By putting the restaurant and the menu item. It always takes me on a wild goose chase when I try to do this. 46 lbs to go to meet my goal. And by the way.  I have not had any weight loss surgery.  Trying to be healthy. Teresa Brown.

58,58,4,2019-06-10T12:52:49.000Z,kdk2019,Gem in the rough,"When I started my weight loss journey I downloaded this app but only used it to find the macros on select foods, using another macro tracking program for daily use. I did not realize what I had until the other program upgraded itself out of practical use. That‚Äôs another story. I started more fully exploring and LOVE this app now. The only thing I find counterintuitive is the ability to quickly add the odd food that is not listed in its extensive library. To be able to add 4 g of carbs here or a couple of grams of fat there to my intake without having to add a new food would be fabulous."
59,59,4,2021-06-25T15:47:03.000Z,angelbabe225,Best free meal tracking app I have used!,This app is far from the worst I have used. I love that it keeps track of your previously logged foods so you dont have to keep entering them.

61,61,5,2018-08-23T15:21:56.000Z,CaityQD,Love the community,"I love this app, it had helped me lose a significant amount of weight in the past. For some reason I stopped using it and gained much of it back over the past two years. I tried using a different app (MyFitnessPal) but there were too many ads and the reminders automatically shut off if you forget to log for a few days. Anyway, I prefer FatSecret. My only suggestion would be to add an area to track measurements and store progress photos. Other than that, I love the community and simplicity of the app."
62,62,4,2018-10-28T13:41:43.000Z,Tabotimo,Good variety of preselects and easy to use,"I have an older iPad, so some of the fitness apps wont work with my IOS.  Which ended up being a good thing, because I wouldn't have gone to this app first, but I like it better than any of the other ones I have used.  I use this app primarily as a calorie counter, and it has been excellent for that.  It has a user friendly set up, and a nice menu of pre entered foods to make entering my calorie counts more simple.  I have had great success with it.  As of today I have lost 10 1/2 pounds in about 2 months since I began using this app to help me keep myself accountable."
63,63,5,2020-04-06T13:45:18.000Z,Kaitimk3,Perfect and relatively free,"This app honestly has changed my life. What FatSecret offers is free to a certain extent which is you would have to pay for using other apps. It has impacted my life in a positive way by easily allowing me to track what I eat so that I can live a healthier lifestyle. There are food plans too that come with the subscription which is honestly one of the cheaper ones which is great if your trying to save money! Overall, this is app is wonderful. Just remember to be accountable and your journey should be pleasant on the app as well"

I am tired of all the fitness apps that require a payment for every separate section of the app, these people are not interested in the wellbeing of their users but I do not feel the way with Fat Secret. The food diary is extremely user friendly and helps me see more than just the amount of calories I‚Äôm taking in. I also see the proteins the fats, carbs, sugars, etc. all for free. I‚Äôve lost 13 pounds of purely stubborn fat and I attribute a lot of that towards this app."

It is made for people who buy items at the store and use them in recipes. I have congestive heart failure, so I Keep sodium intake to less than 2000mg per day. I have entered many recipes over the years. One of them is for breakfast sausage. I wanted to use this sausage in another recipe, but could not because it is a recipe not a food. I had to enter it as a food before I could use it in another recipe. Why not just pull my recipes over as foods so I don‚Äôt have to do double entry."

One might think because of all the pasta and carbohydrates but no! Not me! I hardly ever eat pasta or pizza. So, I would starve myself and eat off fruit only more or less! Little did I know, fruit was my enemy ü§™ As soon as I started counting calories and having a more balanced diet, I realized how high-calorie some fruit could be. I haven‚Äôt lost much yet (only 3pounds in 3 weeks) but I know it‚Äôs working. Thank you Fat Secret team!"

69,69,3,2021-07-03T16:51:50.000Z,losingCovidPounds,Men√∫ planner recipes poor quality,I have only used the free part of the app less than a week. It is ok. I subscribed to the meal planner yesterday. I thought it would give me some good ideas for meals and recipes. The recipes are not well written. I wonder if they were just submitted by users and not proofed. They leave out ingredients that are then mentioned in the directions. Or they include ingredients on the list but give no directions on how to incorpora te them in the recipe. The units of ingredients are sometimes ambiguous or not easily measured. I think I saw one as ‚Äúone unit‚Äù of a 2 pound package of chicken. So this bonus feature may be useful but don‚Äôt subscribe for the recipes.
70,70,4,2018-02-04T12:32:57.000Z,behrsden,FLGirl,I‚Äôd like to give this app 5 stars but either I am doing something wrong or the feature to add a recipe and FIND it isn‚Äôt working.  I reached a level of frustration having entered three recipes.  As I enter them I save the pages or sections that ask me to...I review it when I‚Äôm done and then hit save again (because it asks you to) and the recipe goes away as though the process is complete.

The same with butter, and wheat bread nothing matched.  I attempted to add the bread but I couldn‚Äôt figure out how.  Why does it have to be so agonizing to do this.  I wanted something that would help and make it easier but I will use my food log I started because it takes me about twenty minutes to do a whole day.  I would have to get up two hours early to do this app.  This should help but it doesn‚Äôt.  I thought when I read the reviews people were being dramatic, but I understand now...skinny people did this app while they where laughing at fat people. Thanks"
72,72,5,2020-08-18T10:14:45.000Z,biggerfishy,Excellent,"This app is very good.  And since it is free it moves to the excellent category.   The interface is easy to understand.  It‚Äôs similar to  the WW app.  I like the weight graph and nutrition data.  Meal entry is a nice feature.  The database of food is smaller then WW app. And when I‚Äôve added things, it hasn‚Äôt always been easy to find them again.   I also don‚Äôt like the following other people interface, but I didn‚Äôt like this on WW either.  Overall, hard to beat the value for cost/ad ratio.  I haven‚Äôt tried any of the meal plans."

It is so easy to enter the foods you eat, and it has helped me understand exactly how I am feeding my body. I focus mostly on protein intake, and the fats and carbohydrates naturally show up with the addition of fruits and vegetables. It also helps when deciding whether or not to add pleasure calories like beer and ice cream. There is no substitute for tracking what you eat, and FatSecret is the perfect tool to make this an easy part of your daily routine!"

I had been looking for an all inclusive app where I could input my weight along with the foods that I‚Äôm eating, and it be able to calculate my macros along with the calories remaining for the day. And that is what this app does. It also has more updates choices of food to pick from as well. For instance, when I eat out at different places, it has the information for those products as well for me to add into my food diary. And all of these features are FREE!! I absolutely love this app!"

This app also gives you the macros which a lot of other apps don't do (or don't do for free). The one problem I have is that I cannot find anyway to add my boyfriend so that we can view each other's logs. I've tried so many things and I've Googled how to but I can't find it. I don't think it exists and I want it so bad!! Please add! Then this app would be perfect."

I have been very impressed with all of the info available and how this app works. There is a large database of foods including many restaurants. You can take a photo of a barcode and see the nutrition Info right on your screen.  I tried out many apps before deciding this is the best one. I highly recommend this app if you want help keeping up with your calorie intake. I am using the free version and it has everything I need.

There are so many catalogued foods including popular brands it makes completing a food diary so easy.  The reports & visual graphs are cool to track components. You can save meals for future input, recent entries are visible in search and Im pretty sure you can enter new foods- I just haven‚Äôt done that yet. I reduced 1 star because sometimes navigation within the day is awkward. I end ip opening the search when I want to open &  my entries to edit them; however, this could be needing to learn how to use the app better."

I have been able to add foods and it usually memorizes them. I can‚Äôt understand the menu or meal function. I wanted to input my own recipes for meals and have it save but couldn‚Äôt figure out how to do it. I also wish it was easier to add raw foods in different measurements, for example a plain red bell pepper in all measurements from tbsp to a cup. There are no listings for plain regular foods like vegetables/fruits in multiple measurements. I think the UI could be made simpler."

It is so easy to use, great visuals, which makes it easy to track macros throughout the day. You can share food logs, which displays into a spreadsheet, so it super easy to hold yourself accountable by emailing food logs to a health coach, friend, etc. It also has an endless list of foods in its data base. I think only 1 time this year I had to manually enter in a food - rest of the time, scan barcode and there it is.  If all this doesn‚Äôt get better - it‚Äôs free!"

I found that it was easy to use, simple and easy to understand and navigate. I have lost 20 lbs so far using the app to adjust my meals... if I find a certain meal has too many carbs I simply adjust the amount until I get the macros balanced out... great tool easy to use"

What has been most helpful is the ‚Äúsaved meal‚Äù feature for meals I eat on a regular basis.  Even after not using the app for a few years, my saved meals were still available.  I only use the app when I am actively trying to lose weight, but it‚Äôs a great way to get back on track when I have been left to my own devices for awhile."

When I go back to recently eaten for breakfast I now see foods that I usually have for lunch/dinner/snacks and it‚Äôs very annoying. I liked the old version where my recently eaten for breakfast was only breakfast foods. You can see it on most eaten section but if I have something occasionally it won‚Äôt show so it takes longer to scroll through all of my recently eaten foods. Wish they‚Äôd go back to the old version!"

Apparently I am just eating too much for my slowing metabolism.  This app has helped me track my calories and helps me stay accountable.  I am more aware and conscious of mu choices now.  I still get to eat what I want, but am making healthier choices and watching portions.  I‚Äôve tried several apps and this one has done the trick.  I like the visual graphs, the weigh ins and the fact that it counts calories for me so I don‚Äôt have to do the math."

If the item you ate isn‚Äôt already in the database you can easily scan the upc and add it. You can easily see your nutrition intake by meal or by day. Carbs, protein, fat etc.  Added bonus you can link your Fitbit to track your activity level."
91,91,5,2017-10-05T14:54:56.000Z,Jsmith1750,Very helpful app,Been using this app for years now and it‚Äôs helped tremendously.  Lost 55 pounds the first time and put a few back on recently when my dad passed. I monitored my intake again closely and have lost another 20.
92,92,4,2018-06-17T12:06:33.000Z,MsLesMis,Great resource and self tracking tool!,I found this app several years ago and found it useful but stopped using it until I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes a few weeks ago. I found it again and it has improved and is helping me stay up with my carb tracking and weight loss.  The only problem I see is that the food search results (and restaurants too) aren‚Äôt in alpha order and if there are errors in the nutrition entries I see no way to correct them.  But I‚Äôm adjusting and it still is a fabulous tool!!
93,93,3,2018-08-18T05:39:52.000Z,Jude 536,Comprehensive tracking,"I just opened this app and am comparing it with another one that I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm going to keep. So far, it‚Äôs great at giving comprehensive information. I‚Äôm getting used to the interface."

96,96,4,2019-07-10T12:04:02.000Z,Ptmholmes,Works for the self-motivated,"The struggle with this app, like MFP, is discipline about taking the time to log everything. I moved from MFP because FatSecret doesn‚Äôt have ads and constant upselling, but the logging system is just a little less smooth. In any case, worth the move simply for the more beautiful UI. I haven‚Äôt gotten to the many social features within this app yet since I‚Äôm (secret) still as soft as rotten fruit. But once I get ripped, catch me taking bicep selfies and promoting protein powder on FatSecret. Minus one star because I still only look like Hugh Jackman from the neck up."
97,97,5,2021-01-20T04:16:56.000Z,WhitneyPJ,Better than my fitness pal,Just downloaded this app and am already in love. This app is way better than my fitness pal and cheaper. Fat secret makes it super easy to track your meals and type in desired goals. You can even track your macros and set goals for your specific food category. Worried it won‚Äôt have your meal? Don‚Äôt! This app has a ton of options and even has an option for you to add the meal manually. So happy I tried this app! I promise this app won‚Äôt disappoint.
98,98,5,2021-01-05T00:46:03.000Z,MommaKat73,Easy to use,"There are great people on here. No judgement, work at your own pace and easy to use the app. I have rarely found a brand or a good product they do not already have the exact portion and amount of calories already figured out. All you have to do is tell it what you ate. No more trying to figure it out. Or measuring portions! It even has restaurants so you can figure out what you are going to eat before you go. I would definitely recommend this app."
99,99,5,2019-08-20T15:08:51.000Z,randyharris,"Awesome tool to track your diet, nice with the social feed as well.",This app rolls everything into a great package. Tracking your weight has nice charts and is visual. Tracking foods is very simple you can search for items create your own items and menus. Very easy tracks all the macro nutrients very well. If you‚Äôre trying to lose your weight or just keep track of what you‚Äôre eating this is a fantastic app for it. The social feed is a very nice touch as well and as a bit of community to it.
100,100,5,2017-12-22T13:59:28.000Z,MrMovember,Best calorie tracking app with a few shortcomings,1. The calorie calculations are not accurate. I just ignore them and do the calculations in a separate medium. Sometimes they are way off. Please check that.
101,101,4,2018-02-14T18:27:41.000Z,Livright 2016,Impressive interface with iPhone health,I just downloaded this app yesterday and am very happy that it syncs with Apple‚Äôs health data app. I use the Apple Watch to track calories. I logged my food yesterday for the first time in this app and noticed my calories burned for the day was posted at the top of my daily food log. How cool is that! I deducted one star because I had to manually input some foods for example Shari‚Äôs Berries did not turn up any results but MyFitness app had all the Shari‚Äôs Berries products. This may become easier as users build the data base.
102,102,5,2018-07-30T12:38:24.000Z,mdp1010,Finally something that works for me!,This app works for me because it allows me to track carbs easily. I type in what I eat (or want to eat) and immediately I know if that is a good choice for me. It includes brand name foods so you can find foods from Trader Joe‚Äôs and Wegmans.
103,103,4,2018-11-02T04:34:00.000Z,Moon mash,Great tracking tool for weigh loss,"This app is a great tool to track weight loss.  The only downside is that if you are on a specific diet that requires you to calculate off the nutrition label, it doesn‚Äôt automatically do it for you. Because app users have the ability to download pics,  share stories, and comment, it creates a supportive environment to motivate each other. I highly recommend this app to anyone who is looking for an easy way to track their weight loss progress and is serious about achieving their goal!"
104,104,5,2021-03-15T14:22:26.000Z,SinglesSource.US,so easy to count calories and track exercise,"FatSecret is by far the best calorie counter app on the market- I really like the diet calendar that visually allows you to see multiple days of calories eaten and exercise calories burned so you can tweak your diet plan according to this history. FatSecret has tons of restaurants built into the search so if you‚Äôre out at restaurant that ‚Äúhides‚Äù the calories, you can still order intelligently. Much better than ‚Äúlose it‚Äù app in my opinion."
105,105,5,2021-01-16T02:20:41.000Z,Kweenb 001,Love how easy it is to use this app,I don‚Äôt pay for the premium but what is included for free is what I was looking for. I just wanted to track my food daily. Bonus with this app is you can search foods for your log and many things are there with all nutritional info. Some things aren‚Äôt and yuh have to option to add it manually. It also has me weigh in weekly and keep track of my progress. You can set up a personalized daily goal for your dietary needs. I love it!
106,106,5,2019-06-21T16:24:24.000Z,finchbird42,It‚Äôs SO easy,"I‚Äôve checked out many apps but I keep sticking with Fat Secret. It‚Äôs a simple app and doesn‚Äôt have any distractions. I love that it shows how many macros I eat each day. Many apps charge extra for this. I also love that I can count everything in grams, IMO this is one of the best features. It‚Äôs not pretty and in color like other apps, but it‚Äôs simple, efficient, and best of all, super easy to use. And you never get pestered to upgrade or have annoying ads. It truly is the best!"
107,107,1,2021-04-15T01:32:12.000Z,ImaginaryMusicLover,Why can‚Äôt I manually enter calories?,"The only way to log your calories in, is if you use the barcode scanner or search for foods in their search bar."
108,108,4,2020-08-28T12:09:00.000Z,IGBella,Exceeded expectations,"The last thing I wanted to do was keep a log of my daily intake, but this app has made it easy AND helped me stay focused on my weight loss goal. While it‚Äôs obvious to all of us that eating and drinking less will lead to weight loss, actually keeping track from that first cup of coffee until dinner allowed me to allow myself that glass of wine while staying under my calorie limit set by the app that will result in weight loss. I started about a week ago and I have lost 3.4 lbs. Definitely recommending this to friends"
109,109,5,2021-02-27T01:47:17.000Z,Ericalwumich,Simple and Easy to use,"I just started using this app but I really like it. It‚Äôs easy and had a lot more data in it than I expected for a free app. I am excited to see if I actually follow the caloric diet they suggest if I will lose the last few lbs I‚Äôve been wanting to shed. If anything it helps you be accountable and actually see what you‚Äôre putting into your body. I‚Äôm also nutrient deficient so I hope this helps me stay on top of that too. Stupid name, but good app!"
110,110,5,2018-01-10T14:58:09.000Z,Toddzilla1,Since 2011,"I have been using FatSecret for a very long time.  It is the easiest way I have found to keep track of what I eat. I love how I am able to control proteins, carbs, and sugar counts.  I measure what I want to measure. This app was made for me. I have the ability to go back through the years and read little notes that I journaled. It helps me To not repeat certain mistakes I‚Äôve made. I highly recommend fatsecret. It‚Äôs made to be personal, and I love the privacy. Its so easy!"
111,111,4,2018-05-15T10:13:35.000Z,Trying 2 Lose Weight,Fix This Bug Please!!,Just started using it and I noticed that you can not adjust the ‚Äúresting and relaxing‚Äù time. It only gives you the option to adjust sleep. The app splits the activity into 24 hours so if you sleep 8 hours your relaxing 16 it doesn‚Äôt make sense because it asks you other activities like work & exercise. I can‚Äôt sleep for 8 work for 8 exercise for 2 and rest for 16 hours = 34! Why is this a big deal bcuz this part of the app tracks calories burned! I could be making a big deal out of nothing
112,112,4,2019-02-03T13:57:58.000Z,Karine Bottomo,A Helpful Health Tool,"I've been using FatSecret since the New Year, mostly to track my weight, but I have logged several meals with the app as well. It's a simple health tool that can be used to hold yourself accountable for whatever goals you have set for yourself. I broke my resolutions for about two weeks, but I just had to get back on track and FatSecret was the tool I came back to without feeling any guilt or shame. I just picked up where I left off. Like any app, it's a tool and it's efficacy is all dependent on how you use it."
113,113,1,2019-02-06T18:25:14.000Z,sunny_556,Unfortunately macros are not accurate,"Unlike MyFitnessPal, there is no ‚Äúverified checkmark‚Äù for simple vegetable macros. Every single vegetable has been way off and inaccurate in terms of fats and carbs. This makes me have to enter my OWN entry for veggies, which is a process in itself. I liked the app at first for its easy ‚Äúsaving‚Äù when selecting multiple food items. The barcode scanner is also helpful. But this app needs a more accurate and trusted library. This also needs a ‚Äúquick add‚Äù macro option rather than having to add an entire new food choice. Sadly have to go back to MyFitnessPal because of this feature. Can‚Äôt spend all my time entering all my own custom values for vegetables."

Along with weight and calorie tracking, the user has the option to interact socially with  people who are supportive and humorous. There are recipes, meal plans(for a fee) and a way to search for consumed food using a search phrase or a photo which works a lot better than I expected. All in all, I highly recommend it üëçüèº"

The bottom line is, the less you eat, the faster you lose weight. I don‚Äôt care how many crunches you do or miles you run, if you‚Äôre still eating like crap, you‚Äôre not going to lose weight. That‚Äôs why this Fat Secret is so fantastic! I love this app! Now I know exactly how many calories I am digesting, and where I‚Äôm putting the emphasis of my food."

I bought a pudding cake for a neighborhood picnic. It was one of those Kroger bakery special recipes. I looked it up on FatSecret, and there it was! Kroger Cinnamon Pecan Pudding Cake! Glad I didn‚Äôt eat some! Went to Johnny Carino‚Äôs while traveling. Had its Primavera Chicken. Looked it up, and there it was in the app. It keeps track of my weight timeline, breaks down food nutrients, etc. Amazing! Did I say that already?!"

I feel like I became my own Nutritionist because it gives me all the info about food that I need to know and alongside the knowledge I have acquired, it allows me to control every aspect of my diet and even shape the way my mind operates when it comes to eating healthier. Thanks to the FatSecret team. You are changing lives."

This is great for people doing Keto diets. It also shows me where I‚Äôm at in my calorie count for the day. I‚Äôve learned a lot about food in this program."
121,121,4,2018-02-15T01:24:22.000Z,Jmck28,Needs a vegetable category,"I‚Äôve been using this for about a month now. It‚Äôs relatively easy to use and has a decent sized database. I wish there was a way to favorite foods that you eat often - sometimes mine don‚Äôt show up in the ‚Äúmost eaten‚Äù category. Also, I wish they would add a vegetables category. Veggies fall under carbs but I think of carbs as bread, so even though I‚Äôm not using this to totally monitor my diet, adding that category would make it easier to see what you may be missing or overdoing it on."

The only thing I don‚Äôt enjoy is the new connectivity options. I don‚Äôt want or need to see other people‚Äôs food or weight journeys. It‚Äôs thankfully an option so I‚Äôm not forced to see it when I open the app."
123,123,3,2018-06-15T02:58:04.000Z,Vnicki,Love the app... But...,"Overall, I love the app. There are however some improvements that I think could be made. For starters, I think the app would benefit if the Recommended daily intake adjusted based on the amount of calories burned in a day. Second, I (personally) think that the scanning feature is a bit complicated. (Maybe it‚Äôs just me), but it can only be used from one specific place. If I am creating a recipe, I can not scan in ingredients. I have to enter them manually. It would be easier if they could be scanned. Just a few suggestions..."

Support and journaling (if that‚Äôs your cuppa tea) for those who want it. Ability to enter your own recipes so you can understand the breakdown of what you make consistently (let‚Äôs face it- we all have like 10-20 recipes we use on a consistent basis- it‚Äôs worth the time to enter these.  Good luck getting your goals everyone!

My favorite part about this app is that it allows me to input everything in grams or milliliters which is a must so I don‚Äôt have to do different measurements for stuff. And if I‚Äôm not mistaken, I think MyFitnessPal only allows for up to 100 g servings and FatSecret doesn‚Äôt. I haven‚Äôt checked the max but I haven‚Äôt need to. All I‚Äôm all, this app freakin rocks!"

The first two days I used the app I recorded everything that I put in in my mouth. I was shocked to see that I had eaten over 8,000 calories in two days!!! It was a definite eye-opener! I started using the app keeping it within 2500 calories, and in two weeks time I lost 8.2 pounds!!! I highly recommend this app and give it a five star rating!!!"

You can look up foods individually, by restaurant, by prepackaged product or even supermarket brands. It tracks calories and macros as well as your weight. You can input sleep and exercise. You can run reports on daily and weekly intake. There are sections for recipes and you can take a picture of your food and the app will help with identifying the contents. There‚Äôs so much more!

132,132,5,2021-06-10T19:06:15.000Z,HlCunningham,Latest version organizes Recently Eaten foods well,In the old days Recently Eaten foods were listed by meal. This made it easy to eat leftovers but hard to eat dinner leftovers at lunch. Then in a recent update Recently Eaten foods were displayed for all meals so leftovers were very difficult. With this latest update Recently Eaten foods are listed by meal followed by other meals which makes it possible to eat leftovers at the same meal easily and at another meal - best of both:-)

All of it is intended to help the dieter tolerate eating fewer calories than they previously consumed. The best way to know if you are on track is to keep track of those calories. This app is fantastic at that and tracks your weight too. The push notifications help keep me going. It doesn‚Äôt work if you don‚Äôt use it. Good Luck!

143,143,4,2020-02-28T17:00:03.000Z,Abreibart,Great app.,Really like all of the features - very helpful in my fat loss regimen. Two things: 1. Add a scanner for auto entry of product barcodes/nutritional info; 2. a HELP menu (I can‚Äôt figure out how to create my own food item entries because the choice doesn‚Äôt always show up. I assume it‚Äôs ignorance on my part that a HELP menu item would solve) or at least a link to your website where help and user questions are archived and/or answered or discussed. Do that and I‚Äôll give 5 stars

It is simple and easy to use with a great calorie calculator food journal, great people to connect with on a main feed, and an easy weigh-in journal that has the option for you to set reminders to get on the scale if you want to."
146,146,4,2020-05-30T19:20:47.000Z,MamaLeBlanc,Favorite diet BUT needs net carbs,I have been using this App for almost 2 years. I have tried other calorie counting and diet Apps and this is by far my favorite. The others have deleted until recently. I recently started the keto diet and I am heartbroken that I have had to use another App simply because this App doesn‚Äôt calculate net carbohydrates which means my daily macro nutrient goals and percentages are not accurate. I really really hope a future update makes net carbs an option.

This is pretty good except that it does not read weight from the health app. It reads activities and writes nutrition but it doesn‚Äôt read weight from Health.

I love it. You can simply add any new foods you choose. The list of food available amazes me every time I search! There are no confusing redirects, no crappy adds! Helped me find what I was doin wrong and correct it!"

I love your app. However, in order for me to pay for the premium, I need to know if it will allow me to add additional ‚Äúsnack‚Äù times & rearrange my meals. For example, I do not like that there‚Äôs only 1 section under snacks. Most people will eat 3 meals and 2-3 snacks per day. I would like to be able to add another snack section and move it around accordingly.  Ie, breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack, etc...  Can you please tell me if the premium option will allow me to do what I am asking? Thank you!"

Tracking macros USA great start to getting your diet under control.  Fat Secret is the third app I‚Äôve tried for tracking.  It was easy from day 1, has a sizable database of foods to enter, and I love the reports functionality.  I think it‚Äôs over-generous on calories burned for exercise, but I have other tools for that.  For tracking macros in, this is the best I‚Äôve used so far."

When I recently looked at my body and decided enough is enough, I searched for phone apps that would help me stay aware and focused on what I was doing and my goals. I am using FatSecret daily and have found it to be of tremendous service to me at this time. If you are serious and dedicated to losing weight this app is the one for you. Give it a go!"
152,152,5,2018-08-12T12:50:21.000Z,MTMAMA1,Love this app!,"To lose weight I need an app that helps me keep track of calories, exercise, and weight. This app does all that. It calculates the maximum daily caloric intake in order to reach your goal, and the extensive list of calories in each food makes this easy to track. The graph charting your progress serves as an incentive to keep striving to meet your goal. You will lose the weight if you strictly follow the guidelines."
153,153,5,2018-08-13T21:19:01.000Z,TopYogi,The easiest and enormously helpful app,"I have used FatSecret since my blood sugar and cholesterol results reflected bad news for me. That was few weeks back. I have since taken up a diet/exercise regimen. That would have been worthless had FatSecret not been there. Its intuitive, well designed so it is very-very easy to use. It has just about right enough information to be successful in your diet plan. Well done!"
154,154,5,2018-11-02T11:28:54.000Z,ndulge,Wonderful tool,"I‚Äôve been using the app now for a little under a month and I love it! I had another app that just wasn‚Äôt helping. You can track calories, macros, see your progress as time goes on and big plus, there is an awesome supportive community that tries to help out when you get stuck. If you‚Äôre newly on a journey of health and fitness this is a wonderful tool to have in your back pocket."

Most foods are already populated in the App so you just search, click, adjust the serving size, and your tracking is complete. Quick and easy. I lost 4 lbs and one inch off my waist in my first month, just by making sure I eat less calories than I burn. So easy to use! Highly recommend."
156,156,4,2019-03-06T11:03:24.000Z,Doyrtm,My favorite Keto App,"Love everything it has but wish it had 1 more feature. I wish it kept a running list to choose from everything you ever ate during any meal. As an example, if I eat some cheese as a snack it remains on the breakfast choice list for later. If I want that same cheese for lunch I have to find it again and add it to lunch. Just would like a tab that has the running list of all you have eaten so you can choose it for what ever meal you want."
157,157,5,2021-05-25T00:57:33.000Z,BertinHouston,Best calorie counting app ever,"Been using the IPhone FatSecret app for a little more than a week and finally have found the tool that is going to keep me on track to my goal. It‚Äôs Boomer easy, intuitive and everything works. The recipe ingredients come out a bit wonky and sometimes it is hard to find fresh leafy items or herbs such as basil leaves. Minor issue. All in all a lifesaver for an aspiring calorie counter!!"
158,158,5,2020-01-06T20:42:29.000Z,Jackmeoffalot,Love this app!,"I scan 90% of the barcodes on products to track my calories, macros and nutrients. Plus the search option has everything for items without barcodes. It‚Äôs simple to use and the reporting feature to track weekly progress is awesome. I was manually tracking my BMR, exercise and calorie intake on an excel spreadsheet I created; this is 10x simpler and always with me by being on my phone."
159,159,1,2020-01-13T09:54:56.000Z,1tjsepe1,"NO""NET""Carbs in pie graph",For us folks on a VERY LOW CARB restricted or KETO diet.... we must keep our NET carbs 25-30g or below per day. We can run a bit above that so long as our NET carbs stays within this range. Although you have a section that will compute and SUBTRACT (-) the FIBER and(+) SUGAR ALCOHOLS from the TOTAL carbs.....this doesn't carry over to the pie charts and reports for the NET CARBS. Please allow the same algorithm or formula to carry over to the charts and reports. With these types of highly POPULAR diets every carb and fraction thereof is crucial. Especially with the KETO diet. We usually try to keep our CARB MACROS around the 5% mark.

In that time period I have went from 426# today at 204#  and still going my goal is 54 pounds away but I continue to use this wonderful tool to improve my health. I no like ne‚Äôer am. Insulin dependent diabetic suffer from hypertension chronic pain depression anxiety hyperlipidemia hyper cholesterol and I went from 12 years in a wheelchair to walking and exercising daily. It‚Äôs not the soul solution but a great tool to better health

If I cooked something for dinner and I have it for lunch, I shoild be able to ‚Äúrepost‚Äù it from my diary the day before into another day. As in be able to replicate the exact same meals foe different days."
162,162,3,2018-09-24T12:12:43.000Z,jrp0529,Be Careful...Don‚Äôt trust the app completely!,"I know that the overwhelming number of reviews for this app are positive and I agree that it is a great tool to track all nutrition information. However, be careful to ALWAYS check nutrition labels. I have kept track over the past week and over 1/2 of the labels in Fat Secret have been wrong. Not off my much but a few calories/carbs here and there can make a difference. It still is a good app but always check the nutrition information for yourself and do NOT trust this app entirely sadly!"
163,163,5,2019-07-31T14:46:11.000Z,Alkelda,"Great app, terrible name","Ignore the fact that this is worst app name ever! I found this app based on an online blog recommendation, and have been very happy with it. Tracking calories is easy to do, and the barcode scanning feature makes it even easier to enter foods. I keep track of my exercise as well, and write notes to refer to later. As of this writing, there are no annoying pop-up ads."
164,164,5,2021-01-09T16:53:23.000Z,VistaObserver,Seems great!,"I really like the UI and how clean the app is. I‚Äôve used my fitness pal before and it often crashed for me, though I think that was mostly because of my phone at the time. This app is simple and doesn‚Äôt hold back features if you‚Äôre trying to track your calories. I haven‚Äôt used any of their premium meal plans yet, but will consider it in the future."
165,165,5,2020-09-06T12:58:55.000Z,DissatisfiedWithNewVersion,FatSecret fan,"I am a big fan of the CalorieCounter by Fatsecret app.  I have tried multiple apps and FatSecret is by far the easiest to use. Since I use a food scale to weigh my food, I like that food weights can be easily entered in grams for most foods that I eat. It saves me trying to do the calculations separately. I also like that I‚Äôm not bothered by a lot of reminders, especially if I go over my calories a little or miss recoding a day."
166,166,5,2020-09-01T18:00:10.000Z,purple_zhaan,Makes it easy to lose and an eye opener for food habits,I did not like the restrictions of any one diet. FatSecret lets ME chose my favorite foods and manage portions towards my goals. It takes calorie counting to a higher level by including the breakdown of the calories and nutrients. It feels more like a game and less like a diet.  I also love the fact that it‚Äôs integrated with my I watch so I know the calories I burned each day.
167,167,5,2020-05-29T15:57:42.000Z,Dreasry,Can‚Äôt enter a recipe,"I have been using Fat Secret for several years. It has been a great tool for me to control my weight. However, I am not able to enter a recipe for a smoothie because I don‚Äôt cook it. Even after upgrading, it requires a cook time. I have tried everything! 5 minutes. 2 hours. Zero (which, being a smoothie is correct). Now it isn‚Äôt a tool at all. Very disappointed!"
168,168,5,2020-04-15T00:11:34.000Z,BarbinNC,Love love love this app,"About 10 years ago I decided to take control of my weight. I went low carb and tracked everything I consumed with a book, notebook, and pen. Lost 48 lbs and was happy. I started to slowly gain, 8 or 9 lbs over the course of 5 or 6 years. I tried Noom and within days I decided that I liked the tracking, but I loathed the coach. I went looking and found this app. It‚Äôs just about perfect for what I need."
169,169,4,2019-06-22T13:04:24.000Z,mommaloosing!,Great app!!!,I love the app it makes you accountable and feel secure in what your eating and how much your eating and your weight progress!! My only issue which is tiny is on the diet calendar some days shows I ate more calories than I actually did and when you go back to the date the actual calories you ate is correct! I know it‚Äôs strange but I don‚Äôt pay attention to the overall calendar I pay attention to the everyday calorie counter!!
170,170,5,2017-11-01T02:13:08.000Z,Homer217,Best I‚Äôve found,"There are a ton of fitness tracking apps. And I‚Äôve tried a tone of them. For my use (low carb diet) this is the best app I‚Äôve found. I use it mainly for tracking food, but it‚Äôs linked to my health app, and it‚Äôs cool to be able to see my calories in VS calories out. Many of the other apps demand a subscription to unlock necessary parts of the app (yes, especially MFP app). This one doesn‚Äôt, and it works great."
171,171,5,2018-01-02T13:04:23.000Z,Eduaccoroni,Excellent app,"I've been using for 4 years and it really works. And the best of all: every functionality is free! No additional purchases. I tried my fitness pal, but you need to pay a monthly subscription to unblock all the functionalities you got for free by using fat secret. Also, the fat secret has more activities options to help you to know how many calories you've burned through the day."
172,172,4,2018-10-11T14:08:20.000Z,4-Kiks,Excellent!!,This is a wonderful app to keep you on track with calorie counting! Especially if you are one of those who need to see how you‚Äôre doing in chart form and have it laid out in front of you. Would‚Äôve gave 5 stars if app kept track of water intake and had good/bad fat ratios instead of counting all fat as bad. Love the communication with others whom are on the same weight loss/healthy journey! I‚Äôm down 16 lbs in 7 weeks with only 4 to go! Thank you fatsecret! üòÅ
173,173,5,2018-10-12T16:14:25.000Z,HMB local,This app has changed the way and what I eat,"Great app. Began tracking my food because of poor lab results (high cholesterol, poor kidney function and some other things). After 4 months of tracking my food, adjusting and readjusting, my weight is down, my lab results are excellent and I‚Äôm definitely eating better. This app helped me make the lifestyle changes I needed to look and feel healthier."
174,174,5,2020-07-31T11:39:28.000Z,RoxtarDiva,Better than the ‚ÄúPal‚Äù,"This app has so many extra exercise and food choices than other apps I‚Äôve tried. I left a couple times and came back to this one for good. I don‚Äôt have a wearable tracker to connect to so I can‚Äôt comment on that, but tracking my food and exercise manually has worked for me. I always lose weight when I use this app to hold me accountable."
175,175,4,2020-08-22T10:11:29.000Z,Tampa WW,I like this APP- pros/cons list,I have been a lifelong MFP user but wanted to change things up. I‚Äôm only one week in with this app but here are my thoughts so far:
176,176,5,2021-05-27T11:33:39.000Z,jmrpax,Excellent  FREE app for tracking calories,I was looking for an app that would help me to track calories ( and wouldn‚Äôt start charging you after a free trial. This has been so helpful!
177,177,5,2020-12-03T16:25:04.000Z,Mama Haas,Only thing I don‚Äôt like is the app name,"This app is super user friendly! Love the barcode scanner. That and the whole app makes tracking really easy. Two things I‚Äôd change: the name, total daily count to reflect burned calories. I know you can see that on the monthly summary, and I can do math, BUT... it is just nice to see it reflected in a total number at a glance. Love everything else though."
178,178,4,2021-04-24T14:58:32.000Z,GregZisme,Kinda Cool!,"I think I saw an ad for the app on my Instagram feed, and as I was just starting a Keto plan, I thought I‚Äôd give it a try. I‚Äôm finding it fun, and a bit of a pain, to track my daily food intake, but after figuring out how to set up my recurring meal items it‚Äôs becoming second nature to keep up with inputting the info. It seems to have a really deep data base on store brand and restaurant foods. So far, I‚Äôm liking it - and I‚Äôm down 6 pounds in two weeks! üëçüèªüëçüèª"
179,179,5,2020-08-22T23:40:36.000Z,Bill Pratt in DC,Happy user since 2012,I use FatSecret every single day for every single meal to stay on track with my calories and macros. The databases are very well-maintained and are crowd sourced so I can always add a new food and if I need to. The community is helpful and fun. And then I‚Äôve made lots of friends that I‚Äôve known for years. FatSecret is the key to my success in losing over 100 pounds and keeping it off for this long.
180,180,4,2018-01-23T20:00:44.000Z,KingDD3,Great Tool,Great Tool for counting calories and keeping track of a diet. Tons of preprogrammed options and scannable items make it really easy to record what you‚Äôre consuming and help you loose weight if that‚Äôs your goal. 2 things it needs to do better are 1) Allow a better way to add products that aren‚Äôt recognized and then have them be scannable at a later date. 2) Better security and encryption for accounts and the mobile app.
181,181,3,2018-08-06T16:19:08.000Z,danisaywhaa,Great app but could be better!,I was recommended this app for its food database by a friend who used it. And now I see why-the recipes are great! Although I wish there was a way to save the recipes outside of the food diary. I love looking through the recipes for ideas but I can never save them and not count it as a meal for the day.
182,182,5,2018-12-31T15:07:25.000Z,CosasOnTheRun,Great app to keep track of calories,Easy to use and keep a log of the food you eat. Most of the information for food is already on file and if not you can easily enter it. I like the display of all the information and how fast you can navigate from one screen to another. Definitely recommend it if you want to achieve your goals.
183,183,5,2019-04-04T04:47:39.000Z,AbuAlbara_alsilwadi,Excellent app,I love using this app. Logging in your food intake is really easy with the huge database and the feature of adding new foods that aren‚Äôt on the list. I wish that you could add more meals per day and not only stick with 4 meals where I‚Äôd have to log my multiple meals on the same meal type. Would be nice to have the option of adding as many meals per day as possible.
184,184,4,2019-04-21T22:35:54.000Z,Zxbsjsndnsk,Great app,Very great app!! Love it.
185,185,5,2019-08-05T09:46:54.000Z,Retired Space Food Junkie,FatSecret works for me,This app has help me reduce my weight without exercising.  I eat things I like and fast 16 hours a day.  Eat an early dinner and late breakfast.  Track sugars and carbs by keeping them within recommended range and give your body a chance to process the food naturally. The app also lets me plan ahead by checking calories of foods I buy at the grocery store and restaurants.  It is a well planned app.
186,186,5,2020-12-12T13:12:03.000Z,Abbey Babbey,Easy and efficient,"Have used a few calorie/macro/weight tracking apps, this one is by far the easiest I have used. It‚Äôs no fuss and I like the alerts as they are just enough and not annoying. Has made it easier to track my protein intake and monitor my weight. I don‚Äôt use all of the features but what I do use definitely meets my needs. Highly recommend!"
187,187,5,2021-04-16T17:01:38.000Z,Silver Streak 1,Great App. Love it. One Addition would make it better.,The app is great. Things I previously stated has been taken care of.

I installed it on my iPhone, iPad and Windows PC. I see everything across all platforms. The program finds just about every food I eat. I‚Äôve lost 25 pounds in just over a month. I‚Äôve also paired it with the Health app on my iPhone. It‚Äôs just a fantastic App."
189,189,4,2020-10-02T02:06:53.000Z,VSWC,Very Good & none are perfect,"Has pretty many entries and you can enter your own recipes, save meals, etc.  You can customize the macros you track (i.e. net carbs, sugar, etc.)"

There are tons of foods already in their data base and you can scan product bar codes to get nutritional data. You have a choice of what to tract, calories, carbs, net carbs, etc. The net carbs may run a little high but everything else seems accurate."

194,194,4,2021-03-13T01:00:50.000Z,supersayanyoda2,Great app withe wide food catalog,Love the app so far has most things i would want. I wish you could track workouts on it and that you could search food on apple watch. Also kinda annoying that to find the net calories (food - activity) you have to go to a diet calendar instead of being part of the summary. Besides those negatives i like the ui and the food catalog is vast. Also its great that it integrates with apple health.
195,195,4,2020-08-14T15:38:31.000Z,12dilly34fox,Fat secret helper bee,"This app makes tracking calories, weight and macronutrients Easy. It offers some great recipes for specific diets at your fingertips . What could be better: actually finding the food I eat most frequently. It has a category for recent food but isn‚Äôt accurate. It uses a lot of brands which is actually helpful unless you cook from scratch, which I do. Then I usually choose a food closest to what I made."

197,197,5,2019-06-25T19:28:03.000Z,Kaleenka,Better than the rest but need a couple tweaks and Fitbit integration.,I‚Äôve tried them all but have learned more using FatSecret. The amount of data available and the myriad ways it can be viewed/chunked out is incredibly useful. Good looking. Fast. Only a couple things need addressed:

I enjoy logging all my daily meals, exercises and talking with others. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! You can set your caloric goals, weight goals and count calories daily. I enjoy keeping track of my sugars, proteins and sodium counts. You have the flexibility of changing it based on your needs. MUST HAVE!"
200,200,4,2018-07-28T23:04:33.000Z,Reanm8or,Drawbacks?,"I like this app but if I had to change a few minor things I would.   It‚Äôd be nice to have a copy/paste functionality (or maybe I‚Äôm just missing it?) and what‚Äôd be really nice is if you had a ‚Äúdrink‚Äù section that tallied up your beverage count as well.  I also think it‚Äôd be nice to have the option to automatically scroll to the next or previous day if desired, vice using the calendar every time."

It helps to categorize calories based on prescribed meal input, and you change the calorie count based on the size/quantity of the meal.  It also integrates physical activities to show meals compared to activities.  And it‚Äôs simple for the price (free!)."

207,207,4,2019-07-15T13:21:49.000Z,AuntRainey,Fabulous,"I‚Äôd give it a 5 but adding food can be a pain and the calories on the camera results are often wrong and I couldn‚Äôt find any way to edit them. Not a great deal off - just maybe 10 calories or so, but still ... Adding a brand new food can be more steps than I‚Äôd like - Probably because I‚Äôm on my iPhone - but I wouldn‚Äôt be staying on my diet without it so I‚Äôm grateful it‚Äôs here and it really is incredibly useful."
208,208,5,2020-06-05T14:15:11.000Z,jevxz,The help your looking for,"Fat Secret is a life saver! Learn to eat nutritious foods, by looking at the reports they give you. Eat the required calories and you will loose! They figure your calorie intake by your age, activity level, & gender. I had to recalculate my activity level down to sedentary to start loosing. It‚Äôs melting off. I also started drinking lemon water 32 oz. a day. Put the peeled lemon in the glass! Even my dietician loves it."
209,209,5,2020-02-15T16:22:45.000Z,Nononsense4,Excellent food tracker,"I‚Äôm using fat secret to help me cut down on the carbs and boost my protein. The app breaks it all down for me and I can track my weight too. The food label scanner works like magic, pulling in food data in seconds. Very thoughtfully designed, feature rich, I love it! You can‚Äôt fix what you can‚Äôt measure - this app keeps me on track and has been eye opening!"
210,210,5,2018-02-11T11:41:52.000Z,Skeeling83,Great help in weight loss!,"I've tried a lot of things in the last five months to help me lose about 25 pounds. Nothing was working at all! I started using this App on January 27th... It is now February 11th and I have lost 7.4 pounds so far. Two weeks and a day. Don't get me wrong, I had a couple cheat days here and there. If you put the effort in, you can do it with the help of this app."
211,211,5,2018-03-31T04:57:53.000Z,_michaelsgirrrrrrl,Down 16 lbs!,"I couldn‚Äôt imagine my day to day life without this app! Having a strict 1200 cal daily intake has been so easy to track using this every single time I eat anything! Looooove it! And love that I can track my weight and see how much progress I‚Äôve made! So much better and more user friendly than the most recommended calorie tracker, myfitnesspal. Love love love this one!"
212,212,5,2018-05-30T16:14:55.000Z,oreams,FatSecret,Great easy informative love it learning a lot and I recognize where I need to adjust my eating habits. Tracking helps to pass up extra snacks. Being able to eat a variety and the same foods as the family makes it better. Checking to see if l need the full serving or if I‚Äôm satisfied with less makes a difference with tracking. Thanks
213,213,5,2019-06-06T13:43:33.000Z,Marylooooo,This app is awesome,"I was using another app that was very popular and it virtually had no features unless you upgraded and paid a weekly fee ‚Äì ‚Äì it was ridiculous. With this app I‚Äôve already lost 16 pounds. It‚Äôs easy to use and I‚Äôm not being hassled every five minutes to give them money. I highly recommend this app for anybody who wants to lose, maintain, or gain."
214,214,5,2021-02-09T16:50:55.000Z,DavidCorbly,This Should Be a Fully Paid App,"I‚Äôve been using FatSecret for years to help maintain a healthy weight and monitor my intake of proteins, fats, carbs, sugars and salts. I log *everything*! Can‚Äôt imagine not having this app. So far the paid version doesn‚Äôt haven features I need, but if the company ever decided to change to a fully-paid model at a reasonable price, I‚Äôd be up for that."
215,215,5,2020-12-15T11:56:58.000Z,jcjunky4ever,Awesome Support,"Fat Secret helps to manage and log your input and output, but the best part is the comradery between you and the other members. When you lose a pound or gain one, people are there to encourage and support you. It‚Äôs great to see other people‚Äôs success stories and learn from them as well. Not to mention the wonderful recipe ideas you gather from the site as well."
216,216,5,2020-08-22T02:39:08.000Z,Afro Mama,Life changing!,"I love this app! So easy to use, and no annoying ads popping up all the time like in other calorie tracker apps. I love that it tracks calories and macros. I‚Äôve lost 7 pounds so far this month, tracking my calories and macros on this app, plus using the Peloton app daily. I feel very in charge and empowered in my weight loss journey using these two apps."
217,217,5,2020-04-23T13:58:01.000Z,MB066,Fatsecret app,"A terrific app to assist me in staying disciplined and make better choices. I preload what I intend to eat and can make a choice whether to increase, decrease, add something or subtract an item(s). No more guess work or rationalizing. I can see that a handful if chocolate and an extra glass of wine at night before bed is 500 cal. That knowledge helps me realize the benefit in the moment is simply not worth it!"
218,218,5,2021-07-03T18:58:20.000Z,klaus0000001,Review of FatSecret,Awesome app. Perfect for tracking macros and (some) nutrients. It has pretty much everything I eat and from there all you need to do is know the serving. It helps me see how my body reacts to certain calorie surpluses and helped me gain muscle without fat. It shows you your macro split(super helpful) so you are aware of where your calories are coming from. All of that for free.
219,219,5,2021-05-20T22:46:17.000Z,ez pzy,EASY PEAZY,"Finally found an easy nutrition tracker or rather another one, other one was discontinued. This one is easy to use, very little navigation required. Has lots of food brands to choose from. Laid out nicely and flows from one content to another."
220,220,5,2018-02-06T10:51:52.000Z,Alfisch,A great tool - And getting better all the time.,"I have use this weight-loss tracking program for several years now and I am very impressed as of late with how user-friendly it has gotten. It‚Äôs easy to find your food, select, adjust the amounts and save meals that you eat frequently. I find when I‚Äôm not using it is when I gain."
221,221,3,2018-08-01T17:53:33.000Z,MAMAMIADREA,Best kept secret,I like that I can sync my information with my health app on my iPhone. I like being able to keep track of what I eat and drink and my EXERCISE and I‚Äôm able to use it with my registered dietitian in the program I am in. I just learned that a friend of mine uses the app as well and that‚Äôs the one thing I can‚Äôt see on the app on my phone is how to search for other friends. Am I missing it? How do I do that? Otherwise very functional and a very useful tool.
222,222,5,2018-08-15T12:39:16.000Z,Sonya Wolf,Simple and fast,"The easiest app out there that I‚Äôve food to maintain a food diary. It has a massive library of foods already stored in its database, but if what you‚Äôre eating isn‚Äôt in there, it‚Äôs fairly easy to add it in. The great part about that is that once it‚Äôs in there, it stays in there, so that it‚Äôs easier for you to search for that item again in the future."
223,223,4,2018-10-29T19:15:57.000Z,BeDord,Recipe building not easy,"I like everything about Fat Secret except when building recipes, there aren‚Äôt bigger and smaller measurements to pick, so for instant on spices, there might not be tablespoon to pick or for canned foods you have to put in grams instead of ounces, for pounds of meat you have to pick 3 or 4 ounces times 3 or 4 instead of having pound as a measurement to pick or I had to pick 1/2 of 1/4 for smaller amounts of spices. Very frustrating."
224,224,5,2019-03-21T17:22:40.000Z,Bens& Danielle,Great App,I‚Äôve been using Fat Secret for about six years. It‚Äôs great for tracking my calories with their large and accurate database of foods. It‚Äôs also easy to add any new foods items that are not in the database. The app also connects to my Apple Watch to factor in how many calories I‚Äôve burned throughout the day. Fat Secret makes tracking my health easy and convenient.
225,225,5,2020-08-20T13:22:49.000Z,Kate new name,"Easy to use, huge list of foods, easy to add your own","It‚Äôs a good straightforward app, with chat and following options if you want community on your way. I‚Äôd ask to add option to copy foods from previous days and insert in current day, and maybe to star foods to curate list of my favorites myself. All the rest is fine, convenient and easy"
226,226,4,2021-04-01T14:30:42.000Z,ktjjjj4,Fat Secret,"Haven‚Äôt really tried anything like this before now but have used it for about 3 months.  Really helps me keep track of calories, carbs, protein and fat.  The exercise portion doesn‚Äôt match my stationary cycle ... always gives me 3x what my bike says I burned.  I just adjust it by decreasing my minutes til it is close to actual calories burned.  I intend to keep using it unless something better comes along!"
227,227,5,2021-08-18T00:26:25.000Z,egrohd,Free and easy to use!,"I was paying for Noom but I like this app even more, and it‚Äôs free! I haven‚Äôt used any paid options. I like the social aspect ‚Äî it‚Äôs like old old Facebook in style, which I find comforting and amazing. Everyone is supportive and posts interesting and honest updates. And the calorie and macro counter seems to be accurate and reliable."
228,228,5,2021-03-06T13:13:49.000Z,Unhappy(number2),Fairly easy to use and counts calories,"If you do what you are supposed to, soon, you will be losing weight. Very good tracker that seems to have all the foods and their nutritional info or at least close enough. The more you use it the easier it is to use."

230,230,4,2017-10-12T14:27:41.000Z,SoFloSoFawny,This App is the Key!,"This app is the key to mindful eating.  I've been using the app for two months and I love that I've reduced my caloric intake AND my BELLY FAT! The easy to use app has forced me to look at meal content, regulate portion control & stop over-eating. I have not changed anything else. The only drawback is there are no instructions and no help menu so you need to figure out input yourself. How do you correct a wrong input date?"
231,231,5,2018-03-06T02:42:28.000Z,mprentice,Awesome app! Well organized and easy to use,"I‚Äôve been using a well known competitor to this app and I have to say, I‚Äôm super impressed and decided to cancel my subscription to the other app. This one gives me everything I need. It‚Äôs very easy to use, well laid out, and intuitive. Everything is right where you would expect it. Love this app!"
232,232,5,2019-02-12T20:08:28.000Z,Rsvcp2,The best app that is free for tracking all your macronutrients,Incredible app ! I use to have a my fitness pal subscription to track all my macros but I had to find ways to save money and so decided to opt for an app that offers what myfitnesspal offers for a discounted price or even better free! So when I stumbled upon FatSecret I got hooked immediately ! Try it out !
233,233,5,2020-05-20T11:51:59.000Z,Chappy3469,Comprehensive and easy to use,I used FatSecret several years ago and lost 50 pounds. I‚Äôve gained it back. I tried everything to loose this weight but realized I need to use the app again. Today‚Äôs app is a mature app greatly improved with easy to use features that are awesome. Especially the ability to scan barcodes. Thanks !
234,234,5,2020-03-21T16:38:39.000Z,lightingwolf66,Amazing app.,I love this app it‚Äôs helping me feel so much better than I ever was before. It helps me physically and mentally relax just by working out and counting your daily calories. It will help you lose weight and feel better again. I highly recommend it if you‚Äôre wanting to take charge and feel better again.
235,235,5,2019-07-17T13:23:28.000Z,Blessed at 54,Fat Secret,"I LOVE the Fat Secret!!!! It is soooo easy to use and allows me to keep a record of my macros!  I love that I can record foods from other countries as I sometimes use British products. I also love how it records my weight loss journey! Lastly, the Reports feature provides helpful and comprehensive information for my nutritionist. It really shows the real picture of what I have eaten. GO FAT SECRET!!!!"
236,236,5,2021-05-08T12:34:07.000Z,Cindy in cornfields,What would I do?,I use this APP at every meal. It helps me count my carbs and fat. My doctor told me how many carbs to eat to stay away from taking diabetes insulin. So far so good! I‚Äôm going on 8 years since I found I was diabetic and this APP has really helped me stay on track!!!!
237,237,5,2020-01-11T10:24:00.000Z,MissChunky217,From 2014 s desktop to Apple app,It‚Äôs amazing I thought I lost this site because it wasn‚Äôt an app when I originally started using it in 2012 nor did it have this much details. I‚Äôm excited and so happy that I am able to adjust and pick up where I am now and document and with the newer details I can track
238,238,5,2021-07-18T13:25:59.000Z,sue whid-mart,Great food tracker,"Very simple, I love the scan bar feature for adding foods to my meal time. I also love checking the graphs at the end of the week or during my day to see how my progress goes. I also paid extra for water chart. Easy to add new foods and find all most everything I eat or drink on their food list."
239,239,4,2021-03-27T12:41:33.000Z,Think Healthy,Good app,"This a good app to log calories and see how much your daily food intake distributes across fat, carbs, and protein. It‚Äôs assisting in making better food choices. I wish it would break out saturated fat, sodium, and sugar on the summary page. If you want to get a meal plan then it costs but, overall, I think it‚Äôs a good app. Better than many others I have tried including weight watchers and noom."
240,240,5,2018-01-07T16:20:15.000Z,InnerLandscape,Review of FatSecret,"I find it a great app that does not intrude with unnecessary ads or gimmicks, and instead provides me with exactly what I want in terms of finding food, keeping track of calories, and weight goals. Haven't really used the home/community aspect of it, but at a glance it looks to be a nice simple way to discover new recipes and other various things."
241,241,1,2018-03-13T18:49:27.000Z,rachebodcrane,Wow! Truly awful,I downloaded the app and tried to calculate my suggested amount of daily calories and the app said that my weight is too low to suggest an RDI! How is that even a reason? I‚Äôve had my rdi calculated by tons of other apps so obviously it‚Äôs possible. It made me feel so awful I immediately deleted the app and won‚Äôt be using it. I‚Äôve struggled with my weight my whole life and I‚Äôm underweight right now due to health issues. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone with health issues or an eating disorder being able to use this. Honestly disgusted that the devs wrote that message in the app.
242,242,5,2018-04-09T17:32:55.000Z,KStroble,Best app to helping you achieve your goals!,"I been using this application for many many years and it‚Äôs just keeps getting easier and better!

243,243,5,2018-04-29T03:12:33.000Z,Khandle,Great app,"Had a difficult time a finding a free app that would allow me to enter carbs or calories. This one is super allowing me to choose from brand names, create my own menus. Keeps record of weight. Perfect! It will also change the serving size if you need to that. Hope the developers leave this app alone. I t meets all my needsüòΩ"
244,244,5,2018-10-11T22:50:55.000Z,mmomrulzc,The best!,"This site is easy to use. I can figure out a whole day of calories. It also tells me how many I've used. This also breaks down carbs, fats and protein. I like the weight loss chart. It keeps track of my progress and let's me know how many I have till goal. I've been using this for a year and I don't go a day without it."
245,245,5,2020-06-26T06:13:36.000Z,coolQTpie,The best calorie tracker,"I have tried many, many calorie trackers and this is by far the best! It is simple and easy to use. This app shows the breakdown of carbs, fat, and protein. I am writing this review because I am pleasantly surprised at how nice and easy it is to use. I can finally make my weight loss goals because I found a tracker that I can stick with."
246,246,5,2019-08-14T13:42:16.000Z,arrogantcompany,Great calorie finder,This app keeps me honest and on track if I remember to put in all of my snacks. The quantity part is easy to adjust and the app has comparable items if yours are not listed just read the labels on your foods and then you will know how many calories to put in. I am losing about 2 lbs per week. Only used app for 4 weeks but I love it !
247,247,5,2020-10-12T14:14:26.000Z,uuyririydj,Very useful,"I started using the app two weeks ago and find it very useful for tracking consumption and weight. It is very comprehensive and contains a data base of foods that has proven very valuable. It is easy to use and allows one to keep to a calorie controlled diet with ease. So far, I have lost 8 lb in 2 weeks without feeling deprived of food."
248,248,4,2021-04-19T16:54:11.000Z,Foruab,Fat Secret,"This has been a excellent way to lose weight.  I have never counted calories before. I know ahead of eating what I am putting into my body and chose the right number of calories to get through each meal so I can have calories left over for my snacks.  Being a diabetic II, I have to eat a certain amount of carbs but not to many.  My Doctor is going to love my A1C this next visit."
249,249,5,2020-07-05T09:16:40.000Z,Joanny P,Rating Fat Secret,I‚Äôve been using this app for a couple of weeks now and I‚Äôm really enjoying being able to track what I eat. My overall goal is to lose 30lbs in 10lbs increments. Love that it converts the food I eat into calories consumed. Although I did find the app challenging at first I persevered with it and I‚Äôm now comfortable with it.
250,250,4,2018-01-28T15:47:19.000Z,Kathy Dee,Fat secret,"I‚Äôm just learning my way around the app, but I‚Äôm impressed with the wide variety of foods in the food library. I can almost always find the exact food, right down to the brand I use! This makes it much less of a chore to track what I‚Äôm eating. I am able to easily keep tabs on my carb, protein and fat intake each day. So far it has helped me stick to my ‚Äúreal food‚Äù diet and drop pounds!"
251,251,5,2018-05-03T18:20:21.000Z,Lil_faust3,Love this app!,It‚Äôs so easy to keep track of how much you eat with this app. It‚Äôs easy to over eat and not know the calorie intake of things and this app helps tame the amount you eat. I like creating recipes and I‚Äôll use this app to see how many calories are in what I made. Just because I make something healthy doesn‚Äôt mean it calorie free.
252,252,5,2018-05-24T14:37:56.000Z,Timnlisa,Luv Fat Secret,"I‚Äôve tried other calorie tracking apps, but Fat Secret has every feature I could want. It‚Äôs very easy to use, and I haven‚Äôt found a food yet that wasn‚Äôt in their library. Perhaps the best feature is that it automatically syncs to My Fitbit, making tracking my exercise and calorie expenditure so much easier."
253,253,5,2018-08-24T11:35:55.000Z,Guiltypuzzler,Streamlined and effective,"I‚Äôve used several apps like this, including My Fitness Pal, but found them all a little cumbersome. FatSecret (despite the awful name!) lets you keep track of your nutrition and exercise easily, without piling on a bunch of features that I personally just found distracting. I also love the journaling function!"
254,254,4,2018-10-29T14:29:11.000Z,SProwett,The App is great and the developers are semi-responsive,"The community of other dieters on their boards are wonderfully supportive as well. But there really needs to be a mechanism to make verifying nutrition information data in their database or reporting inaccurate entries possible. Vendors do put out new products with slightly different information, but sometimes there are just plain data entry errors."
255,255,5,2021-03-17T10:11:31.000Z,Moscow Expat,Outstanding,"I have lost 6 lbs (2.7kg) in 17 days while eating healthy, balanced and filling meals 3x day (plus a snack), not even following a diet plan, just common sense (few or no prepared foods; lots of veggies; chicken and fish; minimizing saturated fats).  85% of losing weight is burning more calories than you consume. This app makes it very easy to count consumption and to make healthy substitutes as necessary."
256,256,5,2020-02-23T13:54:59.000Z,RhiannonBowers,Everything I need,"This app does everything I need it to do without trying to sell me something every 5 minutes.

257,257,5,2021-04-29T18:19:21.000Z,Irina_Seattle,Enjoying FatSecret,"I decided to give it a try. I just wanted my calories and macros look if I start eating with wise choices in mind. I like that you gave food database , receipted, cook book.  Also I like being able to make your meals‚Äô photos. Great addition - you can log your exercises to  check you calories balance:)."
258,258,5,2020-12-29T11:44:54.000Z,150-149-148-147...,It‚Äôs working!,It makes me happy to achieve my goal of staying at or under the amount of food I should have each day. It‚Äôs enlightening to see how much I love food with fat and carbs!! (I‚Äôm working on that...) I‚Äôm right on track with one pound loss per week and feel so much better. I even lost my pound after pigging out on Christmas Day. Yay!
259,259,4,2021-03-05T13:52:23.000Z,Brokerb,Love this app,"I‚Äôve been using FS app for many years now.  It has a great food search and even if it doesn‚Äôt locate the food you ate, simply take a picture of the barecode and it will populate."

It took me a week to get proficient and now I‚Äôm loving how this allows me to be so much more aware of what I‚Äôm eating and fitting in the pieces like a fun game of Tetris every day. I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised with the comprehensive database of foods that makes the whole process easier than I thought.
263,263,4,2019-12-09T15:34:08.000Z,Pannnizzz,Way easier calories tracking,It makes it really easy to track all the calories you use during the day just by taking a photo or entering the name of the product you used you easily can calculate and keep a diary on what you ate how much calories you use How much weight you lost your goal and ...
264,264,5,2021-03-31T16:34:43.000Z,Gymnastics_liz1,"Simple, to the point",What makes this site great is that it allows you to be as straightforward As possible. All I want is to log calories and see how much of a nutrient I'm lacking. No social stuff. I have everything I need here to be successful and I LOVE that it does not add back my workout calories when I log exercise!
265,265,5,2021-02-23T17:33:58.000Z,irish ei,Getting fit in my 50‚Äôs,This app has been very easy and addicting to use. This is my first time at calorie counting when dieting and I find it extremely helpful when making the proper choices that keep me satisfied. So far so good...two weeks in and 6lbs down with roughly another 10 to go.

268,268,4,2021-02-04T02:02:18.000Z,dlackie2788,Good app,"I like this app a lot, but had a hard time figuring it out. If you skip the start up, there‚Äôs no way, (that I could find), how to go back and find out how to maneuver through the app. Once I figured it out, it was easy. I really like how you can put in any food or drink in and it‚Äôll tell you how many calories everything is. Also, how much fat, protein, etc."
269,269,5,2019-08-06T13:04:45.000Z,Brooklyn Boomer,Flexible and Adaptable,"Visual cues, data rich and well laid out interface gives simplicity to weight management.  Gave 5 stars as will probably migrate to Pro version as believe if a more refined food search is available and if not, given their level of details found in the free version, this upgrade will be added."
270,270,4,2017-10-25T18:25:11.000Z,CBowse,Love! But one suggestion.,Edit: since the iOS 11 update I haven‚Äôt been able to sync my Fitbit with FS :(
271,271,5,2018-01-28T06:19:41.000Z,mariekhaze,Easy to use,Love this app. It‚Äôs he easiest calorie counter by far. I just type a few words in and they have everything from fast food to items I can buy in most grocery stores.
272,272,4,2018-02-14T19:50:47.000Z,Jentera,Great!,"This is a great simple calorie counter with NO ADS and you don‚Äôt have to upgrade. The one thing that would be cool is if it took into account automatically...how many steps you took in a day. In other words, if you walked 15,000 steps one day, you should have a higher caloric allowance for that day. The app sees the steps that your phone registers but it‚Äôd be cool if it automatically adjusted the calorie allowance."
273,273,5,2018-03-08T03:15:42.000Z,charley's best friend,Great App!,Its food listings by brand and specific type (for example Epic protein bars and nuts by brand) make it so easy to keep my food diary and know exactly what I am eating each day.  And the detailed reports are amazing.  I also like the social media part of the app where you can interact with other people who are on a similar journey.  Fantastic app!  I love it!
274,274,5,2018-07-18T00:24:14.000Z,OhheyitsJen1414,FatSecret: 5 Stars :),"No ads, no in app purchases, and it‚Äôs free."
275,275,5,2018-09-27T01:51:06.000Z,Mike & Lucy,Well thoughtful software,I am loving this software. It has good reports and great list of foods and meals. Plus a great list of restaurant foods.  It breaks down each item to macro nutrients which allows me to see what I am consuming. When comparing a few days of meals the macro listing is really eye opening.
276,276,5,2018-10-11T02:33:48.000Z,Ycam20012,Great App,"Love this app. Easy to use with an endless data base of food from your favorite restaurants to the lowliest snack you can think of. Punch it in, or search it, fat secret will tell you what the content of the food in an instant. Lost 67 pounds using this app to make my meals. I gained all but 10 of it back. I‚Äôm back at and have lost 15 pounds so far. Great app!!"
277,277,5,2019-01-07T16:58:15.000Z,LANoCaGal,Great Tool,Simple formula calories in and calories out. Tool allows you to track your intake through a large library of food selections.  It can link to exercise devices to track your output. As with any tool you have to use and it is only good as the input. Be honest; you will see results and behavior changes.
278,278,5,2021-08-09T14:05:40.000Z,Kateller,Great app,Love this app for recording food. I can take a picture of the barcode of the product and it gives me the calories and details. I also save meals that I eat frequently so that saves me time.
279,279,5,2020-06-01T11:58:00.000Z,Suezzzzzzzzzzzzz,Best app!,"I use this app constantly to plan my meals and track calories as well as carbs, fats, and proteins.  I weigh my food, so I appreciate that the app allows me to enter most foods based upon weight, rather than just the number of servings.  I have lost and maintained my weight and general health primarily through the dedicated daily use of this app."
280,280,5,2017-11-13T20:19:00.000Z,Pitboy7,So easy!!,This app has allowed me to lose weight and track every single thing I am eating. You don‚Äôt realize what you‚Äôre eating and less you‚Äôre tracking and this makes it so easy! It allows you to put in your weight track your weight your food at your exercise it‚Äôs awesome!
281,281,4,2017-11-26T06:15:35.000Z,EnjoyingtheWeeklyPicks,Pretty Cool App,I enjoy using this app. I like to see how the calories change if fat is added or not. There is a nice selection of foods already listed. It is helpful to monitor my energy as well (how what I eat makes me feel at different parts of the day). At first I thought that I was obsessed with tracking calories - but this app truly has helped me develop of lifestyle of healthy living.
282,282,4,2018-09-17T21:15:32.000Z,Mandy's MacBook Pro,Help button needed now,I need to share my tracking info with my doctor. When I went to use the share feature I noticed my email address had a typo in it. When I go to account settings there is no way to edit the address and no help button to help me change it. I need to share this info in the next 24 hours. Any help?
283,283,4,2019-01-09T11:39:57.000Z,CoolieGirl79,Great App,"I‚Äôve been using this app for a few years and it‚Äôs improved so much. I like the vast selection of food in their database and the fact you can scan food barcode. It tracks exercise as well and breaks down your food by carbs, fat, sugar etc if you‚Äôre doing Keto and it‚Äôs free! There is a subscription for more features but I‚Äôve been doing great with the free option!"
284,284,5,2021-04-09T20:30:02.000Z,skipster456,Easy to use!,"Love being able to create my own recipes. Improvements needed: to able to enter exact ounces instead of spinning the dial and choosing from a predetermined number. I have to use the website for those entries, with no camera ability for scanning. Still great!!"
285,285,4,2021-06-08T13:16:30.000Z,Mmmc129,Great way to be aware,I use the app to track my food intake and exercise each day. I feel it keeps me honest and also allows me to provide to my doctor a true list of what I‚Äôve done to eat healthier and exercise. This app has helped me lose 12 pounds in a little over two months. I‚Äôm hoping for another 12 pounds over the next three months!
286,286,5,2021-03-06T10:26:27.000Z,Cute Gargoyle,So easy to use,"After setting up the app and learning how to use it, everything becomes so simple to do. It isn‚Äôt a large burden on your time to enter all the information and it displays the relevant information back to you in a clear, easy to read way."
287,287,5,2019-09-10T04:23:01.000Z,Minnesota Mad Man,Love this... for many years now,This is the most straight forward meal tracker. I‚Äôve used a bunch over the years and I keep coming back. True story: when I lost 28 lbs in five months... I used this app. Went Keto ish. Lots of walking. Gym 3-4 days/ week. Then I stopped and gained 10 back. I am serious again. Fat Secret keeps me on track.
288,288,5,2019-06-28T15:46:32.000Z,leinma2,Easy to use!,This app has so easy to use!
289,289,5,2021-02-19T12:14:58.000Z,Irish Pretzel,Best free app for diet and weight loss,"For FREE I am able to track weight, share my journey with my trainer and Dietition through automated emails. Syncs to my Apple Watch. Works especially well with low carb diets because it tracks net carbs as well as macro %.  Only app I‚Äôll ever use. Syncs seamlessly between watch, phone and desktop version. I lost 180 pounds thanks to FatSecret."
290,290,5,2018-03-13T01:46:46.000Z,Bigsquish2grace,For the first time Fat (secret) is my friend!,"I love this app. Super user friendly way to track your food and see fats, carbs and protein at a glance. Has great resources to look up foods and their nutritional values. Tons of restaurants listed too. Also a journal you can use if so inclined and there‚Äôs a very supportive community as well. One of the best perks is it‚Äôs FREE! I highly recommend FS."
291,291,5,2018-05-23T11:09:50.000Z,JWLoper63,"If used right, can change your lifestyle",The app is useful in keeping track of your daily intake. The key is to be diligent and be honest. Suggest you get a digital kitchen scale (measure in both grams and ounces) to be most efficient. Very impressed with the huge assortment of food options loaded in; makes things easier.
292,292,5,2018-06-23T22:22:07.000Z,Sternmaniac,Best App I‚Äôve ever downloaded,This app is life changing! The ability to monitor everything I eat has made me healthier. I‚Äôm trying to eat Keto and it wouldn‚Äôt be possible without this app. It‚Äôs amazing! I used it no less than 15 times a day to record something or read about others and their stories.
293,293,4,2018-07-02T23:53:50.000Z,Yoboyobo6,Really like this app,"I have really enjoyed this app!  I like the ease of recording what I eat, the community interaction, the recipe sharing and the available challenges. I do wish it had a guideline for how many calories I should be taking in to lose weight. If I just haven‚Äôt seen it I would feel bad because I would have given it 5 stars instead of 4."
294,294,5,2018-07-03T00:29:06.000Z,LAVNDA,fatsecret vs myplate,After over six months of tracking on myplate I lost all my data and had to start over. I jumped the myplate ship. It took a little getting used to but there is simply more to this app and tracking is great! More food selections show up on the app and adding a food is so much easier. Thanks fatsecret!
295,295,5,2018-07-05T08:24:17.000Z,GrandTina,Fat Secret,"Fat Secret keeps me on track. I put in the food I eat and it tracks calories, etc for me."
296,296,5,2018-11-25T15:41:19.000Z,NygelLazuline,I love it,"I know is a bit obnoxious to have a food diary, but since I have the app in this last two months I have keep dropping pounds along with KETO and exercise."
297,297,5,2020-12-18T10:46:55.000Z,Farmlabs,I‚Äôve been hoping for this,"I haven‚Äôt been able to find an easy place to find the calorie content for basic ingredients.  This has them and makes it easy to chronicle the amounts eaten.  For those that have mostly pre-prepared frozen, canned, or boxed items, they‚Äôre in here too."
298,298,5,2020-03-24T18:23:37.000Z,GatorGary,Very good free app that is fully functional,The free app is very functional and worth looking at for your food tracking needs. The preloaded restaurants and brands is a great time saver. For stuff you can‚Äôt find the exact match you can usually find a substitute or add your own. It caches recently eaten and most eaten which is a great time saver.
299,299,5,2019-07-26T13:45:20.000Z,INFP_Hufflepuff,A lot more user friendly than My Fitness Pal,"I prefer this app over My Fitness Pal. It‚Äôs very straight forward and way less buggy than MFP. The discussion boards are a lot more congenial as well- A much more welcoming community. If you‚Äôre going to actively use a calorie counter & want the best experience, choose this one."
300,300,5,2017-09-25T03:22:09.000Z,coachmamz,Tons of foods to choose from,I am really liking this app. While I think the macro calculator was off a bit the functionality of this app is awesome. Almost every food I have eaten has already been in the library making it especially easy to log foods and stick closely to my numbers
301,301,3,2018-01-23T12:17:14.000Z,Jojobr,This app is so helpful for those on Keto,"After months of using MFP and complaining about it not giving their users the option to track net carbs, someone finally told me about Fatsecret. Once I tried it, I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased. Sure, the UI and UX need some work, and when you try to submit your own recipes they disappear into the void, but right now it is better than the alternative. At least for me."
302,302,5,2018-07-11T12:46:33.000Z,Dickster64,Best App for Weight Control,"I have used a lot of weight control apps and find this to be the most comprehensive of all. Easy to use, informative and current in it‚Äôs information. Some apps have an initial program that is never updated. This one is always current and spot on."
303,303,5,2019-03-22T14:24:24.000Z,Julie from Kentucky,FatSecret is the only way I stay on task!,"As long as I stay on FatSecret and chart the food I eat I lose weight. The supporters are kind, respectful and helpful no matter man, woman, young, old, trying to lose or trying to gain. The bodybuilders have been the kindest to me and I am a 69 year old female! I have recommended to all who talk blood results at my age."
304,304,5,2019-11-26T22:23:24.000Z,Sall223,Wonderful!!,"I began a keto lifestyle shortly after finding this app and it has been a godsend.  There is every food you can think of, listed here.  Keeps track of carbs and fats, along with your weight.  I had many different apps downloaded and have deleted all of them except this one.  Great job!!"
305,305,4,2020-10-02T21:41:23.000Z,Smckeen,Great way to monitor carbohydrate consumption.,"I‚Äôve been a type 1 diabetic for 51 years.  Fat secret is a vehicle that allows me to get fairly accurate carbohydrate numbers to maintain my insulin dosing.  The extensive database of food, and the ability to add items, is much better then just guessing, and after using for a while I can see the improvement in my numbers."
306,306,5,2019-07-12T02:22:25.000Z,mossdabossmossy,Awesome app,Personally I just don‚Äôt like the other apps even though they are very popular. With FatSecret I just have everything and want to go and the interface is very friendly. I really like how easy it is to use and also how it shows you visually how much you‚Äôre eating and your macros
307,307,4,2019-09-03T18:07:36.000Z,bparker86,Useful but inflexible with serving size,"I could not record ‚Äú2 tablespoons‚Äù of Oat bran. The only options are ‚Äúcup‚Äù or g. Okay, now I have to take out my calculator to do conversions."
308,308,5,2021-02-25T16:07:35.000Z,Chimdi,Super easy and intuitive without the clutter,"Love this app. I‚Äôve been using it for a long time. When MyFitnessPal sold its soul to the devil. I looked for an app that allowed me to track my weight and food. This app works great! If they had a paid version, I would gladly pay $20 to keep the ads away."
309,309,4,2021-05-30T07:40:29.000Z,9thsloth,Good App with some annoyances,This very well thought and designed app but I have few suggestions. Please consider fixing these and relieve me of my annoyances:
310,310,4,2018-03-31T16:03:14.000Z,Jimedcote14,FatSecret,"I like the app but wish it had a multi purpose calorie counter that I could use instead of trying to locate some foods because most of what I eat isn‚Äôt store prepared, and a choice of serving sizes is sometimes more different than ounces"
311,311,5,2018-07-11T13:28:52.000Z,Fire2all,FatSecret awesomeness,This is the most advanced app we have come across in tracking a food diary. The food search is the most comprehensive and identifies most large chain restaurants and tracery items. We‚Äôve been using it for about 2 years. You just have to commit to logging your food intake.
312,312,4,2018-09-13T11:45:45.000Z,Practically useless,Good app but inaccurate numbers,I really like the app but it needs improvements in two areas:
313,313,5,2021-02-05T12:54:20.000Z,one.day.at.a.time,Works for me!,I have used this app to track calories and progress for several years.  You can now track macro nutrients as well.  There are a lot of grocery and restaurant items listed in there and it is easy to put in lesser known recipes and ingredients to customize your app.
314,314,5,2021-01-24T16:08:14.000Z,jim e johnson,FatSecret,Love this app.... u don‚Äôt have to pay a million dollars like fitness pal and it‚Äôs just as robust... I‚Äôm an avid weightlifter and this allows me to keep close tabs on my Macros... A++ highly recommend this app for people who workout and watch a strict diet.. and even for people who don‚Äôt workout but are looking to closely monitor their macros/diet.
315,315,5,2020-09-05T14:02:51.000Z,Andi 1104,Great app!,This is a really great app for tracking calories and exercise. It has many items in the food database making it quick and easy to track items. I‚Äôve only used the free features but it offers menus for a fee which look interesting.
316,316,5,2019-12-03T14:30:28.000Z,Jimcaran,Great app!,I‚Äôve used this app for years and it‚Äôs a wonderful way to really keep track of your diet. It‚Äôs kept me accountable and it‚Äôs surprised me when I‚Äôve found out that a meal was way more calories than I thought. For people wanting to lose weight I think an app like this can be a great help.
317,317,5,2019-07-23T16:30:47.000Z,imnally,Great food tracker!,I absolutely love this nutrition app! The exercise portion is difficult and I don‚Äôt really feel that part is a hundred percent accurate. But logging food is super easy and I haven‚Äôt run into a food that isn‚Äôt already in the bank. I have no trouble monitoring my nutrition and tracking my weight goals.
318,318,4,2019-10-29T16:22:14.000Z,K9WTF,Almost perfect...,Easy to use and nicely feature packed.
319,319,4,2021-08-18T11:02:36.000Z,DaAudiGuy,Really helpful app,"I've been using this app on a daily basis for over 4 years now. I love the ability to scan bar codes and to look up items by restaurant. I also like that it syncs to the desktop application. Occasionally it will time out, but that seems to be getting better with recent updates."
320,320,5,2018-08-19T14:35:09.000Z,#happynana,More comprehensive tracking,I‚Äôve used other apps but find this one to have double plus the range of tracking and it takes into account age also rather than just height and weight when factoring RDI.  I am also borderline diabetic so this is tremendously helpful in that respect.
321,321,4,2018-11-01T12:52:13.000Z,Bobby the frog,Good app only suggestion is...,I wish they had a ‚Äúquick add‚Äù
322,322,5,2019-01-08T03:19:17.000Z,Jturner2013,This app is fantastic,It‚Äôs keeping me on track for once after years of thinking I was doing fine without understanding why I wasn‚Äôt making enough progress. It‚Äôs amazing. You need to have discipline to make entries a lot bit their database has a lot of info already
323,323,5,2019-02-01T12:15:00.000Z,Mel4cowz,Lost 8 pounds in a month,"My New Years resolution was to prioritize my health. I‚Äôm journaling, meditating, and wanted to lose weight all as part of the package. Nothing ever worked for me, no diet, or exercise could shed the pounds. Then I joined this app for a study. Omg, I had NO idea how much I was overeating! Simple changes to portions have changed my life. Thank you FatSecret!"
324,324,5,2021-01-24T14:12:52.000Z,Old Man On The Run,Returning User,I got away from FatSecret for a few months and paid the price. During the Covid crisis is the time I should have been latched up. I am back on track and the improvements in this App makes it a lot easier to keep on schedule with my diet and activity. Thank you FatSecret!
325,325,5,2020-11-30T14:45:44.000Z,#spiritdancer,Great app,Helped me lose the last stubborn 10lbs by allowing me to see where my calorie intake needed to be in order to get my body in the necessary caloric deficiency for my body. Weighing in daily and seeing my weight graph steadily head I the right direction was a huge inspiration. I like that you can add foods to the database as well.
326,326,5,2020-09-07T13:18:24.000Z,Okorombo,FatSecret is the ultimate BEST app hands-down!!!,"FatSecret is the BEST food tracking tool hands-down.

329,329,5,2020-02-15T13:20:35.000Z,Allan88889999,Makes it easy to count calories,This app is easy to use.  It has a very large menu of food items - both generic and brand names - which makes it simple to keep track of your caloric intake.  It integrates with my Fitbit so I can track how many calories I have burned versus consumed.
330,330,5,2018-04-16T11:55:30.000Z,1phoebee2,FatSecret is super!,FatSecret has been such a great help in keeping me on track for maintaining my weight loss of 50 pounds for about 5 years now!  I just wish that every item in every restaurant could be found but so many are there that it‚Äôs very helpful. Could items be listed alphabetically?
331,331,4,2018-06-10T17:47:44.000Z,No of the above,Works well,"Great app, would have given five stars but I think it‚Äôs missing somethings. Can‚Äôt always find the meal I am about to eat , and adding the ingredients one at a time can become a bit consuming. Non the less it gets the job done . With my Exercise routine I have already lost 4 lbs in the two weeks that I have been using this app.. üôåüèΩ"
332,332,5,2018-07-25T00:02:48.000Z,Jig2.0,Simplistic,"This app is so easy to use. It basically does EVERYTHING for you automatically. I love that it takes away so much of the guessing in eating.

Accounting firm snacking really shows how calories ad up.  I would like to see this app coordinate with the apple health app to take steps and other physical activities into account
334,334,4,2018-08-21T06:18:01.000Z,IronMan's Iphone,Works good in almost every aspect,"I'm happy using this app! Only concern is not able to add workout & calories burnt from a different app!! It would be great if there can be integration with Nike apps as well(like Nike training , Nike+ Run club ) specially these two! I‚Äôm happy with the integration of health app on iOS and looking forward for the above mentioned integration in the next versions hopefully ü§û"

339,339,4,2020-05-19T20:11:37.000Z,Great free app!!,Great free app,"Overall I like this App because it‚Äôs so easy to use. I like that there are a lot of foods that are searchable. After a while, I did see a lot of incorrect information which isn‚Äôt great because I end up checking against another source like Google. Maybe a review of new foods before they are added to the database would help."

But there are tons of foods in here that I eat already, it‚Äôs fun to look at recipes, and not too difficult to enter a recipe of your own. Working well for me so far."

If I have something for dinner, and eat the same for lunch the next day, I can‚Äôt find it for easy adding. I also wish it would import recipes from the common food sites, as a starter for adding new recipes.  So far, I‚Äôm choosing to stay in this one, instead of MFP, that I‚Äôve used before."

While I could enter just about anything from the details page of an ingredient into my food diary (such as a cup of mayo!) I was often limited to single serving sizes when trying to add to the recipe!  This totally defeats the purpose of my moving to this app, as I was hoping the nutritional information would be more accurate than the one I am currently using. But if I can‚Äôt get a recipe in without pulling my hair out... not an option for me. :("

But I am a breastfeeding mother who needs 500 extra calories daily and different dietary needs, so when this app tells me I'm 119% above my recommended daily intake, I know my intake is fine but I still wish I could change the RDI. Also it's hard to input homemade meals. But it's hard to do that in any calorie counting app."

It's mostly vegetarians and vegans trying to gross people out by commenting on their food photos. I'm not asking them to delete them by hand, just let me ban them from seeing my stuff or commenting on my stuff. Basic app stuff."

It made managing my food intake easy and helped me cut back on the amount of cholesterol in my diet. I really like how it breaks down your fat, calorie, grain, Cholesterols, and protein intake."
416,416,5,2021-08-08T17:50:31.000Z,JoshT48,Finally dropping weight,So many diets out there but the old fashioned calories in/calories out method is something I forgot about. Sticking to my calorie goals and I finally am dropping the stubborn 30 lb of mid-life baggage. Just dropped under 200 fir the first time in 10 years.
417,417,5,2021-06-01T20:47:33.000Z,Tylerwaits,Easy to use!,"Fat Secret makes it easy to track your progress. It has the nutritional data on most foods and if it doesn‚Äôt, you can enter custom foods. It also helps you do maintenance after you‚Äôve achieved your weight goal. Good system!"
418,418,5,2021-02-25T16:22:11.000Z,Braddy14,Free Version is Great,I use the free version to track calories consumed and burnt. The large database of food makes it easy to find and track meals. The ability to sync with Apple health apps is great. Highly recommend to anyone looking to track their meals and health goals!

The other reasons it‚Äôs on me I Phone and PC and any entry‚Äôs update. The summary‚Äôs for my Dietitians and Dr. can be sent in PDF or Excel-spreadsheet or on your phone. It offers many functions to setup your program you desire.
421,421,5,2018-12-11T13:27:57.000Z,lowrider57,Satisfied,A great diet tool I was able to lose 45 pounds by keeping track of my (calorie)food intake. I would recommend this tool to anyone serious about weight loss. This is the true diet keeping calorie intake low by eating less and exercise. This app is the best I‚Äôve seen.
422,422,4,2019-01-07T17:11:24.000Z,Framcesca from Miami,So grateful for the app.,This app has helped me keep track of my eating style using macros. I really think this will help me achieve my goals.  It‚Äôs only missing one star because I think it would be nice to find people through the mobile app (right now you can only do that through a desktop).
423,423,5,2020-09-12T13:09:36.000Z,bobbyrk,Easy Tracking,Very easy app to use for tracking weight and food consumption!  I have been using the app for five weeks now and it helps me better understand what I am consuming and what changes I need to make for weight loss.
424,424,5,2020-08-18T10:56:43.000Z,TransformedByGrace,"Easy to use,helpful, and no badgering",Keeping track of what I eat and the nutritional content is a breeze. This has helped me to stay on track and push through plateaus. What I also appreciate is that I‚Äôm not hassled and badgered constantly to upgrade. Thanks!!
425,425,5,2020-06-16T11:59:37.000Z,Jr5667,Great app!,"One great place to record everything! The only thing I wished it would do was allow for you to customize the meals beyond just breakfast, lunch and dinner. I eat multiple times per day (6+)  and I‚Äôd love to be able to track it that way."
426,426,5,2020-05-21T12:09:43.000Z,Lahickorynut,Great accountability tool,"I‚Äôve been using this for years now to lose and monitor weight. It has a great selection of food items to diary, and the nutrition information usually seems Albert accurate. This is my favorite well-being app!"
427,427,5,2020-02-08T13:50:04.000Z,Scan95,Works great,"What can I say... it‚Äôs simply a great app. Honestly, I don‚Äôt like paying for a subscription (monthly) system which this offers as an in app purchase.  I don‚Äôt use that element, but I would say this app is exceptional at free and honestly, I‚Äôd pay a one time purchase price for it."
428,428,5,2020-01-28T00:17:28.000Z,ClarityAnn,Great app!,"I tried many food logging apps, this one is the best..and it‚Äôs free!  I‚Äôm diabetic so I track carbs and calories. I can even set it to track net carbs. Great community with wonderful support, challenges and groups. If you‚Äôre looking for a food logging app, stop here, you‚Äôve found it!"
429,429,5,2019-09-23T16:01:51.000Z,Nansbank,Has helped me get it off!!,I have a FitBit that counts the calories I burn and this app. tells me the calories I eat. I‚Äôve been carefully counting every bite! If I burn more calories than I eat....the weight comes off. I‚Äôve also been eating more healthy as I‚Äôve developed some heart issues.
430,430,5,2018-06-15T12:03:05.000Z,Issy109,Accountability Partner,This app is AH-MAH-ZING! I‚Äôve tried everything and nothing holds me accountable like this one! There is something about seeing all that unhealthy crap in food clearly and stylishly listed to get your self control in gear!!!! I‚Äôve lost 11 lbs in 3 weeks that‚Äôs to hard work and this accountability partner!
431,431,5,2018-08-04T00:55:05.000Z,Borgesgal,Fat secret,"They say people who track their food are more successful so I‚Äôm very happy I found this app. Fat secret makes it so easy to track all food even fast food. I‚Äôm visual so I love the ability to see my macros in a pie wheel. You can change it too if it‚Äôs not your thing. Love, love it!!!!!"
432,432,5,2018-08-29T12:08:09.000Z,cwalker100,Nice that so many foods are already loaded,Helps keep track of what you‚Äôre eating. Makes it easier to plan your day as you can see how many daily calories you have left since I t subtracts the calories you consume as you go.
433,433,5,2019-01-16T15:12:34.000Z,PhillyRed,Great app,I‚Äôve had the app since 2010 it‚Äôs gratifying to look back and see the progress like when I went on a royal Caribbean cruise and ate a boatload of food and gained 9 pounds.  And then got back on track to lose it.  The features & community make it the best option for me
434,434,5,2019-04-27T13:29:24.000Z,Miketa,Great Calory counter,I've had and used this app for over 10 years with great success. It‚Äôs nice to be able to go back in time and compare your past progress and adjust your calorie intake.  This has really helped my diet and health over the years.
435,435,5,2019-04-28T15:47:45.000Z,teddybear0518,Love this app!,This is the best calorie counter app ever! I love how the food I eat is already in there so I can just select it and not have to put all the nutrition info. I am finally losing weight at a steady pace without starving myself because I know where I'm at with my macros daily.
436,436,5,2019-05-27T14:30:57.000Z,ReeB1313,Excellent assist,"If you‚Äôre trying to improve your diet either to lose weight or just to improve your nutrition, this is the best method I‚Äôve found.  Much better than paper and pen notations with most restaurants‚Äô offerings listed with nutritional information."
437,437,5,2020-06-15T12:02:45.000Z,arlric,Great application,Have been using for six weeks and love the app. Very easy to use and it has most foods you can buy with the ability to choose your portion size. I definitely recommend to anyone who is counting calories.
438,438,5,2019-07-13T14:30:11.000Z,MomT1189,Updated,"Well, I guess when you updated this app.... YOU UPDATED. I used it over a year ago and lost 20 pounds. It changed and was hard to look things up for a period of time and I assume this is the updating period of time. WOW. What an amazingly wonderful app. Thank you VERY MUCH."
439,439,3,2020-01-24T16:04:56.000Z,'Ol Sarge,Very good baseline product needing some tweaks,"In the month I have used the app I find it very good. There are some issues that coukd be addressed next update e.g. a way to permanently remove a food item from the Recenteaten‚Äù area and a much better exercise/calorie listing. It doesn‚Äôt allow variations for treadmills that use 3,4,5...degrees. Good start but needs a bit more thought in future updates."
440,440,4,2018-02-11T07:47:59.000Z,SouthernMommaof5,Needs Manual entry,"There are many times that menu options in restaurants are not listed in the search option.  Please add a manual entry option for meals, where one can add the restaurant name and the menu item, as well as manually entering the nutritional info from the menu or website.  Then I can give 5 stars!"
441,441,5,2018-08-14T13:53:44.000Z,Datsio,Misleading in a good way,"Usually apps that are free have advertisements, are slow and glitchy, and aren‚Äôt that useful. But this app is amazing, it has easy to search foods and their nutritional facts, a very wide variety of foods listed, a helpful chat room, and other awesome capabilities. Very pleasantly surprised"
442,442,4,2019-03-20T10:26:38.000Z,Hawkeye mania,Overall good,This app is pretty easy to use. It tracks things well although I wish that they ‚Äòrecently eaten‚Äô list was longer and crossed over between meals. Some of the information is not accurate on food items compared to the label but overall this app is good.
443,443,5,2021-07-22T14:06:44.000Z,Chrisgass,Easy nutrition tracker,I downloaded this free app so I can keep better track of my protein intake. It has worked perfectly easy easy to track all types of different foods. It keeps me on track every day so I know I‚Äôm getting as much protein as I need.
444,444,5,2021-07-07T02:21:37.000Z,Lunabeat,Great app!,"Keeps track of calories and workouts by day, week and month. Easy to use, has kept me on track to my goal. Lots of extra features available with paid subscription."
445,445,5,2021-02-12T23:13:33.000Z,Juicy legend,My new best friend,I started low to the ground fighting trying to loose weight not knowing what to do or how it was going to work out. Many men are skeptical about stuff like this. Let me tell you it works. I haven‚Äôt paid a dime and I‚Äôve lost 11.2 lbs in 5 weeks. Period!
446,446,5,2020-01-05T07:38:06.000Z,AcesMommie,Fat-U-less,"Fat-U-less as in fabulous because it‚Äôs helping me weigh less. I pay more attention to carbs and calories and love that this app is the all in one stop - can even record exercise, has a menu, weight tracker, chat to make new buddies. This app is fabulous."
447,447,4,2020-06-11T12:30:13.000Z,D.G 14,Super convenient,It‚Äôs very easy to keep track of everything you eat and your weight. It helps me stay motivated when I‚Äôm able to access my progress so easily. I do wish they had a diet plan that was free but majority of the app is so I can‚Äôt complain. It‚Äôs definitely worth a download!
448,448,5,2019-09-02T12:39:31.000Z,PrincessC-NJ,Great Food App,This App was extremely helpful during my first major weight loss season 4 years ago! Now after being married with 2 children I‚Äôm starting back on this App. It‚Äôs harder to lose the weight but I‚Äôll give it a shot!
449,449,3,2019-07-16T11:19:19.000Z,HyperLunatic,Premium Pricing is Egregious,"Free is awesome.  And, this app is awesome. However, I really would like to be able to track water intake as well.  And I am not going to pay $40/year to do that.  Ridiculous pricing for premium features.  Suggest adding another pricing tier, or just making this feature free as well. I don‚Äôt mind paying for this app, it is awesome; but that pricing for water tracking is egregious."
450,450,2,2017-11-30T12:57:53.000Z,Eddy skittles,Doesn't let me log my meals half the time,"The only reason I still use this is because of the feature that allows me to send my daily log to my trainer. The. Only. Reason. The app doesn't even let me log in my food half the time when I need to. It's so frustrating when the ""sorry lost connection"" icon pops up all the time even though I am connected to a very reliable WiFi source. I'm over it."
451,451,5,2018-05-23T03:24:10.000Z,Squitmom,Best one!,I‚Äôve tried and looked for a good calorie tracker and workout log that doesn‚Äôt require a subscription. This one covers it all! Works really well and I‚Äôve found many of my food but if it‚Äôs not in there you can enter it and they will add it!
452,452,4,2018-06-01T03:43:20.000Z,Extonix,Great customer support üëçüëçüëç,The app itself was very easy to use. After a while though I wanted to delete my account just because I wasn't using it often anymore. When I emailed them they quickly replied and cancelled my acclunt all in the same day. Definitely a recommend app.
453,453,5,2018-06-14T16:54:34.000Z,OatmealSquare,Easy accountability,"Has a huge database of foods and caloric content, makes it easy to customize portion size, takes less time than handwriting a food diary. And tracking everything with ease has firmed my spine when confronted with a scrumptious treat."
454,454,5,2018-07-11T23:14:19.000Z,floridammm51,A big help!,Great app that really helps you stay on tract to loose weight. It lets you see how many calories you really eat---a lot more than you thought! Very easy to use and with a very complete list of foods to select from. Highly recommended!
455,455,5,2019-01-17T08:17:14.000Z,Sage WynterFox,Let‚Äôs me print free reports,"For a free app, this is the best. There are other things you need to pay for in the premium version (like logging your water), but my favorite feature in the free version is the ability to export and print my food logs for my health coach."
456,456,4,2019-04-20T11:18:22.000Z,antistupid2019,Perfect for Keto,"Great app, very helpful tracking my calorie intake along with my Keto diet. A bit time consuming to initially find foods and plug things in when first starting app but afterwards it‚Äôs a breeze to keep up with my daily calorie intake excercise, etc. I wasn‚Äôt losing weight until I started using this super helpful tracking tool!"
457,457,5,2019-05-05T21:15:11.000Z,sheribear68,Best food logging app,My nutritionist recommended this app and I love the way it lets you log food and keeps track of macros.

459,459,4,2019-12-27T03:00:29.000Z,Js essentials,Great,"could y‚Äôall add a time stamp on the ‚Äúbreakfast/ lunch/ dinner/ snacks‚Äù when we log our food. sometimes i forget when i last ate. also a reverse food log? a ‚Äúwhat I didn‚Äôt eat‚Äù option. for example if i log a burger, but didn‚Äôt eat the buns, I could search for buns separately and redact it from my meal. thanks !!"
460,460,5,2017-10-07T12:15:44.000Z,amante de gato,FatSecret is the best!,"I can't seem to diet without this app. It keeps me accountable and is so easy to use. It ""remembers"" my meals and I can choose them quickly. They have a huge database of restaurant and prefab dishes that already have the nutrients tallied. It basically does EVERYTHING you need it to do. I love it!"
461,461,5,2018-01-28T17:17:22.000Z,Sky_barnes,Excellent and completely free,"Requires a free account, and only works online, but provides all the nutrient breakdowns (macro and micro) of entered foods hidden behind subscriptions in other food tracking apps. Has an active community to encourage us all and ask questions of."

463,463,5,2021-04-23T14:09:01.000Z,434Lucy,Easy to use,"Has just about every food i use, restaurants & commercial brands also, very easy to use. I like that I can set my own macros and get fat, carbohydrate and protein for every meal as well as for the whole day . Really enjoying it!"

465,465,5,2021-02-27T19:42:48.000Z,Michael2135,Best Calorie Counting app,I‚Äôve been using this app for about 6 years. The combo between being able to track your weight and calories on the same app is very useful. The interface is simple and easy to use
466,466,3,2021-03-10T15:58:26.000Z,Ed1958Texas,Edwin,"Good app. It does everything I need... I am having trouble with the calorie count not matching the product when scanned, also, many products don‚Äôt show up when scanned. when searching for some products manually they can‚Äôt be found by brand so I‚Äôm forced to choose a similar product with a different brand."
467,467,5,2021-01-28T20:11:34.000Z,Littlejaydoll,Please don‚Äôt become sellouts,"Love love love this app. It‚Äôs easy and intuitive, much better than the WW app. It‚Äôs also great because they aren‚Äôt invasive with their agenda or ads, please don‚Äôt become popular and start interrupting the app with ads, this is too good of a product :)"
468,468,5,2021-01-14T13:39:05.000Z,Speckdude,It helps!,"When I use this my good habits stay on point. When I don‚Äôt track so lose track. It‚Äôs robust, easy and helps me stay in control. It‚Äôs a great app! I am a strength coach and fitness business owner. I recommend it to all my clients. Yes even fitness trainers need help."
469,469,5,2020-09-25T16:16:25.000Z,ReneRye,I love this app,"It‚Äôs easy to use, I just take a picture and find my food quickly or scanning...  I recommend it to have an almost perfect record of yours meals in the week/ and you can also see your macro nutrients."
470,470,4,2017-10-20T14:16:45.000Z,Volkolak,One of the easiest ways to keep a food journal,Once you get used to the app it becomes fairly straightforward to record what you ate. With this app you also become part of very supportive community to aid in your weight loss journey. I'm giving it 4 stars because sometimes the UI is confusing.
471,471,5,2017-11-30T16:35:01.000Z,cathycreates,Easy to use. Great tool!!,This is a simple way to keep a food diary. It has a huge data bank of foods and their nutritional value so finding what you want to log in is a snap. Everything you need and not a bunch of stuff you don‚Äôt!
472,472,4,2018-02-28T13:22:59.000Z,J9lapierre,Very helpful health tool!,Tracking my food intake has shone me where I have opportunity to improve my eating habits to support my weight loss goal. It‚Äôs easy to use and I love the graphical presentation of my stats. Please add a feature to track water intake too. Then it would be a one stop app for my health tracking needs.
473,473,4,2018-06-16T14:15:44.000Z,Running For The Roses,Really great,The only thing I would focus on improving is customizing meals. It‚Äôs pretty basic and doesn‚Äôt work well for me (unless I‚Äôm doing it wrong which is possible.) Also for logging foods. Longer lists of Most eaten would make it faster for me to log food every day. Thank you for asking!!
474,474,4,2018-10-25T11:41:34.000Z,njahou,FatSecret Value,App has many popular brand carb values.  For example heavy whipping cream which should have zero carbs. Only seems to have that with the organic brands. Others like KROGER or Shweeps Albertsons all have at least 1 or 2 carbs. Meaning some kind of difference or filler is added    Same for cheeses. Easy to help you track as well
475,475,5,2019-02-02T18:58:35.000Z,Spinnertowinner,This is what I come back to,I have tried many calorie/nutrition tracking apps.... and download the newest ones that come up on the App Store- but this is the best one that I continue to return to.  It is comprehensive and simple to use.  Thank you!!
476,476,5,2020-04-26T05:12:47.000Z,rwingr,Too easy,"In my opinion this is the easiest weight control app to use regardless of your goal. The database is endless. I have used it to bulk, cut, and maintain. I recommend to everyone I can that has a specific ‚Äúlook‚Äù they are going for."
477,477,5,2020-03-25T22:29:20.000Z,Buraddo79,Great.,"Helps me count calories which is all I needed. I‚Äôve lost over five pounds just doing that. When you count calories it makes you think. That‚Äôs been the difference. Set a calorie goal, not a weight goal. Let the math do the rest."
478,478,5,2021-02-15T21:03:32.000Z,SuperCita,Easy to use,Easy input for food intake so I can keep tabs on how many calories I‚Äôm consuming and how much exercise I‚Äôm getting. I don‚Äôt feel deprived as am making better choices! Loosing weight slowly but surely. The healthy way...
479,479,5,2021-01-24T14:31:21.000Z,Speensalf,"Extensive database, easy to track macros",Very easy to use and track calories from their extensive data sources. You can find EXACTLY what you‚Äôre eating most times or close approximations the other 10% of the time.
480,480,5,2018-01-26T11:20:18.000Z,Vilaeze,Great app!,This app has served my husband and I well through our weight loss journey. The flexibility of eating out and making healthy recipes while being able to track your daily calorie and macros is incredibly helpful!

484,484,2,2020-07-31T15:14:13.000Z,ksdaman,Ok if you want free,Just downloaded it to compare if better than my fitness pal. Couldn‚Äôt find 1 minute Quaker Oats on scanner. Found when typed in. It has a pre determined amount already that you can‚Äôt change. You have to scroll and fraction that predetermined portion. Gives me my daily caloric amount but I don‚Äôt see a date where I will hit my target weight goal. My Fitness Pal still beats this easily.
485,485,5,2019-11-23T16:16:40.000Z,gmarjohn,Best way to track if you do a lot of cooking from scratch,"Love the cookbook feature as I can plug in ingredients and serving size and get accurate nutritional info more easily than with MyFitnessPal, better and easier interface too."

This app WAS great because I could look up carbohydrates in meals from restaurants and I knew exactly how much insulin I needed to take for a meal. I don‚Äôt know why the restaurant information is not available anymore but I guess I will delete this app and find a new one....
657,657,5,2020-07-14T11:08:29.000Z,xxxxxccvv,Easy to use,This app makes diet monitoring a snap. Easy access to just about any and all food and brand products. Daily intake of calories and weight lose is really simple. Love this app.

702,702,4,2019-03-10T14:49:52.000Z,Marymaryqc13,Very useful,Excellent tool. Would be nice if it would remember stuff that repeats and repeats -like 2 cups of coffee every day. Why not have the default that pops up be the last used? (This applies to SO MANY apps!!) also would be nice if it recognized everyone‚Äôs ubiquitous steps as exercise.
703,703,5,2019-04-06T12:13:03.000Z,leighcbbg,Excellent tracking options,"...although don‚Äôt feel the motivational comments section, or sharing area is necessary for me. All in all, I‚Äôve lost 6 lbs since Mid March and am hooked on it. :)"

I like that I can set a weekly meal plan (small add‚Äôl fee but totally worth it) and then adjust my days as I go through the week.

839,839,1,2019-11-12T21:38:10.000Z,costcosamplesnatcher,Ok app,"The FatSecret community is mostly encouraging and supportive. There is no way to block those who body shame, bully or use the FS community as another social media app. Overall a great app but experience is ruined by a few who targets those who have successfully lost who maintained their weight. They‚Äôve changed it in an upgrade. Took away some features like preplanning to introduce a paid version."

2312,2312,5,2018-05-14T19:32:26.000Z,Rodsaturkey,My experience with Fat Secret,"I have used Fat Secret for several years now. I used it to lose 25 lbs several years ago via calorie cycling, and chose it because a calorie cycling friend was using it, it had lots of good features, and it was FREE. However, once the weight was lost, I stopped tracking the calories I consumed, my weight eventually rebounded, and I added some more weight, as well. Because studies show that people who maintain long term weight loss track calories, exercise regularly, and eat a low fat diet, I have returned to Fat Secret as a tool to help me once again lose the weight, and this time maintain it by tracking my calorie intake. My goal is to lower my set weight progressively this time and maintain it. I have already seen good early results after less than 2 weeks."

2452,2452,3,2019-03-17T19:43:30.000Z,OFisherJr,A bit frustrating...,"I don‚Äôt know the source of the foods found in the Search but I‚Äôd prefer the App data used for the Search to be empty and only populated by the respective User account if FatSecret isn‚Äôt going to manage the data-table. Often nutritional information for specific foods is incorrect or not quantifiable e.g., such as a serving being specified as 1 slice or 1 portion. What does that mean? How big a slice what is the weight or volume of the slice or portion? Totally meaningless. Often I‚Äôve had to go onto the internet to find Calorie (kcal) information that I can hope is similar if not exact and use it. How about 1 cup of popcorn? When you make popcorn a specific weight of kernels are popped and this is what the serving size should be based on as it is readily quantified as opposed to 1 cup!"

When in the food or exercise diary page where the wrong date appears, to get the correct one, select the ""..."" menu item at the top right. Then select ""Change Date"", and next select ""Tomorrow"", not ""Today"", which is already selected; you can also select the date for tomorrow on the date wheel below. By selecting the next day, when you press ""Done"", you'll return to the diary with the correct date now showing."
2511,2511,5,2010-05-17T22:57:30.000Z,Uh-nonymous,Useful and simple,"I was looking for a calorie tracker that would record whatever I put into it, but this app does so much more. Not only does it do that, it also comes with a database to help me find caloric information on a wide variety of foods, plus it tracks activities (even resting!) and calorie burn. It's simple and I really like it. I haven't used the barcode scanner yet but so far I haven't had any problems. I also like the fact that I don't have to sign up for anything, it's an independent and free app. I think you can sign up for an account to get more weight-loss help, which is a nice option, but I don't like apps that force you to sign up for stuff. Also, as for the complaints about losing the Weight Watchers point counter, I don't know for sure, but Weight Watchers has its own app so maybe they complained because they didn't want another app using its trademarked info? Just a thought. I wouldn't hold it against Calorie Counter though."

2520,2520,3,2010-08-02T02:18:29.000Z,Granny27,Granny,"Lots of good features.  Good lists on Restaurant items which is handy, but the one food item I need from Cheesecake Factory is the Lemoncello Cream Torte, and of course, it isn't in the list!  I tried adding it to my list, but haven't figured out how to add a food item without having to enter all the nutrition info, so I couldn't get it to accept it.  I only know the calories on some items, but it won't let me add the item to my list unless I add fat, carbs proteins, etc, which I don't know and haven't been able to come up with in a search.  I tried to guesstimate, and of course, it wouldn't accept that either.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I can't use this program unless some things are simplified.  It also needs smaller units of measure, such as 1/8 of a serving.  Smallest I've seen is 1/4 of a serving. Anyway, I would love to use this because the the good features, but won't because of the issues mentioned."
2521,2521,5,2011-09-10T01:31:09.000Z,roxiblue,Can't believe it's free!,"I was thinking of paying for the Weight Watchers online program when I saw a recommendation for this app, and thought I'd try it first since it's free. I've been using it for five days and so far I LOVE it. I especially like that it counts resting calories in addition to exercise, and the diet calendar keeps a running total of what you've eaten and what you've burned. Everything I've eaten has been in the database, and I've had no problems with crashes when using the scanner."
2522,2522,5,2012-01-03T15:58:20.000Z,kellyami,Amazing!,"This app is so easy to use and yet it's got so much to it! I've only been using this app for 3 days and absolutely love it. You can scan barcodes of the foods you eat, adjust the serving amount, and take pictures of it too. It shows you a line graph of the progress you have made, as well as a recommended daily intake (rdi) of calories per day based off of BMI (not accurate but it gives you a starting point). If you don't have a barcode to scan then you can get a general idea of calories by searching ""Bacon"" which brings up different ways bacon can be cooked and treated with a general idea on serving and calorie sizes."
2523,2523,3,2012-04-18T16:41:27.000Z,Uselessdetails,So-so,The UI for this app leaves a bit to be desired.  Often several dozen or more clicks to enter a single food item eaten.  They insist on painting food pictures on every screen which isn't what I need when I'm counting calories nor on a slow network connection.
2524,2524,3,2014-10-01T16:53:35.000Z,ToyaOC,WTH is wrong with the dates?!!?,"I like this app a lot but a few issues: Wth is wrong with the dates?!!?? I click the drop box and click October 1, but then at the top, it says ""tomorrow"". No, Oct. 1st is today. Since update, the dates are off by one for every day in every year and idk why. I clicked Sept 8 in the drop box but the top border shows Sept 7th. So idk if I should go by the drop box or the actual date and today just fill in on ""tomorrow's"" food intake. Really annoying!!! Also, there are A LOT of errors in the calorie and serving sizes in the database. For example these cookies I ate were 2 cookies for 160 calories. However, the app showed 3 cookies for 160 calories. I've come across items that were just completely different calorie number so then I hve to say I ate 1 1/4 serving, even though I only ate 1, just to get to correct calorie amount. . Wish there was an easy way to send a note to company to make corrections."
2525,2525,4,2015-06-06T17:50:59.000Z,Elysepatrice,4.5 stars,"I love this app. Been using it for a few years, and it has helped me tremendously with keeping track of what I eat. I have a few nitpicks, though, which is why I'm not giving the full 5 stars. 1) The columns. I want to choose which 5 items to see at the top. I can only choose three, since you've made calories and RDI permanent. I don't need those since I can see both on the opening screen. Let me choose all 5 items myself to truly customize my usage! 2) The cookbook. I LOVE this element, and use it every day, for my smoothies and homemade meal recipes. I can even guesstimate for restaurant meals when needed. BUT I would like a way to access it independently, without having to add a meal item or hit the search bar. This creates added steps I don't need if I just want to create or edit recipes. Just a direct link to the cookbook would be great! 3)...hmmm, I don't think there is a 3 for now! Keep up the great work, guys!"
2526,2526,5,2016-03-23T14:22:59.000Z,Rrc623,"Longtime user, best app out there.","I've been a member of Fat Secret since 2011. When the smartphone app became available, I jumped right onboard. The database is so large I can't think of a single time that I wasn't able to find a food I'd eaten. I've tried My Fitness Pal but it's too cluttered and not as user-friendly as Fat Secret. I'm also a member of Weight Watchers Online, and I log daily in both apps. What's nice about FS is that I can track my weight daily whereas I have to wait an entire week to log my WW weight. There's something about having that daily commitment that really keeps me on point. I'm also a fan of the fat-carb-protein breakdown that you can see on the desktop site, so I wish they could bring that to the app. Since you can still see your total grams of each macro at the top of your food log, you can do the math in your head, but that pie chart is hot. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2527,2527,5,2016-03-31T17:19:38.000Z,Scartissuearmor,"Less clunky than MFP, counts NET carbs","Was using My Fitness Pal for years but every update made it more difficult to use for me, to the point that I stopped tracking. Got recommended this app by the LCHF/Keto diet community because it tracks net carbs at a glance. The app is attractive and easy to use."
2528,2528,5,2016-08-01T11:19:41.000Z,KP8**,Loyal fan,"I used fat secret before it was a mobile app. I would log on from my computer. It has been helpful in my efforts to lose weight and get in shape (multiple times!). The calorie counter has pretty much all the foods I eat and there is a good listing of exercises. I use it on my Apple Watch as well. I do miss the communities-the social network piece that used to be on the computer version-maybe it still is there-I just don't access it from my computer. I would like to see this enhancement in the future: the option to enter all your food in the morning and then check it off throughout the day. I do enter everything in the morning now, but then the watch tells me I have 0 calories. Just a little thing, but would be nice. Oh and a water counter-so I can make sure I get 8 glasses a day"
2529,2529,4,2017-09-12T21:52:21.000Z,Pat9R,A great replacement for MyFitnessPal,"I really like this app. It's a lot like MyFitnessPal was before it was stuffed full of ads and scamware. I only have two complaints. Quantities are broken down into quarters with no way to enter a number. You can't enter 1/3 cup something, only 1/4 or 1/2. To enter more specific quantities grams are used, which is not always convenient. The other more frustrating issue is foods are assigned a meal type and stick to that meal type when adding meals. If I eat something for dinner today the items will show up tomorrow in ""recently eaten"" but only when adding dinner. If I eat the leftovers for lunch I have to add all the items again from scratch under lunch. It's enough of a pain that I've started adding all meals under 'snacks' so it's easier, which is a shame because the breakdown chart is handy to check if you're spreading calories out evenly."
2530,2530,3,2010-05-05T02:18:16.000Z,erkitten4,I love this app!!!,"Before this app, I had to use 2 different apps to reach my goals.  I have been a Diet and Exercise Asst users for years on various OS systems, and I use iWatcher for points. I love both of those apps, but this app does the function of both of those. Now they add a barcode scanner, and I get to delete yet another app from my phone. This app very rarely crashes, is easy to use, and does everything. STRONG WORK GUY!!!  Keep it up."
2531,2531,5,2010-11-09T15:31:43.000Z,KayInNC,Great App - One Request,"This is a great app for tracking food intake and exercise.  The barcode scanner doesn't work on my iPod (4th), no big deal, I figure it was designed to work on the iPhone, so I use the keypad entry for UPC.  One Request - It would be REALLY nice if I could access my history of food and exercise within the app on my iPod without requiring an internet connection.  There are times when I want to check on what I've eaten previously, but can't because I'm not connected (which happens a lot in a rural area or on the road). An embedded notepad in the app would also come in handy for jotting down food and exercise when there's no internet connection.  I even looked for a paid version of this app that might have these features."
2532,2532,5,2011-04-16T23:25:59.000Z,Lopezt7,I'd be lost without this app!,"This app is probably the only reason why I'm actually losing weight and keeping it off. I've broken my diet several times for the past 5 yrs (caused by lack of motivation) but this app makes it almost effortless to shed those  pounds. It allows you to keep track of your workouts and calorie intake according to your height, weight and age."
2533,2533,5,2012-05-15T22:09:34.000Z,asteriskadonis,"Flexible, customizable, better than similar apps","I tried several calorie counting apps and this one worked the best for me. You don't have to sign up for a website, but you can if you want too, which is a nice touch. This app has had all the different kinds of food items I have searched for so far, and you can select between various portion options (weight, volume, unit, etc.) which is convenient; other apps I tried only had cups of one food item, grams of another, etc. which is a pain. You can also edit your target daily calorie level or just accept the one the app recommends to you based on your profile, activity level, and weight loss goals. Simple and sweet! Try this app first and save yourself some time."
2534,2534,4,2013-07-05T14:32:37.000Z,SK150,Skinnylinny155,"I really love this app!  I can look up restaurants, all foods, name brands, & store brands.  It has a great list of exercises with the intensity of calories burned.  It also has a scanner so if I don't find the food listed, I can just scan the barcode to receive the caloric value. It also has an option for dividing the amount of a food. It keeps a daily updated count of calories consumed. The only thing I don't like is that when you enter your weight, it doesn't readjust and it doesn't show up on the graph. I would like to see that changed."
2535,2535,3,2014-10-16T16:08:40.000Z,FreedomLover,Update messed up some things,"So this WAS my favorite weight loss app, and I was looking forward to it having an update. Of course something is always changed that ruins things. A minor lame change is the new look/design. But now, irritatingly, when you input an activity, the ""remainder"" of time in the 24 hrs defaults to adding TO either sleep or rest!! Ridiculous. So I have to keep trying to balance the activities back & forth so I don't end up with 9 hours of sleep or 7 hours of rest etc. What the heck?? Why not just be able to input the totals of each activity, sleep and rest included. Before the update you could choose what activity you wanted to add/subtract time from. It just doesn't seem as simple to use as before. Have started to look at other apps and I had hoped to not have to do that."
2536,2536,5,2016-03-30T10:53:45.000Z,miriamsnow,It works if you work it,"A great calorie counting app. If you've counted calories (or fat grams, or any other food stat) manually, you'll love the ease of doing it digitally. FatSecret makes it really easy - tons of foods (including brand names) to chose from, adjustable portions, etc. If you can't find the food you're looking for, just google the food and fatsecret - there's often an entry from another country that will suit you. (I live outside my country of origin and this is a helpful feature for me). You can also save entire meals and recipes so you don't have to re-enter entire groups of specialized foods. You can also enter exercise. This is a great app to help you stay conscious of what you eat, which is a necessary first step to changing your eating patterns."

2538,2538,5,2017-01-16T02:35:58.000Z,Moy Wah Fei,Excellent!!!,"I've tried many other apps but none seemed right for me. By chance I ran across this app. This is perfect. The food data base is ideal not only providing commercial product information (which I rarely need as I try to avoid fast foods and processed foods), but also has generic information as well. The photo diet feature is unique in that you simply take a photo of your food and the tech team will analyze it for you providing you nutritional feedback to use. That is amazing!"
2539,2539,3,2017-05-15T18:51:32.000Z,Chchch1234,Macro percentages are calculating incorrectly,"First, I have to say that I love this app and it helped me lose 65 pounds. But I have recently started tracking macros and there is a bug in the reporting that is figuring the macro percentages incorrectly. Protein and Fat values appear to be switched. This is so frustrating! I am still able to figure them by grams, which is more accurate anyway, but the percentages give a fantastic visual snapshot of where I am. Also, I would really like this app to go back to defaulting to the food diary page. I have absolutely zero interest in seeing what other people are eating. And finally, I'd love to see the macros, nutrients and calorie reports default to today. Again, I'm not as interested in my weekly values. They are nice to see, but I need the information for ""today"" all day. Otherwise, great app. You get 5 stars when all of this is addressed!"
2540,2540,4,2010-11-19T23:23:03.000Z,aDuffBrew,No one app is perfect.,"I've tried several apps in this category.  Some are better at customizing portion sizes, exercise routines, or have a more extensive restaurant database.  FatSecret's entry isn't the best in any category nor does it have the ""prettiest"" interface.  That said, it certainly ranks well in every categories and when taken together, I feel it offers the best all-in-one solution."

I have been using it since last February 2011 and have been very pleased. The weight tracker is my favorite part, but it is definitely glitchy. If you put in a note with your weight, it kind of floats around on the screen into the wrong place instead of staying under the date you wrote it. (This has never been improved. 8/1/12)"

2544,2544,5,2015-08-08T15:29:16.000Z,CobraJackson,Valuable Tool,"I've been using this app for seven months.  If you are wondering where the faults are in your diet this will show you.  I have lost thirty-five pounds this year, it's not a prison sentence, there are plenty of days when I reach the end of the day and there are still enough calories left for a small junk food cheat.  If you are honest with it, the app will tell you the truth.  Not always pleasant after a 1300 calorie All Star Breakfast at three in the morning and you discover you are at 192% of your daily food budget.  That is to say, it is a guide, a metric to measure, it doesn't do the work for you but it will give you a fighting chance"
2545,2545,2,2015-08-17T05:15:48.000Z,SunnysideupFL,OK but no app support within the app,"Did not really use. I could not find the wine ‚Äì if I have a glass of wine I have to be able to include those calories. The app does not include anything relating to portions. One should be able to go to pizza and add more than one slice ‚Äì without exiting and having to go back in and repeating. I like to use apps that have built in apps support and a place to provide feedback within the app. To me that is a reflection that the App developer cares about what the users think and also cares about improving the app. This is not the case with this app. There is nothing with in the app for support or feedback. I do not want to have to go back into the App Store search for the app search for the developer search for a place to provide feedback, etc. if they don't care enough or should I go through the trouble. Hence i am deleting the app."

My only complaint is that I cook using Cooking Light and/or HelloFresh.  These recipes include all the nutritional information, but this app does not allow for me to easily add these recipes.  I have to create a recipe, which takes forever adding each individual food item.  This would be fine if I used that one recipe over and over, but I don't often do that when I cook with HelloFresh.  I would love an option where I could add my own item and the nutritional info.  For now, I just search for a recipe with a similar calorie count.  It's not totally accurate, but it does the job."

Thankfully the courts are getting better at punishing such ahole companies (patent trolls) and making them pay instead. All because this app is TOTALLY AWESOME!! I've tried many ""diet tracking"" apps and this really is the best. Not only because of the well design, but also because of the most comprehensive list of foods I've ever seen. Love the ability to customize and also submit new foods for everyone to use. Love it. One star off because of some problem with the ""popular foods"" list. Can't see pick anything from that list??"
2550,2550,4,2011-08-12T19:34:49.000Z,Cynthetiq,All this AND it's free?!!,"This app is awesome, easy to use, has all the features I need, and the search finds just about every food item I could think of, even some store brands. Even if the search cant find it, it's easy to enter all the info and add it yourself. The only difficult thing is trying to estimate the nutrition info for home cooked meals. Overall, I'm happy with this app because it makes it so simple to keep track of my progress that it is encouraging rather than frustrating. One gripe however... The recipes don't tell you how much is in a serving, it just says one serving... Do I gotta break out a scale and measure 8 exactly equal portions or can you tell me one serving equals 1 cup?!"
2551,2551,1,2013-05-27T11:10:50.000Z,Cytddgbjuddbkod,"Can't use if you are too fat (and I don't know what they consider ""too fat"")","I was able to set up an account and add foods and track everything. First weigh-in comes along and I enter my new weight, which happens to be lower than my starting weight. A message pops up that tells me I am 'very heavy' and need to consult a doctor before beginning any diet. Thanks, but I already know I'm fat. That's why I'm on a diet! And my doctor fully supports my diet, for the record. I can hit 'save' but it just brings up the message again and won't save my new weight. Even though it saved my starting weight - which was higher!! Apparently this is for the people who need to lose 20 pounds but not for the people with more to lose. Very disappointed. I'm uninstalling this app and finding one that's a little more open to helping overweight people lose weight."
2552,2552,5,2015-07-29T13:42:29.000Z,KitKat7675,User Friendly and Free!,My friend turned me on to this app.  We are trying to be calorie conscious on the way to our fitness goals and The Calorie Counter by FatSecret has been very helpful!  It has a huge database of nutrition information and what isn't there you can enter in yourself in a snap!  The UPC scan feature is very convenient too!  All this along with the fact that it pairs an equally user friendly log for calories burnt during daily exercise and graphs and charts to give you a pictorial view of your progress in every area is a great way to see trends in your eating and activity habits.  Get the app.  You won't regret it!
2553,2553,5,2015-08-08T14:01:57.000Z,KittensAndUnghhhMachining,Side by side comparison,"Compared side by side with iTrackBites with in-app purchases, and I greatly prefer FatSecret. Note that this app is a calorie counter whereas the other is point-based. Wish I could get a refund for the other app, and give to FatSecret. Easier ""one stop"" search engine instead of searching multiple lists, manually. Either more food choices, or search engine is more intuitive; I couldn't find more items in the other app than found in FatSecret. And using this app, following their calorie limit, I lose 8 lbs in first month; for me this is a surprise.  I like this app and will continue to use it. Thanks for reading!"

2555,2555,4,2015-08-17T13:59:40.000Z,GreenhillsPioneers,Effective App,"Using this app has given me better success than other attempts without any form of a food/exercise log. Tried side by side with MyFitnessPal & prefer this although either could work depending on one's personal preference.  Only complaint is that many food choices are set up from chain restaurant menus-probably food you DON'T want to eat on a diet; it's not always easy to find the healthier meals you're preparing at home. (Capability may exist to create home recipes-I haven't found it). Because of this get calorie estimates which may be +/-10% of actually, but in the long run the app helps keep you honest. Technically easy to use & have never had any glitches."
2556,2556,5,2017-02-05T15:01:22.000Z,Bzazlady,Best weight loss tool ever!,"Fabulous app. Very useful. Very helpful. I love how easy this app is to use you can keep track of your weight, exercise, goals, and your food intake. You can look up each item you eat, whether you eat out buy something at the store and then fix it at home. Once you select it and indicate the amount you ate, it shows the amount of fat, carbs, protein, etc. you consumed and then you can see your totals for the day at the top of the page. It also show the percentages. I have FatSecret on my PC and am using the app on my phone and they automatically sync what you enter. Best tool ever!! LOVE IT!!!!"
2557,2557,4,2017-03-21T20:00:08.000Z,Lori12344,Missing info.,"I have been using this for over a year and I love that it has no ads! Also, the interface is very easy to use. My 1 complaint is that it's missing alot of nutritional information for many food items. For example, if you are on a low-carb or Atkins diet and you want to put in a bun-less whataburger Patty there is no listing for it and only has the full whataburger.  I have to get out of the app, go find the information and then go back in and try to find something matching it manually in the search field. Also it doesn't let me save the meal for easier input next time. I am debating trying another app for this reason :/"
2558,2558,5,2017-04-26T19:02:27.000Z,sweet green fan,I lost 20 pounds since I started tracking calories here,Worked beautifully for me and my husband. We tracked for 2 months straight while pairing this app with the Daily Dozen app (free) to make sure we were actually adding nutritious calories to our diet while reducing the empty ones. This app works pretty well and it lets you actually realize that your choice of foods is more important than just reducing the amount of food you eat. Exercise comes next.
2559,2559,5,2017-07-26T19:25:34.000Z,Mayachristine,"Great, useful app!","I really like this app. I was previously just counting calories with my calculator, but this is way easier and saves all my information. Almost any food is found in the FatSecret system, and if you can't find a food you can do a custom entry. I am particularly fond of the analysis functions, which allow me to see how much carbs, fat and protein I'm eating. I can also track my exercise each day and my sleep habits. I wish that it had a function where I could count my own calories burned while exercising, the built-in calorie count seems to be higher than what my exercise machine tells me I'm burning."
2560,2560,3,2011-08-18T18:47:52.000Z,Mmmmmmmaaaaaaddddddiiiiieeeeeee,Constantly crashes!!!,I LOVE this app ... when it works! The barcode scanner (using the cell phone camera) is hit or miss & crashes at least 10 times a day. The keypad function to manually enter barcode numbers (without using the camera) crashes literally every time I try to use it. This is extremely frustrating considering the searchable food database is limited. Other than the scanner there's really no way to enter foods that aren't already known in the database. I'm using an iPhone 4 - used to work great on my iPhone 3 & before the last update was released. I tried deleting then reinstalling but it doesn't help. Would be 5 stars if these issues were fixed.
2561,2561,5,2013-07-06T00:49:56.000Z,Stan-,Well done ... Best of 1/2 dozen apps tried,"My goal is to count the calories I eat during the day and and track how close to my maximum.  This app does the trick.  Lets me scan in items that I'm eating prepackaged.  For cooking with a scale to measure the weights of ingredients, allows me to measure the amounts in grams and does the conversions calories, fat etc.  Possible improvements might include let me repeat the meal quickly ‚Äì when I have multiple ingredients it's a pain to have to enter each all over again.  And, let me pay you a few dollars more to get rid of advertisements at the bottom of the screen."
2562,2562,5,2015-06-30T14:15:57.000Z,Cheesieinvegas,Love this app!!!,"Im at that age where I'm going through the change. My metabolism has slowed down and I've put on about 17 pounds that I cannot get rid of even though I work out 3-5 days a week.  I now have the Apple watch and this app!!! A dynamic duo!! My watch tracks my heart rate, my workouts and do much more AND it helps me push myself a little more!! Combine that with your app which breaks down carbs, proteins, calories etc and accounts for calories burned .. And I have lost 4.5 pounds in 2 1/2 weeks BUT I am eating whenever I am hungry.  This app helps me keep my carb intake down among other variables!  I might get this weight off!!!!"
2563,2563,4,2015-10-17T13:45:53.000Z,dtbrouillette,Fat Secret Review,I gave this app four stars because I do love how you can track your food. But my only wish is too have a better fitness section. What I mean is having multiple options of what you want to record instead of just the time and calories such as reps and sets and the weight. But also to have a part were it tracks your steps/ moves if you are running walking or jogging. The last thing that I wish this had was a chart to show you how much of each drink you had consumed just like the ihydrate app. So if they consider my suggestions than I will definetly be giving them 5 stars instead of 4 stars.
2564,2564,4,2016-03-30T13:56:56.000Z,drtakriss,Great app...but,I've used off and on since 2011. Tried others but always come back to this one. Couple of tweaks I'd like to see:
2565,2565,5,2016-08-29T12:19:34.000Z,THE ONLY M IN THE WORLD,Amazing app!,"When it said I should eat about 2600 calories a day to lose weight, I thought, ""no freaking way."" I found out that I was gaining weight because I was under eating and over exercising. Apparently a lot of dietitians have people like me come in. So since I have been using this app, I have lost 10 lbs but trying to eat that much calories sometimes is a hard thing for me when I work all day. But I'm trying! I've got about 15 more to lose till I'm happy! And I'm sure I'll be using this app for the rest of my life to make sure I stay on track. Thanks, FatSecret!"
2566,2566,5,2016-10-04T23:00:36.000Z,Eisor35,Fabulous!,"I have never written a review before but this app is just too awesome not to.  I was diagnosed with diabetes and with this app I track total carbs, protein, sugar, fat and sodium.  There's other options available also.  It has name brand foods, restaurants and a barcode scanner.  It also has a wonderful website and great support if you need it.  There's just too many great things to notate but you won't be sorry if you try it!  I've lost 45 lbs and I'm still losing and my diabetes and high blood pressure is controlled!  I feel like a brand new person!  I will never be without Fatsecret!"
2567,2567,5,2017-03-17T03:23:32.000Z,RWeber2021,Best calorie counting app by far and #1 in customer service,"I've been using Fat Secret for over 2 years now and I absolutely love it. Works like a charm. Their reports are top notch, the customization features state-of-the-art and having a customer service that actually takes care of you when you have a problem is just out of this world, especially because this app is free."
2568,2568,5,2017-04-26T20:53:55.000Z,Robhero83,This App is a MUST if you are serious about your health goals,"I started using this app about two years ago. It was recommended to me by one of my good friends who also happens to be a personal trainer. Since I started using it, I've been more conscious about the foods I eat and their nutritional content."
2569,2569,2,2017-06-06T06:00:35.000Z,awesome ava,good but needs a few features to be really great,first off this app has a lot of really good features that my fitness pal did not have such as a net carb setting and ability to share your entire food journal with someone. there are a few features that the app needs though to really compete with MFP though.
2570,2570,2,2010-04-18T04:28:16.000Z,JamieCrews,Crashing App,"I LOVED this app before the last update!! I used it every day but now I cannot even get into my ""food diary"" without it crashing. I see that after the last update they now have an advertisment banner running, I wonder if this is creating network bandwidth issues. I do love that is it free but I would PAY for the functionality of being able to use it. I would love if the developers would give us the option to PAY for an app that does not have the advertisment banner. Also, I do P90X and wear a heart rate montior and would love if I could save my workouts for future use, just so I don't have to re-enter the data every time. :)  Please and thank you!!  Fix the crashes and it would be a 5 star!!"
2571,2571,4,2012-04-19T05:01:17.000Z,1isalone,Works great on IPhone but not IPad,"After 2 weeks I figured out how to get net carbs to show but wish I could have more than 4 categories to show. For those who want net carbs, go under the three ... at top right and choose your settings for display."
2572,2572,4,2015-01-21T16:47:05.000Z,Purplemom8,Very useful App,I weigh and/or measure my food to keep honest proportions. I love that I have the option of servings in ozs. vs. only measurements. There is such a HUGE database of foods but sometimes something isn't there and I love that I can add it. I love that I can enter recipes and get the nutritional breakdown. I love that I can memorize meals. I love the detail I get when I export. I love that my PC/iPad/iPhone are all in sync (most of the time)....LOVE this app and recommend it to anyone who needs something like this.
2573,2573,4,2015-10-10T04:32:27.000Z,CoraMackenzue,Useful tool,"I have type one diabetes and use this to look up carbs to calculate my insulin. It is really helpful and the library of foods and brands is vast. The only thing I wished were different is the way things are grouped (or lack of) once you choose the restaurant. Like all the drinks should be together, all the sides, etc. If you don't know exactly what something is named or you put it in in a way that isn't exactly as listed, you have to page through to find it. Otherwise it's the best app I have found for being able to look up nutrition information for so many foods."
2574,2574,5,2016-01-03T14:17:57.000Z,Forced to give five stars,Easy to use,This is easy to use which is great because no one wants to fight with an app. I like that it's tied to the website so I have a choice of how to access it. Love the bar scanner. Some improvements could be made. It would be nice to be able to see your food or exercise diary for over a period of time. Or if you can do that it should be easy to find. Also it would be nice to be able to customize some things you track for example I would like to track the amount of iron I eat. But other than that this is a great app.
2575,2575,5,2016-02-16T18:16:08.000Z,KuonHunt,Really works well for me!,"This app is really useful n easy to use. It will accept the barcode for almost anything. It gives all kinds of nutritive totals, so u can count whatever u want to, not just calories. I tell it how much u want to lose n it tells u how many calories to eat in a day, then keeps track of them for u easily n quickly. It also helps keep track of ur exercise n other activities. I've only been using it about a week (so haven't lost more than a couple of pounds), but I think it is super.  It tracks ur weight on a chart as well. Love it!"
2576,2576,5,2016-05-10T01:32:04.000Z,cornellspa,Outstanding weight loss app,"I must say I never used a fitness app before.  A friend of minetold me to try this.  I did and hve been hooked since the first time I tried it.  Since then, I have tried my fitness pal, and thd fitbit app.   I must say as far as logging calories, meals, etc, I find Fat Secret extremely user friendly.  It actually makes being healthy fun!   This app is the reason I am changing my life.  I just wish this app would sync with fitbit.   Otherwise I havd not a bad comment to make.  I love it.  Thank you to the makers of this app, you have changed my life!"
2577,2577,5,2016-06-09T17:50:55.000Z,Cepdance,Simple and easy,"I had been using this app for about a week and a half when I decided to try my fitness pal based on several friends recommendations. Right off the bat, my fitness pal overwhelmed me and I went right back to day secret. Maybe it doesn't sync with everything on my phone, but I like it's simple user interface. I'm also extremely impressed at all the food items in the database... Even my gluten free bread from my local bakery is on here!! Thank you fat secret for keeping it simple! I've lost 2 pounds in 10 days thanks to my accountability with this app."
2578,2578,4,2017-05-09T14:56:02.000Z,1wantch0c0l4t3,A must-have for calorie/macro tracking,"I find the app very easy to use. I decided to leave MFP and I chose FatSecret about 3 months ago after testing 6-7 different apps. Forget about the funny name, this app is a game changer. No ads, simple interface, and all the features you need for easy tracking of food, weight and even exercise (I don't use that feature, so I can't comment on it). The only thing that bugs me is that you can't scan bar codes when creating a recipe, so I tend to use the web version for this. I LOVE that every food can be entered in grams, as opposed to the tsp/oz/cups mess that was MFP."
2579,2579,4,2017-06-06T16:49:12.000Z,MommaCorrianna,Best I've used!,"It's a great app! My only issue is that sometimes when I pull the app up or use the website, it's on a different day and I end up logging food for a day in the past, which obviously throws off my numbers. Once I finally end up pulling up the real day I'm on, it's blank and I realize what I've done, but there's no way to see what day or days I've been adding food to üò≠ If there was maybe an activity log or something that shows the last few things I've added and to what day, that way I could go and delete them and put them on the right day...that would solve this problem!!"
2580,2580,5,2009-12-24T16:16:36.000Z,PGKutch,Great App!,"This has got to be the best app for counting calories, carbs, protein, weight or whatever!  The best thing is the fact that it has all the popular brands that one would actually be eating.  I have one request thou.  Being that I have an iPod with limited wifi access if you guys were to update the app and add the database to the internal memory it would make this app the only app worth getting!  You could charge $20 for this app and it would be worth it if you added the data base!  Without it iPod users are limited in many ways."
2581,2581,4,2011-04-15T14:39:41.000Z,Hoodrat81,Good app,"has a lot of potential but still not perfect.  It's really hard to balance your exercise time with what you're doing.  You have to reduce the amount of one activity when you add another...it's confusing.    Same with food...it might be easier to adjust how much food you've had if you can add it by amount (e.g. 1 tablespoon, 1 cup, etc.) vs. 1 serving."
2582,2582,5,2012-01-03T19:05:09.000Z,Brookeats,Fantastic!!,"This app is awesome, especially after using weight watchers' free app with limited functionality. It is not a weight loss plan, just a great tool for however you choose to track food, lose, or gain weight. I like that you can choose the nutrition info that is displayed as it relates to percent of daily calories (good for tracking net carbs on Atkins). Also, I've never searched for a food or brand that wasn't listed."
2583,2583,3,2013-11-17T12:22:15.000Z,Jennifer Berger,Latest update stinks!,"None of my data will sync on my iphone since this last update. And if it does, it takes several days!"
2584,2584,3,2014-09-26T02:32:50.000Z,Type1Runner,Used to Be Really Helpful for Watching Macronutrients,"I used this app all the time!  It's the easiest to use on a mobile device, if you're watching macronutrients for meals."
2585,2585,5,2015-09-16T19:42:34.000Z,Les M3,Intuitive and well stocked,"I used MyFitnessPal for quite some time, but I just like FatSecret way better. FatSecret does pretty much the same thing but it's more intuitive to me. I don't use any tracking tech (like FitBit, etc.) so I can't say how that would work. As a straight forward log, it's fantastic."
2586,2586,5,2016-07-17T02:02:10.000Z,Fatbitch55,Best Nutrition App Available,I've been using this app for years to track my nutrition and I couldn't be happier with it. I'm also a competitive bodybuilder and without this app it would be so much more difficult to track what I eat. This app has pretty much any food you can think of in its food inventory. And if if doesn't you can always add one. My fitness pal or any other nutrition app doesn't even come close to this app. I would highly recommend to anybody interested in fitness or for any dieting purposes.
2587,2587,5,2017-02-16T17:30:38.000Z,Cmiceli,Keeps Me on Track,"If you're looking for an App to help keep you on track, keep track of your daily intake, and be accountable to yourself, this is it! It's the perfect personal assistant for anyone trying to lose weight. It has all of the calorie information for thousands of foods, and it has all of the major restaurants, making eating out a breeze! The weekly weigh in also helps. It records your progress, so you can see how well you're doing and that helps to encourage you and keep you on track!"
2588,2588,5,2017-05-06T05:38:54.000Z,TNKS1,Great,Been using Fat Secret for almost one month and lost 3 lbs. but I work out running and weightlifting 3-4 times a week so I probably lost more fat than that. Living in Beijing so many european brands are not listed not to mention some of the asian food I eat so i do improvise a bit with my calorie counts. In any case this app really helps me stay focused and the results are showing. Hope the new update I downloaded will be as good. Anyone who is motivated to control their calories and keep high protein like me should try it!
2589,2589,4,2017-05-23T16:29:50.000Z,Anna from Ridge street,Good app,"It is a very helpful app. I have to google to find certain things on the app, things that I think should be easier to access. There is a home section where I see people leave notes for everyone to see, I can writes comments to their ""posts"", but I can't find how to write one myself (not badly enough to google it)) also I see people have profile pictures, at a first glance (and a second and a third) I couldn't figure out how to set one myself. But again, my main reason for using this app is to develop mindful eating habits, not to socialize."
2590,2590,4,2010-10-17T13:20:18.000Z,Eph91,"Love it, but ""fixed barcode issues"" ? Really?","I love this app. and use it daily (although some of the exercises to choose from are unclear, and I do think it overestimates calories burned both at rest and in some of the exercises), but I am wondering (and can't find any info. on the site) about the claim that the updates have fixed the barcode scanning problems. I have iPhone 4 and the scanner doesn't work.  I think I got it to work a few times before the update, but now it never works. I hope they fix this!"
2591,2591,4,2011-02-12T23:55:49.000Z,poppet9,"Very good, would like to see some additions","I've been using this for a few days to compare how I like it to tracking in WW and it's pretty good. Love the scanning feature, but need to get creative when you can't find something specific. Would be great if it had 1/3 cup selection, vs. just 1/4 or 1/2. The choices for exercise is pretty limited, would be nice to have a feature that allows you to put in time exercised and level of exertion to determine calories burned as opposed to guessing that ""cycling 15/mph"" is the same as a spin class."
2592,2592,5,2012-01-05T00:13:49.000Z,Nicole Dolge,Best calorie app I have come across,The barcode scanner is my fav part. I made a grill cheese sandwich today and just scanned what I used and put how much I used of each and bam grill cheese with my ingredients. I also used an recipe from here and I love it low in calories and had all the ingredients. Easiest out off all. I have not gave up on using it because it Is an in convince like others I have used. Great app.... Thank you for creating it will recommend to all friends. And post on my Facebook as my fav app...
2593,2593,2,2012-08-28T01:52:10.000Z,Christinymarini,Version 4,"I used to love this app and that is saying a lot since I have tried several different calorie counters on my iPhone.  Unfortunately, I don't like some of the more recent updates like the extremely tiny menu bar for recently eaten, most eaten and search when you are trying to add items. I always end up tapping the wrong thing even though I don't usually have that issue with other apps. I also wish the app had the option to put in decimals or at least 1/3 and 2/3 serving sizes as some of the other apps have. Positives are that you can change the columns of items you want to track and edit your own calorie ranges."
2594,2594,3,2015-06-09T19:04:41.000Z,LGMCCU,"Neat, but search option needs help",I have only used this for 3 days.  The search option brings up far too many results that are not even related to the search.  I searched for an item yester day and it brought it up...searched for the same item today...did not show up.  If I search for Jamaican I don't want to see Mexican or any other country's food.  Otherwise it is simple and easy to use.  It just needs some work done on the search option.  I'll give it 3 stars now and when the search option gets simplified I'll come back and give it 5 stars.
2595,2595,5,2015-06-10T00:22:35.000Z,Jmdoran,"Great, incredibly powerful","In previous versions this app was clunky. Nowadays its interface is smooth and easy to use. The real power behind it is the food database which continues to be incredibly extensive. If you want to keep track of your caloric and nutritional intake, as well as estimate the calories you burn, this is the best app on any platform for doing that."
2596,2596,5,2016-01-05T12:14:50.000Z,Blatkeyes,Excellent food log(ger),"This app is easy to use as far as logging food & exercise. Highly recommend for that purpose. I do not utilize the community/social networking feature at all, so I can't comment to that. Only suggestion (& this is because I frequently get my healthy recipes from this source) would be to input the recipes from skinny taste. It gets frustrating having to enter new recipes almost daily - would be great if they were already there! I know it's probably not easy task."
2597,2597,5,2016-01-15T02:17:03.000Z,Robthereview,Awesome app that keeps getting better,"I started using this app in 2012 and in 6 months lost 15 lbs in a healthy manner. I realized I was just eating too much. There are so many foods in their index and if you can't find one you can add it yourself. Provides great summary of calories for the month and exercise. You can also sync with it on line so you can enter from your lap top, iPad iPhone etc.  If you want to lose weight or just monitor your carb/protein/fat intake and more get this app! Super app!"
2598,2598,5,2016-06-10T01:52:43.000Z,Shy.tack,Does pretty much everything I want it to,"This is a must if you're trying to lose weight. I love being able to so easily adjust the serving size of a food to put in my calorie counter, and it's convenient to be able to upload my own recipes. Besides minor, minor fixes, this does everything I want it to and more. Ridiculous amount of features for a free ad-less app."
2599,2599,5,2016-11-07T12:59:04.000Z,GorgeousFaces,A happy lady,I fist downloaded this app about 7 years ago and I lost 40lb. Over the last two years I gained about 20 of those lbs back (not eating right and not exercising) so a few months ago I started back with working out and eating right but also started back using this app to help maintain my daily calorie intake and just as before I'm watching my lbs fall off all over again. I love this app. Wish it had more recipe options within the app but over all an amazing resource.
2600,2600,3,2010-07-24T16:08:03.000Z,fitness-junky,"Perfect, BUT useless on iPod when there is no Wi-Fi available!!","I really just wanted a simple app on my iPod to look up nutrition information for foods with specific portion sizes.  Initially, when I found this app, I thought I finally found the app to do this simple task.  However, then I discovered that this app only works when you are online.  If there is not Wi-Fi available, this app is completely USELESS.  What a bummer!"
2601,2601,2,2012-06-25T17:49:46.000Z,Girl8363893,Works ok--can be frustrating,I love this app in that it is easy to use to log calories real quick. I don't love that it freezes up when I try to use the barcode scanner. There are also some things that calories aren't accurate. I have to double look sometimes. I have also had the app freeze up and delete everything I had stored which is really frustrating because of all the time I put into it. There was never a way to get it to work again I ended up having to uninstall it and reinstall it. Very frustrating to lose all of that data!! :( this has happened several times.
2602,2602,4,2013-03-10T08:49:24.000Z,GobiasRecords,Most Extensive Database,"I've tried a few calorie counting apps.  This definitely has the best database. I wish weight tracker included the option for other stats (BF% in particular, which then opens up lean mass weight). Would be cool if, when you opened app,  it checked the local time, and had the current meal ready for input in place of ""recipes"" (i.e.it's 12‚Ä¶time for lunch), rather than tapping food --> lunch. Also would be neat if a user could check ""prefill lunch with salad X on weekdays"".  Best app for calorie counting, a few tweeks and it'd be unstoppable."
2603,2603,3,2013-09-15T16:06:43.000Z,SHN512,"Good, but not great","Downloaded this app thinking I wanted to switch from another similar app which doesn't have a label scanner. I would like this app better if in addition to showing the number of calories of each type (carbs, protein, fat) consumed, it showed the percentage of each (for example, 45% carbs? 30% protein, 25% fat), the second thing this app is missing is the ability to build a recipe. But the worst part of this app is the ads. They do not tell you that this app is ad-supported and there is no option to get rid of the adds, not even for a fee."
2604,2604,5,2014-11-13T23:49:20.000Z,Jwine18,Love this app,"I really enjoy using this app. It's simple to use and allows you to scan items for quick entry. My only complain is that of the 5 nutrients you can check to show on the summary page, you can't uncheck calories or RDI. As my goal is to stay healthy, not lose wright, I could care less about either of those. I would rather show fat, protein, sugar and fiber. Please change those categories so that you can customize as you want!"
2605,2605,5,2015-06-26T13:22:59.000Z,ClifRD67,Love the app!  Hate the name!,"I was recently diagnosed borderline or pre-diabetic.  Had to get control of my carbs:protein.  Purchased a diabetes specific app and HATED  it-too cumbersome!  FatSecret is excellent and free.  I have diligently used this app and lost 1lb per week - safely and slowly. I'm not to my goal yet (I've only been using this for 6 weeks), but I've made more progress with weight loss than any other program I've used.  Great app-I've recommended it to several friends and family members."
2606,2606,4,2016-03-23T11:46:28.000Z,Jakeher7,Great app helps to track all factors to fitness,Mostly easy to input data and retrieve data.  Could use improvements in some areas. 1. Adopting new foods (sometimes this is difficult or impossible especially with unique restaurant foods) 2. Adopting more kosher brands.  This has been a challenge because even after I have entered a food not on the standard list it often can't be retrieved.
2607,2607,5,2016-04-15T11:22:49.000Z,Jimfit17,Used for a month. Love it.,Excellent app for both mobile and laptop. Journaling can be a pain and I've used myfooddiary and myfitness pal. This free app has good features like MFD. easy to journal. I'm starting to use the challenges which are helpful. It takes a little getting used to to get around on the small screen but the more you use it the easier it is to get around. I don't usually do reviews until I use an app for a while. Give this a try and Enjoy.
2608,2608,5,2016-05-18T23:20:05.000Z,Benji78701,It Works If You Do,"Pretty happy overall. I've lost almost 12lbs in 16 days just jogging, counting/restricting calories, and some intense but brief weight training. Fat Secret makes the tracking part easy, letting me focus keeping my discipline up. This app pretty much proves that (for most people, most of the time) losing weight is mostly just math and will power."
2609,2609,5,2016-08-23T17:48:58.000Z,Gingerxj12,New to App - Great for motivation,"I have been using this app for only one month, but it is the first time in 2 years I have lost weight, kept it off and am 100% motivated to keep going! I am down from 190 to 170 and have completely changed the way I eat by using this app's nutrition features. I have also started slowly exercising using the exercise logs, so many options that I can actually do at my current weight and health. Thanks for the motivation!"
2610,2610,5,2010-04-01T10:48:24.000Z,Terry4u2,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP!!!,Loven it love it! THe greatest And most useful app I've ever purchased. To
2611,2611,4,2013-07-20T21:14:29.000Z,MrSaaadman,Excellent for food entries. Exercise part is awkward.,"I've been trying to work in the exercise that I do, but I find it too complicated having to figure out the at rest vs. sleeping vs. activity, etc... I would much prefer just to put in my calories burned and have the app figure out the remaining cals for the day. Similar to the quick add feature for entering cals for food.  The rest and sleep can be a feature to turn on/off if you like."
2612,2612,5,2015-06-16T13:43:28.000Z,rahwkin,Really great app,"I‚Äôve been using fatsecret for a week and I really like it. Easy to use once you take a little bit of time to learn short cuts and what it can do.  Very easy to input items. I‚Äôve actually lost 7 pounds in my first week using it and am significantly more aware of my diet and nutritional choices. Have also used app on my apple watch - while functions are limited, it‚Äôs a great way to add items that are in your regular mix of foods."
2613,2613,5,2016-02-16T03:49:12.000Z,Kimichangaz,In love,I am in love with this app! Def a huge diff w/counting/tracking calories. Keeps you motivated by keeping you alert in just how much you consume. Track your weight and save recipes or what you normally consume. Saves previously eaten meals and you can enter what isn't in there as well. Another reviewer stated it was glitchy and once in a while I do experience that but the pros outway the cons big time for me. This is my first calorie counter/tracker so I cannot compare.
2614,2614,3,2016-09-14T04:18:37.000Z,rhahn69,I wish I could give it more stars,"I really like this app.  It has a wonderfully supportive group to help motivate when you need it.  I love having the ability to scan barcodes to find products and the recipes and recipe builder is great, but you can only use the builder online. The one thing that would make this app fabulous would be the ability to sync with the website.  I use both because work doesn't have wifi but the app won't sync with the info I out in at the office.  I had to go online to finish out my day.  Super annoying."
2615,2615,5,2016-11-15T07:50:22.000Z,Saparot12345,Love it!,"I absolutely love the fact that I can write in products not found in the database and save them; including pictures (this is especially helpful when you are traveling in different countries and you can save whichever product you consume). Can save meals and recipes, and even share them! It's a great app for tracking macros as it summarizes your total macros for the day at the top, tracks calories burned and weight loss or weight gain progress!"
2616,2616,5,2017-01-07T17:27:16.000Z,No name57,"Used many different, but this out did them all","I have used many different apps, tablets, every kind of tracker out there ( well at least all I could find ) NOTHING has beat this one for ease and data base. I was a yo-yo dieter and now I can keep my weight off and enjoy life just by putting what I eat on my phone as I eat and stopping when I've reached my limit. Before I just guessed how much I had consumed ( not good ) I always went way over. This app is great."
2617,2617,4,2017-01-11T06:15:09.000Z,Frusty the Dog,Almost Perfect!,"This was almost perfect for what I needed. The interface is great, not a lot of nonsense, very clean, good data summaries. Needs a much better database of foods and the memory on the search function isn't as predictive as it could be. I don't mind adding the food items myself, but it would be better to have something as robust as the myfitnesspal database. Although, I have found a few inaccurate food entries on both apps. I guess double checking is just part of the process."
2618,2618,5,2017-04-25T14:44:13.000Z,JayeKaCee,Best diet help yet!,"I had lost 20 lbs using a national brand diet, then stalled at a weight for two months. I found FatSecret and still am amazed at the vast variety of foods listed here. I have been able to keep accurate records of calories, exercise and sleep, and found that in order to lose, I had to eat about half the calories the national brand diet recommended. I am actively losing weight and feeling better week by week. Bravo, FatSecret, and thank you!"
2619,2619,5,2017-07-03T21:26:15.000Z,lc3370,Best Ever,"The only thing that ever worked for Me; made me conscious of everything I put in my mouth, discovering then how not to waste calories on a Godiva Truffle and have lunch instead. Kept track of consumption throughout day knowing how to plan if going out to dinner without exceeding my set intake of 1200 cals."
2620,2620,4,2013-01-29T01:37:38.000Z,Fitness Doc,Overall great! Just a few minor bugs,"It's really wonderful and has the easiest, most user-friendly interface from all the ones I've tried. A few fixes that I've noticed in switching from my droid, there's no adjustment for a horizontal screen flip and when you're selecting portion sizes they don't scroll through them before you can select so it can be hard to tell if you're picking ""meat only"". ""Skinless"", or something else like that. Overall great though!"
2621,2621,4,2015-07-06T10:58:59.000Z,Work out girl 93,Good app for tracking calorie intake,"I like that I can be exact with calories by measuring food and not just by serving size.  It's easy to input home made options (once I use another website to figure out calories).  It does not sync with any exercise apps that I use, the barcode reader is not the fastest, nor does it always work.  Lastly, wish the color options were different - maybe I can change it but after using the app for 4 years I haven't looked."
2622,2622,4,2015-10-21T09:43:15.000Z,m regard q kazoo,Have used this for years,"I love this app. I have used it on and off again for the last several years and it is such a user friendly and helpful app for those trying to diet, keep track of intake values, or track weight loss/gain. I believe it was the most recent update that gave you the nifty pie chart of fat, carb, and protein percentages; how awesome is that? Before I would calculate by hand. This makes following a low-carb diet so much easier. I would highly recommend to anyone."
2623,2623,5,2016-05-31T21:33:08.000Z,Disgusted by Robb,Amazing,"Better than MFP, in terms of content. Maybe not as large of a database, and definitely not as user friendly, but it really does the job of counting everything and offering personalization (a personal fav is the daily calorie goals) without charge. Could be easier to navigate, and I would definitely like to see a place for notes."
2624,2624,3,2016-09-15T13:22:17.000Z,softailkel,Comprehensive and uncomplicated,"Current version has issues with what date it actually is; doesn't refresh quickly if I enter data from another device.  Otherwise, this app makes me want to throw rocks at every other system I've tried. Food lookups are fast and accurate with the barcode scanner, or the ability to add my own foods easily. All the right features for food and exercise tracking are at my fingertips, plus the nutrition breakdown (particularly macros and net carbs) really helps me see what to adjust. EXCELLENT app."
2625,2625,4,2016-10-23T14:49:43.000Z,Willie from Waco,FatSecret was just what I needed,"When I committed to loosing weight on a consistent, healthy schedule I went looking for an app to help me track my calories. FatSecret has been great to use once I got used to the many options. I wish it had a listing I could search of just the foods I have eat en instead of as it were the first time. It does let you search 'recently eaten' but recent seems to be too short for me. Thanks to the folks who make this service available."
2626,2626,5,2016-12-03T19:51:29.000Z,12341234asdfasdf,Love this app,"The hardest part of tracking all your health activities for me is ease of calculating food.  This app makes it super easy to measure calories or just what you eat.  In addition to that they have a great weight tracker, workout tracker and more.  Then to top it all off it does a great job of helping you visualize it all with great reports.  I was able to identify more easily where I needed to cut back on certain foods and at which meals.  I love this app."
2627,2627,5,2017-01-20T16:38:07.000Z,LALights,Best Weight Loss App,"For most of my life, I've been on and off diets. I've tried all the trends, many of the apps. This app is seriously the best I've used yet."
2628,2628,5,2017-01-25T14:24:08.000Z,OnlyMeMyself&Ruby,Fantastic!,"This has been a great help in determining if I'm burning more calories than I'm taking in.  It even allows you to enter the ingredients from recipes and the servings to determine how much calories, fat and protein your getting and save that recipe for future reference!  It's a great way to track calorie and protein intake as well as track overall exercise (not specific weight training sets) but overall burn.  I highly recommend :)"
2629,2629,5,2017-07-20T22:41:33.000Z,PaulieTheNorvegan,Best of the best,"I started out manually entering my nutrition and exercise in the diary. That was a good way to start because I could flip the pages back-and-forth to view the history. I tried my fitness pal and a couple of other programs before I found fat secret. Fat secret is by far the most intuitive program of it's type that I've used, simple yet quite informative.  This is the most used program on my phone."
2630,2630,5,2010-03-27T15:34:50.000Z,teejay93,Great app - extremely comprehensive food list,"I've been a WW lifetime member for 3 yr and track my points all the time.  This app is a GREAT food list resource - it gives points for all different foods (VERY comprehensive list), and my favorite part is that it will do various amounts of foods - i.e. 1/2c flour, 1.5 c flour, etc.  Handy for calculating points for my favorite recipes.  Also has a very extensive restaurant list, which is extremely helpful as well.   And it's FREE!!!"
2631,2631,5,2014-07-12T01:18:16.000Z,2721v,WOW,"I got this app late June and have already lost 13 pounds.   It's pretty easy to use.  Wish it had better ""recently eaten"" features.  If I have 31g of yogurt at breakfast I have to scroll thru and find the right amount if I'm using it at dinner. BLD&S should be just one big space, not so individualized.  My fridge and budget are only so big. If I buy a bag of carrots and hummus, I'm prob gonna eat that 8 times in 4 days, why make so many entries."
2632,2632,5,2015-06-27T10:37:44.000Z,Gybxdrgcsfxrfcfgx,Great tool,"I've tried a number of different tracking applications - this one is the definitely easiest.  I love that it easily tracks not only calories but macros, and that it breaks those down by meal.  The barcode scanner works really well, and if a food isn't in the database it's very simple to add a new one. I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants to start tracking their food and/or food intake."
2633,2633,5,2015-07-20T02:18:41.000Z,Suz's Six Foot In Heels,Love this nutrition tracker,"This AP is the best.  It is simple and easy for anyone to use.  I love the fact it has so many restaurant foods, even ones from the local companies here in Denver.   The vast listing of foods and ingredients makes tracking all the healthy meals I cook at home easy to do."
2634,2634,4,2016-08-27T03:16:47.000Z,paulasaunders,Good app.,"I really like this app. However, set-up with the confirming email and syncing between my iPad, iPhone, and laptop wouldn't always happen automatically. It was a little frustrating at first. Tech. Support Doesn't respond very quickly when emailing for help. The food list and measurements are excellent. Customizing my plan has been pretty simple to figure out. I have only used it for a few weeks, so I will update my review after I have used it longer."
2635,2635,5,2017-01-05T04:27:45.000Z,redcd,Great app. Has improved with Time!,"I got this app as part of buying some books to help learn how to eat right and exercise years ago. It works amazingly well and many new features have been added since. Love this app and all the improvements!  Keep up the good work!  And yes, I have lost weight using this app.  Find the books. Buy the books. Read the books. Highly recommended!"
2636,2636,5,2017-01-13T18:56:41.000Z,Joey1 Indiana,Better than others,I recommend!
2637,2637,5,2017-04-04T19:38:54.000Z,Mongo Wonder,Can't believe it's free!!,I found the FatSecret website first and thought that was pretty great. Then I found the app and love it even more. I really can't believe it's free.
2638,2638,5,2017-09-20T13:50:51.000Z,cheri LW,Love this app,"This app is easy to use, I love the visuals to track my progress and I love how easy it is to find food as well as customize entries for my own serving sizes. It has a great food memory feature that makes t easy to find foods I eat often. Highly recommended to anyone just getting started in their journey or anyone who just needs to get back on track and more accountable to themselves."
2639,2639,5,2017-09-27T16:26:38.000Z,Simplysavory,Tracking for the tracking resistant,"Fat secret takes all the guesswork out of tracking. From the barcode scanner to the seemingly infinite search capabilities, you WILL find the thing you ate. This is also coming from an exotic food enthusiast so you know I'm not kidding.  I love that you can break your diet down to the macro level even. Finally, I love that they offer recipes as well. It's one stop shopping for sure."
2640,2640,4,2010-07-25T20:42:38.000Z,Zane Tobin,Great App,"I really like the graphics. Very good looking app. I would have gave it five stars if the barcode scanner worked and I could keep track of vitamins and water intake. I have used other apps that do this but lack the large database of foods that this app seems to have. I also cannot figure out how to delete an exercise that I added for today. Can someone post how to do this? Also, where is a help file? Should the barcode scanner be working with iPhone 4?"
2641,2641,5,2011-01-05T00:38:05.000Z,PK32127,It,"I used another calorie counter app prior to trying out this one.  Now this is the only one I use.  It's much easier and intuitive and the barcode scanning feature makes it a snap to enter foods.  It's one of my most used apps.  By the way, missed this app a LOT during the temporary period where it was crashing.  The 2.0.1 version seems to have brought things back to normal."
2642,2642,5,2013-04-03T05:31:04.000Z,AlexSox,Excellent App,"This app is great to keep track of calories. Not only does it feature serving size, but you can change the number of servings you have and it will calculate that. It keeps a handy record of breakfast, lunch, dinner & snacks and you can use the iPhone cam to scan bar codes for food items not listed. And it keeps a record of recently & mostly eaten foods so you can add them to your diary quickly!"
2643,2643,5,2013-08-21T00:51:41.000Z,Trakkker,Very SMART app!,"As someone who is steadily and slowly trying to gain weight, and keep track of the protein carbs and fat intakes, this app is fantastic! I use it throughout the day, and before I even eat dinner I know where I am on my daily intake. So before the day is over I can tweak my last few hours' caloric intake.  For example, I just got done eating dinner and I need to eat another 235 calories (of mostly carbs) before I go to bed."
2644,2644,3,2014-05-26T21:14:55.000Z,laurkrav,Great but crashes a lot,"My husband and I are both using this app to track ourselves for weight loss. Overall, we really like it- great user interface and very intuitive. There are a couple problems: 1) IT CRASHES A LOT causing me to have to input things again; 2) the options for inputting exercise are inflexible- there are lots of options but it would be better if I could create some or just enter calories expended ( maybe you can and I just haven't figured that out - so maybe it's not THAT intuitive)."
2645,2645,4,2015-10-28T14:14:32.000Z,Keys lady,Better but one more thought,"Latest upgrade makes the app better, but still would prefer to have the summary total of consumed and remaining calories at the top of the screen, where you add food. That's the main info I'm seeking after food input.  Now I have to scroll to bottom of screen.  Would be better to move the fine detail info to the bottom of the screen for the folks who want that level of minutiae."
2646,2646,4,2016-05-21T17:02:43.000Z,PointBass,Really Useful,I use this every day. The app catches most of the popular/common brand names and is very accurate when comparing the calorie count to what the food packaging states
2647,2647,5,2016-09-08T17:09:21.000Z,R.S. Park,Mr.,"This is an incredible tool to monitor and track macros and exercise.  I have used this app almost every day for the last two years, and it keeps getting better!  I am a fitness trainer  and use the fat secret professional online service with all of my clients. Provides outstanding insight and accountability for the trainers and the clients. Great job! Make a professional app so I don't need to use my browser!!!"
2648,2648,5,2017-03-08T21:27:51.000Z,Jillann333,Best I have used!,This is a great app that has an amazing database. The only thing that would make it absolutely perfect: if you could input recipe info and get the nutrition data and apply it to your calorie count. Right now I have to use a separate app for that and it's rather inconvenient to have to transfer the data. Otherwise this app has replaced my weight watchers app which I have used forever. Love it.
2649,2649,5,2017-03-20T01:40:09.000Z,Lgbg0420,Love this App!,"I found this app 5 years ago and I loved it then and I love this app even more now. I lost 25 lbs the first time and maintained for 4 years. I love the food database and how you can add food, find easy recipes and save meals you eat all the time. It sometimes has problems saving foods to your daily intake but not enough to annoy me. I would highly recommend this app to keep track of your calories."
2650,2650,5,2010-08-27T16:24:35.000Z,Instupituous,This is the one you want,"Syncs with the website, iPad, and igoogle. Extensive, easy-to-add-to database. The barcode scanner is sheer genius. Can customize tracking for dietary needs (like sodium or fiber rather than only fat, kCal, carbs.) Tracks calories out. Easily adjustable daily calories-in target. I cannot think of a feature it needs to add, and the interface is wonderful. And it's FREE. I would pay $5-10 for this, easily."
2651,2651,5,2013-08-17T06:15:49.000Z,Druikje,Fantastic,"Fantastic app : easy to use, content. (Food lists), flexibility (add own food or menu or recipes). ."
2652,2652,5,2014-03-06T17:35:04.000Z,E dubs,Love this app!,"This is an excellent app to track calories if you are looking to lose weight, gain weight, or just monitor macronutrient intake! It is extremely easy to use - there‚Äôs a barcode scanner that allows you to scan in your food items with ease and there are even recipe ideas. As an added bonus, the online community connected by the FatSecret website is phenomenal."
2653,2653,5,2015-05-11T20:20:03.000Z,revuapp,Best food information app so far...,"I have downloaded 4 other apps and they all paled in comparison to this. I have yet to search for a food that it has not found. In fact, there are probably too many choices of the same food packaged in different ways. But that's not a criticism. The information is detailed yet easy to use. Use it all the time. It is excellent. Can't believe it's free."
2654,2654,4,2016-05-04T10:49:26.000Z,Garnacerous,Easy to use and helpful,"I've used this app to lose 20 lbs so far, and it's made the process so much easier. Almost all food I eat is in there (searchable by barcode too), and I can easily add anything extra."
2655,2655,5,2016-08-04T17:28:38.000Z,Nino1967,Greatest for Accuracy & Accountability,"This app will hold you accountable for every single item going into your body. The only way you will not attain your goals is if you do not use it or lie to it. I have lost over 24 pounds utilizing this app. The scanner and the saved meals make it easy to enter your data on a daily basis. I would strongly recommend to anyone trying to attain Health, wellness, and fitness goals."
2656,2656,4,2016-10-07T02:12:48.000Z,EPG2672,One Simple Request,"I absolutely LOVE this app. It's very simple, easy to use and tracks tons of great data, macro, etc."
2657,2657,5,2016-10-17T09:07:58.000Z,R.J. Sluman,Outstanding!!!!!!!,"This app is crucial to my daily life. I am in the process of trying to lose 100 pounds & knowing exactly what I eat is paramount. The app is easy to use, very comprehensive, and I see it being with me for my entire journey as I transition to a whole new way of eating.  Furthermore, the Fat  Secret community online is very supportive and a wonderful resource.  I recommend this app to anyone who is serious about their nutrition!"
2658,2658,5,2016-11-29T13:20:20.000Z,MSU4ever,Best App! Tracks net carbs!!!,"I started a low-carb diet for weight loss and health improvement. I've been looking for an all-in-one app that tracks not only carbs, but net carbs, too ... well, here it is! FatSecret beats all other apps by a long shot (the paid ones, too!). It's free ‚Äì no subscription or paid upgrade needed ‚Äì and syncs with iOS HealthKit and WatchOS. Plus, it's highly customizable to track what YOU want. Your search is over!"
2659,2659,4,2017-01-14T19:25:44.000Z,MarshmallowTreasure,Almost there..,I really love this app! I love how I can keep track of what I eat and the exercise that I do.
2660,2660,5,2009-12-24T18:26:21.000Z,"Long Islander, NY",Fantastic!,"Thanks to developer for making this application! I love how they set up and it's so easy. Before I go out to meet my friends last mins plan. I can look it up quickly on restaurant fast food chain i.e. "" Chili's "" and knew what I will be ordering for my dinner. It's very useful and help to cut down on bad fat stuff such as sodium killer and others hidden secret that we don't know. This is highly recommended."
2661,2661,4,2010-05-24T17:58:28.000Z,SlyGuy,Ads are in the way,"I am trying this after being fairly happy with Lose It. My biggest complaint so far is that the ad band at the bottom is so tall that I can't use the buttons at the bottom of the app. I'm not sure how often I will have to use these on a daily basis, but during the setup it was very frustrating. Yes, I understand the need for ads on free apps, but the ads should not interfere with being able to use the app."
2662,2662,5,2010-05-30T14:28:11.000Z,LindaO6,Sweet app,"I've reviewed several calorie counter apps and this us the best one. Easy to use, nice features, accurate, and convenient navigation. I can track my calories and carbs in one place, log my activity level, or quickly look up a food (including national, chain, or store brands) before making my decision. If a food is not on the very thorough list, I can add it myself. Love this app! Great job."
2663,2663,4,2010-09-03T07:05:57.000Z,F5er,Love it!!!,"The only thing I wish it had is body measurement tracking. When I'm not losing weight, tracking my inch loss is a great motivator. I love the simplicity of the app. I've spent quite a bit on fitness apps and this FREE one will be my favorite. Will still have to use another for inch loss thoughÓÅò   I really love that it has activities in addition to exercises, like resting, driving, sleeping. It's like having a bodybugg/gowear fit without having to pay the $200. Thanks !!!"
2664,2664,5,2011-08-18T18:33:54.000Z,Just me too.,Love it but could use some adds,"I really love this ap, it has an esthetically pleasing interface with the date and summary. A few features I would love to see are:"
2665,2665,4,2011-09-28T14:16:57.000Z,AngelaJoy69,Great app; excellent use & low crash rate,"I've used the website for this (fatsecret) for 6+ years. The app is a great addition, although I didn't sync it because I didn't want to lose my historical data. Not sure why it couldn't merge the two. The app is great for daily logging of food and goals. Would be nice if it had food group categories to slot food into though. Overall it's very good. Only crashes when canceling barcode scans."
2666,2666,5,2013-08-04T14:08:23.000Z,warneika,Great weight/food app tool,"I find this Fatsecret app very helpful for finding out nutrition info on a wide variety of foods and brands. The barcode, a great added bonus. Just punch in the barcode digits and it finds the item. I absolutely love that you can vary the serving size that you need, from the smallest of amounts to the number of servings, accordingly. A must app if wanting to keep track of all your weight/foodie needs."
2667,2667,5,2014-01-25T18:24:11.000Z,TerriGeo,Love this app!!,"I have been using this app for years and I love it!  I love how quick and easy the scanner for UPC's is. My only recommendation for an improvement would be able to add the time that you eat your meals/snacks and maybe add a body measurement section, that way we don't always have to rely on the number on the scale to determine the changes in our bodies."
2668,2668,5,2015-10-31T22:07:30.000Z,Traxy429,Best App Ever!,"I am on a weight loss program that, if you can believe it, does not have an App!  I have to keep track of my carb intake so when I was searching for an app to help me I found Fat Secret and installing feel in love! It has everything I need AND I enjoy using it, user friendly, has all the foods I am looking for, the scanner is wonderful and just love the format!!! Keep up the great work!"
2669,2669,5,2017-07-19T16:10:33.000Z,LELgirl777,Fat Secret,"Great app, very user friendly and love that it tracks your protein, fats and carbs. Great barcode scan to quickly add products. It works if you track! This app was recommended to me by my doctor and I highly recommend over the weight watchers app I was using prior to this app cause I have to pay attention to carbs, protein and fats as well as calories so I make better choices to stay in my range."
2670,2670,5,2010-07-15T14:49:44.000Z,Slenner,Great Program,"I am very happy with the functionality of this software and the support from the developer. It's superior to Lose-it, because of the  robust food database,barcode look up feature and the website community. my only suggestion is to add a daily goal and real time under/over status as compared to each person's caloric requirements."
2671,2671,5,2011-03-06T22:15:35.000Z,Dese34,Could not recommend higher.,"I'm down 100+ lbs while using this app. over the past 14 months. No way around the fact it works and it's flexible. I have it everywhere to keep it convienent (iPod, BlackBerry, Laptop, wife's Droid) so I have no reason not to keep up with the number of calories I'm consuming. By far the best app. I've ever used on my iPod, paid or otherwise."
2672,2672,5,2011-11-01T22:13:40.000Z,Calorie counter professional,I love this app! Better than ones that cost money,"This app is way better than the live strong app. My only recommendation would be to include more exercise options or at least more specific. For example elliptical as an option, instead of exercise machine. I love this application. They have the nutritional information of everything and every brand."
2673,2673,5,2011-11-03T13:26:08.000Z,LaurieLu1,So simple to use,I have been using this app and the website to track my calories/workouts/weight for over a year now and I really like it. I find it very simple to use which is perfect for me. I don't like a lot of unnecessary bells and whistles that i will never use. It is straight forward and I love how now they have incorporated recipes with the calorie counts already done. Really great app
2674,2674,5,2015-04-16T01:27:59.000Z,Ninjasteve1980,BEST FOOD DOC APP,"I live Fatsecret.  Whenever I need to lose weight or see what a serving of one of my recipes' nutritional info would be, I use Fatsecret.  I still like the full web version a little better, but the app is great when i just need to add food items quickly.  Takes some getting used to and time to enter new foods and recipes, but once they're in there, you've got 'em!  Great tool."
2675,2675,5,2015-10-03T02:21:07.000Z,Docinla,"Restaurant, brand and market sections are great","I have used my fitness pal and my plate and both are  excellent. BUT  I stumbled on this, yesterday had haven't really tested it. BUT to a first cut, the section on chains, supermarket, and brands is excellent and maybe more comprehensive than the competitors. Is certainly easy and quick.  Try it and you will probably enjoy it a lot for the simplicity The detailed food tables.  SIMPLE QUICK AND COMPREHENSIVE ESPECIALLY THE CONMERCIAL PARTS OF THE TABLES"
2676,2676,5,2016-09-06T20:33:24.000Z,Nikkiskippi,Wife and mother,I am glad that I downloaded fat secret. It's a great tool to see how to hit your caloric intake goals. Also Obama able to see trends and patterns in my eating habits that I might not see if I wasn't keeping track. For example I ate a lot more snacks which added quickly to my caloric intake. It helped me see the value in not eating fast foods and more at home meals. I am glad and support fat secret .
2677,2677,5,2016-09-18T17:34:01.000Z,AngieTM,Better than MyFitnessPal,"I have used my fitness pal and fat secret. Fat secret is easy and focused. It has The gif diary, weight and exercise tracker, reports, etc. The interface is simple, clean and clear. The new version of MFP is busy, it has too many distractions and too much extra stuff. I really like this app because it is helping me stay focuses on what's most important for my weight loss."
2678,2678,5,2016-11-07T14:42:02.000Z,prissywils,"Easy, Fast and very helpful","One of the few apps for weight tracking that makes complete sense and easy enough to pop in, search and record.  I'm truly enjoying the fact that most of the foods I eat include brand names and breakdowns of all nutritional info.  Thanks for this app.  I'm much more confident that I'm consuming and staying in check with my goals."
2679,2679,5,2017-01-18T16:08:20.000Z,ipodmama2,Net carb tracking,"Still the best app for tracking Net Carbs in my opinion, with no extra purchase to do so, or elaborate work arounds or tweaks."
2680,2680,4,2010-03-29T23:44:42.000Z,donnamm,wanting/wishing,"I love this program for its possibilities!  It is great as is, when it is not closing without notice, usually while you are trying to enter the food in your diary.  I do however, wish that I could do substitutions. (example.. hamburger helper-- we make ours with ground turkey and fat free milk, but the calorie count is as prepared with beef and skim milk. I also wish that when counting fat grams that I was able to view good fats vs. bad fats.  It lumps them all in together."
2681,2681,4,2010-04-12T15:29:36.000Z,Penny from Baton Rouge,wonderful app but . . .,"The scanner feature is wonderful, however it keeps crashing or timing out not sure what is going on but it is very frustrating to get kicked out right in the middle of inputting information. This is the only complaint I have otherwise the app is a wonderful tool to have. I will give it 4 stars but once the bug is fixed on the crashing it would be perfect."
2682,2682,5,2010-08-21T17:12:37.000Z,ph0t0g1rl2,Love it!,Love this app!  I haven't found a single restaurant or food choice that isn't in the database.  It allows you to type in the UPC if it can't read the barcode.  And it has found every food I've tried so far.  I love the diet diary!  You can set how many calories you want to net in a day and get a visual reference of how you're doing.  I would pay for this app- I can't believe it's free.
2683,2683,5,2011-09-14T17:26:12.000Z,"OMG, really??","Some issues, but hey it's free!","Downloaded a while ago, finally started to use it and I can't believe how GREAT it is...sure, barcode crashes, but I'm just happy it has that feature, I'm sure they will fix it...so far it has helped me tremendously for five days.  I can't afford weight watchers right now so this app is awesome for me!!  Plus I've hated points since they started them!!!"
2684,2684,2,2012-03-26T17:32:47.000Z,Tony-Daddy,Good App but.....,"I enjoy the features BUT it crashes or bogs down often, in the ""weight tracker"" section the ""goal weight"" won't change from the intial setting of 175 that I put in a few months ago. I have a new goal weight that I'm trying to achieve that's lower than 175. However, everyday when I weigh-in and input my daily weight and try to input a my new goal weight but it never takes. I emailed the operators  but no updates yet.  I recommend another App until this one gets updated.  Otherwise, it has potential."
2685,2685,5,2013-01-24T00:22:18.000Z,Abbylicious22,Best Calorie Counter App,"Very simple to use, easy way to track my diet and exercise. I've recommended this app to my friends. I wish they would add more exercise options, it's not bad or anything mostly everything is already on there. But I use the elliptical trainer everyday and its not on the list.  I use the ""other"" option instead. But it's been awesome so far!"
2686,2686,4,2015-07-08T11:18:39.000Z,BeccaHabegger,"Easy, convenient way to track progress!","I've been using this app now for five months, and it's easy and convenient enough that I can honestly say I've used it every day and incorporated it into my daily routine. Adding calories and exercises is fast and easy. AND it's free! Highly recommended. Not every brand of every food is stored in the app, but there's usually a good approximation for whatever it is you're eating."
2687,2687,5,2016-03-11T17:35:04.000Z,JoJi55,Very Helpful,This app is instrumental to my success in following the LCHF eating plan. I am able to keep carbs below 50 g per day and have even attained 20 g per day utilizing this app to plan meals and track progress. Love some of the low carb recipes too. This way of eating is so contrary to the last 30 years of advice for low fat diets that this app has been a major contribution toward my success.
2688,2688,5,2016-08-27T14:18:51.000Z,SD417,Awesome app!,"This app is awesome! It truly has helped me keep a diary of what I'm eating and helping me keep track of my macros! As I'm trying to build muscle, I know exactly how much protein I'm consuming in the day! I recommend it to anyone that's trying to keep track of their macros, loose weight and just hold yourself accountable for your nutrition intake! It works if you're committed! Oh...helped me loose 7 lbs too! üòÉ"
2689,2689,5,2017-01-09T13:35:51.000Z,Gameboy3000_53,Helping me lose weight...,This app is definitely helping me lose weight by allowing me to track my calories and see exactly what I'm eating throughout the day and adjust accordingly. It's amazing to see how much you actually over eat when you don't count calories...this app is easy to use and will help you achieve your goal if you stay consistent
2690,2690,4,2010-10-17T05:42:57.000Z,sarangdipity,It needs wifi connectivity :/,"OK, first, I've got to say this is an awesome calorie counter! I use it everyday. You can look up hundreds of foods, and if you can't find something, you can always add it to the app. One thing I don't like, is that it requires an internet connection! I really hate the fact that when your somewhere w/o wifi, it says ""Requires internet connection"" or ""Network timed out"". Please add an Offline Update?"
2691,2691,5,2012-03-29T03:46:23.000Z,Zymu,Pro version please,"This app has helped me to make a significant lifestyle change. For that it (they) have my endless gratitude. I would love a pro (paid) version which would include weekly, monthly, and yearly intake and output charts. The ads in this free app are very unobtrusive but a paid, ad-free version would be awesome!"
2692,2692,5,2015-07-17T13:22:19.000Z,Mardge the taco,"Best App, Worst Name","I love tracking my calories. It's really shown me where I blow it & has given me inspiration & motivation to continue eating healthy. I'm goal driven & this helps motivate me like nothing else ever has. Only small complaint is that I often cook from scratch & this is challenging to input correct numbers with those kinds of meals, especially if there's a lot of ingredients."
2693,2693,5,2015-10-06T09:54:23.000Z,ajl79nd,Great!,"I love this app. I was using MyFitnessPal for over a year but didn't find it as easy. When I started at a weight loss clinic in July, this app was one that was recommended to use. I loved it from the first time I used it. It's simple, tells me exactly what I want to see for each meal-ie carb count, protein grams. This makes it so much easier to see where I stand for each day."
2694,2694,5,2017-01-06T19:18:58.000Z,Ronald Quint,Really Good,"I have been using this app for about 2 weeks. It is starting to make me see my bad habits from eating and lack of sleep. It takes about 1 week of logging everything so that you develop a view of your eating and exercise, and sleep routine. I plan on using this app everyday to help me reach my goal of losing and maintaining my target weight."
2695,2695,5,2017-01-21T19:53:54.000Z,Vonnnna,Easy and Functional,"I love this app, so much that I had to give it a positive rating (which I rarely do). It's so simple to track my meals, weight, and even exercise. I love the customizable database where i can choose which macros I want to monitor. Also the ability enter information via barcode is super convenient. I would recommend it to anyone."
2696,2696,5,2017-02-10T17:03:46.000Z,Mullattamix,So helpful!!,I never have been very big on diets but I also didn't realize how much I eat how many calories over what I need that I eat this app just help me realize how unhealthy I was eating and I'll actually pause before eating something and look at the back and type it in to see if it's going to put me over for the day so awesome I love this app
2697,2697,5,2017-04-22T13:52:50.000Z,Lydia314,Keto/Macro friendly,"I was looking for an app that I could input my macros into, I tried at least 4 other apps and none of them include everything that FatSecret does! MFP is supposed to, but it is not as user friendly as FS is, I easily modify my macros to my weight loss in order to keep me on track.  I've been using this for 4 months now and couldn't be happier üòÄ."
2698,2698,5,2017-08-09T12:51:59.000Z,Meresunshn,"Fastest, easiest and BEST!!","There are so many apps out there to journal your food, exercise, etc. Fat Secret is so easy to use! The best part is that you can immediately see how many grams of carbs, protein and fat you have consumed for the day. Once I hit my carb limit, then I stop eating. Also, just scan your food as you are preparing it so it makes journaling fast, easy and fun!!"
2699,2699,5,2017-08-17T04:13:56.000Z,starzineyes,Gets the job done,"For me, the secret to losing weight is remaining aware of my intake. I was using another app, but they got greedy, LOADED it with ads and asked too much money to make them leave. So I dropped that one. Didn't use one for a while ‚Äì gained a lot of the weight back. Got this one, works just as well as the last one. I hope they don't get greedy."
2700,2700,5,2011-10-30T10:17:03.000Z,SpiffyKeenCool,Awesome App!!!,"It's one of the few apps I had to have when I converted from Blackberry to iPhone. Best of all, it's even easier to use on iPhone! All my data even came with me through the sync feature, which syncs across devices and the website, so no matter where you're inputting data, you're always up to date!"
2701,2701,5,2014-10-18T15:08:19.000Z,Ruth Dunton,Amazing accurate,"The ""Fat Secret"" application is the best I've ever seen. It have every single food and brand in its extensive database allowing for complete Accuracy when logging food & activity. You won't be disappointed in downloading it. Thus far I've lost 5 pounds in two weeks from tracking and logging my meals. I highly  recommended it."
2702,2702,5,2015-09-06T17:08:20.000Z,Starrparty,Great app to track calories,"I used to use MyFitnessPal, but found I had to upgrade to premium to do what I was able to do before for free. FatSecret is easy to use and has a large library of food and exercise making it easy to track. I've already lost 6 lbs toward my goal, and this app has definitely helped."
2703,2703,5,2015-09-07T18:11:02.000Z,Hereiwoz,What an amazing app!,This app has truly helped me change my lifestyle and track my healthy eating.
2704,2704,4,2015-09-18T00:05:34.000Z,Kelly45678,"Pretty good, few complaints","Simple, clean, to the point. I love it. My only complaint is that the fractions and units available to use aren't as user-friendly or precise as I'd like (Can't type in decimals, have to use drop-down list of fractions, but only 3 fraction options available. And for some foods, the only unit is 1 serving. So instead of entering that you ate 5 crackers, you have to say you ate half of one serving of 12 crackers.)"
2705,2705,4,2015-12-03T16:52:29.000Z,Glyciops,Great little diet app,"I've used Fat Secret off and on for over 4 years and like it a lot. It's great for tracking your diet, exercise, and weight. I use the app to maintain a diabetes-healthy diet and to track my daily carbs. I like how Fat Secret partners with the Apple Health app to track all kinds of things."
2706,2706,5,2016-01-10T19:32:40.000Z,Bkuzel,Great for tracking key stats,"I mostly track weight, calorie intake, and calorie output. From that perspective it is a fantastic, easy to use app. I love being able to scan the barcode of packaged food. Entering a home made meal from whole foods is more time consuming but still a simple process. I'd love to see the food library expanded even more."
2707,2707,5,2016-02-16T12:25:35.000Z,Susyqb59,SusyQ,Enjoying this app. Very simple and easy to use. It has all the basics that you need to get started toward your goals. It really puts you in check on what you're eating and what a true serving size really is! When you start keeping track is when you realize how much you consume on a daily basis. I would deff recommend this app.
2708,2708,5,2017-03-07T13:31:18.000Z,Saxynails,Excellent,"Love this app just about anything you can think of regarding food is in their database. Simple and easy to track your meals. Only things I could think of that would make the experience better is more types of tracking i.e. BMI, body measurements, and A simpler way to make your own recipes to store them for future use."
2709,2709,4,2017-05-15T14:03:15.000Z,Hdibsjzhsisbd,Needs flexible name/number of meals,For the most part I like this app. Personal trainer had me download it so she could track my progress. I work an odd schedule and I eat breakfast at lunch or dinner at breakfast time. I would like to have the option to rename the meals to times like myfitnesspal. Or even to add more meals besides B/L/D and snacks.
2710,2710,4,2012-03-28T16:07:04.000Z,Sgerken,Suggestion,I really like this app and all of the options. For the list of exercises you should really add a yoga and stair option. Thanks also I was keeping track of my breakfast and I had sausage links I had 1 and 1/2 and you have it in there as 3 for the serving size and no way to adjust now I have to remember to knock off 130 calories because I didn't eat the whole serving size.
2711,2711,3,2013-11-25T13:35:44.000Z,M4schler,Latest updates downgrade app,Doing nothing to software is often better than doing something.  Such is the case with the latest update. Spin wheel choosers are almost unusable.  Look and feel are not intuitive.  This app doesn't have to be pretty- it HAS to be functional.  I really liked the old look and feel.  If you must change for iOS 7.0.x at least change in favor of usability and content.
2712,2712,5,2014-06-01T19:02:33.000Z,thecutestnightmare,Why isn't this more popular?,"I love this app so much. It's more user friendly than myfitnesspal, it has an easier to find and larger food bank than lose it. The exercises could be expanded but it's easy to find something in the same calorie burn range if you don't do a normal workout. I recommend this to EVERYONE."
2713,2713,5,2015-07-08T13:26:26.000Z,Tyla k,Best counter I've used!,"I have used all kinds of different apps to count calories and different ones to record my work outs! I love that this one does both!! I have yet to find something I don't like about it! It's easy to use, I have used it everyday since I started watching my diet and doing more exercising! Love, love, love this app!"
2714,2714,4,2016-05-18T19:16:05.000Z,Bloodline 4,"Good app, but with one flaw","This app is great, easy to use, and simple. The only problem I have is that the in-app RDI calculator is pretty terrible. It estimated I needed to eat about 2800 calories a day to lose weight; I checked with other websites after about a month and found out my RDI to lose weight is about 1400 calories. So pretty big flaw for someone who relies on using the in-app RRI. Besides that problem it's a great app."

2718,2718,4,2017-03-14T14:13:31.000Z,Jdlenshjqbt,Great app for tracking progress!!,Love all the foods they already have in the database. Really makes logging foods so much easier! Would love to see them give you the option to set your macros at target numbers instead of only setting calories - would help with Atkins and Keto diets as well. Overall the best food and weight tracking app I have been able to find.
2719,2719,5,2017-04-02T18:36:04.000Z,KinkyWhisker,Best way to keep track,"Fat secret had always been my go-to place when it comes to dieting and keeping track of your weight. Unlike other weight trackers, fat secret actually has a huge selection of name brand foods and stuff people actually eat so you are able to log pretty much anything you eat."
2720,2720,3,2010-02-26T02:12:59.000Z,Actuizzle,Not a Flexible Platform,"I liked this app a lot until I tried to add some food from the cafeteria at work. I don't know any information for the food (it's from the salad bar) so I have to guess. It's impossible to enter this food into the journal! You have to know exactly how many calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat are in the food or you can't record it. I don't know! I just want to guess the calories. Try Lose It! That app is more flexible."
2721,2721,5,2011-07-26T02:05:16.000Z,123983tf,How this app works for me,At first i added this app and lost 28 lbs but i figured it was just me since i felt like i never really used the app. So i deleted and ever since then ive stayed the same weight and i was like honestly what an i doing wrong. But after that i added the app again and lost 10 more lbs so i believe the app works for me!
2722,2722,5,2011-10-31T16:02:05.000Z,Klaw60,Indicator bar,This is an awesome app. It would be cool of the app incorporated a indicator bar much like one that tracks cell min history thought a month. Only this indicator would track your caloric intake daily. I am trying to gain weight and It would be really nice to see my progress  throughout the day to see if I'm ahead of my target or behind.
2723,2723,5,2014-09-26T13:52:38.000Z,kiddler,AWESOMENESS!!!,This app has been absolutely essential in being a part of my 80 lb + weight loss! It is easy to follow and track and has such a variety of foods. The scanner works great and the whole interface is fun to use. I actually look forward to when I can next record! Thank you so much for such an excellent app!

2725,2725,4,2015-12-30T02:45:32.000Z,Coastie1772,Decent,The app is pretty user friendly. I'd like to see servings in decimal instead of fractions. Also I'd like to see much more of my weight history. I've been using this app for almost 5 years now and have a lot of data that id like to export to other apps. All in all it's pretty good but there's much more I'd like to see. I'll start looking elsewhere until they integrate health kit.

I can keep track of what I eat and how many carbs I consume. I really love that it shows restaurant menus so I can plan what I'm able to eat before I get there, including the carbs and sugars. I would highly recommend this app."

This app is great. I'm able to even search for the nutrisystem meals and they're all in there. I love being able to track fat grams and calories as well as other nutrients. I like it!

I recommend it

However, there seems to be a bug with the barcode scanner; it'll scan the UPC (or I type it in), it'll pull up the info, then freeze. It doesn't matter how long I've waited thinking maybe it just processing data, but it stays stuck. Fix that and it'll be 5 stars, hands down."

Lots of buttons and confusing layouts. Don't like switching between diet and exercise calendars. The calorie tracker doesn't calculate what I think my RDI is. Ad's are annoying. Online sync is cool but not great. Love the huge online DB of foods. Barcode scanner is a great feature but it crashes the application! LoseIt is another great free application but it's missing the barcode scanner and massive online food library.
2732,2732,5,2010-10-23T02:03:12.000Z,legendarydragon,Mostly Great,I love the app. I enjoy the tracking. I really like that it syncs up online so my other iProducts are up to date. I like the exercises tracking. I'm bummed that the barcode scanner doesn't work for me. I just input the number by hand and all is well but it could save some time and frustration.

Has helped me track my daily intake/output as closely as possible for months now.  It can't help you lose weight or gain size or strength by itself, but it certainly can help you keep yourself on track. Highly recommended."

Please help fix it, I don't want to switch to another program."

I am sure I will continue to finds more tools to help me make good food choices with this app. After first week using this app with its RDI appearing very generous compared to WW. I have lost 2 lbs. I hope that I can continue eating healthy portions and make it a habit towards a healthier life.

I love the fact that it brakes down everything. The only thing in think would be great when breaking things down, would be the ""Sugars"" or ""Sodium"" cuz when you train for specific goals would help a lot."

PLEASE add this and update"

I highly recommend exercise but I swear 80% of the battle is what you put in your body. I'm now back to lifting weights to gain muscle which will help maintain my body weight. Great app to keep you motivated and on track!

But it's not perfect: I think it's a few too many clicks to get to your saved meals, and the app is flat out wrong about some of it's nutritional info(plain brown rice does not have 400mg of sodium!). But all in all, it gets the job done, and well."

Extremely useful when it did work."
2761,2761,4,2015-09-20T02:44:33.000Z,Keedybooboo,Changes,The app will not let you change a meal from one day to the next and it was better when you could move things around through the meals and also not being able to see what you have for lunch to use it for breakfast or dinner makes it complicated also
2762,2762,4,2015-10-23T17:03:37.000Z,Froggychk,Love it,Love how you can track everything. The way it displays it all. The only reason I gave it 4 stars because there is not enough tracking for the fitness. Like it doesn't even have logs for push ups. Other than that it's way better than the other apps. Love also you can make groups and challenges.
2763,2763,4,2016-02-28T16:19:37.000Z,CourtneyB23,Amazing App,I am in love this app. I love how it takes all of my intake and breaks it down so I can see my macros. It's super easy to use and navigate. The only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is that for some of the restaurant items you can't go in and take out things you excluded to show your true caloric intake.  Other than that this app is awesome.
2764,2764,5,2016-03-21T23:37:26.000Z,Kitty-t,Simple to use,I used the website before I had a smart phone years ago. There's just something about the simplicity of this app & website that kept me using it. I like how I can display the net carbs which is great for people counting carbs but get tired of subtracting fiber from the amount.

Its all about what you do for yourself and input it into this app. It doesnt do the work for you, except calculate your results.

Little 'bugs, but app very useable."

2784,2784,5,2016-06-20T12:10:07.000Z,RvaKatie,So easy to use,"You can save meals that you eat more often, and a lot of things already come up with a barcode. It's been weeks and I haven't gotten tired of entering everything I consume yet because it's not a headache to do it. Love this. It's been extremely helpful."
2785,2785,5,2016-12-01T17:16:24.000Z,Namaste Ubuntu,Works great!,I exceeded my weight loss goal and lost 5.6 lbs in two months using Fat Secret. I'll continue to use for some additional weight loss and I really enjoy how much more mindful I am about what I eat. I find the app easy to use and I really like the calendar and calorie average features.
2786,2786,5,2017-03-10T22:55:01.000Z,Madchad6969,Very Useful,"I just started counting my macros, I tried doing so on my note pad and just doing my best at calculating it. This app simplifies the process. Using this app I have lost 16pds and I'm still losing because I am able to keep track of everything I have taken in. Thank you!"
2787,2787,5,2017-04-02T21:24:54.000Z,CrittersMama,LOVE FATSECRET APP!,"This app has helped me lose 22 lbs. I use it faithfully daily. It is so nice to be able to plug in a food, and it is almost always already listed in the program. I also love the Recently Eaten Foods (list that I eat frequently). I now have the app loaded on my iPhone, iPad & laptop. It syncs everything between the 3."

2789,2789,5,2017-05-30T16:03:15.000Z,Jstafford89,Almost perfect diet log!,"Great app! Really functions well with a nice and clean layout. The food is easy to look up and add, and the breakdown of different many different stats really helps to keep dieting on point. If only it could track more vitamins and minerals... (future update maybe??)"
2790,2790,4,2010-06-03T17:20:10.000Z,Mdamont,LOVE IT!!!!!,Was using Lose It and I was having to enter alot of the foods into the app.  Deleted that app when I found this one. This app has more in it's database than any other app I have looked at. You do have to have more than just calories when entering a new food but it is not hard to find.
2791,2791,5,2012-01-12T18:28:47.000Z,Gavkamal,Love it!!!!,"Love this app! I can plan a whole day and know where I am for calories and makes me more accountable. Also by having my meals planned out, I avoid making poor choices! Love the barcode scan option and also the variety of recipes. Highly recommend it!"
2792,2792,5,2013-09-27T01:39:13.000Z,RickM837,Best app for bulking/cutting,"My workouts were always in place. Keeping in track of calories was hard until I came across this app. Definitely the best download. Has all the foods, from restaurants to create your own. A must have for goals with serious fitness!"
2793,2793,5,2014-10-09T15:17:49.000Z,QueenRach,Yes!,"I really enjoy this app, the features are great. I think some notifications to remind me to enter my food would be helpful, I am terrible at remembering. Also, the app crashes sometimes which bothers me, but I really do like how the app works if it was smooth running every time."
2794,2794,4,2015-03-05T04:15:37.000Z,heyladybug,Love this App,This app has a lot of the local restaurants which is very helpful. One thing that I would love to see soon is the ability to enter a custom calorie number for food that the app doesn't have. That way I can look it up somewhere else and enter it into the app so that I can still keep track of my day.
2795,2795,5,2016-05-21T11:40:32.000Z,jghent54,Easy to use! Lost over 20 lbs so far.,"This app is very easy to navigate. I like the functionality of it. Inputting multiple food items is a breeze. Allows me to keep track of calories, exercise, and see with the monthly calendar how I'm doing. Thank you."
2796,2796,5,2016-06-17T02:10:55.000Z,_shadowylady_,Better than fitness pal!!,Very accurate and thorough. Makes it easy to track your macros based on your specific diet needs and goals. Doesn't sync up with Apple Watch activity but can easily be logged in manually. Still a very enthusiastic five stars!
2797,2797,5,2017-01-02T15:42:14.000Z,Ambs 01 25,Amazingly Effective,Tracks foods and progress easily without needing to pay for upgrade. Easy to use and includes a database of many foods and brands you would normally eat. Anything else needed you can add yourself and it only takes a minute or two.
2798,2798,5,2017-06-23T14:39:49.000Z,peach boy,It has a macro counter!!,"Love this app!! So easy to use, navigate, and adjust. I love that you can watch your macros bc I'm carb cycling. You can even adjust your daily levels of protein, fat, and carbs. I love the layout and it has a zillion foods. Not sure about international fruits and veggies, but its ever-expanding! Get it!! Use it! Love your body!"
2799,2799,5,2017-07-30T10:07:26.000Z,Ironmanlou,Really Helping,Keeping me disciplined and honest. Had a binge and after I saw how many calories I had just done it will help me stay strong next time. I wish it had a favorites section that I could store items I eat every day is all I would add. Highly recommended.

I ignore the ads at the bottom, but it really shouldn't be political ads. My only problem is I can't change my goal weight. It will let you change it but won't store the change."
2801,2801,5,2011-09-22T01:09:33.000Z,394mm493,Great app,I've been using the website along with the mobile app for a while now. Having a quick and easy way to log my meals and my exercise has been invaluable in helping me reach my fitness goals. I would highly recommend it.

2803,2803,3,2016-07-04T13:48:16.000Z,MontyWolfe,Great app but a little flawed,"I love this app. It's real benefit is that it makes me aware of what I am eating. By inputting everything I eat, I have become knowledgable about which items are problem items (fried foods in particular).  My only issue is with the portions. Often, the only options are in grams or some weight - and I don't have access to a food scale while I'm out and about."
2804,2804,5,2016-09-13T17:11:16.000Z,Glitter freak,Love the community of this app,I have been using this site in general for 6 years and I love it. It is amazing to see how far they have come with their app! The community of people there are so kind and helpful. It is awesome to see my weight fluctuations and patterns between being pregnant and not.
2805,2805,5,2017-01-14T16:48:07.000Z,Artist506,Love this app,I was told to use this app to track protein and carbs. Didn't use it. Weight loss hit off yo slow start. Started using app and discovered high calorie intake. Tracking everything now. Weight is starting to come off. Really enjoy using it. Very easy to use.
2806,2806,5,2017-04-09T10:52:40.000Z,Inervating_halo,Super Tracker!,"Easy to use, easy to program and easy to gather information at a glance. The key features of this app is that you can program your macro intakes for the day, or judge your log by daily allotted calories. I would recommend this app over any other diet tracker!"
2807,2807,3,2017-07-13T14:34:35.000Z,JehyT,Come a long way,"The app has come a long way since its inception. It has a lot of new great features and a slick new design. I think the barcode scanning feature needs more work and the ""most eaten"" tab generates inaccurate data. I also would like to see the data for ""recently eaten"" go further in the past than, say, the last 10 things documented."
2808,2808,4,2017-07-27T13:07:09.000Z,KnightsSCR,Easy and quick,"It doesn't take much effort to log what you intake daily.. the hardest part is making sure the combination of foods fit your macros! The app is helpful for tracking weight and has almost all the foods I eat on a regular basis. Even when it doesn't, it's quick to enter in the necessary nutrients."
2809,2809,4,2017-09-01T13:28:32.000Z,Poshathome,Wonderful and helpful app,"The app isn't perfect by any means but it gets the job done for me.  One has to remember the purpose and intent of the app. I only wish I could monitor time of meals or have a self-set reminder. I don't want a separate app for that, but it's important for some to keep to a schedule.  I love that I can keep a photo log of my intake."
2810,2810,1,2011-06-07T02:20:36.000Z,Dreamgirlknows,NOT USER FRIENDLY!,"Too Complicated,  I was using ""Lose It"" but wanted to try another app with more features. For instance; How do I add to ""Saved Meals""? I keep hitting ""Save"" everywhere I can, yet when I go to ""Saved Meals"",  it's not listed! How do I copy food from my Diary, I still can't figure that one out!  So dang frustrating! I wish I could see what the calories are based on what I've eaten before I save it. It's just not user friendly at all, thank goodness it was free! I give up, it's taken up too much of my time already... Too bad!!"
2811,2811,1,2014-09-26T04:27:39.000Z,Vugainz,Iphone6,New update works but it's more difficult to use. Under restaurants there's no more categories like dessert or steak or chicken etc. Under column it doesn't allow you to change rdi and calories. The old version was a lot easier to use because you could simply swipe left or right to go back a day or forward a day now you have to use some wheel to pick dates and the date on the wheel is off too...so much hope for this but was completely let down
2812,2812,5,2015-06-25T15:23:36.000Z,Sandboxjunction,Success !,First app that has  helped me lose since I've turned fifty. Easy to track calories weight and activity. Doesn't make you blow diet even if you've had your cheat. Just allow for it in your daily intake and you stay on track!

Cataloging your intake, exercise and weight will, if you are diligent, will certainly keep you aware of your progress. I can review past history record and confirm success or adjust for the future. Excellent app."

Calories and energy expenditure are easy to track, and updates make the app more and more user friendly. I regularly recommend Fat Secrets to my clients."
2815,2815,5,2016-02-20T15:31:54.000Z,Mikec2s,Fat secret is awesome,"This app is great for tracking food intake. If you are trying to lose weight or put on lean muscle mass this is a great tool for you. It is simple to use unlike other calorie counter apps, and puts u in control of your diet. The scanner for barcodes is great and saves time searching for foods."

Love this program, there hasn't been a good item I couldn't find in the SEARCH. I really like this app and would highly recommend it to anyone who needs a convenient way to set goals and keep track of intake."
2817,2817,3,2016-05-03T02:56:01.000Z,gamel0ver42,Not quite there yet,"I really like this app a lot e.g. the awesome barcode scanner that also allows number entry. There's also a few things that could be better. First the fractions list for each item needs more increments like 1/8, 1/3, 2/3 etc. Also goals for individual macronutrients, remove items from search history or clear it. The recipe description should be optional."
2818,2818,4,2016-05-29T12:23:24.000Z,Jiffn,Great Simple App With Few Flaws,I've been using this app for years and it has been the best calorie/fitness counter I have used.
2819,2819,4,2017-07-16T12:57:42.000Z,Amyhon,Always a Good App,I have used this app on and off for a couple of years.  I have tried other apps as well and this is more intuitive.  I highly recommend it if you are looking to lose weight.  It really helps me to see where I am spending my calories and I can see when my ratios are off.
2820,2820,3,2011-12-30T17:49:50.000Z,Renel,Notes on weight tracker has bug,I use the app primarily as a daily weight tracker. Nice to be able to see progress over time. However there is a bug in the note function. Notes tend to show up as duplicates for past entries in effect wiping out old entries. Makes the notes function pretty useless. Looking for a new app with a note function that works.
2821,2821,5,2013-10-28T00:27:55.000Z,Chrusso,Great app,My husband I have both been using this app. He loves it for traveling and choosing meals in restaurants. I find the barcode reader and the food database very helpful. We both have lost weight using this app to track our food and will continue to use it.
2822,2822,5,2015-05-23T16:25:16.000Z,PhotoDan,Works Great for Me,I have been using the Fat Secret app on my iPhone since February and have lost 20 pounds in four months. I have discovered the recipe portion of the app and look forward to creating some great healthy meals. I told my doctor about Fat Secret and he recommended his staff check it out.

2826,2826,5,2016-11-14T20:26:48.000Z,GmasAngel,Great App for me,"We cook a lot at home, so I love that I can enter our recipes and track my daily nutrition.  It's also easy to add ingredients that aren't in the database.  It remembers what I ate lately, since I'm a creature of habit (when I find a recipe I like, I eat it frequently!) it makes journaling my meals a breeze!"
2827,2827,5,2016-12-20T13:45:20.000Z,Thorkild,Simple and effective,"This is a great way to track macronutrients, caloric intake, and have a general idea of energy expenditure. The app is simple enough to use regularly throughout the day which is important for compliance. I would highly recommend it for any of my athletes or friends."

Has tons more foods than other databases,  easy to use, has running totals at top of screen, (doing low carb so this is fab) doesn't throw in your face how much you have left to eat (which always bugged me) really happy with app. Will give 5 stars when updates for IOS"
2831,2831,5,2015-05-12T23:02:36.000Z,JimmySwansea,Fabulous,"This is the easiest and most comprehensive food/calorie app I have used. It is surprising how many calories you eat unnecessarily if you don't keep track. This has helped me lose 45lbs so far, and I'm sure will help me with the last 4lbs I have left to lose. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

It is so user friendly and I really believe that tracking what you eat is the big secret to weight loss and maintaining your weight. Tracking calories on your smart phone really works!

Food and restaurant database is huge, and I love that it has a scanner. My only suggestions would be to add a carb limit (unless I'm just not finding where).  Awesome support too!"
2835,2835,4,2015-12-16T03:41:22.000Z,RIPin@,Very useful app,It's really help people to become more healthy and stronger. There are some issues with iOS and Web apps such as you cannot copy food from previous day on today. iOS app loose stops normally working when internet connection lost. But still this is great app and service

It gives you an immediate reading of number of carbs consumed for each meal which is vital in insulin injection. App is easy to use and works great with the Heart app on iPhone."
2837,2837,5,2016-03-29T17:36:45.000Z,AngryBowler,Really Helpful App,This app as been really helpful in tracking my food. It's has made me think twice about some of my food options. I find my self looking up some foods before I order so I will know about the calories and the sugar content.

I'd say figure out your macros first though, then use the app to help on the log of your diet. The app was a bit off with my macros just based on my height and weight."
2839,2839,5,2016-10-28T23:21:59.000Z,Necrotix,Awesome!,"Way better than any paid app I've found. Far easier to put in a bunch of food at once to make a meal. When adding food, to scan barcodes, there's a camera icon at the bottom center. I didn't notice it initially. Fantastic app!"

Other than that it's a good program."

Also, when trying to add food, some of the menu selections are too close together (such as search, recently eaten, and most eaten) making it very difficult to select that item."

When I change the quantity of the food selected the app just closes itself. It times out a lot in the middle of searches and the barcode scanner doesn't work very well. Also, it has not been adding the calories up properly. When I open each food item the calories listed are correct but the total is incorrect."

Too, and this is a big one, it needs a water counter. I must make sure I drink my 8 glasses of water a day, and this app. doesn't help me with that. Otherwise, really love it."
2847,2847,5,2016-07-15T19:03:20.000Z,Duo addict,Fat (no) secret!,Got to love Fat Secret!  It is the easiest food journal I have ever used.  It keeps me accountable and for me removes the feeling of deprivation.  I eat every kind of food and keep portions in check.  When I reach my daily calorie limit I just stop eating!  Of course it requires a little common sense.
2848,2848,5,2017-01-23T16:25:42.000Z,chibiuniverse7,Excellent diet Tracker,"Really enjoy this app as it has one of the best data bases and makes it's easy to search and the track food. Easy to use interface, my wish list would be an easier way to update your goals"

2850,2850,4,2011-03-05T15:57:12.000Z,Mysticd,Awesome App!,My mom and I both are using this app and we've both lost over 50 pounds combined.  This app will scan the barcode and will enter it into your daily journal.  That is awesome.  It also has popular restaurant nutrition guides and a weight tracker.  I absolutely recommend it.  There's nothing about this app that I don't like.
2851,2851,4,2014-09-26T12:31:15.000Z,Bebe sport,My favorite app!,I have been using fatsecret for over a year and can't live without it.

I love the display in the food entry portion showing protein, fat, carbs.  I don't use any of the social stuff right now just the food entry, weight tracker, and exercise pages!  Highly recommend this app"

2855,2855,4,2016-08-27T15:16:03.000Z,Drshivers2b,Mrs,"I have used this now for several years and it's great!  Can track exercise, dietary intake, etc and it gives you back quite a bit of data and trending ability.  The fatsecret community forums are wonderful and supportive; I've never seen anyone be dramatic or snippy.  I recommend this to my friends all the time."
2856,2856,5,2016-09-30T05:31:35.000Z,Drwhyly,Excellent,"Great and useful! I used it on ad aily basis, all day and every day! It needs update from time to time, especially supplements, for instance, Iso Lea Pro by Labrada not available in App, which you can add by yourself , and what I like most about this app. All in all, it works fine I use daily!!"
2857,2857,5,2017-01-24T18:41:51.000Z,DrKSP,‚ù§Ô∏è it!,"I have never been a calorie counter but after 2 kids and almost 40, I needed to start. This app is great. Has lots of options, brands, already listed but adding homemade recipes or new items is easy too. Really liking it!!"
2858,2858,3,2017-04-20T21:06:10.000Z,Gardeningfan,Unhappy with recent update,"Please remove photos of other users food that appear when the app is opened. I've used this app for years and love it however after the recent update, now photos of food posted by other users appear when the app is opened. As a struggling dieter, I have no desire to see pictures of other users food."
2859,2859,5,2017-06-27T03:31:02.000Z,Ashabooblie,Love for years,I've been using this app for a few years now and they have only gotten better. Love the option to scan UPC codes and occasionally use recipes that always come out great!
2860,2860,2,2012-01-25T16:01:44.000Z,3amigos@,Less then 24hrs in.,"It has just turned off, twice, in the middle of entering a meal, and didn't save any of it. This morning it will only let me put in 4 items for breakfast, and in exercise it recorded a different activity, and I couldn't change it back."
2861,2861,4,2012-02-13T21:34:16.000Z,Edistojan,Mrs,I absolutely love this app however it won't track my weight loss on my iphone 4s nor will it calculate calories used in exercise since it won't accept the weight I put in.  It also would be nice to be able to assemble a favorite recipe list.  Other than these issues a fantastic app.
2862,2862,4,2012-05-17T14:21:35.000Z,musiclova21,Suggestions?,"I love this app! It is easy to work with and I like how it is organized. I wish we could add a few things, for example: a spot for just water we drink during the day, a slot to make a list of medicine we take during the day, and a spot just for notes (how we felt that day, etc)"
2863,2863,4,2012-10-06T02:10:13.000Z,Kmett,Best food list around,"I have been using this app since July and it has so many foods already in it's database. With the exception of some crashes, I haven't had issues with it."
2864,2864,4,2014-05-19T08:04:55.000Z,xuyang.j,Bug with RDI function,"It doesn't seem to take target weight into consideration. Plus, the current weight changes right after it is saved. (an automatic increase of .7 pound)"
2865,2865,5,2015-11-10T22:49:47.000Z,hentaibih,Thank you so much!!!,"Currently this app is helping me track and of I eat and how much I eat, and helps me not to go above my calorie count. The results are magical and its exciting know the each time I open this app, I'm coming closer and closer to my goal. Definitely 5 stars."
2866,2866,4,2015-11-16T16:02:49.000Z,LisaKay1964,Works well,I've used this app for 4 years now and it has some functionality that I really like. The ability to reset calorie budget when weight changes is a plus. It seems like some types of exercise aren't in the app anymore like various speeds of walking but I improvise.
2867,2867,5,2016-05-03T19:13:37.000Z,Duncs S,Pretty straightforward and easy to use,I have enjoyed this application for tracking calories consumed daily and also for exercise. The database of food items is fairly extensive and rarely have to search elsewhere
2868,2868,5,2017-04-13T12:43:48.000Z,Averee Lou,Love it! Great app!,"Has lots of great features from a huge list of restaurants and restaurant items to the ability to track your weight and exercise routine. No bugs and doesn't crash, no annoying ads, best app on the market!"
2869,2869,5,2017-06-15T03:02:20.000Z,rshinds0123,Helped me track diet daily!,Easy to use and can't beat the price!  Helped me track my diet all the way down to nutrients.  The reports are great too.  Really kept me on track each and every day for the last 45 days.  Great app for those on strict diet.
2870,2870,5,2010-05-05T00:07:38.000Z,Gundlach Girl,Wish List,"I wish you could select multiple items from a restaurant at once, instead of having to Save each item and start over.  Am I missing something?  Otherwise, I love it!"
2871,2871,5,2015-09-25T19:39:45.000Z,Missmelipie,Love this app,"5 stars! The only thing I would like is to be able to pull different meals from different areas. Like take my breakfast and add all that to my dinner.. Sometimes you like breakfast for dinner. Or take one of my snacks and put that into lunch. Anyway, still love it!"
2872,2872,5,2015-09-26T01:39:15.000Z,Thejayman1048,It really works,I discovered the app on August 15 and weighed 255. It's now September 25th an this morning I weighed in at 226.6. The best part is I have had fun and have not been hungry at all. My goal is robe under 200 by if November and it this pace it seems that is going to happen!! What else do I need to say?
2873,2873,4,2016-01-05T20:48:39.000Z,MotorboatJones,"Great app, missing only 1 feature",I really love this app. It is so much better than other tracking apps. I only wish you could edit some meals.
2874,2874,5,2016-03-03T16:24:39.000Z,"Good game.,!",Love this app,Use it all the time to track specific foods and calories. Like the ability to scroll and change amounts eaten & times for types of workouts. Keeps me disciplined to the end goal and already seeing results.
2875,2875,5,2016-04-15T10:29:13.000Z,A.J. Cav,Love this app.,I have downloaded and tried quite a few apps. This one is perfect for me. It's clean design keeps things super simple to read and comprehend my macros.  I regained control from a weight loss stall and use it everyday now. Recommend it highly.
2876,2876,4,2016-06-21T08:26:45.000Z,djc0,Pretty good,"A recommendation: Can exercises be factored into the daily RDI? If I run and burn 600 calories, then really I have my RDI+600 calories to eat that day to maintain my weight/calorie goal. Otherwise RDI is a bit useless when you exercise a lot, unless you're happy to abandon the exact and work with averages. Or have to keep doing the math in your head."
2877,2877,4,2016-11-08T10:27:35.000Z,Mama Bear Dearest,Great!,"I tried using MyFitnessPal to track my macros because I recently started a ketogenic diet. For some reason, it wasn't letting search the database for food. It was way more confusing to use than I remember. So I discovered Fat Secret, and I love it! It's easier to use in my opinion, and I can customize everything."
2878,2878,5,2017-04-12T20:35:49.000Z,Jazzyfizzle1996,Perfect,"Calorie counting doesn't work for everyone, but it's helped me so much. This app is free and perfect for keeping track of calorie intake and burn, as well as macro and micronutrients. It's taken me time to get used to just a different lifestyle, but have lost 10 pounds and counting with this app."
2879,2879,5,2017-07-06T13:34:31.000Z,Will 1970,Makes it easy,Having so many foods in its database really makes it easy to enter calorie information. The barcode reader makes it so very simple when cooking at home. Almost addictive to use. Highly recommended.
2880,2880,5,2012-06-08T03:16:51.000Z,Peachymom28,Great app it should be the only one listed,This is the best app by far.  It does have a glitch where it closes for no reason.  Still it beats the other 8 I tried.  I even tried the nutrisystem app and a pay app.  This one is much better and free!
2881,2881,2,2012-08-15T11:03:46.000Z,Veldy,Same bugs still exist latest version,***I keep reporting and they keep leaving the bug.*** Using another app pal.
2882,2882,2,2013-12-11T11:48:56.000Z,HoosierMommy22,Meh...,I like the app for what it is but there's nothing to set it apart. I am looking for a paid app with more advanced features.
2883,2883,5,2015-03-09T06:57:42.000Z,phunkin,The best by far!,"This app is absolutely the best calorie counting app available. I have tried so many, but this one is the most comprehensive. It helped me reach my goal of losing 130 lbs in 11 months, now it's helping me to maintain a healthy weight. Thank you Fat Secret for helping save my life."
2884,2884,5,2015-03-28T00:14:17.000Z,Dlinds87,Great way to lost weight!,"I've been using this app for years.  It helped me get to my goal weight and keep it off.  The ease of scanning barcodes, tracking exercise, and the integration with HealthKit is great.  It's definitely a must have app for those who are health conscious."
2885,2885,5,2015-11-27T04:10:17.000Z,SamanthaGoodwin219,It's my favorite,I've went through many many apps trying to find help on counting carbs and this app is by far the best. It has every restaurant and food brand you can imagine... Makes type one diabetes a little more simpler.
2886,2886,5,2015-12-02T21:46:00.000Z,Afhog,Use it everyday,"I use fatsecret everyday to track my macros. It does a great job with a ton of foods in the database and if a food isn't in it I can add it myself. This food log has helped me lose 20 lbs of fat, keep it off, and change my lifestyle to eating more healthy!"
2887,2887,5,2016-12-01T02:28:57.000Z,clareg123,Saved all my info from 2009!,I fell off the food diary bandwagon about two years ago and went back to Fat Secret last week. And all my info and foods and exercise were still there! This has saved me a lot of time and typing. LOVE THIS APP
2888,2888,5,2016-12-05T12:37:10.000Z,RONWILL4,My go to app!!,"I've been using this app for years.  Originally started using it to track my daily carbohydrate intake.  It turned into my diet conscious, if I didn't want to log it, I didn't eat it... I still use it to stay on track."
2889,2889,5,2017-02-22T20:55:29.000Z,Dallas Richter,Easy to use!,Better than MFP (in my opinion) I'm actually able to calculate my macros freely. If I'm losing or gaining I can adjust the numbers on the fly without paying for a premium fee like my fitness pal. It's the small things that make a difference guys!
2890,2890,5,2010-01-09T19:40:12.000Z,PA Man,Very good app,"There was a date problem however the latest update I downloaded 01/08, have solved the problem."
2891,2891,5,2010-01-12T16:26:31.000Z,MyReview78,Love it!,I cook Puertorican food all the time and I love how you have calorie info for many of the dishes that I eat! I love how this app doesn't single out people who actually cook. (Other apps list only foods from restaurants or microwavable brands.) Great job guys!!! 10 stars hands down! =}
2892,2892,3,2011-11-07T19:33:31.000Z,SharonKN,I don't like this app.,"This sounds like a great app, but they are too controlling for my tastes.  Today I had chicken salad for lunch.  It's not in the database and I can't add it.  It seems that you have to submit foods to the group and have them approved.  This is not the kind of app I want.  So I'm deleting it.  Dictating what foods I can eat and can't eat and having to have someone's approval is ridiculous."
2893,2893,5,2012-05-20T21:54:10.000Z,gmljr,Fat secret calorie counter,"Love this app.  It's been a key tool in my successful weight loss of 22 lbs.  if you're starting a weight loss plan, congrats!  Hang in there and know it takes time.  Do little things every day and lose it the right way, you'll feel great!"
2894,2894,5,2015-09-17T13:02:41.000Z,Sookeesook,Best calorie tracker for free,I get a discount with weight watchers but this app is better and free. My main focus is keeping calories down. This pinpoints every detail of my day. Like the journal part to look back. Links to apple health app. Only thing is probably the name with the word fat.
2895,2895,5,2016-02-28T23:51:12.000Z,CShell7568,Great app,"I love this app.  Used it for a long time... Fell off the wagon with it a couple years ago but after finding all the weight I had once lost, began using it again."
2896,2896,5,2016-06-09T14:47:30.000Z,Lynn333333333,Super easy and effective,I love how I can choose which micro or macro nutrients I want to focus on while not being overwhelmed with a lot of information. I've enjoyed using this app for the last month. Not going to use anything else.
2897,2897,5,2016-08-30T22:49:47.000Z,Carissa C,Easy to use and keeps me honest!,"I've tried a ton of other calorie trackers and I love this one the best! With the others, I felt like I was cheating myself with my calories and ""burning"" them, but this one has been keeping me honest. I love the grid because it's a good visual!"
2898,2898,5,2016-11-01T17:14:09.000Z,Nenaaaaaa1,Awesome!!,This app blows my fitness pal. out of the water. I like how you can actually see the total macro count up at the top of each meal and don't have to go back and forth with the calculator. Deleted my fitness pal as soon as I started using this! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
2899,2899,5,2017-09-18T02:12:51.000Z,Zack Betz,Quality app,I switched to this app from MyFitnessPal.
2900,2900,4,2011-10-09T19:32:23.000Z,Mjcolorado,Love this app!,"This app has a better database then any other app. This app can be tailored to whatever kind of eating regimen you want. Only a few things would make this app 5 stars. Having a favorite foods, it does crash sometimes, and I'm unsure about a recipe builder.  Keep up the great work and thank you that it's FREE!"
2901,2901,4,2012-04-10T15:36:58.000Z,Meme x 3,Nice!!!,Love this app...would be a 5 star app if it had a recipe folder. Hate having to search over and over for the recipes I find and want to make later. Would also be great if you could track your water intake. Fix these issues and this app would be top notch!!! Thanks.
2902,2902,4,2013-10-25T18:37:35.000Z,Flip Flop Lady,Recipes,"How about having a category for vegetarians! Even when I look at your ""vegetable"" category, many of the recipes call for meat. Thanks. Other than that, great app, but I would rather have NO space taken up for recipes than have these non-vegetarian friendly ones ."
2903,2903,5,2016-01-06T17:21:52.000Z,Sissy Boom Boom,Convert from SBD app,A solid app (not repeatedly buggy). No constant requests to purchase a membership. The the fat/carb/prot percents and graph are very useful. The food database covers most of what I eat. Easy to add new foods. Have yet to work the recipe function. In sum: it works really well for managing effort to be healthier.
2904,2904,5,2016-02-02T13:19:16.000Z,Nah so so x,Great useful app,I love the way you can track your progress in all kinds of ways. You can check it on any of your devices and you can do and follow up on whatever diet or regimen you care to follow. Very practical and unobtrusive

2906,2906,5,2016-09-14T21:31:07.000Z,Rinapop,Love this app,"I really recommend this app to someone who wants to loose weight!!! This is very easy to use, has a lot of options asp if you like to control the portions, I found everything that I eat  a day, shows % of fat and carbs, love it!"
2907,2907,5,2017-01-30T11:58:37.000Z,Rebekah75,Great,"I really like the reports you can print from this app. The fact that you can also invite your dietitian, nutritionist or wellness coach to view your journal is very helpful when you are participating in a weight loss program."
2908,2908,5,2017-04-13T20:06:54.000Z,rlangson,Very easy,This app has made it very enjoyable to track my calories. It took one day to adjust to understanding how to enter everything then after that it has become rote. Thank you guys for making this app.
2909,2909,5,2017-04-25T15:41:12.000Z,Blueskies520,Works well for me!,"This app works well for me, it's easy to customize, add exercise and it has a ton of restaurants. Plus if you're eating your macros it adds up every meal for you and gives you a percentage break down."
2910,2910,3,2010-04-14T18:09:33.000Z,Jill457,Wish I Could Still Use It,"I used to love this app, until it started crashing all the time. Now you have to wait for the ads to load before you do anything, and they load so sloooooooow, I've finally given up. I don't use the app any more and am looking for a replacement. Too bad, because it has a lot of great features."
2911,2911,5,2010-05-16T15:57:48.000Z,Holte Ender,A well designed iPhone app,As an intermittent user of the website I can appreciate the thoughtful design of this app. It is much easier to use than the website making it childs play to track calories Nice job guys!!
2912,2912,2,2010-08-19T18:54:19.000Z,DJ Flava,Barcode Scanner Not Working,"The scanner has only worked once for me, which is extremely frustrating... The saving grace is that if I can't scan, I can punch in the barcode -- w/out that option, I'd delete this in a heartbeat. I like the look of many other similar apps much more, but the other apps with scanners all seem to cost money to use in the same way I can use this app."
2913,2913,4,2011-01-24T08:48:17.000Z,Kira7230,just one thing..,Love it! Only thing is i wish i was able to see the longer descriptions.. i.e. what it considers heavy or light calithenics... it cuts off the description and apparently doesn't share the iphones capability of going into landscape mode when u turn it... but otherwise pretty groovy.
2914,2914,4,2011-04-29T03:32:12.000Z,XDrewx89,Pretty good app,This app is very useful and can certainly help you achieve your weight goals ( no matter what they are).

2916,2916,3,2014-04-15T03:06:06.000Z,Fatman & Little Boy,Not easy to enter recipes,"I'm having problems entering recipes via my iPhone 4. When I try to adjust quantities the app tries to recalculate all the necessary info, which then crashes the app. Honestly, things would be a lot easier if we can enter values via keypad. Otherwise, the app is great in helping me track my caloric intake & how much energy I burn."
2917,2917,5,2015-04-16T17:06:51.000Z,Shanik128,Love this app but I want more,Hello I love this app I have been using it for 4 years however I really want a water tracker or water stars or a water tank build in the app! Overall love the app very easy to use and it's fun tracking everything it's really helpful!

Unfortunately, the latest update has caused the app to ""time out"" several times a day for hours at a time. Please fix. I've never had a problem with this app before."
2919,2919,5,2016-02-09T12:22:54.000Z,bhaird,Great help to focus on better eating habits,I struggle with controlling my eating. Always surprised to see how poorly I choose the food I eat. This app helps my realize exactly what I eat and makes it much easier to control. And lose weight

A pie chart allows the user to view the days nutritional values at a glance, i.e. carbohydrates, fat, fiber. It should also allow user to select which nutrients to view.

I wish it would have actual Excercise tapes though as energy burned. Like p90 x or 10 min trainer. That would be great and choosing intermediate, moderate or excelled"
2924,2924,5,2013-07-10T01:51:39.000Z,Lmkss,Love this!,I used to use this years ago on my blackberry and I just rediscovered it! Better than myfitnesspal and it does not minus the calories you burn on the graph so you still are aware of the calories you need to eat every day.
2925,2925,5,2015-05-18T16:20:16.000Z,Sp33dy69,Very impressive,I absolutely love this app! The only thing missing is the heartbeat sensor option that I have to use another app for. Highly recommend this app to anyone who wants to keep track of calories consumed/expended with ease!

Track my macros & it tells you how much eat food contains..If I could ask for anything it would be the choice to put your own macros in but then again this is good enough... ‚ù§Ô∏è love it!
2929,2929,5,2017-09-03T14:21:38.000Z,Quietudio,Great app,"I truly found a very helpful way to be more aware of what I eat, how I eat and what is full of carbs or calories - it's extensive library of foods makes it easy to pick from."

More often than not though, I get a message telling me the ""network has timed out, try again later."" Not handy! I think I'll keep trying a little bit longer because it really is a good app when it works, but I'm about to give up."
2931,2931,5,2015-06-25T22:06:43.000Z,Donny Baseball,Awesome weight loss & fitness tracking program,This app is the best tool to help you track your food intake and fitness calorie burning. I lost over 30 pounds by honestly inputting my info. I have input every meal for past 5 years. Thanks!

2933,2933,3,2015-10-13T00:04:58.000Z,SamEJH,Was perfect....,This app is intuitive and easy to use. It has 90% of the foods I eat need to track and was easy to see daily and per meal macronutrient breakdown.
2934,2934,5,2016-07-02T16:00:59.000Z,BeTheKim,Baby weight gone!,"Using this app for the second time after having another beautiful baby girl! After gaining 50 lbs both times, I am back in my pre-pregnancy clothes at 4 months postpartum again! Love this app!"
2935,2935,5,2017-01-18T15:43:17.000Z,B-rice147,Better than MFP,Seriously this app has a ton of features that make it worthwhile. Tracking your food (including scanning barcodes) is very easy. Keeping track of exercise is even easier. And it's free!
2936,2936,5,2017-02-11T05:43:18.000Z,therealestmc,Great app,This app has helped me lose 10 pounds over three weeks. It's good to be able to watch what I eat and know how much calories that I take in and out. I hope the developer keep adding more features.
2937,2937,5,2017-06-13T19:50:57.000Z,Frugalchristianliving,Great for OMAD users!,"I am doing intermittent fasting/OMAD, and was just curious as to how many calories I was eating at my one large meal. Pleasantly surprised at how many great features this has! I use it in tangent with the app ""fasting secret,"" and the two compliment each other nicely. Thank you!"
2938,2938,4,2017-08-18T02:38:52.000Z,Canino.luis,"Easy, and user friendly","Easy to track what goes in your mouth. Track exercises and progress or regression. The BMR calculator is a little higher than others, I adjust accordingly. They stay on top of updates and improve the app regularly. I love it. Give it a shot"
2939,2939,5,2017-08-19T02:22:02.000Z,Brandi0o,By far better than the rest,This site has been around far longer than i recall the others and I have been using it for years. I can do everything i need to - for free.
2940,2940,5,2010-05-11T15:03:31.000Z,GranNee Jo,Fabulous,"I love this application. It makes me totally accountable for what I'm eating. There aren't many items that aren't listed and adding one is a cinch. This is fabulous for those who are serious about exercising, counting calories and staying healthy and accountable."
2941,2941,5,2011-02-10T18:50:02.000Z,cld043,Love the App,"I love this app.  The scanner makes it so easy.  The sync feature is great.  Finally an easy way to log everything, making me accountable for what I eat.  I've lost 10 pounds the last month using this app."
2942,2942,5,2011-05-17T21:20:12.000Z,Smoofstuff,Love this app! It's the best diet tracking app around!,This is the only diet tracking app I have used consistently because it has the restaurant menus and the barcode scanner! It's also very user friendly to navigate through!
2943,2943,5,2014-11-21T12:31:19.000Z,Wow24/7,Great app,I am constantly counseling patients on sodium and sugar intake. This app is quick easy simple to use. It gives information on not only total sodium intake but sodium per serving and tracks it. Unlike others that only look at carbs sugars and protein.
2944,2944,5,2015-07-29T16:30:59.000Z,src_code,Love it!,This app has been the most reliable of all of the calorie counting apps and I've used it for years. I've lost over 100lbs and I honestly have to give some credit to fatsecret for helping me. Five stars and forever a loyal fan.
2945,2945,4,2016-02-19T14:41:13.000Z,Janabdu1797,Awesome app,I love the barcode scanner but for some reason a ton of things that I could scan before all of a sudden aren't showing up anymore. It kinda annoys me but it's fine seeing as I can easily find a similar product in the data base or enter it on my own.
2946,2946,5,2016-05-21T19:35:02.000Z,PowerWizard,Updated for IOS8 - Now it's Super!,This app has just been updated for I OS8. It is working beautiful! Thanks a lot to the developer for getting this back online so quickly. It enables me to determine the proper insulin dose for blood sugar control.  You are a lifesaver.  Congratulations!
2947,2947,4,2016-08-06T21:18:09.000Z,strdst1,FatSecret,Pretty well organized. Good educational tool to understand where calories are really coming from and since I was on  a low carb diet it helped me to fine tune what I was eating. Overall easy to use with enough information present to keep accuracy high.
2948,2948,5,2017-02-01T04:14:27.000Z,Girliern,Love this app!,"I have used this app for years! It is by far the best way to keep track of your macros and percentages. It has an extensive food database that makes it so easy to input your food, no matter what you are eating!"
2949,2949,5,2017-03-18T15:00:42.000Z,codydvick,Great,It's easy to use.  It makes tracking your calories and macros super simple.  You can also track your exercise and weight.  It's a really nice looking and easy to use app that I highly recommend.
2950,2950,3,2010-05-05T10:50:16.000Z,Lpowertrip,Now with export feature,Love the app! The new export option is awesome and works well. The app still crashes even after today's update. Today it was while using the barcode scanner. Hey I don't consider the crashing that big of a deal. Some OS's have been around a long time and still crash. Keep up the good work!
2951,2951,5,2011-06-02T13:05:59.000Z,rene itunes acct,Weight Loss Surgery,Wonderful app. Having had WLS tracking protein is very important. This app is perfect for my needs. The barcode scanner works well. I deleted another app because the scanner never would work correctly.
2952,2952,5,2013-01-09T13:01:00.000Z,dbajak,Love this ap,"I love this ap it helps keep me on track. Also love the recipes, easy to follow, taste great and are healthy, but wish there was a place to store my favorites. Sometimes find it hard to search for them again."
2953,2953,4,2014-08-30T20:04:05.000Z,Nrh435,Great app; one small issue,"I love this app.  Here lately though, whenever I hit the plus sign to add food to lunch, dinner, snack it always adds the food to my breakfast meal so I have to go back in and change it to the meal I want to record.  Using iPhone 4s.  Just curious if there's a fix for this."
2954,2954,4,2014-09-20T15:20:14.000Z,Anonnyfl,New iOS 8 update ruined the app!,"My phone did the new iOS 8 update yesterday, now my app will not work! Please fix this! I absolutely love this app but now that I can't delete anything after being entered it change amounts it is no use to me! I am now using another app!"
2955,2955,4,2015-03-17T14:00:35.000Z,Markmark1212,Great app,"This a great app, and easy to use. I like how it can sync with the health app, but I would like to see other features of the health app be able to sync with this app. Such as the step counter or distance walked or ran and have those stats be added to the exercise section."
2956,2956,5,2015-10-17T02:30:26.000Z,MarlysK,Very functional,"Easy to use.  Handy to have on my phone.  Sync's with my other devices.  Keeping track of calorie and carb intake, plus weight loss has helped me lose weight and keep it off."
2957,2957,5,2015-12-15T19:59:27.000Z,Aeslehc123,Im surprised this app was free!!,"Has a large database of foods, you can weigh in... This app keeps track of everything!!! The only thing I wish it did was a photo log (for progress tracking)... But thats ok, I have another app for that!"
2958,2958,5,2017-03-01T14:58:23.000Z,Bbheath,Works,Been using this app off and on for years. I used it to lose 80lbs the first time and now using it to stay in track. As long as you do the work this app will help you.
2959,2959,5,2017-09-15T07:37:38.000Z,j.frances-allen,Excellent weight loss app!,"This app is so helpful! It is easy to use and doesn't take a lot of time. I love that you can take a picture of a product, and FatSecret does the rest! I recommend this app to my friends!"
2960,2960,4,2011-02-23T20:48:55.000Z,Waymn,Great - but one nuisance bug,"Works great, lots of imbedded data, scanner works like a charm.  One bug ‚Äì  can‚Äôt create a ‚ÄúSaved Meal‚Äù  because the ‚ÄúSAVE‚Äù box is hidden behind the advertisement and can‚Äôt be move out to be selected.  Same problem with the RDI computation page  and Sync page and ??"
2961,2961,5,2012-03-08T05:35:02.000Z,Heather Pettus,This APP is awesome!!,I have used it for about 6 months now and I've lost 40 pounds and have finally hit my goal weight of 120!! It takes determination and really adding up every calorie but it seriously works try it!!!
2962,2962,5,2013-02-06T22:52:26.000Z,LoveMusic600,GREAT app!,"Love this app. Would be at goal weight by now if I'd have had it sooner. Love the new Recipe and Cookbook addition. Only complaint is it needs to add 1/3 and 2/3 measurements for items that have 3 servings, in which case the 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 choices don't work. Otherwise SUPER app."
2963,2963,5,2014-05-28T03:21:09.000Z,HerbyDuverne,Best ever,I don't review for any app good or bad but this is an exception. I have been using fat secret for at least three years. Best app ever for tracking your calories and food. I used it on and off. It helps keep track of my weight.
2964,2964,5,2015-08-20T12:33:50.000Z,ConcertOpera,Excellent tool,"Very easy to use and helpful app.  Once you invest a little time in saving some of your favorite meals, inputting is a breeze.  I wish there were more exercise options, but that's a small gripe for a very useful app.  11 lbs and counting!"
2965,2965,5,2015-11-24T17:30:41.000Z,Emily98790,Great app!,I prefer this to My Fitness Pal because it makes your calories look less intimidating through the way they format everything. Super easy to use. I have no complaints.
2966,2966,5,2015-12-30T14:48:26.000Z,Michellekarp,Simple to use,"Keeps track of daily food intake and exercise. includes information about common foods, even from restaurants. Tracks weight and goals. User friendly!"
2967,2967,3,2016-06-11T15:01:13.000Z,lfrancisj,Use it religiously but...,This app is amazing. The database of products and food choices right down to Chipotle is fantastic. I use it daily to track my macros but the most frustrating piece is that the app on the iPhone constantly has errors/and won't let me upload my numbers. This happens daily. Please fix.
2968,2968,5,2017-04-14T11:59:53.000Z,Steffi19676,So easy to use & a great tool!,"This app really helps when wanting to count calories, carbs and fat! It has really helped me watch what I eat and helps me with choices when I'm not sure if something is good for me or not!"
2969,2969,5,2017-06-25T22:19:08.000Z,Captain2846392,I've lost weight.,"It's as the title. I'm not obese or complex as other people that likely require a lot of effort, but this helped me track my calories easy. With limitation I've lost some weight. I'll keep going until satisfied."
2970,2970,1,2010-01-14T18:43:21.000Z,TLC-0630,Data connection required.,"The app requires an Internet or cellular data connection to work.  While it may be possible to always have connectivity, FatSecret makes no bones about mining your personal data in the initial Terms of Service dialog that you must accept before using the product."
2971,2971,5,2010-02-24T14:11:39.000Z,marianng,Recommended,Love using this app.   Being able to track weight watcher points is a definite plus and is what made me chose this app.  Would like more options in serving sizes but it is still the best out there.
2972,2972,5,2010-08-11T16:02:44.000Z,Dmenard36,Barcode Scanner,"Live this app, had it on my droid before getting the iPhone 4. My only complaint now is that the barcode scanner does not work and this is a great feature. Please Fix......"

2974,2974,5,2016-03-23T20:28:52.000Z,Happy feet 12345678910,Great way to keep track,Easy to use. It's easy to personalize the settings to fit your own needs. As good as some of the apps that you have to pay for. Great community and recipes as well.
2975,2975,5,2016-07-22T15:09:44.000Z,Dj_1973,"Easy to use, always in synch","FatSecret is a very straightforward, easy-to-use food tracker.  Pretty much anything you eat is listed.  It is easy to stay within the day's calorie range, and the at a glance setup makes it very handy."

2978,2978,5,2017-04-28T13:51:23.000Z,FLhawkWY,Best help yet !,Love love love this app. Makes tracking your daily meals a breeze ! ( also love the help it provides when eating out w the restaurant menu info : helps me make better choices when out and about )
2979,2979,5,2017-04-28T21:22:14.000Z,Ggilley,Great app.,Do the daily log shows you just how much habit eating and wrong foods you were eating. Seeing it total up every days makes you realize where you went wrong.
2980,2980,5,2010-04-05T02:22:17.000Z,Gardenpics,Great App!,Love this app! Love the barcode scanner. Was using another software on my laptop and I had to manually enter all the stats for every new food. This is so much easier! I'm already spoiled. Love the exercise and weight trackers too!
2981,2981,2,2012-08-02T22:50:07.000Z,Girltawk,An Awful Update,"The latest update is terrible!  When the quantity/amount of a food is changed, the nutritional information does not update immediately. This functionality worked well in the prior version. Also, the portion options are still too limited - especially the fractions scroll. Why do the programmers refuse to make this a stellar app?"
2982,2982,5,2014-05-27T16:29:25.000Z,Bunklet,Most useful app out there!,"I never have trouble finding values for the meals I eat; the database is amazing! You can easily track your weigh-ins, progress, calories burned etc.. Great recipes and meal suggestions for any diet you are on. Congrats on a great tool!"
2983,2983,3,2014-10-03T15:36:21.000Z,MerlinMartin,New update broke what didn't need to be fixed,"The new update pretty much broke the exercise tracking. Nothing seems to be improved in new version, but less data is presented on screen. I'm sure I'll get used to new formatting, but it's disappointing that the exercise tracking was broken."
2984,2984,4,2015-12-28T01:30:52.000Z,.jay,Love it. Just needs step counting for calorie adjustment,"This app is clean, simple, and works well. I hope the developer(s) add step counting data from the Health app and have it factor in to calorie intake."
2985,2985,5,2016-01-29T14:41:56.000Z,CF<3,Love!,I love this app! I've tried other diet tracking apps and I always compare it to FatSecret. The updates on the app are ALWAYS helpful and never pointless. I been using this app for years! I will never delete this app.
2986,2986,5,2016-03-01T15:40:39.000Z,Milkstool Driver,Great Calorie Counter,Excellent food search menu with every type of food you can imagine.
2987,2987,4,2016-12-14T15:41:26.000Z,Wildcat Workout,Nice app,"Easy to use and definitely helps you monitor caloric intake. I've tried all kinds of approaches for leaning out, and at the end of the day it's all about diet. This app makes it easy to track any food or drink which helps significantly with fitness and weight loss. Great app!"
2988,2988,5,2017-07-15T21:29:21.000Z,chefalmighty,Love it!,I found this a few years ago and it has really helped me keep my weight on track. It is very intuitive and lets you set up repeat meals for quick entry.
2989,2989,5,2017-08-17T21:04:25.000Z,Cool Ed,Great app,Great app easy to use and works fine for keeping track of your weight and diet every food that you can image is easy to be found I don't want to be a fat person Thanks
2990,2990,1,2010-03-12T07:14:50.000Z,Slartibartfast69,Crash!,"This was the most practical app on my phone until thevlatest update. Now all it does is crash and always at random times. I think it's the new ad banner, which I loathe. I would gladly pay any amount for a version without this distracting and in the way banner. Please offer a version without ads!  Fix the crashing and remove the ads and I'll give it the 5 stars it should receive."
2991,2991,5,2010-04-22T14:39:03.000Z,KizzleBizz,Fat Secret app is changing my life!,"I am changing my eating habits because of this app. I am now concious of what I eat because I understand what my calorie intake should be. The best 10 seconds I have ever spent was when I downloaded this FREE app! Thank you, Fat Secret!"
2992,2992,3,2013-03-01T17:08:21.000Z,EC6426,Used to work,I used this app a couple of years ago and it was great. The latest version though drives me crazy. I constantly get network time out error when I try to enter food. It can take 5 minutes of trying over and over just to get a food entered. Please fix!
2993,2993,4,2013-06-17T18:41:42.000Z,KRE02,Really like this app,This is my favorite calorie counting app by far. I do wish there was a multi-add function. I hate having to go through all the search steps to add multiple foods at the same restaurant. That's the only think I would change.
2994,2994,5,2015-09-08T21:18:33.000Z,Don'tSmashYourFace,Does the job,"This app actually works. No crashes, no complicated instructions. It just works. One caveat: some of the food entries are inaccurate regarding calories. Probably manually entered by other users."
2995,2995,4,2015-10-15T00:34:51.000Z,Poweryacker,Useful and intuitive,I use this everyday and love the custom meal app better than competitor apps.  I can create meals and save them and then easily modify them by item: i.e. Items included in a salad can be stored as a meal and then I can delet the items I chose not to include on any particular day.
2996,2996,5,2016-02-05T14:49:27.000Z,Lamesamike,Easy to use,Entering food is easy.  There is a good database of foods and a handy barcode scanner.  Knowing how many calories you consume makes food choices easier and you can see the results.
2997,2997,4,2016-05-01T04:16:12.000Z,Hazellnation,Love it but not as easy as if like,I love this app. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is I can not figure out how to change my calories a day or my start weight from a previous set up.
2998,2998,1,2016-11-09T10:29:24.000Z,bordyafromthestern,Painful to use,"I have used both my fitness pal & this.  This app is not user friendly, & when you find a food item that is not in the data base, or say you make actual meals from scratch, it is required that you first decode the matrix before you're allowed to put your own recipes in.   Myfitt is not perfect, but it is easier to use, the data base is huge, & putting up with the ads is worth it."
2999,2999,5,2017-03-12T11:23:13.000Z,Puz66,Love it!,"The app is very easy to use for tracking my food, exercise, and weight. I would recommend it to anyone trying to lose weight. I plan on using it to help maintain as well."

3001,3001,5,2015-11-16T13:28:26.000Z,Alphaheroine,Best,Ive used a few different apps similar to this but this one is always my go to. I come and go but this is the only weight aid app I do not delete off and have to add back. I think that says a lot lol
3002,3002,1,2016-06-21T06:20:11.000Z,Seesa405,Bummed and frustrated,"This was by far my favorite app, until this update. Erased all of my food and progress made. Not only is this a loss for me on tracking daily and weekly nutrition, but I was also using this app to track food as part of a nutrition class. I'm supposed to be turning in 2 months worth of food journals. Guess I will not be doing that. :( really hoping this is something that can be fixed."

3012,3012,3,2012-01-09T20:15:30.000Z,Jmcbks,Good app when it works,"Really like the app...when it works. About 40% of the time, I get a ""Timed out. The network was busy. Try again later."" message, which is extremely irritating, especially when the network is fine for everything else and has five bars."
3013,3013,5,2012-05-11T17:34:12.000Z,Cassiejosh,Love it,I've tried Weight Watchers and diet pills. Have seen temporary results at best. This app has changed the way I will diet FOR LIFE! The only opportunity is you can not enter in calories burned for a tailored activity. Otherwise it is amazing. I def recommend.

3015,3015,5,2015-06-10T01:00:36.000Z,TFarre,Great app,I've been using FatSecret for quite a while. The app is easy to use and the ability to access your account on the Web is also a great feature!

3018,3018,5,2017-06-01T15:17:30.000Z,Deanomites,Simple and helpful,"This app is free and if you utilize it well to negative calorie count like I did, helps a ton with weight loss. Wish it'd allow you to go back more than 2 weeks, but hey it's free, so no complaints."
3019,3019,5,2017-09-25T19:11:35.000Z,MeggyMondy,Great app,This app really surprises me as it helps me make smarter choices. Some foods I thought were high in calories aren't and others that I thought were smart choices ended up the opposite. Thanks for the knowledge

3022,3022,5,2014-04-01T03:52:28.000Z,gerrymax,The best!,Been going back and forth using this and other diet tracker app but I always go back to FatSecret because it's just the best! The predefined restaurant/fast food food selection is the biggest feature I like.

Best database,I've been using this app for over a year now and I can say with confidence that it is probably the best health app there is. The new layout for iOS 8 is beautiful and works seamlessly! Thanks FatSecret for helping me with my health goals!
3024,3024,4,2014-10-27T13:20:56.000Z,Pamcakes22,Good App,This app is good. They seemed to have worked out some of the kinks. My only change I would like is for them to allow me to choose all 5 of my columns and not automatically highlight 2 but tell me to choose 5. Really we can only choose 3.
3025,3025,5,2015-03-16T11:05:10.000Z,Bockey,Love this App,Found out I was diabetic three years ago and started using this app. Still use it to this day to track my Carb intake as well as my calories. Love the Quick Pick section.

3033,3033,5,2016-05-11T11:18:42.000Z,AJ_Syrinx,Excellent app to track your eating habits,I used the website years ago but love having the app. I'm losing weight by just watching what I eat and setting limits. The app is super easy to use.
3034,3034,5,2016-07-23T04:54:16.000Z,TuleeHunter,Excellent,310 to 220 and shredded with the help of this app. Not a flaw I've found yet. I'm a paramedic so the thorough and vast food info helps when I have to eat out. An absolute must have and the only review I've done on the App Store.

Also, when I go to look at a prior months stats, all the info is gone unless I go to a specific date then open the diet calendar. Likewise, in the diet calendar when I go to look at August, it thinks it's September. Please fix asap."

3055,3055,5,2017-01-16T14:16:00.000Z,jkey4tina,Awesome App! Very helpful,This is a great app and awesome tool to control diet. Most all foods pulls up with the search. I like setting up my normal meals as that is a lot easier than choosing each item every time.

3057,3057,4,2017-04-01T21:57:59.000Z,Chris Thinner,Pretty darn good app,I've been using it very successfully. Good app. I would do two things to improve it: 1) create a recently eaten category that includes all meals 2) make it easier to create and use a custom food. It's not an intuitive process
3058,3058,4,2017-06-06T19:50:49.000Z,squatch99,Better than the competition,"This app has a better food database than the other ""popular"" app that everyone seems to be pushing plus you get for free what the other one makes you pay for."

I'm planning to look for another app because sometimes it'll take more than 2 tries to save one food entry. If only it'll stop crashing on me; otherwise it would have been a great app.

After a few days I got the hang of it"
3070,3070,4,2012-02-08T14:21:14.000Z,Harley2510,Great if scanner worked,This app is awesome but the barcode scanner doesn't work most of the time. It just sits there and doesn't allow you to cancel or enter barcode most of the time. Fix this and I'll give it 5 stars!

3074,3074,5,2015-01-05T13:08:08.000Z,GranstraC,Great App.,"Easy to navigate, quick selections so that you can go in and out of it several times a day without taking a lot of time. Good for busy schedules. A lot of info at a glance."

3081,3081,1,2012-09-24T01:30:41.000Z,Boopmenow,Used to love,"This used to be my go to app for everything I ate but the recent changes just make this a miserable app to use now. Like most people I eat a lot of the same things routinely but they made the quick pic and recently eaten buttons virtually impossible to touch or use. And the scan barcode freezes quite often.  Guess its time to move on to a better, more comprehensive app."
3082,3082,2,2013-12-11T19:07:08.000Z,VRod007,WHAT HAPPENED?,I used this app almost 2 years ago & lost 15 lbs in 1 month. I gave up on it because too many redundant steps for same foods. Now I come back and adding foods via barcode takes way too long and almost unusable actually locked up app once and had to quit. I really liked this app before and now they messed it up.

3090,3090,2,2011-12-07T16:34:03.000Z,wmcrain2,Network Dependent,This is a great app IF you have good network connectivity.  I work somewhere that has no wifi and only limited phone connectivity (2 bars at best usually)  If I want to add a snack I have to walk outside to get better phone reception.  Would be a much better app if your info was kept on the phone and not in the cloud somewhere.

I've spent 45 minutes trying to set my goals and recalculate my calorie limit. I get everything entered, hit save, and the recalc stays at 1700 calories daily. Surely, this cannot be accurate. I use 70% fat, 25% protein and 5% carbs. After each save, it reverts to 5% fat, 70% carbs. Giving up and deleting the app. I'll stick with KetoDiet app."

3282,3282,4,2014-10-30T22:31:28.000Z,Mojavefrog,Mommy,I absolutely love this app! The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star rating is because the barcode scanner no longer works since I upgraded my iOS.
3283,3283,4,2015-07-23T12:39:03.000Z,Fatimoula,Very easy to use,I gain too much weight after retiring from dancing. This app has been of great help on this process of calories count and daily exercise! Very easy to use.

I have no idea as to how long it will take for the update and if will unfreeze what I already had entered."

3300,3300,4,2009-12-27T04:59:55.000Z,apple11,Good stuff,I give this a 4.5. Lots of food choices and it's easy to create a profile of your eating habits. This would be a 5 if it suggested ways to make your target weight.
3301,3301,5,2011-10-27T02:33:50.000Z,javdvd,Excellent app!!,"By far the best one and actually is multi platform, so if u have more than one phone there is NO excuse to no track ur calories"

3304,3304,4,2012-05-10T21:29:46.000Z,S o u t h p a w,Good but...,You should be able to make your own customized foods because certain things like peanuts or milk do not have the same calories as what the app says.
3305,3305,2,2012-08-07T02:13:48.000Z,icesicklepop,Bug,The last up date was horrible. When you would change the portion size the calories and everything would change for you but it does not do that anymore. Please fix.
3306,3306,3,2013-07-26T15:39:47.000Z,Kai Ming,Good but could use...,"A great app because of the recipes. Sets it apart from other calorie counting apps. However, it would be even better if you could star certain recipes as favorites for quicker search. Thanks"
3307,3307,1,2014-11-02T16:05:48.000Z,Retread69,Would be great but?,I liked this app right up to the point when I tried the scanner like I use for my fitness pal. That's when I gave it a thumbs down. No way to adjust the settings to access the camera to use scanner function for food items. Fix this and you may have something.

3320,3320,2,2010-01-30T18:07:26.000Z,DoyleOwl,Major Bug!,"When you try to enter anything in your exercise diary, it forces you to weigh in. Fair enough. You enteryour weight an save. Then you try to make an entry in the exercise diary and it forces you to weigh in again. And again. And again. This feature is totally unusable. Please fix."
3321,3321,1,2010-07-21T18:27:42.000Z,Cherylann95,Horrible!,Every time I try to use the barcode feature it crashes on me. It did work once but the screen to scan it was stuck on the screen after finding the product & then crashed again.

3326,3326,1,2017-04-20T21:08:08.000Z,Yorkin 3,Yuk!  Hate This App now,I use to use this for looking at nutritional information that I go to for restaurants and finding the carb content and that is now gone! I guess I will try and find a new app that does what this one used to do.  Never would have updated it had I known I'd lose all the restaurant information.  Useless to me now.
3327,3327,5,2017-07-21T15:14:33.000Z,Mombot212,Food diary works for me,I find adding foods to the diary very easy. I also like that you can search by restaurants.

3382,3382,4,2015-08-12T11:22:42.000Z,Youngclaire,New update new problem,I love this app it was only given 4 stars because it times out sometimes and then logs you out.
3383,3383,5,2015-12-08T17:51:38.000Z,CldBear84,Fat Secret,I love this app for tracking food. It puts what I eat in perspective. I can also upload it to my trainer which holds me accountable.
3384,3384,5,2015-12-21T10:36:32.000Z,Kclarkie7114,excellent its helps so much,I've lost 27 pounds in a month using this app eating right and exercising!!! I love this app and will continue to use it and succeed! üòÉ
3385,3385,1,2016-05-13T16:38:38.000Z,JesCab1,Won't let me continue Bc it says I need to consult a DR,Didn't even get to use the app Bc it's stupid and says I need to consult a doctor based on my height and weight. All I wanted to do was track my calories. Such a waste! I'm no where near obese. Not even as big as the average American woman. I guess this is made for the models that need to count their calories.
3386,3386,5,2016-10-30T14:01:13.000Z,Cheetah_three,The best,This is hands down the BEST and most user friendly dietary program I've ever used and it's completely free.
3387,3387,4,2017-01-19T13:51:55.000Z,Shawn102674,Good app,This is a good app. However it was better when u could put the exact amount u eat. Now you have to us quarter half and whole ounces to measure
3388,3388,1,2017-04-20T02:12:19.000Z,Steve...Steve,Doesn't work,I had high hopes for a good app but it never let me through the initial set up. Kept saying my goal weight was too low for my height and that I should seek a doctor. I changed height and weight and it kept giving the error. There was no way to bypass it. The height and goal weight I inputted was not remotely under weight (6' 200 lbs)
3389,3389,5,2017-05-12T13:04:40.000Z,X cookie,Fantastic!,This app has helped me watch my food intake.  Never realized how much I ate.  Great app for anyone who is trying to watch their weight.
3390,3390,2,2013-01-12T16:28:44.000Z,Serculios,Change is bad,Worked great until the entry screens changed one day and made it confusing to enter info. Enter detail went in a loop and enter path did not make sense. Great until then but all changed to a frustrating process in one day.
3391,3391,5,2013-03-04T12:55:23.000Z,RWilliamNY,It Helped Me,"This app for the past year helped me lose weight. If you are dedicated to it, it works by helping. I lost 40lbs"

This app was the one back then that had accurate nutrition facts for restaurants and food from grocery stores.  I deleted the rest and used this.   Over the years I have been testing out newer calorie counter apps that come out just to see what they offer but nothing compares to Fat Secret.  And fat secret may not be all physically appealing like some others, but it‚Äôs simple and easy and it just works."
4194,4194,5,2020-11-19T13:25:15.000Z,LizardLegz,Long time user first time reviewer üòä,I have been using FatSecret on and off for over 10 years. I originally used their website and transitioned with the app with various apple and android devices.
4195,4195,5,2020-11-09T16:13:49.000Z,teskandar,It Helps Me Accomplish What I Couldn‚Äôt Do On My Own,"I use this app in conjunction with the website to track calories and activity. It's useful and the large food database and ability to add foods to it are very much appreciated. It needs a way to sync data between the app and website and from one day to the next on the app without having to close the app and reopen it. That would make me change this to a 5 star review. UPDATE 11/9/2020: They have tweaked the app. It‚Äôs more user friendly and the layout is easier to work with. And it syncs now! Still the absolute best food database IMO. They have made it easy to update nutritional information. I used to have to use the website periodically to do certain things the app couldn‚Äôt do, but now I am able to use the app 99% of the time. It never crashes or acts weird. I‚Äôm able to easily track micronutrients as well as macros, which is invaluable in keeping my sodium intake, and therefore my blood pressure, in check. And it works! You must be diligent and weigh/measure when necessary and be honest! The app literally shows you what works and what doesn‚Äôt. I am 61 and quarantine wasn‚Äôt kind to me weight wise. With this app I have lost 14 pounds since June! Be diligent, be honest, and with this wonderful app, anyone can lose weight."

All of my info still here as if I had never gone off it.  I love how easy it is to use. Had it initially on Android, switched to Apple.  Easy to use on both platforms.  It‚Äôs actually fun using it as a food diary to record my meals, it is helpful to planning meals ahead of time because i can look at previous meals for nutritional info and see how they can fit into my meal plan. The users are all encouraging of others, a BIG plus.  Enjoy seeing what other peoples meals look like, get ideas and inspiration from them. The best part of this app is that you don‚Äôt feel like its an isolated, static app, you feel ENGAGED in a live, vibrant community where everyone‚Äôs goal is to be a healthier, better person and want the same for each and every person.  You can track your fitness/exercise as well as meals and monitoring of weight. It can calculate your individual recommended caloric intake based on your input values so you can adjust what you eat based on your goals of losing, gaining, maintaining. And its super easy to use."

Most didn‚Äôt offer any export/print capability, at all; one  required a subscription before that ability was enabled, but did at least have a 30 day trial period.

The only issue it seems to have is it relies heavily on the data connection all the time. So if you're off network it doesn't work well. It would get 5 stars if it had an ""off-line"" mode. I hope to see continued improvement of this great APP."

If they ever start using ads like MyFitnessPal and others, I will leave immediately. The programmers should be supported by getting a big community and keep up the good work. Thank you!"

I have tried other nutrition apps in the past, even the more expensive paid versions. I always keep coming back to using Fatsecret.

Pls solve this bug!!!"
4239,4239,5,2018-06-16T14:04:56.000Z,Goose0987,Great app,Fat Secret is easy to use (user friendly) It has all the foods listed.  And the camera reads the bar code for the box or can is great.  And if I forget to add a dinner meal it reminds me.  I love this app.

Instead of actually inputting every time. But that's nothing to gripe about! I love this app! Works like a dream!

4253,4253,2,2011-01-03T01:35:54.000Z,Laraway family,Update ruined app!!,"I loved this app until the update yesterday! First it wouldnt open at all, so I had to delete & reinstall it & lost weeks of food diary entries in the process. 2nd after I reinstalled it, it would close out after every entry I made (slightly annoying when you are trying to log for an entire meal or DAY!) 3rd and last straw: now the app will not even work AT ALL! says ""network has timed out"" & crashes everytime I try to do anything!! I loved this app. It was my fav calorie-counter out there. I used it everyday religiously as I am trying to gain weight. But now that it's crapped out I'm using My Fitness Pal or whatever and I was impressed & pleased to see that this app actually gives you the option between whether your goal is too lose OR GAIN weight! NONE of the other apps offer that...I always had to lie about my height & weight or it would tell me I'm underweight and should not be dieting & to consult a physician! LOL.  I'm happy with ""my fitness pal"" it functions properly & has everything that the FatSecret App did, also is free -so I recommend it to anyone who used this crashed app!"

4312,4312,5,2011-03-20T06:27:11.000Z,czernowitz,This App helped me lose 45lbs in 4 months,"Thanks for knocking some sense into me and for being able, by using this app to become more calorie conscious. The best app"
4313,4313,5,2011-03-22T06:28:37.000Z,fluffyinsomniac,The Best Ever,"I have probably tried every diet app out there, and this one has it all. You can choose your diet, set your preferences and sync between website and app. If you're doing Atkins or low carb, you can set it to count Net Carbs. It's very nearly perfect: if there were a way to monitor water intake, it would be perfect."
4314,4314,4,2011-03-23T00:31:42.000Z,Panicmama,Great app!,Awesome app with lots of info at your fingertips. Would give 5 stars if I could monitor multiple people.
4315,4315,5,2011-03-23T16:45:10.000Z,TulsaHart,First review ever,This app is great. Easy to monitor calories and exercise. The UPC scanner works well. Lots of products in the app. I have used it for 2 weeks and it always has my meals. My wife uses the WW app and she asks me for nutritional info. Good work!
4316,4316,5,2011-03-24T03:24:44.000Z,rosemdaniel,Best program out there!!,I love this app and can't live without it. It makes me accountable about my current diet and in turn I try harder to eat healthy
4317,4317,5,2011-03-26T09:52:51.000Z,Bnnhbbum,Does what it says!,I have been using this app on my blackberry now my new IPhone. I have lost 75 lbs thanks to this little gem of an app. It really helps you think about what your putting in your body and keep track of your weight. Well worth the price of Free99!
4318,4318,5,2011-03-26T15:07:42.000Z,Shelley_in_Arlington,Life changing!,"This app allows me to account for everything I eat and it has changed my attitude about eating.  At work where I don't have wifi, I leave my iPod Touch set on my daily menus so I can see my plan for the day.  The only complaint is that the food descriptions are truncated.  Wrapping the text or providing landscape mode would be a great enhancement.  I'm losing weight and I love this app."

Very intuitive, well designed, includes so many foods, and provides everything you need to keep track of your calories within a program. Yes, scanner didn't work, looking forward to an update for that. Overall great job!!"

I knew I needed to track everything I put in, but I never wanted to carry a notebook and do the research to find out exactly what I was putting in my body. This app does all the work for you, just tell it what you put in and your golden! To easy!"

I originally had the app when I had a Droid and had the same issues. Now that I have the iPhone I thought that I would give it a second chance. This app is TERRIBLE! I guess you get what you pay for!"
4327,4327,2,2011-03-08T22:05:29.000Z,My4loredos,Good app,I like the app but I can't stand the ads in this app. I have the iPad app as well and there are no ads in that one. Wish they would remove the ads in the app and I would give it a higher rating.

4330,4330,4,2011-01-31T02:36:03.000Z,Lucabela,I lost weight!,It's easy to use on the run.  I love that I can enter bar codes and it gleans the calorie info automatically.  I could not get the bar code scanner to work ever.  Does anyone have any hints ... Is it just me?  The good news is  I lost 6 pounds the first week.  Stay tuned.. I'll report back later.

4336,4336,5,2011-02-13T04:45:17.000Z,Gr8WhiteChocolate,Love this App!!,I use this every day. The barcode feature makes it a lot simpler than the version on my Blackberry. Lost 10 pounds in my first month and I wasn't even exercising regularly. I wish you could select multiple items from a restaurant without having to dtart at the beginning for every item. Still an awesome app!
4337,4337,4,2011-02-13T18:49:08.000Z,Turgmama,Love it!,Awesome app!! Very helpful and easy to use! Love the scanning feature! If I could make one change it would be that it would keep a running total of net carbs or at least the fiber count so it would be easier to figure instead of just straight carb count
4338,4338,4,2011-02-15T13:52:50.000Z,JFrenxh,Almost perfect.,Very good app. Very easy to enter food and exercise. The only problem I've encountered so far is that the ad at the bottom of the screen obscures the save button on some screens. You can touch the button and not the add about 1 in 5 times.
4339,4339,5,2011-02-18T07:19:25.000Z,Kona 808,LOVE IT!!!!!,I love this app! The scanning barcode is awesome and saves so much time making it way easier to track your calories

4343,4343,1,2011-01-23T15:16:17.000Z,"Carol Ummel Lindquist, Ph.D.",No fiber. No yoga,No record of fiber consumed. No estimate for yoga calories. Loseit works better for me. I was excited to try bar code.
4344,4344,2,2011-01-24T02:47:24.000Z,Karid5,No recipe functionality,"Barcode reader didn't work at all for me.  No recipe functionality either, which is a deal breaker since I make 99% of the meals I consume."
4345,4345,5,2011-01-24T11:59:02.000Z,Jmw401,Fatsecret app.  Love it!,"This is one great app. I have several others, but, by far, this has the most extensive database of any other app I have found. Have not tried the barcode scanner yet, but it should be a great help at the market. The only addition I would like to see is Weight Watcher Points Plus added to the nutritional info.  Thanks for a great app."
4346,4346,5,2011-01-25T02:04:28.000Z,Nina70,Awesome,This app makes it very easy to track your calories and fitness. The scanner works great. Love this app!  It DOES count fiber. All you have to do is change the display options by hitting the 3 dots in the upper right corner.
4347,4347,5,2011-01-26T20:10:46.000Z,AOEkici,Best app.,Many useful diet tools. Great app. Thanks.

4357,4357,4,2011-01-07T18:34:36.000Z,Ariel70113,It's working great again!,Thanks for fixing it!!! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish I could save the foods I eat often also I hate when it times out.
4358,4358,1,2011-01-07T19:01:16.000Z,ArchShepp,Great day,Worked great for one day. The second day a was calculating breakfast and it never worked again. Used on iPod touch 4
4359,4359,4,2011-01-07T19:12:08.000Z,Rosetta Demarest,I want to love this app,This app is great when it works. It keeps timing out on me therefore I can't add any of my foods without going to the website

I use this app every day and am very frustrated with this bug. ;(  However, I refuse to give it a low rating because it was pretty fantastic before, and I'm sure it will be again once the fix is approved."

4367,4367,1,2011-01-04T17:18:08.000Z,MikeyH2,Stopped working,This was a great app until the update! I find it hard to believe that the programmers don't test the software before they make it available to users! 1 star simply for the inconvenience!
4368,4368,1,2011-01-04T19:55:22.000Z,sfiore,Update Ruined This App,I loved this app until the update. I've since tried a couple other apps - they are OK but not nearly as comprehensive as this app was. Please fix it!

It works on my sisters epic so i dont see why it wont work on my ipod touch >.< pleaseee fix."
4371,4371,4,2011-01-01T19:02:49.000Z,Gainer2828,Solid App-couple suggested improvements,"Very good free app with great integration with web site. I've centralized all my weight gain activity here.  Other than the obvious stability fix (I feel bad for them due to the poor timing), suggest adding the ability to look up all previously entered food from a list (instead of top few for each meal) and a more granular workout tracker would enable me to track everything in one spot."

You could also track points as well as the current tracking categories. Well the points are gone, but I keep hoping they will come back in an update. Guess I'll have to wait longer since this update just brought continual crashing. Bricked the app. I'm sure the crashing will be resolved, let's hope the points will be too.....  (Still a great app and worth getting, however 3 stars for no ww points and the amount of scrolling required for various inputs.)"

4380,4380,3,2010-12-29T20:18:34.000Z,PLac619,It's ok,It could use a passlock. The adds get in the way when setting up your RDI and other settings. It would be nice if it was more of a goal oriented app then just a tracker.  The scanner and food choices work great. I like the weight check in and tracker feature.
4381,4381,1,2010-12-31T15:25:39.000Z,Begawkiness,Crashes,Great app before update but can't run now as with the latest update it crashes on launch every time (using a 3GS).

Track calories, weight loss, foods that you've eaten, and your progress. Also, you can chat with others for support! My favorite thing is the Bar Code reader though! You just snap a pic of that bar code and the app gives you all the info on it and logs it for you! I Love this App! I've had it for around 3 weeks now and already lost over 10 pounds!!!"

It would be perfect to have the option to include time of when I ate, especially the snacks/others. Also, include my humor at the time of eating, also especially the snacks part, because usually they are cravings and exaggeration."

Great for low carb, WW, etc. Bar code scanner is such a time saver and probably my favorite feature. Can add recipes, then get nutrition info. Can add single food items. Even has some restaurants. Endless ways to monitor."
4401,4401,2,2016-08-31T20:09:13.000Z,Hangingup,Camera Update...no good,"Since adding the option to take a picture, the barcode scan barely works.  If I use the camera option, then I am still having to search for the item if there is no exact match.  Might as well just search rather taking the extra steps to take a picture. It's annoying to enter the bar code numbers when it worked so well before.  Please fix the scanner, otherwise, I'm out."

Great experience in terms of ease of use, extensive food database, bar code or search option, tracks macros by list and graphs tracks goals in weight, nutrients, calories burned, etc etc, everything the other apps do plus this one has a daily notes feature and I can customize any feature  ....all for free. Love it!!!"
4410,4410,5,2015-08-06T11:34:25.000Z,Mcsilvey,Awesome,My friend has been doing weight watchers and I was looking for an app to help me. This has been perfect and it is free. I have been able to track everything very simply.  I love the bar code feature. It makes shopping and tracking so easy. I like the way it keeps track of recently eaten items or exercises. We are creatures of habit and usually do or eat something a couple days in a row. I usually load my usual items in first thing in the morning. If I pack my lunch I load that info as well. Then when I get home if I haven't eaten something I can subtract it. I have shared the app with at least a dozen people who really like it.

I found this app & plugged in my goal weight as per my insurance company's guidelines and with that I was told the number of calories I should be eating daily! I was surprised to see what a ""serving"" is compared to what I was actually eating! Using the app & some exercise...yes you have to exercise....I am now 188 as of today 1.10.16 no longer obese, insured at a normal rate, no longer in danger of diabetes or heart disease. I plug in what I eat which means I DO NOT DENY myself of any foods & I exercise. Please note it takes time....it took me 3 years to drop the 50 lbs but I've kept it off for 3 years!!! Good Luck!"

I know for a fact that I don't need 2300 calories in a day... I'm on a weight loss program. I just chart what I eat and my exercise. It's really that simple. If I can't find my item, or the bar code reader can't read my barcode, I can put put my item in. I Love it!"

Also, for almost each food one can enter a custom portion weight or size. Packaged foods can be easily entered by scanning the bar code. Negatives: it does not track potassium or vitamins. It does not allow to enter a custom food recipe."
4418,4418,5,2016-06-06T17:51:20.000Z,J & N 711,The Best App Ever!!!,I think I have tried most Apps on weight loss. Fat Secret in my  opinion is the best. Love the bar code.

4427,4427,5,2015-07-09T12:43:19.000Z,Cj$10,I love this app!,"I love that this app is user-friendly. The feature where you only have to scan a barcode and it and 99.9% of the time always has the nutritional information stored is wonderful.if an item isn't already in the database, it's extremely easy to add an item. I really like the feature where it tracks your daily or weekly progress. And it calculates your calories for your needs whether you want to lose weight quickly slowly maintain your way eight and then it tells you how many calories you can eat per day."
4428,4428,4,2015-07-11T13:27:38.000Z,Avidreader276570,Excellent and Easy to make a daily habit,"The food entry is really simple and the bar code reader really makes the phone app terrific.  The only piece of info I'd like is the net calories between food intake and exercise,which you get on the website."
4429,4429,5,2015-07-25T19:47:58.000Z,MJTwomey,Fantastic!,"Amazing functionality. It actually makes counting calories (and mgs if sodium) easy and fun. Without being able to look up nutrition info based on restaurant names, brands, or bar code (which the app makes easy), I'm sure I'd never bother. The weight tracker is also great. (I wish I could view the weight graph and a calorie graph simultaneously.)"
4430,4430,1,2012-07-27T16:43:04.000Z,MishiRN,HATE the iPhone version!,"Ok, I don't ever write reviews. In fact, this is my first. Let me start with a small disclaimer...I'm a tiiiiiny bit OCD, and probably more fanatical than most in journaling my daily exercise and caloric intake. With that said, I am so unbelievably disappointed with this app. I previously had a Droid, and I LOVED Calorie Counter...used it all day, everyday. At my biannual upgrade, I (against my better judgement) switched to the iPhone 4S, and the features and functionality of this app completely changed!"
4431,4431,4,2013-02-07T17:37:06.000Z,verdelaken,Like it,"I downloaded this app for my iphone because I needed to track my protein intake. However, it tracks that as well as fat, carbohydrates, and overall calories which I have come to find useful as well. I have not had a problem with the bar code scanner. I've successfully scanned several items from Trader Joe's. I like the feature that helps you calculate how many calories per day to set as a goal to achieve your desired weight."

The app is very handy, especially for bar coding information from new foods. Unfortunately the bar code function has a tendency to lock up. Usually when this happens it will clear itself within a matter of minutes. Recently, however, it locked up and blocked me from using any functions in the app. It would not clear out even after more than 12 hours. I finally had to delete the app and then re-install it."
4434,4434,3,2013-11-09T14:57:33.000Z,Sashilia,Bar code reader needs improvement.,Good app. Bar code reader is slow and shaky - need to use keyboard entry often.

4436,4436,3,2014-02-05T01:49:28.000Z,KiKi Daisy,Scanner,I love the app. It is easy to use and pretty quick to navigate. The search function is decent. My only complaint is the bar code scanner. It rarely scans anything. I end up punching in the bar code numbers.
4437,4437,3,2014-02-26T20:40:11.000Z,First poster,Use to be a lot better,"I use to use this app religiously back when it was called calorie counter and it helped me lose a lot of weight. I just redone loaded it, and I must say it has taken a turn for the worst. I love that you can find a more precise calorie count with the weight conversions available, but the GUI is less user friendly then it use to be. I also can't get the dam bar code scanner to scan anything any more."
4438,4438,4,2014-07-17T00:20:33.000Z,Question please help!,Great app but,Great app but i think there should be an option to add the macros manually if there is no bar code to scan. The % of macros would be nice too... But not necessary... Other than that its a great app... I use everyday and love it...
4439,4439,3,2014-08-17T15:38:33.000Z,Kamy7,"Good data base, but crappy bar code scanner","This app would be awesome if it had a better bar code scanner. I've used other calorie tracking apps that the scanner doesn't even have to focus the get the code. This one on the other hand is very finicky. You have to hold the scanner just perfectly to get it to work. Other than that, it's great. Very user friendly and has great restaurant information. If they fix the scanner, this app would be without equal"
4440,4440,4,2012-01-14T00:39:40.000Z,Kervie,pretty good but could be better,"Edit:  since the last update, the bar code scanner works great!  Thanks for the fix.  I am back to loving it!  End of Edit.  In general, a very good app.  I have lost 25 lbs using it.  I do have a few gripes:"
4441,4441,5,2012-01-18T12:07:38.000Z,Nunyrbusiness,So far it's an excellent app!,Edit: I am using this on my iPhone 4 and see that it crashes now and then  but that isn't interfering with my using it everyday.  I still love this app. End Edit.  It is visually appealing and will no doubt help me watch what I eat. And the bar code reader is awesome. I would definitely recommend. It has everything you need!  Thank you for such a fine app!
4442,4442,2,2012-02-09T23:05:06.000Z,vanhornl,A lot of freezing and resets and the bar code scan doesn't work,"I have been using this app off and on for awhile now and I think it has a lot of great features and is easy to use, when it doesn't reset, and the developers have made a lot of great improvements. However, they need to do a better job of quality testing before release.  The bar code scanner is not working correctly for the itouch and you can't enter a bar code manually without going to the scanner function first, which would be fine except the application will not respond until I go out of the application and re-enter.  Then, 85% of the time the app will reset.  That being said, I like the features they are including, especially when they get the bugs worked out.  I would like to ad my agreement with another user, it would be nice to be able to add a dish, set the serving size, and then be able to recall that dish specifying the serving size, or portion consumed at that time.  One last suggestion, many of the dishes will not allow you to designate a small enough fractional portion.  Example; if I have 1 and 1/3 cup serving, 1/3 is not available so I have to use 1/2 or 1/4, if a serving is 350 calories, that is a difference of 28 or so calories.  Decimal size portion of a 1 serving size works great, then you can enter a decimal fraction of one serving."
4443,4443,4,2012-02-19T20:43:11.000Z,Fat Radish,Pretty Good,"I have an iPhone 4S. I have not had any issues using the barcode scanner, so far. I usually hold it so that the red line covers the entire bar code, after a couple of seconds of holding it still, it will focus and accept the bar code. I was also able to enter a new item's info easily after the item's bar code was not found in the system. (New diet soda variation.)"
4444,4444,5,2012-03-08T03:42:11.000Z,pinkchampagne91,Great app for free,"This is a really nice app considering it is all free and I have yet to see an ad. It is easy to add food and exercise on the go and synchs with the website. I also like that it breaks down your food by what meal you ate it for, it helps me realize if i skip meals.It could be a bit more comprehensive in the review of the food you eat, but it is free so I'm not complaining."
4445,4445,4,2012-03-08T07:12:29.000Z,Teachertmb,Really great!,Bar code issue and ceasing issue MUCH better since recent update! Already lost 16.5 lbs using this app! The key is to save meals so you can add them easily. Also it helps me to plan what I'm gonna eat the day before so I don't impulse eat.
4446,4446,4,2012-04-30T17:58:00.000Z,Jenn2579,Please fix the scanner,I love this app except the barcode scanner freezes and you can't type in te bar code number.

4448,4448,1,2012-06-30T20:30:57.000Z,elizaj,Useless for cooks,"If you cook anything more complicated than a boiled egg, this is not the app for you. There is no way to create a recipe and then divide it into portions. You can create a meal, but each element of the meal gets listed in your diary, and the total can't be portioned. The bar code scanner isn't great, either. This app needs a lot more work."
4449,4449,4,2012-07-08T21:10:10.000Z,workoutnrockout,Updates Please!,"I like this app. As u can tell by my rating. The only constructive criticism I have as of now is that it would be nice I have an easier ""delete"" option for the food diary. I was thinking of integrating the apple way of sliding across an entry and having the ""delete"" button come up."
4450,4450,4,2010-09-07T20:53:16.000Z,Upsdreamer,Works good so far,This program has alot of features.

I would make it a 5 if there was a place to track water, enter your own food (if the bar code didn't recognize something, etc) and if the saved foods didn't save which meal it went to. But overall, amazing!!"
4455,4455,4,2011-06-11T17:13:10.000Z,Rondee19,Gray app with a few glitches,"Great app with a few issues. I used to be able to change my RDI to whatever I wanted and now it's pre-calculated. The bar code scanner is a great tool but 1/2 the time I go to use it, the app closes (a little frustrating). Otherwise I have had this app on both my I-phone and my droid and it has been a great tool for tracking my nutrition and excersize."
4456,4456,4,2011-06-14T02:06:44.000Z,xcrcr,Great app!,"It does occasionally crash, but loads fast. Bar code key pad is hard to load. Overall very useful and easy to use and understand. The restaurant/ fast food info is wonderful if you eat out a lot and want to be healthier."

My only two complaints is that for one it calculates everything under the sun but DOES NOT allow you the option to track points : (. I follow Weight Watchers so that small glitch is critical. Also the bar code scanner is VERY slow and generally cuts off / crashes before logging the UPC code . Other than that this app is fantastic! It has nearly every restaurant imaginable NOT just fast food chains PLUS it has every food you can think of on the market and even shows you a photo just incase you are fearful you may be logging the wrong foodÓê†ÓÄéÓÄé TWO THUMBS WAYYYY UP!!!
4458,4458,5,2011-09-06T13:12:51.000Z,LoloM9,Excellent! So easy!,"I usually abhor keeping track of my calories, but this App, and the online version (they stay synchronized!!!) ate fantastic. The database seems pretty huge and if a food is not in it, you can add your own by scanning the bar code (sooooo easy) or by entering the data manually. I love it."

4460,4460,3,2010-01-10T14:28:09.000Z,KEKE_NYC,Somthings missing...,Where is the option to take a pic of the bar code?  A friend has it on their verizon droid.
4461,4461,4,2010-02-18T01:08:45.000Z,Mwaddesa,,Great app!  Will get 5 stars once they add the bar code scanner
4462,4462,5,2010-03-05T00:45:23.000Z,Catonmylap133,thank-you!,the bar code scanner is great!  Makes the whole process of entering food into the diary quick and painless.
4463,4463,5,2010-04-16T18:46:13.000Z,smartconsumer77,One of the best,"I've been looking at all of the descriptions and features of similar apps (Free and with a cost), and this one has by far the most features.  It is also easy to use and you can even ""SCAN"" the bar code of an item to upload the nutrition information for that item.  It is a great app.  You need however to have a little patience when using it because occasionally you get a message stating ""network not available"" and you have to try your operation again.  Calories burned per activity seem pretty accurate according to your weight, height and daily activity level.  I would recommend this app...PLUS it is free, so you have nothing to loose :)"

4465,4465,4,2010-05-20T17:46:00.000Z,Bobblesberg,Got Lucky with WW update,"As everyone has said, in recent posts, this app is no longer a 5-star app since the update. I got lucky and updated via the iphone and noticed the weight watchers points were gone. so i deleted it from the phone and hooked up to itunes, where the older version was then put back on my iphone. now I will always have that red circled ""1"" next to my apps icon but it is more than worth it!"
4466,4466,4,2010-07-24T02:53:05.000Z,cnkeller,barcode scanner still not working on the iPhone4,"Verified that the latest update fixed the issues on a iPhone 3GS, but my iPhone4 (4.0.1 IOS) still doesn't work with bar code scanning. Tried all kinds of barcodes, at various angles, in various lighting conditions, with no success. Hoping it's just a quirk with the iPhone4 hardware."

4469,4469,4,2021-02-08T18:37:46.000Z,FabyFig,Not bad,It would be nice if you guys would add some vegetarian recipes
4470,4470,5,2014-10-03T16:58:02.000Z,Welkerfan,Only decent app for tracking macros,"None of the other calorie trackers make it as easy to track grams of fat, carbs, and protein as this one."
