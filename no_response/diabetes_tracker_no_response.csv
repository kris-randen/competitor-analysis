With this app and our age of technology, I'm never far from my phone.   I love that it interfaces with Fitbit and other apps.  Yes the food library is a bit limited but the app provides ways to help them help us.  It also allows you to put in your favorite recipe and account for things you'll never find in another place on the planet.   It conveniently lets you scan the upc and in most cases, the dietary data is provided.  When it doesn't, it's easy as pie to take a pic within the app of the front of pkg and of the nutritional data and they update the system as we collectively provide data.   You can keep track of anything you want in this app and it's especially helpful to see trends.   It's always a good thing to raise one's awareness and through the use of this app I've been able to significantly lower my A1C, lose 20 pounds over the last year and increase my awareness of what I'm doing to and for my body and health.  The spreadsheet is miraculous to review with your doctor and see trends that support your health.  My doctor commented, while I showed her the graph on her screen at the Ofc that she wished all her patients were willing to use technology to help themselves.  It inspires me to see the guy descend the slope each time I'm able to show another pound gone.   Yay for this app!"
1,1,5,2019-01-18T22:39:05.000Z,Nandav,Great app for Diabetes tracking,"This app is similar to MyNetDiary with added features such as tracking blood sugar and other medications.  It also syncs with other devices to track steps and exercise.  I also like the note-taking function.  I am using the Max version that I believe is worth the price.  Besides diabetes, I have other medical conditions and I find this helpful for everything.  Being able to log medications ensures that I don’t forget a dose or double-dose.  My doctor appreciated that I could show her my blood sugar results over a period of time."
2,2,5,2020-09-23T18:41:38.000Z,Rose Gardens,Good but reports need work,"Tracking is excellent. The paid version is great with xtra details for Diabetics.  However, the reports need the ability to customize. Printing is too small to read. I may be missing something, but you can’t change orientation, or get rid of the food grade column which is useless to my Doctor. The emailed report works, but the customized PDF daily can’t connect to the website and gives an error to Wait one minute and try again. They won’t process to print. This feature was working up to a few days ago. Emails to the support team have gone unanswered. Reports are the most important part of the app for me and my doctor. If this is not important to you, its a great app.  If support is given in this paid version, I will revisit my review."
3,3,5,2017-08-24T07:28:31.000Z,DaveSonoma,My indispensable tool,"MyNetDiary was my essential logging and guidance tool when I had to lose weight and get my diet into balance. Logging is a pain, even with a great tool, but for me it was the key to honest portions and steady progress. I could see my results in a wide variety of charts. In the long weight loss slog, an improving chart result was an encouraging boost."
4,4,5,2018-12-05T00:30:57.000Z,A searcher,I've Been Waiting Years For This App!!!,"Have been using 3 apps for years to track nutrition, diabetes & meds. Yippee!  One app to do it all. App takes into account all aspects of DM management. Was very impressed with d-carb count which make a significant difference in managing diet & meds. Daily summery of blood sugars, insulin & other meds, nutrients, H2o, activity, ability to set parameters for nutrients & blood sugars specific to the needs of the individual is much appreciated. Food database still on the small side but will enlarge as people use it I'm sure. I stumbled on this app by accident & consider it a very happy accident. Can't wait to show it to my DM & dietary educators. As a retired RN & having worked with many diabetics as well as now being diabetic myself  I can really appreciate this app. Good job guys!!!"
5,5,5,2018-12-11T11:36:22.000Z,tryin to do it right,Excellent!!!,"I’m a diabetic and track my blood sugars. I have tried several programs and had to input notes. With MyNetDiary it tracks blood sugars for you.  Charts for a quick reference of where you have been and how your doing. I especially like how you can check the rating of food, the breakdown of nutrients, fat content etc. It will show you the overall nutrients for the day. What your overages are ie fat, cholesterol, sodium and also where you have come up short ie potassium, vitamins etc. it will give you guidelines and information how to lower calories to help you attain your goal if losing or maintaining weight. I lost 50 pounds the last year, with a personal trainer, a nutritionist and MyNetDiary. My A1C went from 6.7 to 6.1. I came off of several medications that I have been on for years. Yes I still struggle with eating correctly but with MyNetDiary it keeps me accountable to myself."
6,6,5,2019-06-21T07:04:03.000Z,S.Lue,Life saver in many ways.,"Have a chronic illness is stressful enough.. living your entire life being a professional patient is HARD... but I’m extremely thankful for this app! Last year we finally found I have reactive hypoglycemia. It’s been a lot of trial and error, but being able to track and journal (and correlate blood sugars!) has not only been extremely helpful for myself, but also my doctors."
7,7,4,2019-03-12T18:05:14.000Z,owndao,What was free is now subscription,"It is infuriating to see features that were free become subscription only. $9 a month???? Ill write my own tracker on a spreadsheet. Then I can track and graph “tracked” items like I’ve asked for for years. Very disappointing to see simple tracking of nutrients now costing money. This is a trend in many money hungry vendors today, charge a fee for obtaining the app and then demand absurd amounts of money for features that were free and cost the developer nothing. I can understand needing fees to pay for subscription services in order to provide certain features that cost the developer to supply but charging for previously free services that cost the developer nothing because they are services that once included for one item cost nothing for 100 of the same."
8,8,5,2021-02-11T18:57:02.000Z,"""@&&$)((;//-realylovethisgame",Love this app! Worth every penny!!,"This app tracks everything! You don’t need any other app! One stop health app!!!!! I am a type 2 diabetic and I follow ketogenic diet. The app tracks my medications, My supplements, my blood sugar, my blood pressure, my oxygen, my steps,  my water intake,As well as giving me an amazing macros pie chart to look at. It lets me set my daily goals by carbs rather than calorie while letting me still watch my calories. I just love this thing! You have continued to make it better and better as I’ve used it and I am so excited to tell everybody to sign up here! I have told my whole family that they should have this app. So helpful for when you have medication and a forgetful mind to be able to track your medication & know exactly what time you took it! Wow,  you guys just keep getting better and better!!!"
9,9,5,2018-08-27T16:20:13.000Z,parkermv,Great app!,"***update from original post below. It’s been well over a year and this is still, by far, the best app for a Type 1 diabetic like myself. The only thing I could  hope they’d add is a Bolus advisor for folks like myself for whom a pump just isn’t an option.  ***"
10,10,5,2017-07-18T17:11:22.000Z,Limabuwa,Very Helpful,"I have used this app for a few months now and I really like it. I don't have diabetes but I have many relatives who do, so I check my blood sugar regularly just to keep an eye on things. I was trying to keep track of everything in a spreadsheet but this app makes it so much simpler. It's very easy to use. Entering glucose numbers and food is super simple. I like being able to create recipes for things I eat regularly. I've never paid more than a couple of dollars for an app before, but I would say this app was definitely worth the money. I also like that it links to the Fitbit app."
11,11,4,2017-07-18T17:28:46.000Z,mike-soba,All my stats in one place,"I had written a critical review previously (which I don't see).  However, after a few emails back and forth with the developer and using the app, I have a more positive response."
12,12,5,2017-07-20T13:57:19.000Z,johndig,Great system,This does everything they say and more. I use the diabetes add in and it tracks the most important things I need to know. Support is 5 star if there's a problem or question they will get back to you in record time. Getting and printing reports takes a little getting use to but it's nothing anyone cannot learn. Keep to the and you will lose.
13,13,5,2017-09-23T04:59:22.000Z,Vikwest,Great Tracking App,"Being diabetic, I keep track of my glucose readings daily. This app does that for me and makes it easy to see how I'm doing in the chart area. I enter all food and medicine, vitamins daily, and track all exercise. There is a chart for all so you can see your progress. It also shows a fat, carb, and protein sliding bar showing how much of each your body gets, and then the overage. It's great to watch my carb count. At the end of the week, you can print a complete report of all the food you eat and exercise. It's easy to enter everything you want to track. I really love this app."
14,14,3,2018-04-24T02:58:14.000Z,BillLenz,Long time user - do not like new interface,"New interface is clunky, too complex.  Too easy to enter data and accidentally delete it.  Reminders and buggy.  Keeps adding 24 hours to target times causing reminders not to trigger.  I am using my iPhone alarm to set reminders to test BGL after meals.  Labels used to sort current to to the top and usual near it.  Now there are a lot more labels but not sorted usefully so find what you want is a pain."
15,15,5,2018-05-17T17:20:44.000Z,blessingsbracegirtle,"Best app for Type 1, great support","I started using this over two years ago when I was diagnosed and it is what I use most on my phone from the time I get up and check my fasting BG and take my basal dose, through logging food, activity and ten or more BG readings a day to when I last check my BG before bed."
16,16,4,2018-06-15T12:22:30.000Z,JTinSC,App has glitches,"I use My Net Diary to track my blood sugar and insulin. But since the latest updates, the program has several major glitches. The most critical problem is that important nutrition data is not being calculated in the meal totals. The data is shown in the full description of the food, but the numbers are not loading to the meal screen. The problem is erratic and doesn’t happen with all foods. But as a result, my insulin doses have been off."
17,17,5,2018-09-10T14:33:19.000Z,HawaiianBunny,Think and thin,I have been using this app for about 2+ years and love it.  I can track all my diabetic insulin and carbs meds and exercise. I can go back days and months to see what works and what failed. I used this app for my Keto diet and lost 25# and tracked everything I ate plus added new recipes or foods. I could track my HCG and my insulin and meds. At one point I would print out my daily calories and take them to my dietitian to prove what I was eating and how to manage my insulin. I only had to pay extra for the print out but I paid only for the month I used it.  I can’t say enough good things about this app it has been with me for thick and thin. Lol you
18,18,5,2021-01-18T15:09:56.000Z,Toni by design,I love this app,This app is the best. I tried the others; however this one is easy to do. I've been doing it for six days and haven't missed logging what I eat and my glucose readings. It is helping me understand my personal relationship between certain foods and my glucose numbers.   I say cool beans!!!
19,19,5,2020-06-29T00:35:01.000Z,LizBre,The best app for managing the keto lifestyle!,"I tried 5 other top rated apps, this is by far the best one. With this app I can track my blood glucose, carbs, net carbs, protein, fat and a ton of vitamins and minerals; not to mention height, weight, body mass index, personal macro targets, water exercise, steps, meals, recipes, and custom and database listed foods. I especially like how you can use the bar scan feature to scan foods in the supermarket or at home to add to favorites and recipes. This app works great on my phone and my iPad. I rarely ever purchase annual fee based apps, but this one is Easy to use and well worth the annual fee."
20,20,5,2018-06-03T22:33:05.000Z,Frinklez,OMG! ❤️ it!,"I literally just got out of hospital because I was feeling HORRIBLE for a long time.  Unmanaged Diabetes.  It can KILL you.  It was killing me.  I already have health problems, but my blood had become too acidic, etc.  Dont be a fool, you have to manage your blood sugar levels track your foods etc.  I was following a high protein, low carb diet, but wasn’t consistent and I literally was destroying my body.  DIABETICS DONT EAT LOW FAT and HIGH PROTEIN!  Check out how to eat...it’s not what you think and this app keeps you on track!  They thought of everything!"
21,21,4,2018-07-18T22:51:35.000Z,"Timmy,,,,,",Great App,Love it! I love the store scanner app. It really helps you  make healthier choices. I thought I was making healthy choices this whole time. Not! Also like that you can scan your food in. The only problem is syncing my fit pro to this app. Not wanting to pay extra fee for this. It should just sync. Thanks to whoever made this app it is the best one I found that is so easy to use and cost efficient. Thanks for making my life easier. All the apps I visited are really ridiculous on how much they want to charge and they don’t work properly.
22,22,5,2018-09-05T11:37:13.000Z,gettysburger,Love this app for everything,"I have had this app for a while but never committed to it. Read an article about amputations from Invokana and decided to get serious. In eight days I am down four pounds and my morning number today was 102, the lowest in two years. My favorite thing about it is the food checker. I can go to the store and scan different products to compare their grade. Brilliant. I still get to eat yummy things but I can choose the healthiest from the bunch. Love love love this."
23,23,5,2018-12-03T02:53:14.000Z,RVC-FR,It's a great app!,"I've used this app for many years now and it has improved a lot. The truth is that the app is comprehensive and the sharing with Health App is nice. It also is able to import some data from the Health App like bp, and place that data on a chart. I like a lot the charts it shows where you can see your progress (or lack thereof). The widget allows for quick logging of blood glucose and a daily average. Highly recommended if you want to log and keep tabs on your progress. I wished it had the option to  track ketones in the urine."
24,24,5,2019-05-19T01:26:09.000Z,Black mountain gal,I love this app,I have diabetes an this is my go to support and weight loss tool. Sometimes I wonder away but always come back to it.
25,25,5,2020-03-22T21:03:23.000Z,manjer,Good diabetic app,"I really liked this app before, but the latest updates have made it even nicer to work with. I find I can't eat nearly as many carbs as it allows and still keep my blood sugar where it should be, but this can be adjusted in the settings. I wanted to combine this app data with fitbit and had to also purchase the max application; that didn't seem right to me, but maybe it was my misunderstanding. The app does allow you to track everything you need to and the reports can be tailored to most any of my needs."
26,26,5,2020-05-09T14:33:15.000Z,nickname: indy,Excellent,My Net Diary has helped me in tracking everything I eat and exercise to loose 20 pounds so far & helped me get my blood sugars down from over 200 into the 120 range. It has also helped me increased my water intake to a gallon a day. It’s been a big help. It’s important that you enter everything throughout the day so you can see that you are on track for were you want to be. My apple watch works w/ My Net Diary to track my steps & exercise. I paid for the full version. For me its worth it to accomplish my goal to a more healthier me.
27,27,5,2021-07-27T12:21:28.000Z,Great Grandma 3 Times,My Diabetic Tracker w/ Blood Glucose Tracker is Awesome,"I was diagnosed with Diabetes Feb 27, 2014. I  was 66 years old & there is no way I could even begin to properly keep track of my disease without this program. It tracks my glucose, my food, my exercise, my measurements, everything important to a Diabetic person. I'm always inputting information into my phone but I can't imagine how more difficult & more dangerous Diabetes would be to my life if I didn't have it.   The articles, tips & support help are awesome too. I totally recommend this program."
28,28,5,2021-02-23T17:42:37.000Z,Spartacus (Get Some),REALLY awesome.,"This wonderful app took the fear out of not knowing how to balance my diet by having complications with counting calories etc. Very well put together app, what a lifesaver. I hope this app always stay up-to-date and supported, it really makes a great difference for those of us that are looking to better our health due to health issues or not."
29,29,5,2020-07-28T21:57:38.000Z,PLW_CNF,Excellent for Diabetics!,"I absolutely love this app!!!  It is easy to log food and get full nutritional information.  This app is easy to read and has more integration of information, so if you need any information for doctors; you can create detailed reports."
30,30,5,2017-10-01T07:44:18.000Z,Tygerlilee,Like it,"I switched from another blood glucose tracking app and I like this one much better.  It's really easy to use and I like how intuitive the food logging is.  I wish it worked with my YUNMAI scale.  I don't want to have to buy another one to have it give body fat percentage, bone density, hydration etc that this scale already does for me.  Am planning on getting an iPhone watch hope to upgrade to max membership and that the watch works with it."
31,31,5,2018-10-29T16:44:26.000Z,ABirdVergara,I love this app,"When I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes I panicked! There was so many things I had no clue what they meant. This app helped me not only keep track of food intake, portion control and blood glucose readings but to understand what was better for my body. I love it! I recommend it to everyone! Even people who don’t have diabetes. It’s really helpful to go grocery shopping and scan the barcodes to understand what’s really inside foods!"
32,32,4,2018-11-11T19:54:34.000Z,TAI-JT,So far so good,Just started using the app to keep track of my blood sugar (pre diabetic) it's really helped me pay more attention to what I'm eating. Sometimes I may think it's something that's good for me to eat but it turns out it's not as good as I thought.  My blood sugar was all over the place but it's now staying fairly steady.
33,33,4,2018-12-04T23:29:06.000Z,biking1,Good but doesn't have a great food list.,"This is a good app especially for diabetics. Love the interface with Apple health and fitness apps. My only complaint is lack of library of fresh non processed or non branded food. Other apps are better in terms of having a larger selection of food items. However, I prefer this app for its interface with apps that bring food and exercise data in one place. Charts and dashboard are unreadable due things being printed over other reports."
34,34,5,2018-12-22T15:00:41.000Z,balldeagle,Great program,"I greatly depend on this program for records of my diabetic progress. This program is well thought out, and is very versatile, without a lot of unnecessary hocus-pocus. The developers continue to refine and improve this program. They are responsive to suggestion is to enhance the effectiveness of daily use. I would unconditionally recommend this program to any one who is serious about documenting their diabetic information."
35,35,5,2019-01-15T04:22:50.000Z,LutheranDad,Great for Diabetes,"T2D now on insulin.  The Diabetes app is great because it tracks multiple BGs, as well as insulin, a1c, etc.  It makes setting up recipes easy.  Note that the home recipes in my fitness pal aren’t available in the database this uses, because you can’t depend on the carbs being correct.  For a T1D and some T2Ds, that’s life threatening, so you have to set up each recipe yourself.  For example, 1 cup steel cut oats, 4 cups water, then weigh so you can calculate the carbs based on weight..."
36,36,5,2019-03-22T04:02:04.000Z,123itisMe,Saving a life one bite at a time.,"Finally an app that is so useful and easy to use and is literally saving my life. This app along with new technology like the freestyle libre sensor has helped get my A-1 C from a 17.5 down to 6.9. I may even be able to save my feet. I do not know of very many apps where the users can actually claim the app is improving their health and possibly extending their life. If you were diabetic, this app is a must have."
37,37,5,2019-05-16T18:15:58.000Z,Prairie poet,it does the job,I particularly like the versatility of that it offers me when making out recipes for dishes that I already like none of the other apps that I've looked at gave me the flexibility that this one does.
38,38,4,2021-07-30T13:39:38.000Z,Jmhfla,Great for foods not so for medications,"To begin, this is an excellent app for managing food intake. I am using this app to lower A1C and loose weight. It’s important to record everything, but so far it’s worth the effort recording food, exercise, and water intake as I am reaching my goals. By the way the app sets a realistic goal to reach the weight loss you want to achieve.... very good. I only wish when recording meditations you could repeat previous entries. Thanks for a well thought out app. Won’t let you print a report?"
39,39,5,2021-04-14T10:31:39.000Z,dds113,"Top notch, best easiest food diary","It’s not a struggle to log your food! It’s extremely interactive. Easy to scan your food and make changes, watch the apple and bicycle, watch videos and get helpful tips. They also send to your email a weekly update and breakdown of nutrients exercise weight loss blood glucose ( BG)  water intake. They have reminders to drink water or take BG if you would like and so much more. Worth the premium price 10 x over."
40,40,5,2017-06-18T14:23:13.000Z,sarahsanantonio,Very complete app,"I use the food log, as well as the exercise log and the medication log.  The food log has a very large database.  You will find most foods in there, especially if you eat a lot of processed and packaged foods.  It is a bit more difficult if you cook for yourself.  The medication log has been helpful to see if I've forgotten to take meds.  I don't have diabetes, but the diabetes tracker looks useful."
41,41,5,2017-07-25T14:55:23.000Z,Suzie1943,Useful for tracking almost everything.,"MyNetDiary has been very useful for all food related issues, weight, exercise. Fairly easy to use.  Only problem I ever have is for recipes which are healthier or made healthier with ingredient switches. Have to go to separate app to figure out nutritional values. But all in all, this app has worked well for me. Couple years later, it still works."
42,42,5,2017-07-26T13:40:45.000Z,GoKat4ever,Great application for weight loss and diabetes,"As a person with diabetes, I have tried a lot of different applications to help me manage my diabetes. None come close to My Netdiary.   My A1C is steadily going down."
43,43,5,2017-08-01T13:57:27.000Z,Wisconsin Lisa,Great aid for diabetics and anyone else,"MyNetDiary is a thorough, intuitive app that could be helpful for anyone that is attempting to get a handle on what they are eating, and when. Or anyone who wants to track various things such as medications, or water intake, or certain exercises. But it's especially helpful for any diabetic that is determined to get BG under control, helping you to see patterns and weak spots. Good luck out there!"
44,44,5,2017-09-12T13:29:28.000Z,SchilperoortJ,Super for diabetics,"I am a Health and fitness teacher and am always looking for examples of apps to show my students.  This was one of the best, working with the apple health app the students often take the apps I show them home to their parents.  The student becomes the teacher, the family learns and the student achieves higher order thinking.  It's a win, win!"
45,45,2,2017-11-28T17:37:06.000Z,Darlasu70,Nice app limited food info,"I love these features:  iOS friendly, tracking my blood glucose, exercise, food, vitamins and medications."
46,46,5,2018-12-12T02:34:07.000Z,santarosa707,Review after 8 days of use,"Great app for tracking diabetic lifestyle change. Like how it’s shows the relationship between exercise and diet. Like the various educational links. Like the ability to plan daily menus around what I like to eat and still have control on sodium intake. It took me a couple of days to get use to the app. Above all, It makes me conscious of the food I eat."
47,47,5,2019-01-09T23:32:02.000Z,Roundsout,Excellent App,"I am a diabetic and I use the app to watch how I eat, track my blood sugar, and lose/maintain weight.  The app has been very helpful.  The charts are very helpful and valuable to my physicians.  I’ve been using the app for almost two years now and with their improvements, I will likely be using it for the next two years or more."
48,48,4,2019-01-21T11:28:48.000Z,Fart shark,Sugarman,"I have used this app for about 6 years now. I recently upgraded my phone to an iPhone 8. I still like this app except for one thing, the blood glucose chart seems to be a little too big for the screen. It seems to be “cut off” on the right side making it hard to see the latest entry. My little old iPhone 3GS did not have that problem, I could see the whole chart."
49,49,5,2019-04-09T05:30:51.000Z,BeijingLoser,A necessity for me,"I've lost about 50 pounds with the help of this app and its linked exercise app (now incorporated into main app). I'm not sure how I would have done it without them. I wish there were a greater variety of Asian and Latin American foods on the list, but I love being able to customize foods, and overall it has been extremely helpful."
50,50,5,2017-08-03T14:34:21.000Z,PeggyHi,Life Saver,"I love this app.  My blood sugars were out of control .  I began using this app by recording my MEDS, everything I put into my mouth including the times, and found I was way over my daily carb intake which caused my sugars to be high.  The app is one of a kind.  It will keep track of everything to keep you in control."
51,51,5,2017-08-11T11:42:06.000Z,Rb32819,I enjoy using this app--really. It is easy and fun,I've been using this for 5 years now keeping track of my meals and numbers. Easy for my Diabetes instructor/nurse to check over and see how I've been doing. Easier than writing everything down.
52,52,4,2018-06-21T15:25:34.000Z,andy thurman,More information sharing please.,It is great for tracking my food but I wish it could pull the tracking info  from my glucose monitors automatically. I also use Medisafe for my prescriptions and I wish those apps would share the data. It just seems like I spent lot of time manually inputting data from different apps. More sharing would be a great feature to add.
53,53,5,2018-08-06T02:42:53.000Z,SueclarkRD,Amazing app for my patients,"I am a dietitian and a certified diabetes educator. This app has all the aspects that help them manage their diabetes. I not only am an educator, but I am living with diabetes also. I am able to use it with my Fitbit and since I have the premium version I can monitor other health issues that increases risk. I recommend it to all my patients."
54,54,5,2018-12-14T03:22:03.000Z,Rosemary4200,Best ever,I used to use this app to track Diabetes stuff then stopped when life got in the way. Forward 2 years and many serious health issues couldn't find any apps that worked.  Then I remember this found it on phone and it is capable of easily tracking all my vitals and meds.  Thanks
55,55,5,2019-01-05T17:22:05.000Z,grannytennis,Diabetic Help,I love the ability to track my carbs in order to keep my blood sugar under control. The camera for bar codes is a big help in checking nutritional labels in the supermarket . Tracking is made easy by swiping same meals and favorites pop up when you are looking for them.
56,56,5,2019-01-11T13:40:08.000Z,dblankenship711,Can’t get right,"After several attempts to keep a daily log of my insulin, food and daily exercise. I finally found something that is easy to use. I couldn’t stand writing down all the information in a journal book. This is by far the best app I’ve used. Yes I’ve tried many different apps as well."
57,57,5,2021-06-30T18:42:23.000Z,Secnav32,Amazing app,"The most comprehensive app I’ve ever used. I’ve used it off and on with a subscription for at least five years. It works perfectly for me. Everything you want to know about creating healthy meals, recipes, learning about macro meal planning, healthy eating information and a super easy way to track it is in this app."
58,58,5,2020-01-31T01:39:57.000Z,rgjefferson56,MyNetDairy Review,"This app is the best app for logging and analyzing food consumption.  My endocrinologist was amazed at the details I provided her. This app should be provided to all diabetics when first told they have diabetes.  Great APP.  The reports portion should be allowed in all levels of the app.  The app warrants a 5 star rating. After using this app for the past few year, I am still impressed."
59,59,5,2020-04-23T13:07:27.000Z,nota4398,Great for diet or diabetes tracking,App is very fast to use with mostly good regular improvements demonstrating the developers consistent commitment to perfecting the app.  App has a lot going for it.  Food database is constantly updating and can be added to by the user making the ability to populate your intake fields extremely quick.
60,60,5,2017-08-10T01:03:03.000Z,Cardinal40324,Learned my lesson,"I started using this app a year ago. My A1Cs were 6.6, 6.8. I got to busy too spend the time to take my sugars and put them in my app. Last week my A1C was 9.6. I am using it again and my average is already 145. This app makes you aware and it will assist you in keeping your glucose down."

Since then, they came out with the pay-by-the-month one which is their NEW all inclusive....seems to me I should have the same access. No way am I going to pay every month, though."
62,62,5,2018-06-29T14:12:59.000Z,jeffran1,Excellent!,Been using the iphone app for quite awhile and really like it. It was very useful in helping manage my type 2 D and now for losing some weight. The GPS tracking while walking is very useful. The support from the team is quick and spot on. Highly recommend!
63,63,5,2018-09-20T14:16:47.000Z,Jlanders21,The Best App I Have Used!,"I have used a couple of different apps over the past three years. This app is the best. It is easy to use, very flexible, and the report information is excellent. It would be easy for me to sell this app. Still true after this past year of use."
64,64,5,2018-10-14T13:26:38.000Z,RDM#2448,Used a lot of programs,MyNetDiary replaces all most all of them. Great app that they continue to make improvements and fix any bugs. They are committed on having the best app out there.

I’m the kind of person who needs to track everything to stay really motivated and this app has been great for that. This app will help me keep the lifestyle that’s keeping me healthy
66,66,5,2018-12-31T21:09:07.000Z,Thepickle223,Great app,"I stopped using the app for two years and gained almost 40 pounds. My diabetes was out of control. I'm back on the app and logging everything I eat, my blood glucose and my insulin. I know that if I stick with it I'll be back in control within the month. I highly recommend this app for diabetics."

68,68,5,2019-11-22T15:38:01.000Z,Slorider2,Best help and app for diabetic tracking,This can be as simple or complex as you want.   It can track almost everything.  Still trying to learn all the features.  Only complaint I have is there not a manual.  It’s trail and error to learn.
69,69,5,2020-04-27T17:54:42.000Z,emelliebear,Goid except ...,"I like and use the app daily, but each time I try and sinc with the online website there is a makor issue!

Each improvement only adds to this gold-star app for diabetics."
71,71,5,2017-09-06T12:52:44.000Z,Lpexaminer9,Couldn't do it without it,MyNetDiary keeps all the information I need to monitor my blood sugar and lose weight. It keeps me accountable. I would caution to be careful with some of the already loaded calorie info. Sometimes it's wrong. But it's so easy to enter the info yourself. I love the barcode scanner.
72,72,5,2017-11-30T01:31:21.000Z,Cowienurse,Kelwee61,"Love this app. I have had a hard time keeping my diabetes under control.  This app allows me to visually monitor my goals, feel good about my successes and work on my failures. Love its ability to read UPC codes.

My daughter was recently diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and I thought this program might be a real help, but finding that not to be the case. Nowhere in the description of the app does it list minimum requirements for use with this app, such as weight. This has turned out to be a real waste of money. Not a very happy customer!"
74,74,5,2018-08-05T23:02:07.000Z,Sharkylady17,Excellent,"It’s been a lifesaver in tracking my blood sugar and meals at the same time.  When I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, I struggled to find an app to do both, and this one has been great.  Love the reminders to check as well as the ability to scan food. Overall, great app!"
75,75,5,2018-08-08T01:10:17.000Z,Young Goodman Brown,Has everything you need,Makes entering data as quick as possible. Food library is extensive and allows you to add custom foods with as much detail as you want. Charts make seeing patterns simple. The more you use it the more useful it is.
76,76,5,2018-08-21T14:13:17.000Z,JohnnyBobo,MyNet Diary Review,"I have been using this app for years to record my blood sugar readings, weight and blood pressure. It is integrated with my Apple Watch and health applications on my iPhone. It has much more capability than I make use of. I would recommend this app to anyone who is serious about their health."
77,77,5,2018-10-11T15:04:49.000Z,Mjw1956,Great way to lose weight and control diabetes,I found logging my food consumption helps considerably in weight loss. This app does it all.
78,78,5,2018-11-25T16:20:08.000Z,MJ in Michigan,Keeps Track of Multiple Health Measures,"Not only does this app keep track of weight and food, this version also tracks blood sugar, insulin, blood pressure, and many other indicators. It integrates with Apple Health and my new DexCom continuous glucose monitor. The charts are a great way to see the trends for the data collected."
79,79,4,2020-01-02T01:37:14.000Z,VACultureJunkie,2 stars are generous,I’ll give this app 2 stars because sometimes it works. More often than not it serves as a way to raise my blood pressure. Changes aren’t saved. Foods only allow certain measurements when other types would be really helpful. I remember now why I stopped using it in the first place. What a joke.
80,80,5,2017-07-13T14:19:04.000Z,Trinity Stitches,Very good app,"This is a very good app, great for diabetics like myself but short on the food choices. If you eat out or processed food it's great but I would love to see fresh fruit by volume and fresh verges by volume as choices. I love the ability to program my own recipes and get the breakdown per serving!"
81,81,4,2017-07-31T19:50:07.000Z,Tracejen,Best I've tried,I have tried several different apps for tracking blood sugar and this one does the most without a sub fee.
82,82,5,2017-08-30T13:45:18.000Z,Momajae,In love,I was hospitalized for the first ever after being diagnosed 11 years ago.  The nurse in the hospital shared this app and I am so blessed to have been told about it.  Everything is so handy and makes the process of controlling diabetes easily.  I like that it is very user friendly.
83,83,5,2018-08-23T11:33:16.000Z,Lucky Law,Life saver,Absolutely love this app. Helps me to track all my progress and keeps me going. The reminders are exactly what I needed to help me stay on track and the food diary keeps me accountable. Great resource. Managing my diabetes would be so much more challenging without this app.
84,84,5,2018-09-09T14:07:15.000Z,Flyer 1234,Best app ever,I’ve used the pro version for more than three years and find it invaluable in managing my diabetes and keeping me informed and aware about the effects of what I eat and how good exercise is  to achieving my goals.

Consider integrating with mental health apps, because we all know your mood and ability to function has everything to do with your overall health (food intake, weight etc)."
95,95,4,2018-07-12T18:09:28.000Z,Do Right Texan,Review,"I like the app for weight control, however I use the app for diabetic control. I got the app because it said it used  Calorie King, however it is only pulling a small portion of the foods from Calorie King into this system. After the most recent update, a lot more foods were added."
96,96,5,2018-11-19T12:29:33.000Z,RageKitten,Using for weight loss,Only been using for a week but very easy to use. Many people have commented that the food search was limited but I have not run into that issue.
97,97,5,2019-02-12T16:57:37.000Z,Rollo75,Great tool,Started using after leaving weight watchers and using their app. This is an excellent alternative and I’ve found it to be very helpful not only in tracking my food intake but also in shopping for healthier alternatives.

103,103,4,2017-10-23T08:23:53.000Z,Klunky2,Best,The best diabetes app I've looked at or used.  Two minor issues keep me from giving it five stars. Accessing the diabetes specific information from the website requires a subscription. There is no way to submit updates for foods with no packaging such as restaurant foods.
104,104,1,2018-03-27T05:59:58.000Z,Wllarsen,Not like it used to be!,"They don’t check ones that customers send in?  I found several things with the same brand and portion with different values. NOT GOOD for a diabetic.  Also they have soooo many (write ins) now you can’t even find the basic stuff anymore. Food check; Scan one, then scan another whole different food style comes.   Reverse to order then the that 2nd one is wrong.  Guess I have to find a new app."

108,108,3,2020-02-10T15:32:20.000Z,starlite09!,Update problem,Normally I would give a higher rating but the latest update has important portions where the text size is so tiny it’s hard to read. Other areas like on the main screen upper portion are too large. Those of with diabetes often don’t have the best eye sight. Please fix it!
109,109,1,2020-02-22T16:33:34.000Z,Wilford Brimly,Not worth it. (My opinion),I bought this app about 5 years ago for $10. Over time they added a premium feature which I am not interested in. Today I got on my phone to check the carbs in some fruit when it now is a monthly subscription only. This WAS the best app I could find for carb counting and diabetes management all in one place. But I don’t want to pay for something Google and a piece of paper can do.
110,110,5,2017-06-27T00:22:52.000Z,Naithom,Life saver,I was diagnosed as having diabetes in January. My numbers were dangerously high. The app has allowed me to cut my glucose levels by 2/3 and drop my A1c in half in three months. It has helped me take control of my condition.

113,113,4,2018-06-22T02:46:35.000Z,taxhelpmi,Good but crippled,I understand that developers would like to sell MAX but they should have enough confidence to not require a diabetic to pay a monthly fee in order to set a goal for carbs after paying for the diabetic version of the product
114,114,5,2018-08-02T05:06:28.000Z,MightyOldMac,Almost perfection,"This App is fantastic. The only things lacking are an Insulin Calculator, and a decent Data Export capability.

I am not going to continue to pay for the maximum and not get the advertized benefits.  I have sent several complaints but have received no response.  If not resolved by the end of this week will unsubscribe and go with a different program.

In order to get functionality for diabetes tracking you have to go premium. It’s a fine app, definitely not worth the cost though. Free apps have their functionality and more."

290,290,5,2012-10-16T15:45:32.000Z,hawk_fam003,Review of Diabetes Tracker by MyNetDiary,"This app was not the first one I used, and approximately 2/3 of the 90 lbs. I lost over the past 10 months was with the other app, but if I had known about this app I would have used it exclusively.  It's accuracy with nutrition in relation to diet, exercise, weight, & calories is the best I have seen so far.  As a result of this app I am better able to manage my tendency towards diabetes, completely eliminated any cholesterol issue, and better track BP, which has returned to normal."
291,291,5,2013-12-11T19:44:59.000Z,Eringatang,Love the recipe option,"This app allows you to store recipes with a total number of servings (or grams). For example, you can save a muffin recipe that makes 12 muffins by entering all the ingredients. Then, when you eat just 1 muffin, it does the math for you to figure out how many carbs you ate based on the total recipe. You can also save you favorite dine-out food as recipes, such as to-go salads --just enter all the ingredients. You can even take a picture of your recipe and save that (though not sure how useful that is). You can copy meals from one day to the next. It has many different ways to enter food (grams, cups, oz, number of (almonds, for example)). It is very useful and has made gestational diabetes not overwhleming. Blood glucose very easy to track.  It took a day to figure out how to use all of the features. They only thing I have not figured out how to do is enter carb goals for all meals, but I am sure I will soon. Very much worth the $9.99."
292,292,3,2014-12-28T18:40:52.000Z,davefwood,"Good App, Laughable Database","The app has lots of useful, customizable features. You can adjust the blood glucose range for various times of the day, so you can create incremental goals and work toward them. You can adjust the proportions of protein/carbs/fats. And their are lots of charts and trackers, some of which are more useful than others."
293,293,5,2015-06-06T10:09:35.000Z,kellylesa,Almost perfect!,"This is, in my opinion, the absolute best food/fitness tracking app if you are also a diabetic needing to track carb intake and BG readings. Many other trackers are available in MND as well, with the option to create some custom ones. I wanted an app with the ability to track BG readings and carb intake (for sliding scale purposes). However, I'm also trying to be more active and eat healthier, hoping to lose about ten pounds. Many of the better health/fitness apps do not have a way to record diabetic related readings, meaning you have to have several different apps and logs going at once, never quite getting a view of the big picture. With this app, you can see everything without having to duplicate your logs in multiple apps. I have absolutely loved this app for the few weeks I've had it."

295,295,5,2016-04-14T00:52:12.000Z,wendyb413,Love MyNetDiary,I am a Type 2 diabetic since 2007. I have never had good control of my diabetes. I went for a check up in early March and my doctor wanted to significantly increase my insulin intake. That was on a Friday. I sulked all weekend about the medication increase. My doctor also wanted me to log my blood sugars for the next few weeks so we could get a better idea of when my high sugar readings were.  I tried writing them in a log book but would forget to write them down or not have my book with me when not at home. I decided to search the apps on my phone and find one that I could use. MyNetDiary is the first one that came up and it was so easy to use. It has helped me keep 80% of my sugars in the green for the last 6 weeks and helped me keep up with my calorie and carb intake. I love how it logs my steps and helps me keep up with my exercise and how many calories I burn in a day.  My daughter started using it to help her lose her baby weight and has lost 15 lbs in 5 weeks and looks great and feels great! I highly recommend MyNetDiary for both diabetics and non-diabetics.
296,296,5,2016-05-04T00:18:15.000Z,20932120123,Adjustable,"This app can be as complex or simple as you want. Keeps me on track and keeps me doing the right things. Have had no issues with food entries but the scanner database seems limited. For most things a word search works fine. Seems to have a lot of flexibility. Buy it, I was hesitant at first but ask yourself how much your meds cost? Isn't your health worth it? Other cheeper apps out there may work but I like this ones interface."
297,297,4,2016-05-22T14:59:59.000Z,Tanken forever,I have used this app along with mynetdiary for well over five years now!,"I find this a very good app for tracking my blood stat levels.  Also I have been using the diet tracking to track what I eat and all the sugars, carbs, and trace minerals.   I have created custom ""foods"" so that I can easily input my MEDS and SUP (supplements). The app is very flexible.  I have also used the integration with my Whitings device and found that useful to see workout (steps), blood pressure, and weight.  There are many table and graphs to look at the stats.  I share my stats with my doctors, and it helps with giving a clearer picture of my diabetes and my progress, or problems when they arise. I use this app on my desktop, iPad, and iPhone, all the instances see the same data almost instantly. I think the use of this app has been a big contributor to my being able to have the doctor reduce my blood pressure MEDS and blood sugar MEDS. Great job developers for creating a usable, stable and well maintained and updated app."
298,298,5,2016-09-07T03:36:03.000Z,K3uk,Lost 40 lbs in 5 months !,"This app started my weight loss when I first used its barcode feature to ""grade"" items I intended to purchase in the grocery store . I initially established a plan to by only products the app gives a A- to , or higher . Sticking to this plan, and entering in the food items I ate each day (with the suggested calorie per day for my goal),  saw some very encouraging weight loss within only a few days .  The initial weight loss then encouraged me to begin to exercise,  and after 5 months I have lost 40 pounds . Within the past few weeks the rate of weight loss has slowed , but it is still going down. The app tells me how many ounces I should lose each day based on the amount of exercise I enter in each day and the food items I track . That part does not seem very accurate since currently it predicts I will lose a pound per day but in reality I am now losing about  a pound per week. It has been the best app of all those on my phone ."

300,300,5,2013-04-06T20:58:24.000Z,laraM,Love my net diary,"Love my net diary - I have tried out a number of calorie counters and found it to be the best. Best range of foods, easiest to enter and can either enter on my iPhone or on the web site at work. Can add common recipes or combinations of foods that I regularly have. Also like that most foods can measure in grams as means it is much more accurate than trying to measure or estimate volumes. I have a good food weigher at home and a simple small weighing device I take in my purse for when on the go. I freeze 100cal veggie sides like creamed spinach in the freezer so they go with my protein meals.  Read awhile ago that they were doing a diabetics app and while I don't have diabetes, I do have PCOS and insulin resistance and I'm trying to eat low GI. This allows me to measure the effects of different foods and motivate me to keep my blood sugar low while I try to give up chocolate."
301,301,1,2013-08-13T21:18:10.000Z,Jbp3191,Caution Pro version is not complete app,"My father has type 2, so I'm looking for an app that will let  him monitor his food, medications, and insulin and send the reports to his physician.   I thought I found it in MyNetDiary,  The app allows input of these areas of concern supplemented by a food item dbf to get your exact foods eaten. The dbf is not complete it, but to be fair that is a huge task. They do allow for manual input and even scanning the labels to send in for I assume a more complete dbf.  My objection and larger concern is the summery of the data which is what one really want to send to their doctor. The Pro app at a high $9.95 gives you the impression of a full featured app with reports available. However once you discover their website and find out they want to sell the reports for a monthly service fee only accessible through their website in what they term the maximum  version/service  you realize the scam. I am appalled that these people would take advantage of people with diabetes in this manner. Because of their sneaky business practices I do not recommend  this app."
302,302,5,2013-12-22T06:36:05.000Z,Ariannaslight,So much more than just a diabetes app!,"Wow. I've used lots of heath and fitness apps with varying degrees of usefulness and nothing compares to this app. The food diary alone is worth the cost of the whole app but add in the charts, ability to track various health items,  email your weekly synopsis to yourself or your doctor, keep track of exercise, nutrients, steps. The daily analysis is one if my fav things. I love how it keeps you abreast of your progress toward your weight loss goal  and the little thumbs ups and downs are good motivators of things you don't usually think about in your diet.  It's totally helped me to stay on track. I check my food diary information before I eat something and definitely alter what I eat based on the info the app provides.   I like the idea of the food score. I haven't ever utilized that but an planning on reading up on it some more."
303,303,4,2014-09-14T15:05:44.000Z,Perrybucsdad,Good but could be better.,"This app is great for helping you track your nutritional info, diabetic info and losing weight.  Since they charge you a monthly fee to use most of the features, I really think it should be free with the very basic tools you get with it for $4.00."

We now have the perfect marriage of applications.  Now I can track the relationship between my diet and my diabetes with one easy to use tracking tool.  Life just got a whole lot simpler.  Thanks to the team!  One request though.  In Tracker I am only able to enter whole numbers for Hemoglobin A1C.  Need at least one decimal place to be meaningful.  Thanks and keep up the good work!
305,305,5,2015-12-11T19:38:02.000Z,Evilmonkee,Love Love This App!,"I was already keeping a very detailed written logbook for months before finding MND.  I wish I had heard/found it sooner though as it would have made my life way easier, even though the habit of writing things out was good.  Helped me to get my A1C down from a 9 to a 5.2 and lose over 120lbs from ~290 to 167.   By just changing my diet and later adding some light exercise, I was able to get off insulin completely.  Keeping track of my glucose and meals is still such a daily routine that I continue to use this app every day and I love how it integrates with my Withings smart scale and OneTouch Verio glucose monitor via Apple's Health app. They seam to have thought of everything when providing the tools to making quick and easy entries. You also can't beat their support team, who are were very quick and responsive to some issues I was having.  A++"

I read the reviews and downloaded this App. It makes order out of chaos. Getting started is very easy: enter height, weight, age, diabetes 1 or 2. It gives recommended daily calorie intake and all other components such as Carbs, sugar, protien... It tracks all information that is available to it, making it an all in one data storage spot. For me: managing my diet would have been impossible without it. It has an extensive food item data base, so when you select an item, all the dietary information comes up and is stored for that meal. For folks like me that never counted anything besides helpings before, this App has been infinitely helpful, to get me started on the right track."

Early this year I got diagnosed with pre-diabetes, and slightly high LDL cholesterol, so I took it upon myself to figure out what I could do to prevent going worse with these conditions. I used MyNetDiary to track everything ate, and also tracked my daily fasting blood sugar and my other regular metrics like weight, BP, pulse etc."

Feeling really blessed that technology has finally caught up for tracking not only blood sugar readings but also the factors affecting them - diet and exercise!!!  I loathe keeping food journals 😡 and always have. This app makes it second nature and fun simply by using bar codes. Even better, if something isn't yet in the database, you improve the app by gathering all the data (took 20 seconds at the very, very most 😄😄😄) and sending it in to be added for everyone using the app!!  I can't wait to see what the next few months will bring and how impressed my diabetes care team will be with the detailed information I'll be able to provide them going forward!!!"

I set my own carb limits and modified the nutrient settings to match my needs which I really liked. Predefined food listing is very good and I have added lots if my favorite brands using the barcode and nutrition scanner which is easy to use. If I know I will be eating out or will have limited food choices I can enter food ahead of time to balance out my nutrient needs for the day. I love feeling in control instead if the food controlling me. The charts are fun to reassure me I am on track. Feeling full of energy, blood sugar in range and lost 27lbs in 10 weeks."

312,312,5,2015-07-07T00:58:41.000Z,Tom Kepler,Great app for a newly diagnosed diabetic,"I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few months ago and began digging around for a good app for tracking my situation. After trying a few that were just fine (each with some fundamental flaw or shortcoming), I tried MyNetDiary. Works great, has a huge food database (I really like the barcode scanner), and it remembers values from one entry to the next (so, for example, you don't have to respecify the time on every element of a meal). There's no one feature that stands out as amazing (except, like I mentioned, maybe the barcode scanner) -- it's just a well-thought-out app with lots of features which all seem to work correctly and quickly. Good stuff!"
313,313,4,2016-01-30T19:11:52.000Z,HannahLooney,Ketogenic dieters friend.,"There are so many food/fitness tracking apps out there and in my opinion they all are lacking in one way or another. As a woman with PCOS who eats a clean ketogenic diet.. I think this app is the best in the market. There are still preset things such as food ratings that give foods a grade (A,B,B+ etc..) based off a high carb low fat rating system.. But if that could be changed because you are using the diabetic settings (to rate food choices based off a LCHF way of eating ) that would take this app to a 10 star in my book.. This pairs with my UP3 jawbone and I can send my food logs to my Dr.. I am very pleased with this app. And so grateful for the excellent and friendly support staff who I can contact through Facebook messenger!"
314,314,5,2016-03-10T00:26:42.000Z,cguandique,What a way to keep up on macros,"Excited I got this app. It tracks your breakfast, lunch and dinner. Input what you've eaten based as oz, grams, etc.. It has the option to barcode items which makes things a lot easier for me. I approve on the grading scale, so when you barcode capture, it'll grade your items. You can track your BG number and amount of insulin; it'll chart out so you'll see a trend in your BG numbers. It records your water intake, which I'm pretty into. Get this app, I approve. The only thing I dislike is that your Fitbit does not connect. You'd have to upgrade to premium for that and I just don't want to do that.  Overall, amazing app for track and record."

My Fitness Pal had a much more comprehensive database that's actually *accurate* compared to this app. Additionally, I'm shocked the food database has basically ZERO entries for meals *without the bun/bread* -- which is something diabetics typically avoid. So I've had to look up nutritional facts from MFP and manually enter the nutrition info from that dang Wendy's cheeseburger minus the bun so this app accurately reflects my calories and carbs. Very frustrating!! If MFP offered blood glucose and insulin entries I'd ditch this app in a hot second. Such a disappointment!"

I downloaded MyNetDiary a few months ago to track foods I eat. With that, I've lost on average 1 pound a week. I downloaded MyNetDiary Pro and loved it even more. now, with the new diabetes version, tracking my sugar is easy and I finally have my numbers under control. It is so simple and is actually motivating. I encourage anyone who wants to lose weight to download the Pro version, and diabetics to download the D version. I just wish I could sync all my devices without having to pay a premium."
321,321,3,2013-02-05T18:42:18.000Z,MountainMan65,"Keeps all your info together, but could be better","I started out using Lose It, but switched to this app to track insulin and blood sugar. For people with diabetes, losing weight can throw everything off.  This app does not have as many foods in its database as Lose It, which was a little disappointing, and the barcode scanner does not work as well. It also doesn't sync with my Withings scale for free like Lose It does. You have to pay extra for that. You pay extra for the diabetes management tools. I wish it would calculate insulin for those who count carbs. It will show you total carbs, but then you have to do the math yourself to figure out the number of units you need to take. Overall, I like this app and would buy it again."
322,322,4,2013-03-10T06:40:11.000Z,Bonecrushboy,All in one,"I reviewed so many apps, I couldn't keep them straight! This is the best for tracking BS, food, and everything else you would need to get healthy. I was recently diagnosed type 2 and have jumped straight to insulin. The app helps me track how many units I am on while I increase to the right dose, it Keeps all of my numbers in one place and is easy to use. The only thing I wish was better is the database for scanning food. It has the scanner, but no database. Maybe they can use part of the fee I paid for the app to buy a database rather than slowly building one. Overall, I have everything I need right here and even pulled it out at my doctors office to give her accurate information. Really great!"
323,323,5,2013-05-01T09:40:45.000Z,Cickes,Well Done,"Literally I never write reviews. This app is extremely compelling, so here I am. I have been using this app religiously for 5 months and I have lost 30lbs. My need for Metformin has dropped under Dr. supervision from 500mg twice daily to once daily while maintaining a 5.8 A1C. My Doctor has high hopes that he can completely eliminate the Metformin.  For the record I have zero self control so I find it amazing that just keeping a log of my lifestyle (calories & exercise) has facilitated this change. My only complaint is the app congratulates you for 3 days of record keeping. This gets a little old when you have been doing it for 5 months."

The data base for standard MyNetDiary is fairly extensive. Then I found this Diabetes version in the App Store and thought it could be of great help."
325,325,5,2015-12-07T20:19:45.000Z,Brenda9995,Greatest App Ever!,"I am so grateful that I found this app. My diabetes was getting out of control and had to make some changes fast. This app made it so easy for me to focus on what I ate and not on figuring out calories and ratios. It is easy to use. This particular app also helped me monitor my fasting glucose levels. In 3 months, my A1C was back to 5.3 and I had lost over 40 pounds. 3 years later it is still off and A1C is down to 5.0. Sometimes, I used their massive records of foods and at other times, I created my own. With their built in scanner, it is easy to scan a barcode and they will enter it for you. Kudos to you!"

329,329,4,2017-04-20T13:15:23.000Z,BigDee87,Life Saver,"This app literally saves my life. It helps me keep track of everything. I would never remember the time I ate and when to test if I didn't log everything in this app. It also helps me keep track of my levels over an extended period of time. Helps reduce the anxiety of trying to have everything under control. I can't even remember how much I paid for this app, but I'd pay it again and again if I had to."
330,330,5,2012-07-23T14:31:25.000Z,PzzDude,Medications?,"Overall this is a fantastic app based on about 1 hour of looking and entering information.  I went into medications and set up all 7 medications I currently take and was given an opportunity to document my use of the medications.  Now, when I choose medications, it takes me to the setup screen only and there is no place to access the medications I set up previously.  Also, the help screen for the medications setup returns a ""This page cannot be found"" error. I hope you can fix these two problems quickly as this is the app I have been looking for !!!!!"
331,331,5,2013-12-17T19:40:52.000Z,Gretchly819,Best Diabetic App!,"I was lucky to have found this app shortly after being diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. It has really helped me to be mindful about checking my blood sugar and tracking what I eat. I've been able to get my blood sugar under control and I've even lost some weight. The graphs are great, because you are able to see trends in blood sugar, weight, blood pressure, etc. They really encourage me to stay on track. It was well worth the $10 I paid for it. I recommend it to anyone looking for a diabetic app that allows you to track just about anything."
332,332,5,2014-07-17T06:09:36.000Z,Mark Microwave,EXCELLENT,"I don't rate very many apps. But I thought that this one deserved it. I have been a diabetic for over 20 years, and have struggled with keeping track of my weight and my medications, etc. that entire time.  With this app, I can keep everything in one place; might weight, my blood sugars, my insulin doses and everything else. I'm always discovering something new. After my last visit with the doctor, I discovered I can keep track of my blood work (A1C and such), which I have now started to do.  I can't wait to see what they'll come up with in the next version."

335,335,5,2015-11-10T12:49:12.000Z,Tntarens,Great app,"This is a great app that helps keep one accountable. My best advice is start slow with using it. You don't need to use all the bells and whistles at once. I started just logging food and glucose testing.  Now I use reminders after meals, sync it to my step tracker, track my blood pressure and weight. The only thing I would like to see improved is a way to change the sound it makes to notify you to test. I never hear it when my phone is in my pocket or not in the same room I am. Minor, but would be nice. Thank you for making something easy to use and helpful!"
336,336,5,2016-01-14T17:42:21.000Z,Dfoote09,So Helpful,This app is so great and has been a so useful in the start of my journey to get my Diabetes under control.
337,337,5,2016-01-16T05:59:44.000Z,Akcitizen,Best in Class,"I either researched or used the key food/exercise trackers.  MyNetDiary Pro and Diabetes versions are the best!  They bring in all major needs, exercise, foods, calorie and nutrient plus macros determination. Along with great extras like measurements and the diabetes version (which I prefer even though I don't have diabetes) adds medication tracking and more granular nutrients and allows you to create trackers for whatever you want (I use it to track meditation, journaling, etc.).  I don't have an add on subscription, but believe if I wanted one it would be well done.  Thank you MyNetDiary for excellent products!"
338,338,5,2016-04-30T12:07:15.000Z,Kingdarlene,Great product,"I have been using this app for over two years now and it has been a great help for me. I have been able to keep track of my sugar, exercise, and blood sugar levels. It has been so easy having the app on my iPad, phone and computer. It even shows you how much you need to exercise to keep on track of your weight loss. I have told friends about this app and now they use it. I even showed it to my sugar diabetic Doctor and he loved the app and all the information you can get from it. He has recommended this app to his other patients.  Thank you for a great app!!!!"
339,339,5,2016-09-18T18:47:35.000Z,Moon over Portland,Pulls it all together,"I had a bunch of apps to track weight and meals. Just used this for tracking my blood glucose. Absurd! Did a search for MyNetDiary versus other ones that are popular. Realized I was missing out by not keeping it all on this one. Deleted the other 4 and starting today just using this. It is truly a dashboard for running your body in a more fit condition. Impressed with how easy to track meals, water consumption, calories burned by exercise, all my medications, my progress on weight loss goal in addition to my daily blood glucose. A valuable app!"
340,340,5,2014-08-07T20:24:16.000Z,SIMON 95,Great app don't know what I would do without it!,I was diagnosed with type two diabetes February 2014 I have lost 50 pounds with the help of this app just tracking the calories and my exercise it's amazing! With this app I am able to plan out all my meals so I can keep track of my carbohydrates and what I'm eating. I weigh all my food and with this app I am able to calculate the carbohydrate count in everything that I am eating even with custom meals that I make myself. The app definitely helps you get accustomed to your new lifestyle change.
341,341,5,2014-12-21T14:56:10.000Z,Mike McFad,My daily go-to diabetes app!,"I spent a lot of time researching diabetes apps, then chose this one over a year ago and have been using it everyday since then. It has exceeded my expectations for diet management (still can't believe how much info they have on foods, food groups, and packaged foods!), lab and exercise tracking, and especially all aspects and ease of diabetes management. It gives me good personal feedback, keeps me on track, and has helped me and my physician meet my DM treatment goals. Thank you so much for a terrific app and being committed to regular updates!"
342,342,4,2015-08-11T06:21:18.000Z,Hooked in GA,Most inclusive app,"I use this app because it allows me to keep track of glucose readings, exercise, medication, and food, and therefore lets me look at possible effects of all those factors on blood sugar. I think the food database is quite good. I wish it would calculate and graph blood sugar statistics by time of reading, though (fasting, after breakfast, etc). Since it doesn't, I use another app for that."
343,343,5,2016-01-02T13:35:33.000Z,StevieAng,"Excellent App, Well worth the money","I'm new to Net Diary, and I already find it indispensable. I often have low blood sugar, secondary to gastric bypass, and have been struggling to find the right balance between protein, fat, and carbs. The simple act of writing down all that I ate has been a tremendous help in figuring that out. The reason it is well worth the money is the included features that other free apps don't have or make as intuitive - a Blood Glucose timer, timing your meals and snacks, and a calorie/nutrient display that is very helpful. This was clearly a well thought-out app. Thank you!"
344,344,4,2016-01-10T07:42:53.000Z,Just robbed,"Without a doubt, the diabetic app your looking for","In October 2015, and as a result of several symptoms, I went into a Group Health of Seattle medical center. By the end of the day I would be in Virginia Mason Hospital with Type II Diabetes: BG, from earlier test was 892, A1C was 15.5%!!!  For those who are reading, DO NOT 'Do the Dew'. Far from disparaging the doctors and nurses at the hospital (Where I downloaded the app), or the encouragement and ongoing direction provided by Group Health, the true trophy goes to this app. Its ease of use and depth of nutritional and medical trackers, along with it's integration to the iPhone health app, provided me the tools and information for the following success.  January 6, 2016 A1C = 5.7% (3mo avg. 117)!"

I started searching for a better comprehensive way to track my overall health ... Diet, food, weight, measurements, BG levels, exercise, vitamins, water intake and even a place to add notes  ...   Much better bang for your buck.   Whether you are a diabetic, pre diabetic .. You customize this according to your own body and goals ...

I've told other friends about it (some with diabetes, some just looking to lose weight).  It's been a Godsend. I can track foods easily and manage calorie and carb intake through the day to assure I stay in line with my plan.  And it's great to check charts to see how I've progressed.  Like the way it syncs with Fitbit too.  This is worth every penny.  I told my wife - I don't know how I'd manage this in days before a digital product such as MyNetDiary."
349,349,5,2016-12-05T11:44:37.000Z,maliVuk,Diabetes Management Assistant Par Excellence,"Excellent app that is an invaluable tool for the management of diabetes.  My doctor is impressed with the way the app shows him charts of my blood glucose, blood pressure, pulse, and weight so he can see at a glance how I have been doing.  The food database is quite comprehensive and easy to use.  I have found that if I don't track my intake carefully, then I drift into a more permissive food intake which inescapably shows up in my charts.  Thank you for providing a way to extend my life, or at least keep me from shortening it through my behavior."
350,350,4,2014-01-12T18:51:05.000Z,RedRider14,Best out there - but still needs work,"I am happy to find an app that allows me to track so many things in one place (food, insulin, BGs, exercise, etc.).  My wish list includes better and fully-customizable reporting so that I can send comprehensive reports to my endocrinologist.  For $9.99 - you get a lot, but the reporting functions are really clunky.  The app is very focused on weight and weight loss - I am looking for something that is really focused on the needs of a Type 1 diabetes patient.  This definitely feels like it is more targeted to a Type 2 diabetes patient."
351,351,3,2016-04-04T16:52:33.000Z,f4_rockriver,Data lost switching from Pro to Diabetic,"Be cautious when moving from the Pro version to the Diabetic version!  Not only did two years of weight history and custom food, recipe, and meal entries not transfer into the Diabetic version, they were also mysteriously deleted from the Pro version. I had/have an online account, but still cannot recover the data.  Technical support cannot fix the issue."
352,352,4,2016-06-19T04:07:17.000Z,big blind jon,Almost perfect,This is the best app out there for diabetics. Tried a great deal and wasted a great deal of money doing so. This one is the best but it's not perfect. It syncs well for me across 3 devices. My problems have been solved quickly by the developers. It tallies everything under the sun for premium users. More than I need but my docs love it. Needs a refill/pill quantity part and a better journal for sure. Maybe a spot for doctors and pharmacy info. Access to contacts. Waiting on an update that might make a better dashboard UI improvements as well. Also needs better integration with Fitbit.

My blood sugar has adjusted enough that it's kept me off insulin and allowed me to drop two of my three diabetic meds. If you really use the app correctly, as tedious as it may seem at first, it will not only help you keep track of yourself, but it will encourage you to keep it up. I can't think of any other way to lose weight and become healthy at the same time."
354,354,5,2016-08-26T10:16:35.000Z,Lwnalow,Beyond helpful and totally worth the cost,"I have a general rule of not spending more than $2 on an app for my phone. In this case I made an exception and I'm so glad I did! After being diagnosed with gestational diabetes I was scared about management and tracking. This app makes it so much easier - all the data in one place! It is fantastic and I'm thrilled I found it. Even better, I plan to continue using this app after my baby is born, in an effort to work toward better health. Thank you for developing it!!!"
355,355,5,2016-08-27T23:56:16.000Z,yellowbird808,Best app for Diabetes tracking!,"I love all the ways you can export data from the app & website. The data displays are very helpful for seeing trends over time. I wish you could select particular display types though, e.g. range charts for monthly glucose levels (instead of scatter plots), but the trend lines are good. MyNetDiary is pretty quick about adding new food to their database using PhotoFood. Also, with the new version, there is better integration with the iOS Health app, so you can read/write more salient data points. Great job!!"
356,356,1,2016-09-17T00:55:36.000Z,Krisakavamp,"Overpriced, not useful for GD","I had high hopes for this app but was very disappointed.  I expected much more for $10.  The database is very difficult to search and the UPC database is extremely limited.  The app tries to set plan guidelines strictly by weight which aren't useful when pregnant, and if you adjust to meet doctor recommendations you are continually told that you need to review your plan.  The chart for tracking past bs counts is just horrid.  You can't compare day to day- it looks like a tangled mess.  It's extremely difficult to compare meals and bs levels to narrow down foods that cause spikes.  And there is no way to create or send a doctor report- not even anything you can screenshot- unless you want to upgrade to their maximum.  Yes, AFTER spending the $10."

Within a week, I started using it for meals, exercise, and weight, too. Great integration with Apple Health. Not the best with the Garmin VivoActive HR, but that's likely Garmin's fault. Could use more water tracking. I would prefer to see full nutritional info on food check, but this app does well, and the food database is very extensive. Great integration with the AccuChek Aviva Connect thru Apple Health. Also works great with the Withings scale, also thru Apple Health app."
358,358,4,2016-11-11T14:27:36.000Z,dgmommie,Great on iPhone but can't get on iPad?,"I bought this for my iPhone and it works great so far. I love what it can do. I used MyNetDiary for weight loss a couple of years ago and it was fantastic. I was excited to see this version for diabetes combined. The description says it's compatible with iPhones and iPads, yet when I search to load it onto my iPad, the App Store cannot find it. It only finds another version that wants me to pay an additional $9.99 to purchase. I want to load THIS version onto my iPad so that the two I have work together the way the software was intended to do."
359,359,2,2017-01-25T00:44:54.000Z,Panda012348,Alright,"I didn't find it to be as user friendly as I would have liked. It would be nice if you could log blood glucose and insulin or medication dose at the same time instead of having to go through two different screens and sections. I was hoping the charting would be better and easier to access from my mobile as well, but that is hard to pull up. Especially in a doctors office on a small screen having a doctor read the stats is challenging. Overall it's great for charting everything, but I was hoping/looking for something a lot easier to use and geared towards just tracking medications and blood glucose."

Everything is stored in one place which we can access at home and on the road. The charts are really helpful too. Also, logging food is amazing. You can scan bar codes! And, they add them for you if your food is not in the database. Such a great tool so far. Hope iPad version comes out as well."

I really like the daily and weekly recaps that give me insight to the foods to avoid and which ones offer benefits. I use this app more than any other app on my iPhone and the results can speak for themselves. My A1C went from 7.4 to 5.3! My eating habits have changed and my mindset has changed. I've also learned a lot about good nutritional value and foods to avoid. I'm so happy I'm treating myself to a trip to DisneyWorld!

I love all of the features that it has available and I use them all!  I would have given it four stars if there was an option for quick add of food for when I want to put in the calories and carbs but don't want to make a permanent entry.    Kudos on the new scanner!  I also like that I can create my own ranges for BG since I prefer to use normal ranges rather than ""acceptable"" ranges per the ADA."

Great App. I now just use it for calorie counting and carb counting but I can also see where I'm not getting enough nutrients. It's also scores your food choices (A,B, B-, etc) and I like that feature. Good app I def would get it again and recommend to other moms going through or that are borderline gestational diabetes."

I have enjoyed seeing results change with the eating habits and exercise routines.  Also helped with establishing percentages of fats to carbs to proteins.  I was able to elevate my carb intake and adjust my fats and proteins concurrently.  Was 254lbs now weighing in at 240lbs by just watching my food intake and exercising.  Best part is checking calorie intake to finding out I'm short one cup of ice cream!

I'm a type 1 diabetic and this is a one stop shop to track blood glucose readings, remind you when to test your BG. Easy way to track your foods for carb counting and insulin records. Huge time saver with such a large database of food plus the barcode scanner. The graphs are also a nice addition. My only suggestion would be an on app calculator so you can calculate your insulin to carb ratio without leaving the app."
372,372,3,2015-11-10T19:33:02.000Z,Kit sulu,Great app just missing some things.,"I wanna start and say this is likely one of the best food diary apps. The only thing it needs to really put it self above the others is more customization on meal plans (I.e. ability to make 5 meals a day) or even set different days of the week with different nutrition goals. I am aware myfitnesspal does this but I do prefer the layout of mynetdiary so it kills me that they have yet to Address these great utility features. Aside from my nitpicking this app will serve you well in your weight loss ventures, it's quick, easy and extremely user friendly."
373,373,5,2016-02-06T17:48:24.000Z,Prarland,Extremely excellent app for someone with diabetes!,"I've used a lot of other apps to record diet and exercise snd this one does that just as well as any other app out there. The really neat thing about this app is how well it keeps track of your diabetic medication, blood sugar, everything. Highly recommend it!"
374,374,5,2016-02-15T19:02:56.000Z,Lola McIntyre,Easy - Pick This First...,"... and you'll never use another. Instant feedback provides informed choices after seeing ratios of consumed calories from fat, carbs and protein. It does the math, even if I eat a nibble of something. Goal setting and later changes are easy. I'm not sure how it can get any better, especially now that it syncs with the partner exercise application. Each week - each month - I find a new efficiency, like the menu feature. (Edition: MyNet Diary - D)"
375,375,5,2016-02-19T19:32:37.000Z,Srimayi,Great App,"This is a great app for anyone who has diabetes or blood sugar issues. It takes a little while to set everything up, but once you get rolling it's amazing how fast and efficient this app is. I really like the""PhotoFood"" option. With this option you can take pictures of products that may not already be in their database (and they have a lot of foods in their database) and they will try and have it entered within 24 hours. What a great idea!"
376,376,5,2016-04-10T03:28:54.000Z,jonathan84,Incredibly helpful,"Since being diagnosed with T1 Diabetes just 7 days ago this app has been incredibly helpful. Tracking my insulin injections, BG, calories, carbs and weight gain has been a breeze with this app. The ability to scan a barcode and have it automatically add nutritional information makes the app very useful. I showed the report functionality to my diabetic educator and she as very excited to see it. Highly recommended and worth every penny."
377,377,5,2016-04-28T16:47:52.000Z,Risingsun124,Diabetics Check This Out,"After trying another app which has a lot of great ratings, I found it was outdated and tedious to use. Don't be fooled, this app is far superior and much easier to use. I am using it to track my blood glucose, meals, exercise, weight, and medication. This app makes it a breeze. The nutritional information has the most entries I have found, and for the foods not in there, it's easy to add. This app is definitely the better choice."
378,378,4,2016-07-12T13:47:36.000Z,lammk,Best for diabetics,I used to use a different app on my phone until I found this. I love it !!!
379,379,5,2016-09-16T15:59:00.000Z,lolacolores,My friendly guru,It is so helpful to organize all that has to do with my metabolic issues. The food database is so complete or easy to add custom information. The glycemic grade  has helped how certain food is bad for my system. I wish to understand how it merges info with ihealth like the Pro Version. It would be better if the syn with ihealth gets more efficient. I don't understand why the diabetes version doesn't sync with ihealth as the Pro one. PLEASE WORK SMOOTHLY WITH IHEALTH... please
380,380,5,2015-03-14T03:52:45.000Z,rctsiel,Excellent program,I am a software design engineer and this program is about as good as one gets. Both the iOS and the Mac versions are fantastic. Diabetes module is well worth the extra money if you need it. This program has helped me lose over 20lbs and get my blood sugar stabile at a normal level in only two months. My doctor was blown away at the details and information available in the reports and charts. Highly rated!!!
381,381,5,2015-03-21T00:06:07.000Z,AF7GIANT,Great app!  Covers all areas of diabetes management,"This app covers everything.  I can plan my meals and snacks for the day.  I can plan my meds, vitamins.  I can log all of my glucose readings so that when I go to the doctor, I just hand him my phone and let him scroll thru.  The only thing that could beat this is a watch that measures glucose.  I've also used Glucosuccess but it's not as thorough and depends on multiple apps whereas this is everything in one."
382,382,5,2015-03-23T00:39:23.000Z,Magnifisweets,Extremely useful,"I have used this app for years--upgraded to the Pro version, and then recently upgraded again to the diabetic version when I was diagnosed with diabetes. I use it constantly, and find it so helpful for tracking daily nutrition, charting progress, and making meal choices (I love that it gives me a letter grade for food items I enter!) Great functionality and great features like UPC scan to capture nutrition info. Highly recommend!"
383,383,5,2015-04-12T14:03:25.000Z,JABFroggy,Best Diabetes App,"I tried several of the more popular diabetes apps for meal and blood glucose tracking before making a decision about which to use. This is by far the best, most comprehensive, and most functional. The food database is unparalleled and constantly being updated (I can even submit a new food), the recipe creator is great, the user interface is intuitive and informative, the reports/graphs are fantastic.  The app syncs with all my devices and iCloud. Fantastic!"
384,384,5,2015-11-11T05:41:41.000Z,barkerm79,Best App I've Used,"I find this app extremely easy to use. Until I found it, I was using 3 different apps to do everything that is included in this one app. Tracking exercise in one app, glucose tests in another, and water consumption in a third. I am glad I paid for this app. I enjoy the ease of adding new foods not in the database. You can't go wrong for the money if you are a diabetic, an need to track these things as well."
385,385,5,2016-01-20T20:25:09.000Z,Layna bug,Worth every penny,"I am a mom of a newly found diabetic, and all the things that we have to keep track of this app has. Everything that we were worried about knowing for carbs this app solves it is amazing. I love everything about it. And it really help since my daughter and I are still new to all of this. And it helps that everything is logged in my phone so I can look back on it and let her doctors know how she is doing."
386,386,3,2016-03-08T03:57:18.000Z,JustSumGuru,☹️Monthly cost for activity tracker sync 😡 :(,MyNetDiary Pro paid for.  Then I was diagnosed with Hyperinsulimic hypoglycemic diabetes so I paid for MyNetDiary Diabetes because this form of diabetes is hard to manage with the roller coaster ride of LO/HI bG.   Exercise usually sends my bG readings low so I thought if I can track food/carbs + bG from CGM + activity from Jawbone UP maybe I can figure out what is and is not working for me.  But the monthly price of linking my UP account to this app is a barrier. Not happy about the monthly subscription.  Please offer a one time low cost or offer this feature free please.
387,387,5,2016-03-12T12:43:55.000Z,User@home,Very helpful app,"This is the best overall diabetes monitoring app I have used. I would like to see it get easier to put in my own recipes. Because of dietary restrictions, I bake with non-commercial blends of GF flour, and cook many non prepared foods. It is a great app for tracking exercise and intake. I think some markers could be updated. Cholesterol is an arguable commodity, so I cringe at eating eggs which my Dr says are beneficial."
388,388,3,2016-08-11T22:34:38.000Z,PictureLarry,Upgrade to max,Awful..... Lost data.... Customer support is responsive with answers but no help in substance. Find another app..... I use this app every so often and then realize it's not a long term solution seems like I'm always loosing my history. After all the input time I wanted to printout reports for my doctor.... I upgraded from D version to Pro.... That did not support proper printed output. So I'm in the max version now. Lost all my medication tracking and parts of the app did not set up... Then I lost my D version.... Disappeared! Forget this app and move on.....!!!!!!!!
389,389,5,2016-12-31T17:22:08.000Z,Lynnhawaii,Lost 60 lbs and losing more,"Lost over 60lbs logging in all of the foods i eat along with my fitbit. It also helps me to track my blood sugar level with the chart via subscription. This is a great app but even better when you get to utilize the maximum subscription. Although i was hesitant about subscribing, it was all worth it for my health. I just got diagnosed with diabetes and am trying to reverse it with a healthy diet, exercise and this app."
390,390,5,2012-09-16T21:35:38.000Z,ColleenJJ,Thank You : MyNetDiary Pro & MyNetDiary Diabetes,"I began on March 26th 2012 on just MyNetDiary. I absolutely love it! I became Type II diabetic and needed to loose weight. This App has totally helped me in getting my weight into control. I have since lost 35# and now am using MyNetDiary D to record my glucose numbers and I absolutely love the charts and continue to have the incentive I need to continue in a healthy life style. Thank you, my life has changed to a healthy future!"
391,391,2,2013-04-23T00:11:08.000Z,rlsandifer,Disappointed,"I spend a lot of time entering good items. Having to enter all the nutritional information for almost every meal is a pain. After months of using this product I have only found three items linked to the barcode and the nutritional value was wrong on two of those. At first I took time to send pictures and barcodes in for updating, with the promise they would be. Well, they haven't been.  This app is not all it promised to be! I wish I could get my money back. I would go back to my fitness pal if it had a way to track blood glucose."

393,393,5,2015-11-13T01:05:16.000Z,Dbr3,Excellent App!,"I use My Net Diary. For tracking food. But also I use it for tracking my blood sugar, weight, water, as well as my own custom trackers to help me keep on top of my cancer treatment, helps me stay on the lookout for developing side effects of medications, I have to watch out for-that could require hospitalization, such as rise in temperature, reactions, or blood in urine when taking blood thinners, etc. This up date has improved performance."
394,394,5,2015-12-07T16:40:58.000Z,Dawn Y,So glad!,"I've used the original app before and it was great! I had my diabetes well under control until about 2 years ago, life circumstances spiraled! Anyway, when my husband went back to tracking his food, he told me they came out with this version! Doing the happy dance and keeping it in check now! Once you get it set up and have recipes, repeat meals, etc... entered, it's awesome!"
395,395,5,2016-02-12T14:42:26.000Z,rusticmodern,Keto and Diabetic Awesomeness,"I first got this app to track keto carbs and then I also saw the blood sugar monitoring and tracking. Not only can I count carbs and calories, scan labels, track water glasses per day and weight, but I can add multiple blood sugar readings per day! It has charts and even reminders. I am really happy with this app as I was really trying to lose weight and track my macro nutrient ratio. Get and make it a part of your lifestyle!"
396,396,5,2016-02-20T03:19:29.000Z,renetmyers,Excellent for Type 20,"I rarely write an app review, but I have great respect for this one. It covers every area of the disease that I can think of. It keeps me accountable and honest. Seeing my numbers along with the other data helps me notice things I would not if I weren't keeping track. It's easy, educational, and I share the info from here with my doctor as it is most accurate. I highly recommend it!"
397,397,5,2016-03-05T14:47:13.000Z,Bejayk,Great app,Has new features that I still have to try since I just got the update but I am very pleased thus far.  I mainly use it for logging my blood sugar and that is a great help for me.  I also use it for weight and am very pleased so far.  I'm getting more into it and can add more information as I go.
398,398,5,2016-05-02T23:04:36.000Z,Alixrod,Review,"As recently diagnosed type 2, I really appreciate the simplicity of this app. Especially the food selections are vast and the charts. I love that it remembers all my favorite foods and quantities and it is easier to just select and not time consuming. I like the reminders and the analysis, charts and so on. My doctor that I visit loves to see my blood sugar charts and of course helping me count carbs more importantly and cutting bad calories. Learning so much everyday."
399,399,2,2016-06-11T13:09:24.000Z,tereza_artifex,Unsuited to serious eaters,"Main flaw is that people like me who never eat convenience food and seldom eat out have to struggle to find foods in long unsorted lists of branded items and restaurant portions. Consequently, it's impossible to easily enter everyday ingredients in a recipe, so customization is cruelly difficult."
400,400,5,2013-09-07T23:33:05.000Z,Mama Dob,MyNetDiary DiabeticVersion,"I love MOST aspects of the app. My criticism is that the Pro Version is $3.99 compared to the $9.99 I paid for the diabetes version, AND it has functions that this one does not (better exercise tracking)."
401,401,5,2013-12-19T16:33:26.000Z,Tullamore_dew,Thank you for the great app!,"I used it to loose 40lbs and get my type 2 diabetes under control. It was instrumental in helping me achieve my goal, and inform my PCP, Diabetes Nurse and Nutritionist.  I now experience normal blood sugars with just diet and exercise and am hopeful that, with the help of your app, I can maintain this for the rest of my life. The diabetes tracking features are great, and really differentiate you from the pack - keep up the great work!"
402,402,5,2014-02-13T18:39:58.000Z,JeannaHarrison,Fantastic app!!! Worth every penny!!!,I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and was looking for something to help me stay on track. This is the only app that allows you to scan food into your log (like my fitness pal) but also allows you to monitor carb intake and glucose levels as well. Best $10 you'll ever spend! Even has reports to print or email your dietitian!👍
403,403,5,2014-04-19T13:44:44.000Z,Stellie951,Best Diabetes Teacker App,I have type 2 diabetes and I'm young and need to keep my diabetes in track. I test 3 times a day and log my weight as well. This App is very helpful for me to show my doctor my progress or if my blood sugars are high and for how long. It was well worth the money and is a valuable tool to aid in diabetes care. I highly suggest that if you have either form if diabetes that you get the App and use it daily.
404,404,5,2014-08-24T14:54:05.000Z,Gary 301,Excellent app,"I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes three months ago. It is by far the best app I have found to help me track my diet, glucose, and weight. I wish they could add a function to the fool check tool that lists the total carbohydrates in the item being checked."
405,405,5,2015-12-21T15:20:17.000Z,Crashsolver,Wonderfull Ap,I am A newly diagnosed diabetic. Using this app has helped me beyond measure. For the first time in my life I have to track my food intake and watch many things. This app has really helped me to stay on track. It has helped me to understand my habits and to adjust. My doctor looked at me as if I had two heads when I came to my appointment armed with all the information this app has to offer.
406,406,5,2016-05-21T13:43:41.000Z,Bret Maverick,I live my life with MyNetDiary,This is the best app I have used to control my diabetes. It tracks everything from medications to how much insulin I used. It will also tell me how many carbs are in my meals along with calories and other nutrients. It will also keep track of your exercises ether by manual entering it or going through an exercise app. I would highly recommend this for anyone!
407,407,5,2016-10-06T04:42:47.000Z,caketip,Best app for my diabetes I've tried!,"The app is incredibly easy to use. Reminders, if you want to use them; an incredible database of foods that you can look up and add to; and links to articles that are helpful. The recently redesigned dashboard is a joy! It's nice looking, provides helpful information, and is an easy way to input your information. Well worth the price."
408,408,5,2016-11-03T15:07:49.000Z,iluvpomeranians,Absolutely Incredible!!,I totally agree that it can be as simple or complex as you want. I like details and this app has them!
409,409,5,2016-11-27T18:53:53.000Z,Dodie2all,Great app - just what I needed,"This app is the perfect tool for me, a newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic.  It syncs with my Fitbit, helps me understand carb/protein/fat ratios and lets me know how I'm doing throughout the day. The reports at the end of the week are especially helpful in terms of knowing what to tweak. Tracking blood glucose with labels is an especially important feature for me as I learn what food combinations more adversely affect these numbers."
410,410,4,2014-08-11T16:19:24.000Z,Moné W,Nice way to Track,I really like the new updates of being able to select when I am testing my blood sugars. I love the at a glance charts to see progress and just the ease of being able to keep track of blood sugars and meds!
411,411,2,2015-05-30T16:28:38.000Z,MacFlagg,Not with the upgrade from the other version.,"This company has 2 apps. If you want medication tracking and symptom tracking, you have to get this version of the app, whether you're a diabetic or not."
412,412,5,2015-08-04T22:41:39.000Z,JuliJill,Finally!! Something to make being diabetic easier...,"I've been a out if control diabetic for years. I never really found a groove or an easy place to track diet, fitness, and diabetic info...until. It's simple. Intuitive. Worth the price. My specialist loved it so much she is recommending it to all her patients now. :) Really looking forward to the upcoming Fitbit integration they've promised!!!"
413,413,4,2015-10-12T02:33:30.000Z,poorrabbit,I like this app,Overall this app is very good. The only thing that I wish it did better was provide more food choices especially choice that aren't fast food. Sometimes have a hard time finding exact or even near equivalents. Helps greatly though with keeping track of my diet and being diabetic that is important. Kept my A1c at 6.0 last checkup and this app was a great help. Highly recommended!
414,414,5,2016-03-13T12:17:23.000Z,sunflowers4heather,Most awesome app ever!!!,"I canNOT imagine my life with this app!!! Being able to keep all my information at the tips of my finger is priceless. This app is beyond indispensable! Before I had different log books for blood sugar, one for insulin shots, and another for food. Now everything is in one place and I keep it all updated several times a day. Thank you MyNetDiary!!!"
415,415,5,2016-03-19T16:41:42.000Z,Knudsen Family Plan,Knudscj,"This is a really good app. It is the best I have used. It has the ability to chart the medicines that I take, track my sleep, if I charge the watch before going to bed, counts the steps and exercise that I have done today. There is a recipe that you write down all the ingredients and then you tell the app how much of the serving you have eaten and it calculates the nutrition and calories eaten."
416,416,5,2016-07-03T18:43:49.000Z,GuitaristFret,Flexible tracking with lots of options,"Wonderful app that tracks everything from your blood glucose to your current weight, exercise, food and water intake, medications as well as hundreds more data fields. Customizable and can show graphs of your progress. A must have for anyone tracking their health. Especially useful for the diabetic. Well done!"
417,417,4,2016-09-12T11:58:47.000Z,mwoody66,A good app but rigid,"I bought this to track glucose readings, etc. and it does that well. The food diary is difficult to use in your iPhone compared to apps like MyFitnessPal. The database is meant to be exact but I struggle to find foods and often tap something similar. You do have a barcode reader, and that is great, but I do not seem to use it as readily. Overall, the shortfalls are made up in the value it provides and I use it daily."
418,418,5,2016-10-20T14:59:57.000Z,ednna,Best Diabetes Management App,"I have tried more than 10 apps to help track and control my diabetes. This is by far the best. So easy to track your food, your Blood Glucose measurements, weight, exercise, schedule a BG reading with an audible alarm. It has helped me make changes in my daily life to control my diabetes better, lose weight and to make better choices."
419,419,5,2016-12-31T13:24:21.000Z,LindaCan2,Best of the Best!!!!!,"I'm a Weight Watcher but their app doesn't indicate all the nutrients like this app. This is the most accurate app for diabetics. The food database is extensive and I love being able to scan foods and the way it saves them as favorites automatically. This app works super great and is so economical. I think there are over 750,000 foods in the database. Love it and I never have a problem with it!!!!!"
420,420,4,2013-03-12T14:10:37.000Z,Disappointed in Montgomery,Very helpful tool,"Since I always have my phone with me, I have been able to track calories before I eat. Also helpful to see what foods my blood sugar is sensitive to. You have to become disciplined to entering all the data, but diabetics need to be disciplined with their eating, meds, & exercise anyway and this is a good tool to keep focused. I'll use this app for the rest of my life, even if my Type II goes into remission again!"
421,421,4,2014-02-21T12:37:07.000Z,OriginalBaughb,Good app. Suggestions for improvement.,"I have used your app for every meal for the last month or so. It is good but here are my suggestions. We need a meal summary for total nutrients. We need a way to contact you for suggestions and tech support. We need interface with medical devices to import/export data at least on the web versions of them. Otherwise, it is a good app, as far as it goes."
422,422,4,2015-09-25T03:08:51.000Z,LittleLadyLiza,Almost perfect.,"Love this app, but it's really missing a bolus calculator. Would love to be able to put in my carbs, my current bg, and have it tell me the amount of insulin to take..instead of having to use multiple apps. Also I hate scrolling through to set the time, but I think that's an Apple thing. Otherwise this app is great. Makes management easier to track & simple to show my diabetes healthcare team!!"
423,423,5,2015-12-11T16:51:21.000Z,Diabetes Mgt.,MyNetfiary Plus,"I love this application because it allows me as a Diabetic Type 2 to have all the pertinent information for my dietitian in one place.  I can place my glucose numbers, medications, nutrition information, weight, blood pressure info, etc. and even email her reports and the insulin team so they can evaluate my progression.  The application made my life easier!!"
424,424,4,2016-01-03T21:41:59.000Z,Panolo,Very Good,I have been using this off and on since it first came out. I use it to help me with weight loss and diabetes.
425,425,5,2016-02-05T16:09:56.000Z,Scorpio4230,Great app!,"Makes keeping track of meals, glucose levels, water, exercise, and taking meds easy with audible reminders as well as being able to customize meals and input nutritional info from various sources, for example - Panera Bread, Starbucks, etc. The app also links with Apple Health, can be accessed via the web and uploaded to your health team."
426,426,4,2016-03-13T16:35:16.000Z,SisterDi,Great App,"Overall I really like this app. I appreciate that I have all of the information kept so readily available. I guess that I'm a ""natural"" food nut and a lot of what I consume is not in the food lists so I have to adjust to what is included in their list. I know that there are steps I can take to have that particular food added but, for me, it is too time consuming to do it. No feedback is given once it is added."
427,427,5,2016-03-23T13:25:23.000Z,Higgy- D,A game changer of an app,"Comprehensive, intuitive, smart. Does it all. The food scanner is amazing, a significant time saver. Two tiny little things I hope they work on: one, show fat totals for each meal instead of just a daily total, and two, better graphics on smarter charts. I would love to see carbs, insulin and blood sugar on the same plot. Love this app. Get it."
428,428,4,2016-05-29T15:46:37.000Z,VitaminCeCe,Worth it,I was hesitant initially because of the cost of the app.
429,429,5,2016-09-02T13:03:22.000Z,ERW111,Best All-Around App,"This app is very flexible and customizable to fit needs, especially for diabetics.  It is also good for non-diabetics, as it tracks calories, exercise and nutrition in separate breakfast, lunch and dinner modules.  The end of the day analysis is ver beneficial.  Only con is that it doesn't sync the exercise walking with your phones GPS for automatic exercise updates, but it's easy to enter manually.  Great app!"
430,430,4,2013-01-24T14:06:27.000Z,amatxman,Good but bad food database,"I have been using this app a few weeks now, as it is giving me what I need to track food and glucose.  Very disappointed with the food database.  Most items in it are out of date and incorrect.  You can add your own, but I find it easier to continue to use a free site that I have been using for years.  Too bad the free site doesn't track glucose."
431,431,5,2014-12-29T16:42:29.000Z,Mando Maximus,Works great tracking glucose levels,"This is the only food diet tracker that also tracks blood glucose levels. If you want to see the correlation between what you eat and your blood glucose levels, then this is the perfect app for you. I've made adjustments to my diet to keep my glucose at the proper levels.  And I've lost a lot of weight too."
432,432,5,2016-03-02T12:26:12.000Z,Rod1947TX,Best App,"Easy to use, cleverly designed so you can use only the features you want, and makes recording food, activities and glucose levels in this diabetes version fun!  Indispensable for me--a daily friend that helps me learn how to be healthier with no fuss.  I look forward to making the quick entries and getting useful feedback regarding trends."
433,433,5,2016-05-02T10:45:56.000Z,Febeblack,Great product,I love this app I've been using the non diabetic version for years and just in the last few months switched to this version. I love all the different things you can track in just a single app. I also love the net carbs feature being I follow a LCHF diet this makes looking at my totals super quick.
434,434,5,2016-05-10T16:00:18.000Z,Jena8672,MyNetDiaryD,"I love that this keeps track of all of my information in one place and in a way that is easy to understand.   I love that it connects with my FitBit so I don't have to remember to add my exercise.  The only thing it's lacking is connectivity to my insulin pump so all of that data would auto-enter, also!  Very glad I found this app!"
435,435,4,2016-08-17T04:02:55.000Z,wolfhounds4ever,Fantastic App,"Pretty intuitive and easy to use. Like somebody else said, this app can be as complex or as simple as a user needs. It's a great way to keep track of one's numbers and it's pretty easy to enter in food items. My only complaint is I wish I could print out necessary reports for my doctors in an easy-to-read format without having to purchase a subscription."
436,436,5,2016-11-05T14:44:29.000Z,Mike Goggin,Father,I have been using The app for about 4 1/2 months and have lost 30 pounds. The app is super helpful at staying on track for calories throughout the day and tracking progress as I go along. I strongly recommend this app to anyone trying to lose weight. Watching my diet and exercising every day has been awesome.
437,437,5,2016-11-23T13:44:42.000Z,Splash131,Helps me a lot!,"I can track all my meals. I can add items that don't currently exist. I'm learning to change my old habits and relationship with food and calories. It's important to log everything right before you eat it so that you know how many calories you may wasting to decide, is this worth eating?"
438,438,5,2017-02-16T12:36:43.000Z,BigJim4653,Great,"A must have if you have diabetes and need to lose or maintain weight.  I have used it daily to monitor weight, calories, carbs, blood glucose, etc.  Have lost about 90 lbs. so far and this has been the main reason.  Tied to my scale and Fitbit and this makes it easy to track all key areas.  This is the best app I have found!!"
439,439,1,2017-05-07T03:07:45.000Z,Hal1949,Not really what I wanted,"My diabetes app was obsolete, and thus seemed the best.  Problem:  once purchased, it forces me to enter all foods I eat, and count calories.  I don't need them to do that.  I did it for 30 years as I got fatter.  I count carbs to lose weight.  Counting calories and writing down all foods I eat is what drove me crazy, and I could not lose weight that way.  It made me hate dieting.  Thin people don't do that.  I prefer just entering the carbs I eat as I have it.  Quick and easy.  I"
440,440,5,2013-10-09T16:37:11.000Z,Big_Sexy619,Amazing App,"Really easy to use, and the food database is incredible. Recently diagnosed type 1 in August, have already been able to get my BG levels fully under control and figured out my insulin to carb ratio. I would recommend getting a food scale for the most accurate results, but it's not required. App is the best out there!"
441,441,5,2015-05-29T14:06:49.000Z,Aggressivered,Perfect Health Diary,"This has been a great app for tracking everything I need to cover as I heal up and drop weight. It covers so many things I need to track. Perfect accountability partner. It's worth the money and with the program for PC, I can print charts or use the weekly emails of weekly progress reports to show my doctor how I am doing."
442,442,5,2015-09-21T12:37:33.000Z,DonkMon,My Review/Rave,"I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The diet I was placed on combined with the testing and medications was a bit daunting. Using My Net Diary Diabetes version has made the change in lifestyle much less overwhelming. The constantly updated list of specific foods by brand makes calorie counting easy, accurate, and frankly... Enjoyable."
443,443,3,2015-11-05T16:21:09.000Z,jayserna,Good not Great,"I will say this is a nice app and good at what it does. But missing several easy fixes. First it needs a insulin calculator. You have all the data, just calculate it. Secondly, app needs to read more than workouts on Apple health. My blood glucose, weight, and all body measurements are on health from my scale. Go get it.   Once the app can do this then I will give it 5 stars for sure. But currently needs to use other apps to get easy things done."
444,444,5,2016-01-02T07:30:55.000Z,BipolarWoman,My Best Friend,Love at first entry! I have a terrible short term memory problem. This keeps me on top of all my meds and times.
445,445,4,2016-02-27T03:00:36.000Z,Boxer Music Store,My net diary D,"Love this app!  As a diabetic this is very easy to use!  I would love to see the ease of use of this app work with the max program.  I find it easier to input food and diabetic info (bg, insulin doses, and food) into the diabetic app  than the max app. The max app does offer more more tracking and reports.  Hope an update will allow info to flow between the web max program to the diabetic app."
446,446,4,2016-06-20T23:20:44.000Z,4me2do,Just a few wishes,"The app is great to summarize carbs and get daily views of carbs, insulin, blood sugars and even calories for weight lose. I only wish it would bring I the steps/calories from my Fitbit versus reading how many steps my phone has been on and I wish it read the blood sugars from my accu-check connect. That would make life that much easier! Great work though."
447,447,5,2016-07-02T09:53:49.000Z,Sissy2121,Highly Recommended,"Probably the best app for monitoring your blood sugar. Very easy, precise, and has thousands of foods in its database. Has really helped me keep track of my health. I do feel like it's just a bit pricey compared to other apps but that doesn't make me change the rating of five stars. Highly recommend."
448,448,5,2016-08-17T13:18:05.000Z,Choirboy,Habitually Helpful,This is one of the best apps to track food  and blood sugars.
449,449,5,2016-10-06T12:35:46.000Z,GodB4U,Great app,I have been using MyNetDiary for several years. It has always had great food database. The barcode scanning feature is awesome. The newest update with the redesigned lock it makes the app more fun. I am a registered dietitian and I frequently recommend the app in any of its forms for clients of mine. Nice job with the latest update.

Love it and the fact that it is helping us change our lives. I had open heart surgery 2 months ago, after suffering a heart attack, so a like change was necessary. This app is doing just that. Thanks!"

452,452,5,2015-06-19T19:18:41.000Z,MBO51,Good for new Type 2 Diabetic,It has enabled me to look at my food intake and understand how it affects my diabetes. Tracking food and medications has also enabled me to begin losing wait. The food database is excellent and has led to many surprises about how many calories are in some of these innocuous seeming foods. That has led to better choices.
453,453,5,2015-12-04T01:51:28.000Z,Dazedteacher,Great app.,This app helps me to keep count of all my calories I eat in a day. I love the fact you can scan in information from prepackaged items! I am still learning how to operate all the items this app has to offer! I believe it is one of the best investments in my health I've made.... Now to talk my family into joining!🤗

Will continue using it when I reach my goal! I also use it to track my glucose levels and blood pressure. My doctors are really impressed with how motivated this app has made me. Best advice: Be Honest, write everything that goes in your mouth. Good luck!!!"
458,458,5,2017-01-10T14:24:25.000Z,Mulliman1,Love this App!!,"I really enjoy using this app! It's much more of what I needed for minding my diabetes, exercise and food all in one. Very satisfied! I had to use 2 apps before and the exceed use trackers would sometimes pause while riding my bike or walking and then I wouldn't get the actual mileage and calories burned. So far so good!! 😀👍"
459,459,5,2017-01-27T06:58:47.000Z,JFM67,Great App,This app has really helped me to take control of my type 2 diabetes from when I was diagnosed back in April 2016 at around 550 and now I average around the high 90s to low 100s and I lost close to 50lbs and I'm off insulin.
460,460,5,2015-01-24T13:53:18.000Z,Zebraman69,The last two updates have really improved this app,Excellent app for tracking all the important information I must track to keep my Type 2 diabetes in excellent control. I been using this app since it first came out. It was ok to start now it is great. Easy to use.

I've lost 23 pounds in three months by changing my lifestyle & reducing carbs & sugars and exercising regularly. This app allows me to track all of those metrics & more. Excellent food database & food check scanner. Great job!

I am a thin guy who has never had to watch what I eat or drink so this was hard for me. Though my sugars are still a bit high due to finding a balance with insulin this app has helped tremendously with watching what I eat. Thank you

This app has helped me loose 85 lbs since, stay on track with my insulin and blood sugar and learn more about me than anything I've tried to date. I would highly, highly recommend this app and it's running companion. They are so worth it!"
465,465,5,2016-03-17T11:50:13.000Z,Kimd123,Great and easy to use app,This app has helped me manage my diet and diabetes more than anything else. I am not very tech savvy so what I needed most was a program to help me track my meals and blood glucose levels that was easy to use and understand. This app provides all that and more. I highly recommend.

Only used these apps for 1 week but I already feel like I have both under control and am ready to take control of my life, thank you MyNetDiary !"
467,467,4,2016-10-25T13:39:11.000Z,Monkeyandfish,Useful,"The app is very useful. It helps me keep track of what I'm doing, therefore I am more conscious of what I'm doing. I like that the home screen can be customized so you only see what you want/need to see. I wish there were a couple more things I could do on it to prevent me from having to use other apps as well, but all in all, it's a great app."

I'm hoping this app can help me understand how the insulin works in my body with regard to timing and food choices...my doctor also likes it for food accountability...more later!"
469,469,5,2016-11-22T14:10:18.000Z,Michelle&boys,Great for diabetes and carb counting,"This app is great for the sheer number of things it does. It tracks foods pretty well, has a barcode scanner, tracks glucose and other labs like A1C, tracks weight and other measurements, and helps a lot with carb counting. It is about as good as My Fitness Pal, but has additional features for diabetics. Worth the money!"
470,470,5,2013-02-13T21:36:55.000Z,Hardtack3,Helpful,Really gives you an accurate overview health wise on either a daily or monthly outlook. I only wished it would show you your HcA1 count after 3 months on the Blood Glucose chart. It also helps you excess the changes you need to improve for better health and weight loss.
471,471,5,2013-03-12T11:25:54.000Z,Kandoril,Great App!,"This app has it all for me. One place to manage and record everything I need to keep track of. Blood glucose, medications, weight, blood pressure, diet, and even water intake!  I am strongly considering buying the 'maximum' membership plan online so I can print out charts to show my doctor when the time comes."
472,472,5,2013-10-11T12:39:03.000Z,Billboy47,Well Pleased,This is an excellent program for type2 diabetics like myself. The feedback on diet helps me with controlling the disease. I lost 3 lbs the first week just by using the feedback to modify my diet and am getting more consistent blood sugar readings. Also able to send info to my physician very easily.  Highly recommend this app to fellow diabetics.

474,474,5,2014-09-01T17:28:46.000Z,SONIA KASTNER,Great for Ketogenic Diet (eg atkins),I don't have diabetes but the app is perfect for counting Net Carbs and calories.  Great barcode database and easy to enter foods.  The search tool for foods could be a bit better (results are pretty random) and I'd like to see more items saved to the favorites list. But overall it's a great tool for kickstarting a new lifestyle!

I would have paid five times as much for these amazing features. If you are someone who is serious about your health or newly diagnosed with diabetes this is the app for you.
476,476,5,2015-09-04T17:15:25.000Z,Unclemo305,Almost there,"For a newly diagnosed diabetic, this app has been the biggest aid to me so far. It lets me know or log all of my information for easy reference at the doctors. My only issue is that a few functions seem cryptic and the help feature isn't much assistance. Other than that, I love it."
477,477,5,2015-11-16T00:25:59.000Z,Cuttin' da ropes,Amazing!,"I needed this app and I'm so glad I found it. It lets me monitor weight loss, blood pressure, blood sugar, and most of all carbs and sugars in my food that effect blood sugar. The reports that are available for printing to take to my physician can be detailed or general and are so easy to access/create. It has truly been a life saver!"

The food can be a little frustrating though because when you put in a general food it brings up hundreds of brand names instead of just generic food values. It's still worth it though. I love looking at the graphs and seeing my improvements."

Aside from the diabetes-specific features, it is the best food-logging and diet app - especially since you can enter food in grams which is surprisingly not true of other popular apps."
482,482,4,2012-12-31T11:59:46.000Z,Malakudo,Great app for mobility,"This is a great app if you new to track your calories and nutrients on the go. The online version is not as good though. Anyways, the meals database is huge and you can add your own meals and foods. I submitted a couple of suggestions to their team and they were pretty responsive. I'd say this is one of the best nutrition tracking apps available out there."
483,483,4,2013-04-13T14:12:14.000Z,SuePearce59,Love it !,I like this app a lot. It is easy to use and gives me plenty of data.

Being able to calculate calories burned for any number of activities encourages parties toon in yet more activities. The ability to sync with a meter would really top it off!
486,486,2,2016-04-24T22:39:30.000Z,lewbulldog,Disappointed,"Bought this app because it would let me track my blood glucose as well as my food. It also promised to provide reports & charts I could provide to my physician. Turns out you have to get a ""max"" account to get those features, & that is around $60 per year. Feels like a bait & switch to me. The food database is not as good as my fitness pal. The only real positive is that it does give a good nutrition summary. I'm sorry I paid $10 for this."

It's powerful in that it has lots of food data to utilize, I've only had to enter in a handful of products. It's helped me stay off diabetic medication by tracking my meals and watching my blood sugar."

The BG chart enables constant watch to keep it normal.  I've shown it to all the diabetes coaches and nurses and they now pass it on too.  It keeps you honest grocery shopping with bar scan too.
490,490,4,2012-10-10T10:37:23.000Z,Don Pedro Pagina,Very Good in All Aspects,I have been using this app after using other ones. This one gives the complete package. The food database seems geared towards eating out or buying pre cooked meals. Entering homemade meals takes some patience. Everything else is complete. Much easier than using separate apps for glucose  and diet tracking.
491,491,2,2013-03-08T06:12:35.000Z,AbhiWazer,"Good app, but not worth $10","Does quite a few things but seems like holding lot of features to get you sign up for monthly fee, ridicules. Food database is really poor. Reports and charts are jokes. Hardly any customization allowed. Some free app do better job on this. Only thing I likes it's ease of entering data which is important for doing things again and again. If I get a chance I will ask for refund and use some other app."
492,492,5,2015-03-07T14:37:31.000Z,SRAM7777,Excellent App,I am using this App for monitoring my diabetes for over a year and the updated version along with previous versions were excellent. The weekly overview in the latest version is one of the best features which I am liking it. Keep it up with the good work.

Also, I like how I can list my insulin doses and the charts it creates for weight, blood sugars, and insulin. So far I haven't had any issues with this app! Overall, I'm very impressed."

When any uncertainty of portion, I always 'round up' (cheat and you only hurt yourself).  Great reality check and motivational app.  I have told many friends about it.   Highly recommend."
495,495,5,2016-01-09T16:47:12.000Z,Mikeky11,Life-changing app,Dramatic but true if one is serious about managing diabetes. Some quirks but support has been responsive and integration with website  is excellent. 20 lbs lighter and diabetes under control so has been life changing for me.
496,496,4,2016-01-25T01:09:49.000Z,Michgallo,Helpful,I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes three weeks ago and this app has been incredibly helpful.  This has been a major life change but this app has made it a little easier.  Iran into a couple of problems when scanning a barcode but other than that it is useful.
497,497,5,2016-08-12T12:51:15.000Z,NanaPamB,Big Help!,I really like this app. Many choices as to what you can log! I love the alerts and reminders as well as the diabetic tips it gives you. It works with the health app on my IPhone and with my Apple Watch. It was expensive but so far has been worth it.

Weight, diet, activities, along with blood glucose level tracking covers all the bases. I also appreciate the integration with other apps and tracking devices. My only negative is the cost of the annual subscription. I wish it were less."

But My Glucose readings are not seen on my online account, and I can not print out reports unless I upgrade to a monthly payment account.

503,503,5,2013-09-14T13:20:54.000Z,hansonscott1,Great app,I have been using mynetdiary D since June. It has helped me stay on course with my eating and watching my blood glucose levels. Entering all my food is very easy and being able to watch my carb intake makes all the difference.

509,509,5,2017-02-20T22:10:11.000Z,Jsp8,Mynet Diary,This is the most complete and easy complete diet tracking app. And it has a vast number of food items in its database already and if you need to add a new one it is super easy. This is one Outstanding diet diary tracking app. IMO the best tracker as it even tracks your exercise calories spent.
510,510,4,2012-11-09T13:25:59.000Z,Saymayon,Great,"I like this app a lot. It is nice and easy to use. I'd like to see my Glucose average for a period of time and if it was near the first screen, that would be convenient. I see the average for the day, but was hoping for maybe an average of my choice (2 week, 1 month, etc.)."
511,511,4,2016-01-24T04:32:42.000Z,Riverfly,Almost a 5,"Everything you want in tracking blood sugar, insulin and everything else. Well thought out and complete. Customer service was fast and thorough but the food database is bazaar with restaurant and processed food but basic foods are hard to find. Clean up that and it would be perfect."
512,512,5,2016-02-16T12:10:00.000Z,First Break,Very useful app,"I have found this app to be indispensable in tracking all aspects of my daily health numbers. This app hasit all...food intake, exercise, glucose, blood work, and several other tracking tools. Should be the only tool you need to monitor your health."
513,513,5,2016-03-08T04:42:36.000Z,Mommabear23,Glad I got the diabetes version,"Wow. Glad I moved up to this version.  It allows me to do a very low carb, high fat keto diet and get my blood sugar back down. The Pro version put up a fight about the ketogenic diet parameters, and of course no BS tracking."
514,514,5,2016-04-19T19:02:18.000Z,ZunieAZ,Good Health,"MyNetDiary has very informative tips and articles. After you learn how to use the app, like track what you eat, measurements, and liquids, you  are motivated to improve your life. I like, that you can input your own recipes to keep track of calories/carbohydrates!"
515,515,1,2016-04-29T04:09:21.000Z,"The nickname ""Metalsmith"" is taken, because it's MINE!",Oh?,"Long time later: still doesn't work. They've quit answering my e-mail query's.

516,516,5,2016-07-04T20:05:25.000Z,Chris_Scm,Saving my life!,This app is literally saving my life. I have lost 70 pounds and have got my diabetes under control in a little under a year. I have gone from a HgbA1C of 11 to a 4.9!!! I am off all my insulin now. I give the credit to this marvelous app and it's note taking abilities. Bravo!!!
517,517,3,2016-09-16T12:41:07.000Z,keep the metal,Lack of food info,When I scan some food or enter it manually I expect it to show up or at least be the right food I'm scanning.  Instead I'm having to enter most things manually.  My fitness pal is much better for this where I've never had a problem with foods not showing up.  Fix your database for food & I'll give it 5 stars.
518,518,4,2017-02-10T04:18:27.000Z,CallerSh,Love this app,"I do not have diabetes however i love that i am able to track cholesterol and protein/fat/carbs, i gave it 4 stars because they need to improve the cholesterol tracking, i cant see my old numbers unless i know the day i put them in i think that area can be improved"

Update also says you can turn off the new board if you prefer the old look. I don't even see an option for that to see what, if anything, truly is different. Still love the app. 4 stars"

It helps me track my BG levels and put in what I eat so I know how much insulin to take based on my carbs. Without this app, I wouldn't be able to track anything and I'd be so lost. I'm so happy for this :)"

536,536,4,2016-01-16T11:28:38.000Z,68medusa,Very good,"This program gives you a lot of options for monitoring your lifestyle. I would prefer a favorites list for food and for exercise. It would also be helpful in the exercise section if they included programs from Beach Body and programs like Beach Body. Otherwise, it's very useful"
537,537,4,2016-08-19T23:12:48.000Z,Slikinfinite,I love it!,"It's awesome it reminds me of my sugars it keeps me on track on my cals and food habits, it gives me tips on how I can keep my self in check. Only con I have is that it should up date on the activities and food options for newer restaurants and bars so that the custom part is more accurate."
538,538,5,2016-11-05T16:02:17.000Z,Sellnbrew,Great app for managing your health,I love this app! It gives me everything I need to quickly make responsible food choices. I am prediabetic and trying to live a lifestyle that will keep it that way. I highly recommend you give this one a try.

I like it because it keeps track of everything I need to maintain a health lifestyle as well as monitor blood sugar, blood pressure, medications and diet. The fact that I also know on a daily basis what I lack in nutrients is quite helpful. I'm glad I chose My Net Diary. I love it."
540,540,5,2015-12-16T17:07:08.000Z,Tdsbeat,Very helpful,I have had a much easier time with caring for my diabetes with this app.  Tracking what I ate revealed some surprises.  Sub 7 A1c since I started using this app.
541,541,4,2016-02-26T18:31:10.000Z,Queentam,Really like it!!,I needed to get back on track and during my last couple of appts they were not able to pull the data from my meters so having this was a god send! I would improve by allowing other medications to be tracked in here as well that I take on a regular basis.
542,542,2,2016-04-10T11:56:07.000Z,DZLAYER,Sturdy but limited app,"I have pre- diabetes and I think this app is one of the best tracking apps out there right now. With that said, although MyNetFiary has a vast array of foods it recognizes, for costing an outrageous 60 dollars per year for premium services, it's library of foods is extremely limited. Plus, Latin American popular foods ARE not listed or even recognized and have to be added, and trust we are inputting the correct data there."
543,543,3,2016-05-26T19:35:59.000Z,Word Monster,Good but needs works,I like the app a lot but get disappointed that they cannot keep up the database like MyFitnessPal.  MyFitnessPal has a much larger data base.  I was just looking for a beer I drink and it was not in this app but MyFitnessPal had it and many many many more.  I'd give this app 5 stars if they could get their database up to what is available in MyFitnessPal.

It is not at all user friendly. Entering in the food is a pain and difficult.  Scanner does not work even after paying usd 10. Shame on you. Layout is not good and after using the fantastic app ""lose it"" for carb control, all I can say is this was a waste of money. I don't use it as free apps are better."
551,551,5,2013-04-30T13:42:58.000Z,DONINSEATTLE,Very helpful,"Tried several other apps before this one. This one works, and works well! If you are trying to control diabetes and/or lose weight, I highly recommend this app."

Just wish the food information covered more restaurants.  When I eat out i have to build a recipe from scratch and don't think I get it right many of the time.
556,556,5,2016-03-07T20:47:49.000Z,Extreme Mom,Changed my life!,"This app is the most comprehensive of all blood glucose tracking that I've used.  The daily averages, food monitoring, exercise tracking proved me with a complete overview on where I'm at for the day, week, month and on."

The beauty of the system is that it has all of the important metrics tracked in one app. I highly recommend because good food, exercise, insulin, and blood glucose tracking is the first step to achieving a target A1c!"
563,563,5,2012-11-12T15:17:14.000Z,cmcsan,Great app,"I love this app. It is so easy to track bg's and insulin, including basal amounts.  For a small fee you can view the diabetes charts on the web.

582,582,2,2016-02-20T21:50:09.000Z,stimmy7,Fix this BUG!!!,"I've commented on this 3x over the past 6 months... When entering data, if the keyboard is up and you didn't enter an amount, an error message comes up and you can't see/select ""ok"" because it's behind the keyboard.  The ONLY WAY to get past this is to completely power down the phone and restart it. NO APP should force this action!"
583,583,5,2016-06-10T15:57:25.000Z,a4u,Best comprehensive app,I aM a type 2 diabetic. Money well spent for a professional grade app.  Tried 4 others and this is the best.  Interface is clean and well though-out.
584,584,4,2016-06-21T23:23:03.000Z,Eye in the sky 45,Great app,I love the fact that I can keep track of all the food that I have for my diet. And to keep track on my glucose levels. It's also really awesome that I have the option of scanning the food I eat. I just wish I could give you an A1 C average rating.
585,585,5,2016-07-06T12:49:46.000Z,Rebecca's New 6+S,Great Blood Glucose App!!,This app is the best I've seen. Has everything you could ever want. Food easy to enter. Logging blood glucose score very simple. Uses the app on iPhone and logs all your steps. It's awesome! Makes a dreaded task a little more bearable.
586,586,4,2016-10-04T14:39:05.000Z,Digital crazy,New update,"I have had only a few hours to play around on it, but so far I am liking it very much.  Only negative so far is when listing medicines-it doesn't tell you which med u had.  All it says is one medicine not a big help in an emergency situation."
587,587,5,2016-10-04T19:01:39.000Z,Wamblihowaste,Been there done that,"I have many apps for keeping of food intake. Easy entry. The new interface is great. Why do I use this app, because it also tracks diabetic info. Also. Please make a native iPad app"

589,589,2,2017-06-14T15:06:03.000Z,Hermanmarie13,Great app with some glitches,"I have been using this app for a while now and I love it. However, with the most recent update, I can no longer use the barcode scanner. As soon as I open the scanner the app shuts down. Also, going into a nutritional label on a food shuts the app down. I think I could love the app again if these glitches are fixed."
590,590,5,2012-10-11T11:38:26.000Z,MisophonicMe,Very helpful app,Am new to some of the knowledge needed for managing pre-diabetic glucose levels and have found the app informative and an effective tool in helping me stay on track with exercise and a prudent food choices.

594,594,5,2015-10-18T01:12:49.000Z,MimiAGogo,Fantastic,I have been using this app for years. I love how easy it is to use. Entering  food is a snap. I love the way I can analyze  what I have eaten daily. A perfect food score allows me to duplicate the meal again and know it's very healthy.

596,596,5,2016-01-07T10:37:00.000Z,cowpaintings,Perfect app!,"The calorie counter is so easy to use since you can scan so many foods and get an instant grade rating to make sure you're eating well, and the charts are a great visual tool to check progress"
597,597,5,2016-02-24T04:37:09.000Z,NWnurse1,This app is my new best friend!,"I was recently diagnosed with pre-diabetes and given 1 month by my doctor to get my blood sugar average down. Not only did this app help me reach my goal, but I am losing weight effortlessly by following its guidance. It is awesome!!!"
598,598,5,2016-06-27T13:21:05.000Z,Cdpifo,Pre-diabetic newbie,"This app has helped me to monitor my lifestyle and allows me to make good choices… or bad ones for that matter, I but with this app I know how bad they are. I've never been a label watcher but this makes it easy to do."
599,599,5,2016-11-29T12:12:19.000Z,Jenentonic,I like it better than MyFitnessPal,I am a low-carb/keto dieter and count net carbs and the diabetic version allows me to do that seamlessly. Plus the database is huge so I generally don't have a problem finding what I'm looking for.
600,600,5,2013-01-04T03:14:01.000Z,Coach Garcia,Very thorough app!,"The app will be as good or great as you make it. The app tracks food, weight, blood sugar levels, and much, much more. I highly recommend it. It really is a one stop shop for nutrition, exercise, and diabetic tools."
601,601,5,2013-10-20T03:19:00.000Z,JoeC787,Amazing!,This app has been amazing! It has been great helping me to keep my sugar levels in check. I highly recommend this app if you really want to see what kind of crap we shove into our mouthes.

603,603,5,2016-05-14T16:28:02.000Z,Topolis,Great!!!,"I haven't found anything food / health related that this doesn't track.  I use it to monitor my Type 2, I love how easy it is to add data, track data and get feedback."
604,604,5,2016-06-06T12:19:47.000Z,Andy Kearney,Best Diabetic/ Weight loss app ever!,By far this is my favorite app. I can not only track the foods I eat but also my blood sugars and then can see through charts how what I am eating is affecting my diabetes as well as my weight.
605,605,3,2016-08-05T17:52:04.000Z,Rev Sartor,RevSalt,I like this app but I wish it had a larger variety of foods you can log. The problem now is that you cannot always put in the food accurate because it will not allow you to make any adjustments. I really need it for my diabetes to track my food intake.
606,606,2,2016-09-01T01:11:20.000Z,Gmaz246,Decent app,I think overall the app has some nice features.   I wish they had a larger food and nutrition database.  A lot of times I have to look stuff up.   I wish their blog was more diabetes focused instead of weight loss focused.   And my only other complaint is the cost is a lot higher than many of the other diabetes apps out there.
607,607,5,2016-10-04T16:03:51.000Z,quechy,I use it everyday,"There are many apps that help you chart activities, blood glucose,etc. but I find this is the best app to monitor you diet. It gives you the analysis and it has be pretty accurate. Great app."
608,608,5,2016-10-07T12:42:08.000Z,RichieRich98,MyNetDiary D,"Great for diabetes and food consumption tracking. Can also track blood pressure, heart rate, medications and many others. This app keeps getting better as the developer actively supports this app. Kudos to the developers!"
609,609,5,2016-11-07T15:10:07.000Z,Sherlayne,Life-saving!,"So easy to use; all you have to do is stay focused! (Yeah, that's the tough part.) It's the only app out there that conveniently tracks glucose readings along with nutrition, water and exercise. I highly recommend MyNetDiary."
610,610,5,2012-10-11T14:58:18.000Z,Grannysquare,Best ever,"This is the best ap purchase I've ever made. I use it daily, all day long. Entering foods is super simple. I love how I can track everything in one place and see trends with my blood sugar. It links my Fitbit info too. Love love love it."
611,611,4,2012-10-29T02:46:59.000Z,clholmes55,Great Tracker,User friendly app that tracks everything.  Most foods are included in database. Barcode scanner does not work as well as other applications & adding recipes is more difficult but am overall pleased.
612,612,5,2013-03-21T21:19:51.000Z,tommyg777,Works well!,I like the graphs that it is able to present. It is easy to enter data and I like the idea of entering glucose and several other data items.
613,613,4,2013-08-07T01:33:31.000Z,Cousins Camphouse,New Diabetic,"I was newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes this summer. This app has been invaluable in helping me track my glucose levels & my food intake. Fast, easy, & transfers data between my iPad & iPhone so I can take it with me wherever I go. Love it & highly recommend it."
614,614,5,2014-01-10T23:59:23.000Z,Rheannin,Love this App,I just got diagnosed with diabetes and this app has enabled me to get on track within days. It is so easy to use and tracks everything you need. Highly recommended.
615,615,5,2015-07-19T21:09:55.000Z,Mylilhaybuddy,Excellent App!,Does everything I need it to do. Would highly recommend this to other diabetics or anyone wanting to track their progress.
616,616,5,2016-01-30T14:51:41.000Z,Timecopsgirl,Love the app!,I love the app and have been using it for years (on and off). I only wish they had more 'unusual' types of foods already calculated it. I'm a gluten free vegan and my food choices are not always there.
617,617,5,2016-04-19T14:01:25.000Z,geektothecorenj,Great App for Diabetics,I downloaded this app from the hospital I was in after being diagnosed with type 2. It has helped a lot and now with diet allows me to understand what i consume to manage my diabetes. Great app!!

619,619,5,2017-01-02T23:19:37.000Z,ndls at large,Great manual data entry,"It is very easy to enter data or modify existing data.  Cues for food intake work very well.  Insulin and bg entry is easy as well.  Data export is ok if you want preformatted spreadsheets, but raw data is very hard to get."
620,620,5,2012-12-07T10:37:53.000Z,Ishmiael,Well done app.,I was diagnosed a few weeks ago and this is already helping me. It's great to have your diabetes and diet information in one user friendly app at your finger tips.
621,621,4,2013-02-16T14:48:27.000Z,jauchenbach,Impressive but lacks a lot of barcodes to scan,I really enjoy this app. One of the few to combine diabetes and weight loss. But I do wish it had more foods in the database. And whenever I try to scan a barcode it is not in the system.
622,622,5,2015-02-05T12:28:19.000Z,Ppeenngguuiinn,GRATEFUL!,My A1C went from 9.6 down to 6.8 in 3 months because I could see how foods effected my blood glucose. This app literally showed me what I foods worked with me and which foods were killing me. I am forever grateful for this app.
623,623,2,2015-04-10T15:03:22.000Z,Dann12262010,Thanks...,This app is much improved. It's still stuck in calories which I don't count. I got one whole day logged in before I hit the app's inability to receive my custom selections. I don't eat out. I don't eat prepackaged foods.
624,624,5,2015-08-23T14:09:04.000Z,John3902,Fixed most problems with the latest version,"Excellent app. Does everything I expect, and does it well. Food database a little sparse, but improving."

628,628,5,2016-05-07T20:31:33.000Z,Lkt997,Great app!,Easy to use. Some of food names don't always make sense to me. Mfp has way more food listings. I like this one because I can record my glucose readings and food intake all in one place.
629,629,5,2016-06-25T11:00:27.000Z,Nurse can,Tracking tool,It has been effective for me as a tracking tool for food exercise and water log that's handy and easy to use. Creates mindfulness.  Thanks
630,630,4,2012-08-02T18:50:29.000Z,SnoopyDJR,Very Comprehensive,Being able to track so many things in one spot is very attractive in this App. Thumps up to the dev team. Only comment is on the reporting aspect. Needs work in my opinion. Like everything else it'll get better.
631,631,5,2013-02-03T19:10:39.000Z,Gmoney 913,Invaluable!,I'm diabetic & 6 months post kidney transplant.  I've been using this app since before my transplant and it's been so helpful in keeping track of my changing dietary requirements!  I'm addicted to it!
632,632,5,2013-10-10T04:07:15.000Z,Joguss,Keeps me informed,This app was suggested to me by my nutritionist. The app helps me track and provide information on how I am doing with my goals. I would recommend this app to others.
633,633,3,2015-11-10T12:41:00.000Z,BCarruth62,"Good food app, needs work on diabetes","As far as the food part goes I love the ability to scan in my food and see where I stand on my nutrition. The diabetes part needs work though, would rather see a BG daily graph instead of the sugars being put into time slots."
634,634,4,2015-11-10T14:57:14.000Z,Tnthomy,Money well spent,"Honestly, it is expensive. But it's money worth. I lost 25 lbs with the help of this app. Track all my health facts and print the report (which I'd love to select the reported details a bit better). All around, it's not perfect but close to."

641,641,3,2013-03-26T14:42:26.000Z,Bobby Lange,Great Help,awesome app but the only problem is just about barcode you scan is not recognized but when you search the same food it's in the database 70% of the time so that needs to be updated also I honestly do not think its worth $9.99 way to high a price for this
642,642,5,2013-12-15T13:33:18.000Z,Bearetteone,My net diary,"Great. It manages my diet and I can easily keep track of not only calories but also carbs, sodium, cholesterol, sugar etc. I've been using it for about 6 weeks and have lost over 15 lbs!"
643,643,1,2014-04-14T05:55:35.000Z,DLPM2,Disappointed with Charts,"I upgraded to the Pro version, thinking I'd get some decent charting for my blood sugar levels and a way to email a report. If it's there, I'm not seeing it. I checked out their website and it doesn't seem to offer any diabetic reporting. Pointless to enter all the data if it can't be used to produce a high-low-average sugar chart to help me see trends and adjust my medications."
644,644,5,2015-03-13T15:14:45.000Z,Boston Fan,Excellent,If your diabetic this is the program for you. Don't look any further. This is the perfect program to control your blood sugar and loose the weight you need.

652,652,4,2016-01-25T20:35:32.000Z,Gavins_bat_girl,What?!,"This is one of the best apps out there. However, it has since stopped syncing with Runkeeper. If this is a ploy to get me to spend another $2 to get THEIR activity tracker, no thanks. I'll update when this is fixed."

How in the hell does one enter their blood glucose levels? The main page allows one to enter exercise, meals, steps, water intake, and you can even monitor custom setting. BUT NOT BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS."
669,669,5,2017-01-21T13:31:28.000Z,Will Glasgow,Best diabetic App,"After having tried several helps for keeping track of all the different aspects of diabetes, this is by far the best."
670,670,5,2012-11-08T00:27:56.000Z,Sylvainsatori,Health,Great app does what it claims. Very handy at keeping track of your diabetes. Very easy to use. More food options and restaurants needed. Allow to sync with workout apps
671,671,5,2014-05-01T14:29:30.000Z,Keennon,Very fine program,This is great for diabetes. Well-organized. Huge numbers of foods already entered and very effective implementation of bar-code recognition. Recommended.
672,672,5,2015-04-18T13:03:08.000Z,JenJayTyler,Awesome app,"I love this app. I can track my meds, blood sugar and food log. I can now see my trends and make better decisions about my diabetes and more easily with my doctor."
673,673,5,2015-10-02T02:33:08.000Z,Carl_U,Fantastic guide/teacher,I'm a newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic and this app has been an incredible tool. I learn more every day as I use it and I'm on track to manage my diabetes.
674,674,4,2015-11-12T12:09:05.000Z,Becki P,Very Useful,"Great app. As a newly diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic, I needed help keeping track of everything. This app works well. The charting and reports need to be tweaked a bit... but overall this is a very useful app. I highly recommend it."
675,675,5,2016-04-08T16:06:22.000Z,JerDav67,Fantastic!,First app I have found that will provide all the functions of a daily nutrition log with BG tracking. Also love the email reports.
676,676,3,2016-04-20T03:20:47.000Z,StrongGal,Absolutely depend on it but...,Helped me get my carbs and other nutrients under control. Only problem is the Report which displays many nutrients in % of daily target instead of Unit Weights (i.e. grams). Result is inaccurate tracking of key nutrients like Calcium. What good is a great app if the results displayed are inaccurate?
677,677,4,2016-04-27T12:30:59.000Z,sdwillster,Great app,"This app has really helped me lose weight and get serious about managing my prediabetes. It has a big food database and is easy to use. Together with glucose monitoring, it will help you better understand what foods trigger your highs and lows."
678,678,3,2017-01-04T13:28:19.000Z,Zenmaster6473,2 year review,Overall it's a good app. What I do like is the ease of use. What's lacking is the ability to print reports that may be taken to doctor. Would also like to see a quicker way to enter basic food items into diet quicker.
679,679,5,2017-02-17T00:21:02.000Z,Giffsbje,Helpful,"Very helpful app, one place for everything. I can hand my phone to my doctor and with a swipe she can see it all!"

683,683,4,2015-01-22T15:40:52.000Z,Ljt75063,Disregard previous review,Works only with portrait view. Problem overlay only exists if you try to start with landscape view. App only works with portrait. Not a problem if you're aware of it. :)

The only tiny thing I'd like to see is the ability to have this app sync with my Withings app (wirelessly tracks my weight, bmi, blood pressure, & physical activity).  :)"

700,700,5,2015-06-14T12:35:59.000Z,Clcans,Mynetdiary,This app almost couldn't be better. After they added sugar diabetes it fills almost every diet exercise and medical tracking needed.
701,701,4,2015-06-15T16:51:48.000Z,Nina1011,Love this app!! but....,Just about perfect. Only thing that could make it perfect would be the protein count for each meal (already gives total carbs for each meal and snack). All diabetics know protein need to accompany carbs :)
702,702,5,2015-06-29T01:47:39.000Z,roigearguy,What a great App!!!,"One of the easiest tracking tools I have found for exercises, meds, meals and numbers. And it syncs with health and other Apps. I'm sold on this one!!!"

719,719,4,2016-06-03T11:03:05.000Z,Hthrd,Great tracker,This is a very good app on it's own. I ended up purchasing the additional online upgrade. That way I can print out data for my doctor. Highly recommend.
720,720,4,2012-10-27T19:11:29.000Z,dysartgirl,Very useful,I find it quite easy to use. It is time consuming to add recipes and it would be great to have more health food in the system . Other than that  its a great tool for diabetics.

738,738,1,2017-03-14T00:55:48.000Z,Hyper_Hypo,Doesn't track Carbs.,As a Diabetic I have a need to track Carbs. This app is supposedly specific to diabetics among the other MyNetDiary apps. This app doesn't track Carbs or Protein. You have to pay 60 bucks a year for that. They got my 10 bucks. They won't get any than that.
739,739,3,2017-04-19T16:07:43.000Z,Cheezmover,New version isssues,This is a great app that I use daily. But in the last couple of months the food database is extremely latent. It pauses often minutes before loading food and portions. Please fix this.

751,751,3,2014-01-06T17:04:30.000Z,SPEBQSA,Requires Too Much Data Entry,"App is pretty good, however, information that does not change from day to day needs to be entered daily instead of just entering it one time and having it flow from day to day."

772,772,2,2015-01-28T14:22:31.000Z,RealOldnavy,Camera for reading barcodes not working,"After verifying access granted, camera still does not work in this version.  It worked just fine in the PRO version, but not in the diabetes version"

803,803,5,2015-07-21T03:14:10.000Z,Dok mac,Great,Combines all of the fitness trackers I've ever used. Well worth the price for the use I have gotten out of it.

808,808,4,2016-08-31T17:27:41.000Z,Anniemae55,App rating,Good app but does not really allow for home cooking. It has a lot of restaurant and processed foods in the library. But it does help to keep me on track.

811,811,1,2013-05-28T18:00:28.000Z,Orlando Dude,Save your money . . .,and stay with the Pro. This is tedious and gives you nothing more than having to enter your glucose readings - which you already have on your meter.
812,812,5,2013-10-06T19:08:29.000Z,Toniocon,Very helpful app,"I love this app! Only diagnosed since August, and this app really helps me stay on track. Worth every penny."

814,814,3,2014-02-24T04:40:47.000Z,Tao2005,It's ok,"I am not mocking anyone, but I thought it be neat to have one place to go for keeping track of my diabetes. Nothing wrong with the app. There is no diabetes log on their web site. If there was then I'd rate it a 5 star."
815,815,5,2015-04-20T14:03:54.000Z,Dropkickmaki,Helps a lot,This app helps a lot with tracking blood sugar trends and is great for counting carbs and calories. It's worth the money.
816,816,4,2015-07-08T21:54:18.000Z,The Traveler Is Weary,My Net Diary is a Great App!,Easy enough to use. Could have a better and more diversified exercise log instead of just the distance tracker.
817,817,3,2015-12-06T13:58:33.000Z,Khladams,More choices,Wish there were more choices in the foods section to choose from and more restaurant's with their menu items listed.

819,819,4,2016-04-27T14:11:08.000Z,Occamist,A fairly complete app,This works pretty well. Would that the charting were better at showing trends and averages.
820,820,5,2013-03-02T13:48:24.000Z,PlatWrld,Best App of It's Kind on the Market!!,Has everything that you need to get results.

829,829,1,2017-02-01T23:55:38.000Z,cinguhwk,Total lack of customary support,Their vaunted network ceased working because of an invalid security certificate. To talk to customer or even community forums evidently you need to spend $70 for a subscription. If they cannot keep their security certificates valid I don't trust them with my data.  Anyone know of a comparable app?
830,830,5,2012-12-04T23:35:53.000Z,garciaslita,Best App,"I have been using this app to track my food, weight, and blood glucose. It is a great app. It is very helpful."

835,835,3,2016-05-11T03:41:53.000Z,30yrs Type 2,c,Best App out there for tracking and recording your blood glucose. But is very poor on the food recording side. I have to use myfitnesspal which has a huge food data base.
836,836,5,2016-09-04T19:14:21.000Z,Dr. Loki,I love it,This app works great!  It helps me manage my diabetes as well as my nutrition. Definitely five stars!

838,838,4,2016-10-19T13:10:55.000Z,F4jock@,Mr.,Excellent app especially for diabetics.  The only negative is the library of foods.  There are a number of other apps that have much better libraries.
839,839,4,2017-02-05T20:21:32.000Z,asai,Great App!,Was able to do a food diary for my Doctor. Copy and paste only the food and quantity on a word document.

841,841,1,2013-03-03T17:40:49.000Z,D7e2,Pay a monthly fee??,A nice app until you find out everything online is blocked unless you pay a monthly fee. Reports? Input data online? Nope. That makes all those wonderful reports worthless unless you can live with reports on an iphone.
842,842,3,2014-08-15T18:06:45.000Z,MrReviewGuy,Please just some minor updates,This app has been the best diabetes app I've found. Please polish it a little bit as it's sorta like your other nutrition app. Make it sand out/alone and I say 6 stars
843,843,5,2015-09-30T16:39:01.000Z,richkitty,Great site!,I am very satisfied with MyNetDiary! Perfect for all diabetics that need to keep track. Syncs so well with my iPhone.

845,845,2,2016-03-02T19:56:54.000Z,Jennylynn41576,Not user friendly,Food entry options are not varied enough. None of my local chain restaurants options are available. Even something simple as bacon is not loaded. It's a waste of $9.99.
846,846,4,2016-03-08T19:21:52.000Z,LizFirst,"Like it a lot, but...","Could use more foods from stores like Publix, Fresh Market, etc., from  which to select. European foods as well (German, French, etc..)"
847,847,4,2016-03-12T20:40:32.000Z,jmolyno,Love it,Great app in keeping glucose and insulin on track. Just wish it would incorporate other medications better

852,852,3,2013-12-20T22:49:09.000Z,M&M's in MeMe,New colors,I still like the app but do not like the light green colors and the print is too fine to read. I liked the other format better.
853,853,5,2015-02-06T22:23:01.000Z,j4ck1m,Love this app!,Helps me manage my diabetes! Highly recommend to everyone
854,854,5,2015-07-25T19:06:38.000Z,ICU4EVR,COMPREHENSIVE,Thorough and user friendly. Suggest putting insulin usage and insulin readings on same entry screen. Suggest updating insulin usage to reflect infusion pump bolus and basal usage.
855,855,5,2015-08-17T18:39:23.000Z,ljd317,Awesome App,Tracks everything I need to manage my diabetes. Easy to use.

857,857,4,2016-08-27T13:00:11.000Z,Bbdoll2013,Great App!,Great app for tracking. A little discouraging at times trying to keep on track with it though.
858,858,1,2016-12-11T20:32:47.000Z,Non-yaz,Just don't,I bought it for the BG monitor tracker but to get that feature you have to pay yet again every month. It's very miss leading in the name and description. Unless you want to keep paying I wouldn't recommend this app.
859,859,5,2016-12-31T10:46:13.000Z,Artwjoh,Excellent,The easiest to use with favorites being held in a list

862,862,2,2015-02-09T06:37:48.000Z,Previously avid user,Update has a few issues,"Most notably, I don't want a letter grade associated with my food choices.  The numbers I could at least ignore.  This single issue has me searching for a different app.  Not ok."
863,863,4,2015-06-02T14:02:15.000Z,Jardelavon,Insulin resistant,I'm new to managing my glucose and diet and this app has made it much easier. Would like to see a way to highlight trends in foods that caused your BG to spike.

It's also very flexible and allows me to choose my own portions of protein versus carbs and fat. Another feature that I have enjoyed is the easy servings options. Not a whole lot of math needed just use your number of servings (most foods have had several options: grams, ounces, servings, etc.) having said this I have two complaints:"

1015,1015,5,2018-05-08T12:48:42.000Z,pauliegina,Assign label,"Great app,but please fix the issues with the assign label where it keeps deleting what I write or add.Also if you can fix the issue with the symbols,such as arrows that after a few hours they disappear , and reappear with question marks, basically I use the free style libre which I wear a censor that I scan with a transmitter that tells me my glucose numbers through out the day,which eliminates the use of pricking my fingers,nevertheless the feature which I like is that when my numbers appear after the scan,such as let’s say 120 well it would show you 120➡️ like so with the arrow pointing straight,which means my glucose is changing slowly,there are these arrows ↙️↖️⬆️⬇️ and they mean such as ⬇️ quickly fallen,etc....,etc it helps a lot for me when I log them for the bg readings on this app and easy to see where the arrows are pointing and gives me a better understanding to correspond too what food I ate & why my numbers are high or low & then I can make my adjustments.i notice that arrow symbols or other symbols were working fine about a week or so but after a couple updates,the symbols disappear within a few hours and are replaced with two question marks,?? Hopefully you can resolve this issue,it would be very appreciated ,and again the best app ever,that helps my diebethis effortlessly,which I highly recommend ,thanks again."
1016,1016,5,2018-09-11T07:25:35.000Z,Nmhinca,Outstanding fun app,"I love this inspiring app! It makes real-time tracking of food, exercise, activity, insulin doses & weight so much fun I’m actually willing to do it. Very well thought out and a pleasure to use.My husband became willing to cheerfully control food intake for the first time in his life and has lost 20 pounds! My weight loss is slower but its cute graphic depiction makes it fun to stay on track. Helped us transition from an animal-based to plant-based clean diet and much healthier lifestyle. Highly recommended."

With this one app, and I have tried several, I can track all of the information that I need to control my diabetes! I can let my doctor review it and we can make adjustments as necessary! This is a great app for me! I can also track progress with my nutritionist and make adjustments as needed, also!"
1019,1019,1,2020-04-13T21:11:16.000Z,Munchkin700,price not as advertised,"On 04.11.2020 they advertised a 63% savings.   The statement is next to their annual fee for premium service, normally $59.99.  The ad is misleading you into thinking it is 63% off the annual fee so it should then be $22.20 for an annual membership.    It does not say a a 63% saving as compared to  12 monthly fees."

1022,1022,1,2016-12-18T11:00:58.000Z,Js19670102,The catch,"$9.99 for this app and you cant make it sych with Fitbit?  Yes, this app does synch with Fitbit, but you have to sign up for a Maximim Membership, which is $60.00 per year.  If people are paying $9.99 for this app, surely, build this feature into your app without making people pay $60 a year.  That is nuts."
1023,1023,5,2017-01-24T23:21:46.000Z,Southern Yankee Girl,Very Effective App,"After trying a number of apps, this one is my all around favorite.

1027,1027,4,2017-08-26T19:17:39.000Z,rjrober,Very Helpful,"I find this to be easy to use and I like everything in one place- food, BG, BP, activity, etc. I wish it were more adapted to a ketogenic diet, but it does allow for net carbs or straight carbs. The ability to have foods added to the database with a photo or bar code is nice. They are very prompt. Overall it's helped me lose almost 70 lbs in 6 months."
1028,1028,5,2017-09-01T00:52:38.000Z,Grandpa Buck,Me,Great app just what I had been looking for.still a 5 stars

1030,1030,5,2015-10-01T13:33:20.000Z,LRF91,VERY helpful!  Love it!,I love that you can scan the bar code and get the nutrition info entered into what you ate.  I wish there was a report to print for your doctor of your blood sugar readings.  And that the key on the weight graph didn't block the graph. But it's a great app overall.  Hopefully they'll work on adding stuff and tweaking things.  I'd recommend it to anyone though as is.
1031,1031,4,2015-11-15T16:38:03.000Z,Arago53,Easy to you.,I would give it 5 stars but I have been using it for a little over a week.

This app has helped me to understand what foods make my sugar spike and what foods keep me within the normal range. I've had this app for a month and I've already lost 9 lbs just by logging what I eat and making adjustments. The only complaint I have is that the food ""database"" is limited, but the bar code reader makes up for that. At my two week check up my doctor was so impressed with the chart that he went and got his phone and bought the app on the spot. The nutritionist they sent me to did the same thing. I have found this app extremely helpful. I've read books and know what I should and should not eat, but knowing never helped. Seeing the results plotted out on the chart and seeing how each food impacted my numbers has been a game changer for me."
1033,1033,5,2016-02-13T18:46:28.000Z,johnnyvino,Great App for Diabetics,"I log everything from BG numbers, exercise, medication, vitamins, and all food eaten.  This is extremely useful to me in evaluating any changes necessary to my diet or medication.  Creating your own food categories made it very easy to catalog what I eat regularly and the bar code scanner is awesome.  I also like how I can print out daily or weekly reports or email them to my doctor."
1034,1034,5,2016-03-03T19:23:10.000Z,Csqd,Csqd,"Excellent program to track meds, food and weight. My favorite is the bar code scanner option that allows me to check the grade of foods. [Foods are graded from A to F as to their benefit to a diabetic diet.] I found the same brand of food [such as granola bars] can have varying grades between favors. Also has a food database that can be customized to my diet."

But the food tracker is wonderful and just having to enter everything I eat and drink forces me to eat healthier. Seeing the nutritional values of food lets me make better decisions, and the food bar code scanner is great!"

1040,1040,5,2012-08-26T23:47:21.000Z,leon1965,Comprehensive yet easy to use,"I'm really impressed with the number of tools the app gives you. Starting from easiness of tracking food you consume including a swift bar code scanner, breakdown of nutrition in each food and a specific profile setting for your own needs to a tracking of your blood glucose levels. Great, excellent."
1041,1041,3,2013-03-05T06:57:51.000Z,Imagine iPhone possibilities,Great App but not perfect,Great app that does almost everything you want. Nice reports and extra's to track your progress. Bar code reader should be removed since no food I have entered was found. Additionally food database is poor. Not even close to Livestrong or myfitnesspal. However despite that I would use it over the others if you eat the same foods regularly. If the food database bar codes and all are improved I would easily go 4 and possibly 5 stars! I cut it to 3 due to all the bragging about the food database that was written and for a $10 app the database that was promised should be there.

1044,1044,5,2014-01-22T01:03:21.000Z,The Vexman,Many features but not all work well,"I was hopeful this program would help me and be easy to use. To a degree it is and I suppose as I use it more some entries will get easier. But the big problem is the tedious entry of foods. Making recipes will help some but the bar code scanner is worthless as it requires these 61 year old hands to be steady (which they are not) and then, it dings and nothing happens! Incredibly poor. I previously used MyFitnessPal and I guess I'm spoiled as that program's bar code scanner works instantly in any light or orientation. Room for improvement here."

However, my husband and I are looking to have a baby in the next few years, so I knew I needed to get down to business taking care of my diabetes. I found this app, and I was a little hesitant to buy it, but I am SO glad I did! This app has been fantastic!! I love that it takes no time at all to put in all the information, and I love that it counts carbs for you!! I also love that I can easily send this information to my doctor quickly through email!! This app was worth EVERY PENNY!!"

I logged in using my same username as the Pro but was very disappointed on several points. 1. This app reads and tracks only certain areas of the My Net Diary Pro. 2. My Net Diary Pro does not track anything from the Diabetes app. 3. I paid for two apps that don't merge their data under one app or login even though they use the same login information. 4. I haven't tried going online yet but after this disappointment and expense I'm not sure I will even try. That is what the apps are supposed to do.  I've been using My Net Diary Pro for years and decided to enhance my features. Oops, not! 5. The Diabestes Tracker says its compatible with the iPad but it is old school for viewing. It doesn't rotate. 😣 I it is also old school for the iPhone 6+. I really expected better from this developer.  I'd like my $9.99 back!"

I especially like the analysis and charts. It was surprising to learn the nutritional value of foods. Another great feature is the bar code link so all favorite ingredients can be added to the d-base.  The recipe feature helps track repeated favored meals along with easy editing.  I'm not currently using social media but may in the future. Can't wait to get retested on the A1C."
