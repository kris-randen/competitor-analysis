It‚Äôs very detailed and very informational, it‚Äôs more detailed then the WTE App and it has all kinds of good videos to watch about all kinds of things you will go through during pregnancy, I have to say I like it better than the other one and it goes day by day with my baby‚Äôs growth, not week by week only, it‚Äôs much more detailed and has way more information on it for all of us expecting moms to read and I like to watch the videos and see all the pictures so that‚Äôs a very good thing about it too! It‚Äôs a definite MUST HAVE!! I would recommend this App to any expecting moms, new moms or women trying to get pregnant, it will teach you a lot and it‚Äôs a great way to watch your baby grow and get a sense of what she looks like at this time in your belly, I use this App. Everyday or every other day, there is always something to me reading or watching and it never gets old to me! Thank you for making this App.!!! I love it and recommend to anyone expecting!üíñ Good Luck to all the new mommy‚Äôs out there!!"
1,1,2,2020-08-05T19:50:40.000Z,aliblackburn92,Not correct and keeping track of date and more very disappointed with the app,"I just downloaded this app to track size and the right days and weeks so can keep close eye on how far I am to my due date of March 26, 2021 as of yesterday aug 4, 2020 I was 6 weeks and 4 days I got on it today to see if it is calculating correctly and yet it still had aug 4th when today is aug 5th and so I tried to refresh it wouldn‚Äôt then I went to feedback and settings and back to home page it did end changing the date to correct date which is aug 5th but still states I‚Äôm 6 weeks and 4 days when the correct number of weeks and days for aug 5th would be 6 weeks and 5 days not 4 days for that was yesterday I know I went to my doctor yesterday so it should refresh every day and state correct date as well as correct week and day of how far along I are if nothing gets done about this I‚Äôll recommend others to use an different app and not this one for it lacks right information and doesn‚Äôt refresh like should or when move page up to refresh and I will delete and find an better working app that is correct and works great and does refresh and has correct date and right weeks and days as well as days left til due date too for that effects things like baby weight size growth information and etc if isn‚Äôt correct on weeks days nor the right date and doesn‚Äôt refresh and lacks on the app and it is very important for people expecting to know the correct things"
2,2,5,2020-07-12T22:47:49.000Z,Uwrvryhgh,first pregnancy & looking for a support group? this is the app!,"I‚Äôm 16 weeks pregnant currently & especially with what‚Äôs going on, you can‚Äôt really be in groups and find a great support system. This app makes me feel like I am surround with so many women who are going through what I am going through."
3,3,5,2021-01-19T06:02:25.000Z,Purplgrashoper,Growth Guide,"Since I was pregnant until now, nearly five years ago, and two kids later. I‚Äôve been using this app. The amount of knowledge I‚Äôve gained is so valuable to me, I always share it with my husband and friends. Its made me a more confident in rearing my children and finding what works for us best. I don‚Äôt freak out about much in their development either, because I know what‚Äôs coming. Most of the time my mommy-gut feeling about a growth spurt is on point! However, knowing what behaviors accompany those developmental milestones helps you evaluate what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and feel at ease. Baby Center has helped me understand what my kids are going through and how to help them get through the transition. And most importantly- why I shouldn‚Äôt get so frustrated with them, as its not so easy on the LOs or us. I‚Äôve used this app religiously since they were born, and will continue to for as long as you provide info on their age. I look forward to your emails in my inbox and I try not to skip any, otherwise I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on a gem about my own child. Love you Baby Center, keep up the good work!!!"
4,4,4,2019-07-30T16:35:57.000Z,Aree04,"1 Bro, 1 Sis, and Twins!!","I have been using this app/site for all of my pregnancies. My son (3), my daughter (1) and my up and coming addition. I have become reliant on the information that is provided (even after knowing what to expect) and attached to the support chat rooms. I have found virtually all of the information that I needed with the exception of this...."
5,5,5,2018-06-07T23:00:01.000Z,rs1201,GREAT APP (1st time pregnant),"We are first time pregnant/parents! I really thought this app was great! The milestones that I would personally hit during my pregnancy were pretty spot on according to the week by week notifications! I found it very cute and exciting to be able to see her growth compared to vegetables and fruit during our pregnancy! We had a lot of fun with it! Our daughter was born 2 days after her due date, so we were able to see where we were at each week on this app! I‚Äôm not a huge book person, so this was a much easier way to stay in tune to what already happened or what we could expect to happen! Sometimes we were like, oh that already happened last week or two weeks ago! Other times we would be excited and what was going to happen soon! I thought it was also very helpful because it gave us an idea on what to expect and gave ideas of what to ask the OBGYN doctors and nurses! I have been using it even since she was born and we are going on five months old now! Very helpful app!!! We will definitely use this app for our next pregnancy!"
6,6,5,2021-05-03T14:30:29.000Z,Kelseeyyyyyyy,Free & better than other apps,"Free App, better than the others that charge. I downloaded 5 pregnancy apps and of all of them this one was my favorite AND free. I put it on the home screen while the rest I‚Äôve been checking to see if there‚Äôs anything different and you‚Äôre not missing out on important info by paying for the other ones. I think the information on this app is more positive and correct. I notice other apps like ‚ÄúWhat To Expect‚Äù especially is behind on the latest data and feeds the inner victim/negative expectations around pregnancy that I feel is a marketing tool more than a helpful thing. Things I knew before being pregnant like nail polish is hormone/reproductive disruptive, What To Expect was WAY off on the safety of that and other things and clearly didn‚Äôt do their research when the ingredients are right there for their ‚Äúexperts‚Äù. So I dropped them and went with this app which was the most accurate, positive, informative, and easy to use/navigate. Doesn‚Äôt pop up with annoying ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù prompts either!"
7,7,1,2020-05-08T13:16:50.000Z,üòÅüòÅüòÅddgxhcv,Miscarriage Support,I had a miscarriage and I had to delete my pregnancy from your app. 1- it‚Äôs horrible that the app doesn‚Äôt have any miscarriage support like my other apps do and you can‚Äôt even use the app unless you log that you are currently pregnant. Once you delete a pregnancy it just kicks you out.
8,8,5,2021-06-26T01:59:59.000Z,Domonique üíã,Perfect pregnancy app,"I absolutely love this app!! This app includes a detailed insight of your pregnancy week by week as well as a picture of what your child looks like in your womb. Also, it includes dos and don‚Äôts, milestones during your pregnancy and for your child, and information on any topic that may pertain to your pregnancy, lifestyle, and even your child. I was a first time mother who had just delivered her first child in April 2021 so this app was beyond insightful on everything that I needed to know so and there is even multiple group chat threads that you can ask another mother out there a  or you may just have information that you think other mothers should know without there being any judgement. Even after I had my child, every week I was informed about milestones and information that my child may be experiencing. This app literally has everything that I needed to know so it was the only app I used during my pregnancy, which I was glad about it, and even after I had my baby I continue to use it."
9,9,2,2020-06-17T16:11:40.000Z,Ebil_lightbulb,"Great app, bad ads.","My baby turned one year old yesterday. I turned in the app, excited to read some more but it was still on page 11 month, 4 weeks. No further information, no celebratory message for growing with them for a year, no recommendation for the years to come, no farewell message, nothing. You'd think, if everything comes to an end on the app, that they would maybe give us an ending of some sort? I guess I'll just delete it now. Thanks for being an almost daily visit for nearly two years. Byyye..."
10,10,5,2017-08-08T12:32:55.000Z,Charfauros4,Better than other baby apps,I did my research before downloading a baby app. I'm on my 3rd child and I still found useful info in this app that helped me gain a better understanding of my baby before and after birth. The amount of knowledge that is at your finger tips just within this app is amazing. They really did their research. Everything I was feeling or questioning would pop up as a post right when it should. It was like a mind reader. Really helped me be more confident during my pregnancy. So glad I got this app. My sister had another top rated app and I convinced her to try BabyCenter. She loves this app way more. DOWNLOAD NOW! No regrets.
11,11,5,2018-02-02T18:33:11.000Z,Monakle,Excellent source of information,"This app has been a Godsend for me throughout my pregnancy and during the first part of my baby's life. There is so much information and articles for just about any question I have. I am thankful for resources like this one and wonder how people functioned without them! I appreciate how positive and encouraging the articles are. Particularly the ones about problems. For example, my baby had jaundice when he was born. Reading the article about jaundice on this app was extremely informative and also encouraging. My hospital experience regarding jaundice was not so calm, so having something to read to tell me everything would be ok was very helpful. I also love the polls. It's interesting to see what others are experiencing that use this app. My only piece of criticism is that I wish that the app did not repeat articles so much. Some of the same articles I read during my first trimester popped back up in the third trimester. This is just a minor annoyance though!"
12,12,2,2019-02-07T18:31:13.000Z,truthitis,Eh,"This is my first pregnancy so I‚Äôm interested in all advice and knowledge. I also like seeing what my baby looks like daily. This a personal preference and this app doesn‚Äôt really show images of what the baby looks like daily other than a video you can click on here and there. Also, the forums are confusing, they aren‚Äôt laid out self explanatory. I work in a technology store I‚Äôm actually a mobile expert and the way the forums are set up in the app are confusing. It says start a baby club where you can essentially talk to others, but there is no set button to do so and if you do find where to post it just prompts you to post and you have no idea where exactly that post is going. There are forums on top of forums and really only places to reply to people who have already posted somehow. Idk the interface and display wasn‚Äôt really satisfying to me, i had the app for two days and deleted. I downloaded another app that shows beautiful digital images of what the baby can look like daily and also get advice and talk to others. This app has a good concept but doesn‚Äôt really seem well thought out, user friendly wise."
13,13,5,2019-03-10T15:36:12.000Z,Kymnise,Absolutely Recommend,"This app saved my life.  I was 30 weeks pregnant and I read an article about things to look for and call your doctor.  Mainly about things that may be dangers during pregnancy and call doctors immediately. Well the article talked about swelling and preeclampsia, etc. I had noticed some swelling before and planned to talk with my dr on the next visit.  I was at work and my hands started swelling like the Nutty Professor. Called the Doc, they told me to come in, sent me for some blood work and the next day I was admitted to the hospital.  The article was right I had developed preeclampsia.   I had my baby 2 months early and that was emotionally exhausting but we are both doing well!   I love this app because it is informative and helps get parents ready for baby, explain what you may be going through and helps with questions you may have about your body.  It even prepares you to understand what the dr is talking about.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP!"
14,14,1,2019-03-30T19:45:44.000Z,LeeLee BooBoo,The creators of this tried...,"The women on this app are brutal and extremely rude and insulting and board owners take part in the harsh words as well (they should be neutral and just oversee things, not actually contribute). Wish it was monitored to create a community of support, instead it seems to function more like Facebook for high schoolers because the women feel the need to attack the others (I don‚Äôt have Facebook for this reason). Lots of close minded individuals on here that don‚Äôt know when to keep their one track mindedness to themselves. Besides from the participants of the site, it‚Äôs structured to be a bit more old school in medical information and advice. Not really giving the most accurate info but I guess its based on generalizing anyway in an attempt to appeal to more moms. If your a non vaxer... good luck to you on here. No info is provided about that aspect, only pro vaccine and if you bring it up, the other moms attack. Not really the most pleasant app but I see the good intent and that‚Äôs why I keep it. Good for tracking how far along you are in your pregnancy (which I guess you can use a calendar for). It‚Äôs a good app, but could most definitely use more work."

(I look forward to it so much every morning that I force myself not to look at the next days content, so I have something for everyday of the week). And getting to see where the baby is in development each weak is nice."
17,17,5,2021-08-15T15:22:23.000Z,makndevonfteazye,Single new mom with no parents to guide me,"This is exactly what I‚Äôve needed my whole pregnancy, labor, training etc. I was scared at first when I found out because I don‚Äôt have any parents to teach me to parent and I haven‚Äôt had much of a good influence. I basically just learned what not to do my whole life. But this app really changed that. my son is already 8 months old and he‚Äôs a perfect baby all thanks to this app. Everyone around me says he‚Äôs the happiest baby they‚Äôve seen... Also thanks to this app.... my pregnancy wasn‚Äôt all that scary... Everytime I felt horrible or different I‚Äôd look it up and it‚Äôd tell me it‚Äôs heartburn which means my baby has hair now or some crazy cool fact that made it less terrifying to change in a way like this. It‚Äôs much harder to google things based off of feeling especially when there‚Äôs a handbook for each day right here. Thank you for all your help."
18,18,5,2020-12-06T00:36:31.000Z,Swayyyuhh,I never leave reviews,"dude i love this app. i love learning week by week what our little one is up to in there. this is my first child so i really utilize all the tools, articles, tidbits, and fun facts to be more aware of the little person im growing. i get so excited reading what vegetable or fruit our baby is likened to during that week in terms of size. ive made it a weekly treat for me to wait until the day of each new week to look at the baby's stats and it helps keep me motivated and informed and excited about what to expect! easy to navigate, countless publications from experts and moms, and fun to use. today im 37 weeks (im not crying, you are) and looking back from when i first downloaded BabyCenter, i really appreciate this app. it's actually gotten me through some tough times throughout my pregnancy by reminding me what a blessing and triumph and miracle it is to become and to be a mom. super duper grateful :,) go moms! we're superheroes and dont let anyone make you feel differently!"
19,19,4,2021-08-24T02:44:09.000Z,Noopla48,The Comment Section‚Ä¶,"I really enjoy this app. It has a ton of great Articles, Tip and tricks for First Time mother‚Äôs and mother‚Äôs Overall. It‚Äôs very informative and Provides me with a Comfortable feeling where I Can relate to other Women and hear they‚Äôre stories and experiences. I do like how you can make your own Post and comment on others to spark up a Good conversation‚Ä¶ BUT The comment section is confusing. If I want to reply to someone‚Äôs comment on my post or vise versa it‚Äôs hard to tell which person I‚Äôm replying to. They duplicate a lot of the replies on the same post and I have to constantly scroll through the pages to try and Find the user I was previously commenting with just a few minutes before. They should simplify to a basic Post and have all Replies underneath. That way if I, or anyone else, would like to comment they can just go down and choose to reply to someone specific or on the Post itself. Something similar to what Facebook has would rate this app 5 out of 5 for me!"
20,20,5,2018-05-10T18:55:06.000Z,whatparty,What to Expect from Baby Center,"When I became pregnant I immediately visited the App Store, eager to plug in my estimate due date.  I downloaded three applications: Baby Center, What to Expect and Sprout.  Baby Center was by far my favorite and eventually the only one I used mainly because the search feature was the easiest to use.  The articles feature up to date information based on the latest science based research.  You can also dabble on the more opinion based side and connect with moms around the world.  What to Expect also had these features but I found it difficult to search for information and Baby Center has better SEO so I was often redirected to the app when searching outside of the app using Google and other search engines.  Sprout has a cool graphic of a 3D baby and a nice journal feature (except it will delete your journal in error!) but not worth paying for and it lacked the community."
21,21,5,2018-06-17T11:51:08.000Z,Jade B Wise,This is THE one!,"It was hard to decide which pregnancy and baby app to go with. Baby Center has clearly been the right choice. It has taken me successfully through pregnancy and early parenthood, so far. The articles and information are always right on time, according to what I‚Äôm experiencing and wondering about, each week. I love knowing exactly what was going on with my baby and body throughout pregnancy. And now, the benefit of knowing what to expect and easing concerns about my baby from day 1, has been immeasurable. Knowing what skills to expect to emerge each week has really allowed me to support and foster my baby‚Äôs development in a powerful way. Even the chat room for my birth month club has been so very helpful as we explore and vent and share experiences and are reminded that we‚Äôre not alone. If you‚Äôre looking for a phenomenal, all-inclusive app for pregnancy and parenthood, look no further. This is it!!!"
22,22,4,2018-09-03T03:35:03.000Z,51moonbeam,Awesome Pregnancy App,I love watching the baby grow part of it and how it compares baby to a food and tells you the main things that are happening on the inside with baby that week. I also love all the different articles that you can read everyday. Some of them are very helpful. One this I wish this app did have would be a check list of some sort for new moms that suggests when you should do things by certain time that someone may want to do like take a prenatal class or have a hospital bag packed. I know they have articles and videos on that but an actual checklist where someone can see what is left to be done would be nice. Possibly a baby item checklist too. I keep trying to write out lists of what we need and forgetting where I put them or forget certain things to put on the list. But overall I love this app and I would recommend it to anyone who is trying or already is pregnant if they want to learn more about pregnancy.
23,23,5,2018-10-08T17:57:10.000Z,Pelicanness,My second partner during my journey,"My husband (and first partner) and I love this app. It has been extremely helpful, giving us great information and even peace of mind when needed. Tracking my progress as I go along and providing detailed descriptions and visual effects of my baby as he/she is growing week by week. We love this app and would happily use again in any future pregnancies. The access and connection with other mothers proves helpful and eases my worries. I was able to find helpful links for the registries and sign up for various amenities like blood cord registry and free breast pump through insurance!"
24,24,2,2019-09-16T02:58:57.000Z,Lllaaamarneris,Not well organized and hacked,It gets two stars because I like the community but it‚Äôs not well organized. It‚Äôs hard to follow threads and it‚Äôs hard to find different groups and it‚Äôs hard to go back and see a comment that you made. It doesn‚Äôt show you your comments. It just shows original posts that you‚Äôve made. It won‚Äôt let you erase notifications. That would be helpful so you can delete the reminders if there was a TROLL on one of your boards. Oh it also doesn‚Äôt consider photos of discharge as inappropriate. In glow they require the poster to mark the photo sensitive so those who WANT to help the person out and view the photo can click on it. But in baby center you‚Äôre forced to look at it which stinks because sometimes you have to scroll past to find an old comment. I also think it‚Äôs hacked. Fake ATT winning spree things keep popping up INLY in that app then shut down everything I was working on. I have an iPhone. It‚Äôs pretty well protected and I don‚Äôt have that issue with any other app or even online. So that needs to be fixed. The app needs A LOT of help
25,25,1,2019-06-22T11:27:02.000Z,Mermama28,Horrible app DO NOT GET!!!!,"This app is not good. Cyber bullying is encouraged on here!!! The actual baby center community guidelines are not followed and the group owners since they are not paid will pick and chose who to support even if another member literally harasses you and attack you. And even when they admit or see violations by these bully‚Äôs they literally do nothing about it. They allow the exact same ones to bully the ladies here and they go back and forth to different month boards bullying others on those too. Nothing is done about it. Their customer service will ignore you and your concerns and only responds with a short reply when you end up having to resend email over and over. Horrible customer service and horrible set up and a horrible place for moms who need support as they end up getting harassed, torn down, belittled, insulted, judged by the bully‚Äôs baby centers support and back up. I will be sharing this info on my social media as well to warn others not to get. I will be using other pregnancy apps to support my pregnancy with fair guidelines and not ones that are made to treat others with discrimination and unfair treatment."

27,27,5,2020-09-01T19:12:55.000Z,rfrenan,one of the best baby-parent apps out there,"I got so encouraged with what I had grasped through this app with my first ever parenting experience that I‚Äôm now planning to develop something similar for Azerbaijani mothers (that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm from) in a native language so first time moms and pregnant women know how to take care of themselves both for the sake of their own and their to-be-born babies‚Äô health. sometimes hearing the stories of women who didn‚Äôt know they needed to be putting more effort to calcium or high in fiber food intake and are now struggling either with bone weakness or hemorrhoids - is making me appreciate what people at baby center  (and text for baby organization which sends couple of text messages with important info throughout pregnancy) do! thank you all so very much for helping all of us stay knowledgeable, healthy and happy and contribute to giving birth to and raising a successful baby with sound health!"
28,28,1,2019-12-21T14:34:23.000Z,LMD983,Glitch with Bumpie (Update),"*I did contact babycenter customer service, however their reply was not sufficient and did not help troubleshoot where to find my bumpies. Instead, they provided the same things I‚Äôve already tried. I still have not been able to locate my bumpies. I left another message for the developer and I am still waiting for a reply."
29,29,2,2020-02-08T20:53:35.000Z,YTK Review,Good App- Negative people,"The app itself is very good for Moms who like to read information about their baby and pregnancy. It‚Äôs very helpful. And even after you have your baby they continue to help you and give you updates on your newborn and as your child progresses up until they‚Äôre 1 year old. The only thing I would say steer clear from are some of the forums/groups. A lot of them do tolerate bullying/ harassment and the Admins don‚Äôt seem to care. The Admins literally take side with the bullies and ‚Äúkick out‚Äù the person that is being harassed. If you post something in a group that isn‚Äôt necessarily of the ‚Äúnature‚Äù of what the group is meant for , they will all shun you and tell you that your question/ post is dumb and that it doesn‚Äôt belong in their group, and they basically berate the other person completely to the point where if the poster defends themself they start getting very nasty. I do not recommend this app for a first time mom-to-be in a sense of getting advice from other moms. Be very careful or you could become one of their victims."
30,30,5,2017-10-25T15:04:32.000Z,leilih,Very informative,"I like this app and the weekly alert I get on the progress of my baby‚Äôs growth. The tools in this app are awesome, the Name Finder is my favorite. I haven‚Äôt had to use it yet, but I‚Äôm sure the Kick Tracker will come in handy later. I love that you can save your baby names that you love and see them all together without going to a separate file. The many different lists of name categories and their rankings are also handy to me. It‚Äôs where I found my girl name (and I love that it‚Äôs very unpopular). But I should say, while the name is ranked with a popularity number, when compared to the US social security website, the rank number is quite different. I‚Äôm assuming Babycenter is ranking based on Babycenter User‚Äôs name choices, and not the actual US population. If the popularity of a name is important to you, I‚Äôd check the SS website for truer numbers."
31,31,5,2018-11-03T00:36:59.000Z,Ashlie and Joey,Phenomenal App,I absolutely adore this app!
32,32,5,2019-06-07T06:57:35.000Z,tweikert,A great resource,"Before our baby was born my wife and I were feeling pretty overwhelmed with the shear number of baby books and what seemed like a daunting amount of information we needed to learn, however, after finding Baby Center and getting their week by week updates, it really helped condense things so we could understand what was happening each week without getting too far ahead of ourselves. At each stage of our pregnancy and our baby‚Äôs development we have felt informed and confident and have started really looking forward to reading about what‚Äôs going on each week so that we can adjust our parenting accordingly. Additionally, the parents forum is a great resource any time we have any questions or concerns, especially since it is broken up so we can read posts from parents with babies the same age as ours."
33,33,5,2019-09-07T10:09:48.000Z,Hbgdncr,FTM,"I really like this app. The week by week information is really helpful and I like the fruit comparisons. One of my favorite features are the ‚Äútools‚Äù. That helped me with my birth plan, and kick counts, plus who doesn‚Äôt like to look back and watch their tummies grow?! It‚Äôs also really nice that it transitions over to after the baby is born. I think a lot of FTM‚Äôs have a lot of questions. At least I do! I have a suggestion. I have quite a few apps for pregnancy but not one of them has the option for a preemie. I had to be induced at 34w so my son is 6w premature. All of these apps including this one just gives newborn information. It would be helpful to have the option to see how things progress for preemies. I understand everyone‚Äôs situation is different but a general idea or at least links for articles would be nice. Also, can you add more stickers for the photos?"

I use it daily and it honestly brings me so much assurance & sanity during these hectic months of being a new mom. I initially downloaded it to learn about the different stages of pregnancy I was going through. It‚Äôs extremely informative and helpful. I enjoyed taking and creating weekly baby bump pictures through their baby bump tracker. Now that my baby is here, and I‚Äôm a first time mom, I‚Äôve found the community of women on this app INCREDIBLE!! I LOVE having a ‚Äòbirth group‚Äô of women who had children the same month I did so we can ask each other questions about anything (I didn‚Äôt realize his vital this was until having my son!). The amount of expert content and articles is great as well. It‚Äôs a well rounded app and really all that you need to stay informed and have support! Thanks BabyCenter!"

From topics like their health, general developmental abilities (fine motor skills, milestones, temper any, things to possibly expect, appetite ideas, how to prepare for potty training, you name it. And although now that I have 3+ kids, I‚Äôm not able to read the daily mail weekly, I still look back to them for insight form time to time, because they‚Äôve proven themselves true, and foundational for moms who need all the ‚Äúsolid‚Äùinformation and help they can get."

However, there are a few irritating problems with the app. For example, if you reply to someone‚Äôs comment on a conversation thread, it boots you all the way to the end of the comments. So then you have to go back and try to find where you were if you want to read anyone else‚Äôs comments that came after the one you commented on. Another problem I‚Äôve encountered is that it‚Äôll say that I have new notifications, but when I open the list of notifications none of them are showing new comments. EVER. Even when there really are new comments on the conversations I‚Äôm following. So that‚Äôs annoying."

The website is very informative and keeps you up to date with the progression of your pregnancy. I love the daily updates of where my baby is growth wise. The groups are great and I enjoy the community. You can join a birth group for your due date and talk with other women who are due the same month as you! It‚Äôs awesome to have when you need to talk to other women going through the same situation. There‚Äôs a ton of other groups to join and there‚Äôs so many different options on this website and app! You can even take pictures of your bump and the babycenter app has a section for you to keep track of your bump growth along with cute little stickers you can add to your photos!

Don‚Äôt understand why it can‚Äôt keep me logged in like any other normal app. What information on this app can possibly be that sensitive that it requires a login every time? Sometimes don‚Äôt even bother which is sad cause as I say the info is usually interesting but have other apps with similar info."

The app has a lot of great features, but it feels so outdated. It‚Äôs not fluid. It seems like I‚Äôm on a mobile version of the website, instead of what should be an easy, beautiful app experience. These problems are mostly within the ‚ÄúBirth Group‚Äù area and forums. It‚Äôs not easy to go back and forth between posts, it makes a separate window pop up when I go to the second page, and from there I have to carefully remember to press the back button, instead of the X in order to not jump back to the beginning. Finally, if I make a comment on a thread that has multiple pages of comments, I‚Äôm brought back to the first page of comments even when I wasn‚Äôt done reading through them. It‚Äôs just overall annoying. I‚Äôm only staying for the people in the community. But honestly, what‚Äôs different from the app and going on the website from safari on my phone? Nothing."

I feel like crying cause I didn‚Äôt save them in my phone, only the app. üò≠ I couldn‚Äôt log into the app because everytime I tried it said ‚Äúyour session has timed out.‚Äù I had never logged out of it so I don‚Äôt know why it wouldn‚Äôt let me log back in and I know me email and password were correct. Well it finally let me log in and I don‚Äôt know why but it thought that I had my baby already and just switched to newborn mode! It showed my due date was my birthdate?? Like what???!! Cause I‚Äôm still pregnant at 40.5 weeks. Anyway so I tried fixing it and deleted my due date cause thought that was the problem and checked my bumpies and now they‚Äôre all gone. All 40 weeks worth of pictures. I wish I had saved them on my phone, but I didn‚Äôt and now can‚Äôt get them back! It even lost all the baby names I had saved and my birth plan sheet.

I love the week to week, daily updates (also via email) and all other helpful information/articles. I‚Äôm not too big on the communities as it‚Äôs a lot of chit chat and I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs organized but if you‚Äôre not into that and only into the information it‚Äôs great!

It gives you so much information and also has group descussions. This part is important: Every week it tells you about different things and changes in your body and when I say they are spot on... Its so spot on that its scary. One day it would say that your gums may bleed a little more while brushing in the week your in. The day I read this... I went to brush my teeth and they bled for the first time! It was crazy. It made me feel so much better and at ease, being a first time mother. Pregnancy can be very weird and scary and this app will help you so much! After your baby is born, it is also spot on. Tells you all about your baby, feeding, diapering, changes, ect.

This app provided me with information beyond what I was expecting from videos, to pictures, to several articles and answers from doctors. It also has little fun surveys from other moms you can answer as well as a section to take pictures of your baby bump. :-) At 22 weeks this app has answered many questions for me and has been accurate in just about everything I have read. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to monitor their pregnancy process."

I sent what was probably a harsh email, complaining  about how this makes for a less than desirable experience for me to use the app. I‚Äôm happy to say that they responded in the way most companies do not these days. They put me, their client first. They responded extremely professionally and said they would put effort towards updating their stock images to help show more diversity. Since they I have seen a variety of moms and dads from all backgrounds and I love it. It is now an app that is representative of what America looks like.

But all of the updates from BabyCenter walked me through my pregnancy, plus I was grouped in a community of expecting moms with the same month Due Date, and I found a lot of support and guidance especially from other experienced moms. I really liked this community a lot better than the What To Expect app. Now that my baby is almost 5 months, I continue to get support and guidance, tips and tricks and milestones from the community! The only negative thing I can say is that some of the ladies on the forums can be a little mean sometimes, but it‚Äôs kind of expected when you put a bunch of hormonal or pregnant women in one room üòÇ"

The articles and videos really help me understand what‚Äôs going on in my body, what to expect each week, and what I should and should not be doing to have a healthy pregnancy. I find the tips from real moms and experts to be most useful...it makes me feel like I‚Äôm part of a community and that I‚Äôm not alone in this journey.

Tracking my babies development has been my favorite. However, I had an issue where I had to download the app all over again, which I didn‚Äôt think would be a problem considering I have my own sign on where all my personal information is kept. When I signed back on after re-downloading the app, every bumpie I had taken was gone. Everything else on my account was there, but none of the bump pictures. This was heartbreaking considering this is how I was tracking my bump pictures. I guess I trusted the app too much and should have documented each on my own also. Luckily I have most saved, but have no clue which week was which. Really disappointing, and not sure why that would have happened. Other than that I do really enjoy this app."

Then it helps you learn how tour new baby is doing developmentally, showing certain milestones to expect and helpful tips on things to help with colic and gas, and helping new parents know things will get better. They also have groups for parents to support one another, tracking systems to keep track of baby‚Äôs growth.

I‚Äôve recently gotten into the ‚Äúbirth club community‚Äù where other moms post their questions/comments or are just looking for a safe space to vent. I‚Äôve noticed a lot of people putting others down/spreading judgment. I wish they had a way to clean up this sort of thing. There‚Äôs very specific women on here who‚Äôs names seem to pop up on EVERYTHING that seem to always be looking for a chance to knock others down, and it quickly becomes moms ganging up on other moms. Maybe that‚Äôs just the internet and I should get off, but I don‚Äôt think it needs to be this kind of environment.

It seriously broke my heart because now I have nothing.. not even one. I don‚Äôt get the purpose of making an account if the pictures will get deleted once you log off.

Once I downloaded this app I truly fell in love with it! Not only was I able to track my pregnancy and see how much my baby was growing from beginning to end but this app had so many answers to my questions. Also I love the fact that I was able to take pictures of my pregnant belly from 9 weeks pregnant up to 41 weeks pregnant. The transformation is truly amazing if I must say so myself!

There are so many videos and articles that really help throughout the entire pregnancy. My favorite part is the Bump Gallery. You can‚Äôt take a photo of your bump every week and upload it into the gallery to see them all together. I recommend this app compared to the others I have tried. However, I do use one more (Ovia Pregnancy) and that‚Äôs because they let you track your moods, weight, doctors appointments, and many more things that Baby Center doesn‚Äôt offer.

I love how each week of pregnancy they explain to you what is going on with both you and baby - or babies in our case - we‚Äôre pregnant with twins. They also provide perfectly timed articles and to do‚Äôs for things you should be getting done during each trimester and tips/advice for things you may be experiencing. The only thing I would like to see added to the app is the ability to view and track a twin (or more multiples) pregnancy. They do have information on twins but not on a weekly basis.

The interaction with other moms is a great network and easy way to meet other women that are going or have been through what I am feeling currently.. I love that it shows me how the baby is growing and the different changes we are both going through during pregnancy. it is so educational and allows me to connect with other moms to be and learned abo their current and previous pregnancy experience which helps ease my anxiety as a first time mom!

At the beginning I was amazed how accurate all the info is here- the growth of each body part, the symptoms, the advices and videos are all great. Then my son was born and again the information about his development stages and advices kept everything in tact for me. In all honesty, I followed my motherly instincts more than any advice but I had the piece of mind that I can get the information from a trusted site. At times motherhood could seem overwhelming but this app shares other moms‚Äô experiences, which shows you that you are not alone and helps you keep your sanity."

This app has condoned several women to attack my inbox on my views constantly for 4 days about abortion. 45 notifications total. I was  clearly reflecting on my past decision NOT TO ABORT MY CHILD. There were a series of malicious words these women had when I only said why are you challenging someone‚Äôs integrity about something and being combative when you could just ignore the ignorance. More women reported my comments and keep inboxing me. I just gotten over horrible morning sickness and was fighting it for 2 weeks. Then I get on this app to have a little closure just seeing my comment that I didn‚Äôt kill my child. Then I get bashed for it. Don‚Äôt to get involved with these app Groups and discussions some people are not willing to take it but they can dish it.

My only complaint is that there isn‚Äôt an option for a multiples pregnancy. This is my sixth pregnancy, so it‚Äôs nice to have as a reference, however this time is a twin pregnancy... so in a lot of ways it‚Äôs very different. It would just be nice to have that option to add 2 or more babies to help track weight and growth. Thankfully I have a great team of doctors to help with all of my questions as a lot of the information on the internet can be very scary when dealing with a multiples pregnancy.

The information provided was real, legit, and easy to understand. The groups you can join also provide great members that can answer any questions you have. Some members however can be a little not so great but its easy to block and report, so no hassle there. The tools within the app are so handy. For example, when keeping track of your pregnancy the app has all kinds of stickers that allow you to share/ show the growth of your little bundle. After your baby is born the app then helps keep track of your baby's age and and still provides developmental milestones as the child grows. It truly is the best baby app ever."

Everything use to be week by week and you scroll down daily and there is a bunch of different information along with videos etc, now after you make it to the next week of your pregnancy you see all the information on the first day than there‚Äôs nothing there the following days to scroll down and look at... I enjoyed looking every day to help pass time and be reassured now I have to wait every week or go ahead and look for the future weeks(which is no good because them them weeks of your pregnancy come you‚Äôve already saw it)."

The community boards were a great place to talk to other moms especially about concerns and insecurities, it‚Äôs nice to know you‚Äôre not alone. And it‚Äôs been great post pregnancy too it has some great articles and a great search a fine for first time moms. I have the what to expect when expecting book and I‚Äôve definitely done more reading on this app than in that book. And it‚Äôs nice for picture tracking too unfortunately my phone broke 3/4 through my pregnancy and my photos didn‚Äôt back up on my icloud and I lost all of my bump pictures but it also has a feature to take monthly pictures of your baby as they grow which I really like."
78,78,5,2021-04-07T20:09:48.000Z,BananaWink,4 pregnancies all with this app,"I love the updates! They remind me of symptoms that are normal and things to make sure I‚Äôm doing to get ready. Some people may think this is only for that first baby but I feel like the reminders have been just as helpful in the following pregnancies. I will have 4 kids under the age of 5 come September so the more helpful tips and reminders the better haha. The mom group is awesome! They keep updating you as your child grows and those mom groups that were expecting at the same time as you are now raising kids the same age as yours and struggling through potty training with you which has been awesome. I highly recommend this app it‚Äôs been so great, I can‚Äôt say enough good things."
79,79,5,2021-01-03T14:38:08.000Z,AKAvisory,Love the content,"The content of the app was very helpful throughout my pregnancy and is proving to still be helpful now that I‚Äôve given birth. The only negatives I would say are the structure of the discussion section and the polls. The discussion section is full of so many ads that scrolling through a conversation is a little annoying. I prefer the discussion section on the ‚ÄúWhat to Expect‚Äù app. While the polls are very helpful and a nice feature, I find that the majority of the time, the app freezes when I try to answer a poll and I have to restart it only to find that sometimes my answer was recorded, other times it wasn‚Äôt. Other than that a great resource for expectant and new moms. Would highly recommend."

Ive learned so many exciting things during my pregnancy. I've tried other apps but this one has always been the best. Every week you get videos and tips for your new little one. Theres a mom center where everyone gathers and shares advice or answers questions you have, you can ask literally anything because someone else is going through or has gone through something similar. It's great to have the support and advice from res doctors, plus it‚Äôs full of tons of ideas. Absolutely love how much this has helped me with my first baby, I‚Äôll use this as long as it‚Äôs available to me"

I asked my OB‚Äôs office which app I could trust, they said BabyCenter and I haven‚Äôt turned back since. This website and other mothers who use it have been my go to for information for my children and myself for both of my pregnancies and one miscarriage. I continue to use it and feel it‚Äôs very important to keep up with developmental stages for my almost 3 year old and 4 month old. I was paying for access to work out videos until I realized BabyCenter offered a wonderful series of videos for the post partum body. I would highly recommend this app and am not sure how others get by without."
83,83,5,2019-03-28T02:59:36.000Z,TozziC,Absolutely love this app!,"By far this app has more helpful articles than any other baby/parenting app I‚Äôve tried. I love that the articles are short and to the point, and each one is has their source cited. I can literally search any subject and there‚Äôs videos, testimonies, charts and medical studies right at my fingertips. I rely so much on this app for those articles as well as the interactive features like the calendar! It‚Äôs my electronic baby book. I also love the growth chart tracker that I can fill it at each pediatrician appointment. I absolutely recommend this app to any new family, or those expecting their little love! I can always rely on this app for have the answers I‚Äôm looking for in one place."
84,84,5,2019-05-03T12:45:43.000Z,Maya0056,Before and after,"I found this app 10 years ago when I first got pregnant with our oldest. I loved reading about our baby all thru my pregnancy. Lots of helpful information. Then 8.5 years later I used it again for our second baby. This time I showed and taught my first born all about babies. She loved watching the videos over and over. She would ask every week, what fruit or vegetable her baby sister was (it was a never ending joke to her, saying I was having a leek or a squash etc). She went to Dr appointments with me knowing exactly what was going on and what to expect and now that ‚Äòher baby‚Äô is one, they are the best of friends. This app helped start a beautiful relationship between my girls."
85,85,5,2020-05-20T17:41:48.000Z,sierracece321,Amazing App,"When trying to get pregnant for two years, I used many apps, but this one was the most accurate on the dates.  It was also a great resource to refer back to with the million appointments asking when the last missed period and other dates were.  It was also great to refer back to, to see what the symptoms should be during each week. It has so much information and other mothers to help to solve the worries that may come up. Now my baby is 3 months, and it tells me the baby milestones now.  It is so nice to read what I can expect! I definitely would recommend this app to anyone that would just like the extra info and sources to help when trying to conceive."

My account was blocked for defending another mom who was being bullied about her race by saying my account was blocked and they are ignoring my requests to remove my information off the site."
87,87,1,2021-01-19T19:48:42.000Z,Cjampunk,Don‚Äôt read articles by their ‚Äúexperts‚Äù,"The app is good for keeping track of where you are in your pregnancy, and has some useful tools like the contraction timer, but the articles are basically useless. Anything on there that has anything to do with nutrition is both laughable and maddening. I don‚Äôt know how many I‚Äôve perused about baby and toddler nutrition that are still pushing you to feed your baby a low fat diet. It‚Äôs no wonder childhood obesity is such a problem in this country. Then they have geniuses like Kate Marple, one of their ‚Äúexperts‚Äù, who also wants you to put your toddler on a low fat diet, but also sneakily tries to convince you they need to be vegetarian as well, while advocating for super high sugar meals consisting of nothing but frozen vegetables and ‚Äúwhole grain pasta‚Äù. The other health related articles are not much better, but these nutrition ones are absolute garbage, and only helping to ensure that half this country remains diabetic and pre-diabetic."

We were able to see the size of the baby click on the pictures with the little ‚Äú+‚Äù symbol and learn so much about what‚Äôs going on inside during the pregnancy. It also gives us amazing articles to read that are full of information and tips to help you throughout your pregnancy. Articles on how what start planning for, what are the right things to eat and what aren‚Äôt. This app literally has so much information that it makes you feel really good about knowing what is happening inside of you and what to expect throughout your pregnancy! I LOVE IT. 10/10 recommend to others!"

90,90,5,2017-11-21T06:21:51.000Z,Tin2KC,Step by step Guidance As to What To Expect,"Babycenter is very informative. It provides weekly status updates of your pregnancy from conception to the third trimesters. Also, from newborn to 10 years old. I always look forward to the weekly topics for your baby/child developments. Also, it has tips/advices from other parents to help new parents i.e. what you really need for the baby during the first year, Q&A, how to take care of yourself, how to make time for you and your partner. Plus the additional tools available to track your pregnancy pictures, capture baby moments, growth, weight etc. Thus, this is by far the best baby guideline a new parent can ever ask for."
91,91,5,2018-06-12T04:53:18.000Z,EJL357,This app saved my life.,"I used this app during my first pregnancy. About 10 days from my due date I was feeling weird. But I thought I was just being a wuss and kept on going. In the checkout line at Walmart, I was waiting and browsing the app. I read about the symptoms of preeclampsia and started making the connection. I called the on call nurse who told me to go to labor and delivery and have my blood pressure checked. It was so high they padded the bedrails in case I had a siezure. They induced, and I had a healthy baby boy. It took about two weeks for my blood pressure to get back to normal, but I can't imagine what would have happened if I hadn't had the information from this app. Thank you Baby Center!"
92,92,5,2018-07-09T16:25:19.000Z,BoyMamaBear907,Great education and go to for baby!,"I love this app. When I was expecting it was great to read how my baby was growing and excellent information on the growth of my baby in the womb and all kinds of info on for me as an expecting mother. When my baby was here it flipped to a tracker for his growth! I loved that and I love to read age milestone expectations, how other moms are handling parent life through the articles and so many go tos for feeding, what to expect coming up and all of the concerns when things don't seem normal. Even the ads aren't bad at all. Well done Baby Center! I have recommended this app to so many parents - expecting first time and second and third baby and they love it. You will too."

The tools are easy to use and the navigation is intuitive. The articles are pretty helpful and the videos are fun. (One note on that, text is a little small for cellular devices, still readable but sometimes I have to pause and squint)"
94,94,5,2020-03-17T17:09:35.000Z,existential_millenial_hanna,Great so far,"I just downloaded the app yesterday. I appreciate the various features, especially the Birth Class tool! It was informative of the  choices that we can make with our care. I like the Birth Preference feature, you just check off options and it makes a pdf to give to your doctor. I also like the baby size tracker. It‚Äôs exciting to hear about my baby‚Äôs development.  I found that the baby names feature seems a little strange, there were some strange names listed and some were the opposite gender names. I haven‚Äôt gotten to explore all the features yet, but they seem useful. Overall, I think it‚Äôs a great app for being totally free! So I give it 5 stars."
95,95,5,2021-03-08T18:30:20.000Z,universeisamazing,Excellent App - must need for every new parent,"My first go to app for every stage of baby development details is undoubtedly baby center. This app gives me precise week by week development details for tracking. I can‚Äôt talk for everyone but for a first time parent like me, this app is a boon from day 1."
96,96,5,2020-06-20T08:47:23.000Z,victoria7720,Very informative and easy to use,"I tried multiple pregnancy apps in the beginning of my pregnancy (this is my first child) and this one was immediately my favorite after downloading and seeing how the app worked, I‚Äôm being induced in just 12 days and I loved learning information about my sons development by week and watching him grow! I also love the in app tools they have along with the information pages that can basically answer any questions you might have. And the tools such as kick tracking, the bump gallery and more were helpful and fun and easy to use. The app runs very smoothly, if your a soon to be mom I would HIGHLY recommend this app!!"
97,97,5,2020-01-05T06:06:18.000Z,Odque,Awesome advice and information,"As a first time mom, I think this app is very informative and helps you with almost everything from keeping track of your baby to giving you the space to ask question openly to other parents who are either new or experienced mothers as well. I also like how you can get access to so much in one place rather then looking all over the internet when you have late night curiosity or just a wondering mind and you don‚Äôt have a doctor on stand by to ask questions to. This app has helped me a lot and calmed my nerves more then once...which is a big plus since you don‚Äôt want to be stressing when pregnant."
98,98,5,2019-09-29T14:20:52.000Z,AllieB01,I love it!,"I've used this app through two pregnancies as well as post birth. It has the answers to motofmy questions before I have a chance to ask them. It gives me insight to what I should expect as normal. The app has changed a lot in the past 5 years and now offers tools for feeding, sleep, a growth tracker, as well as a sort of mile stone picture album so you have everything in one spot! I love it. If you are still pregnant I also highly recommend Growth Tracker, it's for more detailed info that hospitals will beg you to track. Also the app Full Term, is really really great for tracking contractions. These three apps keep me feeling much more comfortable about momming!"

The accuracy of the app is out of this world literally when it said we should expect to feel flutters and kicking we did, when it said my wife‚Äôs nausea and morning sickness should start to subside or dissipate it did. So since my wife is experiencing the pregnancy first hand the app helps me feel more involved and gives me great advice and ideas to ease my wife‚Äôs pregnancy... So on a a scale of 1-10 where 10 would be the highest score my wife and I give the BabyCenter app a 10! Thanks for all the great advice along this journey."

I do plan on giving it five stars if the app is accurate with how far along I am. It's been perfect so far, I love the updates and the videos along with it. So many articles that have given me a big heads up of what's to come. Awesome app I completely recommend it! / UPDATE: I have gone to the doctors to find out I am having twins! I wish I could add that to this app.. and have added information about twins. Also the app said today I am 8 weeks, come to find out I was 8 weeks about 2 days ago. But that's no biggie. The app is good but definitely should have a section for twins"

I have used it to track 2 pregnancies and am now still using it as my son is 8 months old. I actually didn‚Äôt realize that the Baby Center app keeps sending you updates and awesome articles about your baby within his or her first year! But this app is super helpful to track pregnancies and learn about them each week as your body and baby grows and also after baby is born, tracks and has helpful articles about your first year with your baby. I would recommend this app to anyone. I have used it since 2014, and have not had any major bugs or issues with this app."

The kids love seeing the video each week and I send them to my husband so they can see what‚Äôs going on inside this mysterious belly! They get to see the baby‚Äôs progress and learn neat facts about development. The videos have lifelike animations, so they feel like they get to see ‚Äúour baby‚Äù. There are also lots of other great links each day to read on lots of different topics regarding pregnancy. This way, I don‚Äôt have to commit to a book, but I‚Äôm learning a ton of great information in quick little articles. It has helped me a lot."

This is both informative and takes some of the edge off while I sit here and wait to meet my little one! Plus, there‚Äôs all sorts of tools to monitor your baby‚Äôs kicks, make a list of names, remind you of doctors appointments, make your birth plan, and more! Not to mention the social aspect you gain by joining groups of other moms in the same birth month. This app in particular also has a facet for trying to conceive, which can be so helpful for those struggling. Everything is great!"

That‚Äôs really heartless and inconsiderate and they really don‚Äôt have to worry about me using the app anymore, I will be deleting my profile while also spreading the word about what they‚Äôve done, more than once at that. People were loving my posts until the creators or whoever it is behind the scenes removed them. If the community doesn‚Äôt have a problem with what I said why do they? They just don‚Äôt want to see anyone spreading any positivity, it‚Äôs always the posts that make you scared of pregnancy and giving birth that they leave up but delete the ones trying to help make a difference in someone‚Äôs life."

One thing that I don‚Äôt like is that it asks me to log in each time I go on the app. I really wish there was an option to ‚Äúremember me‚Äù and not have to put in my login info each time I go on the app. I tried to search in the settings, but couldn‚Äôt find the option. I would really appreciate if you fixed this little inconvenience. Update: It seems like it was fixed:) now I am able to use the Face ID to log in.

107,107,2,2020-08-07T01:45:17.000Z,iphone sarahR,Update erased all my information,"I have been using this app since I found out I was pregnant with my first daughter who will be 3 in september. I have loved using all the features, tracking development during pregnancy and after birth. However, maybe I relied on it too much because I used it to store info on growth for both of my daughters and when I logged in after the most recent update, all my information was gone. I don‚Äôt have this info stored anywhere else and I‚Äôm so disappointed/heartbroken to have lost it all. I went on to log my youngest daughters size today because it is her first birthday, and the app doesn‚Äôt even show her on my account at all, like it reverted back to when I was pregnant and hadn‚Äôt named our oldest daughter yet. I‚Äôm hoping this is a bug that will be fixed and my info isn‚Äôt lost for good."

After the birth of my daughter I still have used soo much useful information from this app. I rave about it to my friends who may use other sources and I also made my mom and mother in law download it to keep up with my daughter and to just learn about pregnancy and beyond since they never had this much info at their fingertips. I am sooo grateful for this app and the hard work getting all this data and resources for us users. Love it and will never take it off my phone.

It was fun to share with my spouse too- he got a kick out of learning about fetal development and how our little baby was progressing."

It teaches the different ways of discipline, and learning. It also tells you the different things to expect as your child gets older. I‚Äôm more prepared for my child's actions before she does them. It takes the load off of wondering whats next when you can already know. The experience of being a parent is fun when you have the baby center giving you updates every month. I say download it and keep it for every kid you have especially if all their zodiac signs aren‚Äôt the same. Happy Parenting!!"

I downloaded 4 different apps to make sure I could soak in as much information as I could and after realizing I only/ always referred to this one I just deleted the others! They have everything on this app from breathing exercises, keeping track of how far along you are, days until birth, sex questions, baby size comparisons, polls (I like this feature so I can see how common my answers are to other mothers. It just makes your state feel more relatable). I seriously could stay on this app all day, there‚Äôs so much to learn. This app is truly a baby center!"

Then it started deleting my photos and showing an error message for that weeks photo and won‚Äôt allow you to click on it or anything else, just frozen. So that‚Äôs unfortunate I was relying on a fun portion of the app for my progress photos and now it‚Äôs all jumbled and missing photos. Also not very user friendly if you need to edit them or want to adjust the order of photos. Other than that the information on this app has been great and helpful. Learned my lesson to save the photos to my phone also instead of solely relying on the app."

The BabyCenter has helped me with any questions I had and answers from other parents! The baby tracker also helped me keep track on how big my baby is and what is expected of him! This app is amazing, I love it! The only downside for it is sometimes it glitches and won‚Äôt let me go back to the previous page and I would have to scroll all the way back or turn the pages.. Overall, this app is amazing and I‚Äôll continue to use it until my baby is able to talk to me properly!"
117,117,5,2020-12-31T17:29:03.000Z,Firehousemouse,Great app for tracking pregnancy and early childhood,"This app is great for tracking pregnancy, labor and delivery, as well as early childhood. The only thing I didn't like is comparing a fetal size to esoteric vegetables I couldn't relate to- wish they would use more common household items. Otherwise, the tips and suggestions were right on cue. The contraction timer was absolutely fabulous, and we used it extensively during labor. It included a ‚Äútime from last contraction‚Äù, so we could anticipate the next one. Knowing the length of contraction allowed us to anticipate the peak and resolution of each one- a godsend. Now we're expiring the early childhood component of it. So far, so good."
118,118,5,2019-09-08T14:29:29.000Z,mhargett22,I love it ü•∞,I love this app! I didn‚Äôt even know that I had any signs for preeclampsia until this app suggested that I check if I had symptoms. They listed the symptoms and I realized I had all of them! My doctors didn‚Äôt even know that and I‚Äôve been complaining for weeks! Actually it‚Äôs been about a month and a half! I am now 37 weeks pregnant and this could‚Äôve ended in disaster had I not been made aware and been able to Let my healthcare professionals know that I needed to be checked for it. Now they are about to do a Cesarion to get my daughter out so that the symptoms will go away and she will be out of the water. I think this app for that!
119,119,4,2020-10-13T20:57:51.000Z,cmhn1,Overall good app,"There are lots of great features of this app, like the group chats, the tools to find out if it is safe, the weekly videos telling you what is going on, and the articles. The only reason I did not give it full stars is because the due date calculator leaves a little to be desired. You should be able to calculate your due date using you ovulation date, or be able to enter the date of your last cycle and how long your cycle is. It would help more with accuracy. Though you can change the due date manually, it is annoying none the less. Overall would recommend this app to anyone trying to conceive, pregnant or post pregnant."
120,120,5,2017-08-16T13:09:25.000Z,mrsprab,Great app!!,I am in my 1st trimester and recently downloaded this app. The ease of use and navigation is amazing. It is as good as using the website with all the information handy and available your phone. The pregnancy and baby tools like contraction timer and birth classes seem very useful. The best feature though is the birth club which you can use to communicate with other moms.
121,121,4,2018-06-06T14:17:31.000Z,Aseeya,Great for anyone looking after a child,"This app has so much info and for a first time mom like me, it offers knowledge on topics that I didn‚Äôt even know existed. I wish I could save posts without having to send an article or link to my fb messenger. Please add this feature to the app so I can get access to those posts way faster and for easy access."
122,122,5,2018-10-08T07:03:22.000Z,JamieleeAlex,Outstanding Review,"I have nothing but nice things to say about BabyCenter. I will strongly recommend this app to my own family members and friends. It has help me as a first time mom really understand the changes that my body, and mind are going threw when they are going threw it! Amazing 3D footage of the fetus at multiple stages of the pregnancy along with the best information and advise filled every day of the week! Weekly photos called Bumpies which can be edited with available options or by you. This can be turned into a slide show later. The list only continues with everything they have to offer."
123,123,5,2019-01-13T01:44:21.000Z,odyssey561,Best baby app!!,My boss actually recommended babycenter because she used it with her second child and loved it and I‚Äôm so glad she told me about it. I love that anything you might have a question about whether it‚Äôs food you‚Äôre able to eat or skin care products you should stay away from it lets you know every single thing you can or cannot use while you‚Äôre pregnant and also it‚Äôs great that you can track the baby‚Äôs development week by week.  This is my first baby and this app definitely made me feel more comfortable about being pregnant. I‚Äôll definitely be using BabyCenter for my second pregnancy.
124,124,5,2020-12-27T14:39:53.000Z,MotherEarth33,Amazing and Informational App,"Love how they show you a related size each week of your baby‚Äôs growth and breaks down what to expect in that week for their development. Equally love the different articles and videos they give each day and related ones as you read and have questions. It‚Äôs very helpful, comforting, and you don‚Äôt feel alone or lost especially for a first time mother to be. Me and my partner love it and both have the app so we stay updated and educated together when ever we personally feel to look. Equally I love the updates they give you of your babies development after birth it‚Äôs so interesting and insightful!"
125,125,5,2021-06-26T22:13:04.000Z,Nikki Dripz,Highly surprised,"I found this app during my 8th month of pregnancy, I was looking for a contraction timer and it gave me this. When I logged into the app I found a whole world of information about baby. I plugged in due date and every week this app gives me tips of what to expect about my pregnancy and after giving birth. I get weekly reports on what to expect from my baby and suggestions too. It tells you vaccination schedule for the child, it has a component to where you form a question the baby center community and you can get feedback in real time from.  This app is amazing and I‚Äôm in love to this day."
126,126,2,2019-07-26T20:30:12.000Z,Jackamando,Mean girls club,"I was excited to find an app with such an active community because I‚Äôm a first time mom and I don‚Äôt have many girl friends. As far as general content this site provides comparable articles, measurements and info week by week. The boards are overly full so unless you have no life and can catch up on hundreds of comments on the cite posts like sharing bumpies you‚Äôll get lost in the shuffle. If you happen to ask questions be ready for 1 or 2 helpful comments, a ton of ‚Äúcall your dr‚Äù comments ( DUH, waiting for her to call back) and then tons of rude, judge mental, passive aggressive, demeaning or belittling comments. It‚Äôs not an inclusive community and  I won‚Äôt bother sharing or asking for advice anymore because I don‚Äôt need to validate my feelings of lack of knowledge when I‚Äôm trying to reach out for it."
127,127,5,2021-04-29T13:37:24.000Z,Argenfirecracker,Amazing app!,"BabyCenter is great! I can personalize my page by adding my baby‚Äôs name and due date. There‚Äôs a bunch of fun tools that help capture & record the whole process, such as baby bump photos and a contraction timer. Other cool things about the app are that it counts your weeks & gives you information on what‚Äôs happening for the week you are in for your pregnancy such as baby‚Äôs length and comparable sizes to real life things. You‚Äôll get info on your body and the changes as the weeks go by. There‚Äôs tons of helpful articles & chat circles you can talk to other pregnant women in! I‚Äôll keep this app until my beautiful baby arrives ü•∞"
128,128,3,2020-09-26T11:02:14.000Z,Breeeeeeeegame,Okay App - needs updates,"The articles are nice and helpful as well as the videos and recommendations. I also like the clear depictions of baby‚Äôs size at a certain week. The app itself just looks outdated and it only goes up to 39 weeks of pregnancy. Being 40 + 6 weeks, it feels a little discouraging. At least go to 42 weeks and have the option to say when baby arrived if past full term. The average for first time moms is 41.3 weeks so I don‚Äôt know why you wouldn‚Äôt go further than that. A lot of people believe that need to have baby at 39 weeks and don‚Äôt know that they can safely go up to 42 weeks (without medical issues). Allowing people to be more informed instead of jumping right into Newborn would be nice and more considerate."
129,129,3,2020-05-16T10:31:25.000Z,BsuchAlady,App Update?,I loved the app but I think there was an update and now not so much. The pictures in the app advertisement is what I am accustomed to and it had information laid out in a way that was very helpful and everything on the page always loaded. I deleted the app after what I thought was a miscarriage but turns out I didn‚Äôt so I downloaded the app again. The layout is different (baby dashboard information appears in a four block grid in stead of ‚Äúslideshow‚Äù) and the page never fully loads. The links to the articles don‚Äôt work when I click them and I feel like there isnt as much information available as before. Prior to all this I loved the app and found it very useful  Was there an update or do I need to update my app?
130,130,5,2018-05-13T18:32:19.000Z,MirnaB21,I Love This App üòç,"I‚Äôve been keeping up with my baby on this app and I truly do love it . They give great advice, answer most of my questions and have been accurate with mostly everything I read about the baby or babies needs. I don‚Äôt have anything negative to say about them. There app is pretty basic and not too flashy like others that make it more for one gender only. It even has videos In case reading a lot information isn‚Äôt for you . I‚Äôm currently 8 months and I started using it at 2 months after watching a Baby Center Video of a Baby developing . I would definitely recommend it to new moms."
131,131,4,2018-07-30T06:21:30.000Z,jilly1770,A few additions then perfect I think!!,"Would love to see somewhere on here how to keep track of your weight to make sure not gaining or losing too much pre pregnancy weight  to current and through term for all trimesters. Also a log or something to kept track of milestones:  Pregnancy test positive, when found out pregnant or date of 1st ultrasound. Things like that. First time pregnant and those are important to me. Possibly even a part on calendar for dr appts for baby."
132,132,5,2018-09-14T17:38:52.000Z,Lena_cruz,Pregnancy/mommy essential!!,"We have so many questions as worried pregnant woman and moms, even just the curiosity of what‚Äôs going on and why were feeling the way we‚Äôre feeling including baby. This app is full of ton of useful information! Giving you and your baby week to week updates up until he or she are born. Then what I love about it the most is that it doesn‚Äôt stop there it then turns to your baby week to week giving you each week the change in their growth and development along with baby center articles and support groups with other moms! Just download it!! You won‚Äôt regret you did."
133,133,5,2019-01-06T16:26:05.000Z,jubytwins,Great Information,I really enjoyed getting all the updates of how my children were growing inside me and how they should be growing on that month. I also enjoyed that I could text message my family the articles and have them on board with what the grandchildren looked like on that month.
134,134,3,2019-06-10T03:14:34.000Z,Africaiz,The bumpie feature changed,"Overall love the app. However after using it for years, with my now 6 year old during that pregnancy, in 2017 during pregnancy for next one and now while expecting twins, I have found the content very repetitive. In addition two features seemed to have recently change. The bumpie feature used to have a shape for you to outline yourself and make sure you have the same pose/distance when you opened your camera. This week it disappeared and now it‚Äôs a lot harder to replicate the same distance for each pose.  In addition using the app compared to two years ago, the articles are pretty much all the same and you can‚Äôt get content specific to having twins."
135,135,5,2020-09-17T04:12:31.000Z,KBFullmer,Love this app,"I loved tracking my babies development with this app. I was so excited when I found out about my little one I wanted to see right away where he was in his development. I immediately went online to find a pregnancy tracker and after downloading two previous apps, eventually settled on this one because the user interface was so intuitive, and I loved how detailed the development descriptions were. Over the course of my pregnancy I found the other features of the app to be so helpful too including: the Bumpie Photo Album, the ‚Äúis it safe‚Äù dictionary, the kick tracker, and the contraction timer."
136,136,5,2021-03-12T04:30:45.000Z,cat_lynn,Amazing app!,"For airheads like me, it‚Äôs so nice to be able to click and see how far along our little nugget is. The fruit comparisons are strange sometimes, but I guess the app has taught me a few fruits I‚Äôve never heard of too.. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
137,137,5,2021-07-14T08:54:22.000Z,AtItsHannahTime1,Best baby app!,I‚Äôve had this app since the day I found out I would be having a baby and it‚Äôs positive reminders and outlook on pregnancy has gotten me through this hard time in my life when sometimes I didn‚Äôt have anyone else! Thank you so much!
138,138,1,2019-07-11T05:10:04.000Z,anonmommabear,"If I could give 0 stars, I would","This is my first pregnancy and I had no idea what to expect. I downloaded this app for updates and information as the baby grows and develops. There are several group message boards that are categorized very specifically, but when you try utilize these boards with general questions or any issues you may or may not be having, there is SO MUCH negativity from the other women."
139,139,4,2021-01-21T21:50:16.000Z,esk341,Love the app except for the ‚Äúcount down‚Äù feature,I used this app to track all three of my pregnancies.  It works well but the developers assume all moms will to 40 weeks- which is not true.
140,140,5,2018-06-01T19:47:27.000Z,Melanie Shepherd,You‚Äôve changed my entire pregnancy,"Every week I look forward to taking a bumpie, reading the super helpful articles and getting the updates about my baby that week. Your forums have helped me with my unplanned pregnancy and making me not feel so alone. When I have a question, I look to see what other moms on Baby center have said and gone through. I feel so much more confident in what‚Äôs happening with my body and of all of the baby growth apps I have used, you have been most helpful. I seriously cannot thank you enough. Wonderful app. I have no complaints, only love for you guys."
141,141,5,2019-04-28T18:11:02.000Z,Ambieprice,Makes my day,"Baby center helps me get through the long periods of pregnancy when I just can‚Äôt wait to meet my baby and feel like it‚Äôs taking forever! The updates remind me to pause and reflect upon each little milestone. They also give accurate developmental information at all stages of life (as far as I have seen). As a person with a master‚Äôs degree in early childhood education, it is exciting to see relevant and important milestone information shared through this app for parents who may not already know the significance of each step or how to help facilitate their child‚Äôs healthy development."
142,142,5,2020-12-08T19:00:34.000Z,kyumyum,I‚Äôve been using this app for a year,I first downloaded this app when I found out I was pregnant. My baby is 5months and 3weeks now. I still love it. It‚Äôs very informative and keeps me up to date with my child‚Äôs developmental progress. I always felt like their updates were so accurate that they were writing specifically to me lol. I also like the fact that I can engage with other parents. It‚Äôs nice to know there are others out there with the same questions and concerns and even better to be able to find those answers coming from the people who learned through experience.
143,143,5,2019-12-09T04:51:36.000Z,mommask,Love this app!,"Love how interactive it is showing you what you and your baby are doing, going through, or are about to go through. Great support and information!You can even search for topics you want info on and it will give you scholarly articles to read. I thoroughly enjoy this app and love that it continues with you and your baby even after birth!! My Little one is almost a year and I love getting the weekly updates of how he‚Äôs growing/ developing! Info on nursing, health, development, play, and general baby knowledge/ troubleshooting. This app has been so much fun and a super helpful resource!! I highly recommend it!"
144,144,4,2020-11-12T21:12:57.000Z,Ms.Mcmoody,L-O-V-E,I love this app!! It‚Äôs so awesome to be able to track your baby‚Äôs weight and size with just one click and also being able to read about all the changes happening through out your pregnancy and they are pretty much spot on! It definitely helps you to not worry about preggy symptoms you maybe have not had before or for the first time and aren‚Äôt sure if it is normal or not.
145,145,5,2019-11-20T07:15:17.000Z,Jojojackio,Replaced my mom with this app!,The accuracy of everything in this app is amazing. It was the first app I got to track my baby‚Äôs development with my first baby and it was a huge help. I loved getting weekly updates of my baby‚Äôs growth! I love everything about this app. As a new mom you worry about everything! So instead of calling my mom about everything little thing I‚Äôd just look it up on my baby center app! Huge relief!!!!!!!!!!  It‚Äôs every mommy‚Äôs must have baby app! Expecting my second baby and I‚Äôve found out that I can track my toddlers progress and my new baby‚Äôs progress from the same app!!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!
146,146,5,2021-07-14T15:31:49.000Z,cap2toes,My favorite pregnancy app,"I have used this app with both of my pregnancies and I love it. I love the tools tab where I can take my bump photos and the ‚Äúis it safe‚Äù tab is great. The fact that they add you to a mommy group that is filled with moms that are due the same month as you, and can ask any question to other moms across the world and get multiple opinions if you need it, just need to rant, or talk about anything baby related and get answers from all types of moms is great! I love the growth updates and all the images it gives you to understand the week you are in. This is 100% my favorite app! (:"
147,147,5,2021-05-21T18:40:33.000Z,Nelson Family of 4,THE BEST,"This app literally helped SO MUCH!! It helped me realize I was definitely on labor with the contraction tracker with BOTH of my kids! AND has helped me with everything from breastfeeding tips, knowing that‚Äôs it‚Äôs ok that it didn‚Äôt work for me long term but short term was ok too. Helped me get my kids on a schedule (feeding and napping), helped remind me when they can start eating solids remind me to take their monthly pics (bc I know lots of tired mommas forget ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è everyday runs together lol) helped me with my picky eaters. Helped me with my PPD.  EVEN helped me put the spark back in my relationship The articles go on and on! Definitely the best download!"

I have been here for 10 years but it stops at age 8. We still need help!! Haha would like to see the advice continue through teenage years. There is no rule book for parenting but to be able to know what your experience is not ‚Äúcrazy or far out there‚Äù is SO reassuring. Again thank you for getting me through the stages!"
149,149,5,2021-01-28T02:20:24.000Z,iwnbsb,Baby number 2,I used this app 8 years ago when I was pregnant with my daughter and I loved the updates. I love how if I have any questions about my symptoms of what might be going on with me it helps me find solutions. With baby number 2 it was the same way and it has helped me so much because there is literally so much I had forgotten about what I did 8 years ago when she was a baby. It‚Äôs like a new learning experience and this app has yet again helped me find solutions and keep track of my growing baby! Will definitely use in the future again and again with my future babies.
150,150,5,2017-10-20T13:33:04.000Z,LoveMyGirlsInBoston,Every question or concern answered!,I love ‚Äòbaby center‚Äô. I use it mainly for the message boards. Even as a third time mom I still find myself with questions and concerns about my little girl. I just home on her birth message board and either get answers or someone who has gone through the same thing or similar. It has really helped me along the way and I learn so much. I love getting advice for new products before I go spend money on something that could be a fluke. I‚Äôve used baby center for three pregnancies and three babies now and will continue to use it until I don‚Äôt need to anymore!
151,151,5,2018-09-05T20:30:45.000Z,SHMiLy15,Huge help!,"After finding out I was pregnant I downloaded a bunch of baby apps to see which would help the most.  This app has exceeded my expectations!  It had articles and discussions on topics that would be helpful to me depending on how pregnant I was.  And then our LO came and it has been a big help guiding us as to what to expect, suggestions on things to do.  It's great.  Best part is it's free.  Only downside is sometimes there are helpful video tips but they won't play.  Or I'm trying to watch while breastfeeding but there aren't any captions so I can't watch it to after.  But by then I've forgotten about it."
152,152,5,2018-12-09T13:55:21.000Z,Mom of 1 princess,Great place for information,While I was pregnant with my daughter and after having her when I had a question it seemed that one of the top websites for answers was this app. There is a lot of useful information here for questions and just things that I didn‚Äôt know. It was fun using it while I was pregnant to see how the baby was growing. I encourage people to use the apps inside the app like the growth tracker and the bump gallery. It was nice to see how my daughter was measuring up once we started taking her to her wellness visits. I have recommended this app to other pregnant women I know and they have all liked it.
153,153,5,2020-08-28T16:43:16.000Z,Sowawesome,Great informative app,"This app has been updating me ever since the middle of my pregnancy. My baby is now 10 months old and I feel like every week I know a little bit better how to challenge her and I learn a little bit more about what she might be going through. It‚Äôs nice to eliminate the guessing game when it comes to why she might be fussy, or what activities I should be doing with her. I also learned a lot about different milestones, And a lot of my questions were answered about feeding and solids before I even had to ask anyone. This app is a must for anyone who‚Äôs pregnant, and raising a baby!"
154,154,5,2019-11-11T21:42:41.000Z,Keldel99,First time mom approved!,"I am a first time mom and I downloaded this app when a friend suggested it to me. It was so informational and made my pregnancy go so much smoother. It has great information that really applies to worries or concerns that you have during pregnancy. It also has great articles, tips/tricks, and advice as you go along in your pregnancy. The contraction timer is wonderful and this is the one thing that made me realize we needed to head to the hospital!!"
155,155,1,2020-06-17T23:59:50.000Z,TorieLA,Used to be the best app before updating,"I used this app three years ago with my first pregnancy and just downloaded it again for my second. Shortly after entering my data, the app was updated and has a completely different format. Everything fun has been taken away from it- all of the fun polls and informational articles that I would be so excited to read everyday. Now the app has barely any info on it, other than the size of your baby week by week, which you can only check once a week, obviously. The app crashes on me all the time now and has locked me out several times. Such a bummer. This was my favorite app the first time, now I barely check this one and I‚Äôve had to download other apps to get the same sense of excitement and info for this second baby. Please go back to the original!!"

Love the update alerts when I hit a new week. Also the community board is awesome with lots of helpful information. Only thing I wish is that it had more updates so that it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm reading the same thing from 6 years ago when I was pregnant with my son. Now on my third baby it would be nice to offer a bit more. I don‚Äôt think much has changed in the 6 years. I used it with all three of my kids in 2013, 2015, and this year. But I have to say I‚Äôve tried other apps and for a free app this one is the best in my opinion."
157,157,5,2021-05-25T20:36:39.000Z,"new mother of one, Lissa",I truly love this app,It‚Äôs been tracking the development of my baby since I conceived. It let me know what to expect during my pregnancy as it progressed and it tracked the progress of my babies growth in the womb as well. It answered questions about my daughter‚Äôs development before I even asked them. It kept up with her age and told me what I should expect as each month passed even after I already had her. She is now 7 months old and I couldn‚Äôt imagine not having this app. I wake up to a monthly development report on what to expect from my baby according to her current age. Nothing but love.
158,158,5,2021-04-13T21:47:04.000Z,VictoriaGig00,Gave me what to expect step by step!,I LOVE this app! I learned more from it than my OBGYN and this app gave me such piece of mind. I was able to find out what symptoms were normal and which ones to be concerned about (as much as possible with how different pregnancies are) as well as educating myself on the birthing process and other helpful tips given by the app!
159,159,4,2021-01-28T21:37:59.000Z,Steph-mama-28,Very educational,I‚Äôve been using this app for almost 7 years since the birth of my first baby. I‚Äôve since had a second and I still find this app helpful. The weekly emails are just right to keep me up to date on each of my kiddos‚Äô development.

I found this app and signed up, put in my projected due date, and loved all the information and tips that this app gave me. Unfortunately I had a miscarriage, so I choose the option of ""loss of child."" Since then, I cannot go back into the app. When I open the app, a prompt comes up for new child - I can either choose a due date or click trying to conceive. I click trying to conceive as I am not currently pregnant, and the app closes itself out. I tried deleting the app and redownloading it, but it does the same thing. It's annoying because I want the advice and articles, etc. on TTC and other things. Guess I'll just stick with The Bump App."

I thought the pregnancy tracker and associated advice was great, and figured it would end once our son was born.

If you‚Äôre scouting out apps, this one is user friendly and you can stop your hunt. The community and questions that other moms have made me feel part of a ‚Äúmom tribe‚Äù and included; I was not going through it alone. I asked questions and received supportive answers (specifically struggled with hemorrhoids, pelvic dysfunction, even info on a pillow cover for my preggy pillow and got fantastic recommendations, guidance and responses) The weekly updates (baby/mama) are spot on and something to look forward to."

It has so much more though! I was able to keep track of my ‚Äúbump photos‚Äù and create a sweet slideshow super easily through the app, there was a kick tracker, contraction timer and a simple brith plan maker that had you answer questions about your birth plan and make any comments that it compiles into a pdf for you! Love this app so much-it‚Äôs easy to use and multi functional. So glad I found it!"

169,169,3,2021-02-01T15:02:31.000Z,MotherOfAnAngelBabyGirl929,Infant loss awareness,I love the app. It‚Äôs perfect.. But I had lost my daughter back in September at 21 weeks and I had a hard time deleting it I just couldn‚Äôt do it. But This is the time she was supposed to be due an I wish I had the option to put on here that we lost her. Maybe put an option to set something for mother‚Äôs who have lost one & give them information on how to go on with life after losing a baby and etc.. . Instead of coming on here to see what you‚Äôre baby should be at üò¢üíî someone like me couldn‚Äôt delete the app I still want to keep an remember the memories of being pregnant with her.  But others might have a hard time. But other than that this app is great thank you.
170,170,5,2018-01-22T16:03:04.000Z,Rodgerr,Love it!!,"This app was really useful during my pregnancy. It was very easy to use and understand, the articles were helpful and informative, and I liked that it had polls that you could participate in so you knew if other moms were going through the same thing. The articles and the polls were really reassuring especially since this is my first baby and I wasn't quite sure what was normal and what I should be worried about. I also liked how it told you how the baby is growing AND how your life is changing every week. All in all I loved this app! Definitely great for first time moms!"
171,171,5,2018-10-26T11:54:11.000Z,lily2227,"Best app for Pre, during, and post pregnancy.","This app contains all the information that I need. I relied on it several times for information. It helped me to track my pregnancy, how far a long I was, what I was possibly going through, get ready for what was coming ahead. Even after pregnancy, there is a sequence to this app. What to expect for the first year appointments (what you‚Äôll be ask at the appointment, vaccines baby will be needing), what to do when baby is not feeling well and possible reasons, how to prepare your baby‚Äôs bag supplies, how to burp your baby, how to nurse, etc., etc., etc., it goes on."
172,172,5,2020-06-04T13:29:21.000Z,Shamaza,1st time mom -8 months in!,"I absolutely love reading the articles that Baby Center has available. Whenever I have a question and unable to get to my pediatrician b/c after hours, I login to my BabyCenter app and just search up what I am looking for. The video clips are brief and informative which I like especially if I am in need of a quick answer or the little one requires my immediate attention. Great job app developers and editors with the flow and appearance of the information. You have really assisted me in these several months of my baby‚Äôs life and during my pregnancy too! Thank you!"
173,173,3,2020-12-18T00:36:33.000Z,Tristen.h,App itself is Great. But not supportive AT ALL.,This app is awesome! But only for the Information about your baby weekly. I love the weekly growth scale and how it show what your body is doing. But for anyone looking for a supportive group of people to answer First time mom questions and so on I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP. Most of the people on here are Very rude and so quick to judge on questions of other people. They are very option driven and seem to only have one sided beliefs. Coming from a young first time mom I was scared to even ask anything on this app due to most the people comments on others being extremely rude and judgement driven. Not everyone one believes the same and a different variety of questions should be ok.
174,174,5,2020-02-07T05:20:39.000Z,CHINA COLBERT,"First time mom , Great app , Very Relatable","Any Questions about being a new mother or the things that I was experiencing, I was able to find answers and actually give feedback from this app from mothers just like me who either have done this before or who are in a later stage of their pregnancy who already had the answers that I‚Äôm looking for is just a big community of women who get together and encourage each other every day about their pregnancy and who support each other through everything that they go through pertaining to pregnancies and I really appreciate that."
175,175,5,2019-07-15T04:21:07.000Z,Receya brown,Obsessed,"This app is so amazing. I‚Äôm a first time mom and had no idea what I was doing or where to start. It‚Äôs very informative and sends me updates everyday. Also being able to see how my baby is growing and being able to compare it to fruit etc is cool too. It shares the do‚Äôs and do nots. Has a place where you can write down notes so you remember for your doctor. I love this app and so does my husband. My husband loves it because he learns cool tips for himself and can read along and get to know more with me. They have sections for me, for him, and if you‚Äôre having TWINS. Overall great app, plus it‚Äôs free!"
176,176,5,2020-11-04T16:39:13.000Z,kailykams,Best pregnancy app,"I have tried other apps for tracking ovulation, pregnancy and postpartum needs. This one is, by far, my fave. Love how organized it is- very easy to find the information you are looking for. They have a section where you can keep all your bump pictures and put little stickers with the fruit/vegetable for that week."
177,177,5,2020-06-22T13:03:18.000Z,Britnick999(:,Absolutely love this app,"Being a first time mom, I was extremely nervous. I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. Honestly I‚Äôm winging it half the time. Having this app through my pregnancy and continuing to use it even after my daughter was born has help me so much. When I‚Äôm unsure about something I look it up in the app. The app gives frequent updates on what babies around your child‚Äôs age does. And if we decide to have more than one child it allows you to add more kids. If you‚Äôre unsure just download it and give it a try. There are so many different features that come in handy."
178,178,5,2020-04-13T18:16:58.000Z,KentuckyAsh,4th times a charm,"Love this app, I have used it with each of my pregnancies/children and am using it now on my fourth pregnancy. It is easy to follow and keep track of the weeks going by. It even helps me remember to schedule things as I go, especially with multiple kids sometimes things fall through the cracks so a reminder is nice to have! Also reminders of what‚Äôs ok and what‚Äôs not during pregnancy is great too. I love sending screenshots of the little updates to my husband occasionally. Solid app, I wouldn‚Äôt use anything else for pregnancy tracking that is for sure."
179,179,4,2020-06-09T00:27:35.000Z,mamabear1227,Age of my kids,"I have two kiddos and am currently pregnant. When I click on my daughters name (Paris) who is one years old, it says her birthday is listed as June 8th. I‚Äôve already corrected it to June 3rd, she just turned a year old. It keeps saying June 8th at the top and is saying she is 11 months and 4 weeks. When I click on my daughter Addys profile, it displays Paris‚Äô age but the accurate birthday.. The only one that is accurate is the pregnancy profile."
180,180,5,2017-11-22T22:20:20.000Z,Motha Jess,This is for you,"This app was for me when I was pregnant with my first kid, it's for me now on my second, it'll be for me on my third as well. I get excited when I get to a new week and any question I have or anything I want to vent about to other people experiencing the same things, this app helped me get free offers and samples from different sites I never knew about, this app got me a free car seat AND breast pump through my insurance! I absolutely love baby center, the kick tracker is awesome, the contraction timer is amazing to have, and it even has a place to take selfies with you and your bump :)"
181,181,5,2018-08-01T01:33:14.000Z,medgak,Love this app!,"As a FTM I am super excited to be pregnant and having this app has made it feel a lot more real for me. I really like that everyday you see 4 or 5 articles or facts about your baby so you know exactly what's happening in every stage of your pregnancy. I also loved the Birth Club part of the app, I joined and was able to talk to lots of great people whose due date was the same month as mine. It's nice to have people that can relate to whatever you're going through and to answer all of the questions you have. Would definitely recommend this app to any expecting mom!!"
182,182,5,2021-01-20T14:04:10.000Z,Samantha 14 Bailey,BabyCenter App,"Awesome little daily updates. I wasn‚Äôt really looking forward to having a baby even after I found out I was pregnant. This app has helped me to become a little more excited, and understand what exactly is going on with the changes in my body. I‚Äôm just really hoping it‚Äôs a boy now. Either way I pray to God I have a healthy baby!"
183,183,5,2019-08-17T02:39:59.000Z,Thisismynicknamerz,Love it.,"This app has made my first pregnancy fly by so quickly and easily. I can get on and read about my pregnancy weekly, and daily! Usually whatever I‚Äôm struggling with other pregnant mothers are too! And there are options here that allow you to chat with other mothers about the SAME thing you‚Äôre going through or feeling! And what a comfort that is when I don‚Äôt exactly know what I‚Äôm expecting while expecting. What a brilliant idea for an app!"
184,184,5,2019-07-03T12:35:56.000Z,Cbrantley1234,5 stars!,"This app was so helpful during my pregnancy by giving me a play by play of what was going on with me (internally & externally) & with my growing baby. The pictures, videos, tips, & information about the entire process was beneficial to my learning as a first-time Mom & to my husband."
185,185,4,2021-05-04T16:33:32.000Z,ACG103,Great app but the newest update loses desired features,I love this app for tracking pregnancy. It is so nice to get information and to just have a tracker to see where you are in your pregnancy.
186,186,2,2021-03-05T17:15:04.000Z,Breciab4,Loved the app before the update,Great information. Love the group chats and all the valuable information. Really lets you know a lot of the things you experience are normal or odd and everyone is different but alot of the stoires and things they have for daily reads are really cool. Only thing i dont like is that there is a lot pf repetitive information.
187,187,5,2021-07-17T19:39:57.000Z,JnC. K.,Baby #3! After 8 years üòç,"I love using this babycenter app! Especially since we‚Äôre having baby number 3 after 8 years! Our first 2 are 15 months apart 9 yr old and an 8 yr old so everything with our second kid was a breeze. You forget what to do and you forget how it is after such a long time, it‚Äôs like starting all over again. I get so excited when it‚Äôs the start of a new week and I get to see how my body is changing and how baby is growing. I would definitely recommend using this for first time mothers, even if this is your 3rd kid."
188,188,5,2021-06-30T12:00:22.000Z,EVS1990,Don‚Äôt have a lot of free time so this is perfect,I don‚Äôt have a lot of free time so I live how quick and easy this is to use. Now I work in health care but OB has never been my area. So I love the quick highlights and key points. As someone who has to provide education to patients I think this app does a great job making it understandable for everyone. I also love the fact that it is pretty consistent with the information my OB office gives me. But because this app breaks down by weeks it pinpoints changes on a weekly basis versus my doctors office giving a monthly highlight.
189,189,5,2021-05-15T00:30:00.000Z,stw4228,Absolutely fantastic!,"I love Babycenter!! I‚Äôve used it with all of my pregnancies and have enjoyed watching my baby grow to the size of the veggies and fruits they compare them too! They also have tons of amazing articles on every topic imaginable regarding babies, relationships, and everything in between! My favorite part is the discussion boards where you can ask questions and get answers from real moms experiencing the same things you‚Äôre going through and being able to provide answers to other moms that are worried or just checking up!"
190,190,5,2017-10-10T17:28:51.000Z,Rachelle from Mauritius,Best pre and post pregnancy app ever!!,"Thank you to the founder and admins for your great job. When I discovered I was preggy last year, I added plenty of apps related to pregnancy and baby. Day by day I started deleting the rest and I kept only baby center and another app that helps tracks my breastfeeding/changing diaper/sleep time of my baby. When you have a baby you don't have so much time to read and fool around, baby center has short, clear articles and sometimes some videos too. Absolutely great and already recommended it to couples of my preggy friends. :-)"
191,191,5,2017-10-19T05:53:27.000Z,CocoLubb,Great educational information!,"I have loved BabyCenter's information from the very beginning. What grabbed my attention was when I saw a friend using it & I loved how it would show her comparisons of her fetus growing to fruits and vegetables. When I began my account I would love going to the grocery store to see how big my baby was getting each week. Also, I read a lot of helpful information and tips along with great educational videos. My baby is now 3 months old and I continue to appreciate & look forward to all the educational tips I can find within BabyCenter."

I am so happy that I found this app. They have a variety of everything! They even have a forum for support groups for new mums ü§ç I‚Äôm able to track my baby‚Äôs growth/progress and even name my baby with them name pool they have. I‚Äôm so full & grateful!!! It‚Äôs almost like having a little automated helper. Between this and my affirmations app, I feel so much better about my pregnancy as a first time mom. Thank you BC üôèüèæü§ç"
194,194,5,2021-07-25T04:07:01.000Z,YouTubaholic,Great app!,This app is really cool! It gives you tons of information about pregnancy and what to expect. It tells you what symptoms you could be experiencing and how your baby is growing each week. I have not thought to try another app at all. The best part is that you get put into a group of people that are due the same month as you. It‚Äôs really fun to ask questions and relate to others. If you have any worries just text all the girls. People also respond really quick with their honest opinions. I love this app and everything it supplies! I HIGHLY Recommend it!
195,195,5,2021-07-07T02:25:42.000Z,~Shawna,I‚Äôm STILL using this app!,"My daughter is currently 3yrs old (going on 31) and I STILL use this app! Granted you get ‚Äúkicked off‚Äù the app once your child turns 1, BUT, that is Not where the knowledge and articles stop. I find myself constantly referring to this app/site whenever I have a question about my little one and Good or Bad there is an article about it! You have yourself a bitter? There‚Äôs an article about that, retrograding potty training, there‚Äôs an article on that, little one getting Sassy?? THERES A FREAKING ARTICLE ON IT! Not to add it helped me so much throughout my pregnancy. Best Baby App Hands down."

It‚Äôs like this application knows what I‚Äôm thinking, sometimes before. It follows what my baby might need or is going through according to his age range. It has been very informative in basic & non-basic topics, it has also made me aware & knowledgeable of a variety of subjects to discuss with my baby‚Äôs pediatrician. I‚Äôve been already recommending to family & friends. This is GREAT!"
197,197,5,2021-07-20T21:54:47.000Z,LA-sri,Love it,"I have used this app since 2012 when I got pregnant with my first child and I love it . I love how one can connect with other moms delivering around the same time , tracking and discussing baby growth before and after they are born . I love different groups and forums one can join based on their requirements and interest . I love the updates we get from the baby center app about baby‚Äôs growth . You have chances to win prizes from time to time when there are contest, lucky draws and such interesting stuff . In short I love everything about this app."
198,198,5,2020-11-16T00:52:58.000Z,Veronica_Cervantes,"This was the best app for my pregnancy, and is the best for following my baby after birth!","The app followed my son throughout my ENTIRE pregnancy. It was awesome because it showed me how my baby, and how he was developing, what he looked like. It also gave me advice to read into about my pregnancy, birth, a birth plan, aftercare, everything. And now that my son is 9 months old; it still follows him and his development. It still gives me advice on milestones, and how to interact with him, how to help his development by playing with him in different ways, and how to introduce him to new things. I love, love, LOVE this app!!"
199,199,5,2020-08-20T09:43:55.000Z,CheersToTheCharles,The best for pregnancy and beyond,"As a FTM, this has been a huge help for me as it helps me not get overwhelmed with all the things I need to know about the changes in my body and the growth of my baby. I  love that it gives me information relevant to each week. Being entertained while learning from other moms in the birth clubs is another thing. This is the only app I use all throughout my pregnancy and I plan to keep it even after giving birth to my dear child since it has more to it than just a weekly description of what the baby looks like."
200,200,4,2018-03-29T07:15:20.000Z,Cox mommy,Love it...but...,"I have had this app my entire pregnancy this time around, and I love it...HOWEVER we are having twins and although it has a lot of articles/ideas for twin pregnancies-room ideas etc. things like where it asks what you are having and we are having one of each but that isn‚Äôt an option gets frustrating sometimes :/ I‚Äôve found this true about a lot of registries and such too, they only give you the option of choosing boy-girl-or don‚Äôt know/it‚Äôs a surprise...love the app but my suggestion would be to add where you can have more options for parents expecting multiples!!"
201,201,5,2018-05-30T04:42:08.000Z,Brookeacc,Must have for all pregnant women and moms,"This app provides informative videos and posts that are extremely timely. Throughout my pregnancy I will receive notifications a day or two before or after I‚Äôve noticed a change in my body and am wondering if it‚Äôs normal, related to the pregnancy or what‚Äôs going on."
202,202,5,2018-12-11T15:02:53.000Z,p-biddie,Useful tips and articles,I love this app for a lot of reasons. As a healthcare professional I have been trained in child development but what I like about this is how it cues you week by week with some developmental guidelines as well as play that reinforces this development. It also provides great articles from reputable resources on a variety of topics from sleep to teaching/exposing your child to the good habit of brushing their teeth. It‚Äôs a nice tool and resource that helps and without being so long winded that you get lost in the articles etc. Speaking of long winded... :) just get the app!
203,203,5,2020-02-12T12:56:56.000Z,CatieNBuddy,Great App,"I‚Äôve used this app for all four of my children and I love it! The daily info throughout pregnancy is helpful and keeps me excited about our sweet bundle on the way. I also like that the info doesn‚Äôt stop once baby is born. I get emails and updates about my children‚Äôs development and milestones that I enjoy reading. Sometimes it‚Äôs simple reminders to stop and smell the roses with your kiddos before they‚Äôre grown, sometimes it‚Äôs about psychological development, and sometimes it‚Äôs sweet activities to do with your little ones. I think it‚Äôs the best app out there."

Love this app. Have questions or want to relate to others yes your in a group of women that are due the same month as you.
205,205,4,2019-11-30T21:39:49.000Z,Tessajs1,Lots of great information,The only things I‚Äôd change are
206,206,5,2021-05-02T15:00:14.000Z,emaleigh tyler,Great !,"Okay so y‚Äôall have to get this app ! I‚Äôm only 7 weeks pregnant but I love this app so much ! It gives you information on what the baby looks like each week, what the baby looks like inside you, and it gives you symptoms it in tips how you can fix the symptoms like if you have morning sickness !So overall when I‚Äôm trying to say is I highly recommend this app for you to get if you‚Äôre going through any stage of pregnancy you just put in your due date and then boom in tracks your pregnancy and everything is just so great!"
207,207,5,2020-08-23T22:33:50.000Z,Death_xxZombie,Best pregnancy tracker!,This is the second time I‚Äôm using this app for my pregnancy and I love it so much! They give you helpful tips and also provide pictures of how your little one is growing inside. I love that it keeps track of the week and days you‚Äôre on. It also counts down how many days you have left till your due date! I‚Äôm really bad with keeping track of things on my own so this app helped so much with keeping track on my pregnancy. I highly recommend using this app. It‚Äôs also very simple to use and well organized.
208,208,1,2021-03-07T19:37:32.000Z,HCIvy99,The latest update rendered this app unusable,"I‚Äôve been a member of the website for over 15 years.  In the past, I accessed it through my web browser because that was more convenient for me.  After the ‚Äúupdate‚Äù, the site would no longer work on my browser, so I had to download this app to continue to have access.  The app is so slow and difficult to navigate, it is no longer worth it to try and use.  It drains my phone battery, so if I‚Äôm not plugged it, I can only use it for about 15-20 minutes.  It is painfully slow and many times takes you to a different link than the one you clicked on. There is no way to bookmark or save your place in threads you are reading, and it starts over from the beginning when you click out."
209,209,5,2020-07-30T14:25:38.000Z,Kukalocka,Excellent!,Great tips and info the whole pregnancy and after the baby is born. The layout is very nice and easy to navigate. I loved the kick counter and contraction tracking features. These came in so handy.
210,210,5,2017-08-07T15:04:23.000Z,Ladybptchamp,Best baby app ever,I love how it helps you track your pregnancy and have step to step different articles on the stages of each week. What you should more or less be feeling or what things will change for you and also ask for your opinion on surveys. Which is awesome because some people do feel like they are the only ones going through all these changes and they are not. Which is helpful to anyone and the best part it gives you an idea on how big your baby is growing and what is developing in the baby.
211,211,5,2018-05-11T19:18:40.000Z,Griselda Z.,The easiest and most informative app,Thoughout my whole pregnancy this app has helped me with everything! From what to expect in each week of pregnancy and as well has lists that they have created for us moms to go over for us to prepare for our baby‚Äôs arrival. Especially since we can post on a wall about any questions or news we‚Äôd like to share with other moms who can definitely help out in either supporting or helping you with any questions or anything you have in mind. 100% recommend this app for all mommies ‚ù§Ô∏è
212,212,2,2018-06-15T10:08:18.000Z,BeccaBeast,Potential to illicit fear and make us over cautious,"We have used this app each week to see how big our baby is, but that is about all I could handle. Each time I look on there, there are articles written by random people suggesting that we not take hot showers, listen to loud music, or do anything adventurous. I‚Äôve lived in fear for some of these months and gone straight to my doctors to ask about each one, which they squashed and gave us the truth about. This app is a sort of culmination of info making us over-protective and a place for everyone to share their own personal experiences and advice about everything (I won‚Äôt bother commenting on the Birth club). The intention to help moms is great, but some of this info made us paranoid."
213,213,5,2018-10-30T07:20:15.000Z,Scarlettanne,A parents quick guide to babies,This app is amazing.  It has developmental information on your baby as they grow so that you will quickly know generalizations on what and when to expect behaviors.  There is quick information sent to you on a weekly basis and daily articles sent each day.  The app is smooth and I‚Äôve experienced no glitches.  I‚Äôve used this same app for all my pregnancies/babies.  Not to mention the camaraderie you gain when you join your birth month groups...  this app is extremely useful!
214,214,4,2019-02-14T13:43:34.000Z,the one and only KIAH,Good But Can Be Annoying,This App is very informative. However DO NOT opt In on the (free/discounted) emails. 9 times out of 10 it‚Äôs just junk and just spams up your email. The deals are never that great and so far I haven‚Äôt seen any emails for free products. Still this app has some nice features like a ‚Äúkick tracker‚Äù among other cool things. You can also ask questions and usually a few other moms will help give some pretty good advice. HOWEVER there are bugs in this App as in I open my app then it randomly closes out while I use it. It also has closed out on me EVERY time I try to add a picture of my kid on the app.
215,215,5,2020-07-02T12:52:11.000Z,babymama43018,Helpful,"I loved having this throughout my pregnancy and even now after having my baby! It was so nice to be able to see how my baby was growing week by week when I was pregnant and also the tips, tricks, symptoms that are common throughout pregnancy."
216,216,5,2020-05-31T19:58:13.000Z,Tomuchnickname,Great resource for new and veteran parents,"The articles provided by baby center help new parents know and understand what to except with their baby. For old parents like me, it help me remember things that I forgot or actually never learned when I had my first child. My favorite part of the app is the community center. I am able to ask questions that I can‚Äôt ask my mom and intimate friends. Questions about intimacy with my spouse after delivery.

We read the articles instead of books and I feel like we were very well prepared, if not more had we just read books. I like how it guides you week by week."

I feel like I have a friend that understands me üòä I also appreciate all of the education I‚Äôm learning about my body and baby. I had NO IDEA most of this. I think you are just so excited to get pregnant you don‚Äôt consider the other pieces until they are happening. This app has been my first resource in learning! I would recommend this to any mama on her pregnancy journey! I even share elements with my husband as he should know too üòÅ"

From trying to conceive (TTC), to having a miscarriage (MC), and then to getting my big fat positive (BFP) again! BabyCenter has so many support groups on here and women who have been through similar situations no matter what you‚Äôre going through. I love all the new features that help me keep up with this pregnancy as well! They have a selfie or ‚ÄúBumpie‚Äù for each new week you‚Äôre pregnant that helps you keep up with your body‚Äôs growth as well as weekly updates on your baby‚Äôs growth. Thank you BabyCenter!!"

Between that, all the helpful articles and videos, and forums to either participate in or simply read, I really can't recommend this app enough.  When I miscarried earlier this year, the app even had a nice sensitive option to memorialize the child's profile, rather than delete it."

When I got pregnant with my son, this app taught me so much that I never would‚Äôve known. Being pregnant at 18 was scary, but using this app to connect with other young moms made me feel better. When I found out I was pregnant with my daughter I immediately re-downloaded this app! I‚Äôve learned all kinds of new stuff this time around and I think that speaks volumes as to how great they are about updating it. Definitely a must have for any mom!! Thanks Babycenter!!"
222,222,3,2017-12-15T18:33:48.000Z,Eglantine9,Glitchy,"The information posted on the weekly updates on baby‚Äôs growth is alright. Some of the resources and tips are useful, so that part alone would be a 4 star. Some of the information is obvious or not very interesting. The forums are really buggy and have been for at least a month. There have been updates, but it seems only more problems arise. The community on the forums needs more censoring because some women use the app to pick on others, which gives Baby Center a bad reputation. The forums and glitches are so bad that I considered giving the app a 2 star. I agree with another who said the app is not formatted well for phones."

It‚Äôs a great app. But what I find to be really annoying is that the articles are very gender specific. ‚ÄúSHE will grow like this‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let HER do that, SHE should be doing this instead.‚Äù Not all women give birth to little girls. The articles shouldn‚Äôt be gender specific. You could easily describe the child as ‚ÄúYour baby, They learn like this, they will reach this milestone...‚Äù it can make the articles more relatable. I have nothing against baby girls and I‚Äôm not being sexist but it does get kind of irritating that whoever writes the articles, doesn‚Äôt even consider having little boys in mind. Or how about this. Don‚Äôt be gender specific at all. Make the articles relatable to parents in general. Parents of little girls AND little boys."

As a single mom, I felt lost at times and that I wasn‚Äôt fit, but BabyCenter was able to help give me facts, information, articles, videos, and so much other resources that I was confident enough to feel and know that the tactics would work. Of course each baby varies, but most of them worked! I highly recommend to any new parent or even seasoned parents to download the app for guidance and new ways to care for your child!"

The ability to connect with moms from all over the world is also a great plus to the app if someone is questioning anything other moms can chime in to offer help. The entire app is a great resource that isn‚Äôt too pushy and it has helped me for the last 5 years with tracking my oldest, to now tracking my 2020 baby!"

Especially in the early days when it was too early to tell friends and family, I had a community to rely on who would celebrate the small but significant milestones with me. Especially during COVID, this app has allowed me access to making friends and bonding with other moms that I would not have safely been able to do otherwise. Download it. You won‚Äôt regret it."

I absolutely appreciate Baby Center for having so much information for us new moms, old moms and soon to be moms!

The recent update with font changes and then the Babycenter staff and programmers sticking with this horrible font is sad because I read how people can‚Äôt function while reading because it causes eye strain, migraines and other issues with people with disabilities. I myself don‚Äôt have problems immediately but I can‚Äôt spend as much time as I used to because the words start floating all over the page. People as mass leaving their groups, Group owners can‚Äôt monitor their groups because of the above problems and no one is making any strides in making changes to a different font.

It‚Äôs full of know-it-all women that have had kids and feel like they‚Äôre the authority on all things mother... with kind and helpful souls peppered in between. It‚Äôs mostly a sounding board for bored petty stay at home mothers that have nothing else better to do (though they could be somewhere offline seeing about their child) and would rather troll boards looking for new moms to harass. It‚Äôs an awful, unregulated by Baby Center Community board leaders and is a chicken coop at bestüôÑ. Save your time.

Being pregnant with one child was already an emotional thought but with TWO?! I felt overwhelmed & a tad bit fearful. I found this app which relieved me of every concern I could possibly think of as a new mother. Every article I came across was extremely informative & put my nerves to ease. It helped me throughout my entire pregnancy & even now that my babies are two months old. Definitely recommend for any new moms to be & even those who already have children!

Has online forums to talk to other mums about your issues for advice and different tools such as a kick counter and a contraction timer as well.

233,233,3,2019-03-02T22:57:58.000Z,kaysday,Great but the forums are catty!,I loved this app its so informative my advice would be if you download use it for the wonderful information and don‚Äôt bother with the forums! I‚Äôve seen new moms get attacked for asking ‚Äúdumb‚Äù questions I stuck up for one poster and got attacked lol on top of them taking advantage of how you report people misusing the app so i was reprimanded for it while for a month straight this woman was repeatedly bullied there‚Äôs definitely a mean girl forum going on and people seeking comfort shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with that! And I‚Äôd say to whomever monitors these posts do a better job at cracking down on rude people instead of singling out the people that tried to help I‚Äôm disgusted!

I use it for me, but you can use it to find a community of people with your close due date, etc.  This app helps me find deals on baby items and tells me what to expect, plus more!

From the moment I became pregnant ( each time) to this date I get updates and milestone reminders for each of them.

I deleted the app and reinstalled it to see if that would work, but it didn‚Äôt. Not only it didn‚Äôt help, it deleted all my bumpie pictures and kick tracker recordings. Which I didn‚Äôt think would happen since I have a profile and I thought it would save onto my profile. It needs a little work but regardless I‚Äôd recommend this app to someone else."

It‚Äôs made it a lot easier to be able to know we are on track. With being a first time mom it‚Äôs hard sometimes to know whether my baby is getting enough food or how much she needs or if she‚Äôs getting enough sleep. Baby center has made this journey easier by providing a database with a ton of easily accessible info to make this transition into parenthood soooo much easier.

Being that this is the Baby Center, you would think that they would make it a support area and where you would WANT to join.....nope. The community board is full of immature rude women who have nothing better to do than kick emotionally stable women while they‚Äôre down. Sad part too is that is seems to be the same group of women. The Group owner‚Äôs do nothing about it, and women who are seeking advice end up just getting their post filled with unnecessary rudeness.

A lot of the videos are outdated with some old fashion information. I noticed a lot of the text focuses on negative information and ‚Äúwhat can go wrong‚Äù installing fear.. not really my style. It was also very irritating that although you have the option to chose boy or girl the text doesn‚Äôt change. A lot of the text says ‚Äúshe‚Äù and well... I‚Äôm having a boy.

I love the fact that it gives you not only week by week updates but there are also day by day articles and developmental information. They even send you emails related to your older children up until age 10. Amazing app and I would absolutely recommend it to any parent."
265,265,5,2020-09-15T21:49:56.000Z,girlkanye,New mom,I check the app literally everyday. Just to read the group posts and questions. It's not only for the women carrying but for the men as well. My boyfriend was curious of the size and things developing so he downloaded the app as well and absolutely loves it. I highly recommend using it if it's your first time becoming a mom. A lot of the other women have the same questions I was wondering and put me at ease. It's a huge community full of understanding and loving mothers. I don't regret it at all. I recommend it to any upcoming parents.

267,267,5,2019-07-08T00:57:56.000Z,KarmenLopezDeLaCruz,Baby Center Great for Multiples?,I absolutely love this app. It‚Äôs so easy to use and has a lot of information. I especially appreciate how it helps guide the parents through what to expect and what steps to do. I have used it with my previous two pregnancies.
268,268,5,2021-05-11T21:23:00.000Z,JJyotsna,Very detailed,Everything is very detailed in this app so it‚Äôs way too helpful for new parents  who are just stepping into parenthood as well as the ones who already have experienced of having one baby long ago n now they have to start again like me I have one daughter who s 8 year old n the other one is 6 months old so I almost forgot everything but with this app I m again coming back on track .. one more thing is that you can learn from other parents experiences too
269,269,5,2021-04-04T05:00:28.000Z,Haylz_ts,Great Baby Guide,"This is an amazing app. As a first time mom who basically had to do everything on my own, this app has helped guide me through my pregnancy and first year of motherhood. On top of that there are so many sources of information available and forums for moms and moms-to-be to engage in and form support groups. It has answered a lot of my questions and helped me keep track of the different stages of pregnancy as well as baby milestones and what to look out or forward to. Highly recommended for both moms, dads and expectancts."
270,270,5,2018-06-05T23:32:05.000Z,Really Hurt,Answers my questions before I ask,"I was sitting in the dentists office today and I started thinking about when I might need to start taking my 7 month old to the dentist. Sure enough, within hours I get my weekly email and one of the topics is dental care for your babe. This happens all the time! If someone else asks about the development of their own child, I just have to search a topic and I land on exactly the info I need. Very comprehensive articles about everything I think about. Can't be beat!!"
271,271,5,2018-06-08T18:32:39.000Z,BlessedMom2017,2nd timing to use the site.,I loved having the baby tracker and using this site during my pregnancy and still up to now. I have a 8year old and a almost 1 year old and I absolutely love the information it has gave me and helped me at times of stuff I kinda forgot as time has passed or needed to check on to refresh my memory. I strongly advise any parent or new parents to use!
272,272,3,2018-06-12T07:07:09.000Z,Hloktty130,What was the purpose of the update?,"Although this app was good to use when I was pregnant, I unfortunately ended up having a miscarriage. Shortly after, this app had an update that was supposed to allow you to have access to the app if you were trying to conceive. I immediately went ahead with the update because my fianc√© and I were still hopeful to try again for a baby. Lo and behold, despite the update, you are unable to use this app if you‚Äôre not actually pregnant. Therefore, I‚Äôm forced to wait to use this app until I become pregnant again. At this point, I‚Äôm still unsure as to what the ‚Äúupdate‚Äù was even for."
273,273,5,2018-10-06T12:29:01.000Z,kat Nguyen0914,I love it,I been having this app since I was 20 years old. It help me on a lot of things and my concern of being a new mom is awesome I really recommend this app for first time Mom‚Äôs especially if you have no idea and or you don‚Äôt have the support system of helping you what to do with a baby this is the app. I totally recommend this for everybody and also the ones that‚Äôs actually trying to have a baby it will give you great information if there way a I could rate this a 10 i definitely will
274,274,5,2021-01-16T19:28:41.000Z,shellyfrank2.0,This App Does it ALL!!!,"This app is amazing. Not only does it provide important information and  articles, but they break it down step by step with pictures to accompany the text. In addition, it has registry information, baby name suggestions and a variety of supportive community group chats that covers any woman at any stage during her pregnancy journey. Whether you‚Äôre trying to conceive, had a miscarriage, have questions about ovulation, your body, products related to pregnancy, currently pregnant or had a baby, this IS THE APP FOR YOU!!!"
275,275,5,2020-11-29T04:36:00.000Z,Mardin A.,First time mom-approved and recommended app,"I am learning day by day about my babies‚Äô growth and development. All of the articles I have read  and the video clips I have watched (on repeat!) are very helpful to me as a soon-to-be first time mom of multiples. I especially love the food, medication and symptom lookup. It makes pregnancy less scary when you are knowledgeable of the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts. And it makes preparing for your baby/babies easier with all the tips and hacks from other moms and/or parents. I highly recommend this app."
276,276,5,2019-11-29T16:42:12.000Z,Babygirlsandra1984,Love it!,This app is so easy to use and allows you to look ahead to prepare for what‚Äôs coming or look back if you found out a little late in the game that you were pregnant. I also enjoy that you can change your due date if needed and you can see how far along you are to the date. I think this app is awesome for dads to be as well because it has so much information for them to understand the process so that they don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúleft out‚Äù. They like to be included as well.
277,277,5,2019-10-17T17:09:49.000Z,Trudie03,Helped make the journey enjoyable,"At 31 weeks pregnant I have had times that I worried throughout my journey, such as when I didn‚Äôt feel baby move a whole lot, or having random nauseous days, but this app always seemed to have articles or a person that had a similar experience. Which brought me tons of relief."
278,278,5,2021-05-27T13:04:28.000Z,kat starry,Love this app // Trigger Warning,"I used this app through 5 out of 6 of my pregnancies. It was very easy to end the weekly notifications when I miscarried, which was different from the first app I used where I couldn‚Äôt make the notifications stop. I love the updates, all the content, and the wide variety of supportive features. I have two boys, my youngest is 7 months and 2 weeks and I‚Äôm LOVING the weekly updates. They provide insight into my baby‚Äôs behaviors and tips to help make life easier. Thanks BabyCenter!!"
279,279,5,2021-02-02T15:48:48.000Z,MrsClark/RowansMom,My favorite app,"I‚Äôve used this app since I was two months pregnant and I absolutely love it! I thought it was just a pregnancy tracking app, but after the birth of your child, it shows you milestones for him/her, and it also gives you a LOT of great information about different things your child might be going through every week! I use it at least once a week, and I‚Äôm pretty sure it has helped shaped my mothering skills. It gives you recommendations on literally everything!"
280,280,5,2017-08-13T14:26:32.000Z,Lexi_law,The Best Baby App!!!,I am a first time mother and I used this app on a daily basis when I was pregnant. It really does have all the information that you need to know. I rarely have to google anything because this app has all the answers. I also love the fact that it is still very useful even after the baby is born. My son is now 7 months and I still get updates and information for babies at this stage. I rarely write reviews but this app has been so useful to me that I felt compelled to share.
281,281,5,2017-10-14T02:39:02.000Z,The Notorious B.O.B.,My best friend and every hour,"Through sleepless nights, endless questions and New dad panic, this app and website have been INVALUABLE.  Years of overthinking could never compare to the wealth of information, ease of access and variety of insight provided. I could say more, but my baby doesn‚Äôt sleep through the night yet and so that means I don‚Äôt either. Wow, thank you BabyCenter. You‚Äôve been a true friend for the past 15 months and I will always sing your praises."
282,282,5,2018-02-19T15:06:07.000Z,chloee J,Appreciative for this app,Going through my pregnancy i May have been a bit dramatic and there were a lot of questions i had about several different things. The groups were supportive and it was very good to know that other women had some of the same issues i had. Most of the time i was emotionally out of it i would turn to this app for support. Outside of support groups i love the fact that i would be updated on the progress that my baby would be making born and unborn.
283,283,1,2018-02-26T14:17:30.000Z,Carriem617,Continues to send notifications after miscarriage!!,"I don‚Äôt typically rate apps, but I had to this time. We downloaded the app after learning we were pregnant. We loved Baby Center for our previous pregnancies. However, we suffered a miscarriage several weeks ago. I updated my information on the app and in my Baby Center profile. However, the app continues to notify me each week of my baby‚Äôs progress. I can‚Äôt get it to stop. When I open the app to try any remove the pregnancy, it says I don‚Äôt have a currently pregnancy listed."
284,284,5,2018-05-30T18:48:18.000Z,mars_loves,As a new mum! Love it!,Great app! Love the weekly notification of baby growth while in my tummy also like how I was able to take photos and add caption/signs to the photo. I also enjoy the weekly to monthly growth milestone notifications. I love the search function if I have a question it lets me know that they is other parents that are going through the same thing and provide the feedback of the situation. Another thing that I like was that there isn‚Äôt many adds bombarding my time w the app. I am a super satisfied.
285,285,5,2018-06-08T18:51:00.000Z,Baylei T,Awesome for week by week,"This app is absolutely awesome!! I have NO negative comments about it!! The entire time I was pregnant I had this app and it was sooo cute to be able to see each week how big she had gotten with the fruit comparisons! It was so comforting feeling having videos and hearing other moms suggestions and having so much to offer on this app! I love it, and the after pregnancy features with all the baby stuff is even better! I have no negative thoughts about this app, Babycenter does an amazing job ‚ù§Ô∏è"
286,286,5,2018-07-27T22:48:56.000Z,clo647254,BabyCenter has the answers!!!,"First of all I love how the app sends you notifications about when you enter each new week of pregnancy! It‚Äôs always fun to find out what food my baby sizes up to each week. One thing I really love is that every time I have a weird question or need to learn about something, there‚Äôs an article on BabyCenter or someone else asking the same question. So I don‚Äôt have to feel confused or alone! I‚Äôve learned so much that I can feel more educated about my pregnancy and my baby."

Oh and it keeps track on how many weeks my baby and the day I should give birth so that really good but I love this app and keep up the great work !!!!!"
288,288,5,2019-01-18T21:38:27.000Z,TJ-Mimi,Great for Grandmas and Dads,"Baby Center is something I didn‚Äôt have as a mother-to-be 35 years ago.  As a now grandmother-to-be (after 15 years since my granddaughter), I feel bonded to my new one to come.  The images and videos help me a lot!  I read and look at every update emailed me to learn what the baby is doing from week to week.  It‚Äôs amazing and exciting.  My son-in-law can follow his baby along too.  How can you not fall in love with your tiny being knowing his/her life inside the womb? Glad to discover Baby Center (thanks!)."
289,289,5,2021-06-26T20:08:02.000Z,Coulter928,I absolutely love this app,"I love this app so much. It makes me feel connected to my baby by learning about the changes she goes through in the womb. The app is so spot on when it comes to symptoms us mommies should be feeling during a certain time in the pregnancy. I check every single week at the growth of my baby, the changes that happen to both me and baby. And also read the articles provided. Because they are so informational. I love this app. I would recommend it to any mama ‚ù§Ô∏è"
290,290,5,2018-06-08T15:43:08.000Z,mommieKC,Lifesaver for Me,This is a lifesaver for me as a new mom. I love the updates & how easy it is to find info. I got other apps as a new Mom but this is the only 1 that I‚Äôve continued to use. I‚Äôve never been 1 to join chat boards or groups but I absolutely LOVE that I joined the BabyCenter group. As a new Mom it feels so good to know you‚Äôre not the only 1 experiencing whatever you‚Äôre going through at that moment. I‚Äôm ALWAYS able to find info on any question I have & am always able to find realistic solutions quickly.
291,291,5,2019-03-23T20:10:52.000Z,MommyMolina,HappyMommy,"I love using the app because it gives me all the information I have not been able to receive from most people around. Where some information lacks in detail through open resources and close relations, baby center has provided close to details, reliable resources, and enlightening videos that help the idea of pregnancy seem like a breeze! I enjoy the baby tracker and am astonished by the tools it provides. Thank you to those who‚Äôve created such an amazing idea to life!"
292,292,5,2020-12-08T12:07:49.000Z,bee.isbeautiful,It‚Äôs good for current and expecting mothers,"The app gives great advice and updates for when you are pregnant. I used it mostly when I was pregnant. It explains what‚Äôs happening weekly with your baby in womb. It also gives updates after baby is born that I read also. I get advice for my 9 year old on the app well. The app has a contraction timer, you can edit and save pregnancy pics, discussion pages with other moms for questions, opinions and advice and they have much more ü•∞ I love this app."
293,293,5,2020-10-07T16:43:41.000Z,QTlove100,Forever grateful!,"Beneficial app! I am a first-time mother, so everything was so new to me. My mom did her best to give me tips here and there, but sometimes people forget the process when it was such a long time ago for them. I also was adopted, so some of the bodily functions and emotions associated with the body changing my mom never went through before. This app is like having a mother, a close sister, a grandmother, all in one. It held my hand through everything and still is!!:-) I am so grateful for this app!"
294,294,5,2020-03-26T19:12:34.000Z,lovemyquirp,Totally recommend this app!,"Way better than any other baby app and is very very accurate. Shows you day to day of how you and your baby are growing. Also if you have questions you can type it in the search bar and get all kinds of answers. There is also a kick counter and all kinds of tools for before and after baby. There is even videos every other day of how you and baby are growing, or you can watch birthing videos and etc. I really love this app!"
295,295,4,2020-07-28T21:52:15.000Z,mouauser,App works well and provide advised tips,Good app overall. Useful content it seems (been using it for a month). Areas to improve:
296,296,5,2019-12-06T14:10:44.000Z,APP OPS,Great for New Parents,"As a new parent and new to the fatherhood. I didn‚Äôt really know what to expect when having a baby. But this app did a great job, when it comes to preparing and taking good measures for the welcoming of the baby. And also things to do for my wife to make her feel comfortable during her pregnancy."
297,297,5,2021-07-23T17:14:23.000Z,ItsAhji,First Time Mom,I love this app. I‚Äôm a first time mom and I was so confused. My friend Lex referred the app to me since she used it with her two kids and raved about how great it is. Thankfully I have had a wonderful experience and have been learning things I never knew before. It‚Äôs helpful to have the kicker app for getting closer to the due date and the bumpies help me feel and see the difference in my body over the months I‚Äôve been pregnant.
298,298,5,2021-05-25T13:19:46.000Z,Xxvrban,Love this app!,"I was a little skeptical about getting this app but I love it. As the weeks go on, I send me information to the hubby and he feels so included. We both get so excited when we realize that our baby is making progression. I think my favorite thing about this app is comparing the size of the baby to fruit. It‚Äôs so exciting! Oh and another thing is that the articles they include make you feel like you aren‚Äôt alone in this. All in all, it‚Äôs a wonderful app. 5 out of 5 stars!"
299,299,5,2021-03-22T14:02:59.000Z,Stinky juggling,Extremely informative,"I love being able to read about how my baby is growing weekly, looking weekly, how he or she is forming, what helps with the symptoms I‚Äôm having  and everything else that it offers! I get so freaking excited every week to tell my other two boys when they ask, ‚ÄúHey Mom, which fruit or vegetable is the baby this week??‚Äù Im very grateful for this app & the creators of it. They are saving the wondering minds of mothers and keeping them content with knowledge they are gaining daily with this app. ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞"

The app itself is easy to use for the most part. For some reason the community pages don‚Äôt load all the way or the screen goes blank when I‚Äôm reading or responding to a post. I loved this app and the support from the community with my first pregnancy, which is why I returned when I got pregnant again. I‚Äôm already tired of dealing with the freezing and having to reset the app only to have the same things happen again within minutes."
301,301,5,2018-05-26T16:03:27.000Z,kyliemcglynn42,Best Pregnancy And Now New Mom App,"I have used this app since the start of my pregnancy as a first time mom and honestly I probably wouldn‚Äôt of been half as ready without it. Not only is it informative, organized, and all around a great place to go with any questions - the community part is great too! I cannot believe that it continues even after your baby is here giving tips for new moms during those first weeks. I am so grateful this app and website exist and I would recommend it to anyone."
302,302,5,2019-01-16T19:51:00.000Z,MamaU1126,My favorite pregnancy app and beyond!!,"I loved this app when I was pregnant and being able to read all the different details of what is going on and what to expect. A major plus is the blog area which connects u to tons of mommas who can give advise or just vent. Then, not realizing after I had my baby, it sends me an alert and now is following my child every week with updates and facts. It is simply the best. Don‚Äôt even bother buying the book what to expect when expecting. It is all here."
303,303,3,2019-04-13T08:07:15.000Z,NiceBoo002,Helpful but glitchy,Overall I love the app and find the information provided to be very helpful. From the videos to informational links and more I have found this app to be quite useful. Being a first time mom I have taken heed of the text provided and often go back to look at those topics when providing information to others. However I do get frustrated when the app just logs me out on it‚Äôs on for some odd reason. It‚Äôs a hassle to have to re-enter all of my information every time. That alone makes you want to delete the app and not bother with it. Please fix this issue someone.
304,304,5,2020-12-27T14:08:01.000Z,99123799,Best baby app ever,When my sister was pregnant I wanted to track her but I couldn‚Äôt find an app that can do it well but then when I was looking on my phone an ad popped up babycenter it did everything it tracks your baby it shows what sizes they are every week and it shows the baby in your stomach and which parts of there body are forming they also sell things there for your you and your baby like breast pumps so if your looking for an tracking baby app this is the one

307,307,5,2021-07-11T23:16:14.000Z,krb1376,Great app,Used this app for both of my pregnancies. I love following it week by week and I love that you can track your belly as it gets bigger and add pics/filters . It was fun to switch back to my older son when I was pregnant with my second to see the differences too because everything saves for each child and you can just click back-and-forth. I also really enjoy the weekly milestone updates and that my three-year-old still gets them as well.
308,308,4,2021-07-23T18:34:24.000Z,Zia2018,Baby Center,"I adore this app and have used it with both pregnancies. It gives me tips and reminders as I fly through my pregnancy which I love. It also has different forums for all types of mothers across the world who you can share your experiences and vice verse with. Baby Center is a wonderful app especially for first time mothers. I would recommend to anyone. Lastly I do also love how even though my first child is going on 3 now, Baby Center doesn‚Äôt hesitate to still keep me up to date on his progressive steps as well and what I can look out for."

You can even talk to real people online who can help with a situation you maybe dealing with but you can not get an answer to the question out of your doctor or provider at that time and it may just be the solution you need.  Thanks baby Center for making this all possible! I have been a member for over 9 yrs!"
310,310,5,2018-05-23T14:41:15.000Z,Nissah üíï,Loveee,I‚Äôve been using this app since I got pregnant with my first child in 2015 and I now use it again with my second. Not only does it inform you all throughout your pregnancy but it also gives you tips and advice on your growing child at each stage of life ! I now get weekly updates on my 2 1/2 year old as well as my unborn! I love the information and advice from been there done that moms and the questions from first time moms. Great app ! Highly recommend it to all mommy‚Äôs and daddy‚Äôs to be !
311,311,5,2018-12-04T17:53:56.000Z,b@by_2,Great information,I really enjoy this site and the information is great. I work with toddlers and infants and the information here is spot on. This is my second pregnancy and both times I used the app. Love the videos on the fetus‚Äôs development and then the child‚Äôs development after birth. It would be great if there was an option to add another email ( like my husband‚Äôs) address of someone who wanted to receive the same alerts of how the fetus is developing without them having to sign up.
312,312,5,2019-01-17T02:02:14.000Z,LadySmiley11,Amazing,This app is the absolute best. I have had since I found out I was pregnant until now and my baby girl is 6 weeks old. It helped so much as far as giving you information that you may need to helping you to stay informed on things that you may not have even thought about. It also gives you a forum to share your thoughts and concerns with others and get their feedback as well. This is the best app I have ever used and would recommend it to anyone!
313,313,5,2019-11-04T22:55:22.000Z,trjnk77,So much better than What to Expect!,IM 21 weeks and have been using the What to Expect When You‚Äôre Expecting‚Äù app. What a waste of time. This app is so much better! The tracking tools for contractions and kicking are great and all of the information about what is and isn‚Äôt safe from types of exercise to household cleaners and sleeping positions is invaluable. WtEWYE is so cheesy and annoying to listen to whereas this app is real and just gives you the information you need. I‚Äôm so relieved to have found this app!
314,314,4,2020-07-15T04:47:40.000Z,DD-424<3,Pretty good overall,"It‚Äôs really a great app to help keep track of your pregnancy and gives tons of info. I wish it was kept closer to scientific evidence based info, as some is a little out there, but even that isn‚Äôt too bad. I also wish it had more information pertaining to additional pregnancies. Many non-FTMs know the basic ins and outs of pregnancy that the app mostly provides, but not always info on what to expect the second or third time around when your body has been through it before. (IE you‚Äôll start showing sooner)"
315,315,5,2019-07-21T13:16:43.000Z,Aerie from the bay,2 babies now,I have had two daughters now and I love this app! It‚Äôs still sending me things about my 4 year old and what to expect! It‚Äôs helped remind me of some of the things I forgot after my oldest daughter Carmen was born and made sure Skylar didn‚Äôt miss out on all the baby activities. Any mom knows when you have multiple the younger ones don‚Äôt get as much attention as the oldest because now your chasing two people! Lol I love love love this app and if I ever have any more we will be using this app!
316,316,5,2021-04-16T23:33:27.000Z,Nae 01,JanaeB1960,Literally the best app I could‚Äôve asked for during this pregnancy!! Any question I have it had an answer. All my concerns I look it up on the app it‚Äôs there ! It was completely accurate every week of my pregnancy when it came to her growth and my symptoms. This app kept me on track and has been my go to for baby tips and tricks. Even the tools they provide like the contraction calculator and sleep guide have been amazing for me. Thank you baby center. For a free app this is truly amazing !!
317,317,5,2021-03-05T20:32:23.000Z,S4kimbal,I come here for all my questions - love it!,"I love this app! I have used this app during both pregnancies and there‚Äôs so much information available at your fingertips in one spot, it makes it so quick and convenient to find answers to any questions I have. There is such a wide variety of topics covered and you can read about experiences other moms have had in addition to real facts and research done on a topic and figure out what fits your family best. I highly recommend it."
318,318,5,2020-11-09T01:46:05.000Z,QueenMc318,First time,First time being pregnant so I have no idea what I am doing or what I should be doing...or not doing and this app has been a life saver!!! Gives u articles to read each week and suggestions. My favorite part is the community! They pair you with groups of women going through a he same thing as you and you can talk to them and feel all the love and support you and your baby need! It don‚Äôt matter if its your first pregnancy or the 5th one this app is for every parent!!!
319,319,3,2019-10-16T12:34:03.000Z,iGooch76,Informative but can be so much better.,"With all the options to choose from, this app is good but there are a few things I wish were tweaked. I would like to search in the Birth Club for specifics in real time. The boards just seem hard to get to or navigate. Scrolling is the only way to find what you think you‚Äôre looking for. The slideshow bumpie feature keeps crashing the app."
320,320,5,2018-09-18T16:56:00.000Z,Victoria c:,My opinion...,"This app was recommended to me from a friend that had three babies and she personally liked it. This is my first child so I want to experience as much as I can with pregnancy apps. When I logged in the app knew my exact week/day I was pregnant. Then the weeks you are there are different stories, articles, and polls. It also tells and shows you what the size of the baby is. It‚Äôs cute and I really enjoy it. Thank you for making this app. I 100% recommend it!"
321,321,5,2019-01-14T17:56:32.000Z,BeTheLove7,Love it!!!!,"It‚Äôs my first pregnancy and I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. This app has helped me understand what‚Äôs going on inside my body and what to expect looking ahead and even gives tips and ideas of how to prepare! There is a community of parents who speak of their personal experience, and even tools to help you keep track of milestones like baby bumps along with baby names that you like! This app has provided such a fun cool way to keep track of my weekly growth. Thank you for the support!!!!! üíñü•∞ü§óüíï"
322,322,5,2021-07-16T12:56:12.000Z,Cisanga,Best Pregnancy and Baby App,"I got this App as a secondary App to track my pregnancy. I quickly found that although it‚Äôs a free App, it‚Äôs very informative and I‚Äôve learnt so much. I was especially happy to see that I could transition to monitoring and learning about my baby and what to expect as a first time mom! So many of my questions about different aspects of baby health and good habits have been answered here (More technical stuff always consult your Pediatrician). I‚Äôm so grateful for this App and give it all 5 stars happily!"
323,323,5,2020-11-18T20:36:21.000Z,R&A&F,Amazing App!,"I‚Äôve used this app with my first pregnancy and it has been so helpful! It‚Äôs so informative on what to expect and things to do. I had questions for my doctor sometimes and later I noticed on the app it had the answer to my question, I just didn‚Äôt think to look! After that I definitely got on it more! I recommend to all new mom‚Äôs and even if you‚Äôve already had a baby it‚Äôs fun to learn new things you might‚Äôve not known previously. Give it a try!"
324,324,4,2021-03-16T13:01:22.000Z,Courtsnumber1,Love the Info & Tracking But....,"I've unfortunately miscarried and I'm not seeing a way to stop the countdown of ""my pregnancy"". I'm sure you can understand how annoying this would be, but since this is such an unfortunate but normal occurrence...you would think there would be an easy option or selection to stop the countdown. But nope - it's in my face how far along I would have been :-/"
325,325,5,2020-11-09T17:25:19.000Z,belle_femme.xo,Great App and Awesome Community,"This app is amazing. I downloaded it on a recommendation of someone else while I was pregnant. I loved all the facts it gave me and made me feel closer to my unborn. After I delivered, once you update it to reflect delivery, the information changes to all the developmental milestones of the newborn. The birth club community is awesome! So many questions answered and feeling connected to other mothers that delivered in the same month as me! I love this app and have basically deleted all the other apps I had."
326,326,5,2020-11-08T15:43:19.000Z,TravisCarolina,Great!,Love using this app! I‚Äôve used for over 7 years to track my pregnancies and to relate to moms all over the world who are going through everything that you are. Though 7 years ago it was just a website forum but was always a great resource and never let me down! Which is great especially when you‚Äôre high risk every time it definitely helps knowing there‚Äôs a support system of other moms going through it too that are there for you if needed.
327,327,5,2020-11-05T15:11:35.000Z,Faith Meck,Review,"BabyCenter is a great app! it helped me track my ovulation, then after i conceived it did a wonderful job with weekly updates about how big my baby is getting and how my body is growing. After i gave birth it gave me weekly updates about my baby‚Äôs development; My favorite part about this app is the birth club discussions!! there are so many topics and it‚Äôs great to express any concerns about you, your baby, your body, etc. and it‚Äôs very helpful because everyone has a different opinion."
328,328,5,2020-10-30T20:52:05.000Z,tiedtheknot,Enjoyed the app!,"I am a mother of 4 and I used the app with my last 3 children pregnancies. Enjoyed the app. Good information. I was able to use the app with my youngest 2 at the same time. They are 2 years a part. So while I was pregnant, I received pregnancy info and I received info for my son. Did not join birth club so I have no info about it. Just really enjoyed how the app kept me updated during my pregnancies with how many weeks I was and info about me, the baby, and other pregnancy info."
329,329,5,2019-09-17T16:44:23.000Z,Nikki10121,Helpful for curious moms ü§ó,"I‚Äôve used this app with multiple pregnancies now, and like it a lot! The format is very user-friendly, and the articles seem to always be popping up just when a new mom may have questions about that particular topic! It‚Äôs so fun to check in and see how the baby (and momma) should be feeling/looking from week to week. The only annoying part of the app is the incessant cord blood banking ads/articles/polls - especially towards the end of pregnancy."
330,330,5,2017-08-08T18:39:59.000Z,L.Shokias,Best pregnancy app,"This is my first child and this app has guided me all the way from the start, it gives you important information as to what to expect each step of the way from the way your body is changing to what you should and could eat to how big your baby is growing from week to week.  I also love how you can take part of poll questions as to how your experience is going and see how other women are doing as well it feels like you aren't alone."
331,331,3,2018-08-04T20:08:12.000Z,Aubsmcbobs,"Is good, but needs a preemie section to choose","I have been using this app for all four of my pregnancies. My fourth was a bit different than my other three because he was born late preterm. I was hoping that since his birth date was so different than the due date documented on app, it would give me the option to choose a preemie schedule, but it didn‚Äôt. The measuring of the growth tracker is not by any means correct since not only was he preemie, but a big preemie, but the growth tracker is basing my child with full term babies. I‚Äôm about to delete this app since it is not giving me the help I need with this child."
332,332,4,2018-10-03T16:57:09.000Z,Bavavgav,Interesting topics but...,"This application is simple, clear and friendly. I advise the content to encourage women more to go for natural deliveries and to stay active during pregnancy (yoga, aerobics, cardio...) to try hypnobirth, doulas, midwives, chiropractic approach, daily meditation and breathing exercises and to really encourage women to go for a full vegan diet (it completely stops all pregnancy side effects and has a big impact on baby health forever and labor/delivery) plus all the above shortens labor by half and takes out all medications, fears, even hospital delivery. Going back to nature is the best for mommies üòä keep the great work"
333,333,5,2021-08-09T15:07:18.000Z,MAnoteworthy,"Weeks/days are long but the years, they are short","You hear this often and you only feel it once you‚Äôre in the waiting game. Waiting for the exciting development of your baby from the moment you know he or she is forming in you. This app is a great milestone marker along the way. I love(d) getting weekly updates about what I can expect from my fetus-infant-toddler-preschooler. It‚Äôs also great to get a second stream going once i had my #2, there‚Äôs so much we for get."
334,334,5,2021-07-27T12:22:34.000Z,FAMU RN,Journey of life,"I really do like using this app, the week by week, giving you examples of how big your baby is , what symptoms you may be feeling at this part of your gestation ways to communicate to your family and to your partner about how the baby is growing a healthy tips to take care of yourself and the baby during your pregnancy. I also used this app when I lost my first baby and the app also gave me information on how to deal with grieving in a fetal loss and resources"
335,335,5,2021-03-22T13:19:58.000Z,Jennifersue000,Informative and Helpful,"I have used this app to track both of my pregnancies as well as my children‚Äôs milestones and development for their first year. The app is easy-to-use and helpful. The birthing boards are also helpful and sometimes entertaining. Overall, I would recommend this app to anyone who is expecting. I tried several during my first pregnancy and found that Baby Center had the best layout and most convenient presentation of information."
336,336,5,2021-02-01T10:00:47.000Z,Ming Li Yung,Oh baby üçº üë∂ ‚ÄºÔ∏è,Baby Center is by far the best app I currently have on my phone . It has helped me get through. My first trimester without having to worry or question certain symptoms or changes in my body. Keeping track of my pregnancy ü§∞ week by week month by month with the Baby Center App is reassuring and I‚Äôm so glad I downloaded it‚ÄºÔ∏è This app is perfect for first time parents as well as the more experienced ones . I‚Äôm carrying üë∂ baby #2 and boy am I delighted !! Download the BABYCENTER app today ...üöªüöº
337,337,5,2019-10-02T03:47:08.000Z,CaseyLT,Look no further than Baby Center,"Baby Center literally has content on every aspect of motherhood from pregnancy to childbirth, and caring for a baby. If you have a question, any question, especially those really panicky ones that pop into your head at 3am- go straight to Baby Center. There's a high likelihood they have some information that will give you peace of mind or at least give you information so that you can have a more informed discussion with your doctor."
338,338,4,2020-10-15T15:41:55.000Z,Lorae215,Very informative,"This is my first time being pregnant so this app is keeping me informed on a lot of things I didn‚Äôt know about my baby‚Äôs development and also about how my body is developing too, I also like that it keeps track of how many weeks I am. I only bad part is that I put in my baby info saying that I‚Äôm having a boy but in all my development facts and stuff they keep saying her, I keep double checking to see if I selected boy and I did but they keep saying her or she it‚Äôs really annoying. Only reason I rated the app 4 stars"
339,339,4,2019-08-22T03:38:50.000Z,EvyNY,I would give 5 starts if we were able to change our screen name.,"The app is amazing but unfortunately not 5stars for not giving us the option to be able to change our screen name. A lot of us put last names and got divorced, or a certain date and got a miscarriage, then we are stuck with that name and are forced to delete the account and reopen a new one loosing everything we have such as friends, badges, comments, posts... baby center please do something about it?! Thank you so much! :)"
340,340,4,2019-01-05T12:33:55.000Z,MrsAndHerMiddles,The photo stickers need editing,"I really enjoy this app; however, the stickers intended for the bump pictures need some slight editing. For example, when you combine them to read the size of your baby, you‚Äôll be forced to use the grammatically incorrect sentence ‚ÄúAs big as poppy seed‚Äù or ‚ÄúAs long as kidney bean‚Äù. This might not bother some, but I intended to print these pictures for my pregnancy journal, but can‚Äôt with the grammatical errors. This would be a simple fix of just adding the word ‚Äúa‚Äù or ‚Äúan‚Äù in front of the food items (‚ÄúAs big as a poppy seed‚Äù)."
341,341,4,2019-03-20T05:21:45.000Z,boobooknuckle,My fav of all pregnancy apps!,I love that we can post pictures! It makes things so much easier when asking for help and advice and we have pictures for a lore clear cut answer. Like asking about my mucus plug and if what I showed was it as opposed to guessing. I got quick answers. Unlike on Ovia you can‚Äôt post pictures so you are just guessing what people are talking about and have to type out a whole essay describing what you are trying to talk or ask about.
342,342,5,2021-06-27T01:00:56.000Z,Kiaya23b,Baby center,"This app is so great !!! I absolutely love it. This app keeps up with the week and day of your baby, and it gives you new and exciting information every week to show you how your baby is growing. I think it's just amazing, all the little questions and wonders about your baby is answered on this app. At the beginning you may think that nothing is happening but the app will tell you every little thing that is going on that will surprise you."
343,343,5,2021-06-26T20:19:39.000Z,Iw_FUZZ920,Have used with both my babies üôè,"Baby center is such an easy way to connect with other moms and learn about yourself and your baby as you go through your pregnancy. The birth month groups are so helpful, especially your first time around when everything is so new and you have questions and curiosities about everything, it‚Äôs nice to share experiences with others. The app is easy to use and fun to show your kiddo‚Äôs and spouse your babies‚Äô progress."
344,344,5,2021-03-31T15:02:22.000Z,Blessedtimesfour,Wish this was around for my first 3 kids!,"I love this app! So my kids range from (brace yourself) 21 years old to a new baby 3 months old! Hubby and I were high school sweethearts and apparently still so in love LoL!  :) I have a 2 year old and she‚Äôs my only girl and this was my discovery of this amazing app. So much valuable information and my favorite is tracking the stages and sizes. My 21, 19 and 14 year old sons are awesome but boy this app would have been so great for a young mama. Thanks so much for the wonderful content."
345,345,5,2021-03-16T13:04:20.000Z,HenandezM,Such a good app,I‚Äôve been using this app since I found out I was pregnant back in 2019. I‚Äôve used it almost everyday during and after my pregnancy. It does a great job at explaining the process one goes through and the baby goes through (keep in mind that everyone is different) It‚Äôll suggest things for mom and baby and also partner! I appreciate the app- it‚Äôs never glitched or anything like that. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll delete it. It‚Äôs been a good year and 3 months for me!
346,346,5,2020-01-27T14:46:53.000Z,45tessa,The best,I love the baby center app! It‚Äôs all around and was very instrumental to my mental health when I was suffering from infertility. There were so many moms and group and forums to utilize and I found myself on the app all the time looking for information. When I got pregnant I enjoyed the weekly updates on how far along I was and now that my baby is here I get updates on his progress or what to look for throughout his growth. I love this app and I rarely leave reviews but this one was very deserving!
347,347,3,2020-05-12T05:24:41.000Z,ElyyCabb08,"Great app, hate the new layout","This app always stood out from the rest of the apps and was easy to navigate. When I opened the app and saw the new layout, I was confused thinking I clicked the wrong app because it looks like every other baby app. Really bummed out because even though it‚Äôs a sleek modern look, it‚Äôs not easy to navigate, the dates are off, it no longer goes day by day and you have to fish around digging for what used to be there on the home screen. Hopefully they give an option to switch between old/new version for those who prefer the old version."
348,348,5,2019-12-30T01:17:04.000Z,Luvelyceci,Love this app!!!,"I used it when I had my first child 8 years ago. Recommend it to my cousin when she had her baby 2 years ago and now that I‚Äôm pregnant, I started using it again. Love the fact that it shows me week by week the size of my baby and what is developing during that week. Not only during your pregnancy but also after the baby is born. Makes me feel more like I know what‚Äôs going in with my baby‚Äôs development before and after."
349,349,5,2019-09-11T16:30:23.000Z,kelykley210,Best app- like a unique pregnancy friend!,"I love this app... it‚Äôs so nicely organized and intuitive. The articles are approachable and completely relevant, pretty much to the day! It‚Äôs like it could sense when I had a new symptom I was unsure of and before I would bring myself to the scary world of googling my symptoms it would notify me that I may be experiencing symptom a, b, and c at this point and that it was normal. Highly recommend this to anyone and I honestly wouldn‚Äôt have had as good a pregnancy experience without it!"
350,350,5,2017-10-30T05:47:41.000Z,Acslv,First time !!!!!!!,It's exiting to have this app as a first time parent it's amazing to see your baby's progress. As a father we don't get to experience all the changes that happen with everyday or every week. Which makes us unaware of of baby's and mother needs. With this app I get to read and see information about the changes that happen and helps me to look out for my wife needs. So thank you for BabyCenter you are not just an app but also part of the team.
351,351,4,2018-02-03T16:00:16.000Z,Drintraining,"Great app, needs more info for twins","The only reason I‚Äôm giving it four stars instead of five is that I am having twins and the app is 98% geared towards a singleton baby. Having twins is quite a different experience and it would have been great to have more information and articles available. That being said, I did really enjoy the app and the information provided. I liked that there was something new ever day, the size of your baby (again different with two!), and the additional features. Overall a great app."
352,352,5,2018-02-12T12:23:22.000Z,Coley Oleg,Wonderful and Informative App!,This app is awesome for me as a new first time mother. They send me a ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre now .. Weeks Pregnant! See how your baby looks this week‚Äù every time I turn a new week pregnant and it makes me so happy and excited! Love getting notifications like that in the morning. Very informative on information and I use it a lot to ask very common questions that others have answered years ago! Would 10/10 recommend this app to any pregnant mommy to be! *and I do!
353,353,5,2018-05-05T07:40:54.000Z,Yoloabshdndv,Beat app ever,"This app has been with me since the day I found out I was pregnant, it helped me prepare as I waited to be a mom, it showed me pictures and videos of what my baby looked like every week! Till the day she was born, and then it taught me tricks for soothing my fussy baby, and helped me get through the hard times with the other mothers input. Honestly if it wasn‚Äôt for this app I would have been totally lost... my baby is now going to be 1 and I want to thank everyone who made this app!!!"
354,354,5,2018-05-16T13:19:31.000Z,New Mommy in Maine,"Super helpful, encourages you to be open minded","During my first pregnancy I initially only used this app to track the size of my baby. As time went on the app proved to have shared interesting and insightful information about different types of pregnancies. It seems unbiased, and encourages you to keep an open mind about your options and decisions you‚Äôll have to make as new parents. I especially liked the free videos that take you through Labor, it was like a free Lamaze class!"
355,355,5,2018-06-05T19:07:24.000Z,billllllie,Great bc free,It's one of the few free apps that lets you keep track of your pregnancy with great tips and weekly updates on what to expect in changes to your body and also what new developments your baby is going through that week. Great visuals and comparisons with useful informational videos. Also has a great forum for moms and expecting moms that have questions for people who are going through the same thing or have been through the same thing for a good Peace of mind. ....AND ITS FREE THE BEST PART.
356,356,5,2018-09-03T14:51:09.000Z,N.Jan,All pregnant mothers need this app!,Whether its your first child or whether it's your last this app keeps a pregnant mom going. I check it everyday to have updates on my baby and my pregnancy. With this app I feel like my symptoms are normal and I feel like this pregnancy is actually one of the best things in life I can experience because it brings me closer to my baby and boyfriend. He downloaded it too to keep track of our little ones.  My Pregnancy Today is a must have!
357,357,5,2021-06-23T03:30:05.000Z,jusanothermom,Such a GREAT resource,"Honestly, I am so so thankful for this free app. I used it throughout my first pregnancy and now I‚Äôll be using it during my second. It has answered so many of my random- and not so random- questions and has really given me peace of mind about symptoms I experience and about my babies. I have t used it much since having my baby but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just as useful for raising kiddos too! Maybe I will try that out more now that I‚Äôll be using it during pregnancy #2. :)"
358,358,5,2019-10-25T14:41:25.000Z,sshaynaa,LOVE IT,I love everything about this app. It not only gives you updated information about your baby‚Äôs development during your pregnancy but it also gives you updates about your own body and what you may be experiencing week to week - month to month. Oh and I love that you continue to track you baby after birth thats awesome! I love knowing what they should be doing next and how to help them reach their milestones. The pictures are fabulous!
359,359,5,2019-06-15T23:45:25.000Z,The Dalton Gang,Great app!!,"I have been using this app since finding out I was pregnant at 7 weeks gestation. It has allowed me to track growth, learn information relevant to me and my baby, and let our other children and my spouse feel included! Now that our little boy is here we are able to get even more information about his growth. I would highly recommend every new mother use this app!! I‚Äôm mother of 5 and still found it to be very helpful and reassuring!! Thank you!!"
360,360,4,2017-09-13T13:28:18.000Z,Buttbuddy696959696969659695,Love the app but it's days are confusing,"So far the app has been great. I've had to modify my due date because I'll go through the week like normal, then I'll get to day 7, which on my other apps takes me to the next week (ex: 7 weeks 7 days on the BabyCenter app is 8 weeks on all my other pregnancy apps). It's confusing to me and it's frankly annoyed me a little because I want to get the exact day's information. If I leave it be then it leaves me a day behind or a day ahead and I don't know why. Other than that I like it."
361,361,3,2019-04-17T13:21:04.000Z,Wenpol,Unable to log in.,"I‚Äôm giving a 3 star rate because every time i want ir need to read something about the development of my baby it doesn‚Äôt allow me to log in automatically. They send me emails and when I click on them to read more about the subject I‚Äôm interested on it redirects me to the application but asks me to log in and I do and it doesn‚Äôt logs me in. So it really annoys me because as a mother of a baby I have no time to log in all the time. I don‚Äôt know if this issue can be fixed, I don‚Äôt know if to others have happened before. Othe than that the app is very helpful."
362,362,5,2019-06-04T05:17:56.000Z,NomNom123 brains,Amazing app,"Having the feature of being able to track exactly how far along I was to the day was amazing. Even when my due date changed it was easy to change it in the app so it was up to date. Also the pictures showing what size your baby is compared to fruit and vegetables is a really nice feature, I always went to the store to buy what the food of the week was to see how heavy and long my baby was."
363,363,5,2021-07-24T17:29:51.000Z,DemeDior,My go to app,"I‚Äôm on baby #3 and baby center app has never let me down. Always provides insight on what to expect in the weeks and months ahead giving you the heads up on what stage your baby is going through throughout the pregnancy. I also love the fact that they go beyond to recommend healthy food options, include the birth clubs, and provides all kind of overall tips for mom during pregnancy and even after birth. This app is a game changer! Love it!!!"
364,364,5,2021-05-05T23:27:10.000Z,Summering7,Best pregnancy & baby app!! Highly recommend it!,Its the greatest app I found so far and very informative. It caters to all kinds of parenting and mentions many topics which parents might go through. Their advice is very useful and the information is up to date. I was never disappointed from day 20 (when I downloaded it) of my pregnancy till my baby‚Äôs birth and still using to learn about my kids growth.
365,365,3,2021-05-21T13:54:40.000Z,Brooke8998,Tracker doesn‚Äôt update,I am pleased with all of the features of the app except the actual tracking. I will get notifications that I‚Äôm XX weeks and days along but when I go into the app it doesn‚Äôt show that. Sometimes it will take a few days but currently it says I‚Äôm 11weeks5days when I‚Äôm actually 13weeks today.... you can change the home page to be on whatever week you want which somewhat fixes this but it still says I‚Äôm looking 2weeks ahead. Maybe I just got a lemon because other people on my birth board doesn‚Äôt seem to have this issue...
366,366,5,2021-03-13T02:09:28.000Z,mellowmacybender,Ya‚Äôll got lucky!,"Look, I normally don‚Äôt do reviews ‚Äî at all. This is my first review ever. Maybe it‚Äôs the hormones (duh) but this app is very informative and as a young woman who couldn‚Äôt get to my doctor until around 12 weeks ‚Äòcause tricare took forever to obtain; this app was all I had. I will forever thank God for this app."
367,367,5,2020-11-29T14:35:15.000Z,Krishfjbk,The best,"This app has helped me a looooot. I tracked my baby through every single milestone before delivery and now after delivery, I joined birth club. There are hundreds of helpful people who respond with in hours and many times gave wonderful suggestions to raise my little one. I‚Äôm extremely happy with the app and am recommending it to every single Friend of mine who are pregnant. It feels happy to know that you are not alone and also someone else is there for you. Highly recommended!"
368,368,5,2020-05-06T05:22:21.000Z,Mama Roxyrocks,Long time fan,Giving this app 5 stars for so many reasons. The first reason is for all the rich information it has. Second reason is I love how it follows u from pregnancy to baby. And lastly I love how I can refer back to the app if I have any questions I can just get some of my answers through this app.
369,369,1,2020-08-11T23:46:12.000Z,Thisisbubbleking8790653,Group owners BULLY members,"I was only on this app for an hr before I began getting bullied by 2 forumn owners in the ‚Äútrying to conceive‚Äù group. Zicc and IVFwarrior attacked me and would not stop commenting on my post being extremely rude over me asking a simple question. Luckily many of the group members came in my defense and expressed concern over how I was being treated and answered my question politely. It sounds far fetched but if I had receipts to show I would. Unfortunately right when everyone came to my rescue they deleted the post. I could not believe people in a pregnancy app of all places would treat people like that. Deleting this app and finding a different one. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE TRYING TO CONCEIVE GROUP!! If you do, watch out for ZICC AND IVFWARRIOR. ONLINE BULLIES!"
370,370,4,2017-12-20T05:04:52.000Z,Gleeben,My favorite baby app,"I tried a handful of pregnancy/baby apps and this is my favorite. I like all the tools/ baby names, bumpies, is it safe etc, and the article suggestions every week are great. The community is generally supportive and mature, unlike some of the other apps that seemed to be filled with exclusively19 year old trolls. The only thing it‚Äôs missing from other apps is a daily display at the top that gives you estimated weight/length, and countdown for how many days are left. I like that I can keep using it once he‚Äôs born too."
371,371,5,2018-02-28T00:32:02.000Z,Royal_pete,Trust me greatest pregnancy app.,"It has everything. Love the pictures the options, the stage by stage information on the pregnancy and all the information about literally everything you should know to help you with your pregnancy, and what‚Äôs even better this app connects you to a community of women who are due to give birth in the same month as you so that along your pregnancy you have other women who you can communicate with about what you‚Äôre going through."
372,372,5,2018-06-05T13:02:32.000Z,Niko0w,It has so many information,"I‚Äôm a second time mother, my big boy have 4 years and my newborn girl of three weeks. I have done this before and let me tell you, they‚Äôre so different. My boy was so sleepy and he sleep through the night so fast. My newborn not so much she stays awake after feeding and she don‚Äôt sleep through the night and this app help me get her to sleep, help me get track of feedings and diaper changes. Even help me on burping, my baby will thank you, I‚Äôm getting better!"
373,373,5,2019-04-06T13:20:08.000Z,Uruu Patel,"Love this app, highly recommended",I‚Äôve been using his app from the beginning of my first pregnancy and while my baby is growing and developing. The weekly updates have been my favorite way to learn what‚Äôs going on in my belly while he was an embryo and fetus and still I love the weekly updates and what to expect coming up. When I have questions baby center always has an article or videos about everything! I love this app and the knowledge I have gained as a new mom.
374,374,5,2021-08-11T13:25:02.000Z,OldSandals,Better than all the books!,"After having my fourth child, twelve years after my last, I can easily say that Baby Center and your doctor can give you all the information you need to have an informed pregnancy. Even though I had been through pregnancy and babies three times before, I‚Äôve really enjoyed having Baby Center as a resource. It helps you know what to expect and what to do without instilling fear. Thank you Baby Center!"
375,375,5,2021-06-27T17:20:14.000Z,Lala599099,App,I absolutely Love this app it has got me through so many questions that I have that I want to text somebody else and now I don‚Äôt have to ask anybody because of this app gives you so much great information saved you a lot of time on looking stuff up. Plus it gives you updates every time you reach a new week which I think it‚Äôs just great because it‚Äôs great to know what‚Äôs going on with my baby and my body as a first-time parent
376,376,5,2021-05-31T23:43:39.000Z,Marie_Mia,My savior and I still use it,The fact that I don‚Äôt have to pay for this app is just a blessing and from the start of my pregnancy till this very day I still love and use this app!!!! I have recommended it to all my friends and family. I just hope this app helps everyone as much as it always helps me!!!!! Baby 2 on the way and this was my first app to turn to again üíïüòªü•∞ü§© it helped me so much as a first time to understand my whole pregnancy journey
377,377,5,2021-04-07T15:50:14.000Z,Lori 84,Love this app,"Going on 3 years of using it since my first pregnancy and I love it. Keeps track of my toddler as well as my baby on the way. Only glitch is that sometimes when opening it from an email or my notifications on iOS phone, it doesn‚Äôt take you directly to your app already logged in. It‚Äôll seem as if your logged out but you have to close the app and go to the link again. It‚Äôs the only kink I‚Äôve found so far."
378,378,5,2020-07-20T17:10:24.000Z,Gerrilyn M.,Love everything about this App!,As a first time mom I have/had a lot of questions. I have definitely appreciated the weekly reminder each time I enter a new week and what each week of development brings. The supplemental information regarding pregnancy symptoms and what you can expect as normal or an emergency have also helped keep me calm and manage expectations :) Now I‚Äôm entering the season where I need to count kicks and the kick counter is so cute and helpful! Love this app!
379,379,5,2020-05-21T18:15:06.000Z,LL.Smith,The most informative and accurate App.,"This is by far the most informative and accurate app for keeping up with your baby‚Äôs progress and pregnancy. We are expecting baby#2 and we love how it keeps up with your child‚Äôs growth development, what to expect and  open chat groups for different parents. We used this app for both of our children. And I love how it shows you the image and detail of what your baby looks like each week."
380,380,5,2017-10-06T07:52:41.000Z,sofiamour,My guidance after the doctor,"I am using this app since my early pregnancy. I am amazed by the fact that it is so accurate about what I will be encountering with my 7 month old little one every week. Apart from that, all the useful info come in full coordination with my doctor's advice. Plus once I had some questions regarding the articles, I had an e-mailed answer right to me, on the next 24 hours explaining everything. These things build up trust."
381,381,5,2018-05-16T14:05:13.000Z,SandyM0323,Great App for expecting & new moms,"Helps track fetal development and growth after baby arrives. I like that emails are sent with weekly progress updates. Be sure to sign up for the emails as there is info there that is not on the app. That would be my suggestion for improvement, have a link to the emailed info on the app so curious moms like me (that read at 3am during feedings) can access all info available in one place. Otherwise the app is great! Love and recommend it!"
382,382,5,2018-05-26T12:04:38.000Z,Mrs Gabe Smith,Love this app!! THANK YOU BabyCenter!!,I am a first time mom going through my first pregnancy and I am so thankful that I have this app to guide me!! I love the daily/weekly countdown and helpful articles. I love that I can search for articles and even for discussion posts from other moms about questions or issues I may come across as I progress in my pregnancy. I love the bumpie feature which reminds me to take a weekly picture of my belly. Overall the app is fun and gives me a lot of peace of mind.
383,383,5,2018-10-11T16:04:02.000Z,Lut Clarcq,Great informational app,Thank you so much for this wonderful app. It has helped me and still guides me every week on what to expect. This is my first pregnancy and your app has full of information and it is just amazing.
384,384,4,2019-05-18T14:35:21.000Z,steenb4,Review,It been fun to track my growing babe week to week the only thing that bottlers me I‚Äôm having a boy and every article talks as if I‚Äôm having a girl. Just don‚Äôt see the point of customizing gender along with the birthdate of it doesn‚Äôt reflect in your weekly info. Also found some other apps give you a little more info week to week. While sometimes this one seems to not give you many changes week to week. Other then that it‚Äôs been user friendly and informative in the articles and q&a
385,385,5,2019-06-03T13:11:09.000Z,juliasmrk,Love it,"I found this app very helpful through the pregnancy and especially while breastfeeding. Reading a lot of useful information at one place is very convenient. This app doesn‚Äôt have contradictions, it makes you more calm and even cool that I can do this. Every time I finished the article, I felt courage to parent by baby. I trust you, guys. Hope to see more interesting information."
386,386,5,2020-04-24T16:34:47.000Z,dollface.salon,My favorite baby app,I used a different app at the beginning of my pregnancy but the tracker was incorrect so I switched to Babycenter and I‚Äôm glad I did! I love all of the articles they have for each week. It helped me to know what to expect for my first pregnancy and into the first few months of having a new baby. I look forward to their weekly updates of what to look for in my baby and ideas for fun games to play with her that encourage that development.
387,387,5,2019-12-10T16:55:05.000Z,Dan Wash,LOVE IT!!,"This is honestly the best app ever to keep me updated on my baby. It really gets down to details and graphics. I get notifications that are very helpful and I really enjoy knowing exactly when I am a certain number of weeks pregnant. If it wasn‚Äôt for this app, I would be so lost lol That was when I was pregnant and now that I‚Äôve had my baby I still get a lot of details and notifications that are so helpful and fun! I love this app and recommend it to ALL parents. THANK YOI BABY CENTER!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
388,388,5,2019-11-19T23:30:30.000Z,Gernzie,Grandma,"My daughter is pregnant for the first time with a baby girl.  I signed up for this app to follow along with all the changes she will be going through and to learn things I didn‚Äôt know when I was pregnant with her 37 years ago.  I am enjoying her journey with this excellent informative and very interesting app.  I get emails every week with an update on how the baby is developing.  Of course, the app is focused on mom with all sorts of health, baby, and preparations needed when baby comes.   I love it!"
389,389,5,2019-06-19T01:08:06.000Z,MamaMichael99,Love this app.,"I‚Äôve been using this app since i found out I was pregnant at 5 weeks (6 weeks postpartum now) and I love it. I always looked forward to seeing how big my baby was and how he was developing. My only complaint is that sometimes people can be pretty mean on the app, but that‚Äôs anywhere. Overall, babycenter makes you feel a little less alone in your journey of motherhood! Definitely recommend if you‚Äôre trying to conceive/are pregnant."
390,390,5,2017-08-13T04:05:38.000Z,dreagurl720,Love keeping track of my baby!,"I started using this app late in my pregnancy and really liked it. My baby is 5 months old now and I still open this app up every single day. I love how it gives info pertaining to the progression and development of my baby. All the tips are appreciated and there are so many tools to utilize within as well. Surprisingly, the chat groups have been super helpful also. It's nice to get support from other first time moms like myself."
391,391,5,2018-06-11T14:13:32.000Z,Mrs. Kusiak,Use it for years!,"I have a 4 year old and an 8 month old. Baby Center is my go-to for any questions I have, growth development insights, and learning more about what to expect with my growing family. I have loved the growth charts, with my infant son who was almost labeled failure to thrive, and then also keeping up with my daughter‚Äôs stats because having a newborn makes it hard to remember these things. I love this app and can‚Äôt say enough on how it saves my sanity as a mother!"
392,392,5,2021-07-30T09:09:38.000Z,rpooja,This app is everything,"This app was everything for me when I was pregnant even till my baby turned one. I will highly recommend it those who re getting pregnant or pregnant already or they have delivered baby you will get all your confusion clear answer of any questions everything related. Trust me. Not even nutrition, food, toy, I mean everything even it helps me to choose my baby name. Love love love this appp. If it has any option I would give10 star."
393,393,5,2021-01-12T17:44:20.000Z,LoriHobbes,Amazing for First Time Pregnancies,"The app tracks the baby and the changes in your body, so it was very comforting as a first time pregnant woman. I also like how diverse all the articles are - there‚Äôs information and research on just about anything you want to know on there. I also enjoyed being part of a forum with other moms due around the same time as me. I could ask them questions and feel comforted that I wasn‚Äôt alone in any of my worries or anticipations."
394,394,4,2021-01-26T04:47:26.000Z,Kiannalanell0817,Overall I enjoyed the app!,"I loved keeping track of my growth and the babies during my pregnancy. It is also nice to contact with other mothers who are going through similar things you are. The only thing I genuinely disliked was some of the very rude members within some of the birth groups or different groups. Of course, these groups allow free and open conversation but they can really be such a negative experience for some users. Some people are just not nice but other than that the app works very well."
395,395,5,2020-11-06T01:16:05.000Z,Sawarren,Love it!! Community after birth is the best!,"As a new mom during this pandemic I love having a support group to ask questions to. The pregnancy tracker was good, I didn‚Äôt look much though except for what fruit my baby was the size of. The group chat for moms/dads according to the birth month is awesome. Everyone else is at the same point I‚Äôm at so it‚Äôs been very helpful asking questions. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm doing this all alone. I have no tech issues with the app itself."
396,396,5,2021-07-04T16:40:15.000Z,Chrissy L Davis,Review by Christina D,This app is great! The information listed as each week goes by is very helpful. I share it with my boyfriend as the weeks go by and it‚Äôs cool to be able to share that information with him because other wise he would have no clue lol üòÇ especially the symptom part. Thank you for making such a useful and user friendly app to help us expecting mothers during this exciting time in our lives!! A+++ rating from this Momma!
397,397,5,2021-04-08T15:43:57.000Z,jazmin-m,Amazing app - everything you will need to know,"If is your first baby or even the second it doesn‚Äôt matter this app will teach you / remind you what‚Äôs going on with your baby on each step. Works perfectly with any life style, you can read it while you are feeding your baby or before going to bed. It‚Äôs super interesting I love it !! I used for my first baby and now for the second one to remind me things that maybe I didn‚Äôt read"
398,398,5,2021-04-08T02:48:37.000Z,Jessalexcox21,Jessalex,"This app is great! It‚Äôs full of good info, links and tips. I love that it also connects you to other moms with similar due dates. Overall I have enjoyed it! The only thing I would change is that I didn‚Äôt always feel the vegetables or fruits they used to represent baby‚Äôs size were accurate or a good example of baby‚Äôs development but that‚Äôs just my opinion. This has been a great app to have throughout my first pregnancy and a great resource as well!"
399,399,5,2021-01-26T17:59:46.000Z,Ek876446838,Best prenatal app,"I absolutely love this app! From the beginning when I hid my pregnancy to now sharing all the little growths and facts with my daughter, it has helped me grow through it all. From answering weird questions and concerns, to fun growing baby and mom facts, I would definitely recommend. The community forum is awesome as well. You get to connect with other moms, hear what their questions or concerns may be, and make new friends. Definitely would recommend the app!"
400,400,5,2020-12-30T10:34:41.000Z,jdavids6,Great!!,"I‚Äôve  Used this app since around week 5 of pregnancy and still  continue to even tho my baby is 2 months old‚Äî- I still love reading about his development and the fun little surprises I learn about him! Great app with lots of extras but If you like cute pictures, maybe not for you.... if you just want good information with more realistic pics of baby it‚Äôs perfect. And you still get to see how your baby is the ‚Äúsize of an avocado‚Äù or whatever!!"
401,401,5,2020-11-30T16:16:27.000Z,Lilyeun,Helpful resource,"Each week I‚Äôm looking forward to the information provided by the app. It‚Äôs simple and not too wordy. There is also a community resource of other moms in the same due date period, which I would go into comment or learn every now and then."
402,402,5,2020-05-06T03:36:44.000Z,Tweetie14,Love this app,"I have loved this app since I became pregnant with my son! I loved watching each week to see how big he was, also to see him developing. Once I had him I kept with the app for his first year to watch what his next move might be. It made me feel more connected as a new mom. He is almost a year old. It‚Äôs bittersweet to know my son has graduated from the baby app. But when we have our next child, I will definitely be using this app again!"
403,403,2,2020-06-19T06:25:27.000Z,ktw300,Negativity,"I love everything about this app, except the bullies. I‚Äôve seen it so many times.. a mom asks a simple question and gets negative sarcastic comments. Why can‚Äôt they just ignore it? I was seriously bullied for my post  about being Christian and was told I have white privilege by ‚Äúcommunity owners‚Äù when in fact I never said my race. After that post a community owner bullied me on a totally different posts and other posters would comment pictures making fun of Jesus. That is not okay. I hate going on the app now because I just want to ask questions but I will be bullied just because of my ‚Äú white privilege & religion ‚Äú it makes me sad.."
404,404,3,2020-05-30T23:42:49.000Z,KiiroDunn,Great app!,"Honestly, this a great app and I love what they did when they updated it. But now that it‚Äôs been updated, nothing loads. It‚Äôs always a blank screen. It‚Äôs annoying because every time I want to look at what the new week is like, whether it‚Äôs my body or the baby, it never loads and it‚Äôs just a white screen. And some articles will load which is nice but if it doesn‚Äôt, I just try to remember what the title was and look it up on the internet instead. Maybe it‚Äôs a bug but it‚Äôs still an okay app. I‚Äôd just wait for a new update before downloading this app."
405,405,3,2020-05-08T12:34:03.000Z,KemAJLS,"Good experience for the while, then it fell apart","I looked forward to checking the app each week, as I watched my baby grow. There is useful information and the articles are quite good. However, it wasn‚Äôt the only app I was using. I found others more engaging, as they added something new each day, versus just on a weekly basis. Then, after 5 months of use, I needed to log back in to the Baby Centre app each time I wanted to use the app. That ultimately ruined the experience. This happened first every 3 days, and then every day. So, I just deleted the app."
406,406,5,2020-03-02T10:13:21.000Z,lhallberg1186,Every new parent‚Äôs peace of mind,"Can‚Äôt tell you how many times I have come to your app and been put at ease by simply gaining more knowledge. Being a new parent is hard in so many ways. BabyCenter is just so easy to navigate and has so much information on so many different topics. Not to mention the weekly notifications from pregnancy to your growing baby, how they grow, what to expect, things to consider, it‚Äôs just beautiful. Oh and truly free!! Thanks BabyCenter!"
407,407,5,2019-10-05T17:30:47.000Z,SkyeJ2020,Awesome for new moms,"I love this app!  I am 20 years old and this is my first pregnancy. It has been an emotional rollercoaster but Babycenter has helped me through it. I get to monitor my little babies growth week by week. It also gives information on what to expect with my symptoms. I love being able to have an album of my baby bump. I also love that I can chat with other ladies expecting the same time as I am. I highly recommended this, especially for new moms."
408,408,1,2019-11-20T07:12:34.000Z,mrs.cordle0101,Ahh,"I would give this star a 5 star but u just can‚Äôt bring myself too it. People can be very very rude and judgmental on this app !!! I have literally deleted this app 2 times because this app does more mental damage from all the mean,hateful and careless people that are on it. They give good tips and good baby updates but just wish they would do something to make it more of a happy and positive app other then a judge mental , arguing 24/7 over some stupid stuff app like literally if you post more then one thing about one topic you will get jumped on by so many woman and it‚Äôs not even fun like literally it causes more stress then anything..... I would love this app if it wasn‚Äôt for all the bullying and judging!!!"
409,409,5,2019-06-24T08:10:33.000Z,stonethatgirl,So far the best,"Everything is so much easier and helpful. From just specifying what part of your last period to punch in to navigating the do‚Äôs and donts, suggestions of fun things to do (I.e starting weekly tummy pictures even in first trimester). So much information and such ease of getting it all. Loving this app much more than any of the others I‚Äôve downloaded so far."
410,410,5,2017-10-11T17:55:54.000Z,God the one and only,Thanks for the Info,"I was so so happy to find out I would be a mom and was fully prepared to do all that was expected of me. Now after downloading your app, I truly see how hard parenting can be so I decided not to carry it to full term. I loved that child and would have be so glad to raise it if it didn't require so much work but don't get the wrong idea. I couldn't just throw this small child in the trash along with the coat hanger so I decided to bury it in a shoebox in the backyard."
411,411,4,2018-05-09T13:46:04.000Z,wickedAmom,Good app,Good app. It updates you every week on how your baby is growing while your pregnant and once your baby is born. They have different topics each day of the week. These topics are helpful and informative. The only thing I found as a tiny negative was if I had a specific question trying to find the answer wasn‚Äôt as easy as I would have liked. But I just googled my question and just clicked on the link for the answer that was on this app. Would definitely recommend this to any new Mom to be.
412,412,5,2018-05-13T13:07:44.000Z,cafm22,Great App! Highly recommend,"Great app!!!! Especially for first time moms. Baby center has a lot of valuable information, tips and videos to help you on your journey. It was exciting to get updates on my baby‚Äôs growth which were pretty accurate. I also loved when it switched over after my baby was born. I was not expecting it to continue after she was born. The continued information and advice has helped a lot. I highly recommend this app"
413,413,5,2018-07-17T04:45:35.000Z,adchick402,The only pregnancy app I still use,"I started my pregnancy by downloading 3 pregnancy apps (What to Expect, Bump, and BabyCenter). Now at 13 weeks, BabyCenter is the only one I still use daily. Every day updates with new baby growth updates, articles, and tips. My favorite feature is the Birth Club, a forum of other moms-to-be with the same due date as you. Great for connecting, sharing, and asking questions with women who are going through the same thing as you."
414,414,5,2018-07-29T18:59:58.000Z,Cupcakekittymew,I love this app,"It tells me everything Im curious about and always has interesting facts. I also love all the polls and I especially love seeing the baby‚Äôs progress every week! My favorite thing about the app is all the details about the baby‚Äôs progress, I cry every single time üòù‚ò∫Ô∏è This app is great because its everything you would find in a parenting book, but free, paperless, and unbiased!"
415,415,5,2018-11-07T00:12:43.000Z,SIX O,From a Dad,My wife and I downloaded this app to track the status of our pregnancy. As a dad I was able to see and understand everything that my wife was seeing and I was able to celebrate her accomplishments throughout the entire pregnancy. Because of this app I became more aware and knowledgeable about the stages of my wife‚Äôs pregnancy and the development of our child. Overall this app is exceptional. Now our son in 12 mo. and we are still engaged
416,416,4,2018-12-20T16:20:04.000Z,pennyf91,Just avoid the birth club discussions,Unless you‚Äôre into social media drama.

I downloaded it as I found out I was expecting (@ 7 weeks) & learned many new things EVERY WEEK about the growth of my baby. It was exciting to know what was happening inside of me. Almost a year later, I still use this app to inform myself  about the stages of my baby who is 11 months & what to expect on X week . I am able to prep myself beforehand and gather the necessary items to help my baby out during his first year ."

It helps you look forward to milestones during your pregnancy and shows you what your baby should look like during each week. It helps during pregnancy to have this every week to look forward to!

I made one shortly after and never looked back. 17 months later and the information is just as useful as before. Week after week, I learn something new about my child. There is also a feature that allows you to store measurements and track your baby‚Äôs growth. Simply put, Baby Center is a must-have for every stage!"
420,420,5,2017-10-27T22:43:15.000Z,seemarenisha,Love,Use this app all the time. Love it. Only thing I wish there was a search button inside the app because I usually end up using google for questions and I can find an answer from baby center and it will open it up in the app. So I wish I could just search from within the app. That's my l only issue I could think of but not that big of a deal. Used this during my pregnancy and still do my baby is 6 months now
421,421,5,2018-01-29T23:00:19.000Z,BlueDreamer88,Love it!,"Pregnancy can be so boring towards the end! I can‚Äôt wait to meet my daughter but also get depressed, anxious, worried, scared, everything possible.. this app keeps my mind occupied for hours no matter what mood or emotion I‚Äôm in that day üòã love it. The videos are great, articles are informative, and the support you get from other members seriously keeps me alive! No matter what your thinking there‚Äôs a thread to read or join so you can feel better or get answers!"
422,422,5,2018-05-26T00:37:46.000Z,moomerang,Best baby/pregnancy app,"I‚Äôve used this app/website for two pregnancies and children so far and it has helped me be a better mom.  It warns me when my baby is about to change so I‚Äôm not thrown off by it.  It gives great advice at just the right time.  I call the baby center emails my weekly ‚Äúmommy homework.‚Äù  When my husband asks me why our son is doing something weird I forward him the baby center email and he understands.  Get it.  You need it, parents."
423,423,2,2018-06-15T01:33:55.000Z,hannahlynn99,No option for twins/multiples,"Normally I would love this app, but beings there is no option for multiples of any kind I can not truly keep track of my babies development the same way as every other moms. Plus it only lists concerns that an average pregnancy would have to worry about and not the possible effects that having more than one could cause not only to the mother but to the other babies involved in said pregnancy. Granted having multiples isn‚Äôt as common but it would still be nice to be thought of especially for new moms as a starting ground who have no idea of what kind of questions to ask their doctors"
424,424,5,2018-09-02T03:50:14.000Z,ajsoto25,Great App,This is my first time using it and i have no complaints. Once you play around with the app like most apps you get the hang of it and it becomes easier. It has alot of helpful information and tips that come in handy for me and my spouse. He loves it because he gets to feel closer to me and the baby. Im only in my second trimester so i havent been able to use everything on the app but im sure i wont be disappointed when the time comes.
425,425,5,2019-01-24T17:44:26.000Z,momwithnewbaby1,A brilliant app,"I been using this app since the day I found out I was pregnant. It has many aspects I like about, the top one being that it follows you throughout ur whole journey of motherhood. From conception, pregnancy, birth, and so forth. It groups with other mom who due date is close to yours in the forums, you‚Äôll make lots of pen pals due to having similar experience for 9+ months. Also most of my googled questions links me back to this app. Highly recommend"
426,426,5,2021-01-29T13:14:15.000Z,SuperMom Labelle,9 year Client of 4 children,"I‚Äôve used BabyCenter, for 9 years with the 4 of my children that are now ages 8, 6, 2, and 3 weeks. This app has made pregnancy, and post-pregnancy so comfortable for me. Literally every question or concern I had I followed through with BabyCenter. I still receive information on my 8 year old through BabyCenter and I completely love this app for the guidance throughout the years of motherhood. Thank you for your blessings, this app means so much to me."
427,427,2,2021-03-12T10:59:18.000Z,bbbBBCbmc,Bad update,"The new update is terrible! Glitchy and difficult to use. This is my second pregnancy with the app, loved it the first time....this time, the community boards received a giant overhauling update that changed how to entire platform functions. Everyone is irate. Too many adds. Slow load times. Inability to bookmark. Getting bumped back to the start of the main board after you look at a post every single time. Ugh. Notifications super glitchy. I even downloaded What to Expect again (which I had previously deleted because I preferred this one) because using the app now is so difficult."
428,428,4,2021-01-11T16:57:17.000Z,Seame Street,The app is wonderful,"Honestly I do love the app. One of my favorite things about the app is the realistic progression of the child(ren). I always check the app and match it with what my doctor says and the information never was wrong for me. I wish it had a feature for multiples. Especially because I would love to see how multiples grow in a women‚Äôs stomach versus watch a singleton. I think that should be added on for the mommas. Other than that the app is really great, really easy to use and is all things about baby."
429,429,5,2021-07-29T16:13:18.000Z,Karin31720,Helpful,"Love this app. I like how it tracks my pregnancy to the current age of my baby. Every week and months are different and I learned what I need to know about the baby growth during pregnancy and how the baby develops physically and personality. It‚Äôs easy to search for more info that you‚Äôre not sure of like when your child have rashes or not well, suggestions to handling purple cry and so on. I highly recommend this app to all parents and parents to be."
430,430,3,2018-02-12T20:20:13.000Z,emthors,I like it- but there‚Äôs glitches,"The birth club is where you can connect with other pregnant women to get information and advice. However, the same conversation threads are repeated on the home screen and it always seems like it takes forever to update new posts to be shown. So I‚Äôm scrolling through the same thing over and over again. Once I‚Äôm in a conversation, the screen has been going blank and I have to exit out. Bummed and kinda annoying when you‚Äôre wanting to look through advice and comments and it glitches out."

I live in the US with my husband far from my mom and mother in law. And we have time difference with our home country. So when I need to find answer to any disturbing me question, Baby Center helps me without having to search a lot. And every week I get detailed info about my baby‚Äôs progress. Love it and recommend it to every woman. Thanks"
432,432,5,2018-10-11T22:42:10.000Z,malumiya,So thankful!,"Since I downloaded this app during my pregnancy, I couldn‚Äôt be happier. All the articles, videos and tips were on point, and made me feel very comfortable, calm and integrated. Now my baby is 2 weeks old, and still, I often read everything out there related to what my baby and myself are going through at this moment. For every doubt I have, I always find an answer from Baby center. I am just very thankful!!"

I checked it every week during pregnancy, and still do for newborn articles. I look forward to reading the articles based on my baby‚Äôs age. The app is user friendly, nicely designed and has little ads. It has helpful articles, tools and forums. I recommend it to anyone expecting or with a newborn. Thank you for everything, keep up the great work!"
434,434,5,2019-04-01T13:07:09.000Z,GoddessSunshine,Love the updates and extra information,I have only been using the app for about a two weeks. Thus far it has been great! BabyCenter updates me with the size and growth of my little one every week and they also provide me with information about what‚Äôs healthy to eat and other do‚Äôs and don‚Äôt while pregnant. There are other perks that I have not taken advantage of yet but as time goes by I will. Thank you for creating this app.
435,435,5,2020-11-12T14:49:19.000Z,mirrame23,2nd time using and I love it,This is my second pregnancy I‚Äôve tracked with this app and it love it. I still have access to the post I made from my last pregnancy 6 years ago and it‚Äôs nice being able to look back on my symptoms and feelings and compare them to this pregnancy. The app sends me notifications each week with my weekly baby update or small tips for my stage in pregnancy. I have no complaints. I think you‚Äôll enjoy this app.

She miscarried right directly prior to this pregnancy. The name she hoped for was wonderful. This time She gave it the name œÑŒ≠œÅŒ±œÇ which is Greek for monster! LOL I guess to survive we must find humor! But I enjoy following along on all the size changes and I nick name it that weeks size! It‚Äôs been to long for me to remember all the details and she is 27 and new to this!
437,437,4,2020-12-20T15:23:04.000Z,Amercado98,Great App,"Awesome app. Tells you affordable and high end options of baby care products. Has posts from other and all types of women on what they‚Äôre going through that makes gives you a kind of comforting feeling if you‚Äôre a first time mom and not sure about what‚Äôs happening to your body/if something is normal. It would always tell me a weight that was wayyyyyy lower than my son, and I didn‚Äôt like that, but no ultrasound is 100% on fetus weight either so it really didn‚Äôt bother me that much."
438,438,5,2020-03-30T18:19:13.000Z,Bartsimpsonsshorts,Love it!,BabyCenter app made me change my mind about baby apps! It kept me informed about everything going on in every trimester and reassuring me the whole way through. I really loved the small jokes made in the app as well! It made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt reading plain ol‚Äô information but made me excited to be pregnant and learn about the cute and exciting things about being a mom! The polls involving other mommy‚Äôs to be was cute and fun. I definitely recommend this app!
439,439,1,2020-06-05T02:59:29.000Z,Riley1796,Isn‚Äôt this supposed to be about pregnancy?,"If anyone wants a baby app that is about PREGNANCY and not politics and race, PREGNANCY+ Is the baby app you need!! It‚Äôs sooo much better than this crap!! I liked this app when I first got it. I didn‚Äôt know it was gonna be used as a platform for politics and what‚Äôs going on in the world. I thought it was supposed to be all about pregnancy. I‚Äôm disappointed. Everywhere I look I see news stories and ads about racism and what‚Äôs going on in the world I didn‚Äôt need a baby app to shove all the negativity into my face too. I came on this app to find something positive to look forward to, my baby. My pregnancy. Thanks for being another news platform baby center."

Does not always show the current date of the week. Always need to adjust my due date then Input it right back to get the accurate day of the week"
441,441,1,2019-01-16T11:53:11.000Z,jtaylor1987,Disappointed,"I loved this app at first, we took a bumpie starting at 5 weeks so we could document the beautiful change in me. Word of caution!!! If you get a new phone or your iPhone accidentally deletes your apps like they like to do all of your bumpie pictures will be gone!! I lost my whole first trimester of pictures and I am devastated. I emailed customer service and said if you get a new phone or the app is deleted your pics will be gone unless you have backed them up. Please back them up to your camera roll. I can‚Äôt get them back. I don‚Äôt understand why they won‚Äôt stay, even the baby names I saved are there but not the pics. So disappointed that they do this."

It updates you daily with insightful articles and tips to help you along your pregnancy. I had my husband download the app and he gets all the updates I do, so he is on the same page as me on learning everything we need to know before the baby comes. This is an excellent app that is easy to navigate and I highly recommend to anyone!"

I highly recommend this app to all mom's. Offering everything from charts of detailed time logs that include feeding(breast or bottle), sleep, and diapers to meds, and even milestones. It's absolutely amazing! I love being able to present my pediatrician with detailed facts. Thank you to the creators and people behind the creation of such a valuable tool for any parent!"

We are currently living in Italy and so it helped me bypass cultural norms to do what I thought was best without having the doubt about my ""strange"" ways. Because the doctor and pediatrician visits are in Italian this app also helped me know what to expect. I recommend it to all my expecting friends! The only thing I wish it had is the language availability in Italian too."

This one looks at changes with mom, baby and the whole process. I love the ability to capture pictures of baby during the many stages of pregnancy. It‚Äôs really helpful in terms of connecting with baby in the womb. I appreciate the clean and non cumbersome esthetics of the website as well. This is a message from an aspiring father, married to an expectant mother. Thank You."

I‚Äôve learned so much about my babies development with this app. I loved how the app told me how big my baby was in my belly. It is so helpful with many subjects that nobody really talks about but are still important. I love this app and will most likely use it for any other pregnancy in the future and will definitely recommend! 10/10

It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if moderators weren‚Äôt quick to declare a pro-life comment as a community violation whereas comments encouraging a woman who was considering aborting her baby (because the baby MAY have Down syndrome) that she should think of her other kids and not put that strain on her family is somehow perfectly acceptable on here. Really, it‚Äôs just kind of sickening."
450,450,5,2017-10-03T15:23:06.000Z,Skylynn Szot,Love this app,Wish they would tell you how many months you are. I like knowing how many days you have left and weeks but it makes your time being pregnant seem so much longer. I do love this app. I like seeing how big the baby is and watching the videos. when it comes time to delete the app I will cry. It makes the end of pregnancy for real. Having the baby makes it real but this app is a big part of your pregnancy.

Love how the site gives you to-do lists, what's safe for pregnancy, registry, what you need during the pregnancy and after. I also LOVE the bumpie. Definitely using that as I advance in my pregnancy. Has answered all of my questions and allows me to look ahead to future weeks and see what lies ahead. Highly recommended!"

This app had me soooooo ready to meet this little guy and he was everything I hoped for and more.

After I had my baby I didn‚Äôt realize that the app would still give me information month by month about all my babies milestones. I absolutely recommend this.

I hope other new moms can discover this app, it is truly very helpful. They also include birth class videos, inform you on what you need to know if you‚Äôre scared."

Then when they do and I hit done immediately, it plays the music in the background. Also, when I rewind to the beginning after listening to an ad, it replays the ad. The app also asks you to log in if the app is already open on your phone. So you have to go to your task manager and close it or open it from there. I just ‚Äúclear all‚Äù and then it wont ask you to log in if you reopen it."

So after trying many, many times I will click the reset password link and when I click on the email it sends, it just takes me back to the same log in page on the app so I can‚Äôt create a new password.

You can do so many things with this app you can snap your baby bumps. It‚Äôs so cool it has baby name ideas just really helpful all the way around I love it !! I would recommend this to anyone especially for your first pregnancy!! üëçüèæüôÇüôÉüòâ."
471,471,5,2018-09-05T04:30:25.000Z,03Jenna03,Love this app!,"I have been using this app since I got pregnant with my first son back in 2013. I have used it with each one of my pregnancies and continue to use it at my babies grow! Love all the information/advice you find with this app! Definitely would recommend downloading it, or using their website if you are trying to pregnant, planning to become pregnant or would like to track your baby‚Äôs growth once their born!"
472,472,5,2020-10-08T22:07:12.000Z,RebyBoyer,Love this app,"From thinking of having a baby to the magic to conceiving, this app has everything! I love my groups and how open everyone is, and it‚Äôs so comforting that dads are welcome too! The medical information available helps me understand what‚Äôs happening to my body as I reach the perfect 9 month home for my new family member! It‚Äôs seriously a must have for parents starting out or a new couple learning more about themselves!"
473,473,5,2020-04-20T13:57:41.000Z,Lauren1088,Tracking Pregnancy with BabyCenter,"The BabyCenter app was the first app I downloaded after I learned I was pregnant. I wasn‚Äôt previously aware of BabyCenter but a quick search brought it to my attention. I‚Äôve found their articles very informative and timely. I‚Äôve learned a lot during the earliest weeks of my pregnancy and have found comfort in the consistent and thoughtful articles, tips, and BabyCenter community. Overall, I highly recommend!"
474,474,5,2020-02-15T21:31:19.000Z,LeylaRodriguez,Great App!,"This app is perfect when you‚Äôre pregnant and postpartum! While you‚Äôre pregnant, it shows you the develop throughout each stage. When you give birth it switches and provides information about breastfeeding and bottle/formula feeding. Breastfeeding stories. Things you should do at certain stages, like tummy time! This answers a lot of great questions and concerns for the baby. I absolutely love this app. Especially keeping track of everything."
475,475,1,2020-01-11T15:09:50.000Z,mommabear1995,Stop,"Don‚Äôt get this app its supposed to be an app you can go for to ask advice &talk to people but everyone is so negative childish & disrespectful it‚Äôs ridiculous. Literally deleted app off my phone because of it I‚Äôve asked to take my profile down but they refuse to & say I have to do it myself but doesn‚Äôt let me or they don‚Äôt give me instructions on how to do so, so I just deleted it. Giving a bad review & won‚Äôt be using this app anymore go with another one probably better off"
476,476,2,2019-12-08T17:08:11.000Z,Dexlion,Needs work,"While this app is great to keep you up to date on your baby‚Äôs development, it is the little things that ruin it. I‚Äôm constantly having to sign in as the app doesn‚Äôt keep my information like it should. There are a lot of videos that hold information that I may need but since there are no captions, I‚Äôll never know. Not hearing impaired friendly at all. Ads play automatically, dominating the screen and blasting sound out of the speakers when I‚Äôm using a white noise app and my baby wakes up. I can‚Äôt browse the app when my baby is asleep and that is the only time I have to browse."
477,477,5,2021-07-17T16:57:38.000Z,great infor,Great visualization info,"I used that for my first son in 2014 and now I am using it again for my second pregnancy, the app is much more convenient before I used to only get weekly emails not as fun as the app, the information is very valuable to me, and my son really excited when I show him the size and pictures every week. Very important to me he understands the process, it is the best way to help him pictures the baby growth."
478,478,5,2021-03-17T01:00:05.000Z,EstellitaCelina,This app is extremely helpful and amazing!!!,Update: this is my 3rd pregnancy and I‚Äôve used this app for them all! I love it & find it slightly better and more informative than other apps.
479,479,5,2020-12-17T16:08:12.000Z,mugglemamanora,Convenient and timely,"Heard about BabyCenter from a friend and I love it. It couldn‚Äôt be easier to get the information I need exactly when I need it. I used/use it with my firstborn‚Äîwho is now 3‚Äìand with my 6-month-old. I‚Äôve used BabyCenter primarily to track my pregnancy and my children‚Äôs growth, in addition for reviews on strollers and car seats and other equipment. The articles and videos are short but still somehow cover all the bases."
480,480,5,2018-05-10T19:56:22.000Z,Baby Smith 2018,Amazing!,"This app is so helpful. I love the little updates they give about how your baby is progressing each week and all sorts of fact and myths of pregnancy. Even if there isn‚Äôt something directly on the app page you can search things in the search bar and it will send you to another page with multiple listings of answers! This is my first pregnancy, so I‚Äôve been googling everything under the sunüíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòä"
481,481,5,2018-07-11T23:06:28.000Z,nay.del12,Great App!!,I started using baby center the second I found out I was pregnant and I feel in love with it the second I opened the app. From telling me the size of my unborn baby to all the informative information it has for you weekly and what to expect etc. I really enjoyed this app throughout my pregnancy and even now that my child is a month old. I found it very useful and definitely recommended it to both moms and dads.
482,482,5,2018-10-18T12:25:26.000Z,jovanshayallen,I highly recommend this app !!!,I‚Äôve had this app since the beginning of my pregnancy and it was great with tips and teaching me a lot of things i didn‚Äôt know as I become a first time mom . My baby is now 4 months today and I still uses this app it has a lot of great features like updating on how many months/weeks my baby is and letting me keep tract of her weight ect. I recommend this especially to all first time moms !!!
483,483,5,2018-10-31T17:01:18.000Z,BleedingGreen47,Awesome,I don‚Äôt write reviews unless I love something or I hate it. I love this app! I love the fruit references and the day to day updates on the baby‚Äôs growth. The forums are good too to connect with others that are just as far along as you and have the same issues you do! I love the articles on lifestyle choices and other pregnancy related topics. It also has a lot of other good tools like baby name suggestions. Definitely recommend to any mom or dad!
484,484,5,2020-11-18T21:56:08.000Z,AuroraWalla,The best guiding app for pregnancy I‚Äôve found and it‚Äôs free!,"I love the short videos describing how far along you are, what to expect, etc. recent update rolled out making it more user friendly and pretty to use!"
485,485,5,2020-11-15T21:21:00.000Z,2Andrea7,Love this app!,Being a mom to 2 kids can be hard especially if there a bit of a gap between them because things are constantly changing. This app has helped me with my firstborn and now my second born. There are tons of things that I didn‚Äôt learn the first time around or didn‚Äôt know that needed to do because babies are different. This app is great. I can always find whatever I have a question on in here.
486,486,5,2019-12-07T02:06:15.000Z,CynthiaOh,The best app for Pregnancy,"I love the bumpie photo gallery where I can keep track of my growing belly each week. Every week your baby is compared to the size of a vegetable or a fruit in the bumpie gallery. This app is fun and also has great articles to read that correlate to your specific week. Articles range from prenatal vitamins, what foods to eat each week, work outs & much more!  I definitely used this app more than the typical ‚Äúexpected‚Äù app. GREAT JOB!"
487,487,5,2021-08-08T16:59:07.000Z,Meow1986,Babycenter,This app offers a lot of important information on a variety of subjects that are vital for mothers to aid and guide in taking care of their new baby. I‚Äôm on my third baby and it‚Äôs still helpful to review the information. Having a newborn baby is never easy no matter how many times you‚Äôve done it. Having information on hand to help you know what‚Äôs normal and what to expect along with tips and solutions is so reassuring.
488,488,4,2021-08-24T20:55:39.000Z,JessicaG84,Great way to track while pregnant but not helpful after birth,I loved this app the whole time through two pregnancies but that‚Äôs all. After baby is born it really has no function. You go to the tools thinking they are actually function tools and all it is is helpful tips or articles. This app would be way better if you could use the tools to actually enter in weights and heights at every well child. Or track your feedings would be amazingly helpful.
489,489,5,2021-06-16T13:48:14.000Z,Lia Kamila,Part of the family,"I love using baby center. My first pregnancy, I hopped around different apps that were pretty good, until I stumbled across BabyCenter! It really helped me keep track, learn new things with being pregnant for the first time, a mommy to a new born for the first time. Giving me tips and super helpful videos with each milestone in my pregnancy. I am now pregnant with my second child and it was a no brainer to use BabyCenter again! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
490,490,4,2018-08-04T16:10:12.000Z,Seguzman,Awesome!,Amazing way to keep track and see how others are dealing with their pregnancy. I‚Äôm a first time father with a first time mother and learned a lot! I enjoyed being able to track far beyond our current status and look at future symptoms she will have so we are not caught off guard. The only thing that would give it five stars to me is a live chat option with actual OBs or Nurses when questions arise. Thankfully my wife and I had the option for an on call nurse at our hospital.
491,491,5,2018-09-30T20:19:20.000Z,iamaertens,Wonderful,"Through both of my pregnancies one of my favorite things was getting weekly updates about my baby‚Äôs growth. Very informative with helpful tips and tricks for the many different symptoms and changes that come with pregnancy. My two and a half year old son also loved watching the videos and seeing where ‚Äúbaby sister‚Äù was at in her development. Thanks for being a joyful part of welcoming my babies, BabyCenter!"
492,492,5,2018-12-07T14:10:30.000Z,BoyMamaForever,Best App!,"I used this app every week! It‚Äôs one of the best. My top 2 for sure. I only wish they went on to the toddler years, at least until age 2. I know I can go to the normal site, but having it on the app would be amazing! Anyway- this app helps me through my pregnancy and 1 st year with my 3rd child, and when you are starting all over again at age 38 this was very needed! So much has changed since I had my 17 and 14 year old."
493,493,5,2019-01-20T03:42:39.000Z,Saraaawrrr,First time mom,This app along with what to expect when expecting helped during my first pregnancy giving me reality checked on being a first time mom. I actually learned most of what I know now from these apps rather than from my obgyn that‚Äôs how terrible they were lol this app helped me with what questions to ask my doctor ect. Because they do not tell or explain anything unless you ask specific questions
494,494,5,2019-06-05T13:48:57.000Z,Harmony Rain,A bittersweet app,"I love this app for many reasons and hate it for one! It‚Äôs soooo full of amazing articles and videos to keep you informed on your little one growing within BUT they get me too anxious the closer I get to giving birth! It‚Äôs such a cool thing to have a count down unless you‚Äôre like me and am so scared to go through the process of birth. Overall, my favorite app. I visit it everyday if not once then at least a couple of times a day!!"
495,495,5,2021-01-12T23:54:05.000Z,Laciebandz,I love this app!!,"I downloaded this app while I was pregnant and still have it after birth. It is was of the most accurate and informing apps for first times moms such as me who wants to know everything they can about their babies. I love that it notifies me every week about my baby  development and it‚Äôs always correct about what‚Äôs going on. If you‚Äôre  wanting to download this app, go ahead you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
496,496,1,2021-06-01T22:53:14.000Z,MamaJaaade,Not working.,"Just downloaded the app again. Had it with my first born and 4 years later (which is now) I tried downloading again but it won‚Äôt go past the ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre personalizing your daily tips‚Äù screen. It won‚Äôt load all the way. I closed the app and tried again, tried on WiFi, turned off my phone and tried again and still doesn‚Äôt go past that screen. Disappointed so I‚Äôm just going to uninstall and use a different app I guess. Was excited to use the same app I did with my first baby and sad that it‚Äôs not working for me."
497,497,5,2020-12-03T02:21:27.000Z,CofO13,Love this app!,"I really wanted to find something that not only shows how baby is progressing but what your body was doing through it all. This app definitely does that and it‚Äôs super fun to see how it all works and helps you to better understand what your body is going through. It also connects you with a group on Facebook of other mothers for advice, encouragement, etc. I would definitely recommend!"
498,498,5,2020-11-28T00:46:20.000Z,Mimstoanend,Great Information,I can only rate what I have used. I have enjoyed the timely articles and reading my weekly updates. The content is very relevant and I feel it adds to my prep for this baby.
499,499,5,2019-09-15T02:19:27.000Z,LilyBK8,New mom,I have to say that as much as I try to do the right thing I always think I am wrong.  But baby center always has a great read or article that assures me I have done something right and gives me more tips. I love this app.  It‚Äôs puts my mind at ease especially when I get overwhelmed listening to soooo much advice from others.  This app lets me do it my way and guides me to what I feel is best for my baby (and my gut instinct). Thank you !
500,500,5,2017-09-19T22:39:41.000Z,Isgoodapptowaist time,First time mom,"I'm a first time mom, I spend my day reading articles but most group questions from other moms that are close to my questions. It's nice getting advice and answers from moms who have gone through what I'm living. This week I was put on bed rest due with a cerclage due to a short cervix and I can't tell y'all enough how this app has help me. So many advice and inspiration from moms it's amazing. I feel like I have a full support."
501,501,4,2017-11-27T12:36:13.000Z,Britt FTM,Excellent app!,"This app helped me everyday throughout my pregnancy, I loved the little reminders of how far along I was throughout my pregnancy, I found myself excited to open to help and learn some new information about my growing bundle of joy. It still could have some improvements, such as keeping the exact progress of pregnancy as you skim through the app. But it always showed you your exact weeks when you reopened the app, hopefully I expressed that correctly. Still a superb app !"
502,502,5,2018-02-15T01:53:59.000Z,Ivy and Frank,First time parents,Me and my husband are grateful for this app because it provided us insight about our growing baby and the information we need to know about the right care.
503,503,5,2018-05-10T09:58:53.000Z,gibblets215,Great app for first time moms,"Being a first time mom, and now finishing up my second trimester, this app has given me the chance to learn things I didn‚Äôt know. It has also given me a sense of closeness with my little one as I get to learn about her development weekly. I love knowing how she is doing in there, how big she is, and what she looks like throughout the 9 months. I‚Äôll continue to sing the praises of this app and encourage you to check it out!"
504,504,5,2018-05-28T23:34:27.000Z,NaveenShrimal,Whole world of information,"This is the best app out of all the other that I have been using.. the only thing I don‚Äôt like about this app is its user interface, other app that I have been using was surely the better if we compare the usability. But who cares for that when you get better and vast source of information with babycenter. Till now I never had a question whose answer is not available with babycenterüòÅ"
505,505,5,2018-06-05T23:23:49.000Z,Witrago19,Best app compared to others,"Best app ever, you honestly know what to expect during your pregnancy and also when your baby is born! It lets you know what to expect during every month of pregnancy and also when your baby is finally born you know wheat to expect for every milestone. Best app. Used many other apps and this one is the best. Plus if you have any questions it literally has the answers for everything in regards."
506,506,5,2021-08-06T20:02:52.000Z,ashGodd,Informative,"I love reading the updates each week to see how baby is growing, developing and what‚Äôs going on with other my body! Sometimes it even reminds me I‚Äôm a week further along when it‚Äôs slipped my mind! :-D Like to see all the information given, like projected length and weight of baby to compare to my OB scans. Really enjoying this app while growing my third baby and never have a problem with it functioning."
507,507,5,2021-06-25T08:41:30.000Z,Lexy Jeffries,I Love BabyCenter ü§ç,"I am currently 35 weeks and i‚Äôve used this app since day one. It is always fun to hop on and track my milestones as I progress through my pregnancy. I love the little info bullets, they are always so accurate according to what I‚Äôm feeling each week. That is something that is really reassuring especially when it‚Äôs your first. The app is very easy to use and really informative. Would definitely recommend!"
508,508,5,2020-12-29T14:06:28.000Z,routhie,My favorite one stop app,I have like 3 baby app but this one is my favorite. While I was pregnant it did all the updates on how big baby is etc as soon as I had my son (put in the app that I had him) it switched to tracking baby‚Äôs development & showing what milestones are typical for age. It has mom groups and so much more. It‚Äôs literally a one stop app. I don‚Äôt even use my other app because this has everything I need.
509,509,5,2020-11-17T05:19:15.000Z,Nickybueso,The best app for pregnancy and after pregnancy.,It‚Äôs such a good app for you too follow during your pregnancy and its algo good after you have you baby. You can see how your belly and baby develops and also when he/she is already born. They give you so many tips and you can find almost everything related to you belly or baby. Very good app! I loved it with my first pregnancy and I‚Äôm still using it now that my baby is almost 4 months.
510,510,5,2019-01-17T13:13:30.000Z,Saritagilbertson,The Best,"There is no there is no other baby and pregnancy tracker app out there. It helps you through every single stage in life covers over what seems like hundreds of topics. It does not bother you by asking if you would like to pay money to upgrade for more access and abilities. It seriously helped me through my twin pregnancy. Although the baby tracker portion is amazing, it would be nice to have the app be accessible to mothers of multiples."
511,511,4,2019-03-21T14:09:23.000Z,DaeAry23,Cute and informative,"Fun app that keep you updated on some baby things that are happening and has a great community to ask questions. Over half the time I google something, a Babycenter response comes up. My only quip is that the pictures of the woman‚Äôs pregnant body, doesn‚Äôt look like she‚Äôs pregnant and I think it looks weird. The pictures in What to Expect When You‚Äôre Expecting are much more realistic and helps when it‚Äôs comes to ‚Äúhow should my body be looking‚Äù"
512,512,5,2020-07-04T18:42:00.000Z,MomPikachu,Nothing but amazing!,"I have been here thrice. It is an amazing app. Importantly the experiences shared by ladies going through same process as yours is beyond exceptional. It has helped me navigate the process when I was first time pregnant, second time when I had an unfortunate miscarriage, and third time when I was carrying high risk pregnancy. In each pregnancy the community support and tips has helped me immensely. I highly recommend this to new and to experienced moms."
513,513,2,2020-09-22T23:47:48.000Z,nikkimoore89,"Info is great, community is terrible","Don‚Äôt join birth clubs or groups‚Äîas a 4th time mom, I‚Äôve never been in a group that has been positive. They‚Äôre all judgy, toxic man-haters that will suggest you divorce or leave your partner over every little thing (ex. Someone asked for meal ideas for their picky kids and husband and people started attacking the husband for being a ‚Äúman-child‚Äù and the whole thread became about that). In my experience, usually the group owners are the most vocal and worst about it, so it is not the safe, supportive space pregnant women need. The info is great, but you can get that from a google search without the drama."
514,514,5,2020-07-03T00:11:23.000Z,fardosapisces21,Baby center,Absolutely love this app!! I've been using it since I found out I was pregnant and now my daughter is 7 months old! I found it amazing that the app was telling me how big my baby was when she was growing in my stomach step by step what to expect and now it still telling me week by week what to expect from my baby. It's just absolutely an amazing and anyone that's becoming a new parent this is the app for you!!
515,515,5,2020-06-16T14:13:05.000Z,Kaylor Miles,Best baby app EVER ü¶ã,"I have been using this app since I found out was pregnant with my now four year old back in 2015. Very informative, literally always head on with the updates, you can join other mommies in groups, have discussions, asks questions that you feel are not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but they really are lol , all my mommies knows exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. Overall this app is simply amazing, would give it ten stars if I could!!"
516,516,5,2020-06-10T02:27:44.000Z,mtrajabi,Nice,"A compationate companion! Great especially for a first mom to be, and till now, that my daughter is 6 months old."
517,517,5,2020-05-19T12:17:03.000Z,Emsanti05,Great App and customer service!,"I used this to follow my entire pregnancy and the first few months of my daughter‚Äôs life. It was amazing, has great advice, useful tools and charts. There seems to be a glitch right now (as per my edited review) but it‚Äôs being worked on, so I am rating this app how I would have prior to this issue! I am so happy they‚Äôre fixing it because it has really given me a wonderful follow-along of my first pregnancy/baby!"
518,518,5,2019-07-24T15:44:20.000Z,khadijaz,An amazing app!,"This free application is very amazing, it's all what you need as a guide at home between your prenatal visits. It tells you everything about your baby on a weekly basis and it also gives you important information about what you should be doing right now. It gives you ideas about any opportunities you might be eligible for, for example: applying for a free breast pump. That's my first time to be pregnant and I really like this app! :)"
519,519,4,2020-05-12T22:03:26.000Z,SophieZ4,Awesome,"I love this app. My siblings are the ones who told me about it.  They loved using it. I love the baby size comparisons to the food, makes it easier to imagine. The videos of the growth of the baby are fantastic. All the articles are really helpful as well. I only give it four stars though because right now they don‚Äôt have a twin option and sometimes the app will shut down on me. But I still highly recommend this baby app compared to the others out there."
520,520,2,2017-11-16T22:43:07.000Z,Schmid b a c,Not worth it,"This app includes many articles, but they don‚Äôt give you articles on your feed that are necessarily relevant for the week you are in, although they seem to try. For example, when I was 12 weeks I got an article on ‚Äúflying tips‚Äù. I‚Äôm not even showing, and so I am perfectly comfortable on a flight. I was getting articles on maternity clothes from week 5!"
521,521,5,2018-04-14T14:00:02.000Z,@B2,Baby Center... My Guide,I downloaded the baby center app with my first child whose now 5yrs old. I like that I receive information about the age development. Especially the social emotional information. I just had my second child and I am on this every week. I love reading the growth updates and advice that other moms post on the site. I also love the search feature because I also find the information I need.
522,522,5,2018-06-18T16:20:22.000Z,AR1567,Helpful At Every Stage,"This app has helped me from the beginning of my pregnancy and even now that my baby is almost 5 months. For my pregnancy it went through each stage and had plenty of articles that answered all my questions. My husband and I were able to tract each stage of growth the fetus was in. Now that my baby is here, I am able to track every milestone my child should be reaching. I enjoy using this app."
523,523,4,2018-08-30T22:40:08.000Z,DeMarie_8,Trouble with the provided videos,Not a bad app I use it almost everyday to read new articles since I am a soon to be mother of my first child. But the videos provided never seem to work for me. I‚Äôm afraid if I delete and try again It‚Äôll mess up more...I‚Äôve read some of the reviews and that‚Äôs what happened to them I‚Äôll download another app along with keeping this one just in case but i would like to see the videos you provided as well....they seem really interesting!
524,524,4,2018-09-08T12:26:35.000Z,Mamabear Ina,Enjoy the Articles,Whether you are a new or seasoned parent checking out the articles can help to lead to forums where you can get any question answered.  I enjoy getting different points of view than what I might receive through family to make better educated decisions on what type of parent I am versus the parent I want to be.  I have signed both my children up so that I periodically get updates.  Then chose whether or not I want to read.  No pressure reading at my leisure.
525,525,5,2018-09-09T03:15:58.000Z,Power Recorder,Love this app!!,I have been using this app since I first found out I was pregnant. It has been a really valuable app in telling me what is happening every week from conception even past when my son was born. My son is almost 10 months old and it has been really valuable information keeping me updated as to what is coming up work possibly already be happening with my child. Highly recommend!

527,527,5,2021-05-25T22:29:13.000Z,Rue_28,Amazing app!!,"Love using this app! It keeps me posted on weekly changes to my body and my baby (which is important to me since I sometimes struggle to remember which week I‚Äôm in! #pregnancybrain) and provides wonderful information on a variety of potential concerns. Being a first-time mom, I really appreciate those informative pieces. Definitely love using this BabyCenter! Plan on using it again, if I have another little oneüòä"
528,528,5,2021-04-17T13:23:46.000Z,WordsWinnerMarie,Really good,"I have several pregnancy tracking apps. Baby center is the best (or at least tied with WTE.) The articles are always great and the discussion forums for your birth month are a really helpful feature for connecting with other mamas going through the exact same stages. I used baby center 14 years ago, back before apps were a thing, with my first child. I used to look forward to the emails back then!"
529,529,1,2021-03-15T09:12:48.000Z,Erikkax33,Trash,Update completely ruined the app and the tipping point that made me delete it was all the judgement. Some topics I get but something as simple as a name choice they will harass you for. It‚Äôs unbelievable this community is that toxic. I don‚Äôt know how this app is even still running. The rolled out the update to UK first and took no advice on it even though it was horrendous there too. So clearly shows the fact they have no care for their members. The group owners aren‚Äôt held accountable for their actions and will bully you along with other people. Just be careful app isn‚Äôt for sensitive people. Definitely not for conservative people either or anyone who goes against the grain.

It gives great useful information each trimester you are in and weekly updates of baby growth! I still use it to keep up with my baby‚Äôs milestones and the information provided is great!

532,532,5,2020-11-28T18:43:20.000Z,Starz_101,Awesome app,"I love how this app shows your babies progress as he grows older. They also have links to tips and advice. You also have a community of moms who you can ask opinions or advice from if you need it. It‚Äôs a pretty wholesome app that tracks your child‚Äôs milestones. I‚Äôm using it for my second baby now. I would definitely recommend using this when you‚Äôre pregnant and even after birth! Best part, it‚Äôs totally free!"

It‚Äôs crazy how sometimes the email is right ‚Äúon the nose‚Äù with what we were going through!  I don‚Äôt know how to get the email to say boy/he/his instead of referring to my child as a girl though?"

Baby Center is by far the best app!  I found everything I needed to know plus some during my pregnancy and now.  My son is a year old, about to be a year & a month on the fourth.

The information and pictures combined make the app easy to understand and easy to navigate through. She‚Äôs 9 weeks today and since the beginning we‚Äôve been learning a lot of pregnancy and the things we should look out for. Great app I‚Äôd suggest it to any couple out there looking to track the entire pregnancy.
537,537,5,2020-07-18T15:10:48.000Z,Cassnda,Absolutely love!,I love how the app keeps you updated not just on one thing but on multiple things. It lets you know how far along you are and the baby are. I appreciate how they even went ahead and got details on how the baby is growing week per week and also details on how the bump should be growing and symptoms the pregnant mom can be having. Its such a big help. I really recommend this app for anyone who is pregnant.
538,538,5,2020-06-22T09:14:37.000Z,Laydilex,Choose this one first,Most moms I know (especially first time) have more than one app. Just make sure this one is top on your list. The articles they provide have credible sources and aren‚Äôt just opinions from a group of moms. They aren‚Äôt trying to be trendy.
539,539,3,2020-06-23T16:38:45.000Z,RendiRoo,I love this app but it freezes a lot..,"I love this app and everything about it! However, it seems lately it freezes up and when I try to click on info about my baby‚Äôs growth and development for this week it won‚Äôt load. Also, when I edit my bump selfies every week it kicks me out of the app. If these issues were fixed then it would be 5 stars for sure. It didn‚Äôt used to do this to me so I‚Äôm not sure if it was an update or what. My app says it‚Äôs completely up to date so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on."

Will make the ‚Äúcapture‚Äù sound and immediately crash the app & therefore doesn‚Äôt save the pic you assumed was taken. If you use your phone camera and then upload the pic into the app, there is a weird black bar to the right of your picture that doesn‚Äôt go away with editing (I tried every angle). Very frustrated since this didn‚Äôt happen until around week 22 of my pregnancy (by then too far for me to use a different app since I wanted a consistent time-lapse)."

I also love being connected to other mothers. I cannot count the times I‚Äôve thought, ‚Äúis this normal?‚Äù Only to find another mother who ask the same question in a forum. Truly an indispensable app for any mother whether it be her first or surprise fifth!"
542,542,5,2018-05-29T13:33:32.000Z,anirbas96,SO ACCURATE!!!,"I tried so many other apps for pregnancy before this one, it was recommended to me by someone else. This is by FAR the most accurate! I can not tell you how many times I‚Äôd talk to my husband about something new that I felt or a new thing with our baby and when I would log on to the app BAM, it was describing these things. Currently using this app with my first baby! Will use and recommend this app always!"

544,544,5,2019-03-26T14:08:07.000Z,chantelüíï,LOVE!,I‚Äôve used baby center all throughout my pregnancy up until now my daughter is 6 months (which I absolutely love most baby apps end after your pregnancy baby center goes up to the first year). It‚Äôs the best baby app hands down there‚Äôs a whole community of other mommies you can reach out too and the little weekly/monthly updates are so fun to read to get to know what‚Äôs going on in your little babies world.
545,545,5,2019-11-28T03:57:47.000Z,this is dumb üëé,Changed my rating,"I can see BabyCenter changed some glitches on the app, I wrote a review with 2 stars complaining about how the app had too many adds and whenever a video would play an add would pop up and disrupt the video and once finished the babycenter video would never load and continue to play, but this doesn‚Äôt happen anymore so that‚Äôs cool :) thanks babycenter for improving your app! Love it! üíñ"

I was a new mom when I got the app so I liked learning new things that I already didn‚Äôt know from family, friends, and of course being aunt myself. It got my excited more and more each month! There‚Äôs so much on the app too, you can search anything you want which was helpful. I still use it now after my baby was born and she‚Äôs alittle over 2 months now ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

My son is not even 2yrs yet, so to still be learning after using it during his pregnancy, it is very informative. I even love the survey poles that allow me to see what majority of pregnant moms think concerning certain topics. Also the birthing club is a great community to chat with other mom-to-be who is due around the same time as you."
548,548,5,2019-06-29T00:09:35.000Z,katiel11,Super useful app!,"I loved this app during my pregnancy, especially being a first time mom. I always thought it was so cool that the articles each week were super helpful to answer the questions I had. I loved the weekly bump picture with size comparisons and I especially love the little video of all of them you get to make at the end of pregnancy. Now I use the app to track my sweet boy who‚Äôs almost 5 months old."
549,549,5,2019-06-13T05:07:40.000Z,Vidi7,Best App for expecting mothers and for 1st time moms!!,This app has been a lifesaver for me as a 1st time expecting mom. This app followed my day to day pregnancy progression and provided all the necessary information to help me understand everything that was occurring and that was to come. I have now given birth to a gorgeous baby girl and the app is now providing all the need to know on newborns. I absolutely love this app and will continue to use it daily. Thank you BabyCenter!
550,550,1,2017-10-08T22:14:14.000Z,@jmolicious_,Pointless,"This app let me down so bad. I created an account because you can't use it unless you do. So, great I utilized the ""bumpies"" and began to really like the app. Well my phone gave out and I thought ""well I'll lose everything but at least my bumpies and pregnancy memories will be saved in that app"" so I logged in on another device and what do you Know, they're all gone. So tell me WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING AN ACCOUNT IF IT DOESNT SAVE ANYTHING. So now here I am 30 weeks with a phone that no longer works and no photos of the past 30 weeks. If Instagram and Facebook have the capability of keeping everything no matter where you log in this app should've too. I'm heartbroken."

Loved using this app, as I wanted to avoid information overload and wanted to have as stress-free pregnancy as I could. Instead of ordering a ton of books or signing up for a million blogs, I used this app. Perfect for letting you know what things you may want to/need to research further. I was surprised at the timing of the symptoms and informational bits. They were right on point with what I was experiencing week-by-week."

All the info and suggestions are so helpful even to someone who has been through it all. Sometimes you think about calling the doctor for a small question but I‚Äôve found the info on the app and I don‚Äôt need to call the doctor and eating certain foods. My kids love checking the size of their In utero little brother! Oh the anticipation!!

554,554,5,2020-06-10T18:28:27.000Z,BellaNight07,Wonderful/Best app for all mom‚Äôs,I‚Äôve had this app for my first pregnancy. It was recommended to me by my OB and it is AWSOME!! You learn a lot about the process of your baby and the changes you are going through. You can even chat with mom‚Äôs who are also expecting and can ask them questions too. I am keeping this app for my next pregnancy. I really appreciate that this app helps us moms so much. Thank you üíØ fold to the creators of this app!!

Overall I do really like the app and the information it provides, but it is obviously (and for good reason) more centered on the mother and the mothers perspective. I wish there was more content that speaks to the fathers experience throughout the pregnancy, what they can be doing to help, etc."
556,556,5,2020-04-19T05:06:07.000Z,TwinningMommy,Love this app,"My twins are almost 6yrs old, this is my 2nd time around and I feel like a new soon to be mommy all over again. This app is very helpful with making sure you are staying on track with everything that you can think of or even things that you would‚Äôve never thought of and there is a huge community to help you with any questions, concerns or just there to support."
557,557,2,2020-05-15T01:48:05.000Z,Liliana_B,Updates ruined the experience,"The newest updates made the app difficult to navigate. It‚Äôs visually cluttered, not easy to find features anymore, and it is not intuitive at all. I also used to enjoy how the content was broken up into daily sections instead of by week, and the content didn‚Äôt used to be so repetitive. I used this app 4 years ago when I was pregnant with my daughter and have used it for 12 weeks for my current pregnancy, but the recent updates and lack of diverse content left me searching for a different app and I ended up deleting this one."
558,558,5,2020-02-09T14:13:49.000Z,wideouttech,Great app,Very informative!!! Lot‚Äôs of information and advice on what to do while pregnant. It keeps you up to date with how far long you are and shows you what going on during the growing process of your baby. I like the feature where you can take weekly pics of your belly! I would highly recommend this app.. it was recommended to me by the OB nurse. Hope you enjoy it as much as my husband and I do üòÄ
559,559,5,2019-12-11T20:02:59.000Z,jes_jay,Great App,"I love this app! It provides all the info a new mom needs without scaring the cr*p out of you like some of the other apps do. Many other apps had a ton of articles and pop-ups about miscarriages and rare diseases, etc. Every time I spent more than 5 minutes on them, I‚Äôd end up with a panic attack. But this app is enjoyable while still giving you all the important information you maybe looking for."
560,560,1,2018-05-31T12:24:12.000Z,EpikGlados,Eh,"The app has decent articles that aren‚Äôt updated enough and sometimes repeat, it‚Äôs awful to navigate, the members are awful, oh and once you make an account YOU CANT DELETE IT. Yeah that‚Äôs right you‚Äôre stuck in their system until the site dies off. There‚Äôs zero support and the groups are just cliques. Came here hoping to find someone to spend this pregnancy excited with and instead it made me feel like crap. Can‚Äôt even get my account taken down, don‚Äôt waste your time. ESPECIALLY if you‚Äôre a ftm looking for help because heaven forbid you ask the same question someone else already did that you didn‚Äôt see. Find a more supportive community."
561,561,5,2018-06-07T01:19:31.000Z,kathy46,Best app for soon to be mothers,"I, like most new moms, was super excited to see how my baby was growing and didn‚Äôt know what to expect. Baby center really payed out the most common journeys babies go through and have tips such as questions about injuries/illnesses, tips on how to put the baby to sleep, foods for them, and so much more. I would recommend this to everyone. My daughter is a toddler now but I still go back if I need more guidance."
562,562,4,2018-06-07T13:04:32.000Z,ENC2431,Baby Center App Review,I got this when I became pregnant with our first child and loved seeing the weekly progress of my growing baby. I also really liked the polls and being able to relate different aspects of my pregnancies with others. My only complaint is that I have to set it to 1 child or the other- I think they should make it easier and quicker to view each child- like maybe in tab form at the top and you can click between each.
563,563,3,2018-10-31T15:07:15.000Z,Lmgamboa225,Constantly logs me out.. what happened to this app?,"I‚Äôve used this app for the past 6 years and currently on my third pregnancy. This time around, I‚Äôm randomly logged out half the time I open the app on my phone. I don‚Äôt wanna have to enter my email and password every time I wanna use it. The weird part is sometimes I‚Äôll open it even after not logging in previous times and I‚Äôll be logged in. I really enjoy this app but this glitch alone is making me not even want to use it right now. I hope this gets fixed."
564,564,5,2019-03-21T20:08:24.000Z,linguisticarts,Have used this my last two pregnancies and just love it,"Love getting updates every week. Makes me excited to learn what‚Äôs happening every week. How my baby is changing, what to expect with my body. I have to say it tells me what‚Äôs going on with me about a week in advance which is a shocker lol. Really cool tool for 1st time parents or experienced parents. This is my last pregnancy but, i‚Äôd recommend this tool to everyone!"
565,565,5,2019-05-27T08:23:26.000Z,AKemp97,Helpful for a first-time momüëç,"Great app for a first time mother! This and ‚ÄúWhat to Expect When You‚Äôre Expecting‚Äù have been my Bible. I‚Äôm not the type to leave reviews online, but I have been thoroughly impressed with all of the options this app has! It gives health tips for me and baby, a weekly tracker to know exactly what‚Äôs going on with baby, help with baby names, interesting articles - an expecting mother couldn‚Äôt ask for more!"
566,566,5,2019-07-04T14:04:41.000Z,CFYVand,Love this app!,"I love the articles, pictures, and the community. I like the fact that I‚Äôm encouraged to start my own conversation thread and the ladies are so positive, caring, and supportive. Recommendation? I recommend a 3D view of the baby at each stage instead of still photo that I can only zoom in on. I use the pregnancy+ app for a better view of baby progression and I can do a 360 rotation there. Otherwise, the community def makes up for it!"
567,567,1,2019-11-24T07:26:27.000Z,bunnybearrawr,GET READY FOR THE BULLYING,This app is great for everything BUT the groups. In the groups you will have so many problems. People in the group feel empowered by their anonymity they feel it‚Äôs alright to gas light the crap out of an actual genuine question then continue to make personal attacks over and over and over. If your looking for groups that are helpful there‚Äôs a handful of them. The rest are like reliving high school if you were ‚Äúthe one kid left out‚Äù or bullied to crap. Honestly for first time moms I‚Äôd say use this app for everything else besides the boards and groups if you join a group I pray you get in one that‚Äôs actually helpful and not vile and full of hatred.
568,568,5,2019-07-03T19:22:20.000Z,Champlakers1,Love this app,"Since my wife and I found out that we were pregnant, I have been tracking the baby‚Äôs growth and my wife‚Äôs body changes through this app. This app is wonderful. It prepares newly to be parents. My wife‚Äôs body has gone through some changes and we always look at the app to see if its to be expected. We use the app and our doctors as guides. I have recommended this app to friends and family."
569,569,5,2019-06-29T01:26:38.000Z,Crazyonbox,So Positive and Helpful,This app has amazing videos and articles to help educate you throughout pregnancy as well as a huge community of wonderful ladies that are all in it with you. I‚Äôve had this app for about a month now and I‚Äôve never had social media that actually positively influenced my life but this does. I‚Äôve learned so much great information so far and feel much more comfortable going into being a first time mom.

She is currently 6 month old going on 16 lol but BabyCenter has prepared me for my active baby. I hope this helps!"

I‚Äôve met other mommies on this app that has helped answer any questions I had and I‚Äôve got to read about their pregnancy‚Äôs. This app also let me make a birthday plan before and after birth witch I‚Äôve tried others apps and this one is by far my favorite.
575,575,5,2021-05-10T15:53:24.000Z,morganalvarado,Great App,"This app really helped me with my first child. I had my son during the COVID pandemic, and we didn‚Äôt allow anyone to meet him until he was about 4 months old. As a first time mom, usually you have family and experienced mothers around to give advice. I didn‚Äôt have that option, but Baby Center has been very educational and helped me understand my baby‚Äôs needs and what milestones to work towards."

578,578,1,2020-02-17T19:33:43.000Z,Shundreca,Mostly bad but have some good resources,When it comes to tracking pregnancy and weeks its okay. My tracker is off but it shows me good examples of development. Now the groups are horrible. As others mentioned the cyber bullying is bad. That doesn‚Äôt bother me it‚Äôs after so many responses the close the whole thread no matter if everyone is respectable or not. I posted something and went to sleep and my thread was closed before I could respond. It said closed for evaluation they never reopened it. Once you get too many responses they close it because of all the attention its getting. I like the GLOW better because they do not do this. It is very underrated.

As a first time expecting mom there‚Äôs a lot of things that I didn‚Äôt know about pregnancy and so I started reading and searching to become more knowledgable about myself and my growing baby and I must say that this app is one of the things you should get once you found out your pregnant or even if you‚Äôre not and planning to conceive soon. üíï
582,582,5,2018-04-28T22:16:34.000Z,Pinkztar,Just love this app,"I loved it from the minute I downloaded it. Being a first time time I search for advice and is nice to know that this is a credible app where I receive updates, suggestions, reviews and many more things on a regular basis. It tells me where approximately my child should be as far as development, what to expect on the next doctor visit, from feedings to stools changing. Is a great app and I always recommended."
583,583,5,2018-09-01T18:25:56.000Z,AUBD0G,So encouraging,Becoming pregnant isn‚Äôt always just a joy filled occasion. Sometimes it‚Äôs scary and difficult to navigate and too easy to isolate.
584,584,5,2018-12-02T14:46:08.000Z,Yami moretti 57,Everything you need to know,"Baby center is very informative about your pregnancy. Step by step, week by week you get updates about your body and your growing baby. There were some things I thought I knew already but then baby center had a few other things to let me know. I am currently having my second child now and still using baby center for info."
585,585,5,2019-08-16T21:23:08.000Z,Ma'Ray,I love this app,I experienced 16 years of secondary Infertility and Baby Center has seen me through those years! Any questions I had I was able to research them on baby Center! Trying to  conceive is hard but having a app to be with you in all phases of conception makes things a little easier! I
586,586,5,2019-07-05T07:32:30.000Z,GASims75,Most informative.,"Becoming a first-time father at 43, I was most impressed with the extensive information and articles that not only encouraged me, but equipped me to be a more supportive husband during my wife‚Äôs pregnancy and understanding the growth of our baby."
587,587,5,2019-06-21T18:11:25.000Z,Boozin Suzan,Love all the articles!,"I love all the articles about anything and everything baby related. I also love that they track how far along you are and will send articles and information that match up with where you are pregnancy wise or child‚Äôs age. Lastly, I love that the app works with multiple children. So I still get info and updates on my older child along with updates on my pregnancy. Great app!"
588,588,5,2021-08-05T02:51:31.000Z,Neeski,Great Tool,"I downloaded this while pregnant to track how big my baby was each week. I was pleasantly surprised with all the details this app gave me. Each week it explained what was going on in my body and why as well as what symptoms to expect with their possible remedies. Now, I still use this app as it helps me gauge growth with my infant. It helps guide me with what my baby should be doing/learning. I highly recommend it."
589,589,5,2021-07-22T13:23:58.000Z,nvsbam,One tool for the whole pregnancy and postpartum,"Babycenter has been a reliable source of information for many moms and moms-to-be. All you need to know is in one app. Not too overwhelming, but enough information to awake you from all things a woman goes through during pregnancy. Thanks to its team and advocates; hope they keep up the good work in updating and maintaining the knowledge shared as moms are really relying on this app."

And you can see what your baby is developing each week and around the size it is!! An over all wonder app.
592,592,4,2021-04-24T21:40:22.000Z,Albyz88,Great Resource!,"The is an overall excellent resource for both pregnancy and post pregnancy. I loved the access to information and articles and other fun tools! The only improvement I would suggest is that the layout is sometimes confusing and it‚Äôs hard to get to the things I want to see. For example, I‚Äôll get an email with a snapshot of an article, but if I go into the app to look for it, the actual article can be really hard to find."
593,593,5,2021-03-23T10:42:07.000Z,Filledwithvim,Best of three!,"I downloaded three different apps after finding out I was pregnant. I haven't used many of the forums, but find the articles to be the most practical of the apps I have access to."
594,594,5,2021-03-23T04:51:10.000Z,rhedann,Perfect app for first time moms,I downloaded this app when I got pregnant with my first baby. It was perfect! Kept me up to date with things happening with my baby and connected me with other moms who were due at the same time as me! Any questions I had were answered by other moms who have been through the same things. Definitely recommend this app over all the other ones!
595,595,5,2020-12-02T03:14:48.000Z,bri1289,A must have,This app has seriously helped me as a new mom. Are use this app since the day I found out I was pregnant and it really prepared me for everything that I was about to go through for delivery as well as growing up with my child it‚Äôs nice to be able to chat with other moms and get their advice about what I may be going through.

597,597,5,2020-05-27T19:22:00.000Z,lancash1101,Love this app... it makes me a little less stressed!,"I loved getting the notification while I was pregnant and know how far along I was without even having to think about it. The app also tells you a lot about your baby and how it‚Äôs growing inside of you. Also after having my baby, it tells me how old he is. If you go to the app, it tells you what to expect from your kid at their age."
598,598,4,2020-10-04T17:27:41.000Z,MssWalker,It could be better but it‚Äôs the best one!,This app has been so helpful when it comes to informing us about our growing babe! I love the videos and helpful tips. The forums are great too. I use the tools in the app especially for my kick counts. But it‚Äôs a little disappointing when I‚Äôm having concerns about her movement and I start the timer but for whatever reason the app times out? And loses the record if there‚Äôs a bit of time in between kicks. Very frustrating!
599,599,5,2020-05-10T20:44:28.000Z,qdvickers,wish I knew about this app for my first baby!,I have really enjoyed this app! I‚Äôm only 9 weeks along and I totally wish I would‚Äôve known about this before my first baby. The app has a lot of good info and articles and videos that are relevant to where you‚Äôre at in your pregnancy. it‚Äôs also really fun to see about how big baby is at certain stages. can‚Äôt wait to use for the rest of my pregnancy.
600,600,4,2019-03-30T15:55:37.000Z,veeeejayyyy,"Good app, needs a few updates.",Its a good app. I wish they could alter the weekly updates based on your baby‚Äôs gender. I am having a girl and it seems like every week they give me facts about boys and also refer to my baby as he throughout the  article. Seems like this could be an easy fix and it would make the more personal.
601,601,5,2019-04-11T15:33:36.000Z,Teepah,Amazing App,"Being first time parents we have no idea what the hell we‚Äôre doing. This app has definitely made it easier to understand what‚Äôs going and what we can do to help ensure our baby is born healthy. You get daily updates on where your baby is on its growth based on the due date you enter. There‚Äôs also a sister app called baby names that is basically tinder for baby names, check it outü§üüèª"
602,602,5,2019-05-24T01:48:21.000Z,Schimm22,Such a helpful app !,"I‚Äôm a new mom so I‚Äôm cautious about everything and constantly googling everything and wondering what is good or bad for me and my baby. This app basically has all the answers to every question possible. If not, I‚Äôm able to ask other moms for assistance. I love the steps of each week and tells me the size of my baby and different articles to read at each stage. Best app hands down !!"
603,603,5,2020-04-28T14:25:15.000Z,ElisMama0921,This app is essential!,"This app has given me so much guidance as a first time mom! Not only did it let me know how much and in what way my baby was growing each week while I was pregnant, but it continues to do so by providing relevant and helpful articles each week about my son‚Äôs development and activities I can try with him. This is such a well put-together and beneficial app for anyone who has a baby or is pregnant!"
604,604,5,2020-04-26T14:04:37.000Z,lovesasha80,Such a great support,"I love this app. Even though I‚Äôm on baby number 2, I love reading the updates about the process and what steps he is in. My child would probably still be drinking milk only at 9 months. The app gave me tips on introducing foods, when they should be playing, smiling... and if they aren‚Äôt what to do as well! I recommend every mother whether it‚Äôs first time or second or third to use this a a general guide!!"
605,605,5,2020-02-15T23:33:48.000Z,Elena-elenik,Everything you need to know and more,"I‚Äôm so happy I can have an all inclusive baby app!  I am at my second child so my time is very limited. With my first one I had enough time to search for various resources and ideas, to go deep with my research on different topics. With this app I‚Äôm confident that I have valuable and credible information, delivered in a way that saves a lot of time ( the printable menu ideas for mom&baby is Awesome)."
606,606,5,2020-02-07T10:17:30.000Z,Natinatt,Best pregnancy app,Amazing app I love the votes the extra information as well as the classes and everything else they provide. I would recommend this to every expecting mom. They even have information about what to expect and milestones after your baby is born which is super helpful. This is my second pregnancy and I‚Äôm using the app again because I love how detailed they are with each week.
607,607,5,2019-07-29T12:59:38.000Z,ogfus,BabyCenter,"Literally the best to have during your pregnancy! So much information for you and your unborn child and even after giving birth. It‚Äôs been EXTREMELY helpful with all the questions, worries, and curiosity I have while carrying my child. Each and every day I‚Äôm on this site to read about my little nugget from how many weeks/days he or she is to the growth transformation during each week!!!"
608,608,4,2019-08-28T13:16:47.000Z,Paul Marc,Great info and resources,"BabyCenter has been my go-to for all four of my children since my firstborn 8 years ago. You get tips, hints and other news that makes you feel like you‚Äôre not alone out there in keeping little humans alive! The only fix I would suggest is to have more resources available for parents of multiples and preemies. Three of my four were premature and I have a set of twins. I noticed there isn‚Äôt a lot of info for these special circumstances."
609,609,5,2019-07-13T19:51:41.000Z,maritere2003,Perfect app for new moms...,I love this app... I used it during my pregnancy.. Its the perfect app to keep you updated in everything that is going on with your body in a weekly basis while you are expecting... specially if its your first pregnancy... all the tips that you get are unreal... and now that my baby is born I still using this app... I wish this app existed when I was pregnant with my other two kids... Specially with my first pregnancy...
610,610,5,2017-11-21T22:35:35.000Z,CrazyNoodles2.0,Best pregnancy and beyond app,This is by far the second best thing that has happened to me since my little one was conceived!! The app is full of detailed info and fun facts about your pregnancy. It made me feel so much connected to my baby even before he was born!! All the worries and anxieties and questions  related to pregnancy where mostly answered through this app. I love the beyond pregnancy app as well!! It grows as your little one grows!! Best app ever!!!
611,611,5,2018-02-08T01:44:09.000Z,soon to be momma T,First time mom,"I had no idea what to expect but this app has gone above and beyond. For a first time mom, I have books and friends and family, but taking a little bit in each day, getting to talk to women going through pregnancy at the same time as me and being able to track my little nugget has been so wonderful. Everything can be overwhelming but this app helps keep it simpleüíï"
612,612,5,2018-05-29T00:36:54.000Z,akelley29,First time mommy,"I‚Äôm a first time mom with so many questions and this app is full of useful information. (I didn‚Äôt use the chat groups though). I love seeing what my baby looks like and the detailed stages it shows your baby is at, from what they‚Äôre able to do, hear, taste, and they‚Äôre whole growing process. It also helps with things your body is going through as well and ways to help!!"
613,613,5,2018-09-02T08:30:55.000Z,HappyMommy619,Great app from the beginning!,"This app is awesome! It gives you tips and information from the beginning of your pregnancy and continues! It answers all questions! My baby is 6 months and I continue to use it daily. Given that all babies are different, this app gives you somewhat of a standard. It answers questions for the father as well! If you are pregnant or planning or have babies in general, DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS APP!"
614,614,4,2018-10-16T05:08:38.000Z,mother_Henny,From my first day of pregnancy to now,From my first day of pregnancy to this day (with a 15 month old) baby center has helped me navigate the beautiful and bitter sweet of motherhood. It‚Äôs a great general database for new mothers needing to learn the ropes and a helpful community of support for those already in the swing of things. I‚Äôll keep baby center for my future pregnancies and beside it being very informative it‚Äôs also super fun to take photos of your belly bump and compare it‚Äôs size to produce in the mobile app. Yay Baby Center!
615,615,5,2018-10-23T16:59:21.000Z,Desiree Claire,BabyCenter,"I love this app! It helps bring up articles and thoughts on subjects you‚Äôre probably already thinking about throughout your pregnancy and even after your child is born. It has helped inform me, and raise questions that I didn‚Äôt even know to ask, and gave you the answers to those questions. I‚Äôm so glad this app exists, if your expecting I would definitely download this app, it‚Äôs worth it."
616,616,5,2021-05-19T19:22:00.000Z,babymaka3000,Freakishly correct,"I sweat everything I‚Äôm going through they cover that week and explain the why. I even have a toddler and it tells me about him and his growth too and it‚Äôs always right. For example, he‚Äôll be throwing a lot of tantrums then I‚Äôll get an email that says your 14 month old is starting to find their voice tantrums are normal at this point. It has been very helpful with pregnancy too."
617,617,1,2021-06-07T20:05:34.000Z,almostD,Couldn‚Äôt load,"I have been having extreme pregnancy symptoms for a week or so now after a miscarriage, but it‚Äôs still too early for a test and have been wanting to talk to other moms to see if they have had the same experience.  I signed up, but tried loading it many, many times.  It said for me to check my internet connection each time and I did.  Everything was fine.  After trying for a few minutes, I decided to look at reviews and found that this app isn‚Äôt even good for supportive community.  I‚Äôm going to look for a different app. Thanks ladies for your honest reviews, they are so appreciated!"
618,618,5,2020-07-02T17:40:09.000Z,mommyLollie,Great app to keep track,I‚Äôm a very forgetful person so this app cane in really handy and also gave great development information about the baby week by week. After delivery it also shows you new milestones the baby will be achieving and has a great chat room where you could ask other expecting parents questions or just look for support. I recommend downloading this app.
619,619,5,2020-02-09T22:00:59.000Z,BedYourPardon,Great app for feeling apart of your Pregancy!,I am pregnant with my husband and my first child. It is very exciting but also so nerve wracking! Going to the OBGYN every month reassures me everything is going right but people don‚Äôt talk about the other 3 weeks that your waiting to be told everything is alright. This app gives me an update every week about what the baby is doing and how he‚Äôs growing and it has been great to ease my mind!
620,620,5,2017-12-01T22:43:01.000Z,jedi-mama,Awesome app,I love this app ! The updates that follow as your child grows and gives you tips and ideas on dealing with the ever changing volcano that is children lol. Being a mom to a five year old prior to having my now 3 month old son I thought I was on top of my mommy game but even though I‚Äôm confident in the level of love and care I give my kids this app allows me to not feel bad that I didn‚Äôt remember or know some things
621,621,3,2018-03-08T19:56:32.000Z,Valderal,I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs around but...,"The latest update for this app is terrible. Half the time I can‚Äôt get it to load past a certain point, especially in the birth club section of the app. I‚Äôve updated my phones software and and working to delete and re-ad the app. That being said I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs an app available for tracking your pregnancy and your child‚Äôs development (would be nice if that part lasted longer than a year)."
622,622,3,2018-06-25T12:52:41.000Z,Truffle1207,Like the app but keep having to login,"This app is really great. I love the layout and find it really easy to follow. Unfortunately, I get really annoyed because almost all the time it logs me out and I keep having to log back in. This seems like a silly annoyance, but it is annoying. Has anyone else experienced this? There is no rhyme or reason. Sometimes I‚Äôm logged off three times in a week and sometimes I‚Äôm not logged of for a few weeks. It happens literally every time on my iPad version, so I stopped using on my iPad."
623,623,5,2018-09-07T19:35:56.000Z,Kali R.,My favorite!,"I‚Äôve tried different apps between my pregnancy but there‚Äôs nothing like this one! I just love being able to connect with others who are going through the same things I am at the same moment and just listening to their stories is awesome. I also really like seeing what my baby might be doing, how big he is or learning what I might be experiencing soon and why."
624,624,1,2018-09-19T21:35:46.000Z,Emmie Liz,"Ok for pregnancy, terrible for loss",The app itself was ok during my pregnancy. Ok information provided. Nothing fantastic. I was 10 weeks pregnant when I lost my baby. The other two apps I used offered support for women going through miscarriages. They immediately stopped pregnancy updates and emails. They also offered online support groups. I tried stopping pregnancy updates from baby center but they still came for 3 weeks. I tried to unsubscribe many times. It was so painful to continue to receive updates for weeks after. My husband and I will try again when cleared by my OB and I will not be downloading this app again.
625,625,5,2018-11-01T11:21:22.000Z,Fieldinguinho,Very helpful,"I‚Äôve been tracking my pregnancy with this app and I‚Äôve feeling confident about everything related to my baby due to the many explanations on this app. Also I enjoy reading about the real experience with mothers on the community baby Center, where you can share or feelings or ask any questions or concerns. I like to receive a daily email to know what‚Äôs new with the baby, as well."
626,626,5,2018-12-05T14:08:18.000Z,mamakinch,Diverse perspectives; medically accurate content,"I have access to multiple baby-related sites and BabyCenter is the most reliable in terms of useful content that shares medically accurate and complete information. Every baby is different and each article shares a breadth of expectations in terms of how babies present (e.g., ranges of sleep expectations, eating, physical development). I find it particularly helpful to know that actual doctors are reviewing content."
627,627,1,2019-04-24T23:30:16.000Z,wisdomscreed,Send terrible emails,"This app allows members to argue, name-call, bully, and ‚Äúshare their opinions‚Äù in the rudest ways. Also, they send emails using fear tactics to scare you into doing what they think is best for your baby. I‚Äôve gotten emails that my baby will get measles, asthma, and allergies. They then gave me biased advice on how to protect my baby from these things- but yeah I wouldn‚Äôt say they researched much before giving their opinion."
628,628,4,2019-04-26T14:58:49.000Z,xeynab,"Luv this app, just need to tweek some bugs","Love this app! Used it all through my pregnancy and was very useful and informative. Even now that my baby is born I use it and it keep me up to date with my baby‚Äôs milestones. It‚Äôs just that sometimes it asks me to sign in and even if I click forget password it doesn‚Äôt allow me to reset password, other times it just automatically signs me in without asking for any password...just need to sort out this bug"
629,629,5,2020-11-04T15:30:03.000Z,Kri5tan,Love this app!,This app has given me a lot of confidence during this pregnancy. I love the ‚Äúis it safe?‚Äù And kick counts tools. Helps tremendously to know what to avoid during pregnancy and to have a record of my baby‚Äôs activity readily available to discuss with my doctor. The weekly videos showing baby‚Äôs development and pregnancy symptoms to expect have given me something to look forward to and have allowed me to prepare.
630,630,3,2018-02-26T10:41:54.000Z,1032636Aw,Pretty decent,"It‚Äôs a very informative app I‚Äôm a male and I just like to read the articles. The app is pretty much gender based though. It makes me feel a little awkward. It just automatically assumes that I‚Äôm the mother. It doesn‚Äôt have a father option and if it does I‚Äôm not aware of it. It also just assumes that you‚Äôve had a daughter as well, using gender sensitive words like ‚Äúshe‚Äù even when I‚Äôve put in that I‚Äôm expecting a son or that I‚Äôve had a son. It‚Äôs a minor problem but it still made me fell like I shouldn‚Äôt be using this app."
631,631,5,2018-05-09T23:58:27.000Z,Smonty1999,LOVE THIS APP,"When I got pregnant, I was literally clueless. Up until my friend told me about this app. It has helped get me information and give answers to so many of my questions. Plus, it has the cute weekly bump pictures that we see so frequently on Pinterest. You can put cute, little emojis by them and what week you‚Äôre at. I love it. If you are expecting or have a child, this seriously is the app for you."
632,632,5,2018-10-04T18:14:13.000Z,aliciajr89,Love the weekly reminders!,Working full time can somewhat take the joy and focus away from the preggers experience and so the weekly reminders of how far along you are or the updates on how your little one has changed and grown is such an awesome thing to receive! So much good information that you could search for and videos to keep you as informed as you wish to be.
633,633,5,2018-11-26T17:53:58.000Z,Mrs_herrera,Great App!!,I love this app. There is so much information available. The weekly updates are so helpful and fun to see how your pregnancy (and later new baby) is progressing. I‚Äôm always on here reading the articles and looking things up that I may have questions about. It‚Äôs easy to navigate and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with its performance. I would definitely recommend it to expecting mamas!
634,634,5,2020-07-19T14:22:53.000Z,5AVAA12,Ive had this app from period to baby love it,I had this app to keep track of my period it helped me know when not to get down in the bedroom but i stopped keeping track and then boom i got pregnant lol. But throughout my whole pregnancy from day 1 even to know i use it to help keep me updated on everything. It lets you know whats going on answers questions and concerns its amazing idk what id do without it.
635,635,5,2020-05-05T11:38:24.000Z,jylm123,Love it!,This app is the only one that has information that I actually trust. I love the tools although for some time the growth tracker wouldn‚Äôt show up and I lost all of my babies information from months üò© I didn‚Äôt have it anywhere else since this is my number 1 app but it seems like it‚Äôs back and I‚Äôm expecting another baby in a couple of weeks so I really hope it stays üòä.

I am a very organized and planning forward person- this app gives the tools and lists I need to properly prepare for the new edition to my family. I particularly love that each article read is reviewed and vetted by doctors, physicians and professionals who are experts of the topics."
637,637,5,2019-09-11T09:32:46.000Z,Rose ü•Ä,Great App!!!!!,"Im a first time mom and i got this app when I first found out I was pregnant.

The milestones are always accurate timing and keeps me updated. If I ever have any concerns I can always check here before asking my doctor (if it‚Äôs minor concerns).

I absolutely LOVE this app. It was sooo helpful during my pregnancy but ESPECIALLY after. The community board available is amazing. There are so many helpful topics they cover from babies born the same month to finances to helping with marriage/divorce issues. It has replaced social media for me, because I actually benefit from its use. Highly recommend!!! Thank you babycenter!"
647,647,5,2020-12-28T14:30:39.000Z,Mercedes MR.,Best App Ever,"I loved keeping track of my baby‚Äôs development using Baby Center. The app is informative about my body as well, and the suggested articles made me feel informed week by week. I also appreciated the section of safe vs warning vs unsafe activities/products to help me make good decisions! I felt more connected to my baby and my changing body than I would have ever! Specially being a first time mom."
648,648,2,2021-01-05T17:45:27.000Z,Erika8457,"Terrible, catty women, unsupportive","There are a good number of women in these blogs that are nothing but rude, dismissive, and condescending. There are a few who post simply for reactions and inciting drama. It leaves other users feeling too afraid to post for fear of negative backlash. It‚Äôs really a shame that a FTM seeking advice can‚Äôt bring themselves to post or discuss because she would rather not risk being ganged up on."
649,649,3,2020-12-30T03:22:55.000Z,LoveBlessed88,Baby Center Review,I enjoy having this app on my phone because you have quick easy access to search different kinds of information.  I like receiving articles  via email and every week is a milestone and you learn about your growing baby.
650,650,5,2020-12-07T00:03:03.000Z,jjesssssiiiiiiiiiii,Great App for parents,Babycenter got me through both pregnancy. If I had any concerns I can communicate with other moms and connect with them too. I also get email updates about my 3 month old every month and I still get updates on my 7 year old each month since he was worn! I highly recommend this app to not just moms but ANY parent! Thank you babycenter and all the people there! üòÑüôÇ

Even though I‚Äôm not A first time mom, it‚Äôs been 8 years since I‚Äôve been through a pregnancy and life with a newborn, so the support and guidance from the weekly readings was interesting. I especially enjoyed the weekly bump pictures, and learning about my baby girl‚Äôs development each week!"
652,652,5,2020-09-28T20:30:59.000Z,Caitoles,Love!!,"I love that this app has not only a tracker for your baby, however seeing your body change as well to use pretty incredible. They include a body tracker with details about the changes happening to you as well as your baby! LOVE THANK YOU! Especially because my obgyn isn‚Äôt taking appointments until 12 weeks so this app provides a lot of clarity behind what is going on! Thank you!"
653,653,5,2020-05-21T01:06:40.000Z,JenPenelope,Helpful for Moms of all Stages,"This app has developed quite a bit over the years. There‚Äôs so much to explore and learn. I love that no matter if you‚Äôre a young mom, a new mom, a mom of 5, or a high risk mom, there‚Äôs something for you! The videos are high quality, the pictures is bright, and there are ways to customize app information for your personal needs. Definitely my favorite of the pregnancy apps!"
654,654,3,2020-06-14T00:04:23.000Z,Gamer rater222,Would be better if all the features worked,"The app crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I use the bumpie feature. Whether I am uploading a new pic or trying to view my older pics, it crashes without fail. Also, the newer version layout is nice but hardly ever works. When I click on the icons from the home page, it links to a blank white screen. If I go to Baby Center‚Äôs website, the links work there and I can view the videos and see the weekly progress updates, but not it the app."
655,655,5,2020-04-27T17:03:36.000Z,alexisrenee26,Love this app,"Gives amazing in-detail week by week descriptions of how you‚Äôll feel during and pregnancy to make sure your baby is healthy and on the right track. I thought this app was done being amazing after birth but no, they also give you week by week description on how your baby should be developing every week. This saves me from so much anxiety, I absolutely love it!"
656,656,5,2020-02-20T02:44:51.000Z,sharlin g,Love love love it,"This app is amazing !! I just found out I was pregnant two weeks ago with my first child so I couldn‚Äôt be anymore confused on how this whole pregnancy thing works and this app has narrowed everything down for me down to what I can eat and not eat, which prenatals are best, how big my baby looks each day etc. Wouldn‚Äôt change a thing about this app definitely recommend."
657,657,5,2019-06-22T18:04:13.000Z,Virgo Princessüíô,Outstanding!,This app is filled with so much helpful information! Any questions I have had they were completely answered through the week by week breakdown!
658,658,4,2019-07-25T14:14:37.000Z,ashleebear0351,Too many jerks,I would love this app and recommend it to other moms if it weren‚Äôt for the serious lack of guidelines in their birth groups. There are some awful people on there that continue to harass and bully and belittle etc. nothing gets done and it just continues. You can‚Äôt ask a single question without someone being incredibly snarky and rude. Don‚Äôt even get me started on if you try to defend yourself. It‚Äôs you against the internet at that point.
659,659,5,2019-06-15T21:52:19.000Z,angelstardesign,I like this app!,"I like this app because its reliable. It‚Äôs like a guide that helps you through the tough time. If your expecting this app to account for everything then your wrong. There will never be an app that accounts for the unexpected, but this app helps tremendously. I get to know what to sort of expect during each week, and even when the baby is born. Thank you all for this app!."
660,660,5,2018-01-24T07:20:18.000Z,Lido_penguin,From the heart broken mommy to be...,I just lost all of my baby bump pictures because your app doesn‚Äôt save any of the bumpies to your profile if the app gets removed from your phone even though you set a log in. I‚Äôm in tears... why would you guys set it up this way...
661,661,5,2018-03-21T14:23:44.000Z,pickensb,Love This App!,It‚Äôs nice to be able to know exactly where your baby is growth wise as you go through the weeks of pregnancy. I love also that you can share in the experiences of others as well as explain your experiences and ask questions with things you may going through. It‚Äôs comforting to know you have other pregnant mothers or mothers who have all ready ‚Äòbeen there done that.‚Äô
662,662,5,2018-10-07T22:30:18.000Z,GloriousKLove123456789100,Baby,"Love the app, overall it‚Äôs great to see he growth of my baby and be able to be in groups of people that are in the same trimester going through all the same things at the same time.

Being a first time mom I had loads of questions and many times o would forget said questions with all the hustle and bustle. Then as if by magic, the app literally would have an article about my question. It‚Äôs great because there also other moms for support but mostly the articles are my favorite. I am still using the app and my daughter is almost 5 months old!"

Then I really enjoy reading all the milestones expected by months and years, let me tell you every kid  is different. My daughter is 3 yo now and I still get weekly information and food ideas, like snacks for daycare. I really recommend this app for every mom. Even grandma enjoys it."
665,665,5,2021-05-15T16:22:21.000Z,ilyxd420,Love it!!!,I‚Äôve been using this app sense I got pregnant. It has such great educational articles to read. It‚Äôs also a great place to go to ask other mothers questions and / or to just talk about whatever. It puts you into a group of women who are due the same month as you. I really love this app and will continue using it until my daughter is old enough to where I don‚Äôt need it anymore.
666,666,5,2021-03-25T01:57:26.000Z,amandagdc08,Great informative app,"No matter how I‚Äôm feeling or what questions I have in all occasions I‚Äôve been able to find some answers on the BabyCenter app. I love it, it always gives me updates on my baby‚Äôs developing and size, as well as, questions and concerns I may have.

Every week I look forward to the milestones or just another article of what I should be expecting. I just love reading to learn more and more about my little ones world. Or how he‚Äôs recovering the world I guess. This app was perfect since the day I found out I was pregnant.

I feel like I have a community of moms and friends to learn from, ask questions, get support and advice and also give my own advice about anything in life! .

No. It‚Äôs also not as fun as it used to, they allow people who don‚Äôt align with your beliefs to delete your comment without review. They pander to political correctness, bcse I‚Äôve complained as well since I have no problem saying and talking to others about my comments. But they kept deleting my comments and refusing to let me know why besides telling me that they are listening to someone else‚Äôs reason instead of mine as well.  When they become unbiased I‚Äôll download again but until then I just plan to never use it again."
677,677,5,2019-06-25T18:59:13.000Z,Linnnnda_,Great app,"It has everything.. from support groups to community posts for things you may be curious or have questions about.

I‚Äôve tried restarting, clearing out my recent and going back in and nothing seems to be able to fix this problem. I‚Äôm going to have to start using a different app, it would be nice if you could fix it really soon that way I could stick with this app."

I wouldn‚Äôt buy from these companies simply because they are disrupting the app experience and are intentionally blocking use. I can‚Äôt type a comment without one of these ads blocking the comment box and redirecting me to their site. I hope their click through rate goes through the roof with this tactic all just to annoy a potential customers and have no conversion from it.

693,693,5,2019-03-23T23:00:17.000Z,CcLynnH,3rd pregnancy! Love it!,I used this with all 3 of my pregnancies. They have support groups with other moms that help you with anything you need. Which was awesome with my 2nd pregnancy. I had a miscarriage and when I changed the setting on the app it automatically started sending all these miscarriage support groups. That helped a ton. It also tracks your weekly pictures and kick counter at the end. It‚Äôs a great app!

Everyday there was something new to read and you could jump ahead and see the actual date and day. There was also more things to read when you clicked on your body or your baby. Now it just goes by the week, there are so many ads, and what little there is to read is usually covered by ads. Also some of the information in the articles is incorrect. I miss the old app before they updated. I‚Äôll be looking for something else to track my second pregnancy."

I highly recommend this app! Easy to use and it keeps you involved with your babies weekly progress, as a first time mother. This app has answered all my questions and helped guide me on the right birth path without leaving any information behind!"
699,699,4,2020-04-28T13:13:08.000Z,Danielle1987!,Great app to help remember,"This app helped me throughout my pregnancy and now helping with those questions while i raise my daughter. I do see sometimes things our of order or weeks after my daughter already reached those milestones but overall helps. I do wish it had more on formula fed babies. I read alot of breast feeding, but I had alot of question with formula. How much to give, when to give more, feeding schedules or when do you increase the ounce."

Every single question I ever had it had an answer for and being able to ask actual people questions and share my own situations to people that have questions was so comforting. I had a healthy baby boy because of this app. Now I‚Äôm pregnant with my second and hoping for a girl. This app will give me the best quality again.

You want answers and real stories to help motivate you along the way. This app definitely delivers in more ways than just one. I look forward to an update every week. It‚Äôs the highlight of my days. So much information. Really a great help! Thanks to the creators.
703,703,5,2019-01-30T16:16:32.000Z,VeraPoly17,Love this app pregnancy and now,I really like babycenter app. I started using it when I found out I'm pregnant and it was so great each week to learn new developments and I enjoyed reading the articles with my husband. I even used the contractions tracker before going to hospital. Once my baby was born it's been really helpful!!! Articles and mom boards are nice. I enjoyed each week tracking my babies developments.
704,704,5,2021-07-23T19:47:55.000Z,168sjr,Easy And Simple,The look of the app makes everything easy. I love getting weekly updates through pregnancy and long after. It is a simple app and gives simple information. It is just enough information to get you by. I am in my second child and used this app for both. The contractions timer worked great while in labor as well.
705,705,5,2021-05-05T04:02:57.000Z,HeidiABaker,A must have app for new moms!,"I used this app all through my pregnancy and I still use it very often as my daughter is growing up! Love the search option when I have questions! This app is spot on, great, accurate information that matches up with the information I get from our doctors office. I recommended it to any first time mom now, because of how much it has helped me!"
706,706,4,2021-07-17T04:04:08.000Z,StriderScraper,Good info but videos don‚Äôt work,"I love the app for the most part. I love the information it gives for every week. I love the tools like the bump photos and kick counter! I used this app for my last pregnancy and used the contraction timer when I was in labor. The only bad thing that takes a star off is the videos in the app won‚Äôt work. It looks loaded, but the add will never ever play and there‚Äôs no play button. Just ‚Äúdone‚Äù or ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù."
707,707,5,2021-01-20T01:49:53.000Z,KSBB03,I love this,There is so much information on here. And I love how it gives you updates on a variety of different changes and the development of the child. It has tons of resources! There‚Äôs nothing that you can‚Äôt find on this app! There‚Äôs not only helps you as a mom but it‚Äôs also some thing you can share with your husband!I love this app and I recommend it to everyone!
708,708,5,2021-01-05T02:10:15.000Z,Kayla SDR,Baby Center App,"I love this app the suggestions and updates and other members you can communicate with and resources they provide you with. Your body and changes to the baby week to week. And a huge plus it gives you a count down to your due date how incredible is that. What foods to eat, this app have too many things to list. I absolutely love this app!!!!"
709,709,5,2020-12-23T04:39:43.000Z,C&JM44,Most helpful,"BabyCenter has made our first pregnancy much more simple and less scary! It gives regular updates about developmental progress week-by-week, along with helpful emails full of registry tips, tips for finding a birthing class, and other essentials! Out of all the apps I downloaded when we found out we were expecting, BabyCenter is the only one I need!"
710,710,5,2018-06-05T05:14:19.000Z,tina_gail,Baby Love,"With baby #2 it is really nice to have the week by week articles and development updates to refresh me and keep me grounded on all the little details. With my first I really utilized the group chat and found it both entertaining and helpful. All around the best app from when you find out your pregnant til...well...I don‚Äôt know, my first is almost 4 and I am still using it."
711,711,5,2018-12-04T22:19:30.000Z,Jocie Ortega,I love baby center!!,"I have used the baby center app since I had my first child. I stumbled across it because I was searching for a website to tell me details about my growing baby. I absolutely fell in love with it! I love how their specific, show images and you can ask almost anything related to pregnancy, postpartum and everything you need to know about your baby! So thank you!!!! :)"
712,712,5,2018-12-06T20:48:22.000Z,Chevybabe,Great Experience,I was super busy through out my pregnancy with work and traveling at times for work but I stayed in touch with all the pregnancy need to know information through this app. Was super convenient because I wasn‚Äôt able to go to classes. And as I‚Äôm in early labor (this is my first baby so I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing or what lies ahead) as I‚Äôm writing this I‚Äôm really appreciating the contraction timer!
713,713,4,2019-03-21T13:50:09.000Z,Medaafaqq,I love this app,I‚Äôve been using this app this I was pregnant at 6 weeks and my baby is now 8 months old. The app has helped me so much especially being a new mom and a first time mom you get very curious and very skeptical on certain questions and statements. The app allows you to reach out to many other moms and not feel alone in this process plus it gives you amazing updates on general info about your pregnancy or your baby.
714,714,5,2020-11-11T12:50:17.000Z,beezymommy17,Love the features!,"This is just one of the many features but the 3-D interactive model of baby & mom each week is so realistic and my 3-year-old son loves it. It's been the perfect way to teach him about his new sibling & show him where baby is. He thought the ultrasound I showed him was ""tea"" but he calls these models ""baby!"" He asks to check on baby frequently, zooms in on different parts & talks about it."
715,715,5,2020-11-10T02:54:35.000Z,AJ & KC,Love this app,I used this app for my first two pregnancies. This is now my third pregnancy and I reverted right back to this app. It has everything you need. So much information that you will need. I love how it has so much names for the moment where you cant figure out what to name the baby.  The updates it gives you are amazing. I would recommend this to this to any female who is pregnant.
716,716,5,2020-09-01T17:33:22.000Z,BreanneRoot,Highly Recommend,I absolutely loved this app when I was going through my first pregnancy and now that I‚Äôm pregnant again I absolutely had to redownload it and go through this one! Your app give such amazing information and really  gets you to understand everything going on with your baby and your body on the inside you really know and I absolutely love it!
717,717,5,2019-07-07T22:37:57.000Z,gardning mama,Useful,"I like this sight, especially for the question and answer threads of other users, but it‚Äôs also a fun place to track pregnancy progress and lo‚Äôs growth afterwards.  I still use my pediatrician and real books for the most important decisions, but since everything is new to me, it‚Äôs a great place to start.  Lots of people parenting in lots of ways sharing ideas with each other."

719,719,5,2021-07-27T22:58:16.000Z,Listener #214,A really helpful guide,I love getting updates about my child‚Äôs development at the time it‚Äôs relevant. Books are great too but can be overwhelming and hard to remember everything you‚Äôve reviewed. Receiving guidance based on the exact age of your child is awesome. I‚Äôm a working mom and doing my best to stay engaged and in tune with my child‚Äôs growth and needs and this app is like a lifeline for me. I really do love it!
720,720,5,2021-07-22T16:18:46.000Z,mro1273tieuwub,Everything in 1 place,"Easy to understand and gets to the point. Learning a lot and fun to get the weekly updates. Everything I want to know is in one place- including the much needed ‚Äútools‚Äù for all the things to avoid. I did, however, download a different app for photos, since I liked their editing tools better, but overall- VERY HAPPY with this app!"
721,721,5,2021-07-10T19:03:27.000Z,BaddestHadsRocksThe Rads,Needed assurances,"As a first time want to be mother, I always have more questions than I even know how to answer. And this app gives me reliable, safe information on just about everything. I had a miscarriage and it helped me understand that too. I like the community aspect and the fact that I can keep myself sane by looking up article whenever I start to freak out."
722,722,5,2021-05-31T14:19:14.000Z,ShanboJ,Great app!,This app is very informative and helpful for parents and parents to be. It is an exhaustive resource I refer to almost every day. Just always keep in mind that babies are all different and you shouldn‚Äôt necessarily be surprised or worried if your baby doesn‚Äôt act like others in some aspects. Just see you pediatrician and work on helping them meet their goals as best as you can.
723,723,5,2021-04-22T12:34:10.000Z,AlejandraLizzeth,Very useful,"It helps you connect with the exact moment you are experiencing with your little one inside, more information that I could ever imagine, very useful healthy tips also. Learning so much with the weekly video and information received for what the baby is experiencing, what is my body experiencing, and what to be ready for at every stage, completely love it!!!"

Easy to navigate, find helpful tools and information to reference. Takes you step by step from conception to birth. Even has insightful tips for baby after they‚Äôre born. Highly recommendable for new parents!!"
726,726,5,2020-12-07T17:50:09.000Z,Em Seeg,Love it,"I love the weekly updates I have been getting since the day I found out I was pregnant. I loved learning about how my body was changing during pregnancy, and I love getting weekly updates even after my baby was born. I love reading about the milestones that my baby should be doing or will get ready to do. This app is very informative and offers other resources for parents."
727,727,5,2020-12-01T13:15:36.000Z,BrittRena,Love it,"This app has been my go to. And everything it shows each week I‚Äôve experienced lol, but it‚Äôs cool to know why you feel certain ways and how big the baby is. Everything the doctor has stated is right on target with the app, size, weight, weeks and due date. I would love if it gave you more info on ideal weight gain for each trimester just for an idea."
728,728,5,2020-11-28T10:34:40.000Z,sandronata,Save button,"I really like the application, the only thing i‚Äôm always missing and wish there was a save button... so I could save the articles I like and read them later, or whenever I want to... as I have 2 months baby ans not enough time, it‚Äôs hard to read everything you are interested in, so, save button is definitely needed! Thanks :)"
729,729,5,2020-11-13T13:48:51.000Z,Scxo.98,I love this app!,"I‚Äôve had this app for both my pregnancies and it‚Äôs always accurate and very helpful with certain information that it has. It always gives me a little extra information or websites if i have more questions, It still has my information with my first pregnancy and she‚Äôs almost 3 lol.

731,731,5,2020-07-29T08:29:20.000Z,taemomma,MUST HAVE,"This app is absolutely amazing! From keeping up with your pregnancy week by week , symptoms and growing baby ... to even after birth , You can use the growth tracker to see what percentile your baby is in , Add photos and use cute stickers like ‚ÄúI got my first tooth‚Äù , This is the #1 app to me ... It has a lot of information about your baby‚Äôs growth and what‚Äôs going on at this stage of his/her life. Totally recommend!!!!!!!"
732,732,5,2020-06-24T20:58:59.000Z,Thus far,Really enjoy using this app,I have downloaded several apps. This app is the one that I use most. I like how information is set up and it‚Äôs not overwhelming. It has a lot of information and more when you click to learn more about it. The colors are great and Pictures are interactive. This app is user friendly and very well set up. I recommend it to all momma‚Äôs to be.
733,733,5,2020-02-17T16:16:53.000Z,Soso_Sw3et,Something for all parents,"Very informative without being overwhelming. There is information and articles for all parents, first time moms and ones who have been around the block and just need refreshers or access to new research. I love the variety in which information is given, written articles and videos/visuals to suit all needs, preferences or learning styles"
734,734,1,2020-05-28T06:56:33.000Z,Beautiiiiiiiful,New update is horrible!,"App takes forever to open up or freezes when I try to open it. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt open up at all!!! It doesn‚Äôt allow me to stay logged anymore in so I have to enter my email & password in every time (even though there is a stay logged in feature). App features such as weekly highlights, baby size, & your baby, take forever to load when clicked on or they don‚Äôt load up at all and the app freezes. Same thing happens when I click on the tools tab or birth club tab and the notifications tab doesn‚Äôt load at all!"
735,735,5,2020-02-16T01:57:17.000Z,Taci Grant,Amazing üòâ,"Each chapter of information is incredibly helpful and well explained. I love the baby‚Äôs size schedule, the videos, the 4D baby‚Äôs pictures. I‚Äôm loving all of it. Lots of extremely important information in one app. I‚Äôm at 15 weeks and 5 days now and I have been following this app since my 7th week, plus I‚Äôll continue using it until after my baby is born. üíóüôèüòç"
736,736,5,2019-12-06T09:30:55.000Z,akosua_khozie,I can not login on another phone with the same account,The app is great. Recently I got a new phone and I tried to login on that phone but it keeps on failing. I even downloaded the app on another iphone and tried login but still keeps on phone. I can only logout and login on the old iphone. Any help with that because I want to use the app with my account on my new phone.
737,737,5,2019-12-02T13:49:29.000Z,Carlha13,Love it!,"Love the daily articles, the forums and the weekly updates."
738,738,5,2019-07-10T16:53:26.000Z,Makayz77,Really Fun App!,"This is a really cool app. As a pregnant woman, you google almost EVERYTHING. But this app has so much info you don‚Äôt even need to google stuff half the time! I love being able to take ‚Äúbumpies‚Äù and having them all in one place with dates. My last pregnancy photos got really jumbled and I don‚Äôt even know how far along I was in most of them üò≠ if you are pregnant this app is fun for you! Get it!"
739,739,4,2019-11-10T10:34:19.000Z,Ginakristin,He/Her,I really really like this app. It‚Äôs very user friendly and great for preparing you to be a parent and getting to know your baby. My only criticism is that it‚Äôs not gender neutral in descriptions and the descriptions don‚Äôt change after you put the baby‚Äôs gender in.
740,740,5,2017-10-18T04:07:49.000Z,Christine And Seth Jr,Love this App,This app has been amazing. I've been using this for my whole pregnancy because it's my first baby and I was completely clueless as to what to expect! So much information but it's given to you in a way it's not too much all at once. They also give you articles and recommendations based on other moms experiences. Will continue to use this app after my son is born.
741,741,5,2017-10-22T11:47:04.000Z,Vamp1891,Awesome and helpful,After seven years of not having a baby and then to finally have one. This app is so helpful with all the different changes of growth going onüôÇ. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without baby center between my pregnancy and my 10-month-old this app has been awesome and giving advice and keeping me strong when I didn‚Äôt know what to do.üòä thank you for BabyCenter.
742,742,5,2017-11-15T07:29:27.000Z,MommyVenia,Great way to feel like you have a friend who understands,"This app is way more than I anticipated. I thought I would help me to be able to gauge how far I am from pregnancy due date. I never imagined all the other aspects. Such as the size comparison, help videos, blogs with common questions and some really good advice. Great way to feel like I had a friend who understood and anticipated many of my concerns."
743,743,2,2017-11-25T18:08:56.000Z,gdnewbie,Recent update has made this app so hard to use!,"Hoping glitches get fixed soon- but app runs slower, hard to type, pages freeze, and I‚Äôve been getting the same feedback from other moms in the baby center community. I haven‚Äôt written a review previously, but in the past it would have been much more positive. Goes to show I fall I the bucket of complaining when things stop working. Though I still wouldn't  have rated it a 5 due to little annoyances with the app, but a solid 3.5- now a two based on current issues."
744,744,5,2018-02-06T11:41:40.000Z,Mrs s Claus (nat),Loving it,"I had a different app before that stopped most of their features at 16 weeks unless I pay. I deleted that one and downloaded this instead. I love the updates I receive via email because I don‚Äôt always go into the app. It has given me so many ideas and has been a source of comfort for me. I have, since, been recommending this to many others."
745,745,3,2018-03-14T18:15:19.000Z,Asdfghjklpoqjd,Could be better,"Babycenter is just an awesome site. The information is SO helpful. The community is so great! I really find myself using babycenter daily. BUT the app is just terrible - especially the birth club tab. It is so outdated and so slow. It crashes almost all the time and is not user friendly at all. I agree with a previous reviewer, the app just seems like a mobile version website. It‚Äôs so hard maneuvering between posts and comments. Please make this a better app and do babycenter justice!"
746,746,3,2018-05-10T19:37:12.000Z,mmseid,Great app but not working now?,I loved this app for going through my pregnancy. All the updates and information was so helpful especially being a first time mom! And now having the little one and getting updates for them but all of a sudden the app kicks me right out I can‚Äôt even get to the first page? I still get emails but to continue to read anything by going into the app it kicks me right out???? I have updated the app and still nothing??? Anyone else have this issue?
747,747,5,2021-07-13T22:05:35.000Z,calijeanbean,Best Pregnancy App,"I don‚Äôt write reviews often but this app is A-MAZING. Helped me build my registry, explained how I‚Äôd feel and what to expect during pregnancy, it is very informative on things you should be aware of to keep you and baby safe as well. I still use it to read on exercises to do with baby and it shows milestones for them to reach and how to get them learning! Love it. Perfect for a new momma too! -XoXo"
748,748,5,2021-04-26T04:40:33.000Z,revealthereal,Two kids 4 years apart and I use this app,"I love it for updates on what my baby is doing from womb to earth. It helps me understand my babies development. Also helped with the understanding of where they should be mentally, physically and emotionally. All parents need this, it‚Äôs the closest thing to a hand book. Let me not forget the forums that I interact on. It‚Äôs great chatting with fellow parents who get it."
749,749,2,2021-03-10T02:01:09.000Z,Marabella23,New updates are horrible,"I always liked Babycenter but the recent updates are horrible. If I click on a post in the forum to read through it and decide it‚Äôs nothing I can give input on, then there is no longer a back button to go to the post right above. I have to start all over again looking through all the posts. This was never an issue before the new and ‚Äòimproved‚Äô update. So disappointed. I don‚Äôt have time to scroll through the same posts over and over again. Major downgrade."
750,750,3,2018-06-17T21:55:01.000Z,Frugalmom12345,Size comparison is jacked up.,"Although there is some good information, there are other things that make me stop and say ""huh?"" Spaghetti squash are bigger than any mango I've seen. Limes are bigger than pea pods. Avocados, and apples are about the same size most of the year. As are green peppers and heirloom tomatoes. And comparing a baby to a banana or carrot is completely subjective because those can range from 4 inches to 14 long depending on the variety. If they want to give you an idea of the size of the baby, they need a better system."
751,751,4,2018-07-23T12:37:49.000Z,happybutnotsatisfied,Great app-but makes me sign in all the time,"I really have enjoyed this app while pregnant! However, I will say the one thing that is not so great is it‚Äôs constantly signing me out and making me sign back in. This is pretty low on the glitch scale, but it would be nice if I didn‚Äôt have to sign in every 2 days. The other pregnancy apps I use don‚Äôt do this, and I‚Äôm usually more inclined to just look at those since I don‚Äôt have to keep signing in."
752,752,5,2018-09-05T00:12:51.000Z,WifeyVasquez,What To Expect?,"I‚Äôm so glad I had this app during my pregnancy. It‚Äôs very basic, but clear and straightforward, and I knew what to expect every step of the way. Of course some info like weight and inches can be slightly off but that‚Äôs only because every pregnancy is slightly different. Looking more into it there‚Äôs also mommy blogs and chatrooms, etc... just.. a lot of resources. Thanks Baby Center!"

Reading along with each phase helped me to understand and love each part of my pregnancy and my growing baby inside. Post baby, the articles are always helpful and just fun to read. I love getting the weekly updates in my email."

It‚Äôs great knowing you can still look up post create some & just see if you relate to stories it‚Äôs like having secret support worldwide very awesome I‚Äôll continue to use further on .

The information allows me to be current and relative when talking them about their children. We celebrate milestones. When I am watching my grandchildren, I better appreciate the choices each parent is making. I set alerts in BabyCenter so the email reminders make it easy."

I have a few problems with this app though.I feel like it is kinda cheap on information, and it is kind of hard to find some information. If this app could have a filter through the search bar. I would love to have more information on natural pregnancy and birth or at least a way to find it. Thank you"

I've always had the same baby on there from when I tracked my pregnancy with her! She is 2 now and my app now says she is 11 months old! I checked her birthday and it definitely still says she was born in 2018, so I'm definitely confused. I also loved answering the poll questions & now i can't even find any. The app used to have a ton of information and now it's just confusing and disorganized i can barely find information."
758,758,3,2020-04-30T15:04:26.000Z,Jmsan114,"Beneficial yet at the same time, not","I love the articles given by baby‚Äôs age. Sometimes, they‚Äôre a little too late because my baby has already gone through the change but that‚Äôs not a big deal. The big deal is the videos are not captioned. I‚Äôm currently struggling with starting my second child on solids and saw there‚Äôs a video about baby-led weaning but it is not captioned and I have yet to find a transcript for that video. This would be beneficial for me but I don‚Äôt have language access."
759,759,5,2019-06-23T15:09:42.000Z,rrrrrebecca4,Informative and fun!,"Love this app! My husband has the app on his phone too and we both get to share in the updates about our baby‚Äôs development! My children love watching the videos with me about what baby is doing/looking like now. Its such a wonderful app! I definitely recommend it! I have referred to it when i have questions about braxton hicks, heartburn, diet etc. so informative!"
760,760,5,2017-12-19T02:40:22.000Z,changedMyNameToMom,1000 answers,"I have never had so many questions as I do now as a new mom. In your first time around everything that you do and don't do leads to many many questions and surprisingly this app seems to have an answer for everything. Read vital information ,ask everything that concerns you, and share your experience to help more mothers."
761,761,5,2018-05-06T20:58:44.000Z,Luluu555,Almost there!,I‚Äôve used this app almost every day throughout my pregnancy. There are tons of tools that are useful and easy for clueless first time moms. I get my weekly email update on what my baby is doing in the womb. I love seeing the weekly blog posts and polls so I can feel better about what other moms experience. Currently 38 weeks pregnant and this app is putting me at ease for what to expect.
762,762,5,2018-06-06T05:49:51.000Z,EvieDes,Great website - Much Needed Info!!!,I‚Äôm about to be a first time grandmother and I am beyond excited!  I have used this site to track Baby D‚Äôs growth and other information.  A lot has changed since I had my son 39 years ago!  Now information is truly just a search away.
763,763,5,2021-05-15T19:10:54.000Z,Brigot1,I love this app,"I really love this app, when I was pregnant it was so exciting and interesting learning about what was happening each week with my baby. Then after the baby was born learning what they should be doing or looking forward to what they should be doing is nice. Plus sometimes the app gives you ideas on what to do to help this along. So like I said, I really love this app!!"
764,764,5,2021-05-04T17:50:45.000Z,RrachieRay,My favorite baby tracking app!,The only thing I wish they had more of was videos of the babies development in the womb each week. My kids LOVE those videos to see how baby is growing and what it looks like in the belly. The photos and all the weekly info is really fun. I‚Äôve had 4 pregnancies and this is by far my favorite app for tracking/learning things!
765,765,5,2021-05-02T07:45:22.000Z,Joy Robison,Great to track pregnancy through birth of baby,This app has been great to me. It has helped provide me with amazing knowledge from my pregnancy to the birth of my son. It gave me clues on what was coming up and also provided me with knowledge the doctors office didn‚Äôt provide me with. It is a great app and I will highly recommend this app to any parent loving for an app that can provide guidance and other parent‚Äôs experiences.

Every time I‚Äôm going through something with my daughter needing to know if it‚Äôs normal, I find one of the parents asking the same question. Gives me ease to know we‚Äôre all in some way going through similar concerns and we talk about it and feel much better afterwards."

This is my third pregnancy and I still enjoy reading the info that they provide on how the babe is growing and other fun factoids. One suggestion...perhaps you could cater to women with multiple pregnancies a little more? Like, ‚ÄúThings to think about for your third kid...‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat you may have forgotten from your last pregnancy...‚Äù etc. Other than that, I find this a great tool and accompaniment to pregnancy üòÅ"

I met some AMAZING friends in my birth club and I‚Äôve even met a couple of them in real life! The day by day updates for development during pregnancy/infancy are awesome. As are the tools for growth and development. I would hands down recommend this app to anyone pregnant or that has an infant.

My wife and mother in law love hearing the weekly updates from me and it is fascinating to learn how the baby grows each week. The videos are great, the information is awesome and the bumpie gallery is pretty cool.  We started at week 6 taking pictures and now we are at week 28. This app has been great.

784,784,5,2018-10-22T05:05:51.000Z,Milka-pilka,Very educated and interesting,Was enjoying read all information for whole 9 month!
785,785,3,2019-01-17T15:43:20.000Z,Morethen1,What about the siblings,There‚Äôs nothing on here for the sibling to see and understand except for the actual videos of the baby in the womb. My daughter wants to see this weekly but I have to try to google one bc there is only a handful on this app. Leaving me annoyed with the app bc she is disappointed that she can‚Äôt see how her sibling is growing other then telling her what size baby is. Please consider having something to show the siblings there more then interested and need more visuals to understand.
786,786,5,2019-02-01T01:11:33.000Z,alibrnwel,"Great app for monitoring baby‚Äôs progress, photos, and for baby‚Äôs first year too!",We loved getting updates every week on the baby‚Äôs milestones. I love getting to use the stickers for ‚Äúbumpies‚Äù. I was so happily surprised how much I used the app after the baby was here too! It was actually more helpful and gave great advice and we used it a ton! I highly recommend this app! You‚Äôll use it daily!

788,788,5,2021-04-22T11:18:46.000Z,Lissyliss620,Greatest App for Pregnancy,"I absolutely adore this app. From the time I got pregnant this app has been my guide on what to expect, what super foods I should be eating, what exercises I could do, keeping me up to date on taking prenatal vitamins and also allowing me to store my progress as my belly grows with the ""bumpie"" feature. All in all this app is very informative and I'd highly recommend to any expecting mother!"

(Even moms behavior/mood swings are helpful tips) I just wish when you put your baby‚Äôs name, gender,birthdate that there‚Äôs an option to change all the descriptions to read about a baby to be HE or SHE. But I love this when I was pregnant and now almost a year after!"
791,791,5,2021-01-24T00:32:16.000Z,blyoung3,Great app all around,"Been using this app since I got pregnant and still use it.

I love the pictures and information of the week by week pregnancy."

795,795,5,2020-07-07T21:06:47.000Z,DoubleDizzle93,So great!!! Highly Recommend!,All the information is so helpful and navigating the app is so easy. The only edit I would make is after you are done with an edit on your bumpie you can‚Äôt go back and change the text or placement of sticker once you‚Äôve hit ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. You have to start the whole picture over. But that‚Äôs minor! Other than that love the app!

As a pregnant mom, it discusses the growth of your baby, what symptoms to expect (and how to deal with them), and what to expect at doctors visits. As a new mom, it discusses your baby‚Äôs milestones, feeding tips, and personal care. I tried a couple of different apps and this one has the best information."
798,798,5,2020-05-10T16:10:22.000Z,fsarahi,I love this app,Becoming a mom for the first time can be really hard. I had so many questions and my doctor wouldn‚Äôt really answer many of them. His answer for everything was ‚Äúit‚Äôs normal ‚Äú with out actually explaining why i would feel that way.

803,803,2,2018-10-25T12:30:48.000Z,Akholmes,Constantly Crashes,"I want to like the app but it constantly crashes, even after reinstalling and updating it. I also find the community forums much easier to use online. The interface for the forums on the apps isn‚Äôt user friendly. You have to constantly hit the back button when you finish reading a post because if you accidentally hit the X, which makes sense, then the app quits the community forum entirely. I‚Äôve only had the app for a few weeks and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth the hassle to keep trying."

It was pretty neat how you were able to keep track of size and know what to expect and what your body could potentially be experiencing during the process. Now we‚Äôre on baby number 2!!

The app seems to offer support in every area needed; from community chats about weight gain and combatting medical diagnosis given in pregnancy to tips on creating a registry and checklist for each trimester. The Baby Center App has been a great resource and I‚Äôm very grateful for the knowledge and help obtained from it.

Great communities within the app, helpful mommas and knowledgeable information every day/week of pregnancy. I‚Äôm part of groups now that are only focused on my 3 y/o and groups focused only on my pregnancy.. Highly recommend it to first time moms/ parents."

I love all the resources available on literally any topic you need. Overall the app is exactly what I would need and expect for a baby tracking app to be.

Definitely would recommend"

I just wish the woman‚Äôs body/stomach that is displayed realistically moved with the growth of a pregnant woman. Most of our stomach show something after 4 or 5 months and hers still look flat for months in with a baby displayed inside. Also to have the option of a black woman‚Äôs belly and child growing as well as the gender once you find out. This is 2020 almost 2021, cater to other races please..."
818,818,1,2020-03-26T04:52:14.000Z,vkh9210,Toxic Bullies,This app has several toxic groups and Group Owners who will go out of their way to degrade and bully and tear down other women constantly and it‚Äôs totally allowed to happen. They literally look for ways to put others down and it‚Äôs sick and messed up. If you do still decide to download this app‚Äîsteer clear of the group called: Marriage & Romantic Relationships. Their group owners are the worst offenders. I‚Äôve never seen such terrible things written to other women before ever. And when women spoke up about their mistreatment they were ridiculed and bullied even further. It‚Äôs frankly just sad to see. Steer clear!
819,819,3,2019-08-03T15:29:52.000Z,Kroytoranna,Somewhat helps,"A little messy, didn‚Äôt get the idea. Just a pile of medical articles that I can search for myself. App is ment to make everything easy and give short tips, this one doesn‚Äôt though. Also the due date is counted inaccurate. I know the exact date of embryo impantation and it doesn‚Äôt match due date they suggest according to my last periodü§î."
820,820,5,2017-08-12T13:58:55.000Z,5DEmayoSOL,Very informative,"Great app, very informative compared to others and I really like the videos as well on the babies development. Plus their educational videos are also great. The bump pictures are cute as well to track as your belly grows. Just love it! This app has more tools than I use. I really enjoy the articles and recovers. The size of baby fruit comparison is cute. Recommend this app."
821,821,5,2018-02-06T14:51:28.000Z,arbriLOVE,Best one yet!,"Other baby apps don't take you all the way through the pregnancy. This one not only goes the whole way with you, but has helpful steps given to you everyday! I've learned so much about my baby, myself, and the pregnancy as a whole from just reading on the app from day-to-day. I'm a first time mom, and I'm glad I chose this app as helpful resource!"
822,822,5,2018-07-11T14:19:19.000Z,dvan7,Great resource,"I look forward to the weekly emails detailing the milestones babies should be reaching, yet you always emphasize that each baby is different and may be ahead or behind these milestones.  My baby was 7 weeks premature and Baby Center always reminds us that preemies May be a little behind and that is normal.  They‚Äôll eventually catch up.  Excellent resource.  Thank you."
823,823,4,2018-09-13T15:36:02.000Z,Peyton101316,Love this site/ the app needs work,I love using this website! As a first time parent and millennial mom this site has grown with me and my baby girl! It‚Äôs help ease my anxiety and stress. The only down fall i had was accessing the site via app. The app continually crashed for three months straight but luckily I received email updates to stay on track. But other than that‚ÄîI would definitely recommend this app to first time parents!
824,824,5,2018-12-18T03:56:56.000Z,tracy1388,Loooove it!,"This app helped sooo much while I was pregnant, Every week or other week I started feeling a little different and when I read the weekly journal thing it was on point! Every time! It was so crazy haha but made me feel more comfortable about how I was feeling or the due date board! When I had a question or concern I asked the mothers on my board super helpful I love it!"
825,825,5,2019-01-02T08:21:31.000Z,KauaiFever,Love it!,This was my first baby and I really like how it helped me keep track of my baby‚Äôs growth and development. The articles were very helpful (though some are advertisements and have to be taken with a grain of salt) and I didn‚Äôt realize until after the fact that it continues with development after birth. Would definitely recommend.
826,826,5,2019-03-25T12:57:15.000Z,ALynnaK,Great App!,"I love getting weekly reminders for how far along I am. It‚Äôs nice being able to search questions you have in the app, and seeing the progress of your baby. Any changes you‚Äôre having with your body are available weekly without me even having to look them up. It‚Äôs like the app knows me perfectly. So happy I downloaded this app!"
827,827,5,2021-03-12T11:11:06.000Z,Lokita0821,I love this app.,I‚Äôve been using this app since I was pregnant with my first child (he‚Äôs 11 years old now.) I‚Äôm now pregnant with my fourth child and decided to download this app once again for my daughter to track her baby brothers growth. She is so excited to check every week for changes. This app provides plenty of information and very easy to use.
828,828,4,2021-03-25T04:43:19.000Z,Lisajere,Second time around!!,This is now my second pregnancy and I logged back in after almost 8 years and it told me about my first baby and how old she is and what she‚Äôs into and how she is right now. I thought that was really neat to see that it was able to give me current info and details on her age as of now. I‚Äôm excited to use this app again this time around for my current/second pregnancy.
829,829,5,2021-01-17T13:56:06.000Z,Tinatonka,It‚Äôs All In The Details,I downloaded this app to track my granddaughters baby and I‚Äôm loving it! The intricate details are fun and really helps one to understand what‚Äôs going on in there precisely as it‚Äôs happening. The size comparison to fruits is a plus and seeing the whole pregnancy step by step is a real joy. Thank you for the Birdseye view of such a special time in all of our lives!
830,830,5,2020-12-27T20:10:09.000Z,Tiffany Mary88,Love the app!,This is my first pregnancy and I have been so grateful to have found this app because it‚Äôs helped me understand the different stages the baby is going through but also what I will go through since I had no idea what to expect. I suffer from anxiety so this has helped ease when I felt a bit off about something. Highly recommend it!
831,831,5,2020-11-23T15:02:56.000Z,Golden4lyf,"Great app, I will recommend to all mothers.","I Love to wake up every new week to a notification from baby center, it allows me to look forward to a new adventure with my daughter. She does new things weekly and this app saves me the stress of concern to why my baby behave a certain way. This is my first child and I plan on using this app for the rest of my kids to come."
832,832,5,2020-11-10T01:32:58.000Z,TrenBean,First time mom....must have this app!!!,I‚Äôm a first time mom and I‚Äôve used this app throughout my entire pregnancy and after birth milestones as well. The birth group feature and the bump selfie‚Äôs are my favorite things about it. You can connect with moms due around the same time as you and get insight and answers on things in a supportive format. Highly recommend for first time moms!!!
833,833,3,2020-11-14T14:52:26.000Z,Kortneyxoxo,Needs work but helpful,"I like the app, very useful with information. There‚Äôs a few glitches that need work. When taking weekly photos, some disappear after time and I can‚Äôt get those back on the week. The other glitch is when scrolling through pictures, the app closes down and won‚Äôt let me slide through them. Should also add more stickers, there aren‚Äôt enough that are ‚Äúcool‚Äù other than the same stickers for each week."
834,834,5,2020-10-23T14:15:52.000Z,Sashonwil,I love it‚ÄºÔ∏è,"It‚Äôs very informative and I never have to ask questions. It already answers my questions before I even think of them. My second pregnancy now and they keep me in the know, every time."
835,835,5,2020-06-23T04:25:02.000Z,Ambersteph,Thankful !,"I would recommend this app to anyone hands down, over any other app. It is such a well put together app and web sight, easy to use & so relatable ! I use it almost like a weekly advent calendar, waiting to see what the next weeks fruit or vegetable size comparison will be. I‚Äôve used it for both of my pregnancies now . New mom? This is the app you want!"
836,836,5,2020-02-23T22:57:16.000Z,MB1121,Amazing! Especially for new mama‚Äôs like myself.,Wonderful app that helps you know what to expect during pregnancy and afterwards. I love being able to ask other mama‚Äôs in my birth club questions or concerns I have and get their experiences as well. My daughter is one and I still use this app. It‚Äôs helpful on so many things even after they aren‚Äôt babies anymore. Love it!
837,837,3,2020-05-28T13:09:44.000Z,EmilyRChristie,Used to love but now it‚Äôs okay,"Currently 29 weeks, had been using the app the whole pregnancy, but the update for some reason didn‚Äôt fix bugs it gave the app more issues for me. I didn‚Äôt have any problems before and now when I try to load parts of the app I just get blank screens.. for instance I‚Äôll try to access the part that shows what‚Äôs going on this week, and just get a blank white screen. Happens for a few other features as well..."
838,838,5,2020-02-13T03:30:39.000Z,harleyü§ó,It has everything!,It tracks the size of baby while pregnant. It also gives you helpful information though out each week of pregnancy. It has a photo editor with stickers to use while pregnant and when baby is born. There is just an endless amount of things in this app and it is all free. I am so happy with this app!
839,839,5,2019-12-08T14:53:01.000Z,SHVITDHESCJIF H,Great for Poppas Too!,"Love the info they have and the videos. They help me understand (to the slightest degree... ladies I know we don‚Äôt know, but allows us to try and support our wives) some of what she‚Äôs going through and has given me info to suggest much more to investigate. The grandmas look forward to the weekly email that I forward them and we all love the progress updates."
840,840,5,2018-05-29T14:20:35.000Z,Danny the new daddy,New daddy dan,"Awesome app especially for new parents such as myself..everything feels personal, app is always giving you new information and telling you the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts it‚Äôs almost like having someone with you every step of the way, my daughter is here now and she‚Äôs beautiful :) thanks baby center for getting me through this wild, adventurous, scary but exciting ride!"
841,841,5,2018-07-27T16:47:11.000Z,Mom of QTPie,Number of children doesn‚Äôt matter,"It‚Äôs been 13 years since I had my last child and despite having all my‚Äùknowledge‚Äù of child rearing, this app was still EXTREMELY helpful.  It also helped me envision my new little one every step of the way which was great for my older kids that had questions they weren‚Äôt asking but wanted answers to."
842,842,5,2018-11-10T14:25:58.000Z,DreaPxAz,Accurate as h***,"I‚Äôm on my 4th pregnancy and I used this app with each one. However the only downside is this pregnancy I‚Äôm having twins. There‚Äôs no way to set it for multiples so you can see weekly development of twins instead of a single baby. You can search it it and info will come up, you just can‚Äôt set your profile with multiples. Other then that I love this app!!"
843,843,4,2018-11-30T00:10:02.000Z,DMNNJN,Great app,"The app is amazing and I love seeing my daughter grow and what she is the size of and what new functions she has! However, the app will log me out constantly and when I go to log in it tells me my password is incorrect. I‚Äôve had to change my password about 4 times now. If that could be fixed to where it‚Äôs not logging me out I would really appreciate it. Other than that, I absolutely love this app."
844,844,5,2018-12-12T03:43:20.000Z,Hides14,I LOVE Baby Center!!,I have been using Baby Center as my go to since my pregnancy with my daughter 7 years ago. Now going through my second pregnancy I am reminded just why I stuck with it the first time. I still get emails about what my 7 year old might be going through at school or at home and it‚Äôs always been an awesome resource for me! Thank you Baby Center!
845,845,5,2019-03-30T16:27:20.000Z,aparker187,Baby Center,Baby Center is a nice app that I really enjoy having! It shows you what your baby looks like inside your stomach and how tall and big your baby is depending on how far along you are. It also has a question and answers section where you can ask other women questions and answer questions about anything you want and more!
846,846,2,2019-04-15T21:18:35.000Z,nikkib1122,Friendly reminder,I have been using your app and receiving your emails for over a year now and I have noticed that in every article/post/email you use ‚Äúher‚Äù ‚Äúshe‚Äù ‚Äúgirl‚Äù... males are still being born and my husband and I find it offensive that everything is in the direction of females. In today‚Äôs day and age there shouldn‚Äôt be any sexism. Thinking about everything being directed towards females I find very sexist. Maybe using ‚Äúlittle one‚Äù ‚Äúbaby‚Äù or ‚Äúmini me‚Äù  might be safer if you don‚Äôt want to use male terms. Just a friendly reminder from a BOY Mom.
847,847,5,2019-06-10T08:26:01.000Z,Layla neems,Perfect guide,"This app has been awesome guide for the first time mom like me. Since the time we found out pregnant and till the date now ( baby‚Äôs 3 months old) , this app helped a lot. Everyday is exciting and this app gives a lot of idea how the things are needed to be done. I absolutely love this app and recommend every parents, whether first time baby or multiple."
848,848,5,2019-11-19T02:11:42.000Z,Llamalove9876,Love this app-answers all my questions,"I have enjoyed this app. Anytime I have a question-I find the answer here. Even to questions I think must be random and off the wall, to my surprise the answer is always on baby center. I also find confidence that the answers are majority of the time backed by a physician or scientific evidence. I recommend this app to all my friends."
849,849,5,2019-10-14T12:42:09.000Z,Kirstench94,Amazing,This app has been great my whole pregnancy! It counts down the days and tells you about changes you and baby go through each week. It‚Äôs my 4th baby and I wish I knew about this app with all the other ones. Plus you can save your ‚Äúbumpies‚Äù and watch your stomach grow from start to finish! Highly recommend using this app.
850,850,5,2017-11-11T14:27:47.000Z,LETohline,Helpful for a first timer,This is my first pregnancy and I‚Äôve been able to rely on this app to predict and warn me about what to expect each week. It‚Äôs been dead right which has been comforting to know what I‚Äôm experiencing is normal. It‚Äôs also so fun taking bumpies and seeing my baby‚Äôs growth from the inside with each weeks updates about what‚Äôs happening in my body.
851,851,5,2017-11-18T23:03:35.000Z,anilenapotts,The only baby app you will need,Love this app. They are packed with helpful articles not just for myself but for my husband as well! He downloaded it and keeps tracking everything I am going through. I can‚Äôt tell you how sweet and comforting it is to hear him come home and give me useful tips about things like foods to avoid or ways to overcome morning sickness.
852,852,5,2017-12-15T04:57:21.000Z,DianaAndradeFit,Perfect!,I love this app i got it as soon as i got pregnant and I absolutely fell in love with it. It has everything you need to prepare yourself to be a mom and sends you cute little tips every now and then. Keeps track of how far along are you and tells you what to expect week by week! It has so many cool features like the kick counter and the bumpie to track your growing bump :)
853,853,5,2018-02-09T17:16:02.000Z,Penguin0822,Pregnancy app,I used this app when I was pregnant with my first and I love how they sent weekly/monthly notifications/emails about his growth and milestones. I‚Äôm using the app this time for my 2nd pregnancy and love receiving notifications about my sons growth and facts/tips about which week of pregnancy I‚Äôm at. The app is informative and there‚Äôs groups you can join and talk to other moms. Highly recommend!
854,854,5,2018-02-20T05:14:10.000Z,Avani Vora,Very accurate,I am using the app postpartum. It provides weekly updates based on baby's age and has been very accurate so far. Helps be proactive as well as reactive to a situation. It also has useful videos and articles to educate a first time mom like me. Daddy too has this app and it helps him catch up to baby's progress inspite of spending most of the time at work.
855,855,5,2018-05-15T18:21:21.000Z,3 thumbs up,Great resource,I have thoroughly enjoyed this app throughout my pregnancy and now as a mom to a newborn. My colleagues and I realy enjoyed tracking baby‚Äôs growth every week as she was compared to a new fruit/veggie. The app has a wealth of information on what to expect and I found the baby boards as far as symptoms and symptom management. Wish this was around when I had my first 19 years ago.
856,856,5,2021-06-26T17:41:00.000Z,KillBillie,Great app!,"I‚Äôve used this app daily throughout my pregnancy. It‚Äôs been reliable and helps me to understand where I‚Äôm at and not to worry when I felt uneasy about something. I like that it has extra tools like a contraction counter and the ‚Äúis it safe‚Äù tab to see what‚Äôs safe or unsafe to do, eat, be around, and what‚Äôs products to stay away from during pregnancy."
857,857,5,2021-05-06T17:06:47.000Z,KathyMichelle,Keeping track is the best,My son is 8 months and this app has helped me keep up to date with all the questions that comes with having a child. Even while I was pregnant I really enjoyed keeping track of my what the baby could look like month by month and how my body was changing through the process.
858,858,5,2021-04-08T23:12:59.000Z,Awhisenhunt,Great pregnancy app!,"I get on this app daily. I look forward to the quick daily updates, as well as the longer weekly updates. The weight tracker is great! I started using it at the beginning of my 2nd trimester and update it after every doctor‚Äôs appointment. The weekly reads are helpful too!"
859,859,5,2020-07-21T16:22:08.000Z,H7o3m0e,Love this App!!!,"I love the update reminders and worry-free of what is going on with my daughter every week. She will progress before a reminder of her age suppose to do that week or month, or like ‚Äúnot to worry your child has not progress to this stage, she will soon‚Äù type of articles. It makes mine and my husband‚Äôs first-time-parenting. A lot easier!! Thank you so much!!!"
860,860,5,2019-02-24T09:18:42.000Z,BabyLovaaaa,I love it üòä,"I absolutely love how I can connect with other Soon To Be Mothers, and experience such organization while getting information on the growth of my baby! Keep it up Baby Center, your the best. I highly recommend this app for any Soon To Be Mothers and women/Couples that are trying to conceive! The information they give is totally 100 percent perfect and you understand easily!"
861,861,5,2019-04-07T14:45:34.000Z,Tamara1965,Amazing information to take the worries away!,I really like all of the information and how easy it is to access everything. Notifications are amazing!! We were excited to see what‚Äôs coming next. It was also helpful when talking to our doctor.  I really recommend this app for everyone. Especially grandparents like us!!
862,862,5,2019-06-06T19:22:20.000Z,Shayzinger,Great app!,Easy to use and super informative. I'm currently expecting my second baby and have learned so much from this app. Every week is related to where you are in your pregnancy and maybe answer some questions you have or even bring attention to something you haven't thought about. I would highly recommend.
863,863,3,2019-06-08T11:55:13.000Z,sopinkdms,Would have been 5 stars...,"Until just now, Baby Center was our favorite and go-to app for keeping up with our growing baby. Tonight, however, when we pulled up the video to cheerfully explain our 30th week of pregnancy, the ad that started to run before it was for a horror movie. Horror is right. The last thing this expectant couple wants to see before a sweet informative and animated baby video is a movie trailer about a possessed and evil doll. Please rethink your advertising choices."
864,864,5,2020-07-13T12:08:20.000Z,Anxious Pregnant Lady,Best app for pregnancy I have!!,"I have a couple apps for pregnancy, and this is my favorite. I love being able to look ahead to see how big the baby will be, what my body can be doing, etc. in the next couple weeks. I also love the ‚Äúis it safe?‚Äù portion!! It eases my mind so much to be able to look up common things and see what‚Äôs generally safe or not."

I am a first time mom and all information available is overwhelming, this app give you what you need to know at the right time in your pregnancy and after your baby is born with reliable sources of information.

866,866,5,2020-02-11T01:44:07.000Z,TinyDentist,Best App!,"All around super fun and extremely informative. I look forward to my weekly updates! Answers a ton of first mom questions and has so many cute features!! Would highly recommend this app to anyone having a baby, whether it‚Äôs your first and fifth baby, it‚Äôs always fun to keep track of their growth and check out if your symptoms are normal."

Now 4 months after im pregnant once again! Thank you baby center, you guys are changing a lot of family lives & giving a lot of helpful tools, information, & support!"
870,870,5,2018-05-14T13:08:07.000Z,bdbebejsn,Very helpful,I have been using baby center for all four of my pregnancies and I love it. They are very informative and helpful. Even after pregnancy! I still use the app to look at the developmental stages of each of my children as they grow older and I use it faithfully to read about different challenges with each age and stage. It‚Äôs like having a handheld parenting advisor
871,871,4,2018-05-30T20:57:41.000Z,hpentacoff13,Very useful and really informative!,"I am a first time mom, I had my son January 2018ü§±üèªüëºüèª Throughout my entire pregnancy I have used the Baby Center App and have loved it from day one!

872,872,5,2018-09-02T20:38:14.000Z,Ob Smart,Accuracy,"I am an ObGyn Physician and I find this app pry 98-99% accurate. I tell all my patients to use it to answer their questions and reassure themselves that what they are feeling / experiencing is normal.

I will definitely keep this app throughout the rest of this pregnancy and all other pregnancies I might have!"
874,874,5,2018-12-02T01:14:31.000Z,tmsirena,Love Baby Center,This app is a great place to start for welcoming your baby into the world. From start to finish I spend less time reading about my symptoms and more time asking women who are in the same state as me about my symptoms! There‚Äôs also all kinds of tools like the kick tracker and daily reminders to help you stay on track. I highly recommend this app!!
875,875,4,2018-12-10T02:15:57.000Z,Persephoney86,Frequently logs out and doesn‚Äôt allow you to log back in,"This is probably my favorite pregnancy app, I have two others, but one issue is making me very unhappy with this app. The app frequently will for some reason sign out, and when I try to sign back in it says that account doesn‚Äôt exist. A day later it is usually back to normal, but until it fixes itself I can‚Äôt use the app."

This app is amazing and I will use this app for my next pregnancy and also recommend this app to every new mom. Thanks BabyCenter ‚ù§Ô∏è
878,878,4,2019-01-20T13:59:53.000Z,ashleyalexia99,Favorite app so far,"Very simple and easy to use. I enjoy the step by step illustration of my pregnancy and the amazing animated videos they create to show and explain the stages of pregnancy. It‚Äôs a lot of information to take in at once for a new mom so I appreciate the fact that it‚Äôs step by step, and comes with all of the helpful tips you could possibly think of- whether for nutrition, medical needs, social needs, etc"
879,879,5,2019-02-05T18:46:30.000Z,danislaff,On point,This app has just about anything and everything you could think of. I love reading the suggested articles and they almost always correlate to what I‚Äôm going through at that time with baby. And I enjoy seeing the Anonymous polls and being able to type and look things up as well. Great app! Would recommend.
880,880,5,2017-08-09T15:07:19.000Z,Tkuns,Best pregnancy app,I love everything about this app. It's made my pregnancy even more fun with all the information it provides along with letting me know how my babies grow week to week. You can ask questions to other Momma's and read questions that other people have asked and had answered. I check it every day and love it more and more!
881,881,3,2018-03-09T11:53:02.000Z,ailith5048,Glitches,"The app is great but it glitches horribly when navigating the forums. Frequently, it will freeze while loading and you‚Äôre left with a blank white page, and other times the forum shows the same 3-4 posts repeatedly listed multiple times in a row as you scroll down the forum. It really is quite aggravating I have to close out the app and restart it every time it freezes or crashes (about every 5 or so minutes)."
882,882,2,2018-05-11T17:46:55.000Z,cassidi,If you‚Äôre getting this app to connect with others- DON‚ÄôT,"The birth month groups are honestly littered with trolls and snarky, negative participants with way too much time on their hands. The mods don‚Äôt do anything about participants treating other disrespectfully and ridiculing people who ask questions. You will NOT get the support you are looking for through BabyCenter."
883,883,5,2021-04-27T20:33:56.000Z,odd12344,Best app to use during pregnancy and child care,"Best app for a new time mother like myself. I learned so much during while I was pregnant with my first born. I was so nervous about how to take care of a baby and this app provides so much information. After my son was born, I still use this app to read about his developmental milestones and other articles as well. Wonderful app!"
884,884,4,2021-07-12T16:21:42.000Z,Midnightmares93,Great app!,"The baby center app has a fantastic layout that easy to read and suggests articles and facts that are appropriately timed during pregnancy as well as when your child grows. There is a little discrepancy between the day that each new week cycles depending on whether your looking at the app or the email notification, but it‚Äôs not a super big deal. Definitely would recommend to other moms and dads."

What I like most about it, is that it will send you chats with other moms that had kids around the same time you did to talk about stuff you might be going through with your kids."

This is very frustrating and I often just give up watching the videos or reading the articles which is a shame because they do provide very good information"

This app has great articles and helps keep track of your trimesters with informative updates on the baby‚Äôs growth over the weeks. It‚Äôs helped me be a bit more informed than just searching around on the Internet. I‚Äôve really been enjoying it."

Customer service apologized, but said there was nothing they could do to retrieve them. How horrible to offer this and not protect the data or have it properly stored. If I would have known my pictures wouldn‚Äôt be safe I would have never used this app. Luckily I had some pictures on my phone, but I am missing weeks and all my notes are gone."

It also connects you with a group of women whose babies are due within the same month as yours. You can talk to these women, encourage each other and share info. It gives awesome advice, has videos, teachings, and things to help prepare you for the big day.  I love this app"

897,897,5,2019-06-04T16:16:40.000Z,GuitarMaster1,Absolutely love this app!,I would say this app is about 98% always on point if not higher. I compare this app to actual appointments I go to and it‚Äôs amazing how extremely close this app is to your pregnancy. Of course everyone‚Äôs situation with pregnancy is different that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt give it 100% on my personal feedback. I love it tho it makes everything so easy!

My baby is already 2 months now and I still use the app to track his growth and they still sending me reading about how the baby‚Äôs growing and my body after birth. I really love this app"
899,899,5,2019-09-14T01:50:06.000Z,kped98,Helpful,Instead of google (which I TRY to avoid) if I have silly questions or weird things I will go on the baby center app to see the forums or articles about other women. I have found it very helpful knowing what‚Äôs changing in your body each week. I still remember downloading the app when I was in the ‚Äúpoppy seed‚Äù week and now I‚Äôm 31 weeks. Enjoy!
900,900,4,2017-08-15T23:09:03.000Z,WagnerWagner,Fun and useful,"I used this app all during pregnancy and it was a great way to keep track of the changes with the baby and myself! Only problem was that it would freeze every now and then, and wouldn't update to the current day. The tools like the contraction timer were helpful, but the others not so much. I wish there was more info geared toward at home/birth center births; Not everyone uses a hospital."
901,901,5,2017-08-26T17:22:22.000Z,txtisha,Love it!,I love getting my weekly update on my little man's progress! I get to keep track of my growing belly with my bumpies and i am always able to find answers to my questions about how I'm feeling. I like to be able to see how other mothers are dealing with pregnancy also. I've used BabyCenter to track all 3 of my pregnancies and the app just made it easier.

I used it with my first pregnancy seven years ago and was happy to rejoin this time. However, the mobile app is extremely glitchy. I can‚Äôt load posts on the birth board, and when I try to comment or post, the keyboard freezes up and it takes me ten minutes or more to type a short paragraph, and sometimes it crashes before I can even post it. I cannot participate in the community because of the poor quality of the app on iPhone. I am so disappointed because I really enjoyed it before."
904,904,5,2018-04-26T13:35:23.000Z,da1Nonly007,Baby app is amazing,"This app gives me some sort of relieve as a first time dad. It tells me step by step what to expect. Yes, every baby is different but it‚Äôs a good feeling to know what‚Äôs coming your way and how your baby is changing or if your baby is falling behind on certain things so you can bring it up to the doctors and get a professional opinion. I love the app!"

During our first pregnancy it was nice to know what was going on as a first time father. This second time around it‚Äôs still just as great but I have a bit of experience this time.

913,913,5,2020-12-24T15:42:43.000Z,abigailcunnane,Fabulous and Informative,The fruits/veggies size comparisons are accurate. The app provides great information and pictures of how the baby looks in the womb with details week-by-week! Also provides illustrations of how big the baby looks in comparison to the body week-by-week. This app is by far my favorite that I‚Äôve used during my pregnancy.

This app provide a good platform for moms to learn about developmental phases and what to expect in future weeks.

It‚Äôs been the best app for pregnancy and baby up until the most recent update. YIKES! It‚Äôs so buggy, it‚Äôs almost unusable. Can‚Äôt click on links, sometimes pages show up without content, and the user experience is actually worse and less attractive. Not sure why it wasn‚Äôt tested before the release because it‚Äôs awful. Such a bummer."

It keeps you on track with what to expect at doctor‚Äôs visits and even after baby is born it helps ease your anxious mind with constant facts and tips that are perfect for the age of your baby. The little community blogs let you know you‚Äôre not crazy by reading about other moms going through the same things as you. Great Job!

I was wrong and this is not a great place to share productive conversations with other intelligent moms. This is a good community if you want to complain about some of the challenges of being a mom, brag about things like your body after baby, or ask questions that you could‚Äôve just Googled (or call your doc) to get way better advice faster."

934,934,5,2021-07-26T15:21:19.000Z,angelface1007,Great!!! Soo useful!!,I just started using this app after a few friends of mine suggested it. I find myself going down rabbit holes of information that are really useful and engaging. There‚Äôs so much information to digest and this app really helps not to overwhelm me and let me read what I feel like reading that‚Äôs relevant to where I am in my journey. Really like it so far!

I love that it gives you weekly development updates. Plus is has the bumpies for when you are pregnant and you can make cute pictures once you baby is born also.
939,939,4,2021-02-03T18:51:10.000Z,Weight freak,Awesome app,"Awesome App. Only reason I give a 4 star is because of one recommendation. Some of the information should be given earlier rather than later. Specifically I refer to breastfeeding. My experiences seemed to have been ahead of the information I was getting from the app. Example, when I was getting I do in what to expect, I had already experienced it and I wished I had gotten that information prior."

I don‚Äôt have a mother to guide me or anyone helping me through it but this app helps me keep track of my baby and my symptoms it lets me know what‚Äôs coming so I know it is okay.

They‚Äôve revamped it to be (I guess) more digestible but their content is now sorely lacking.  They used to have such a wealth of information compared to The Bump which made it feel like a more reliable on the subject matter.  Now with the distilled down information,  it‚Äôs sorely lacking information comparatively and feels like a crappy knock off of The Bump."
944,944,5,2020-11-08T17:34:20.000Z,IsaacAngelMar,Extremely helpful App,"This is an excellent app. I am in love with it because there is a lot of advice, Tips and information that I need . Instead of calling the doctor first , I read about it on here and have a better understanding of what is going on . Then I call if I need further info . So thank you Baby Center for helping me with my little ones ."
945,945,5,2020-09-11T17:43:34.000Z,kalyanikm,BabyJay,I love this App. I have been using it since my pregnancy and continuing even now after my baby is born. This is an amazing app and it is very very helpful for the new mom. I used to read it almost every alternate day and the information and videos provided are very clear. I recommend this App to every mom to be.
946,946,5,2020-07-17T04:48:24.000Z,BRod1982,Awesome app!!,I used this app throughout my pregnancy and I still log in to check once a week. I love this app. It gives so much good information. You can search for information or read some of the many articles they have. It gives you recommendations on articles to read based on the age of your child. It‚Äôs perfect.
947,947,5,2020-05-18T10:49:22.000Z,Miiiic 15,Love this app,I downloaded this app literally 5 minutes after I found out I was pregnant. I have looked at it just about every single day since. I‚Äôm 19 weeks now and I continue to love it. The information is great! It‚Äôs easy to use. And I always look forward to learning new stuff from it. I‚Äôm a first time mom so I find it extremely helpful!!!
948,948,1,2020-06-21T08:18:52.000Z,BAD update features,Update is terrible,"I loved this app about 1-2 years ago and would refer to it almost on a daily. Decided to download it again for my second child and now hate it. I have no idea how to navigate through it now and when I do open it, ads pop up more than anything and I don‚Äôt know how to leave those pages. There is not ‚Äúhome‚Äù page anymore and I kept scrolling and clicking on different items to finally get to what I wanted- the general description of what happens during this week in a baby‚Äôs life. Would not recommend this app anymore."
949,949,5,2019-12-20T18:09:18.000Z,SugaBabyBee,Awesome,"Baby center is such an awesome app. I love it so much, I used it throughout pregnancy and now that my little one is growing, it is still so helpful ‚ô•Ô∏è it keeps it with all my little ones progress and always has an article for any of my new mom questions. It is definitely and five star app and I would recommend it to any mom with children of any age!"
950,950,5,2018-08-30T13:06:48.000Z,Fnyguy,Has been such a relief to have guidance through this pregnancy,This app is amazing. You get daily information and weekly updates on your babies progress. Along with community boards to ask questions or find the question has already been asked and answered. This app has really given me peace of mind during this pregnancy.
951,951,5,2018-10-03T03:49:09.000Z,Susan Ashouri,Best Pregnancy App,Seriously I am on my third pregnancy and the second I found out I went and got the baby center app because it‚Äôs AMAZING!!! They are so accurate on everything and I love the community of women that share the same birth months as you do. They also send email updates of your babies growth each week and it makes me so happy to read.
952,952,5,2018-10-15T17:13:27.000Z,amaizygrace,The most informative app!,"I have used the babycenter app ever since I found out that I was pregnant. It gave me amazing week by week tips and info. My child is now 8 months and I still turn to babycenter for all of my questions! This app provides all of the information, completely non biased, and allows me as a mother to create my own opinion."
953,953,5,2019-04-30T23:12:47.000Z,aminasmommy,Absolutely amazing,"You be used this app ever since I found out I was pregnant at 8 weeks. It‚Äôs helped me through understanding her development, introduced me to related articles concerning any questions, and awesome tips and tricks for pre and post natal care."
954,954,3,2019-06-06T10:43:33.000Z,berickson651,Weird,"Like it other than the way it dates the pregnancy. Every OB I‚Äôve ever been with counts days from 6 weeks to 6+6, then on the next day you go to 7 weeks. For some reason this starts with 6+1 and goes to 6+7, which is very weird. So when you go to the Dr and they give you the size of your baby and your weeks along you always have to remember you will be off a day from the app because the week starts at +1 rather than 0. Please fix!"
955,955,5,2019-11-08T04:52:00.000Z,KrystalLom,Very helpful app!,"I used this app from the moment when I found out I was pregnant to now graduating from it as my son has turned 1! It was very convenient and always informative on things I had questions about and even on topics I never even thought of. Would highly recommend to all new moms, especially first time moms!"
956,956,5,2019-07-10T00:40:55.000Z,Kikoperico21,Great app to be informed as to what to expect,"Throughout my pregnancy I found all the information very useful, it gave me an idea of what I should expect, experience , the layout was very clear and easy to navigate through. Definitely recommend it to any mom or dad that wants to be informed as to what‚Äôs normal, should be happening or the progress of your baby."
957,957,1,2019-11-02T17:03:23.000Z,123sssjj543,Cyber bullying,"I ended up deleting the app because I was being bullied and attacked just for asking for opinions it‚Äôs crazy how mean grown women can be for no reason I don‚Äôt need that kinda of negativity especially when it‚Äôs supposed to be a happy time. Pretty sure the bullies are either men or women who are jealous of pregnant women because they can‚Äôt get pregnant, they had a whole thread of just making fun of everything everyone posted and they were very immature and yet I called them out on being mean and my comment gets deleted? Absolutely horrible I would not recommend this app to anybody"
958,958,4,2019-10-17T23:21:48.000Z,Nattybeeeeeeee,I love this app!,"One thing I didn‚Äôt like was for my entire week 5 when I would go to the app, it would open with some Miscarriage article. I hated that! So I avoided the app for like the last 3 days and went back on when I hit 6 weeks and it‚Äôs been great! Lots of information and links to additional info. I also like how they send emails about your progress and offers on baby items."
959,959,5,2019-07-03T15:43:09.000Z,Beth Wilhoite,Very helpful!!,I don‚Äôt have a spectacular relationship with my mom during this time so this app has been really helpful and really informative on the questions I have and need answered or helped me know that certain things are normal. Like nose bleeds. Every week we call baby girl by whatever veggie size she‚Äôs compared to and it makes it fun. I really like this app :)
960,960,5,2018-05-13T07:37:12.000Z,destinybaby#1,Love it!!,"This app is very informational, it gives great advice to help keep moms and moms to be on track. I‚Äôm personally a mom to be and didn‚Äôt know a lot about having a healthy body and baby. I learn so much from this app I feel like a pro at this, and I honestly got more information from this app then my doctor and midwife. This is definitely my go to app everyday, I love it!!!"
961,961,5,2018-05-30T17:37:49.000Z,B-Arvz,"Love this app, the best app ever","Helps me a lot with my pregnancy I learn a lot of stuff for my pregnancy, help me a lot with my baby now is the best app for parents that‚Äôs wants the best for their kids, I know people said having a baby don‚Äôt come with instructions but this app will help a LOT is almost everything you need to know. Is an awesome app the best I try o lot and this one is just all I need"
962,962,2,2018-06-09T18:50:38.000Z,Phil87647,Ok but better ones out there,"I used the app during my first pregnancy a few years ago and had good memories, but this time it seems to have changed a lot and is much worse than before. Many more articles about new things to worry about in case you didn‚Äôt have enough already, lists of stuff to buy, etc. I thought there were some good videos before but maybe that was another app, in any case there aren‚Äôt any now. There are better apps out there if you look a bit."
963,963,4,2018-07-02T13:09:16.000Z,TQ9025,Very helpful,A lot of great information that is creditable and helps you keep up with how far along you are and then how old your baby is and what they should be doing. Only reason I gave it four stars is because they would send me an email in which I was able to log into my account but then when I switched to the app it would try to make me register as a new user.
964,964,5,2021-08-24T14:51:47.000Z,elita916,New Mama,Loving the information and details this app provides. Just imagine how many women never had this kind of help and information at their fingertips! This app helps me understand my body and share this information with my husband so he can understand what I‚Äôm experiencing. Really helps us stay bonded through the experience.
965,965,5,2021-07-08T21:38:49.000Z,Osomama102,Now on second baby,"Redownloaded this app because I loved how it helped me keep tabs on my first baby, provided me with so much useful info, compiled all my baby bumps in order (which turned into a mini video), and let me see how my baby is developing depending on the weeks. I never take the time to make a review but this app is very helpful for any expectant momma."
966,966,5,2021-05-09T17:26:14.000Z,Leslie and Sarah Frances,Amazing app,This app is part of my daily life. I read it everyday and it walks with me through my journey. I enjoy it so much and love the articles it provides. Great information and my favorite part is the weekly update on what size my baby is in relation to everyday food items. It‚Äôs so interesting to see the comparison. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.
967,967,5,2021-04-08T11:49:13.000Z,Moobabyyy,Best Pregnancy/ Parenting App,I am currently using this for my 3rd pregnancy. I used it for both my previous pregnancies and for when they were babies. Love this app because it gives great advise while pregnant and also helpful insights on newborns and toddlers. There‚Äôs also very helpful videos that teach about your changing body while pregnant and about labor and delivery.
968,968,5,2021-04-07T05:55:04.000Z,@jmal,A must have for every new parent.,"I was sceptical at using this app first but after 1 month of using and looking at all the age specific information I was amazed at how much I rely on this app. I have been using this app everyday for 40 weeks and now that our baby is here, I still refer baby center for all my queries and questions."
969,969,5,2021-02-28T15:36:38.000Z,p.l.on,A bible for new moms,The topics are thoughtful and varied with answers to almost every question. High quality videos about baby development are entertaining and visually stunning.

I look forward to the upcoming week to see what‚Äôs new in baby boys developing life. Makes me feel so much closer to him. I‚Äôve downloaded many other apps but this one has by far been my favorite. Highly recommended!

Weekly development updates, sizes, articles to read, kick tracker, bump picture that converts it to a video, information on what‚Äôs safe to do/eat or not, registry checklist, baby name ideas, birth class information, birth plan, and contraction timer.

The app does amazing giving very detail updates on the babys growth . I love this app and read it daily .
973,973,5,2020-11-13T12:44:46.000Z,acsatermo,Sooo helpful!,"This app has taught me about each week in my pregnancy and has continued to teach me things each week as my baby grows. I thought it would stop at birth and I‚Äôm so glad it doesn‚Äôt! It helps me make sure my little one is in track for her milestones. Plus if you have a question, you can ask all of the moms on the forums, it‚Äôs so great!"
974,974,5,2020-05-16T03:46:58.000Z,COURTNEYMAEMAE,Awesome,This app gives you guidance shows very good diagrams and images of your growing baby and gets you connected with other mothers through the community its great to get your questions answered! I‚Äôve used this handy app with both of my babies one in 2018 and the newest in 2020 was extremely helpful and informative both times! Thanks babycenter üíïüíô
975,975,5,2020-02-14T19:43:52.000Z,Jenica1441,Love this app,"It‚Äôs the best app I‚Äôve used. I‚Äôve used it throughout my pregnancy and the information is so helpful. This app gives you so many resources and tips, which especially are helpful with becoming a new mom. This app can help you from registering online to choosing your little bundle of joys name! Incredibly useful!!!! A must have as a new or expecting parent."
976,976,5,2020-01-22T15:48:25.000Z,MamaSrose,Love!,"I love the app! I like that it sends me little updates on my baby‚Äôs development for his age. I like all of the articles that are relevant to his current age group also. I think it would be nice to add milestones that should baby should be approaching. Overall, I love this app. I‚Äôve tried others throughout my pregnancy and this is the only one I still actively use."
977,977,1,2020-02-11T20:47:09.000Z,appreviewerprofile7777,"App crashes, poorly moderated community and they sell your info",App crashes. They sell your info- not real comforting reminder of the anniversary of a miscarriage to get a bunch of formula and other freebies when the only place that had your original due date was babycenter.
978,978,2,2020-01-24T22:44:57.000Z,xALMONDx,The Group Threads are NOT for me.,The app itself seemed decent. The group threads are horrible. I already have anxiety and the threads literally made it worse. There are entirely too many women speaking on miscarries and trying to ‚Äúdiagnose‚Äù others of possibly having miscarriages. I tried to ignore it all but then I would get a daily summary of the threads to my email and THEN the same article popped up twice about dealing with miscarriage. I felt like the overall experience was scarring life out of me rather than celebrating life growing in me. The whole app had to go.
979,979,5,2019-09-11T16:59:49.000Z,KJ671KJ,Awesome app,Love the updates I get every week. I didn‚Äôt know that the app also gives you updates after birth and explains different things that happen during every week of their lives... it has helped me a lot with tips and tricks and to have a better understanding of what‚Äôs going on with my newborn. This first time mama loves this app!!!
980,980,5,2018-12-12T16:18:16.000Z,lycorysh,Very informative info when in need,I love this website/app. It was referred to me from a co worker after finding out I was pregnant. I have retained so so much helpful information from what foods I shouldn‚Äôt eat during pregnancy all the way to what activities to do with my now 3mos old twin girls. Thanks BabyCenter you helped in so many & was my life saver and still is to this day!
981,981,5,2019-01-11T21:58:25.000Z,Pocfit,I Love baby Center app!!,"I found this app when I was a month into my pregnancy and have used it ever since. It gives you guidance the whole step of the way and connects you to other mommies who are in the same boat so you know you‚Äôre not alone. And it continues after pregnancy to be an amazing source of great information, encouragement and help."
982,982,5,2019-01-15T16:02:45.000Z,audreymodica,My favorite baby app!,"In my experience as a first time mom, baby center reads my mind! If something happens or if I feel a certain way, I am reading about it the next day on my app. My questions get answered without having to get lost in the Black hole of google. It‚Äôs been very helpful so far and doesn‚Äôt fill your head with unnecessary worry!"
983,983,5,2019-01-20T20:16:21.000Z,BMP26,Great App,"This app has been so helpful! I look forward to reading updates each week. It was exciting to read about how our baby was developing while pregnant, and now it‚Äôs comforting reading about important milestones now that our little one is here. I‚Äôve turned to this app time and time again for helpful tips and advice. It‚Äôs great!"
984,984,5,2019-03-20T16:06:26.000Z,aaricad,Great App Overall!,Very informative & provides a lot of support. Only thing I‚Äôd suggest to the developers is that the app should call the baby ‚Äúher‚Äù or ‚Äúhim‚Äù depending on what the individual says they‚Äôre having when they sign up for the app.
985,985,5,2019-05-21T14:14:38.000Z,Kelly Melvine,"Thankful,","I remember when I was pregnant I use to check the baby center like 10times a day just to make sure if what was happening to me was normal. I am a 1st time mum and the baby center really helped me through my pregnancy. My baby is 8months now and I still use it. Thank you so much!! I am pretty sure a lot of mummies out there feels the same way, but mostly 1st time Mothers."
986,986,5,2019-09-07T11:19:26.000Z,mrsbridges1719,Amazing App,This app is amazing. At first I thought it was just going to be another dumb app that Facebook or other apps advertise but I downloaded it and it‚Äôs so helpful and useful.

989,989,4,2019-07-08T13:05:06.000Z,MamaMari97,Love this app!,I love opening this app and always seeing something new and all the information they have to share about everything pregnancy! The one thing I would change is how the compare the size of the fetus every week to odd vegetables and fruits that I‚Äôve never seen or heard of. It prevents me from comparing it to something I have locally and makes me guess the size of my baby even more.
990,990,5,2017-08-28T19:56:21.000Z,GotYouFizzedout,The perfect app,"I have been using this app from the moment I found out I was pregnant. My daughter is turning one in a few days and this app has been my guide through parenting, with this being my first child and everything.

Connect with others who are TTC, having their TWW, or dealing with the same symptoms or hardships you are.

993,993,5,2018-01-30T17:43:36.000Z,Rissa Wood,Very useful,Ever since I found out I was expecting I‚Äôve had this app. It‚Äôs so helpful with any questions and gives great advice. It prepares you on what to expect and to think ahead. It‚Äôs also great if you have any questions or concerns or just want others opinions on what to name your baby you can ask other expected mothers.  Great app all around!!
994,994,1,2018-02-09T16:50:36.000Z,~*ASHLEY*~,So disappointed,Use to love taking bumpies on this app but now I‚Äôve lost them all because my phone decided to factory reset and i lost all my pics on my phone but I was relieved that I believed having the app it would at least save my bumpies to the app but nope I was wrong. What‚Äôs the point in having the app if it‚Äôs not going to save my pics to the app? Also it won‚Äôt save my babies birthdate so I can‚Äôt get any updates on my babies growth. It‚Äôs just stuck on me being ‚Äú40 weeks‚Äù. I‚Äôm so disappointed that I lost all of my bumpies and can‚Äôt even get updates on my son month to month.

You need this, trust me."

I went back and used it again with me second pregnancy and was just as pleased the second time! I especially love how they share information tailored to the milestones my kids are reaching. It‚Äôs like they can read my mind!

The daily information especially the videos that were shared with me  were very interesting. The only problem I have had was not being able to login quickly because it was asking to have me reset my password all the time even in one day.
1007,1007,5,2020-11-07T21:34:01.000Z,ShayHeyy00,I love it,This app has been more than helpful during my pregnancy. Being able to learn how my baby develops each week was intriguing. And having the forums to communicate with other women made me feel less alone or worried to know I'm not the only one who goes through certain things.  I highly recommend this app.

I also have Ovia and Flo downloaded and this one is by far my favorite. The interface is simple and I love the way the ‚Äúfeed‚Äù is set up! The articles are very informative and I also love hearing the opinions/stories of other moms! This is the best app for pregnancy hands down. And I assume it‚Äôs the best for postpartum as well üòÅ

This app was also so helpful in sorting out all of the varying opinions out there on the internet which aren‚Äôt based on any facts or science."
1012,1012,4,2018-08-15T05:01:27.000Z,Griselle189,Excellent guide for new parents,"I can only say that I love it and it helps me as a new mother, the only detail is that they inform you until the year, they should update it and continue at least until 2 or 3 years, since the growth in these stages are very important to know them well as parents. (All the ages of our kids are important) but babies have to be taken care of very well for proper growth."
1013,1013,5,2018-11-19T06:05:58.000Z,FASHIONWILD3,Great just Great,This app gives a lot of Information you may have questions about.

1018,1018,5,2019-09-18T04:41:41.000Z,Atti8,Ugly logo..,I LOVE the app but the new logo with the dark blue is just so hideous.. it bothers me every time I look at it. The other tree with the bright cheery colors made it much more appealing and cute but the new one with the dark colors makes it so depressing and less ‚Äúchild like‚Äù.. I mean this is an app about babies why make it so dreary. Just had to let you know my opinion.. take care!
1019,1019,5,2019-07-03T06:38:06.000Z,Grgffgnuipohcchycbhgd,Love it,"Great articles. I‚Äôve had this app ever since I found out I was pregnant in March 2017 & it has daily info according to your baby‚Äôs age and how far along you are in your pregnancy.

1021,1021,3,2017-11-01T17:10:22.000Z,Scientist333,Birth Club Forum Needs Work,"In the app under the birth club tab, if you go to any page past the first one and then exit out of a forum, it immediately takes you back to the first page regardless of what page you were on. That‚Äôs extremely frustrating if you‚Äôve already browsed through the first 5 pages and accidentally exit out of a topic only to be taken back to the first page. This needs to be fixed."
1022,1022,5,2018-02-16T01:58:07.000Z,VivianCamly,Vivian,"I love it!:). This app saved my life, especially being a first time mom. I couldn‚Äôt do a good being a mom‚Äôs without its help!!

I don‚Äôt feel prepared at all. People tell me that‚Äôs normal, and that freaks me out even more! Apps like this have been very helpful and also reduces the anxiety, as it‚Äôs a great source of info, not only for the baby, but also for me to support my partner better."
1026,1026,5,2021-08-29T12:25:45.000Z,FeLeMichelleh,This app has been a bit help honestly,"There are hundreds of apps that tell you week to week updates , but with this one The best part is the community.

The app provided me with daily, Weekly and monthly information about baby growth, mother‚Äôs symptoms, believed it was a great deal of help without having to freak out or call my doctor ASAP."
1028,1028,1,2021-07-26T03:55:10.000Z,MadMomma69,Soooo ANGRY,This app CONSTANTLY deletes the bump pics that I have taken and uploaded. I take them and add a caption each week. This app has DELETED my precious pictures week after week. Randomly choosing which ones to delete and when. Never bringing them back. Beyond angry and disappointed in this app for this. Come on. Fix the glitch. You are ruining pregnancy keepsakes and memories. Does NOT work as described. I have a brand new iPhone that is completely updated. It is the app. I‚Äôve tried it from my own phone and my partners. This is ridiculous. Super dissatisfied customer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1029,1029,4,2021-05-18T14:13:49.000Z,JDavis6,Great,The app is great as it provides updates to your pregnancy. It also provides great information and tips during pregnancy. The only problem I‚Äôve experienced is that the mobile app doesn‚Äôt seem to be up to date. Some functions aren‚Äôt available via mobile app as it is on the website. I love this app but would recommend more updates to the app
1030,1030,5,2021-04-16T05:57:07.000Z,Raceboi808,Very informative & accurate!,There‚Äôs so much information on this app it really amazes me! I love how there‚Äôs even clubs too!

It helps my littles to understand what is going on and helps me to not seem crazy when I‚Äôm complaining about something that pops up as a symptom!  Then I start to get a little more sympathy.
1034,1034,5,2021-01-16T19:39:30.000Z,Jerline P,Great!,I love this app it has so much information and the info is always on point. I also like how this is a community to get together with other moms who can also share experiences and give advice to help one another. Another thing I like is that you can document Milestones and share you‚Äôre happy moments. Overall this app is awesome!
1035,1035,3,2021-02-27T22:17:30.000Z,Lezbehonestyo,Latest update is terrible,"I enjoyed using the birth club portion of the app to feel connected to other moms. The latest update has made navigating it SO annoying. You click on a post and if you go back to the main posting page, it has to reload everything and you‚Äôre back at the top. There‚Äôs also so much lag! Overall the birth club is awesome, I just don‚Äôt understand the update...it only made things worse."

No one has a twin option and it‚Äôs really sad. I wish so much there was more information about it. How they are growing together. All of the great things for singleton babies. We have 2 times the anxiety, two times the hormones and no one is addressing it. It‚Äôs unfortunate."
1040,1040,5,2020-12-23T12:15:59.000Z,Italian Mystic,Awesome community,Love connecting to other expecting moms that are due the same month as me. We can relate during each week and all stages.

1057,1057,1,2019-12-14T22:43:40.000Z,ftkbdarh,To much bullying from other expectant moms,Don‚Äôt bother posting your questions and especially photos that you seriously need answered. These several expectant moms that are highly rude and judgemental towards others. It‚Äôs like a forum with a group of teens. You can report the rude comments but nothing will be down. As you go on to read other people‚Äôs post you find the same individuals bullying those posters as well. It‚Äôs really ridiculous. Just find somewhere else to post your questions or feeds because it‚Äôs totally not worth it and baby center condones the drama.

I enjoy seeing updates updates and being able to keep track of things before and after pregnancy‚Ä¶ I look forward to being able to know where I would be or to be able to go back and reread some of the things that I may have missed help me conceive!!!!
1072,1072,4,2021-01-11T15:51:07.000Z,Very Disatisfed Customer,Lots of good information!,This app has a lot of good articles to read throughout your pregnancy that has been reviewed or written by experts.
1073,1073,5,2020-11-13T13:09:25.000Z,Queen Tont,Love the app!,Love this app! Pregnancy varies from woman to woman with each pregnancy you have but Baby Center really is helpful and I love reading what my baby this week is doing and the fact that they keep up with your weeks üòÅüòÅ I used this app with first baby and I'm using it with this baby too. The app also keeps up with baby after birth!
1074,1074,5,2020-11-12T13:13:44.000Z,Jess h87,Such a useful and helpful app,"I go to baby center for many questions, concerns and just to learn about my child‚Äôs development or milestones. Even being a second time mom i still find myself referring to the articles within. Thanks Baby Center for doing all that you do, you truly support parents in an amazing way!"
1075,1075,5,2020-09-07T06:01:02.000Z,The biebsüíú,Best app ever!,I‚Äôm a first-time mommy and this app has been so helpful! It provides very clear pictures weekly of how your baby is developing and the changes going on inside your tummy. Absolutely fascinating!! Love how they send updates and keep you on track. This app changed my life during pregnancy! Would highly recommend downloading!
1076,1076,5,2020-03-31T18:11:13.000Z,irsasboaib,Higly recommended app,I have been using this for 2 years . I ised this app for my first pregnancy and allahumdullah using it for 2nd one too. Its amazing how it describe each n every little thing about baby and u. And suggestions and ideas that it gives to improvise it... love the app. Its my first time rating any app. But u ppl really deserve it.. thumbs up for ur hard work..!!
1077,1077,3,2020-04-05T22:46:02.000Z,LindssW,3 stars,Good for first time mommas that want to know what‚Äôs developing week by week as the pregnancy goes on. Also can add little bumpie pictures. Has a contraction timer which I‚Äôm sure would come in handy. I would just stay away from the birth club on there. A lot of moms on there with all very different opinions about things and people aren‚Äôt always the nicest. Will be finding a different app to use for the remainder of this pregnancy for that reason alone.
1078,1078,5,2020-03-31T00:30:23.000Z,alyssaacastro,L O V E !!!!,"Loved this app from the very beginning, when I first found out I was pregnant, and even till now, 5 months postpartum! It gives you the best tips for literally everything you could possibly think and stress over and it helps put your mind at ease. It grows with you and your baby which is what I love the most! Definitely recommend!"
1079,1079,2,2020-02-15T00:46:14.000Z,Jnai712,Rude people,"Overall I enjoyed the app for the most very helpful through my pregnancy. The groups however have some very rude people. I don‚Äôt agree with the things people get away with saying and when you call them out, they call it harassment. I think if some people weren‚Äôt strong enough to hear people comments it could destroy someone. I decided to delete this app due to people being very judgmental and not helpful. I suggest if you do join group be careful not to get sucked into people‚Äôs negativity!"
1080,1080,5,2019-01-14T03:36:05.000Z,Katt51,Great app!,"It would‚Äôve been nice to have exactly everything you need to know but I still give it 5 stars because some ppl don‚Äôt have parents or 24/7 doctor to help you with questions you have or information you would like to know or should know. This app is very helpful, useful and just great to have."
1081,1081,5,2019-04-09T19:54:05.000Z,BlackBonnieüñ§üß∏,Baby Center App,"I love this app!! I‚Äôve had it since I was 5 weeks pregnant (my first pregnancy). It‚Äôs so informational, helps me become more knowledgeable towards growing babies. The layout is simple and easy to use and it‚Äôs freeüòâ! I highly recommend this app!! Especially for first time mothers or even if you just want to know more ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÇ. All in all, I rate this app all 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è!"
1082,1082,5,2019-04-16T02:09:11.000Z,shrodeb,Great resource,Baby center is so knowledge and fun! They have answers to many questions or concerns you may have as well as a way to communicate with other moms. You'll be able to enjoy the excitement of knowing what is changing with you and your baby through each week and what to expect. Overall a great app and resource.
1083,1083,5,2019-05-25T15:45:50.000Z,Mary YC,Mary YC,I really like this app!  It notifies me week by week when I progress in my pregnancy and I love the informational videos provided.  I feel like it‚Äôs a helpful and simple app that isn‚Äôt overwhelming with information.  I also like the surveys because it helps me see what other women are saying about their pregnancies.  I recommended this app to another mama to be.
1084,1084,5,2020-01-15T19:20:08.000Z,Alton's Mommy,"Love, One Suggestion though!",I Loooooovveeeeeee this App! I‚Äôve been using it since I discovered my pregnancy... It helped me understand and visualize my body and it‚Äôs changes as well as my baby‚Äôs changes every step of the way! It also has helpful tips to help mommy understand baby and his actions and emotions after birth... I‚Äôd recommend this app to anybody!
1085,1085,5,2020-01-13T14:31:01.000Z,Shrutig17,Amazing app,"I am using this app for second time for my second baby. This is a complete app, you really don‚Äôt need anything after this. From pregnancy to baby then toddler to big kids, it has got you covered. Everything you need to know about kid‚Äôs growth, what they should eat, how they will behave, you can clear all your doubts here."
1086,1086,5,2019-12-17T22:42:09.000Z,Mamunsky,Great app,I love this app! It‚Äôs been so exciting to watch my baby grow and know that anything I feel is normal and that other moms feel the same way. The only thing with the app is that it sometimes logs me out but it‚Äôs not that bothersome when I get to see how big my baby is getting. I highly recommend this app. It‚Äôs so cute and useful.
1087,1087,5,2019-09-04T07:19:32.000Z,Shelbysnazz,I use this app everyday,"This app has been my first go to tool for my pregnancy. This is my first baby and I haven‚Äôt really had many pregnant friends, so this has been an awesome source for me. I check the different articles almost daily and always look at the weekly updates. 10/10 would recommend!"
1088,1088,5,2019-06-29T18:47:40.000Z,StyleMamaüòä,Great App,"Yeah this app is amazing , tells me every single detail that I need to know about my developing baby."
1089,1089,1,2019-08-26T09:43:40.000Z,mommybitch,Birth club community,So I‚Äôm new to all this and I just typed like a really long post about what‚Äôs been going on and needing advice and when I pressed create post it deleted everything! My post isn‚Äôt there and I‚Äôve literally been typing and crying for like an hour. This is supposed to be where we can get support and stuff for what‚Äôs going on this thing just deletes it. I feel bad enough and now I feel like it‚Äôs not even worth posting. I have no real people to care so why would a bunch of strangers online care? Thanks BabyCenter. Way to push someone over the edge.
1090,1090,5,2017-10-08T15:19:32.000Z,Aatran21,Best App,"There are a lot of pregnancy apps out there. This one is by far the best one so far . Easy to use and navigate around, my wife and I love it. We used it throughout the whole pregnancy and it was so helpful during the scary times to get information. Now we have a healthy baby boy. I just wish it gave us sleep and it would be perfect"
1091,1091,3,2017-11-21T23:43:29.000Z,SereneSerpentine,Too Glitchy,The app barely works anymore. Sometimes the menu to go between the weeks and the forums for example doesn‚Äôt load.
1092,1092,5,2017-11-26T21:05:51.000Z,StarKushiro03,Information is a blessing!,"The amount of information is just AMAZING. I‚Äôve learned a lot, honestly! I would definitely recommend getting this app as soon as you become pregnant. It helps you to not be so nervous about the growing fetus... it makes it exciting. I love it so far! I am at 35 weeks 6 days pregnant with my first. Due December 26th. Hopefully she lasts that long.‚ù§Ô∏è"
1093,1093,2,2017-12-30T14:11:08.000Z,LinzorTorte85,Heteronormative,"I was excited to begin tracking my pregnancy but from my first encounter with this app I have been struck by how heteronormative it is. I started by completing the ""Am I pregnant?"" quiz and the first question was ""have you had sex since your last period?"". As a married lesbian using home insemination with a known donor I did not become pregnant by having sex. In fact, many straight women become pregnant through alternative methods these days. It's time to get with the times and update the app to reflect the diversity of pregnancy in 2018."
1094,1094,5,2018-02-09T04:58:38.000Z,PrisReyes,Love this app!,"This app helped me get through my first pregnancy by providing me with plenty of information. Being a first time mom can be overwhelming, as there is s lot to learn, however Baby Center always answered my questions and still is by providing me with week by week developmental tips for my infant. Love it and would recommend to all new moms!!!"
1095,1095,5,2018-02-15T18:51:03.000Z,Kali's mommy,First time mom,If your a first time mom or even if it's not your first child this app is the app to have because I found out everything that I needed to know when it came to my little gummy bear and if I wasn't sure about something this app provides you with the help you need to get the answer you were looking for...I LOVE IT
1096,1096,1,2018-03-13T13:27:51.000Z,dsx3,Glitches the company doesn‚Äôt seem to care,"Babycenter is a great resource in general to get information and connect with other moms going through similar things. With that said, the app glitches. It use to be very minimal, however still noticeable and now it leaves the app totally unusable. I have email them multiple times and moms are discussing it on the birth boards. The company seems in no rush to fix the problem. Deleting and redone loading doesn‚Äôt help. Now that people can‚Äôt use the app, the website crashes from the overuse. Very disappointed"
1097,1097,5,2018-09-04T19:37:17.000Z,Tay&Charles,Helps me a lot,Anytime I have a question I can look it up on here and it gives me some great tips/suggestions. I love reading about my pregnancy week by week and especially the ‚Äúbumpie‚Äù picture where you can upload pics of your belly every week to see progress in growth! My boyfriend and I both use this and love it :)
1098,1098,5,2018-09-06T02:22:38.000Z,CaitDonaldson,Love!,"I used the baby center app my whole pregnancy, and once I had my baby I was so sad at the thought that I would not get little notifications every week about my baby‚Äôs growth. But I logged on to it again to find out that I still get notifications and can use the app even after my baby was born! Love it!"
1099,1099,1,2018-10-23T05:43:01.000Z,mommietoaprincess2020,Weed out the negativity please,I never use this app anymore because when I first became pregnant I was literally ripped to shreds by some hateful women about a post saying I was depressed and not a thing was done. I couldn‚Äôt even remove my post to avoid the hateful comments!!! Please work on this because other than that I do like the app. The negative comments should be read and picked through and the people that post them should be banned. The actions from those people could have led me to suicide at the time I was already in such a depressed place. Thankfully I pulled through
1100,1100,5,2017-09-30T12:08:02.000Z,Kaley0718,New update isn't good,"I've been using this app for about two weeks and I have loved it. They just did an update that I did yesterday and now I can't even open it. I'm able to see a glimpse of it, before it crashes. I had such high hopes of being able to use this app because it has been so informative."
1101,1101,5,2021-07-13T16:04:29.000Z,Koungst,Great app!,Very informative and supportive! I love the birth chat feature. The pictures give good information without over doing it. The only thing I would fix is the Bump tool section. I wish you could change it from weeks to months. Other than that I couldn‚Äôt imagine a pregnancy without this app.
1102,1102,5,2021-06-25T17:27:37.000Z,Elizabeth Neu.,I love it!,"As a first timer to this whole pregnancy thing I always have 4 million questions roaming around my head. This app actually answers like 1/2 of those 4 million. Also, it‚Äôs just super cute when it compares what‚Äôs growing in me to fruits/beans! I love knowing what‚Äôs happening and I was recommended this by 2 friends, so this review is 3-in-1, we love you guys!"
1103,1103,5,2021-05-25T14:59:56.000Z,NNovaSStarLL,Love learning,I love getting email reminders of my child's growing stages it‚Äôs interesting to learn and read about the different milestones she might be going through as she grows. The information provided is great because it also provides you with helpful advice or links to other topics. I definitely recommend using this app.
1104,1104,5,2021-05-15T14:25:35.000Z,AnneMomofTwo,My Go-To for Baby Insight,"I‚Äôve been using this app for 3 years and I love it! It provided so much reassurance when my first child was little, and I came to rely on it for good and objective information. It also provides little snippets of sanity for us moms, and helps me feel normal during all of my ups and downs. There‚Äôs really so much good in this app. Gold star!"
1105,1105,5,2021-05-04T14:01:25.000Z,FreesiaCullen,Great!,"So far,  I love this app. It's like it has an answer for everything. Especially since I'll be a first time mom it helps me stay updated and learn new things that are important to know."
1106,1106,5,2021-04-24T18:57:34.000Z,CZtruth,Predictions were helpful!!,"There would be weeks when a new part of pregnancy would kick in, and this would be pretty close to when things would kick in, example, more energy, lower back pain, flutters, and such."
1107,1107,5,2021-03-19T21:33:20.000Z,Lilmamalb,Great app,"Loved it through out my pregnancy, all the little highlights were almost always spot on for me. Didn‚Äôt think i‚Äôs need the app after my baby was born and actually didnt use it for a couple months. But theres actually good things that you can look out for each month and the mommy group is fun"
1108,1108,5,2021-03-15T07:22:19.000Z,Mealiness,The most helpful & insightful baby tracking app by far!!!,"The most helpful & insightful baby tracking app by far!!! It includes so many beneficial & informational sources to better support me the entire way through every growth & step of my pregnancy. They‚Äôre so many perks tied up into one bundle of an app for free! I seriously love this app, I use it every day."
1109,1109,2,2021-03-01T18:11:29.000Z,Ethereal92,Stopped Working,"At first it was great, probably my favorite baby tracking app, until a certain point. Once I hit 29 weeks, the app stopped letting me open the Highlights, Baby Size, Your Baby, and Your Body sections. When I do open one, it gives me an indefinite loading screen (I one says and timed 10 minutes with no change before giving up). I‚Äôve tried updating the app, deleting and reinstalling, and using a different network/WiFi connection, but nothing changed."
1110,1110,5,2020-12-31T17:20:30.000Z,Interested Nana,Rating,"I have gone through childhood development with my own three children. With my grandchildren, it is  interesting to know where they are developmentally although I can‚Äôt see them every week or month. I am able to understand where they are and better communicate with my daughter."
1111,1111,4,2021-01-22T14:18:33.000Z,arianakeely,Review,The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a five star is because I feel like the videos need to have more information on the weekly updates. In a little bit more about what you were going to go through week by week or at least a general grouping of five weeks what will be going through. Other than that I love the way it‚Äôs set up it‚ÄôsGreat.
1112,1112,5,2020-12-12T02:12:01.000Z,Sarah Cepero,Best app out there!,This is the best app for tracking pregnancy and get thorough information about baby and toddlers‚Äô development. It has a lot of articles and resources. I have three boys and I‚Äôve used this app has been my go-to companion from the very start. It even has forums where you can vent and talk to other moms about anxieties or simply exchange advices.
1113,1113,5,2020-12-10T15:28:57.000Z,Nitalee2011,Very useful APP for the new parents,"From pregnancy to newborn baby parent, baby center always share the information which I need to know just the right time. It tracks the different stages of the pregnancy and the newborn baby health development everyday which help me remember the schedules. I am so happy to find this APP, it feels like my family consultant. Thanks."

1115,1115,5,2020-10-08T12:48:38.000Z,Organ_1685,Best pregnancy app,"This is hands down the best pregnancy app I have found, and I have tried several. I really appreciate that they refer to my child as a baby from the very beginning rather than a fetus that will become my baby; they still use the scientifically appropriate terms as well. Great info, fascinating videos, interesting advice. 5 stars!"
1116,1116,5,2020-07-24T03:45:52.000Z,Mendoza5710,In love,I really love this app so much I tried other apps but they didn‚Äôt really show you as much detail as this does throughout your pregnancy and then when you have your baby it has so many helpful tips i have followed so much advice from this app I completely love it and would recommend anyone to use it
1117,1117,5,2020-07-17T20:38:47.000Z,msddukes87,You never stop learning even if you‚Äôre a veteran!,Love this app! I always find answers to my questions. Not my first rodeo but after an eight year gap I feel like my second baby is my first. Still learning new techniques. Learning things I didn‚Äôt know. Love that they send me weekly emails of milestones he should be hitting. Overall very happy!
1118,1118,5,2020-05-16T17:59:04.000Z,Nettaruss,I love Baby Center,This site helps me to be a better parent. There was so much that I didn‚Äôt not know as it related to caring for my daughter. Each week the site gives me information on where my daughter should be based on her age and challenges that are common for her age group. So then I know how to focus my attention with her. So grateful!

Not to mention it also helps after the baby is born ."

It gave me all the info I need and it‚Äôs very user friendly (page display) so it‚Äôs easy to navigate and understand. Another plus is the added pointers and helpful tips that are offered related to the period you are in.
1121,1121,5,2019-05-30T20:41:18.000Z,Sniper.E.,Very in formative!,No Matter how dumb or uncommon my question is I know I can find an answer in this app! (Relating to Pregnancy) it also keeps track of my baby AFTER THEIR BIRTH! It‚Äôs sends tips on the best foods/snack to eat at their age!

Sometimes I‚Äôm going through things i don‚Äôt understand at a certain point of my pregnancy and I come in here and it explains it all as if it was meant for me. I LOVE this app and highly recommend it!

1125,1125,5,2019-10-09T13:17:11.000Z,ayb98,Baby center,I have used baby center with my first born and it was very helpful. It provide unique ways of telling you how big your baby is. Like one week me baby was the size of a blueberry then the next a lemon. It still keeps track of my first born as well as my second which is on the way. üòãüòã thank you baby center.
1126,1126,5,2019-09-28T18:03:24.000Z,Kmh7,"So helpful from conceiving, to pregnancy, to birth and beyond!","This app was so helpful for us. The articles were informative and the information about each stage of conception, pregnancy, birth, and beyond was so reassuring. The due date community was pretty terrible - full of unsupportive, just plain nasty members - but that‚Äôs not the fault of this app. Perhaps better moderatorship would help??"
1127,1127,5,2019-09-22T15:02:25.000Z,Yummytumtum,Love it,"The articles are short and the videos are cute so it‚Äôs easy to use, it‚Äôs not overwhelming with info that you have to sift through to get answers. I used it while pregnant and now with a newborn. The notifications that pop up are cool too as a little reminder of what‚Äôs going on. I use to the website too. Thanks!"
1128,1128,5,2019-09-16T12:07:20.000Z,Leaa127,Awesome,This is my first time being pregnant and I was very hesitant and have little to no knowledge what so ever . This app really helped me with knowledge and just making me comfortable through out the whole way. I love how other moms can interact and how we can see great deals on certain things we need to get. I just think this is over all a great app!
1129,1129,5,2019-07-08T21:34:45.000Z,kittychin,I feel sad when the App says ‚Äúyou‚Äôve graduated from this App‚Äù,"I forgot how I downloaded BabyCenter, but I‚Äôve always love using the app because it has so much information and most importantly the information are so reliable and I can trust!"
1130,1130,5,2017-10-02T00:23:32.000Z,Chelsie45!!,Love this app,This is my first baby and this app has been a wealth of information. I love the weekend updates that it sends me about the baby and that I can send them to my husband. There's so cool apps that this app has within it that have been useful. I'll definitely use this app in the future and I recommend it to any expecting momma!

Cute little facts about your little one and even classes to get you prepared. I can‚Äôt even begin to thank the person who made this app possible. I even have my birth preferences thanks to this app. Love this app!!"
1132,1132,2,2018-03-09T10:31:39.000Z,J2sav,Works more like a crappy website than an app,"The navigation is the worst I‚Äôve get seen in an app. Needs a complete revamp. It‚Äôs also extremely buggy all of a sudden. I‚Äôve had it for about 5 months and all of a sudden it hardly works enough to function. It keeps crashing, won‚Äôt load properly, won‚Äôt let me type in forums, and won‚Äôt scroll. Pretty much only good to track how far along you are. The forums right now are not working well enough for me to be able to use."

1135,1135,5,2018-11-04T15:23:36.000Z,AdriandJC,Our top source for baby news!,"Since I was a few weeks pregnant, my husband and I have turned to two sources to learn about our baby‚Äôs health the doctor and BabyCenter. Today, she is 7months old and we still rely on the research based articles and weekly updates. BabyCenter has been a key part of our parenting journey!"
1136,1136,5,2018-12-11T11:59:01.000Z,VictoriaKaye88,Awesome,"I downloaded when I first found out I was pregnant and loved it, didn‚Äôt realize it would also start tracking baby after birth. Every week/month there are answers to questions I think of that relates to baby. Great app and use sometimes every day. I also love the weight/height/head circumference chart."
1137,1137,5,2018-12-13T20:48:24.000Z,Edge&E,Awesome App,Sometime I feel this app is reading my mind. I can think of a concern and the next day I‚Äôll receive a newsletter in my in box making reference to what ever concern I was having. I‚Äôm a geeky first time mom who will goggle any and every thing. This app has brought me peace when I‚Äôm concerned and joy with sharing my baby updates. Highly recommend!!!
1138,1138,5,2019-01-30T23:59:41.000Z,Darcella,So informative especially for a new mom,"I have learned so much through the articles, videos and tips. It‚Äôs spot on with what is happening each week and time the information perfectly so you don‚Äôt get overwhelmed with info. I‚Äôm a new mom and love seeing how the baby develops each week and how big he‚Äôs getting."

Great and versatile content, fun to use, regular personalized updates and reminders sent to e-mail. It was and is of a great help in these best and most difficult times in woman's life, when everything is new and scary. I recommend it with all my heart to future mums!"
1140,1140,5,2021-07-28T00:34:07.000Z,Chelsie L,Used it my whole pregnancy,This app was awesome during my pregnancy. I‚Äôm pretty much used it as something to look forward too and get excited about. Each month learning something new about the baby growing inside of you up until learning about new developments after you give birth.
1141,1141,5,2021-07-14T16:06:38.000Z,Hezi's mom,Best app,Love the ease of this app and the fact that I can keep all babies information compiled into one. I love how the app notifies me of milestones that I should be seeing in my baby presently or in the future according to his age. Love the photo stickers that I can use in tracking his age being able to look back and see how much he has grown.
1142,1142,1,2021-07-18T02:58:55.000Z,BeeJaayyy,Unreliable,"I put in the gender of my baby and this app still refers to my baby as the opposites. It feels weird reading about your baby as the app refers to her as a him when you‚Äôre having a girl honestly and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. What‚Äôs the point of having the option to add the gender of the baby? Also in the tools option where you add your bump pictures, they don‚Äôt always load properly, I constantly have to go back and update the photos. One time all of my pictures disappeared too and that was frustrating."
1143,1143,5,2021-07-13T13:40:47.000Z,Doing this for the coins :),Very helpful,I really enjoy using the baby center app. It gives me information about my body and baby that I look forward to learning each week. The format is easy to use. There are many visuals and videos available on different topics available as well. This app is great and helpful.
1144,1144,5,2021-07-06T22:20:10.000Z,Pattyphromkan,Lots of info.,My husband and I love learning each development of our baby. We called the baby by fruit or vegetable names according to its size in each week. We knew what test or procedure expect to be done. Things a pregnant woman can or cannot eat‚Ä¶. And so much information to learn and yet so easy access the app. Thank you
1145,1145,5,2021-06-23T17:11:19.000Z,ironbrooke,So helpful and informative!,"I am now using this app for a second baby, years apart and they have made many beneficial updates to the app to keep it fresh. I love reading about my baby‚Äôs progress each week and getting helpful tips that I forgot about pregnancy since my first go round. Truly no complaints!"
1146,1146,5,2021-06-22T17:34:54.000Z,HaverlyJaneOfficial,I don‚Äôt usually write reviews BUT,"BabyCenter is literally THE BEST. I came here for all my pregnancies for the support I was lacking and for the questions i needed to ask and got the REAL answers and things that the doctors don‚Äôt tell you at BabyCenter from all the communities. Everyone there is so understanding, supportive and always willing to help. It‚Äôs SUCH a comforting community."
1147,1147,5,2021-06-13T22:55:35.000Z,mileenarae,Love this app,I have used this app for both of my children now and I love it. My favorite is that it doesn‚Äôt stop after you have the baby.

1148,1148,4,2021-05-30T17:33:26.000Z,vebana,Pregnancy app,"This app has lots of resources, I love it. It is so accurate with the symptoms, the weight of the baby ect. They have different categories on questions, other moms helping out. Different group chats, it‚Äôs amazing. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it which is why I gave it 4 stars is, because sometimes I would go on the app and it wants me to sign in, that‚Äôs very annoying to be honest."
1149,1149,4,2021-05-24T14:44:26.000Z,Chavezj93,Very helpful app,"This app was so helpful while being pregnant, had a lot of good information. Your able to take your monthly bump photo, and also check for what you can and cannot eat while preggo. They also have good articles. The best part is being part of a group of other parents giving each other advice or answering any questions."
1150,1150,5,2021-05-07T16:01:55.000Z,StephGettingAnnoyed,Love this app,I have had an app before this one. but it made me pay to get the information I get for free on this one. I love seeing the picture of what my baby looks like inside me. The break down of how the baby‚Äôs forming. Also the size comparison to foods. I also like to read the articles. All this good information all for free.

1152,1152,5,2021-04-19T22:13:59.000Z,Paris Aproved,I LOVE IT!,"This is by far one of the best pregnancy apps that I‚Äôve ever used. They send weekly updates to share with you the changes your body will go through, and to update you on the growth of your baby. It is so exciting getting reminders that my husband and I only have 7wks to go before we meet our precious bundle of joyüíô"
1153,1153,5,2021-03-15T13:11:16.000Z,gracelynandmom,Best app ever!,When I was carrying my baby girl the app was on point with sign and symptoms. I had my baby 4 days before my due date and was much more prepared because of baby center. Now I love looking forward to see what my baby development could look like. Love this app! very informative as well definitely will be keeping it

I had terrible cramps and pains, and it scared me all day. The app actually had a notification appear that mentioned ‚Äúcramps, what it means, what you should do‚Äù. It also explains the size of Baby each week and what is growing."

Especially now during this pandemic there are groups inside the app that helps you understand more the impact of this virus on a pregnant woman. Also on the development of your baby even after is born is really great.
1157,1157,5,2020-12-02T21:04:06.000Z,Ô∏èShannon,Literally THE best!,"This has been LITERALLY THE BEST pregnancy app I have ever EVER used!

1158,1158,4,2020-12-04T21:11:12.000Z,xXSirenXx07,Great reference but a little advanced,"I‚Äôve used this app through pregnancy and now my son is nearly two. It has been amazing to reference as to what he should or could be doing, but has been a little advanced sometimes, but some kids are better at certain skills than others. I look forward to continue to use this app as he grows."
1159,1159,5,2020-11-10T20:34:29.000Z,juliaaadee,Lovely app,Like that there are other pregnant women on the app that share the same birth month and stories about their pregnancy along the way. Like the raffles and the support boards. Easy to use app and very informational about the baby and it‚Äôs growth. Used this app for my first baby 5 years ago and using again for my second! üôÇ
1160,1160,5,2018-10-12T05:01:22.000Z,karessacohen,Great Resources,"I have used this site for all 3 of my children and now the 4th my oldest is 7 years old, my youngest is 6 months and I still get updates on my oldest to the bun in the oven. So I definitely recommend this app if you are expecting and are new or just simply want to learn about what‚Äôs going on inside week by week!"
1161,1161,5,2019-01-11T14:05:00.000Z,Mom of Princess,Love!,"I am a mom of 3 gorgeous princesses and each pregnancy has been different. I have learned so much through the videos, articles and blogs. Love it! It makes me feel like I‚Äôm not alone when struggling through sleepless night, terrible twos, etc. All the advice and experiences are enlightening and helps me through those difficult mommy moments."
1162,1162,5,2020-11-08T16:27:11.000Z,sleepy_boi76,Most helpful an fun app!,"I‚Äôve never written a review before but this one deserves it! It is the most helpful app for pregnancy, it‚Äôs so fun an exciting it tells you exactly how big your baby is how it‚Äôs growing, how your body‚Äôs growing, gives so many helpful tips etc ..more than any doctor has !! I check it every single day, obsessed."
1163,1163,5,2020-02-12T18:47:38.000Z,briiiiiidge,Best pregnancy / baby app,"I loved this app the most while I was pregnant. It was so informative. I‚Äôve always used the forum to ask questions to other moms and moms to be. My favorite part was the ability to take bumpies! Now that I‚Äôve had my daughter, I love it even more because there‚Äôs information for after your pregnancy too."
1164,1164,2,2020-06-05T07:28:18.000Z,BKisTha1,Something‚Äôs wrong,I really used to like this app until I updated it. I can‚Äôt even see the wks ahead anymore. It‚Äôs like sometimes the current wk works and then it doesn‚Äôt and if I try to look ahead it‚Äôs like the app purposely doesn‚Äôt load anything but a blank page. Bee have a right to know what‚Äôs going on whether we look at the current wk or wk ahead! Like.. can we just have the old baby center back? I think I‚Äôm about to just uninstall this app until this issue is fixed. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1165,1165,1,2020-05-03T15:51:35.000Z,philipmjewell,Update Changed Pregnancy Tracker,"The update changed the pregnancy tracker, so it no longer has the correct timeline of my pregnancy, and it is ridiculously hard to navigate. It is a completely different app altogether. Nothing like the previous version where it shows your week and you scroll through the day by day articles of that week. I can‚Äôt even make sense of it anymore. Why not just make a different app? Why change the existing one (with a huge amount of positive reviews) into something completely different?"
1166,1166,2,2020-05-01T14:37:35.000Z,Sav2169,Good but could be better,I don‚Äôt like that in the 5th week it has a article about understanding miscarriage. That shouldn‚Äôt be on my feed of being pregnant it should be on the app but after you report a loss. It just worries people with it there. Also it‚Äôs stupid for there to be a quiz on there that says are you pregnant take the quiz... like duh I‚Äôm pregnant I put my due date in. Some of the stuff is really dumb on here I don‚Äôt need to be asked about my mental health every time I open the app. Not everyone is depressed.
1167,1167,2,2020-04-27T13:41:20.000Z,jaxmomma310,Constant glitches,Currently not getting notifications on the app. It‚Äôs very frustrating trying to comment or communicate with others when you never know if they respond.
1168,1168,5,2019-08-13T12:50:32.000Z,graceadams123,Love this app!,"I had about five apps during my pregnancy, and this was by far my favorite one! It was so easy to use and the updates and insights were so readily available to me. It was so fun to track the progress of my baby‚Äôs development and read interesting articles in regards to what I was experiencing that week in my pregnancy."
1169,1169,5,2019-06-23T15:13:15.000Z,Mrs_JJPic,Extremely Helpful,I used BabyCenter throughout my pregnancy and am still using it now for info on my little one. The information is reliable and just in time with its week to week delivery and updates. My husband uses BabyCenter as well and we both enjoy the updates and discuss the weekly milestones.

Since they are older now, I downloaded this app as an educational experience for them, so they can learn more about what's happening and how Baby is developing. They are loving being able to see pictures/videos of their new brother or sister and keep track of how baby is growing week to week. So far it's been a lot of fun!"
1172,1172,5,2018-01-07T06:07:06.000Z,Ggddhjb,I had my daughter very early,This app is so great for pregnancy! However I had my daughter 24w3d. So yes super early! And she is a rock star- doing really really well!!! I wish the this app or any app would have been able to do a conversion from pregnancy to motherhood for me and Maylee (my daughter) but it‚Äôs ok. I know that our situation is rare (thankfully) and there isn‚Äôt ‚Äúan app for that‚Äù

With my mommy brain atm its hard to remember my log in information! And for the life if me, I cannot figure out if it‚Äôs like a setting I have it set to or something. Like, can I do something to stop it from logging me out? I do not knowü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

It‚Äôs very informative and isn‚Äôt too annoying with ads. The only issue I have is it‚Äôs constantly randomly logging me out for some reason haha but luckily my phone remembers my password and it‚Äôs quick to get back in. That‚Äôs the only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a full 5 stars.

1197,1197,5,2019-11-06T03:32:20.000Z,Armyvet09,Great app,This is a great app but I do think you should be able to use the app after your baby turns 1 years old. I‚Äôm saying that because I had a micro preemie and those who have preemies must go by age adjusted and not their actual age. This is due to developmental delays due to being born prematurely. This will be great for those who have preemies or micro preemies.
1198,1198,5,2019-09-15T14:24:08.000Z,SShea34,Amazing.,"Used this app for my first pregnancy and still get updates about my 4 year old, now I‚Äôm using it again for my second child and it‚Äôs been just as great with even newer things added it seems like. Whenever I have questions I can search and I always find what I‚Äôm looking for!"
1199,1199,5,2019-09-11T19:53:04.000Z,Far.Kri,Looove it.,"I love and appreciate the parenting advice. I have two kids and it gives unique ideas, expectations, learning and parenting advice formulated for their ages and genders. It‚Äôs helpful and I honestly think it helps with my own personal growth by learning different ways to teach and raise my children when another way doesn‚Äôt work for me."
1200,1200,5,2018-06-02T11:38:35.000Z,dgonzo123,Has if all!!,"I never write reviews so clearly i found this one to be amazing if i am now. This app was AMAZING through my pregnancy, answered every single question and then some. Still has so much information today for my daily/weekly updates for my little nugget and i‚Äôd be lost without it. DEFINITELY recommend getting it."
1201,1201,5,2018-06-18T12:53:05.000Z,molly831927,A Mama‚Äôs Bible,No matter what my question I can usually find 1-4 articles on it here! The app is easy to navigate and get around on. I like the weekly updates with the opening page being an article pertinent to that phase or an upcoming phase for my baby or toddler. I have tried other apps but none are quite as robust as this one!
1202,1202,3,2018-07-21T16:15:43.000Z,PregnantMama_,Persistent bug,The app is ok. I like content. The reason I gave it 3 stars is that they have a bug that I emailed them about and it still keep on happening. The app keeps on logging you out on the phone about every 2-3 days. I have deleted the app once due to that. I installed it again not long ago hoping that it was improved. But unfortunately it is happening still on a regular basis. I don‚Äôt have time for this. Deleting again.
1203,1203,5,2018-09-04T05:22:07.000Z,Friebolt,Perfect baby app,"I absolutely loved this when I had my first baby. So many helpful resources on here not to mention the community chat rooms. It puts me at ease when I‚Äôm going through some difficult times that there are other moms out there not only going through the same, but give extra support."
1204,1204,5,2018-10-01T03:29:14.000Z,Uzameres,Amazing help for new mommy‚Äôs!,"This app has been so helpful and informative. Every step of the way I gain insight on my health, the baby‚Äôs health and ways to stay mentally and emotionally healthy as well. I am appreciate of the help it‚Äôs given me. With this being our first baby, baby center is our guidance into parenthood. Thank you so much for what you do, Baby center!"
1205,1205,5,2018-10-20T21:38:30.000Z,Annalise Q,Great Advice,I had this app during my pregnancy and it was always on point with articles and advice on what I was going through during that trimester or week . Now that I had the baby at least once a week I get a notification on what to expect and different topics about the mommy and baby which is great .
1206,1206,5,2018-12-02T12:01:37.000Z,BabyHenrysMom,Helpful Tracker,I added the Baby Center App to my phone once I found out I was pregnant at 5 weeks and I still have on my phone now that my little guy is 4 months old.  It‚Äôs been a great resource for those random questions that come up while navigating through pregnancy and parenthood.  I recommend this app.
1207,1207,5,2019-01-16T03:29:19.000Z,Nellzbellz7,Love this app,"When my husband and I found out we were pregnant it was a huge shock! We had no idea what to do or plan for. I‚Äôm so thankful we found this app, it has really helped us along the way to understand exactly how our baby is growing and what to expect. I love the weekly updates and all of the extra articles."
1208,1208,5,2019-03-22T07:57:13.000Z,honeyxx13,Awesome app,I recommend this up to everybody! It helps you out in so many ways while pregnant and still after giving birth it gives tons of information you need to know and tips you would want to see! And of course you can take bumpies and selfies of your kids and save them! I love this app!
1209,1209,5,2019-04-02T22:40:31.000Z,Justmy_luck_,Great,As a first time mom I used this app from the time I found out I was pregnant until my daughter turned one because once your child is a year old you ‚Äúout grow‚Äù the app. I think it‚Äôs a great place to learn and you can also talk to other moms about their experiences and get support from them. It‚Äôs great in my opinion!
1210,1210,1,2017-12-03T07:24:05.000Z,ohbladiohblada,Liked the app before most recent update,"In the latest update, I like the improvements to scrolling and a few other features, but this thing stops when I‚Äôm in the middle of reading and goes blank, and majority of the time new posts don‚Äôt load even when you hit the ‚Äúload more‚Äù button. I have to completely exit from the app and close it down from my phone then open it up again and then search all the posts again if I want to continue reading where I left off. PLEASE FIX! I used to enjoy this app."
1211,1211,5,2018-02-06T03:17:31.000Z,Lizzurdbeth,Fantastic!,"Helped my whole pregnancy and now helping with my new baby! It‚Äôs honestly super helpful, I just think it‚Äôd be cool if there was a search function in the app to find specific articles instead of having to search the web and then connecting to the app. Still amazing the way it is though!"
1212,1212,2,2018-05-14T11:55:27.000Z,Sgonzalezx,Keeps logging me out,"I like be this app, but only when it works. I made an account with my email and clicked keep me logged in. Some days I‚Äôm logged in and other days it has logged me out. I input my login info and it says invalid. I click reset password, put in my email and it doesn‚Äôt send any emails. It‚Äôs frustrating because I want to read the articles and get updates on my baby‚Äôs progress. I wish this app would just stop being bipolar because I‚Äôm already pregnant and moody."
1213,1213,5,2018-05-24T17:15:32.000Z,Maui_Mary73,Great app‚Äô,"I love this app! It has been really helpful and has so much information on all stages of pregnancy. I also like the fact that women can talk to each other/support each other on this app. Plus there‚Äôs an area for you to keep your personal information like weekly bump photos, doctors appointments, name ideas, etc.."

I look forward to the same amazing benefits as my baby girl grows. Seriously an amazing app full of useful information! I rarely had to Google anything and if I did, a BabyCenter resource would be one of the top results anyway. Lol."
1217,1217,5,2021-05-17T14:05:46.000Z,Amilah's Mommy,My child‚Äôs growth,I like being able to understand what‚Äôs happening with my child when it‚Äôs happening or after it‚Äôs happened. I learned so much by reading the monthly and sometimes weekly updates on my child‚Äôs growth. I love the app and I will continue to use it with all of my children.

1221,1221,5,2021-01-20T02:02:26.000Z,mreyes1st,Great resource,"I normally don't take the time to rate apps but this one was so helpful that I felt I needed to do it. My wife and I just had our first baby and I loved reading the weekly update and learn how my baby was developing week by week. Even now that he is here, I like to read about we is happening to him week by week."
1222,1222,1,2021-01-23T00:12:25.000Z,audreyshow,Changed for the worse,"Every time I open a thread now it opens a new window, and then when I go back to my birth board, it refreshes the screen and I have to scroll and scroll trying to find where I was before. It is so annoying and I‚Äôve found I participate a lot less as a result. I hardly ever want to open a thread to read it because I know I‚Äôm gonna have to start over again at the top of the board when I go back. I‚Äôve tried the back arrow and just closing the window it opens. Same thing. So frustrating."
1223,1223,5,2020-12-24T13:20:03.000Z,MsINeedcash,Fetal Growth,The best part of using this app is being able to track my pregnancy weekly and the growth of my little baby. I am very anxious to find out what the next week changes in development will be for my little Angel. Sometimes I do read ahead to find out what I have to look forward to.
1224,1224,5,2020-11-30T07:35:17.000Z,Jay.Lee.Me,Second time using Baby Center App!,"I love baby center app! Not only are the updates to tracking your pregnancy so easy to use and access, but I also love using them for my almost 1 year old and tracking all her milestones and searching up information on ANY topic I had questions about! Love it! üòç"
1225,1225,4,2020-12-01T23:24:45.000Z,Shescriptures,Keep information gender neutral,There is information that refers the baby to ‚Äúshe‚Äù when not everyone is having a girl or even know the sex of the baby until it‚Äôs born. It would be nice to have the information to be referred to baby always. Example is given in my weekly growth it said ‚Äúshe‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm having and it would nice to just have it referred to baby.
1226,1226,5,2020-11-05T15:52:12.000Z,Chattykat0322,Helping hand,Can‚Äôt keep your head together or you need a helping hand with remembering certain things about the baby. Want to brush up on some facts or just do a little reading of what one may expect helps sooth the anxiety. As a first time mom with a lot of questions this app helped me and still continues to do so.
1227,1227,4,2020-11-10T02:59:32.000Z,123gaby,I use this app weekly sometimes more!,I don‚Äôt like how when your a day ahead it claims that you‚Äôre an entire week ahead. I think it would be cool too if the added a check list for every trimester to help you prepare along the way! Other than that the app does what it‚Äôs suppose to do and give you information about your pregnancy along the way
1228,1228,4,2020-05-30T02:34:31.000Z,CML7166,Helpful and informative,"I like the babycenter app - I can quickly scroll through weekly and learn about my baby‚Äôs development, what to expect in pregnancy, as well as tips for making pregnancy more comfortable. I sometimes feel the videos and information is too minimal and could be expounded on. Overall I would recommend this app to expecting mothers!"
1229,1229,2,2020-08-12T02:52:07.000Z,carrotorkumquat,Hate the upgrade.,This app used to have daily tips and an easy to follow format. Now it‚Äôs just crammed full of adds with the videos and information much harder to see. I also used to be able to select the baby icon and see where my baby was developmentally. Now I just get a blank screen when I click on the image. And how am I supposed to be a produce expert? Labels for these random fruit and vegetables would be helpful! I‚Äôm likely switching apps after these updates.
1230,1230,5,2019-06-08T17:24:06.000Z,Brittcritt,Incredibly Accurate,Incredible app! Every week has been so spot on with information pertaining to my symptoms and questions that I may have as I progress during my pregnancy. Sometimes it‚Äôs scary how accurate they give specific information down to the day. Very happy I downloaded Baby Center!

This is super annoying as I might be writing a response in one of the forums, get a text that I respond to, and then when I go back to finish my response it‚Äôs gone and I‚Äôm back on the weekly calendar. It makes it very annoying to use so I find myself going days without even looking at it because it‚Äôs so frustrating to just have it restart."
1238,1238,4,2019-07-02T11:59:25.000Z,Future2212,JazmineE,"I love the app . Very helpful with keeping track of  what is going on with my bundle of joy & also the changes of my body, As well as what to do & not to do. Only thing I have a problem with is I constantly sometimes have to keep logging in because the App. Automatically signs me out. & Most of the time I would have to reset the password. Overall I Love The App."
1239,1239,4,2019-06-28T15:45:48.000Z,Shannn9,4 stars,The app is absolutely great. This is my first pregnancy using the app and I really love it. It also has a ‚Äúbumpie‚Äù pic feature where you can take a picture of your belly every week and it saves it in a album for you to look at later! The only downside to the app is that it logs me out every 2 days or so which gets annoying. But otherwise it‚Äôs great.

During scary times when I don‚Äôt know what was happening, before I called my doctors or nurses I checked to see if this app had any answers to what may be going on.

This app is very informative and really helps me throughout the journey. I would recommend this app to any pregnant women but especially first timers like myself.

1245,1245,1,2018-06-11T15:13:19.000Z,2LoveGrl,Beware,This app has old threads. If you don‚Äôt read the date and comment the other women jump all over you and are very rude. I watched other women post and get jumped all over. I thought this was a place for pregnant women to go and feel empowered but instead it was the opposite. I had only been on the site 24hours when this happen to me and others. It was very upsetting to experience and watch. I think after awhile this app should have a feature where you can no longer post on older threads. To avoid this kind of bullying behavior.
1246,1246,2,2018-07-25T19:00:59.000Z,britni2112,Save buttons don‚Äôt work,"Overall I like the website but none of the save button work. So I can‚Äôt add a new picture my profile, change any of my account preferences, or really change anything that needs to be saved. I‚Äôve also noticed it‚Äôs not just their app at all so they‚Äôre mobile website on chrome and Safari the save button don‚Äôt work either. And both the mobile app and websites on the phone are very very slow to load things."

I‚Äôve learned a lot about how to get my crazy toddler to eat and why he throws wild tantrums! All pregnancies are different and the birthing groups you can join help you keep an open mind and tell you about things you were clueless to!

1253,1253,5,2021-06-24T05:11:53.000Z,gribboo,Keeps me a few steps ahead,Baby Center keeps me one or more steps ahead of my child. The topics cover even more than I am aware of. I really appreciate the weekly emails and the brief synopsis so I can click if I‚Äôm interested. I‚Äôll often receive a great article that I end up saving to my ‚Äúparenting‚Äù folder as good advice.

Through all stages. Always giving advice as baby grows. And always giving growth stages for baby and things that change. They are really good at helping you prepare for baby and as they grow! Truly helped me out a ton!!

My last baby was 10 years ago so it really comes in handy! Has all types of suggestions for baby‚Äôs care as he grows and starts to do more things. Was also helpful in selecting a name for him. Love it!! Would recommend to anyone!!

However, I warn you....at 1 year you are dropped with no explanation. They don‚Äôt celebrate the baby turning 1. They don‚Äôt give an explanation why you won‚Äôt get updates any more, just dropped. I get that you can‚Äôt continue forever, but there should be something that explains this. I was extremely disappointed!"
1272,1272,3,2020-06-23T07:06:30.000Z,itsgownow,Good resource but accuracy flaws,I‚Äôve used this for multiple pregnancies to track changes and read articles but now that I have a baby and a pregnancy it can‚Äôt accurately calculate my baby‚Äôs age even though the birth date is correct. My pregnancy timeline is accurate and today‚Äôs date showing at top is accurate. The informational videos are not helpful or well made but the articles can be a good resource.

I use to look forward to each days info & videos since they were all separated by the date , But now they updated the whole app to where it‚Äôs all mushed together . The videos and info is all together for the whole week instead of day to day which kind of kills the whole looking forward to a new day with a new piece of info ."

And you get updates and tips on babies growth and development. There also mom groups where you get to ask other people all those ‚Äúis this normal??‚Äù Questions !

If I‚Äôm only 17 weeks I don‚Äôt want to talk about my pregnancy at 30 weeks, I haven‚Äôt made it that far yet. I would like the experience to be in the moment. The photos should reflect the week you‚Äôre in so you can capture it in the now. Just a suggestion...."

There was a lot of useful information. The downside in this app are the groups. Some are good but others are filled with rude, belittling, and condescending members. They are quick to judge and put in THEIR two cents. They are not there to be supportive or helpful in any way. I‚Äôve posted the exact same story in this app and WTE and the difference between members of the apps is astounding. If you want helpful and generous feedback, go to What to Expect."

Some ladies are very kind, but you could clearly see the same ‚Äúmean girls‚Äù group being a bully in other posts. Tons of interesting posts ended up deleted because the same people never knew how to disagree on a respectful manner. Their mean behavior was somehow encouraged and viewed as funny by the other women. I mostly observed the conversations, but it was enough for me not wanting to associate myself with this type of nonsense."

1289,1289,3,2019-06-19T18:06:10.000Z,Disappointed58793,Meh,I think the pregnancy side of this app is lacking. I wish there were daily updates on the baby size and what is growing right now it‚Äôs only articles. I feel like I‚Äôm juggling three apps to get the info I want and I wish it was all on one. Also it‚Äôs not easy to get to your posts on the community. I want to see if anyone has replied to my posts but can‚Äôt figure out to do that so I wish it was more user friendly.
1290,1290,5,2018-02-08T13:26:34.000Z,Mimilonchis,Great app,"Downloaded the app when I found out I was pregnant for the first time.

The only thing I'd like to see different, is having several things comparing the baby's size to different things (ex. Toys, utilities, different foods, etc.) but it has a ton of great information for free."

1293,1293,5,2018-05-18T02:59:01.000Z,Ms. Pineda,The perfect pregnancy/growing baby app!,I honestly enjoy this app. I installed it on my phone during my pregnancy and it was great to read what I should expect as a first time mom and what I need for a diaper bag and registry and hospital bag. Now I‚Äôm currently using it for my 5 month old and it gives me tips on feeding and milestones to expect for each month. It‚Äôs amazing.

I would recommend for first time moms and moms that have had a bit of time between pregnancies (I have 10 years b/w pregnancies). I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for experienced moms or moms who have had back to back pregnancies, unless you want weekly reminders of what week you are on. :)"

So many stuff I was surprised I never knew about until I got pregnant. Always new topics covered everyday to learn throughout every stage of pregnancy and so worth saving your trips to the bookstore/library on pregnancy.

I‚Äôm so disappointed in it. It‚Äôs not user friendly at all! The only reason I keep using it is because I started using it to take my bumpies and want to just finish them out looking the same. It logs me out almost every time I try to use it (minor but annoying). The chats are hard to follow along with. I wish I would have stuck with What to Expect from the beginning. Much easier IMO."

The problem is that most of the time I can‚Äôt even access the articles or see what‚Äôs developing with me and my baby because they don‚Äôt load. I dealt with it for 3 weeks thinking maybe it was my location or something on my end but it‚Äôs just getting annoying now.
1328,1328,5,2020-02-21T15:37:01.000Z,BonnnFire,A must have for pregnancy!,This app has so many great articles and it‚Äôs so informative! I‚Äôve found it really helpful whenever I had a question. The only thing that throws me off is when the articles refer to your baby as a boy and girl. It‚Äôs kind of odd and they probably should keep the articles neutral.
1329,1329,5,2019-12-10T23:31:31.000Z,NewMamaT,Awesome!,"I learn so much from this app! Being a new mom, I have so many questions about pretty much everything. The articles are super helpful and informative - they answer a lot of my questions. Also the community of other moms makes me feel not so alone. Would definitely recommend!"
1330,1330,5,2018-10-12T21:30:21.000Z,katie.k.henk.,Love it!,Amazing!!! Very educational and helpful! I use this every day to keep track of my baby‚Äôs growth and developmental changes. It also helps me (mom) learn new things and prepare for baby to arrive!! I have found so much helpful information on this app. Every time I open it I get more excited for my little one to arrive!
1331,1331,5,2018-12-04T17:26:46.000Z,hazelsoap,Thoughtful layout,I love that the app takes you week by week and provides useful info about BOTH mom AND baby. I also love the community available of other moms to talk to and read about their experiences and build friendships there. Great app! I‚Äôve used it for every pregnancy thus far and will continue to.
1332,1332,5,2018-12-05T16:24:05.000Z,Melina S,Love it,I love this app it has everything you need and so many helpful articles to choose from. I also love the community of other mothers that are due in your same month that you get to connect with. It‚Äôs very educational and I love that I get updates on what‚Äôs going on with the development of my baby.
1333,1333,4,2019-01-15T01:50:30.000Z,Mexi-Cali,Pregnancy 411,"Great app- very informational and helpful throughout my pregnancy.  It was my go to app for baby questions and concerns.  Love that it covers week by week, lets you know what to expect, and shares all that helpful baby anatomy and growth. Totally loved the app!!! And now that baby has arrived it‚Äôs still helpful and is now giving me insight to what‚Äôs going on with baby now that he‚Äôs out.  Totally recommend it :)"

While we all know that all baby develop differently, it‚Äôs great to know I have an app I can count on should I have any questions. üíú"
1335,1335,5,2019-11-15T09:47:56.000Z,lkmunn,I love,This app has taught me a lot and prepared me pretty well for the journey I‚Äôm going to be having!! I would say the chat rooms are sordof confusing and messy but I really didn‚Äôt care to use them anyways!! Every thing else from teaching you about labor to what babies need and preparing you mentally and emotionally too for a newborn is all there!
1336,1336,5,2019-11-03T13:30:36.000Z,DMDRB,Everybody loves baby center,I downloaded many apps during pregnancy and definitely baby center is one of th bests. I still use it now and my baby is 5 months old. Baby center has one of the best data base when it comes to those questions that seem that nobody will know. Another thing I deeply lobe is their growth chart!
1337,1337,5,2019-07-11T12:43:07.000Z,carsonsmama18,Peace of Mind,"With all the worries that come with being a new mom, this app helped clear any confusion, answer any questions, and reveal new information I had no idea about.

1338,1338,1,2019-08-15T05:31:06.000Z,Gothica.girl.who,Catty,"Most of the threads in your groups are full of catty women who aren‚Äôt there to lift you up, but to call what you want to name your child ‚Äústupid‚Äù. There‚Äôs absolutely no support, and the people in charge of monitoring the groups, just add onto the cattiness."
1339,1339,5,2019-07-05T02:39:18.000Z,LandieKyss,Recommend to all!,This is a great place to get all kinds of info whether your baby is in or out of the womb. I loved following along while pregnant and now it‚Äôs a great place to search for answers to questions I have while my baby is growing. The forum is a great source of info and entertainment as well üòÅ Super great all around!

To the point where it's difficult to use because it will stop typing or not load anything. Other than that, I love the information it provides. Very accurate and informative. But please please please fix the glitches!"
1343,1343,5,2018-02-08T12:24:58.000Z,SuzeFarmer,I use this app everyday,"I love the weekly updates this app gives me. I‚Äôm on my third pregnancy & still reading what the baby is doing each week & the size feels so special!  Also, I use it as a resource for many questions that still come up & feel it is a reliable tool for knowledge."
1344,1344,5,2018-05-29T12:34:21.000Z,SeptemberKay,LOVE IT,"I loveeeee this app. Had it my whole pregnancy, kept me updated on my weeks and also I was able to learn new things.

1347,1347,4,2018-06-23T08:46:08.000Z,Brunettebombshell91,Love it!,I loved being able to track my baby‚Äôs growth and development! I only gave the app 4 stars because I couldn‚Äôt get the app to transition to my baby being born. I would enter the birth date but every time I opened the app it was still back on week 41 for my pregnancy. I had to delete the app and reinstall with my baby‚Äôs birth date to get the post birth development tracker
1348,1348,5,2018-09-06T17:46:42.000Z,riflegurl,I love BabyCenter,This app has been an amazing resource and has taught me so much. It has also eased my mind many of times both through pregnancy and in the first months of being a Mommy! I downloaded three apps when I got pregnant and this is the only one I still have downloaded. Very thankful to have the BabyCenter app.

Love to just read things and get updated information. So many things change w each pregnancy...even though I'm a pro by now...it's always some new interesting topics.

Is everything going alright?‚Äù Baby Center really helped me understand what‚Äôs going on and has kept me present with my pregnancy. It has great resources for what to expect and tips for how to handle it. It helps me stay excited and educated."
1353,1353,5,2021-07-02T21:40:02.000Z,Nani Bonkerz,Uh HELLO new moms!!,all new moms should run to get this. It‚Äôs so new so hard and so overwhelming at times. Of course rewarding but it hurts so much when you don‚Äôt know what something is or what‚Äôs going on and it‚Äôs 2 maybe 3 AM. This app has helped me so much before baby and after. We come together as mother‚Äôs maybe fathers on this app too. HOORAY to us parents.
1354,1354,5,2021-05-13T05:05:52.000Z,TaylorJJames,App review,I really enjoyed using this app. It was helpful to track my baby‚Äôs progress and have an idea of what to expect each month. The search engine/function was robust and captured every single thing I inquired about. I would highly recommend this app to anyone searching for a good one.
1355,1355,4,2021-06-30T17:36:47.000Z,*SSSSSSS*,Helpful and simple,"Helps keep track of weeks, and is a quick check to see what‚Äôs going on with baby that week. I like it because it is simple and I don‚Äôt have time to do a long book chapter every week. This is a way to track without being overwhelmed. They have extra  info if you want to go deeper too."
1356,1356,5,2021-05-03T21:37:04.000Z,Create out of love!,Love this app!,It‚Äôs very informative and it helps you prepare yourself on a lot of things you may not know. I try not to research anything on Google because you can get yourself in a dark hole and that's not always good. Stick with asking your doctor and this app great way to have a piece of mind through your pregnancy.
1357,1357,5,2021-05-03T18:10:21.000Z,Ms.0913,Great app!,I used this app all through my pregnancy and continue to use it as my newborn grows.

Wish they had an option for miscarriages with my first pregnancy because of how heart breaking it was to open my email and see how far along my baby would have been. But with my rainbow and our now second expecting has been awesome. Love seeing how far I am!!üíï
1360,1360,5,2021-02-08T14:02:48.000Z,¬°TAO!,I love it!,This app was so helpful during my first pregnancy and even postpartum I still use it.

The community chat is reassuring. What I like the most is the monthly milestone information. Knowing how our child will develop and things to look out for.

Came to the app‚Äôs community for any questions or advice I was seeking as well. Nice to have other pregnant mamas to share your experiences with that can relate to you. I otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have had that.

A lot of useful information and helpful tips. I love the group chat rooms with expecting mothers with the similar due dates in the same month.

I feel it does a good job in informing me . However if you get the wrong day of your cycle wrong and try to go back and retract I Could Not . Had to log out and get a new email address. That should be an easy fix hopefully you guys read this suggestion ü•∞

1373,1373,3,2020-05-14T12:59:42.000Z,khaleesi mommy,New mom,Baby center for the most part is informative and detailed but some info is changed randomly the way they track your weeks is confusing. In one week it would say I‚Äôm in my 6 th month and next it says 5. With nothing in our world being normal or consistent right now it would be nice to know this info is. I‚Äôm a first time mom and it‚Äôs frustrating when they just switch facts on you .
1374,1374,5,2019-12-03T17:13:05.000Z,Smriti Pathak,A new mom‚Äôs best friend !,They just know what‚Äôs going on in your mind.

Most moms, especially experienced ones are willing to help or give advice on any questions you have as a first, second, third...time mom."
1381,1381,2,2018-11-08T12:23:56.000Z,Lax000,Started out informative...,"BabyCenter was my go to place for all things as a brand new mom to be. However I miscarried early in my pregnancy. Unlike most pregnancy apps there is no miscarriage mode. I am left with weekly updates about a baby that I am longer carrying, along with my email being sold to many other baby vendors soliciting goods I do not need right now. It would be great to have a miscarriage mode like Flo or PreMom where the content and information changes to grieving a loss and TTC again."

The Baby Center has more in-depth insights that are matter of fact without being alarming.  There‚Äôs a reassurance in the information is presented. Even more than my dang doctor!

1389,1389,2,2019-06-22T14:20:27.000Z,Chicaboomchilla,The app is fine. The people aren‚Äôt,"The articles and tracking part of the app is great. But when it comes to the discussion groups, the place people are coming for help, most of the posters are cruel and/or condescending to each other. If you think this is supposed to be a supportive group, it apparently isn‚Äôt. The site really needs to get more moderators out there, unless the purpose of the app is to make expectant and new mothers feel like they are alone in this... then I guess it‚Äôs spot on."

The app gives good information in the right amount, without feeling overwhelming, or like you are forced to do things. It‚Äôs been a very good experience so far. We will let you know in 19 weeks."

There is a black band running down the side of any picture I upload, no matter if it‚Äôs edited or unedited. It totally ruins the image. I have reached out to customer support several times and still have not had a resolution. It‚Äôs the reason I downloaded the app in the first place and now it‚Äôs not even working!"

We both have one daughter each from another relationship and this will be our first boy together. We are a bit older (35) and so naturally I am a bit more concerned than most might be and I find this app to be extremely helpful
1398,1398,5,2018-06-23T16:24:24.000Z,yaya_18,Great,This app really helped me through my first pregnancy. Even after you have the baby there‚Äôs an action where you tell it baby is here and then it guides you through the million questions you have after baby arrives.. my daughter is 4 months and I still use it quirky frequently!!! Great app!!
1399,1399,4,2018-09-21T13:58:26.000Z,sammieisdaddy,My experience,I downloaded this when my best friend got pregnant and I wanted to keep up with everything and it‚Äôs been an amazing app I mean I haven‚Äôt had a child to like got mad at it at all so I think it‚Äôs a very good app and I always wanted to use this app but I new I wouldn‚Äôt have kids no time soon sooo maybe after I get my health back on track I can see how this goes

Checking up what‚Äôs healthy to eat and what not to eat. It‚Äôs just definitely helpful absolutely amazing app."

I love it so much
1403,1403,5,2021-07-27T15:27:32.000Z,Salixium,Amazing App,I‚Äôve used this app for all 3 pregnancies and absolutely love it. It gives you something to look forward to each week even if you already know what that week holds or what fruit you are that week. Haha. I love keeping up with bumpies to see how much you change week to week
1404,1404,5,2021-07-03T14:55:22.000Z,Meli Durz,I love this app!,"It‚Äôs by far the best one I‚Äôve found. It definitely beats babycenter. It‚Äôs so detailed and the fact that I can personalize it and add things about me makes it even better! I‚Äôm able to track my weight, drs apt, to do list or goals and even find suuuper cute baby names!  My search stopped at this app!"
1405,1405,5,2021-06-28T17:57:21.000Z,par40688,It's a great app with great and relevant information!,This app is easy to use and has good information that is very helpful to new parents! I also enjoyed reading all the information about each week of pregnancy and what was happening developmentally with my baby each week!
1406,1406,5,2021-05-18T14:58:19.000Z,Brainquest7705,Love this app,"I am 38week pregnant, clock is ticking üòÅüò¨and this whole journey is amazing with being able to weekly track my pregnancy, my baby‚Äôs growth, symptoms e.t.c"
1407,1407,5,2021-05-06T15:11:05.000Z,baby mama 01,Great App!!,This app keeps the whole pregnancy totally exciting because every week you look forward to the new developments of your sweet pea. It shows you most things to be aware of and to be cautious of and that in itself takes off a lot of stress. 10/10 would recommend.
1408,1408,5,2021-04-27T22:05:25.000Z,Shelllybellyyytuh,Love this app!!,"I have had this app for almost five years now with both my children and my current pregnancy! Always so many helpful tips and resources. Even though this isn‚Äôt my first rodeo, this app truly makes me feel at ease when tracking the development of my pregnancy!"
1409,1409,2,2021-04-28T00:00:32.000Z,lisajn829,Improve community/birth group UX,"In the birth group interface, it‚Äôs quite frustrating when you click on a post to read it in full and read the comments, that when you return to the group to look at more posts, it always sends you back to the top/very first post. So you have to scroll and scroll to find where you left off, and usually the order has changed up on you by then based on new comments."
1410,1410,5,2021-04-01T21:40:51.000Z,Mom2Bee92,So Fun!!,I love looking forward to the weekly updates I show my husband ‚ÄúLook what the baby is doing and see how it‚Äôs changing!‚Äù I love how you are connected by your Due dates to other expecting moms! It‚Äôs a platform where we are all crazy happy nervous and can relate to each other and give support.
1411,1411,5,2021-01-27T09:21:46.000Z,paula.santorini,Always helpful and accurate!,"I have used the app and site for almost 3 years now, during my pregnancies, with my daughter and now with my son. Is so helpful, always with accurate and down to earth answers, great articles and easy to follow videos. Absolutely recommended, specially for new moms!"
1412,1412,2,2021-02-01T18:40:41.000Z,Holdonwait,More like a website than app,"This app is more like a website. Every time I open it I have to re-login. And then when you click any link it opens a ‚Äúnew window‚Äù within the app which is just like a website. And if you want to change settings you have to log in once again - even though you‚Äôre already in the app. Also, there is no option to delete my account from the app. I‚Äôll be trying the website shortly."
1413,1413,5,2021-01-26T21:35:04.000Z,baby zahara,In love,Great app .. just keeps you updated and ahead of everything that is to come and happening.. very exact just love this app it‚Äôs so much help as a first time mom it was a life savor and now with my second child I have used it even more because of how much it helped me out the first time around üíó
1414,1414,5,2020-09-30T16:03:14.000Z,mary123;45,Great,I love receiving notifications of all the things my baby can do. What he should be doing. Puts my mind at ease as a first time parent it‚Äôs so cute. It also tracked my pregnancy and it was so nice to know how my little one is growing and what I should be asking the drs. It also gives great suggestions of products if I‚Äôm not mistaken
1415,1415,2,2021-01-13T03:12:50.000Z,wayjay2020,Might delete,I‚Äôve been debating deleting this app for months because people in the forum are so mean. I honestly feel bullied EVERY time I post anything. I think the comments and replies need to be approved by babycenter. I feel so much more safe and comfortable posting on the what not to expect app because I never read a single mean comment. I feel like I can‚Äôt use baby centers community at all because of users who only want to be mean. I think these need to be more closely monitored.
1416,1416,5,2020-09-25T13:02:23.000Z,cttvhuby,Love this App!,"I frequently go back and forth between this app and the ‚ÄúWhat to Expect‚Äù app. I like that this one places focus on mom and her body changes, as well as what‚Äôs happening with baby. There‚Äôs also lots of facts relevant to the timeframe of your pregnancy and questions to ask tour OB, which I found very helpful with my first."
1417,1417,5,2020-09-23T13:54:53.000Z,Gummi_101,Convenient,Handy little app to keep track of your baby‚Äôs progress/growth & seeing how big they are each week & months. The community is pretty nice & seeing how everyone‚Äôs pregnancy symptoms are similar & giving advise what to take if you aren‚Äôt feeling too well from any sort of pregnancy sickness.
1418,1418,5,2020-06-25T02:20:20.000Z,Specky343,One of the best things anyone has told me about,My sister recommended this app when she found out I was pregnant. It helped her and by far it has been my go-to still and my little one is almost 2! It helps you from day 1. I would highly recommend it to anyone expecting.
1419,1419,5,2020-05-19T04:08:20.000Z,Izzy2495,Love this!,Honestly I had this app throughout my whole pregnancy and I loved it! This app really gives good information about what you will or might be feeling. Now that I have my baby I still use this to track my baby girl's milestones. I recommend this app. This helped me especially cause I‚Äôm a first time mom. üòä
1420,1420,5,2018-10-25T14:58:09.000Z,AmySiss,Love this app !,From the moment I got pregnant I‚Äôve been using the app and it‚Äôs so spot on. I‚Äôve been seeing updates to my babies growth. There‚Äôs a community for questions and discussions. It helped my husband understand the process of what our first child was actually doing to my body. Thank goodness for baby center.
1421,1421,4,2019-01-28T05:36:49.000Z,babydonenow,Great app,The advice is great and I loved the fruit and veggie comparisons during pregnancy. My only gripe is the search feature is terrible. I can never locate an answer I need using it. I have to go to Google and then the baby center website will pop up with my answer. I never understand why my search in the app doesn't just bring up the same result.
1422,1422,5,2019-03-22T09:55:44.000Z,zahra89,Mothers go to,"I first found out about baby center with my first child 10yrs ago and due to me being a teen mom, it help answer all my question and realistically prepare me for delivery. Now I‚Äôm pregnant with my second child, and I‚Äôm excited to be back! Thank you baby center, couldn‚Äôt have done it without you!"
1423,1423,5,2020-02-17T17:37:20.000Z,ZaeZaeBae,Very useful,I truly love this app. I have a horrible memory and it really helps remind me how much longer I have. And it tells you week by week symptoms you may be having and how big baby is. And it has cute little videos you can watch that really make you feel closer to baby
1424,1424,4,2020-03-07T04:25:41.000Z,Bumblebee221992,Good but not for all,I really have liked this app but I am changing due to I get sick of seeing the same ad about breast pumps and seeing a lady feeding her baby with both breasts out. It‚Äôs awesome about nursing but just not something i like to keep seeing over and over again and it won‚Äôt let you remove the ad so I keep seeing it every week. So I deleted the app.
1425,1425,5,2020-01-07T19:41:48.000Z,Homey baby,Love it,Being that this pregnancy was my first. I had no idea what to expect. I‚Äôve heard numerous stories of others and their experiences. But it‚Äôs different when you have an app that is there for you each week.. even months after baby is born.
1426,1426,5,2019-12-01T14:06:39.000Z,TMogan,Key app for expecting parents!,"I have a handful of books that were given to me to prepare me for being pregnant. While these are great resources, the app is my go-to tool that I use almost everyday. I can find answers quickly. My birth is tracked and explained weekly. A friend recommended this app and I‚Äôm glad she did.‚ù§Ô∏è"
1427,1427,5,2019-10-03T13:07:18.000Z,Happy Customer use app,Amazing app for families!!,"As a father, this app allowed me to follow my boys journey from conception to current day! I still get updates on progress and milestones to expect for my 3yr old and my 11mo old! This was a great tool to stay up to date with my wife‚Äôs pregnancy every step of the way and clearly understand the size and developments of my unborn sons."

Only reason I gave it a 4 stars is because it will sometimes log u out and I be forgetting my password so I have to keep on changing it. I have learned sooo much from this app and them videos came in handy. Definitely recommend this app to any expecting moms.
1430,1430,5,2018-02-05T16:18:03.000Z,Cb4675,Don‚Äôt know what I would do without this app!!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíúüíô,Instead of reading the books this is the app I‚Äôve used in both of my pregnancies. Such a helpful app to have & keep track of how far along I am & how the baby is doing :) Great articles that‚Äôs helped me to be organized & become a great parent for my babies.
1431,1431,5,2018-03-13T18:49:07.000Z,ajdunn83,As soon as I signed up the email spam started,"This app is basically a marketing vehicle to push stuff they want you to buy, which I expected partly but what I don‚Äôt love is I now get weekly email soma I can‚Äôt turn off, and appropriately their community email settings page won‚Äôt load."
1432,1432,1,2018-04-14T05:16:46.000Z,nandbcjnff,Don‚Äôt use unless you want to be bashed!!!!,"I downloaded this app and posted a question with a picture, looking for support from other moms to see if they‚Äôre experiencing the same things, and I got bashed to hell. This is OPPOSITE from a supportive community forum. Definitely NEVER using this again nor recommending it. And when you post questions or comments, they can‚Äôt be deleted. Your account also CAN‚ÄôT be deleted. So be careful. I read a lot of women were having this problem and wanted to delete their accounts, but couldn‚Äôt."
1433,1433,5,2018-05-14T18:08:51.000Z,Tikiki-QTPye,You don‚Äôt feel alone,Here you have a complete pregnancy community. Where sometimes one may feel out of place due to pregnancy. You're growing in the mid section and weird cravings are taking place and all of you conversations are surrounding pregnancy. Here you do not feel out of place.

This app has helped me answer so many questions as a first time mom. I love how this app keeps you updated with how big your baby is growing and gives you a visual size of the babe each week.

1437,1437,3,2018-06-16T06:27:29.000Z,Superstar1078,The App is glitchy,"I used the app through my first pregnancy and now 21 weeks into second pregnancy. We found out we are having a boy at 13 weeks and I changed the sex of the baby from ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know‚Äù to ‚Äúboy‚Äù , but it still calls my baby ‚Äúher‚Äù and has asked me to update my profile (which has all the correct information) 3 or 4 times now. Not a big deal but not hugely impressed either."

You also get to interact with other moms, read articles and take polls. It has other features like bumpie (for belly shots every month) and a contraction timer. This is one of the best apps out there for moms who need some extra help üòÑ."

1446,1446,1,2021-06-01T17:20:48.000Z,pldmcc,Horrible company,"Only giving one star bc there‚Äôs no option for ‚Äúzero stars.‚Äù The app is subpar to begin with. Very little information given, nothing most women don‚Äôt already know. To top it off, if you join the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù where all speech should be FREE and encouraged‚Äî If an expectant mother asks for advice and BabyCenter doesn‚Äôt approve of your advice (ie: experimental medical practices) they will remove your comments and disable your entire account. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever given a bad review in my life... this app more than deserved one! Don‚Äôt waste your time."

I‚Äôve learned so much and was reminded every step of the way of the different stages babies go through. I am still learning as they continue to send me growth updates for each one via email!
1462,1462,1,2020-01-24T17:27:22.000Z,2019mother,Good until it lost all of my bump pictures,"I thought this app was good during pregnancy but when I had my baby and switched over into the baby mode, I went back to view all of the weekly bump pictures I had taken and 80% of them were gone. I can never get those back. They save a copy automatically to your phone but I didn‚Äôt keep them thinking they were safe in the app but they were not. Use another app for weekly bump pictures. I am devastated as I can never get those images back.."
1463,1463,5,2019-11-20T18:05:21.000Z,Kim and Grant,This app is incredible,I started using this app the very first day I found out I was preggy!

At Week 6 I was given information on maternity clothes to wear - and all the info given was geared towards the end of pregnancy, when the belly is big. Information in week 9 about contractions, and how far apart they should be, etc. the week you‚Äôre in/info given should coincide. In the first trimester, things such as foods to eat/avoid, body changes, morning sickness, etc should be discussed. Not 3rd trimester information ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

The baby articles and videos are just so helpful and current, which is key. I feel like I have my own personal mommy expert on my phone 24/7."
1471,1471,5,2018-05-22T23:55:31.000Z,NewMom973,Awesome App!,This app is amazing and has been extremely helpful during my pregnancy. This was my first pregnancy so I was clueless about pretty much everything but Baby Center has taught me so much and being in the 'birth club' with other moms and mom to be's has made me so much more confident in asking questions and being a mother.

I use this app so that I can follow along with the pregnancy without bothering my daughter in law for details all of the time. It is extremely informative and keeps me completely entertained with what is going on inside. The videos are the cherry on top for me! Thanks for creating this app!

And love also how you can ask questions and moms from all around could answer. The only thing I dislike is the way some moms answer questions making you feel dumb but that isn‚Äôt the app‚Äôs fault lol.
1480,1480,1,2017-09-26T22:39:13.000Z,samantha3306,After miscarriage it won't stop sending me updates,"First off, this app made recording my miscarriage a real pain when I was already in a fragile state. But now I'm still getting updates! It even has ""in memoriam"" next to the pregnancy on the website. I've gone to the website multiple times to try to fix this but after a month I just got another update. One trimester down, two to go! I wanted to keep all my apps for a future pregnancy but looks like I'll be deleting and not downloading for my next pregnancy!"

1486,1486,3,2021-07-28T14:33:01.000Z,zay2022,Great app but needs one little improvement,"When scrolling through the blogs, and entering one of them, if you try to go back a page it will send you to the very beginning of the list.  It‚Äôs very annoying. It would be nice to go back to the place you were on the list so you don‚Äôt have to keep finding your place.  It almost makes me NOT want to enter a page."

I can talk with other girls who are in the same trimester as me. It tells me how big my baby is. What pregnancy symptoms I might experience that week and answers all my pregnancy questions. I love getting on the app and talk with the other girls.

1492,1492,5,2021-02-10T19:18:10.000Z,SibaMN,A to Z app for pregnancy and baby,It was my first pregnancy when I got it. I rely on it at almost everything concerning my pregnancy and now everything about my baby and her development etc. I really recommend this app for any mother or mother to be if they like to read and like to have a support system (communities).
1493,1493,5,2021-01-21T17:07:11.000Z,Hamilton!993,Good for all mommies,"Awesome site! I love that you are allowed to change the dates of pregnancy. I had a miscarriage but planned to keep trying so I was worried for when I got pregnant again I would still be looking at the old information, well I‚Äôm pregnant again and it let me switch it to the new baby!"
1494,1494,5,2020-12-08T02:58:37.000Z,Genesis loves to work out,Almost perfect,Best app ever love that it‚Äôs free would just appreciate if it could save my articles that pop up because sometimes those get lost as I‚Äôm halfway through so I‚Äôd like an option for read later articles in case I want to save some that I can‚Äôt read in the moment

I now also been using it since he‚Äôs been born & the information has been helpful.
1497,1497,4,2020-11-10T04:22:57.000Z,cohill2019,Love it but,"I love this app BUT.....I know this sounds silly, but as a biracial family I hate that it is assumed the baby is white. This is my second pregnancy using this app. The info is helpful, but there is a lot to be desired in terms of diversity. The products recommended are for white people, and I just don‚Äôt feel like this app takes into account the diversity of its users."
1498,1498,4,2020-11-09T16:38:17.000Z,Neri02,Improved!,I‚Äôm glad there has been an update to track things after reaching one year old. I was kind of bummed when it was just stuck at one year as if that is as far as we need to track their developments and progression. I also like that COVID questions have been added as they are relative to the health of my baby.
1499,1499,5,2020-07-22T09:15:21.000Z,aim2522,Better features,"This app has better features that the other popular baby apps: personalized baby name list, contraction timer... Also has more detailed and accurate information. Would love even more embryological information though."

1501,1501,5,2020-05-04T11:25:06.000Z,T-FEETZ,Great App,Used this app actually more throughout my entire pregnancy than the what to expect when you are expecting app.  Highly recommended for a first time mama to be.  I love the tips that show up week to week and articles that pop up pertaining to how you feel that week.
1502,1502,3,2020-06-12T21:11:38.000Z,Rb0308,Hate the update,"As a first time mom, I LOVED this app all through my pregnancy. I enjoyed the daily articles, adding my ‚Äúbumpie‚Äù, and having a safety check. But ever since the most recent update (lucky coinciding with when my daughter was born) the app has been disappointing. The links to articles rarely work and it all seems to just be product pushing from sponsors. Please go back to the way it was before!"
1503,1503,5,2020-04-02T02:44:22.000Z,La'Aron,Best App Ever,Amazing App every. Once I found out I was pregnant my sister told me what app to download and it was the best thing ever!!

If it‚Äôs an ad that‚Äôs not for the app or something else maternity related, it is just frozen, never plays, and I can‚Äôt watch the dang video! It‚Äôs starting to get really frustrating having to restart my app like five times just so I can hopefully get an ad that won‚Äôt make it freeze. Wtffff lol"

1509,1509,1,2019-06-21T04:43:05.000Z,Scotchflower,What are you doing about bullying?,"The community feature of this app is rife with bullies.  Women dragging other women down, bashing, piling on, egging each other on.  It‚Äôs disturbing and frankly until something is done about it, I could not rate the app higher."
1510,1510,5,2018-07-23T04:18:21.000Z,tfuruya,Keeps logging me out,"Something changed with this app a couple months ago. It used t keep me logged in, but now I am always having to log back in.

This morning I moved into the third trimester and suddenly, my app will no longer work. It opens, closes immediately, but if I double click I can see it open running in the background.

It‚Äôs has all the exciting highlights I really enjoyed knowing. And tags extra reading as well and they are helpful. Most of all the pictures to show how baby is growing
1534,1534,5,2021-07-14T12:45:44.000Z,marie0816,Highly recommend!,This app helped me through my entire pregnancy and after! It shows you size and details about the baby(ies) and what you and your body are going through. There are helpful articles and you can search topics as well!

This app been the best for me starting from pregnancy and with my baby. It show‚Äôs you the milestones and solutions to everything you can think of. Must have!"
1538,1538,5,2021-04-07T10:55:37.000Z,IntlSpanishGirl,New version not as good,"I loved this app before, but now when I open it, the current day doesn't appear. It opens to the first day of the new ""week"" and then it's annoying to have to scroll down to the correct day. Please fix this so it opens to the current day. Thanks!"
1539,1539,4,2021-05-07T13:16:29.000Z,Lmjboogie,Good but navigation needs fixing,"Information is good and I like the birth club chat feature. However, it‚Äôs hard to navigate back to the forum once you select a topic in the birth club chat. Let‚Äôs say your on page two, it takes you all the way back to the beginning. Fix that and I would give it 5 stars."
1540,1540,5,2021-03-07T02:59:48.000Z,jillianraygoza,Great app! Easy to use!,Highly recommend this app for any pregnant women. It‚Äôs very easy and if you don‚Äôt know your due date then you can go ahead and enter when was the last menstrual cycle so it was just a lot more convenient and a lot more easier than other apps
1541,1541,5,2021-01-20T04:26:37.000Z,allisonmaemamaof1,Peace of Mind,This app pulls together moms that are going through the same things around the same time. It gave me peace of mind knowing I wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong. It‚Äôs always one step ahead. For example: I started wondering about rolling and soon enough there were articles on that very topic.
1542,1542,5,2021-01-12T21:24:09.000Z,Zionnahmarie,Great Pregnancy App,This app is full of beneficial information and it‚Äôs fun to read and post comments/questions for your birth month group. The best part is reading posts and getting great advise from other expecting moms. It‚Äôs also amazing to follow your progress along with the apps week by week growth chart.
1543,1543,5,2021-01-07T15:09:09.000Z,Katie Farah,Baby counter app is love,"During my pregnancy, this app really helped me everything. I didn‚Äôt need to worry about what should I do? what is happening to me? What should I buy for hospital bag that kinda details. This app was my life box during that time. I would recommend to everyone who is expecting."
1544,1544,5,2020-12-25T04:09:54.000Z,asaacg,Love it!,"I was looking for an app that tracked all the things throughout my pregnancy. When I found this one and checked it out, it had literally everything I wanted/needed to know about my pregnancy. If not only tracked the baby, it kept track of things for mommy as well. It was all to a T. I love it!!"
1545,1545,4,2020-12-27T02:26:22.000Z,College Girl on spring break,Wonderful but could have better layout,It‚Äôs still a bit confusing to me after using it for about 2 months how to get to the aspect I‚Äôm looking for. I click different buttons until I eventually find the page I‚Äôm looking for. Could have a better layout to find things easier.
1546,1546,5,2020-12-24T15:52:02.000Z,09150sunshine,Third times the charm!,I‚Äôve tried two other pregnancy apps before landing on this one.  I enjoy how organized and informative the content is.  I also love the ‚ÄúMy Bump‚Äù feature where you can take three pictures a week to record your physical changes.
1547,1547,5,2020-12-18T16:23:03.000Z,Kagomlette,Love this app,"I like this app because I didn‚Äôt have to pay for a subscription and I got all the cute information about the baby; size, how it‚Äôs growing. Another great thing is all the helpful info for mom and all the symptoms you can experience. It is very informative and just well rounded."
1548,1548,5,2020-12-09T14:18:15.000Z,RLB4JC,Great app!,I‚Äôve used this app for 3 out of 4 pregnancies and I love it. It takes the guesswork out of what phase of pregnancy you‚Äôre going through and let‚Äôs you know what‚Äôs next. I also love that it follows the baby‚Äôs development from birth through one year. I‚Äôve tried others and BabyCenter is my fave! üíó
1549,1549,5,2020-12-01T22:48:05.000Z,Nalil,Can‚Äôt imagine having gone this far without it,"First time mom, never had any babies in my surroundings ever. I don‚Äôt think I can survive without the helpful weekly information since the beginning of my pregnancy. Now my son is almost 2 years old. I can‚Äôt be more grateful!"

I recommend and expecting mother get this app. I check mine every Wednesday to see what he/she looks like and to see what my body should be experiencing!
1551,1551,5,2020-11-15T17:53:33.000Z,Esko_Rob,I‚Äôve used Baby Center with all 3 of my girls!,I love Baby Center during pregnancy and after the baby is born. I‚Äôve used it since I was pregnant with my first who‚Äôs 12 now. They are pretty much on track with prenatal development and your growing child.  It‚Äôs worth having Baby Center as a guide and to find groups alike.
1552,1552,5,2020-11-13T19:11:39.000Z,Omi Selet,Love,This is app is great for all types of moms whether you‚Äôre a new mom or not it will help you keep track with how far you are for you and also help you learn many things about pregnancy and babies and parenting.

1553,1553,5,2020-11-05T18:48:45.000Z,Colleenyy,I love this app,I am on this app every day. I love that once I became pregnant I was able to join a group with a countless number of other ladies who are due the same time as me and are all going through similar situations. I get lots of questions answered on this app and it‚Äôs definitely user friendly!
1554,1554,5,2020-11-05T15:08:05.000Z,DreaPennycooke,Love this app!,This is my 2nd time around using the baby center app. I love being able to see/understand the week by week tracking of baby and the changes in my body.

And being about to talk to other women that are going through the same things has been awesome. I definitely don‚Äôt feel alone especially with covid-19 going on.
1557,1557,2,2020-05-07T12:16:12.000Z,7648063pleasework,Update is awful,"This update completely changed the app experience for me. I would previously have given five stars, but this update makes the app impossible to use. Nothing loads, it takes about two days after my week switches over to view my baby, and the articles don‚Äôt switch from day to day. So disappointed. I used this app with my daughter and planned to with this pregnancy as well. Please go back to the old design :("
1558,1558,5,2019-11-18T13:42:42.000Z,Skittlehead972,Love It!,"I absolutely love this app, it was very accurate during my pregnancy gave me helpful tips along the way. I loved how even after I had my baby the baby app still helps me keep track of my baby‚Äôs growth. All the extra tools that are available are just an added bonus."
1559,1559,5,2019-11-15T06:14:52.000Z,NewMommyAndLovingIt,Using this app again on my Second Pregnancy!,"I used this app with my first pregnancy, and now that I‚Äôm pregnant with my second I‚Äôm using it again. It‚Äôs just so helpful and keeps you on track and well informed of baby as well as my development. It‚Äôs so easy to use track and log.  Love it!"
1560,1560,5,2019-06-05T00:18:03.000Z,Hannahbree,Amazing app!,"I‚Äôve used this app throughout my entire pregnancy. It‚Äôs been able to answer almost every question I‚Äôve had, and didn‚Äôt know I had! I check it everyday to keep up to date on my baby‚Äôs progress. I love the tools too, especially the bumpie section :)"
1561,1561,5,2019-11-12T13:53:59.000Z,TheRealNoemi,Just what I neededü•∞,Very informative and one does not have to go on a hunt search to look for detailed information about the baby‚Äôs development for the week you‚Äôre in(üôåüèæ) or to learn about symptoms one may be experiencing. -Yes this was an issue with other appsüôÑ-. Highly recommend üëçüèæ. God bless! Thanks BabyCenter!
1562,1562,5,2019-10-24T03:09:26.000Z,GabinaEspCortes,Loved it.,I used it for both my pregnancies. Very informative and easy to use. They have forums and mommy group chats to help out new mommies or if you‚Äôre just wonder other mom ideas. I especially loved the videos and tips that are also available on the app. Definitely recommend
1563,1563,5,2019-10-15T16:04:28.000Z,Southernmocha.xo,Love it!,Every week it is something for you to learn about your baby. Great tips and ideas to help your baby brain grow. I love how I can keep up every month with pictures of my baby growth. I‚Äôve had this app every since I found out I was having my bundle of joy. Must get this app!!
1564,1564,5,2019-07-05T16:04:28.000Z,Tyler Wasabi,Love it,I love this app. It‚Äôs functional and serves an amazing purpose. I have learned so much from it. I love the week by week pregnancy updates.
1565,1565,2,2019-09-25T17:04:15.000Z,starkitty13,Slightly less than ok,Really haven‚Äôt found an app that is good. This one is ok for tidbits of development info but the articles are terrible! It‚Äôs fear mongering! It treats pregnant women like we can‚Äôt make our own decisions and that we should live in a hamster ball away from the dangers of the real world. It‚Äôs terrible and annoying. The community is just ok. There are some great legitimate questions and only some good advise. You‚Äôre better off reading a book or listening to your doctor to get advise.
1566,1566,5,2019-06-12T03:57:20.000Z,destinyymichellee,Wonderful,"Using this while pregnant with my first child and it‚Äôs everything I could‚Äôve asked for! Updates on baby size, movement, what to expect and everything every week. Lots of videos and pictures that are very descriptive I definitely recommend!"
1567,1567,1,2019-07-03T19:08:34.000Z,delafrancia,Community filled with negative women,"The app has useful tips and information along your pregnancy, but the community aspect of this site is filled with negative opinionated women. It‚Äôs not a safe space to post even your own opinions or concerns without getting attacked from women who aren‚Äôt kind and don‚Äôt respect other people‚Äôs feelings or ways of doing things. Other apps aren‚Äôt as catty as this one. The purpose is to support each other, not to assert your entitled, self-righteous thoughts as the absolute truth and the only way to take care of your child."
1568,1568,5,2019-06-10T17:06:19.000Z,ishababi,love it and informative,gives you articles to read on development daily polls for pregnancy love that I can see what other mothers think on certain issues. tells you the things your baby has the ability to do week to week great app
1569,1569,3,2019-06-11T01:58:39.000Z,KaitlinG1987,An important glitch that has me looking for other apps.,The tools that I use such as the growth tracker is not even there anymore. This is because the tools section has had a glitch for some time now. It‚Äôs forcing me to find a different app to track my baby‚Äôs growth. Unfortunate because I really like this app and have used it my whole pregnancy and would like to continue to now that she‚Äôs born.
1570,1570,5,2018-08-07T21:22:28.000Z,BabyAverysMomma,Awesome !!,Our healthcare provider suggested this app during my pregnancy and I love that it continues into postpartum. It always brings up a topic right as we run into it and if it doesn't I love that I can always find a similar question with answers from other mothers. I would recommend to everyone !
1571,1571,5,2018-09-02T18:44:38.000Z,Saaammmmyyyyy,Best App Ever!!,Love this app. So much useful and helpful info while you‚Äôre pregnant and even afterwards.

1573,1573,5,2018-12-30T16:16:18.000Z,Tjhende2,Super informative!,"Great app that has helped me to understand the growth of our little girl.  The push notifications aren‚Äôt obtrusive nor annoying, seeing that the information is relative and very interesting."

I also LOVE the weekly comparisons, although I think some aren‚Äôt quite right but that‚Äôs ok. I still love the 3D looking pictures. This is the app to get when tracking your pregnancy!"
1578,1578,5,2019-03-27T18:56:09.000Z,AlStKa,Great pregnancy app,"Love the app!! It gives me great advice, different views on things, and information about the best products for our little ones. I also really enjoy my week tracker and updates on what my baby should be doing now, growth, and sitting  positions of baby each week in my pregnancy."

This is my second pregnancy but it has been almost 7 years (May 30th) since the birth of my first, so it‚Äôs almost like brand new again. This will be helpful!"

I say entertained because I constantly found myself on the app more than on my personal social media platforms! It was fun to read all the articles, forums and watch all the interesting videos. Def recommend :)"

I can say this is the best application that exists for inform and teach you anything about pregnancy and baby... every time I read my reports and news is so accurate.
1583,1583,1,2018-03-10T14:17:59.000Z,dodd24,Threads Crash Constantly,"I‚Äôve looked at several different groups of interest, and in each one I can‚Äôt scroll beyond the first few posts most of the time. If I make it to a thread I‚Äôm interested in, I can‚Äôt get past a few comments without it all going blank. I guess I‚Äôll skip the ‚Äòcommunity‚Äô part, and just keep track of baby‚Äôs growth. Overall, I‚Äôm very disappointed. I‚Äôve used this app with 2 other pregnancies, and had similar issues, but few and far between. Overall, very disappointed."
1584,1584,1,2018-05-14T02:56:00.000Z,Trcrjocr,App isn‚Äôt letting me log in,After the update the app signed me out. I have entered my email and password but it says it is invalid.

It has improved the layout and provides great information on the progress of your baby developing . I really like the poll questions they ask too.

1599,1599,5,2021-04-08T21:17:17.000Z,Babieshelly,Best tracking app ever,I love the app so much. You can keep track of all of your babies wether it was born or miscarried. The video visuals of the baby and the stage the baby is in makes everything so realistic. On this app I learn something new about baby‚Äôs and what they do or what happens while being in the womb.
1600,1600,5,2021-03-16T12:05:22.000Z,Boy Mom Momica,Baby Center Review,We love this app! My 6 year-old loves checking the size fruit/vegetable that the baby is at the change of each week. We read it as a family and it helps us all to connect with the baby even more! We highly recommend this app!
1601,1601,4,2021-03-18T15:57:00.000Z,emkadava,So Fun!,"Using the birth club boards can be a bit clunky - when you comment on or view one and then go back, it puts you at the top not where you were previously at in the list. But otherwise it‚Äôs a lot of fun! Great way to track your pregnancy and connect with other mommas also due the same month as you!"
1602,1602,5,2021-03-13T04:14:55.000Z,Licia242,Really good app,I used this app for my first pregnancy 9 years ago and now I‚Äôm using it for my second. The app is very informative and literally has a section for everything you‚Äôd need and want to know during your pregnancy as well as the development of the baby after birth.
1603,1603,5,2021-02-02T14:56:22.000Z,KatC2020,Love!!!,This has been such a great sight to keep me up on relevant information about my babies growth.  The articles are great about covering all the different feelings and questions going through a parents head.  I also love that it knows exactly how old my baby is and caters to that important info!

I love it! I‚Äôve had this app sense I was 9 weeks pregnant & now my baby is 9 months old & I still use it. Many features along with it & groups.
1607,1607,5,2021-01-04T17:46:00.000Z,Bad Memories Kay,Recommend,I love this app and definitely recommend it! I used it throughout both of my pregnancies and still use it to keep track of my children's growth progress. I wish it‚Äôd let you enter stats over 2 years old but other than that I love it.
1608,1608,5,2021-01-03T02:12:42.000Z,jpcuster,Great tracker to have!,This app helps me to learn so much more beneficial information about my child‚Äôs milestones and development.

1609,1609,5,2020-12-25T16:40:18.000Z,Baby J's Momma,Baby‚Äôs journey,"Love this app, give a lot of good info on what you should expect during your weeks of pregnancy, fun facts about what baby is doing inside the womb and a comparison of the size of your baby. My little ones love checking in every week to see what‚Äôs new with their new little sibling."
1610,1610,5,2020-12-24T14:20:01.000Z,AngelaC25,A nessesity,"I consider myself very paranoid, this app really helps distinguish what is normal and what is not normal, it shares lots of important knowledge from when you‚Äôre pregnant even after the baby is born. It‚Äôs really made my new life as a mom much less stressful. ‚ù§Ô∏è especially with the tools it offers, my favorite is the lullabies. üòç"

1612,1612,5,2020-12-21T04:57:10.000Z,nesabay,Go to Pregnancy App,It‚Äôs the best app for pregnancy information.  It shows you the size of the baby as well as the changes happening to the baby and your body.  I also love the easy access to the birth forums.  They have a ton of useful articles.  Very user friendly and informative.

There are so many articles and links that you can go to from this app to really find what is best for you and your baby.
1614,1614,1,2020-12-14T06:01:31.000Z,Skyyy415,Horrible quality,I joined the app to see what my baby looks like I thought it would be one of those cool 3D apps that I could see better features but it‚Äôs just basic pictures I could get off google. Plus the group chat is FULL OF KARENS ü§®ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. A lot of the ladies on this app already had their babies or lost theirs and still on the chat wanting everyone to feel as bad as their life is going üôÑ. DONT WAIST YOUR TIME with this app. Unless you are seriously bored with your life and like to argue. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PREGNANCY+ better app for expecting mommies üòã

Maybe I‚Äôm just pregnant lol but they mean a lot! I love the articles and they have so many creative tools to tinker with. You can keep up with virtually everything post pregnancy and during. I recommend! 5/5
1637,1637,3,2019-09-04T17:55:32.000Z,Jackieamb3r,Good but not great,It‚Äôs a good app with lots of information. However recently I‚Äôve experienced app crashes and all my ‚Äúbumpies‚Äù have disappeared. I also noticed that because I skipped a week for my bumpie photo the slide show got cut off at the week I skipped the photo and didn‚Äôt continue to go past that week. Maybe I did something wrong with that. Doesn‚Äôt matter anyways now they all are lost.

The main downfall is that you are not able to edit any entry‚Äôs you make in the baby‚Äôs growth tracker. It‚Äôs pretty much a pain to fix because you have to delete the baby from the profile then re-enter everything all over again.
1654,1654,5,2017-11-06T18:47:21.000Z,Vinks08,One of my favorites,"I love that this app gives me little tidbits to read each day. The initial phases of pregnancy are worrisome.

I loved learning what each week brought, what was developing, and helpful tips. Now it helps with his growth and each milestone he is reaching. Thank you!"
1678,1678,5,2020-11-07T12:48:50.000Z,dtora001,Really wonderful information; wish there were a little more diversity,This is a really great and useful app for me and my partner. My only feedback would be that it would be great to see a little more cultural diversity in the people and perspectives that they feature. Otherwise really awesome.
1679,1679,2,2020-08-01T02:55:33.000Z,Briavlond,Inaccurate dates and weeks,I have been trying to track my pregnancy through this app but found discrepancies when it comes to the dates and weeks attached.  For example The app says that July 24-30 I would be sixteen weeks but the todays date is July 31st which put me at the beginning of my 17 weeks.  So i believe it would be helpful to help explain that a bit more especially for first time moms like me who are learning all of this.
1680,1680,5,2020-07-23T19:10:22.000Z,Teetee28,Love this awesome family tracker,Keeps up with months weeks and things that go on with in that time the measurements your baby may or or may not be but expected to be the app make you feel very comfortable and I love that you can talk to other moms about your pregnancy process

I highly recommend Baby Center app"

1685,1685,2,2020-05-20T02:01:22.000Z,Smithy 1234,Why the change?,"The entire app was just changed and I do not think it was for the better. The highlights, and info about baby and mom at the top won‚Äôt even open, so actually it doesn‚Äôt tell me anything now. Before there were polls I enjoyed doing and other information throughout the week, it seemed like there was a lot of articles and info. Now I see one article on how to get a free breast pump... which I don‚Äôt need so... Not a good change."

1689,1689,3,2019-08-13T03:22:44.000Z,Jazzjazzjj,Confusing,"I am trying to give this app a chance and as a first time mom, I would love the helpful information.  However,  I don't understand why the app keeps suggesting I take quizzes or read articles to see if I'm pregnant.  I literally have on the app that I'm pregnant and the number of weeks I am.  This makes me feel like it's not customized but instead a bunch of random articles and facts."

Super easy to navigate   I love how the information is displayed. My only wish is that they would provide information about multiples. I am pregnant with triplets and this app, no app, gives accurate information about my pregnancy. If it did, I would give 5 stars."
1694,1694,1,2019-01-30T20:38:28.000Z,Will Clarke,"Good content, horrible log in experience","There is a lot of good content in this app, but you have to constantly re-log in to it. Literally every day if you reopen the app, you have to re-enter your email address and password. It is infuriating. Other apps have figured this out. I don‚Äôt understand why they haven‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been like this for months with no improvement. I‚Äôve tried emailing them about the issue and they say they are aware of it but they don‚Äôt seem to be doing anything to fix it."

I feel like this app could give more light to the home birth hopeful and also let the expecting mom know she has a choice with everything (specifically the antibiotics and hep B shot right after birth) It feels as most of the advise given is for the mother to be a good patient for the doctor rather than the other way around.

1858,1858,1,2020-04-19T16:08:23.000Z,cupcake356798,Worst baby app ever,This app is full of moms who bully other moms and the app fails to reprimand them for their nasty attitudes towards others but when someone tries to tell them something then the app acts against those who choose to defend themselves against these nasty women. I reported these women and then I got a warning from the app saying they would DELETE MY ACCOUNT for defending myself against them! I told them to go ahead and delete!  If I could give zero stars I would. I will be using the What To Expect app for my next pregnancies.

1888,1888,3,2021-05-05T14:28:37.000Z,Jre07,Overall good,Overall this app is good. I love how it shows how big the baby is week by week with little facts about the growing baby. It posts good articles. I like the chat groups of women who are due about the same time. One of the big complaints that I have is the weekly videos won‚Äôt load. They constantly get stuck on the ads prior to the actual video.

I d o not like the weekly baby comparisons to food. I don‚Äôt get it. How can baby be the size of a butternut squash one week and be smaller the next week as a coconut? Plus the image of the growing belly is so small. I found myself comparing myself to that image and feeling very bad that my tummy was so much bigger.

Then when I go to the app and the daily reads finally do come up, I can't click on the to read them. I can scroll of the page but it's like it's frozen. If the update was for bug fixes it didn't work, it just mad it worse. There was nothing wrong with the app before."

1977,1977,1,2020-04-09T10:47:11.000Z,1111bear,Should be called Bully Center,"I‚Äôve never experienced cyber bullying until I joined Baby Center, which I now call Bully Center. The women on the forums are incredibly mean and attack other users constantly. Even worse, you don‚Äôt have control over your posts. So if you post something and get hundreds of hateful comments, you can‚Äôt even delete the post to stop the harassment! Stay far away from this app!! There are many other apps that have nicer members and better information."

1982,1982,3,2019-11-05T22:22:59.000Z,APMORELL,Some info is good some is dribble,There is some good info on here - but also misleading info like ‚Äúyour baby should get most of his nutrition from food‚Äù by the time they are 12 months which is completely wrong. Babies should not drop a night time milk feeding because they are constantly growing and it‚Äôs rare that a baby will self-wean from breastfeeding prior to two years. UPDATE your info!

But they don‚Äôt care about that, they care about cramming their app with as many ads as possible so that it constantly lags and randomly refreshes while you are in the middle of reading a post or trying to comment. I hate this app so much and I was once a long time user who loved it. Do better babycenter and listen to your users. This update is awful."

Most the women on here are very rude and very very catty. The staff doesn‚Äôt ever seem to regulate the bullying on it too. They‚Äôll chime in and laugh. If you‚Äôre a first time mom or a pregnant mom just looking for some answers you‚Äôre better off googling it because the women on this app are cut throat and it‚Äôs all they do all day is make other pregnant moms feel bad and the staff does a horrible job handling the harassment and hate speech.

2168,2168,1,2020-11-30T19:46:20.000Z,Lex100199,Full Of Bullies.,"Worse than some Facebook mom groups. And the ‚Äúgroup owners‚Äù are the worst ones. Plus you can‚Äôt turn off notifications for a post, you can‚Äôt delete posts, and you can‚Äôt block or ignore group owners. So if there‚Äôs a post you‚Äôve made that‚Äôs filling up with bullies in the comments, there‚Äôs no way to stop seeing it or to delete it. The overall app is fine I guess aside from some glitches with Bumpie, but it is NOT a supportive environment, especially for first time moms."

Now that I‚Äôm using it with my 3rd it states that I‚Äôm 2 months pregnant when I‚Äôm about to be 13weeks. Obviously I‚Äôm about to be 4 months soon! Thats not a minor issue and should be fixed. I see my reviews on this app is being deleted. Not sure why when its an mistake on their end. I‚Äôm not the only one pointing out the obvious of this app putting the wrong age or month.
2179,2179,3,2020-05-18T08:46:48.000Z,Momma Q20,Good for information,I like the app because it gives another source for information during your pregnancy however since using it the calculation for my due date is now off and it keeps logging me out of the app which is frustrating when attempting to use the tools to such as timing contractions that it offers

The only major complaint I have is that I cannot upload or scroll through my bumpie gallery without the app shutting down 5 times first. Once I finally can upload the photo, I try to scroll through them to see my progress/growth, and it closes down EVERY time. This is highly frustrating. Please fix this! Otherwise, good app. Thank you!"

You also have to log on again every single time you close the app, even if it's still running in the background of your phone. Not very user friendly or convenient, was hoping an upgrade would fix but so far no luck."

While I joined the app to provide education after a 16yr gap in pregnancy, I found a site that allowed their conservative moderators to monopolize and troll other women.

The moderators gang up and report you if you stick up for others and come at them just as they come at other women."

The slideshow feature doesn‚Äôt work and consistently only shows weeks 12-16 then stops (I‚Äôm 35 weeks). App frequently crashes and suddenly shuts down. I have the latest version downloaded so I‚Äôm not sure what the problem is. Don‚Äôt use app if you want a safe place to keep bumpies."

This app has cows milk given BST under the safe category. COWS MILK. Filtered puss with hormones that doesn't belong in the stomach of humans except baby cows, disgusting. How can an app like this promote such false information. Yet a vegetarian or vegan diet was not put under the safe category? Im sorry I didn't know a plant based diet of mostly vegetables is more harmful than downing animal milk during pregnancy."

I like the notifications and that it tells you what happens in your womb every week but I wish it was designed for moms with multiples. Also the bump photo part could be more fun and cuter.

But the app is missing this crucial component which so many expecting mothers would use.

2415,2415,5,2019-12-05T15:53:19.000Z,bcjnik,Feedback,"I love it. I have a suggestion. It would be nice for parents with multiple children to get a combined newsletter with all the info for their children of different ages, instead of getting separate emails delivered also at separate dates."
2416,2416,5,2019-08-20T15:08:18.000Z,LauraBoraW,Useful info,"I like each article, it‚Äôs not just the same recycled facts and tips that you get from other baby sites. Also, it‚Äôs useful info for during your pregnancy and post partum. When you‚Äôre actually raising your baby!"

What I wish I saw more of however are articles that spend some time on when pregnancy isn‚Äôt perfect- why c sections occur, prepping for repeat cesarean, and other late pregnancy risks that moms should be aware of. Even a little info here and there would be helpful and educational.  It would be valuable for a large number of users."
2420,2420,1,2018-07-03T09:51:14.000Z,4205799754588654,Crashes,"Really liked this app until it started crashing on the 3D view of the baby. Frustrated me so much because it does it every single time now. I refuse to use this app until you fix it, it‚Äôs annoying af. Get it together developers, you have one job to do and that‚Äôs get the dam app to work or else you‚Äôre a failure. And I‚Äôm not the only one mad about it in the reviews, there are several more here so apparently the developers just don‚Äôt give a sht. Way to go."

2441,2441,3,2017-10-14T15:08:56.000Z,wyomato,Outdated,"Great app but could use some love. Many of the articles are outdated. For example, Neuchal Translucency tests and Chorionic Villus sampling have been largely replaced with a simple blood draw to screen for birth defects and determine baby‚Äôs gender. Maternity clothing from Liz Lange is no longer available at Target. Overall the information is interesting but not always accurate or relevant because it‚Äôs frequently outdated."

They were sometimes confusing and did not always make sense. At times the veggie/fruit from the prior weeks occasionally looked bigger.

Even though the app was cleared or reset push through alerts kept coming through reminding me what week I would‚Äôve been on in my pregnancy. Finally I just deleted the app. I have several other pregnancy apps downloaded to my phone and not only are they sensitive to loss but they offer information and support for pregnancy loss.

Which makes pregnancy more comfortable to be able to have people that relate to you and give you advice. However, as other comments have said. The app is just about useless in this sense once you hit roughly 13.5 weeks. Unless you pay for the extension, you can‚Äôt comment, post, etc."

2573,2573,5,2020-10-02T13:06:22.000Z,age dont matter,Baby Davina,Absolutely fantastic app loved the comparisons of baby‚Äôs growth to vegetables and all the great information that was giving in such a broad spectrum from nutrition to gestational diabetes to pre-clamp Sia and more..I loved watching my baby grow..It was nice getting notifications as well..Prego mind took its toll for sure...

They have them all and if not on the app you can go to the website for All ages of children advice. I love the polls its my favorite part.
2578,2578,3,2020-06-22T18:56:35.000Z,theeleyfam,App was better before the update,I prefer the way the app was before. It‚Äôs hard to find what you‚Äôre looking for. The weekly update of changes that are sent to my email are nice... but they used to be right on the app. I have yet to find them on the app. I‚Äôll likely check my email updates instead of using this app
2579,2579,3,2020-06-12T22:31:01.000Z,Megslack,Comprehensive and helpful,"I have a baby book that has helped me to know what to expect, but this app in addition to the book have helped me have a more narrow focus based on what trimester I'm in. Love it!"

2581,2581,2,2020-05-15T13:56:32.000Z,keenaLynn,Disappointed 2nd time around,"This app was so wonderful when i used it 2 years ago. Now, the countdown, supporting articles & gestational weeks do not match. It will say how big the baby is(a week behind) butter current week of pregnancy is a week ahead. Hope they figure it out because it truly was a great app for a first time mom. Switching to a better app that has the bugs figured out."
2582,2582,5,2020-02-26T18:42:45.000Z,heinzcp,Amazing!!,I look forward to all the little snippets of info that babycenter will share about my children‚Äôs development. I feel more aware and connected to their growth and how to maximize my interactions as well as their exposure to the world as they grow!
2583,2583,2,2020-03-14T18:01:45.000Z,CassieGirl8,I really want to like this app but...,"It won‚Äôt stop crashing!! It drives me nuts! I have uploaded pictures into my bumpie gallery through this whole pregnancy and I can never go in to look at them. The app immediately just crashes and it‚Äôs very frustrating. I try to take the polls and once I hit submit for my answer, it just spins and won‚Äôt submit my answer. FRUSTRATING FRUSTRATING FRUSTRATING!!! I wish they would fix it."

2587,2587,5,2019-12-08T13:26:00.000Z,NatMY,More interesting than pregnancy books,I find that the short day by day and week by week information is more realistic than trying to find time to read a ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù book. Great app.

But beware of the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù aspect of this site/app. There is a TON of judgment and snarky comments happening here, basically void of support and encouragement. Also highly dislike that they make it so difficult to delete your account. Even with the helpful info and avoiding the community I‚Äôm still choosing to stay away from this app/site. I simply cannot support the harassment and bullying that is allowed here by BabyCenter and it‚Äôs leaders."

Every time you open it you have to scroll up, past old articles. The information is not updated often. The food used to illustrate baby‚Äôs size are odd and don‚Äôt seem to make sense. There is also no search feature for articles."
2611,2611,5,2018-05-10T00:01:36.000Z,Vastard!,Much more than expected,"A great source of information, and exciting to get a new batch of updates every week. Especially handy are the extra tools, such as the kick counter and contraction tracker. I haven't needed any other app for my pregnancy."

2617,2617,3,2018-07-24T05:41:47.000Z,AmyM R,Ok app,It‚Äôs a nice app for baby info but I wish they would fix the birth month or board in one place like in a tab you just click on and post or read versus what they have now it has to load and if you leave the app you have to reload each page. A built in place for birth months/groups would be great for this app.

I used it through my pregnancy, my lil guy is 7 mos old now and while I don‚Äôt use it as often now, I still turn to it when I have time."
2624,2624,2,2017-12-30T21:06:22.000Z,emmyjo312,Would love it if it didn‚Äôt still say I‚Äôm pregnant,"I use the app almost daily but it still irritates me that it won‚Äôt acknowledge my son‚Äôs birth.  It has his stats, sends me the right emails for his age, but the app still says I‚Äôm 40 weeks pregnant...4 months later.  Tried to ask for guidance fixing it and just kept getting the same instructions that I had done 30 times.  Hopefully someday an update will fix it"

2666,2666,3,2020-01-31T00:09:23.000Z,Nellywill1,Premie babies,It should have information for premature babies. Like if your due date is set and you have your baby before then. It should be able to tell that you have a premature baby and give you a whole different set of info for that. I have a penis but am reading things for a baby born full term and now the app feels useless.

Because the company that makes the flu shot says DO NOT USE WHILE PREGNANT. Oh but go ahead and listen to the OBGYN that recommends it because they get paid to administer it. I bet Baby Center gets a nice piece of cheddar too for polling their customers about taking the flu shot and recommending it. Shame..."

What you ‚Äúshould‚Äù be gaining, what your husband ‚Äúreally thinks‚Äù, and how/when to lose it. It‚Äôs honestly really disheartening because I do like this app, but they focus too heavily on this one area. Obviously weight is something to pay attention to but they take it way too far."

The women on this app are incredibly cruel, especially the group owners in the January 2021 birth club. Myself and others were bullied out of the group. As a first time mom I had no idea other mamas could be so cruel to one another. Baby center doesn‚Äôt monitor the group owners and their behavior even when bullying is being reported. If you are looking for a good app then check out what to expect. The mamas are lovely and welcoming."

There is so much bullying going on, I‚Äôve even seen group owners join in on it. You report the behavior, but nothing happens. They do nothing. I am deleting this app because of it. Still no option to block a thread, or delete a thread, and no option to delete your own account! You have to email them and request for your account to be closed! Ridiculous."

I had made a mistake imputing some information and they wouldn‚Äôt let me edit it. So deleting the profile was the only option. Well in doing that it deleted everything from my pregnancy as well. All my bumpies. All gone. Which I am very upset about. My husband and I have fertility issues so this very well could have been my only pregnancy and the app deleted it all.

While there seems to be plenty of helpful information and people have rated it highly for their experience, I am thoroughly disappointed that in this day and age every article and video seem to address the baby as a ‚Äúhe.‚Äù There‚Äôs no reason for that and I hope the app is updated to be more gender neutral and diverse."

Good luck."

3045,3045,3,2020-05-28T15:20:05.000Z,cvs143,Not the same,I loved the way Baby Center was before this new update. The dates are all wrong and it always gives me a blank page when I click to see the baby or belly size. I used it everyday until this update. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm the only one with this problem but It‚Äôs disappointing.
3046,3046,3,2020-05-17T16:28:45.000Z,glad to be me,Not a fan of update,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but I liked the old app better than with the new update. It was exciting that there was something new to look at each day, rather than the whole week being up at once. With the old app I would have rated 5 stars. Please bring it back."

Now the app has some kind of bug that closes every time I try to look at my previous bump pics. Also the little bumpie movie that the app makes won‚Äôt put the pictures in full screen mode like it used to. They are like super zoomed out. It‚Äôs very disappointing when just a couple years ago it worked great!"

However, I do not like that it switches the gender every single day. If there were a way to pick a preference of what you want the app to call your baby (him or her), that would be ideal. Consistency üíô thank you!"

However, you have to sign in every 24 hours which is super annoying. I wish they would change this feature."
3070,3070,2,2019-03-30T23:48:47.000Z,znab hdinehshsk,Need more applicable items for certain time frames,"It‚Äôs a nice app. I just wish that more items were applicable to the time frame of the pregnancy. There are too many times when I‚Äôm reading something or watching a video that‚Äôs posted for 7, 8, 9 weeks and they only all have to deal with week 20 or beyond. I find it distracting and sometimes frustrating."
3071,3071,5,2019-04-02T04:03:42.000Z,Kimmiko91,Love it,It was nice to know everything they've got and I felt less like a crazy person every time I had a question about something awkward or out of curiosity before and after pregnancy!

I can‚Äôt even access the bumpie photo album and when I tried to reinstall the app, I lost all the photos. Now I still can‚Äôt take any bumpie photo because saving will cause it to crash."
3076,3076,5,2019-07-03T07:43:22.000Z,lidron01,It‚Äôs an amazing app,"Like the app very much, it would even be better if you could keep the option for day view and month view separately."

However there are a bunch of bullies on there, and you see more women attacking other women rather than being supportive. So it‚Äôs gets a thumbs down for that, though I know it‚Äôs not really the apps fault. The women of that app just ruin it."
3081,3081,5,2018-11-13T17:02:46.000Z,KRZA3,Very informative,Informative at the right time frame. Encompasses pressing questions just when you will question things your baby will do soon or is doing and includes what is next.

3095,3095,1,2018-08-10T00:44:31.000Z,Lilliew,Community is Horrible,"The app, honestly, runs fine. However this is my 3rd attempt at giving BabyCenter a chance. Every time I‚Äôve left it. The community is horrible, awful and full of hate and cyber bullying. I am honestly baffled as how it has continued to be this way for at least the last 6 years. My heart breaks for the first time mom who looks for support on BabyCenter because she‚Äôll be met with nothing but cruel and hurtful comments. Done for good with this."

The awful part is the community section where you ask questions in hopes for helpful answers, you get shamed, judged, or harrassed! The Group Owners are often just as shameful and rude. Helpful comments or no comments at all in my opinion. Otherwise this app would get 5 stars!"

However, some and the articles and a lot of the little polls that they do exclude single moms. For example, today's poll asks how pregnancy is affecting my relationship and another asked how my partner feels about the gender. Thanks for reminding me I'm doing this alone? Just wish it was a bit more inclusive!"

Now, it‚Äôs so hard to get into my groups, I get zero notifications, and only sometimes can I post photos. It killed the group chat I was in because no one wants to deal with the hassle of scrolling through all the pages trying to find where they left off. Why did you have to change what wasn‚Äôt broken?"

I was excited about this app until I realized expecting and those who are already moms are some of the biggest bullies. You have kids you want to raise and up left yet you are in the process of tearing other women and moms down. Loved the app until i saw how rude and mean the majority of everyone is."

On one screen it tells me I‚Äôm 5 wks 4 days and the other says I‚Äôm 5 wks 5 days. Also, maybe consider that some of us went through IUI‚Äôs or IVF‚Äôs to get here it would be great if you could include that in your calculators. Really disappointed because for my first pregnancy this app was all I used."

3446,3446,1,2021-03-04T23:07:32.000Z,rebeccaRaeyay,I loved this app,"Not anymore. The most recent update has made it so the community boards that I‚Äôm following don‚Äôt keep you on the page you left off on and instead just automatically take you to the first page, why would I want to be on the first page every time I try to view my notifications for posts or pick up where I left off?! Used to be great, very sadly disappointing now."

3453,3453,1,2021-01-19T01:03:42.000Z,jennylove80,Needs a lot of work,"This app is absolutely worthless once your baby turns one.  Not sure why this company thinks I‚Äôm going to keep the app on my phone when once my baby turned one it stopped keeping track of his age and only wants me to enter a due date.  If this app is no longer going to track my toddler, why not make an app for parents of toddlers?,  instead of telling me to get pregnant again. Worthless."

Not so much.,"I enjoy the app. I also enjoy the idea of a community pregnancy board, but there is too much bullying and needless attacking that is left unchecked to consider it the safe place it is intended to be. It‚Äôs cool if you don‚Äôt mind that culture, but now that I know that the reality doesn‚Äôt match the advertising, I won‚Äôt be using this app or the community. I don‚Äôt like that this is advertised as a ‚Äúsafe and kind‚Äù environment when the unkindness is allowed to persist."

The message boards and birth clubs are full of the most vicious mom bullies I‚Äôve ever come across. They gang up on you and try to make you feel stupid and scared if you ask a question. Lots of bored, angry ladies using this app, from what I can tell. If you use it, STAY OFF THE MESSAGE BOARDS. Seriously. They do not harbor a positive environment whatsoever."

4244,4244,2,2020-08-28T03:44:41.000Z,YoungJC210,Annoyed,This app is not functional. It keeps starting over during kick counts. I shouldn‚Äôt have to leave my phone on that page for 2 hours for it to save the info. I keep it open and then swipe back to enter a kick and the page goes away or leaves that tracker to go back to main page. Ridiculous!

A couple of months ago they did an update that changed the whole thing. No more daily polls and articles now it‚Äôs pretty much a page that shows you how far along you are - that‚Äôs it! Now it‚Äôs terrible I hardly use it. Bring back the old app!!!!
4252,4252,2,2020-06-08T20:20:49.000Z,Ejs1983,Latest update stinks,"Ever since the last update, this app has sucked. I‚Äôve used it with my 3 previous pregnancies and was excited to use it again. Articles won‚Äôt load. When I click on your baby or your body nothing loads. I have great WiFi and these things should all pop right up. Very disappointing."

Maybe I don‚Äôt know how to access them on the updated version but the older one seemed to have more information and better accessibility.
4254,4254,5,2020-05-19T11:39:20.000Z,l. frias,Good and complete app,Much better update with only one day information. Because you don't get saturated with information with all the days together.

I also don‚Äôt like how I keep going into settings to put the gender and a profile picture and it won‚Äôt let me. I keep wondering if adding a gender will give me more specific information.

5570,5570,1,2019-02-06T04:15:22.000Z,Puerto Rican libra,Needs upgrades,I do not like how the app does not give you a option to create a profile with twins it‚Äôs only single pregnancies.  Also I do not like how the app keeps locking you out and locking your account making you wait 24 hours before you can sign back in. Over all yes the app is a big help on a lot of info. But a lot of upgrades need to be done as well.

I stayed connected to that club during my recent pregnancy and even though I have birth prematurely the app keeps prompting me to join the birth club of my baby‚Äôs birth month. I do not want to join that club I prefer to see posts from the club I actually ‚Äújoined‚Äù.

5801,5801,3,2018-02-25T07:15:47.000Z,CjMoonz,Needs improvement,What they compare your baby size to is ridiculous. Could BabyCenter not come up with more clever comparisons for size? WTH is a jicama? Every week is something odd! Some articles had misspellings too. App is alright but could be better.

6156,6156,1,2018-04-09T01:46:09.000Z,Future Mrs. H,"Constantly crashes, times out",Throughout the whole pregnancy I feel like the section on the app for the birth club will constantly not work and I have to restart it if I want to keep reading posts.

If someone calls out a bully they get overloaded with mean comments or comments that often times include ""Welcome to BabyCenter"" which highlight that this type of interaction is tolerated here. During pregnancy, women are often more sensitive and need support, and this app is not the place to go for that."

It has articles of 'Are you pregnant?' during the time where you should know if you are pregnant, like week 5. By this time if you don't know if you are pregnant you shouldn't be using this app."

6349,6349,2,2018-05-10T15:38:08.000Z,EmuSel,Leaves you hanging,Good app but for some cruel reason the developers assume that no one ever goes past 40 weeks. After you hit week 40 it automatically assumes your baby has been born. So those of us still waiting at 40/41 are left with a mean reminder and no way to continue taking bump photos.

It has been my least favorite pregnancy app. I feel 2 stars is generous. The forums are also full of vultures. Tons of women on there will gang up on another woman and pick her apart and tear her down. It's high school in the palm of your hand."

8646,8646,1,2018-02-26T19:19:38.000Z,Jen57484,Drama,Birth clubs are full of catty drama and judgment and it's so poorly monitored. They'll delete posts about a mom asking for a suggestion with her business but leave up posts telling a mom she's an awful mother for taking a vacation. The articles are great but the community is brutal. I feel so sorry for some of the women going there for support who are greeted with judgment.

9265,9265,1,2018-07-11T06:38:36.000Z,Red ninja girl,Stay away!!!,The articles are good but the forums are hellish. Started your baby on solids at 4 months? You‚Äôre going to make her fat. Waited until 6 months? You‚Äôre ignorant for not doing baby led weaning. Sleep training? You‚Äôre a neglectful mom that should have CPS called on her! And the moderators join in the bullying too. Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY!

9871,9871,1,2020-01-14T00:36:08.000Z,grrrrr1234567,Weeks counter is inaccurate,It‚Äôs clear whomever built in the weeks calculator has no idea how they count or date a pregnancy. It is wrong and does not match up to a single other app or counter. As an example it will count as 10w7d and then skip to 11w1d. Pregnancy would be correctly counted as 10w6d then go to 11w0d.

11363,11363,5,2018-02-11T02:28:50.000Z,Samantha8802,Great Until Baby is 1 Year Old‚Äîupdate!,"This app is awesome for expectant parents and post preggo parents up to a year old. The advice is sage and well researched, and the app has been my go-to for most things. My one complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt follow you after your baby turns 1. Why is that? I still receive all the same helpful emails about my now 15 month, 3 week old‚Äôs development and timeline, and when I click on an article in the email it takes me to that article-in the app. Where are the weekly updates in the app itself after a year? Where do I find all the valuable stuff in the email on the app? Right now the app is just stuck on the last week of my 11 month, week 4‚Äôs development (again, he‚Äôs really 15 months), with no way to search the app for other advice and articles appropriate to his age. Those highlights are still an important resource even after a kid turns one, folks. It‚Äôs not like parents suddenly need less advice at that one year mark. ;) When I try to go into the settings to see if I can change anything on my end (like if there‚Äôs a toggle I need to switch saying my baby is now over a year old), the app just crashes. If you ever do add an option where there are weekly articles and suggested reads after a year, could you also please add a function where the app can follow two kids? My husband and I have been talking about baby 2, and it would be great to get advice, reminders and articles about BOTH kids: baby 1 alongside updates about what my pregnancy/new baby should be doing, and what I should be up to. For now, I‚Äôll for sure be resetting the app with baby 2‚Äôs due date once the time comes to keep up with all the good pregnancy advice again."

The community part is overly dramatic and not well maintained. I read comments of women bashing other woman so hard I want to cry for them. It‚Äôs disgusting and way to dramatic.

16929,16929,1,2020-02-03T20:09:22.000Z,labtech05,Infuriating,Members are allowed to send threatening messages with no real consequences. Email verification would reduce the trolls but they refuse to implement this because it would reduce their member count and subsequent ad revenue. They are driven by greed instead of member safety. Shameful.

Many who are not first time moms, and can help you with their past experience. The app itself follows every week, giving information about baby development each week. Which is both cute and extremely helpful. For a first time mom, it helped with the worries. It gives you lists of helpful things, like when it‚Äôs a good idea to go to a doctor. When to buy nursery stuff, what to put in your hospital bag etc. I love it."

19590,19590,1,2018-11-30T04:27:48.000Z,SkyApreg,Horrible user experience,"The app could be great if the developers can fix all the annoying horrible issues that are driving me nuts. It consistently makes me login over and over again. When I first downloaded the app months ago, every single time I clicked in the app it would make me enter both my email and password again and it didn‚Äôt even attempt to auto fill my email. Finally, after having to type in my email and password daily for weeks, it retained the info but I was using it less frequently as a result. After some time with no issue logging in (finally), it just happened again. I couldn‚Äôt remember my password and had to reset it... and the link to reset would not work at first because the cookies appear to have remembered where I left off so I had to go back and close the app in order for the reset to work. Right Before it logged me out for no reason I had a great birthing video up that I wanted to show my husband when he returned from work. The app does not allow you to share or forward videos so my only choice was to wait for my husband to come home to show him this video and then this whole password reset made the placeholder I left disappear and the video lost. I am so frustrated with this experience... the ‚Äú What to Expect‚Äù app is way better as I have never had to reset my password and I am able to easily forward videos on it if I want to. This app has a few cool features but all these issues make it super frustrating to use otherwise.... this was my last straw. I have given this app plenty of chances and I‚Äôm done being frustrated for no reason when this should be a pleasant experience looking at a baby app..."

But the ‚Äúbirth clubs‚Äù drag it down to a 1 Star (should be 0). There are quite a few VERY friendly women that you will meet who do actually care and want to offer their advice and experiences if you ask for it. I met quite a few who lived locally and we all even got together for lunches (and still do, to this day)."
