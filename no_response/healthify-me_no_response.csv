Healthify studio brings in the expert coach home to get you fit and strong.  I love the features of the app and am a great fan.  The health records enable one to quantify progress made over time on key parameters, tracking health progress with proper diet and exercise .  A supporting tool for all who wish to make drastic improvements to pave way for great health and fitness . What endears me the most is the new feature -  ‘insights’ that provides info on micro and macro nutrients after each meal, day after day informing and enabling the  actions that can be taken to improve health.  I live all the features of the app that inspires, informs, motivates and easily the best to gain and achieve great health results ."
1,1,1,2019-05-03T07:08:14.000Z,SubuhiS,Barely average,When you open the app it recommends you buy the Smart Plan - a daily meal plan. You cannot really see anything before you purchase the plan and once you’ve paid you’ll realise it does not provide any recipes just names dishes and gives nutritional information. For example the veg sandwich - what vegetables am I supposed to add for it to get the number of calories the app requires?
2,2,5,2020-03-24T06:53:50.000Z,Ashish Kole,Not leveraging all my Apple Health Data,"I see that there are a bunch of trackers included in the app. Many of these are already being recorded into Apple Health app using various other apps. Specifically, I record my water consumption using WaterMinder which in turn stored the information into Apple Health. My weight (and a bunch of other parameters) is recorded using Xiaomi’s Body Composition Scale and Mi Fit app, which in turn stores the same into Apple Health. My BP is recorded using Omron’s BP monitor and app, which stores the information into Apple Health. Most importantly, a plethora of information is collected by my Apple Watch and stored into Apple Health."
3,3,4,2020-08-12T14:12:39.000Z,myonecent,Great app. Some basic features could be free though,It’s great that we can track calories on this app and there are a wide range of Indian dishes here which really aren’t there on any other apps because most of them aren’t Indian apps. But it would be really great if the adding a custom meal is not a paid feature.
4,4,5,2019-07-26T16:11:42.000Z,Jyo1004,"Not just an app, but the system of discipline","Though I practice yoga and vegetarian food habits & very saatvik lifestyle, I am not a health freak. When my body health went slightly out of control, I have downloaded this app; and within a week, Healthifyme has brought me back in track and disciplined my daily food regime. Ria is an excellent source of feedback and knowledge. Due to this disciplined approach, I have lost 8 kgs and went back to my normal self. Over the time, one enjoys entering details of what he or she has eaten, everyday and becomes conscious of what’s good and what’s not good, what are good calories and what are bad calories. That’s what I love about this app. Yes, I had very miserable time with the nutritionist. None of them were prompt and consistent."
5,5,1,2019-06-15T05:47:21.000Z,Just PK,Tech and customer service is pathetic,On my first ever connect with them I became a paid user. Within 5 min...
6,6,5,2019-08-09T05:31:38.000Z,thahir81,Effective if tracked religiously,"I have been using the app religiously for the past year. Initially along with few exercises, I was able to come down from 79 kg to 65 kg in 6 months. I track every food and drink that I consume. Exercises are also tracked. Keeping track and seeing the excess calories you tend to take some days reminds you of your target goal. This app surprisingly has almost all the food in the database, even the very rare ones you think may not be there. I recommend this app to those who plan to bring down their weight. I must also say that simply controlling your calorie intake alone will not help. You definitely have to do some form of exercises as well for faster change."
7,7,5,2018-10-04T13:53:30.000Z,Odusk,One of the best apps for diet monitoring,"This is an excellent app. Has a huge database for all cuisines, specially with Indian names which is hard to find on so last apps or platforms. In short I can say this app seems to be google of food. Not sure about the calorie count and it’s accuracy though most of the dishes/ food seem to have the correct nutritional facts."
8,8,1,2020-08-06T09:38:22.000Z,shilpa 1989,Pathetic service provider,"I am currently using there premium program but not getting proper assistance..each and everyone whether it’s coach or a customer care executive not giving proper guidance..if I start chatting with customer care executives they reply after long waits and also it takes whole day or sometime 2 days to resolve or reply for some questions and problems..top of them my fitness coach, whenever I schedule any call he will never be on time and only after 1 try they drop you a email that he tried and couldn’t reach me out..is this any kind of joke?..the call got disconnected after picking up the call and he is saying he couldn’t reach me..booking a call is also not a easy task..sometimes they are on leave and sometimes the call slots are not Available for whole week..investigating money on this was my biggest mistake..I will never ever subscribe this again neither recommend to anyone.."
9,9,1,2019-11-05T00:34:02.000Z,Siddharth953,Customer service is a joke,"A product is nothing without good customer service, and these guys take the icing on the cake for it. On top of multiple ""technical errors"",  the support usually replies after 10-20 minutes, and nobody is crazy enough to sit there for that long with an open screen. I paid 200 AUD without any clarification of the amount because on the app it said 143 dollars so i assumed i was paying the same. When i found out i requested a cancellation and refund as soon as i purchased. And there starts three days of stress and me wondering whether these guys just ripped me off of my money. No response from the customer service at all, no clarification as to where the hell my money is. As of this day, my i am still waiting for my refund. It has been three days since i requested the cancellation, which should be otherwise done on the same day if there was such a thing as good customer service."
10,10,5,2018-09-22T04:02:41.000Z,Suvendu_Hal,Healthy app,I have to say that the app inspired me to start walking everyday and looking after my diet. I lost 1 kg in 9 days but more importantly I am feeling more energetic. For reference I am 49 years of age and have an office job.
11,11,5,2019-09-17T09:56:15.000Z,ManjuNautiyal,ManjuNautiyal,"Informative ,easy to use,provides analysis on the nutrient value of calories consumed ,its easy to keep track of calories taken in at every meal ,helps balance calorie intake for different meals as in breakfast morning snack lunch etc ,I became more aware of the caloric and nutrient value of the various food items I mindlessly use to consume earlier ! I still indulge in junk food but with awareness and responsibility ,I especially like the repeated reminder for water intake as we tend to forget regular intake of water even though we are aware of the necessity of consuming eight glasses of water per day ,all the extra information regarding nutrition fitness and holistic health is helpful inspiring and handy ."
12,12,1,2020-07-28T11:49:46.000Z,navneet.jadhav,It’s a marketing gimmick,I want on this app by looking at the pictures they post in their add and purchased their premium membership. It was just waste of my time and money. Leave of reducing any weight I gained more than 3 kgs in about 3 weeks...
13,13,1,2021-01-04T08:42:51.000Z,YatinGodha,Cheater,"I was using the free app. One sales executive continuously kept calling me until the time I got enrolled for a 3 months Premium membership in which it was told I will get unlimited access to 2 coaches (one fitness and one diet coach). However, it was vice-versa of that... actually, I was supposed to seek their appointment based on slot available in their schedule. Mostly they were all booked. Later after lot of request I got my coaches changed to those who are comparatively free. I lost my one month in this process. Later, the diet coach shared one diet plan (with maximum 3-4 different dishes in all meals). Just one diet plan continued till the end of the plan. {I paid more than 5000/- for a chart of 1&half page dishes) :("
14,14,4,2020-09-06T17:32:27.000Z,Dr Deepika Surendar,Great App..! But need little improvs..!,"Hi. Having big database for different foods and their caloric values are really challenging and u guys are doing a great job. However, there can be certain improvements.."

16,16,3,2021-06-12T12:12:48.000Z,Dictator11,Good app but too many subscription pop ups,The app UI and features are well built. Food library is also very vast and includes most of the indian foods and searching them is very easy and information is very accurate.
17,17,3,2019-11-25T15:28:36.000Z,sukanyasoundar,Disappointed,"Was initially impressed by the app’s content and the novel idea of coaching a person at their comfort of home. Signed up for premium plan after some research. Everything went on well till I showed dissatisfaction towards the assigned dietician. Not to blame, but the dietician could not understand my background and asked me to ignore the concerns I raised. The diet plan was never customised to suit my needs and even after repeated requests, the sales person did not even lend an ear to the complaints raised. I did not hear from him again."
18,18,1,2019-08-07T13:44:15.000Z,Space.flash,Cheap marketing strategy,"Good app to count calories but there is a catch,"
19,19,1,2019-08-28T19:23:24.000Z,ImSidart,Bugs,"I have been using it since over a year. But from past few days, it keeps changing target calorie, water in take etc. So I had lost like 6.4Kgs in 108 days and my target was 72 Kgs. And today it deleted all my data, asked me to set target again. Showed that I am obese and my Ideal weight is 58.8 Kgs. Before that it was 72 Kgs. I am 5’8”. Should I just vanish in air. Calorie target increased to 2600, before it was 1650, then 1800, then 1950. I am really confused. I had also talked with Customer care. My Premium worked for like 15-20 days, then vanished. Kept asking me to set my meal plans, then asked me to buy premium and when I tried that, it says you have already purchased this. I admit that this app has helped me a lot in keeping track of calorie and workouts etc, but these things keep messing up my mind. I have uninstalled it."
20,20,4,2018-03-23T06:57:55.000Z,Parryk83,Excellent app for Indians especially,"This is an excellent calorie tracking  app, especially for Indians, with its comprehensive database of Indian foods."
21,21,5,2018-09-14T05:02:59.000Z,iPhone_Guru_2018,Best health app ever used,I have dabbled with quite a few calorie counter apps for quite some time. I have tried the so called most popular ones in Appstore but nothing beats this Period. The USP of this app is its extensive database it has got every variety of local food you usually eat along with nutritional info. Hats off thats an achievement in itself. Not to mention the integrators and the coach plans. The integrators integrate with default health app of iOS and tells you the calories you run/walk. Big kudos to the dev team keep it this way don’t change anything..!!!
22,22,5,2018-09-19T01:39:10.000Z,RoyAnkita623,Wonderful journey past a year,"I have been connected to Healthifyme since almost a year. Initially, 1st 2 months were hard for me to follow their routine of exercise and diet. But, eventually I was able to see a slow but steady transformation from 72 kg to below. What I learnt was we need to have patience coz instant is never good. Healthifyme gave me that confident, through their regular check on me. Ananya is one of the dietician who had always kept a check on me, why I have not been able to post my details in app. Now my weight varies from 62 - 63 kgs. I would say, try Healthifyme for a healthy you 😊"

24,24,5,2019-09-05T15:39:10.000Z,Meetalish,BEST APP EVER!,"This has come to my like something god sent. I absolutely am in love with this app. Not only does it tell you your target consumption for the day and bifurcated into different meals. Once you punch in the food it tells you the calorie, fat, carbs, protein and fibre count/breakdown of each item consumed. So you can adjust your intakes throughout the day. I am not at all a foodie and because I’m a yoga teacher I would eat less and spend more energy. I have been wanting to gain weight and this app is immensely helpful. And not only to gain weight but the understanding of food and healthy living. AMAZINNG AMAZINNG AMAZING!"
25,25,1,2020-12-02T16:00:00.000Z,Ta Ag 10,One of the worst App and Services,"Unfortunately after a lot of follow up with the team, I am writing this review."
26,26,3,2020-06-03T04:59:31.000Z,Pumpy yumpy yumpkin,It’s relatively good. I have a few suggestions.,The app is good (better than all others) in the way that it includes many Indian dishes and foods in its tracker. I truly do appreciate that.
27,27,5,2021-05-17T02:25:51.000Z,PrashanthGupta,HealthifyMe is amazing app,"Started using it now I can’t leave without using it. It’s that simple. All you have to do is “start”. The cool feature is plethora of Indian cuisine and their statistical information. After you start using HealthifyMe you’ll never look the way or eat the regular food old ways. Choice of food will change for better, balanced diet improves and will encourage you to be within daily calorie diet. Most importantly it tracks your calories burnt by tracking activities is like “cherry on top”.  Why wait. Download now."
28,28,5,2020-12-10T08:52:04.000Z,liwe128,Lost 20 kgs in 5 months,"I had history of back pain (herniated disc) which has limited the daily activities and also heavy workout was a strict no to me. The diet coach (AKANKSHA MAM) & fitness coach (VAISHALI MAM) were exceptionally well, they councelled me first and also made me believe that i can loose weight with controlled diet and specially designed exercises. The diet chart and tips shared by AKANKSHA mam were so much effective and exercises from VAISHALI mam helped me to strengthen my lower back. I actually reached 78kg from 98kgs in 5 months."
29,29,5,2019-11-13T11:56:02.000Z,RohanPendyala,Much better than my expectations,I signed up for this app and paid for smart plan and I talked to a consultant who clearly explained everything in detail for me to lose weight. She pointed out the things I missed to add my diet and recommended me best foods to add to my diet plan. The consultant was very polite. To use this app first hit the gym and workout for 3-4 days and then consult all your doubts via this app and track your calorie intake. The calories you burn out is dependent upon your workout regime. Don’t blame this app for your failures. No pain-No gain.
30,30,4,2018-06-14T03:06:31.000Z,vikyviks.vs,Recent update is not good,"Your app basically solved a very good purpose of tracking our daily eating habbits and the calorie intake as well as it suggesting the right amount of calorie intake wether to put on weight or lose it and it was really helpfull because ""it helped keep track over a long period  of time, we could go back to a previous date "" but after your recent update, one cannot go back to a previous date to modify any dietary change or to look back at any particular meal of the previous so many days."
31,31,3,2018-08-21T14:12:49.000Z,prabhuan1,Ok ok,App is good. It has good database and helps in capturing the data that we would need.
32,32,3,2018-09-24T02:01:50.000Z,Ayurom,Quite a few things missing,"The app is good in terms of food database and overall functionality. However, it missies a lot of important functions like:"
33,33,5,2019-01-18T02:54:55.000Z,Meet'$,“HealthifyMe” the best weight management app,"I don’t want to talk about it features because it doesn’t need any promotion. Features are designed perfectly so that one can reduce weight by own. Hence, HealthifyMe= no gym, no regular visits to random physicians. You’ll get results in 15days because i got mine with -1 kg even without purchasing plan but this number can be multiplied by 4 with premium plans."
34,34,5,2019-07-25T15:48:19.000Z,pankswa,HealthifyMe really rocks👍🏻,"One of the best application to loose weight and stay fit no need to buy any other instrument to track your steps,calories burn etc. moreover one can get notification what is lacking behind in daily intake and what is the best food to eat to cover that. I have lost 7.5 kg in two months after following the calories intake guided by HealthifyMe. Regular water reminders put another star 🌟 in the application two thumbs up for HealthifyMe if I can lose weight so can you...... go go for it👍🏻"
35,35,5,2021-05-20T12:06:24.000Z,Ankitasri96,"Value for Money, sophisticated and easy to use","This is probably the best in the field. Their expert professionals are able to help in terms of diet, workouts (prescribed and the ones in studio), mental health, etc. The calorie tracker tracks macros and micronutrients, it works in tandem with built in phone apps for health. And the trainers are always working towards individual goals for the users. The weight loss/strength training is gradual, healthy and aims at lifestyle change. Their methods are not hearsay and are properly researched and executed by trained professionals."
36,36,5,2020-11-07T01:46:05.000Z,ajgowtam,Great for tracking Indian food,Most of the Indian food items are covered and that  is simply awesome.
37,37,3,2021-07-25T03:23:31.000Z,Divitttt,A rant,"Man it’s really annoying how many times the app tries to sell the paid version, I don’t want to pay for this I will never pay for this kind of a service so please stop making your app a pushy salesman for the premium version and make a premium version which actually adds value and sells on it’s merit rather than relying on cheap tactics like fake discounts. We all know that those discounts aren’t real, you aren’t gonna get anywhere with that. Make something valuable and people will pay. Sorry about the rude language, hope my feedback helps you guys!"
38,38,1,2021-02-03T11:51:53.000Z,firjdbfdjejrb,Not for me!,"The app is extremely focused on only the aspects of weight loss. Just counting calories isn’t enough, I wanted an app that would calculate my daily nutrient intake. It fails at that. No matter how much good stuff I ate, it would still calculate my calorie intake as extremely high, and then I would start getting phone calls from their team on how I can pay for a diet plan and reduce weight so they can make money. I think it’s ridiculous to play with people and their self esteem especially since I am of a lean built. Immediately uninstalled for promoting toxicity! If they consider adding a feature of daily nutrient intake and prepared an analysis for that, it would be so much more useful! Wasted opportunity"
39,39,2,2020-03-24T07:54:23.000Z,Aniran,Irritated,"Quite irritated with the app. It’s fine for a calorie counter. As soon as I signed up for the Smart Plan, I was hounded by daily calls from their end suggesting that I should book a phone appointment with a nutritionist. This nutritionist asked me a few questions and immediately jumped to how I should upgrade my plan by paying an extra Rs. 4.5 thousand. Instead of helping me with what I can avail with the current plan, she just tried to peddle the more expensive plan. If my experience is anything to go by, not recommended. They seem to have great experts, but I can’t seem to avail the benefit of anything except for sales calls."
40,40,5,2018-08-09T14:04:02.000Z,PSSekhon,Wonderful App .....:.:. One of the best,I have been using this app for almost 2 months now and it has immensely helped me to control my calories intake. Though I have long way to go till I reach my target of sub 70 KG weight.
41,41,4,2018-09-26T05:18:05.000Z,Jujku,Good app,"If you want to lose weight and cut down your calories then this is the best app to track your everyday calorie intake as well as your breakdown of fats, protein, carbs, fibres. It also connects with the fitness trackers and gets all the information required. I would recommend to choose this app as they have all the Indian meals along with the portion size."
42,42,5,2018-12-28T19:50:17.000Z,ArchitJain,Great app for food logging but no Apple Watch support,One of the best apps to track your food (Indian). They have in-house nutritionists and have recently launched a new section where you can buy healthy food from the app itself.
43,43,3,2019-07-19T03:04:54.000Z,prateikb,Indian food? Oh yeah!,Best part of the app is the food database. They have almost anything you search.
44,44,5,2021-04-19T09:02:03.000Z,asifaazmat,I am loving it!,I have tried a lot of apps in past but this seems to be doing the best job ever. The voice assistant Ria tracks your meals everyday and sends a report and highlights on where you were right and what needs to be changed. Also it is very easy to track calories of indian food which i really liked. It’s been 3 days but i am already enjoying using this and this is helping me track my food to help in weight loss.
45,45,5,2020-06-16T04:06:45.000Z,Chirag Rana,Quintessential Health based application.,"The app is fantastic, no doubt about it. But recently, I have observed that the application has begun to lag a lot, while searching for food data, while clicking on the various options, such as the add food, add water intake etc, the app lags and well crashes in the end. The development team should take note on this and begin working on it ASAP. This app has been life changing for me. Kindly look into the issue."
46,46,5,2020-03-08T03:55:17.000Z,YeshwantRao,YR using HealthifyMe,1. When we try to measure the calories for some combination food item it does not show. There could be a facility to add such combinations food items.
47,47,5,2020-10-11T16:08:32.000Z,Ankita90,The paid coach plans are not worth,I tried healthify free tracker and recommended the coach plan to one of my friend. This was my biggest mistake.
48,48,2,2021-06-28T17:33:17.000Z,Krushidhar Lekkala,Clumsy interface,"The app landing page seems to have too many items shouting for attention. I installed the app to use the food tracking feature, but I could not figure it out the first few times. Then when am adding food for dinner, the items not in the frequent list do not show as being selected clearly even after I select them. And then the app tries to take me to some subscription plan even before I add my first meal to track. Going by the ratings and what I heard they seem to be doing something right, but the first impressions of the interface definitely were not great."
49,49,1,2019-07-23T15:45:45.000Z,junab60,Technically Unsound App with extremely slow response time to issues,I got carried away with the rating of this app and became a paid subscriber. The rating and comments were misleading. The app did not function properly for at least three weeks because of a technical glitch. Multiple interactions with the response team confirmed to me that their technical support team is inept. The only thing I got was a good flavour of the sweet call centre type responses without much substance in the proposed solution.
50,50,4,2018-07-08T10:59:27.000Z,himank123,I love it ! But latest update is not saving time,"I love this aap. Indian food catalog is remarkable. However latest update is tome consuming. Before we write the half of the name ,  the full name of the dish will automatically appear, just tap in and boom it’s added. But now you put the small font due to which full name doesn’t appear, tapping on if  I need to see calories I can’t I again have to tap on “more” to know that. It’s consuming, I would love to roll back on previous version."

To be detail iam a doctor in NTR University is measured the food nutritional values in my college laboratory my professor also measured individually but the results are too different the app shows different measures . To be understanding u measure 1gm of carbohydrates and protein give 4 calories but 1gm fat gives 9 calories . When I select egg dosa which contains carbs , proteins, fats, triglycerides, and ....... It shows 1gm is 1.5 calories . Finally if you want accurate measures how much nutritions taking think of it .."
52,52,5,2019-12-24T06:12:50.000Z,PSJai,My conscious keeper...awesome,An excellently conceived App. Full of usual tips and directional features. I’m in awe with the whole team.

Dietitian who called me from this app was asking me to pay 12k for 6 months after discounts!  My cousin used this app paid 6k for her diet plans .. they suggest everything over phone u cannot visit them Becz they r from different cities ! When we don’t loose weight they put blame on us that we didn’t exercise or ain’t followed any diet plan! Disappointed"
54,54,1,2019-09-15T10:24:51.000Z,yashasvita,We’Re here to Mint Money Out of your Misery,Once you take the standard plan they call you into coaxing you to upgrade to premium plan. And if you don’t do it .... well it’s another useless piece of Application.
55,55,1,2019-12-26T07:34:57.000Z,42raks,Not refunding the money. Dont Buy Premium plan.,I chose 6 months membership plan from HealthifyMe in 1259. The diet plan which I got wasn’t as expected for weight loss. I have initiated the chat to change the plan for one month. Ankita the representative she change the plan and after the changes when I asked for refund rest amount she called me nd said that I have paid 999 for 6 months and one month plan is of 799. When I explained her and showed the screenshot that i paid 1259 and one month plan is of 499 she hung up the call saying that she will check and get back. But she blocked me from chat support and there is no contact number to call customer support. Fake Service!!

57,57,3,2021-01-01T05:36:52.000Z,Darbiebar,Prices keep changing,The app keeps changing their prices of the plans and the names of the plans as well absolutely ridiculous . So if you take a plan for a certain amount in one month you will see the price of the plan has increased there is no consistency at all they keep editing the prices of the plans when and when they feel. which makes it very annoying to subscribe to the paid options and then continue that. For the free option it is an okay tracker.
58,58,2,2020-03-29T08:17:54.000Z,Samriddha1993ganguly02,Pathetic Support Staff,"While the app is beautiful and very useful, the tech support is useless. For every small thing, they ask for a 24 hr time to address it which would have been fine if they actually did. But when asked after 36 hrs even, not only is the problem not addressed but also they take no effort to try and fix the problem for the customers."

60,60,5,2017-12-22T04:03:42.000Z,Ra.vee kumar,Great App👍🏻,"I've been using this app for the past two years and am extremely happy with the features inherent to it. I'm able to effectively keep track of my calories and workouts simultaneously without any hassles. Moreover, the expert advice received from the coaches is very useful and informative. Being a fitness freak, I find this app very useful and user friendly. Keep up the good work"

I have been using this regularly for several months now and it has helped me keep track of everything I have eaten in a given day. That makes it very helpful.
62,62,5,2019-04-25T13:56:56.000Z,Blues and woes,Transformation,"HealthifyMe is the best ever thing that happened to me. I get to log in my food so that I understand the importance of both quality and quality of food that I intake. This accuracy is achieved by my fitness Coach Imtiaz and diet coach Ruchi, both of whom are absolutely dedicated. The follow up sessions with them are absolutely helpful in keeping me on track. They make sure that I get the best. I’d recommend this to the highest extent."
63,63,5,2021-06-26T14:21:13.000Z,veds98,Simple and informative,"This is by far the most useful health tool that anyone can use to improve their diet and manage weight better. The tracker here is the best feature - which has the nutritional information of all Indian foods. I’ve been using this app for about one month, and I have lost more than 8 kgs of weight, simply by tracking my diet as per the app’s guidance. Kudos to the developers!"
64,64,1,2020-06-17T15:00:27.000Z,Prithviraj88,Very poor customer service,My wife purchased a smart plan and added a paid buddy plan. The buddy plan didn’t activate on my phone. Tried getting it resolved from them for 4 days but they keep turning it to the backend team who never get in touch with you. Every time you call them they come up with a new way to delay the resolution. I gave the support team everything they needed but apparently their system does not allow it. Total waste of money and time. Why put offers if you can’t offer them real time. Really makes me wonder if these guys have paid for the ratings on the App Store and play store.
65,65,5,2019-12-17T15:35:39.000Z,Avinash65,Your best friend and guide to good health,"At first I was sceptical, whether it would help (I was looking for weight loss). But my daughter persuaded me to use it and since then I  am using the App for almost a year, and now this has become a habit. In the process, I have lost around 9 Kgs of weight. I have become more conscientious in choice of food. The App overall has motivated me to choose a healthy lifestyle. Thanks to HealthifyMe team."
66,66,3,2019-12-08T16:32:08.000Z,nik-h,Features improvement,"Could not find feature of logging in time of meals. Time interval between meals is an importanct factor in becoming fitter. Also for few servings not all measurements are added. How can we plan a meal with available ingredients? Tweaks are required depending on factors like seasonal, economical availability of food etc. Few improvements required in the app to be more insighful. If these features are available, please tell how to explore. Have used the app for only a day. Let’s see how it fares in long run."
67,67,5,2021-03-14T13:01:55.000Z,Ambighali,A useful Healthy App,"Helps you Keep a track of everything that goes in your body thus helping you being mindful of how many calories you put inside your body. Not just that it also provides analysis of breakup like proteins, carbs etc. Surprisingly it has almost all the dishes in its database no matter which part of the state you belong to. Highly recommend it."
68,68,5,2020-04-15T16:22:19.000Z,Bharat vasdev,Good app,"But for activity tracker, it should automatically update the calories burnt when we are completing the app recommend workout. Example after completing complex cardio, 460 calories Burnt should be directly updated in calories tracker. If person is completing the partial workout then calorie should be updated for completed activities only."

The macro count of your protein fat carb Fiber is amazing and quick . Easy to track each meal and very easy and quick to fill data . Also used their premium service with coaches from time to time . Have lost substantial weight thanks to this app .
70,70,3,2018-05-26T16:50:28.000Z,Hk140,Great app with huge potential to improve,"The app has as huge variety of foods and especially Indian foods. But when you compare it with the best of the best such as MFP, it fails. Firstly because the database on healthify is wrong. It’s not horse science that each gram of carbs has 4 cals, protein has 4 cals and fats have 9 cals. When you calculate it’s absolutely wrong. I’ve been a fitness and nutrition enthusiast for the past 10 years and it was easy to spot. It’d be great if they can actually verify."

But in-spite of indicating that I am diabetic in profile section and food preferences multiple times, it keeps on recommending Rice-Only meals and Sugary items! Their customer support is as idiotic as their AI and is a confused lot as they promise the refund but then ask us to contact Apple for refund of Money which gets declined by Apple without proper reason."

Once you start being honest with yourself and enter the food you eat, this app will help you understand how intake has to be managed."
74,74,4,2021-07-01T13:57:57.000Z,ArfathShaikh,Very Helpful,HealthifyMe application is very helpful for your weightloss journey. Diet plan is spot on keeping in mind the macro and micronutrients. The diet coach makes sure you be on track with regular calls and checks. Fatima Adam has been very kind and helpful as my diet coach. Workout plan is also good but it gets a little repetitive over the course of a month. If a doctor on call could be included in the package it would really help in case of injuries.
75,75,4,2021-05-08T03:31:58.000Z,2kjn,Outdoor exercise,"Everything is perfect. But need lot of improvement in the app on outdoor exercises. While on walk, its next to impossible to keep the screen up all the time showing the second and time left. I tried even to keep the phone screen up with keeping in my hand. But it didnt work out. It should also keep running in the background or screen lock mode."

Disappointing!!,"I paid for the smart plan which they promote a lot and on my first call with the dietitian, she said that the plan is useless and wished me luck if I achieve my target. Very demotivating and kept pushing to purchase higher plans by paying extra. Highly unprofessional and I suggest HealthifyMe to not promote a plan in your advertisements when your staff has to call it useless as they just want to make cookie points with the employer by pushing people to pay more. Not interested in such ideas. Wish I could get the refund on my plan as well. Highly disappointed!!"
78,78,5,2020-02-23T16:47:01.000Z,tushark29,Beat app for weight loss,"This is by far the best app if you are tracking your calories to stay fit. Just one improvement is needed, there are many who have got result just by using calories tracking. They should be able to post their weight loss stories rather than only those who have purchased diet plans."

Individually you have to type each exercise while tracking it. Means why you guys are giving so much pain to the customers when there can be a simple option to track all activities there in the list itself. Such a big glitch it is!!"
89,89,5,2019-12-08T07:11:02.000Z,sanjeev34,Good app to monitor your self if done diligently,It is good app to monitor your self but one need to be ensuring that correct details are recorded. The features are very good and for normal person life it give all the data as you need to monitor your calories and keep a good balance. More important the data base is quite vast which can capture almost all foods in Indian scenario.

Recently I wanted to make a comparison , so I logged in simultaneously with my fitness pal app also. To my surprise there was a 200 calorie difference in my breakfast alone ! After logging in the entire day’s food I found that HealthifyMe showed 1600 kcal whereas my fitnesspal had 2100 kcal ! Would recommend my fitness pal over this app always."

It’s also very user friendly with great features to track food intake (calories) and burnout. Even for healthier and diet conscious people it does helps to have a check with easy tracking. Free tips, motivation stories, points are good add-ons. Keep going."

And it'd be nice to have the data in the app be synced to the health app on iphones. Plus going back to the previous days can be tedious because the ""today"" button doesn't always work reliably, at least on my iphone x. I usually have to resort to going to more > diary"

One thing i am not able to tract is my proper step counts as my Mi band cannot be synced with it. Otherwise this app is really helpful. Have already recommended this app to my friends."
103,103,1,2019-03-17T04:23:38.000Z,Anuradha Gupta,Undue deduction of money,This app is not at all user friendly the app does not show the cancel subscription option in the app. The money gets debited on it’s own and does not give any reminders or takes any confirmations. The money is taken and the app does not have any help or question bar. The refund option is not visible when the app is not even being used. The contact information is also not available easily and i do not know how to reach to the query zone. The results of the app are also not very impressive.
104,104,5,2019-04-18T05:34:16.000Z,A. Sravani,Very good experience,"It is a very good experience to be a part of HealthifyMe.... I learnt many tips regarding the diet and fitness/yoga after joining this app. It changed my perception towards the word ‘dieting’.... now I understood that dieting is not dragging yourself to hunger, instead it is a habit of eating healthy in right quantities and at right time... thanks to HealthifyMe for changing my lifestyle."
105,105,5,2019-05-21T15:36:12.000Z,Deboshree Mohanta,Best Best Best!!!,"I am saying from my personal experience, this is one of the best apps out there. My coaches guide me and inspire each day to do better. Losing weight is not easy, it doesn’t happen over night. But it’s a journey of one’s own to a better lifestyle. I am overjoyed to be a part of this journey. It challenges me everyday."
106,106,5,2019-09-16T09:27:28.000Z,AbhiGusain,Quite efficient,It helped me to keep a track of my macros while I was in a weight loss program. You can’t be precise about your daily intake but this app will give you an approx information. Keeping a track of your meal becomes crucial once you reach to your desire shape and wanna maintain it. So its an all weather app.

Very nice & qualified coaches who track you whole day so that result will come at any cost. Give you nice options of food according to your status. I've lost 2kgs in just 1week, I'm impressed a lot & feeling motivated to achieve my goal ahead"

It would be really good if you could add sync of intake calorie data with the health app. This will be greatly beneficial for me as I can check everything at one place.

I mean, that’s so undemocratic, adding a unique feature shouldn’t mean you don’t let us speak for ourselves. It would have been better to add health related articles instead."
111,111,5,2018-10-23T15:21:39.000Z,PriyankaRamanan,Will definitely recommend others!,HealthifyMe has good coaches and nutritionalists who actually stick to more natural things than any other medicines compared to other weight reduction programs. I will highly recommend my friends and family for a healthy life.
112,112,3,2018-11-12T15:42:59.000Z,Elena447,Calorie mistakes.,It is perfect for people on indian diet as it has virtually all indian dishes in it’s database but it has a lot of calorie mistakes. It tends to underestimate proteins in dishes and overestimate fat and when you match it with Google it turns out wrong so that’s quite a bummer as how would I know if my diet is adequate or not?. Sometimes the live exercise option shuts down or does not reflect in the workout log. Otherwise the app is pretty good.

Dr Vaishally has also planned my diet by considering all aspects related to me. I wont say my progress in terms of health is very fast but i am noticing positive changes in my lifestyle. Thanks to both the coaches

Thank god I didn’t took the paid package as i highly doubt their ethics now. Dude stick to your words or shut this app. Without payment if this the kind of service then after payment they are capable of vanishing for sure. Highly disappointed 👎🏻
115,115,5,2021-03-09T07:54:32.000Z,Oman@S,Best app regarding fitness stuffs!,This is the best aap i have found for calculating calories. Almost every dish is there in there database. The UI is excellent and very easy to use.   I regularly use this app for calculating my daily calorie consumption and want to recommend this for those who are going through fat loss journey.

118,118,3,2021-07-30T06:29:41.000Z,later thk,App is good but there is lot of scope of improvement,I am using this app since 15 days finding it good but feels like trainer and dietitian can design much better plans for me. It is not up to the mark also exercise and diet plan is same for 1 month which is very boring. 1 more issue is we 3 frds have enrol for this and everyone is getting different different service no uniformity.

It helps the user to have a realistic appreciation of his/ her performance in calories consumed and spent on daily basis. It turns into an instrument of self motivation in the health mission without undesirable side effects
124,124,3,2019-07-09T16:14:53.000Z,sudip2018,Irritating app. Only targeting weight loss.,"It’s an irritating app. It thinks reducing body weight is the only goal of life!!!! After upgrading from free to paid app, it’s employees will ask you constantly to avail personal trainer. AI is just a dumb one. It can’t answer your questions."

Are you serious? When are you going to stop like on 100 cal a day? Totally unrealistic and those annoying ads to buy their plans."
127,127,5,2021-06-30T06:41:29.000Z,binduahuja,Definitely try it.,It’s definitely worth the money. This app doesn’t just help you with weight loss but also helps you with setting up a healthy lifestyle. The coaches are very interactive and they keep a tab on our day to day progresses.
128,128,4,2021-05-11T17:33:53.000Z,AJAXtheGR8,Brilliant app but few suggestions for improvement,"Hi. First of all, thanks a ton for creating a vast and sizeable database of dishes with calorie details specifically for the Indian consumer. The workout routines, yoga routines and other trackers (water, hands wash, mental health etc) are the cherry on the cake."

The best app so far for Indian suncontinent,This app really helps you track every Indian meal with accurate calories intake and also supports you with water intake with constant reminders if you opt for it. I have been using this app since 2 years and it is awesome.
132,132,3,2018-10-01T06:19:02.000Z,av1709,Consultation is a farce,"I received a total of 5 messages and 2 emails reminding me about a consultation appointment I made 48 hours back. The joke is, it is now 45min past the appointed time and I haven’t received any call. If it’s an appointment you can’t keep, the least you can do is not send irritating reminders about the upcoming consultation call. The app is okay so far. But the “coach” business is a joke."
133,133,2,2019-04-18T11:05:24.000Z,Anjali reddy,Not good services,"App wise, it’s great. It has all Indian food data base and also it helps us to calculate macros of raw and cooked food which no other app provides but hiring or paying for the coaches is worst. The company won’t even look back into your actual query and won’t serve the actually need you were there in first place. One of ten pathetic services I face. Unfortunately I’m stuck with them for next 8 months and I regret it."

147,147,4,2020-12-22T10:16:14.000Z,MamGowda,Super efficient,Probably the only app which has such variety of Indian food with names taken in different utterances. Been a regular user due to that. Only feedback is the app closes itself instead of running in the background during a run if another application opened.

Otherwise it’s a wonderful app.

If you religiously follow the diet maybe you’ll get results, that is if you have all the patience to follow it. I went for a smart plan which only gives me access to the diet chart and thr AI (which I haven’t used, or didn’t feel the need to do so) apart from that it does nothing else. I’d get better suggestion if I googled (if you know the right place to look for)."

For e.g: when I use the AI (Ria ) fir information, she mentions to follow link below or etc but the app doesn’t show anything. Secondly, when I try to chat with the Coach suddenly chat window disappears and you have no idea what are you typing or whether how to send the text. Whole “Chat Box” disappears. Kindly check that,"

At first they insisted for a 6 month plan and told that there’s no one month plan. Beware of marketers who work at HealthifyMe as they try to lure by giving instant discounts which is off no use.

209,209,5,2019-08-09T15:18:47.000Z,NarenChonira,Sync issues,The app is unable to sync the number of steps from the Health app in iOS. Tired syncing multiple times but doesn’t update the number of steps.

Combined with the insights of micronutrients is very useful.  Adding and tracking of food items is as well very intuitive and easy to handle.

215,215,5,2019-10-23T00:45:35.000Z,Prabav,My experience with the App,Excellent app on which I accidentally bumped while surfing for some useful health tips. Diligently following my food intake with an excellent guide behind me called “Healthyfyme”. I could reduce 7 kg over 6 months period. Really useful.
216,216,5,2021-06-01T22:11:45.000Z,Asu soni,"Best fitness app , but it could be better in terms of pade version",U can introduce only 1 month trail paid version ...is to ricky if we pay for 12. Months and then stop using it
217,217,5,2020-06-29T18:51:11.000Z,vjkarun,Nice interface,I have just started using this App as part of corporate healthy living program.   Impressed with their interface and the work out plan.
218,218,1,2021-05-14T08:49:23.000Z,Madhurima M,App is getting worse by the day,Once upon a time it used to be a great app. I started my fitness journey practically on this app. But with time the services worsened and now the tracking system has become a joke. When you bring that to the notice of customer service you realise it is non existent and they just promise “to get back to you “. Very disappointing to see such a promising Indian app going downhill like this

Don’t trust the fake ratings too.. if you try to rate one star in app they don’t let us to rate in playstore/appstore . If you rate 5 star they will direct to rate in playstore/appstore..."

222,222,1,2019-05-05T03:21:04.000Z,Vanshika ahuja,Not at all happy with the services,"It is just an app / company who focuses on weight loss. I dont even know how do their nutritionist perform for a weight loss program. I had taken it to cure a medical problem, however they dont know anything about it. They just copy paste the diet charts given to them. Nutritionist are half of the time not available. And they changed 4 nutritionist in a span of 4 months. I dont recommend this app to anyone."

225,225,1,2021-07-21T14:37:35.000Z,Aditi1631,Barely helpful,"The services provided by the app would be available for free over the Internet or any other app. The customer support is quick in reaching out to convince you to pay, but when you ask for a refund, they have no response. Given that they had a “Free Trial” feature, I’d have never put my money on this app. Not useful at all and also the customer support is useless."
226,226,5,2020-10-27T19:17:53.000Z,hayydar,Very helpful application,Thanks to the creators of this app ! A very big thanks for adding all Indian daily life consumed foods & beverages.

229,229,5,2019-09-25T03:02:59.000Z,M0737,Important Change,Add the feature for writing data about nutrients of food intake in Apple health app. Much needed as I use apple health to track my food and exercise. Your app is great to find recipe but add this feature

235,235,5,2019-04-04T13:50:23.000Z,Glowoflife,Great app for calorie counting,I mainly use this app for tracking the amount of calories I'm consuming. The best part is it has a huge database of Indian dishes which is impossible to find in any other app. Pretty useful

237,237,1,2021-04-12T14:52:55.000Z,Kaspa Srikanth,They don't refund on time,They don't refund on time and looting my money by charging my account even after cancellation of subscription. It's been 2 months since I have cancelled my subscription and still they didn't refund my amount and charging emi for the same.. This is not fair. Their customer care is hopeless because they reply after a day. They are really hopeless in customer care
238,238,1,2020-11-03T15:09:44.000Z,agasaurabh,App not for free usage,"I have downloaded the app and deleted after few weeks. I am Indian hence i quite like the list covering all Indian food. It was easy to find exact food. However , I fed up with continued banner while using app or notifications to buy services etc. In multiple cases , there is no way to even cancel the banner that is very aggressive marketing. It is certainly painful to have such app."

243,243,1,2019-05-23T09:32:05.000Z,Ravdeep Kour,Less than an average,When I opened this app it recommends me to buy meal plan and when I purchased it and amount for the same got deducted from my account then it was showing nothing means no plan at all and when I’m clicking on my meal plan it automatically log me out of the app. I tried this many times but same thing happened. Very disappointing. Refund my money back now.
244,244,5,2019-10-31T17:53:40.000Z,Adnanqureshi1993,Too good,Worth it!! Should join for daily activity. Helps you to lose weight and keep you active. Better than any gym. The trainers are pretty qualified within their fields.
245,245,2,2021-07-17T12:19:37.000Z,Kush Sharma,Not good if you have an Apple Watch,Their feature to sync with Apple Health is buggy. Have complained about this in past too. Their workout tracker does not show the number of active calories and total calories as it is shown in the Health app. You can track the amount of calories consumed very nicely through this app though.
246,246,2,2020-06-29T18:29:37.000Z,Boyena san,Trail version diet plan not displaying,I have downloaded the app. I given my details. I’m training to see the diet plan on trail version but the page keep on loading very disappointed. Then why are you giving trail for 7 days when I’m not able to see the diet plan. Or ur diet plan will display post construction? I don’t know about your app process
247,247,1,2020-05-31T09:30:41.000Z,...NP,Subscription,I subscribed for a 1 month trial for 799. It did not seem to work for me so I did not renew my subscription. Even then the app kept debiting the same amount for the next three months after I unsubscribed. I am lodging a complain with the bank and trying to stop this. There seems to be no customer care number in the app as well. It looks like the app is a way to steal money.
248,248,5,2021-07-03T05:40:58.000Z,Biswadip Dey,Edit option ?,Where is the edit option of food item we enter in tracker in iOS 14?

254,254,1,2020-10-21T05:56:18.000Z,hindwakansh,Sold phone number,Ever since I downloaded this app I started getting random sales calls (that too from mobile numbers- not landlines). HealthifyMe has clearly sold phone numbers to such e-marketing companies. This is such a shame. One can’t even avoid picking up these calls since they are from mobile phone numbers assuming it can be something important
255,255,1,2020-01-18T06:50:06.000Z,Deepthy759,Worst customer care service,"I couldn’t follow the diet and exercise they show in this app, so they told me they’ll refund within a week and it’s been more than 25 days I haven’t received my refund at all. No one responds properly in Healthify me.. They would respond ASAP while making payments or taking any course but vice versa in other cases.. Hate this application .. Doesn’t recommend to anyone at all.."

It worked well for some time then it started showing wrong meals for the wrong places. Like sabjis in breakfast and breakfast in lunch , and when I complained about it they told me that i am not utilising it properly or I should do it manually... the hell i paid for then?  Recommendation-4/10"

262,262,1,2018-07-29T07:39:31.000Z,SweetyS1,Worst customer care..,Worst app ever.. Never trust them.. i have trusted and made the payment without even realising that I am paying more.. within 4 hours given them a call to refund.. they are saying they will charge 750.. i have not used anything and simply lost 750 just for the sake of trusting and paying..

269,269,1,2020-09-25T08:54:48.000Z,poornasc,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed with this. The food you recommend is expensive. For the initial 2 weeks it was okay later on it became expensive food. If chose some other  food , the options are very limited. No motivation to continue with this diet. And the trainer didn't even provide my last 2 plans. Pathetic response. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
