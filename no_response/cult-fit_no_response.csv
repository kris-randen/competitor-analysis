0,0,5,2021-02-20T18:44:41.000Z,worst game ever oof,Amazing app!,"My name is Dhruv and I was a bit fat a few weeks ago but then I came across this app. I started of with the beginners sessions and finished it so that I could go for belly burn. What I found out was I had already burned a lot of calories just with the beginners package. But I did not stop there as I knew that if I had stopped, then my fat would have kept on increasing. So I went for the belly burn. The first package of the belly burn which was the beginners one started out great. The instructor explained all the steps in detail and I got the hang of by the end of the sessions. Then when I started the first session of intermediate, I realised that all the calmness the instructor had in the beginners package took a huge dip. But that was fine as I did understand everything the instructor had explained. Then when I dot to advanced, I realised that this was not easy and that the beginners training would take me up for something like that. But I was impressed as by the end of the whole belly burn package, I had lost over 5 kg.p and I was very happy. So I would easily recommend this app to anyone looking to get exercise, yoga, dance and much more. Thank you for all the support!"
1,1,5,2019-07-07T09:00:18.000Z,Sharathshashidhar,Best workout experience ever.,"I have worked out is several gyms for the last 10 years and I must say this is the best so far. In terms of everything from start to finish. If you have a busy schedule and don‚Äôt know what time you can get to gym this is the best as you can choose the time accordingly. Also, you just have to show up to class and they make sure they understand your intensity and suggest easier or tougher variation based on your endurance. The different variations is what gets you hooked. If your idea is to go regularly then try out all the classes and pick and choose what you like. It‚Äôs been 3 months and apart from Sunday‚Äôs I go every other day. The app and software part of cult is amazing, as a software engineer I can totally tell they have done an amazing job. They have the outdoors and swimming pools which are a good addition. You won‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs monotonous at all. Try the yoga classes as well. They are super good and relaxing after a great workout. Kudos to cult."
2,2,5,2019-06-08T18:32:28.000Z,JMMoni07,Worst customer support,Since my stay was for a short while in India I wrote an email asking for one month packages. After patiently waiting for 24 hours I got a reply stating there are one month packs available in the app for your location. I eagerly went and checked immediately and saw nothing but the 6 months and 3 months available. I again wrote to them stating I don‚Äôt see it. After again waiting for 1 day the reply they send me is to reinstall the app from App Store. Which I had already done and sent them a screenshot as well. The next time when I still do not see any one month packages I sent them an email and this time no body even cared to reply to my email.
3,3,5,2019-06-24T05:33:00.000Z,Suman Julka,Just brilliant !,"I am amazed to see the professionalism ingrained from entrance to the exit ... it‚Äôs just mind blowing ; the way eat , plan , fit is put together  ... all is well thought of ... never imagined there will be so minute detailing done on keeping water area too :) just great ... I attended one session and booked and have told 3 people within 12 hours .. I wish the quality is maintained and people are smiling as they are now ; being in‚Äôs hospitality it‚Äôs important to keep fit and energetic people to meet the athletes ( as you call us ) ;).... I lost trust in the good gyms because they hardly maintain quality forever ... also the intelligence is seen when you have opened so many Centers... that‚Äôs really cutting the deal as I always wanted this kind of place but either it was far off from my place or blowing me off .... :) well done ! And it‚Äôs not easy to get complements from new athletes like us ;)"
4,4,1,2019-12-27T14:43:40.000Z,Dr S Nagpal,Food is good but delivery and hygiene during delivery was pathetic. Back to back spilled curries.,"Honestly I have high respect for cult and curefit. But food delivery which is most important these days(specially after cautions deliveries by Swiggy and Zomato) was worst. Remember I am not quoting here quality of food, it‚Äôs the casual packing and henceforth spilling and then enforced delivery and then complain attended by one Mr Deep quoting that only cutlery got spoiled owing to spilling, so henceforth nothing big to cry. Spilling means loose seal and contaminated food, that itself is not acceptable. Sadly spillage spoils your complete order and no one feels like eating that kind of food. Imagine kheer with curry on top. What health man and what calories if open food is kept in a riders bag full of dust."
5,5,2,2019-07-30T22:03:06.000Z,nashcheez,"Beatuiful app, has metrics to keep you motivated","The app is very well built. Love how the home screen is pretty minimal only detailing the important info that one needs to glance at any time of the day. Has a good body vitals and step/sleep tracking in built. However, the new class booking section feels less intuitive and too crowded for my taste. I would prefer the previous UI where the class booking buttons were more vibrant and easy to read. The current white background smaller buttons don‚Äôt have that impact. Hence, deducting a star from the rating."
6,6,5,2020-09-19T13:30:48.000Z,Amrapalli K,CureFit is an absolute fire!!,"I have been very whimsical about workouts. Even though I hail from a family with sports background but then too I am not someone who would dedicatedly continue the workouts. CureFit has help me achieve what I have been trying to achieve since a very long time..Motivation. With the variety of workouts, yoga, kickboxing etc. that they have in service is something you do not come across everywhere. The intensity of the exercises and the duration is perfect. The availability of classes at the tip of your fingers in Live classes, is something which is praiseworthy."
7,7,1,2019-04-17T14:34:47.000Z,kushank bhanot,Worst customer service,"I opened with Cult post my phone broke down last week at cult outdoor 54 gurgaon.  I went to my locker(which dont have option to lock) and opened it, it just fell right away and the surface below is so rocky and uneven that the entire screen got shattered and my phone just isn‚Äôt working!"
8,8,5,2020-04-13T15:13:34.000Z,aasthi ‚ù§Ô∏è,Improvement in workout because of Cultfit ‚ù§Ô∏è,Loving it.. I have improved a lot. I have to  built my energy more. I have to  improve more day by day. I have to get better. Thankyou so much cultfit for live classes. It‚Äôs been almost a year I have started seeing lot of changes in myself because of workout.. hoping to improve more soon.. To increase my stamina to give my 200 percent. Hoping to achieve soon. Looking forward to open cultfit soon.. so that I can try more workouts which I use to think I will not able to do.. the best part that live classes got me a realization I can do any type of üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Thankyou so much for amazing family of cult.. To all the members specially to the trainers and the managers. Really proud to be part of Cult family. üòÉüòçü§©
9,9,1,2018-03-21T20:35:28.000Z,Vm0023,Flawed pricing policy,I took 2 trial sessions at cult. I very much enjoyed the class and was motivated to buy their package at the offer price of 9999 for 4months. Which now is 9950 for 2 months. The terms and conditions clearly mention they can take back there offers at any given point in time. The problem is the price manipulation and the frequency they do it at. Company only gives a small window for discounts on smaller duration packages and promotes purchasing a higher package and this is where i got disappointed with cult. From being so advanced with their programs and plans they decided to go with same old business model which every gym follows luring in customers who are first time fitness enthusiasts and recover revenue for a year. Eventually adding zero value to the final customer. They enabled an option to book a session at 450 at the centre? Who wants to pay that much for a session with 10 people? Unable to see the value add though i was a customer at first but highly dissatisfied and disappointed.
10,10,5,2018-10-31T01:27:21.000Z,Xpert.,It brings discipline in life,I dont agree with review done by miss damani. I believe. Its good to be disciplined in life. And being on time is first thing. I am not at all a gym person. Too lazy for Work outs and walks. But i joined cult three months back as a trial and i am addicted to it already.  My initial mission was to loose weight but now its just pure happiness. I feel happy through out the day when i spend an hour in the morning working out at cult. Trust me there r no tantrics doing jadu tona to hypnotize u there. They r just hard working trainers who spend their entire day to give u sessions at ur chosen time. I already extended my membership and love working out there. Have a lot to say but will conclude
11,11,5,2019-01-12T15:30:17.000Z,Neo345678,Consistency,"First of all, concept is too cool, a revolutionary program for indian fitness. Abt Branding ,absolutely thrilled. Working out since 1 year. No concerns hassles from staff or amenities or customer care. Trainers push u and motivate in a group in every class..(so much monotonous for them, but tats d beauty of cult service culture )."
12,12,1,2019-03-27T18:58:19.000Z,Deepak763,Cheap business strategy,The classes are good and the offers as well. Most the time they will have 40-50% discount so nothing so get super excited about offer. The pain starts after getting the subscription. They say unlimited classes but u should feel very lucky if u get a single class in your preferred timings(obviously not 2pm in the afternoon ) and location. I get the feeling of IRCTC ticket booking.
13,13,4,2019-04-08T02:44:46.000Z,AtomicAve001,Excellent experience (few suggestions),"I had an excellent experience using the App. The integration across different areas (Cult, Eat, Cure) is well executed. For example the meals, tests, workout plan are all listed together helping it plan our day. I love how the calories for the food that I order gets logged automatically. Appreciate the sessions available on app for some extra home exercise. Overall I think this is a good app."
14,14,5,2019-05-21T06:48:49.000Z,meetshray,Frustrating App,I have tried multiple times to place food order but there is some basic UX issues which don‚Äôt allow me to place the order and frustrate me.
15,15,5,2019-05-24T06:05:17.000Z,Jain_meg,"If you are not a Gym person, Join Cult!",It takes hell lot of effort to go to any gym and run on treadmill and do similar exercises. It‚Äôs boring and not motivating at all.
16,16,2,2020-08-11T04:07:19.000Z,Sean987656,Frequent bugs,"Overall a great app with good features, but there are many of these features that are frequently moving or conflicting ... for eg on PT sessions , we need to know the sessions to be prepped but the session details keeping coming and going every week. You have to toggle multiple screens to gather info. As a feedback, it will be best to keep a single window for all details on a particular workout and an overall dashboard for everything else ... there is also no place to give this feedback on the app. I have been using the app for more than 20 weeks now so this constant bothering has slightly becoming annoying now hence giving a low rating so that someone can take a note and fix .... again, overall much ahead of many other similar apps in terms of bundle of features available just needs to be but more efficient"
17,17,5,2019-10-14T07:28:47.000Z,Cherrieecookiee,Best Application Ever!,"I‚Äôve seen many applications related to workout,meditation and yoga. But this is completely different. Care,Cult,eat,mind...OMG! This‚Äôs really a multi useful app. Before installing this app I used to be very sleepy,exhausted,lazy but after, my schedule is totally changed. I decided to start workout at home though there‚Äôs no cult center in my place. First I started session for beginners. I was quite excited to do them by seeing the videos. Those videos are absolutely fantastic...the way you elucidate and timing perfection and encouragement brings up a new interest. During my beginning stage, I felt some pain and soreness in my muscles...but I didn‚Äôt give up since NO PAIN NO GAIN!"

20,20,3,2018-03-10T12:17:41.000Z,RibhuChawla,"Please add calander support, custom reminders and widget",Everything works well but definitely has possibilities of improvement. Few features I'd love -
21,21,1,2019-01-18T02:49:27.000Z,Kiralya47,"Disappointed now, was impressed in the beginning","1. Eat fit guys delivered meals very late. They don‚Äôt give an option to call the delivery guy, so you never know when they arrive until they call you. Tracking is crap."
22,22,5,2020-06-06T14:38:54.000Z,Pavn 06,Awesome workout both for body and mind. But app crashing repeatedly,Hi. First of all let me applaud the cultfit team for their excellent service as always during these difficult and demanding times. I must say that it‚Äôs an anchor to sail through these demanding times by keeping out body and mind fit and healthy.
23,23,4,2020-03-31T11:44:04.000Z,Annie4298,Good content but could improve streaming,"I‚Äôm a cult member and a fan of Cult. However during these times of lockdown when one looks forward to accessing your workout videos, I am never satisfactorily able to view the content on the app even though I have a good internet connection. Firstly, getting to open a workout video seems to be a insurmountable task, and even if you achieve that, it just keeps getting stuck every 10 minutes. Umm..no.. every 5 minutes. It would be really amazing if you could look into this and make watching workout videos a seamless experience. Thanks!!"
24,24,1,2019-10-13T17:51:47.000Z,Richard Simon Albert,Great content! Poor app,"All though the information inside the app is really great which I could give a five star. But, the app is quite buggy even after using it for about 4 months and they don't bother to fix the download part of the training."
25,25,5,2020-02-08T14:34:19.000Z,Rupy Paul,Kindly decrease plastic or other disposable material usage for packing,Ask your customers to give different ideas for that.
26,26,5,2020-06-05T06:23:17.000Z,aaanviiu,cure fit recommendation,"It really is helping losing out some calories, it is not at all expensive and the instructions are great! Moreover they have yoga sessions and online live sessions. I really recommend this app to everyone those who want to be all fit and healthy in this quarantine. This app also keeps a track about the calorie burn and weight loss."
27,27,5,2021-06-18T03:15:45.000Z,Sharathlinx,So much content and so many less taps to reach them,"Hi, being a cult member since a long time. I am also a mobile application QA for IOS Apps in IBM. I am really amazed by the way this app really works. It must be definitely a tremendous team work from UX,Development and OM team to being such an art of an App to customer. I have never seen this App crash and it gives me abosulte pleasure to just sit and navigate to see so many content being organised in such a beautiful way on a WKWebview page. Kudos to team. Rating this 5star."
28,28,1,2021-01-19T05:05:26.000Z,Leeladhar Giri,Apathetic response from customer support,"For every small issue, we can‚Äôt invest so much time going back and forth in emails(as they don‚Äôt have the call option). They don‚Äôt recognise the issue, they don‚Äôt accept it. This kind of behaviour is really frustrating and leaves you in stress."
29,29,5,2020-04-16T11:50:37.000Z,Amanth,The Cult,"I joined cult in November 2019 for the variety of workout that was available. I enjoyed the format of workout to choose from, the professionalism displayed by each athlete during the sessions, and the 50 min workout regime that‚Äôs designed to perfection. Things went on as usual and then comes the lockdown due to covid-19, cult takes the country by surprise by releasing a live session workout, and it‚Äôs open to non-members too. To me Cult is a classic example of how a start-up should operate, it‚Äôs a management case study for sure..!"

It is very helpful for us like homemakers. It would be also great if trainers suggest a person with a certain health issue can do a particular exercise or not."
33,33,5,2020-05-07T23:18:36.000Z,vkaushik001,Health,"It‚Äôs the best health platform ever created by anyone . It has everything eveneyone May want. Various kind of exercises for all categories of needs by variety of people at all times , various mental mediations , talks , connect with doctors and nutrionists and chef with recipients . And so much more . Meditations Tailored to normal mass, kids and even Hindi speaking people. If I was sitting and planning, couldn‚Äôt have thought more . This is amazing. If it was possible to put 10 stars I would not hesitate."
34,34,5,2020-04-27T12:33:01.000Z,MihirKavi,The app version for iPad is not proper,1. The auto rotate does not work for iPad. It rotates to a an opposite angle on iPad always.
35,35,5,2020-11-01T13:13:01.000Z,Adarsh Khamitkar,Worst online Dance Fitness classes ever!,"Seriously guys this is my third bad review in a row about dance fitness classes on both class review and app review. What is wrong with you guys, dance fitness used to be great, these days they are absolutely worst. You guys are literally destroying the original energy of the songs with your absolutely worst moves which doesn‚Äôt affect the body at all. Please improve your dance moves and select energetic songs with right moves. No stars for online dance fitness classes. Absolutely worst!"
36,36,5,2020-12-14T15:45:43.000Z,anshulchhabra,excellent superb,I would not say that this is one of the best gym in town I would say this is the only gym which offer everything brands like gold gym and anytime there trainer are only crazy for personal training they not even look at you but in cult they care about your each and every posture they guide you from start to end everything is so smooth that you enjoy each and every minute of the workout.

38,38,5,2020-05-03T08:06:31.000Z,jnar11,Best fitness app!!,"I have so many fitness apps in my phone but this one is an absolute gem! It is one stop shop for everything related to fitness and nutrition, starting right from dance classes, yoga, meditation, exercises keeping in mind specific area or part of the body, strength and endurance etc. to nutrition, healthy food recipes and what not! The instructors are super motivating! You could choose between live classes or recorded sessions as per convenience. Undoubtedly the best app for health!"
39,39,3,2020-08-12T22:53:28.000Z,Sunil-Sunny,Unexpected changes,"Disappointed to see that the option of switching countries has been removed and all the content is now locked behind a paywall rather than just the live sessions. If you see it absolutely necessary to start charging for something you used to provide for free then giving us the option to only chose fitness packs rather than pay for things we won‚Äôt use as well would be appreciated. The app itself is excellent, as is all the content provided which is why it doesn‚Äôt get a rating lower than 3."

This is complete mind and body guide that also covers mind and food for healthy body. They have been adding many new features every week. Kudos to the thinking of all around health experience. If I visit Cult Center after the lockdown, this app is going to be the sole reason. Also thanks for keeping most of it free. You guys rock !"

44,44,5,2020-12-26T03:46:34.000Z,Lvnvss,Fantastic for yoga,This app is fantastic for guided yoga. The asanas work for me. My back and neck pain have vanished after continuously doing some of these asanas. One small request. It would be fantastic if we could favourite or mark some of the videos. I usually do one session many times before going on to the others. So i am finding it difficult to search for some of these at a later point
45,45,4,2019-12-11T03:33:48.000Z,Nileet,Love the App. We are cult!,I just love the app to the core. I use it everyday to book classes and for reviewing my progress! I use if almost everyday of my life. It has made life easy! I would give it a 5 rating if you could improve in some areas.
46,46,5,2020-06-26T05:43:32.000Z,EK9304,So amazing. Thank you!,"The team and management at Cult are doing such a great service to this country. Free fitness classes, great healthy good, a much needed focus on mental health and mindfulness! It‚Äôs really really amazing and to be completely honest I don‚Äôt know how I would have been able to survive these 3 months of lockdown without your great fitness classes! I also love the fact that your classes even have international trainers!!"
47,47,2,2019-11-30T03:52:20.000Z,vikasknr,Still improvement is needed,I have been using Eat fit for subscription for couple of months. Food is good but the over all experience isn‚Äôt up to the mark. Main issue with the support. Help section in the app is literally useless and you can‚Äôt reach the support or open an issue immediately. You will be always ended up to frequently asked questions and more or less it is generic and it won‚Äôt help. Only option is send an email and wait for the reply. I had experience this couple of times. No way you can directly reach support.

51,51,1,2018-09-03T18:05:11.000Z,Fss9,Worst experience,"Being a platform in the health domain, I ordered food from this app. In the payment confirmation page I was shown that order got canceled, so I ordered again. Then in my orders section I saw that two orders got placed. I requested for the cancellation of second order so that I would receive only one. After the delivery time got passed when I enquirer about order, I was informed that accidentally both orders got cancelled."
52,52,1,2018-11-22T14:08:32.000Z,anu_maradani,Not recommended at all,They just say unlimited classes but wont allow you to book as many classes you want  . You can only book 4 classes in 4 days which is not what i was told . They do not follow a particular schedule in conducting classes . Few branches in hyderabad are pathetic built in very small areas . The washrooms are tightly packed . For yoga classes people will be standing around watching you which is quite awkward . Only few branches have separate area/hall the rest are just open where people walk in with shoes in the mrng and in the evening we put our face on the same carpet while doing yoga .

Getting the fitness goal kicked off, tracked through an app is much needed in current lifestyle chaos and  this app is doing it at its best. Right from registration, it was a pleasant experience. As mentioned in title, if you are committed to this app, this will make you sedentary to swiftly. Happy Cult üòä"

I just been to cult Habsiguda to checkout how they are training. Staff has said me to observe for 15 mins how they are training. You don‚Äôt believe, it just took 2-3 minutes to take a decision. It was an incredible experience. I never looked back I joined it the very next moment."

And also, your energy score works more like a timer. Even if I am standing still in front of the camera the energy points keep on increasing. In fact, just my one hand raise gets me a boost bar. It would be great if you could fix the above issues"

One of the best things is that there is no hassle and is so structured that you can do your workout efficiently. Also the feedback is taken such that they call you and check with you if you‚Äôre unsatisfied with the workout. Very real and dynamic.

62,62,3,2019-01-04T12:51:36.000Z,nikitaiyer,UI /UX (experience),The pink plus sign absolutely does not indicate that I have to click there to book a class. I searched for a long time to book a class and went all over the app to find it as a First time user. I ended up elsewhere instead. I had to call a friend and ask for help. Also too many distractions on the app from there goal the person is coming for. It‚Äôs ok if a person wants to explore but not ok if they want to see when their class starts etc.

I love the sheer variety of workouts that are available and the trainers are fantastic. The app is near perfect. It would be perfect if you could add a search option so that one could search for a workout either by name of the trainer, name of the workout, or type of workout."
66,66,4,2020-04-27T13:52:55.000Z,shailbeer,About some updates,"At first it is a very good and useful app. And i have some good suggestions for you guys, that you should keep a data record of user that what health conditions one have and weather one is a beginner or a experienced person. With the help of this, one can do exercises what he or she can able to, instead getting confused that which exercise one should do at very first and followed."

I am against this culture for many reasons: there is no adequate space or infrastructure for smelly shoes, it is unhygienic, you don‚Äôt know if the person has cleaned the shoes, time wastage, poor sight etc etc. This is not Delhi gym culture .

The gym is nice and workout intensities are good but the slot booking algorithm is pathetic. You‚Äôll never find a class of your choice however in advance you try to book. There must be a better way to get around this. The waitlist feature doesn‚Äôt seem to fix it.

Fancy from top but it's bad at the core. The video buffer time is in minutes when high quality videos are buffering at very good rate at all the prominent other applications. Fitness center is fine. The good thing is the intensity at which they train. Just started, so I can't comment on their exercises and their patterns though."

I fully paid the membership for the entire year . I was late for . 7 minutes to my third class due to last minute emergency. I marked the attendance, however was simply denied access to the class by the management. In my previous two sessions, nobody from cult side explicitly told me that you can‚Äôt be even 5 minutes late to any class otherwise entry won‚Äôt be allowed. I politely asked the manager to give me this one time exception as I was not aware of the rules . Also , anyone can have last minute emergency and if that has not been a pattern of that person. Nobody listened and was humiliated in front of the whole group and was simply advised to leave . I am a working professional in the service industry and understands the importance of rules and punctuality . I respect the culture of discipline . However one time exception to that person who wasn‚Äôt even told the proper rules should have been taken into consideration as a courtesy . Top of it , I am paying for the session. Also they have a no show policy , if you don‚Äôt turn up for any class pre-booked , they would reduce the same number of days from the membership duration. A person who is coming late has to come to the class to avoid being marked as a no- show even though entry to the class will be denied . Am I studying in some school ? I understand how a customer treatment and experience can be deal breaker. In this case , it has been for me . I would never ever recommend cult to any of my friends, family members or colleagues."

I would just suggest THINk TWICE before ordering food or subscribing on this app. No one know where they prepare and how they do...,, Pathetic app"
998,998,1,2019-06-02T09:21:04.000Z,nikkkkita,Pathetic customer service & false schemes,"Cure.fit‚Äôs customer care service is degrading day by day. They don‚Äôt care about your demands, they only care about their own benefit. I was supposed to get extension for referring a friend to join cult who joined cult successfully but they gave me no extension, even though it was their own marketing scheme. Moreover, I was supposed to get extension after resuming my pack, they first said they will give the extension but they didn‚Äôt do so. I sent them an email again saying they haven‚Äôt given the extension and they simply ignored it. After a day or two, I sent them an email again for them to reply. I legit had to remind them to reply to me. Even then they‚Äôre unwilling to give extension, their records are not updated. They have no clue about the timings I paused and resumed my pack. And the worst part is- they didn‚Äôt comply with their own statements. They said they would give extension, but they didn‚Äôt. There have been many other instances like this. Their customer support staff is highly incompetent."

If asked customer service person gives arrogant and rude answers. And we get a message saying delivery person is at our location and need to collect order at earliest else it will return. But there won‚Äôt be any one at our location. So disappointed with the service

1014,1014,1,2018-06-01T17:07:19.000Z,pj_priyanka,No 6 AM classes!!,"I joined mind.fit because I liked that they had daily 6 AM classes on all days. Within a few weeks of joining, they have removed 6 AM classes on alternate days. And the 7 AM class is usually extremely crowded. So now I have signed up for a ten month membership that i cannot use because the administration decided to do away with time slots at their own discretion - probably they do not make profit if the classes are not overflowing. Tomorrow if they do not get enough members, they may cut down on the classes further. Be careful before you join! And don‚Äôt pay for long term memberships!"
1015,1015,4,2018-06-29T06:18:37.000Z,Su Gowda,The best App ever!,"An amazing App! Due to rain or any damn reasons we cannot workout some days But from the day I have downloaded I have been working out 3 to 5 sessions throughout the day. Men can go out any time to the cult fit centres but for a women or a mother like me this app is a gift. Fitness trainer Shwetabari Shetty is just awesome, her way of motivating me feels she is watching. Only thing I would say is, it would be better if you increase the duration of each session. Thank You."
