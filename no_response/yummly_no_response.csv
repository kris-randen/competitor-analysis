0,0,5,2018-07-14T17:26:48.000Z,Tina Nessa Ceon,Best Recipe App for All kinds of people,"I love Yummly, I don‚Äôt remember how I found out about it. But it has been a lifesaver, it‚Äôs great to save recipes I find online that I want to look at later and not get lost in the bookmark section of my phone. It‚Äôs also good for a vegan like me to find recipes, but also serving size and nutrition facts.I scan look at all the  egan recipes in one place instead of looking them up online and finding out it isn‚Äôt vegan. Plus I can look for recipes using certain ingredients I have laying around. They have such a inclusive dietary preference all types of vegetarians, paleo, plus all kinds of allergies. They have now guided videos, I‚Äôll check those out soon and see what they‚Äôre like. I honestly can‚Äôt think of anything to complain about. It‚Äôs a useful tool for me and one of the must-have food apps on my phone.  All the other exclusively  vegan recipe apps , or just general apps are overpriced and don‚Äôt do half the things Yummly does or if they do you have to pay a ridiculous subscription fee. The best part it is all free! Not a free app with a lot limitations on certain recipes, but there‚Äôs a premium membership with access to over thousand of recipes and videos. Or it‚Äôs a free trial , it‚Äôs actually legitimately free, I mean it has prompted recipes from brand companies but its clearly labeled. Plus I mean the app has to be paid for somehow. If that‚Äôs the only ads I‚Äôve got to deal with, I‚Äôll take it!"
1,1,5,2020-05-15T09:47:06.000Z,BellaTricina,Great source for wide variety of recipes!,"My sister and I are fanatics for cooking and absolutely love to find new ideas to try out. Her and I have been using Yummly for probably, 5-7 years? It‚Äôs been a good long while! Some recipes still need a judgement call on them as they need to be edited some for errors - some are exact copies of others - and some are just completely far from a recipe (open can of soup, add water and cook on stove till warm). Then there are the majority that are good recipes and ideas. My sister and I have made countless recipes from this app and will for as long as there is this app probably just simply because it is a fun pass time of ours to just go recipe window licking and just make a weekly or monthly planner of meals from time to time..."
2,2,5,2019-01-02T16:41:58.000Z,Shelbi W.,I love this app!!!,"The design of this app is awesome. It manages to pull recipes from many sources smoothly, and it‚Äôs great about searching specific ingredients/certain types of meals. It consolidates all the recipe info in a clean, straightforward way, so when you spot something you want to try you can quickly see nutritional info, ingredients, prep time etc. from the app, without having to scroll through the actual site the recipe was posted on trying to find all that information (if you choose to make the meal you will THEN go to the full recipe site for the directions, but it‚Äôs still from within the app). It lets you create different lists, which I really like, and you can even tell it to create shopping lists for you based on the recipe you‚Äôve picked. You can also tell it what ingredients you have on hand and it‚Äôll will give you recipes that you can make using those ingredients, or what time you plan on eating something. It will give you reminders on when to start prepping the meal if you give it a time. So cool."
3,3,4,2018-11-23T05:57:52.000Z,HappyGoLucky1970,Yummy Yummly,"I‚Äôm a major Foodie. I have found so many incredible and interesting recipes on Yummly. Even ones I‚Äôve used over the years myself. I really enjoy the ability to research so easily. I try a lot of recipes that fall into several different categories. So it‚Äôs always a pleasure to come on to the app and be able to research in less time than books, especially when the recipes give you nutritional information that is accurate."
4,4,4,2020-05-02T18:19:29.000Z,TheTonsilBoxer,Awesome app! But always room for improvement,"I love this app and use it just about every week depending on how busy the schedule is. There‚Äôs recipes for almost everything on here. Every recipe I‚Äôve found has detailed instructions for prep and cooking. I can almost guarantee you will find what you‚Äôre looking for here. Convenient meals available at your fingertips. Only spots for improvement in my opinion is not having pop ups to go to some blog every time you want instructions for a recipe. The instructions should be right on the app itself. Not that it‚Äôs a major hassle or anything but sometimes I don‚Äôt want to read about how much mom loves this recipe and wants to stroke it for ten minutes before she shares her secrets with us, who just want simple instructions so we can accomplish making the meal and enjoying it with family/friends. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, sometimes I really enjoy reading the blogs when they‚Äôre well written or I‚Äôm in an interested mood. It would just be cool to have the option of looking at plain instructions along with going to the blogs as well. Also an improvement would be being able to see the recipes my mom has saved or yum‚Äôd, and vice versa. Because cooking with mom is how most of us learned or started to learn!"
5,5,4,2019-10-12T17:52:48.000Z,bogustorequirenamereally,Very good,"Good app. Relatively easy to use. Great customize categories for ‚Äòfiling‚Äô recipes. Very good content. I will keep using. Could be a little more intuitive on tech side, esp when searching for recipes. It‚Äôs nice to search by ingredient/omit ingredient, & would be better if could just search categories of food by type of food or main ingredient or basic type of recipe name...in other words the equivalent of searching by subject at the library. Have found it hard to do that. When opening a traditional cookbook/recipe book, you can do so and it‚Äôs efficient, esp w/an index. It took me 45+ min to find a recipe the other day. Easier access to FULL recipes would be better/appreciated, although I understand why clicking to the recipe author‚Äôs scroll-thru-29-ads-and-other-misc-stuff-to-get-to-free-full-recipe-directions is necessary in the current pay-for-play-with-time/distraction/ads/broken up text-model of receiving ‚Äúfree‚Äù content via electronic media/apps. I‚Äôm not sure if there is a paid version of Yummly and even more important, I have my doubts that a paid version would eliminate the above mentioned scroll-thru-15pages to get to full recipes/instructions."
6,6,5,2019-04-10T16:07:13.000Z,Karen WMS,Yummly in my tummly,"I‚Äôve been using the Yummly app for a few years now.  I can find every recipe I am searching for, and believe me it has come in handy.  In the last year I‚Äôve switched diets from Mediterranean to Vegan to Keto, now I‚Äôm low carb.  All the while I‚Äôm gluten free.  The app makes it easy to obtain allergy free recipes and recipes geared toward my diet.  I also receive emails from Yummly.  Just before Christmas I receive cool kitchen recommendations.  I may put some items on my Christmas list for me or buy items for my friends and family.  I am an avid gardener and sometimes need fresh new ideas for an over abundance of vegetables or fruits.  With Yummly I can search the vegetables name and find all sorts of recipes.  This year I canned my very own tomato sauce with a Yummly recipe!   I also learned how to cut a whole chicken in half and roast it!  The amount of ‚ÄúYums‚Äù on each recipe make it simple for me to chose what recipe I want to try if multiple recipes pop up under my search. I‚Äôm rating Yummly 5 stars because I can always find an outstanding recipe to suit my and my family‚Äôs needs."
7,7,3,2020-12-13T21:24:20.000Z,Fun/awesome/cool,Updated - lowered to 3 - plus it a couple of suggestions,I gave it 4 stars but I‚Äôm down to three right now.  I respect the right to have a paid/subscription service but if I‚Äôm not interested in that please let me know if I‚Äôm going to have an offer thrown in my face every-single-time I start the app.  I don‚Äôt mind periodic reviews but I am getting annoyed.  When I get annoyed I begin to look at alternatives.
8,8,4,2021-03-10T05:21:08.000Z,shortstuff_29,"Love this, but...",I love this app. My husband introduced me to it a couple years back and we both use it on a weekly basis. The layout makes it less intimidating when finding something new to cook. It has options to help with shopping and has videos from chefs to help with some recipes (you have to pay for that portion.) which is nice.
9,9,1,2021-04-18T18:55:21.000Z,YummlyNoGood,Cancel subscription,"Yummly has too many ads, requires multiple clicks to get to the heart of a recipe, and profiles recipes for me that don‚Äôt fit my needs. But what is the most frustrating is trying to cancel my subscription. It‚Äôs a never ending do-loop of logging into website to access my account, then being sent an email that asks me to sign in. I have then gotten to the place to cancel my subscription, which I do, but then the website will not allow me to cancel my account until I have canceled my subscription, which I have already done (or think I‚Äôve done). But at each step, I have to log in to website where it again sends me an email with link to sign in and I have to start all over.  It just keeps repeating. This doesn‚Äôt make any sense, does it? No. I can‚Äôt even explain what is happening because it is utter nonsense. I want to cancel my subscription and delete my account. And it doesn‚Äôt appear that I can.  So, my advice is to avoid this app at all costs. It‚Äôs a trap and there are better cooking apps out there. And if I did successfully cancel my subscription, please cancel my account.  I have tried multiple times and it just keeps telling me that I need to cancel my subscription first.  Which I tried to do.  That‚Äôs how bad this is."
10,10,5,2018-06-30T02:26:56.000Z,Egghead101üòã,"Amazing, so many good features","Yummly is a great app. I have found so many recipes on the app that I never would have found otherwise! If you aren‚Äôt sure about a recipe, just look at the reviews for the recipe. Reviewing recipes is honestly such a good idea, as most recipe-filled websites or apps don‚Äôt have such features, meaning that you have no idea if the food will turn out well. You can save the recipes, which is another great feature. Find a recipe you would like to try? Just save it so you don‚Äôt have to go back and find it later. If you are planning on making several different things at the same time, you can add the ingredients you need to the shopping list on Yummly, sorted by category of foods. When you first log on to Yummly, the user can choose what foods they dislike, what they are allergic to, if they are on any diets, and what kinds of dishes they enjoy preparing. This filters the recipes you see, and you can then find more recipes you would like. Yummly is my #1 choice as a baker and chef."
11,11,4,2018-09-02T23:05:17.000Z,kaylaxoxijsodnhd,AWESOME...But just one thing...,"Yummly is seriously so amazing and I'm surprised I haven't heard about it until now. It definitely inspires me to want to cook more often. Also, the way you can filter through recipes is so cool. I will usually look for different recipes on Pinterest, but this app just makes everything so much easier. You see something that looks good, and can instantly save it. Then you just tap the picture, and boom you have the recipe. Also the way you can filter your allergy/diet specifications is one the coolest things about the entire app! The only thing I wish it did have (and i understand this isn't very high demand compared to diet) is a weight GAIN filter. Thats one of the toughest things that I struggle with, with having such a high metabolism, is finding HEALTHIER meals that help you gain weight(more protein,calories) . If there was even just an option in the ‚ÄúNutrition‚Äù filter where you can select ‚Äúhigher calorie amount‚Äù or something like that, would be super awesome. Just my personal feedback and this is the ONLY negative thing that I have to say about Yummly! :-)"
12,12,5,2018-09-24T00:59:30.000Z,St1ac2ey3,Best recipe app!!!,"I‚Äôve tried pretty much all the recipe apps and this is by far the best. I use it nearly every day. I have food allergies. Yummly let‚Äôs me select foods I‚Äôm allergic to along with foods I don‚Äôt like. That‚Äôs nice because it allows me to expand my allergy list. I can pick a specific diet. In our case, pescatarian. I can also pick our favorite cuisines like Mediterranean, Greek, Indian, etc. I‚Äôve not found a lot of the other food apps to be so specific at narrowing down your searches. I don‚Äôt want to see foods I‚Äôm not interested in."
13,13,3,2019-02-18T02:43:43.000Z,MelGreer,Almost There,This a review of the app only.
14,14,5,2019-05-04T21:38:04.000Z,valek360,This app got me to start cooking!,"I was telling myself that I will start cooking more for months... There were times where I would cook for a week and then it would wane for a couple weeks because I wasn‚Äôt really sure what I was capable of cooking. Looking at food blogs was becoming tiresome because I wasn‚Äôt really sure what I was looking for... Enter: Yummly. I downloaded the app after seeing an ad on Instagram and I was immediately hooked. The UI is super intuitive and and satisfying to use. I can simply just type in what I‚Äôm in the mood for (e.g., ‚Äúchicken breast‚Äù) and then I have a plethora of diverse recipe options to choose from. It is so simple to browse through recipes on the bus, find something I‚Äôm in the mood for, add the ingredients to my shopping list with the click of a button, and then use the app as I walk around the store to ensure I get everything. Highly recommend!!!"
15,15,4,2020-11-10T01:02:11.000Z,Hads3,Can I ‚ÄúYum‚Äù Yummly?!,I have been using (and loving) Yummly for years. I love it for gathering and saving recipes. I also use it to meal plan and create my grocery list. I‚Äôve recommended it to many people when they ask where I find my recipes.
16,16,5,2021-03-07T16:46:23.000Z,"Jenny from the...1,6",Great!,"It‚Äôs the best free recipe app! You can save recipes to different categories. The app starts you off with some categories, but you can create your own categories that make sense to you so that you can easily find what you have a taste for. You can click on ingredients right from the recipe, & they go to your shopping list which is organized by type (produce, meat, etc.). You can check it off in the app as you buy it, but it doesn‚Äôt disappear. It just moves to a completed section of your list, then you delete it when you want. In the shopping list, it also tells you what recipe the ingredient is for, AND you can get to the recipe right from the specific ingredient in your shopping list. ü§ó There are SO many recipes too AND different recipes for (ways to make) the same dish. Some recipes for a dish may be easier or have a different twist. There is so much possibility."
17,17,5,2019-10-09T17:47:42.000Z,Unsur3Future,Awesome!,"I have made more meals in a week than I ever have! Meal planning was always so hard for me to do with a little one - never enough time to look up recipes, always forgetting something at the store, etc. but with Yummly, I have been able to get all my groceries in ONE trip to the store, and find the recipes easily! My favorite new find in this app is that you can set a schedule on your calendar that will remind you when you need to start prepping the ingredients & throwing it all together to have it done by the dinner time you‚Äôd want!! THAT is HUGE for me!! I am very bad at planning out the meal prep time, always causing our meals to run into the night, or having to throw some last minute dinner together that is below exceptional."
18,18,1,2020-12-31T15:51:43.000Z,Petrichor7th,Worst Recipe App without a doubt,"I hated their website and app several years ago when I tried to use. But one of my dear friend sent me a recipe ‚ÄúSuper Energy Kale Soup‚Äù via email I tried click the link and open it in my browser, ingredients comes up but when I click ‚Äúget directions‚Äù , that page never stop loading and nothing comes up. I‚Äôm kind of person who have insane amount patient!! So I go to App Store and download the app, and follow through the 10 minutes worth of crap to finish signing up, then even get the pro version. I searched for the kale soup recipe and and when it came up I clicked ‚Äú get directions‚Äù, same thing happened and it opens a blank page. Now most people would give up by then, but I decided to try one more recipe to see if only that one kale recipe soup has issue, but second and third recipe same thing. I use an IPhone XR and all the software are up to date. I don‚Äôt care what million other people say, after spending 25 minutes of my life I will never get back... this is the worst recipe app or to be honest any app I have ever used. Your incompetence is nothing short of unspeakable!!"
19,19,3,2019-12-01T20:19:23.000Z,SarahASmall,Great App for Certain Uses,"This is a great app to find new recipes, but it is not so friendly when you want to save and compile recipes that you already use. I was able to find many, but not all, of the recipes I like to use (from certain blogs/websites). I do not use any filters, so I am unsure why the search function does not recognize certain recipes that easily come u when I google search. To my knowledge, there is NO function to either import a missing recipe from another link or manually enter a recipe (that may not be online)."
20,20,4,2018-04-22T13:44:37.000Z,Mistress of Awesome,Love this app but needs a notes feature,"I've been using this app for a week and it's already basically changed my life. I can much more easily find recipes to try, add all the ingredients to my shopping list, and schedule what night I want to cook each meal. I'm saving money because I'm not eating out, and my family is happy because they aren't getting the same three meals on constant rotation. HOWEVER. I have one quibble. It appears there is no way to leave yourself a note on a particular recipe (like ""try this with half the sugar next time,"" or ""this is my new favorite but the husband doesn't care for it, so make it when he's out""). I instead have to rely on leaving public reviews for each recipe that includes my notes, which isn't ideal. If they were to fix this issue to allow users to leave private notes on recipes, I would easily give this app five stars, as it is otherwise fantastic."
21,21,5,2018-09-01T19:10:01.000Z,SEAHAWKER1,A M A Z I N G : a thorough review,"Right away when you get the app it gives you a quiz about foods you prefer and don‚Äôt prefer, if you have any food allergies, or if you are on a diet. You can always change these in settings. There is a home page of foods the app thinks you would like and an explore page if you want to try new things. There is also a search bar. All of the recipes have the nutritional facts and tell you how long it takes to make. You can also set a reminder on the app of when you would like to start preparing your meal. You can give the recipes reviews and comments. You can also save the foods you want to make and there is even a way to organize your saved recipes.  You can even make a shopping list on the app and there is a spot on the app where it tells you of good cooking tools you can buy from different brands. Love this app!"
22,22,4,2018-11-21T16:56:25.000Z,HJbfun,Yummly is yum but...,"I have recently noticed a deterioration in the simplicity of your app. Other sites are posting within your site and it‚Äôs becoming very frustrating. For example, If I want ‚ÄúAllrecipes‚Äù site, I would go there.  Unfortunately, now when I click on a recipe now it could take me to another site where there are unrelated recipes. Not only can I not find their version on the recipe, but there is no way too search for it within their app. This is wasting my time and forcing me to click multiple recipes just to find one that takes me directly to what I‚Äôm searching for. One of the things I loved about your app was the ability to go directly to the recipe that was posted and look at the overview of ingredients prior to viewing the recipe. I hope you can fix this issue. This is getting too hard!"
23,23,5,2019-03-07T02:57:08.000Z,Erin McClain,Life changing app üôåüëè,I never agree to write reviews for apps but this one deserves it. I love this app! I use it every single day for at least one meal if not more ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòã Yummly has the most amazing options and filters. It coordinates how long the prep and cooking take and can even add a reminder to your phone calendar to notify you of when to begin your meal based off the time you want to serve it. It lets you select if you have a food allergy and will choose recipes without that. It lets you list foods or ingredients you dislike and will choose receives without those. It has an option to let you list what ingredients you might have laying in your refrigerator or pantry and will show you a recipe with those ingredients. And it even lets you take pictures of food/ingredients and will help you identify them to choose a recipe based off that. Great app. Thank you!!!
24,24,5,2019-05-25T18:33:12.000Z,"C'est moi, cherie","Great app, prompt support","The Yummly app is great because it compiles recipes from all over, which I would be too search-fatigued to track down myself. (At the end of the day, let‚Äôs all admit it: we want to spend less time on electronic devices and more time living.) I also really appreciate being able to tell it to exclude certain ingredients; for example, if you avoid soy, it can be excluded; and during Lent you can exclude meat and then reintroduce it later in settings."
25,25,5,2020-06-01T15:38:19.000Z,omgELIZABETHHH,Love this app,"I have been using this app for probably around 7 years now. Definitely my go-to app for recipes. This app makes it super easy to find what you‚Äôre looking for by asking questions like what kind of protein you want in your dish, desired cooking time, number of ingredients, type of ingredients, dietary restrictions, etc. in order to filter the recipes. When you find recipes you want to save for later, you can create categories (I have one called ‚ÄúRecipes for Dad‚Äù where I save easy recipes that I know he can make) or use the ones that come with the app (breakfast, lunch, dinner) to sort them. The recipes always show a rating and written reviews from people who have made them. I find this extremely helpful in deciding which recipes to make and how to alter them based on reviews. Overall, this app is super bomb and I recommend it to everyone!"
26,26,5,2019-11-22T13:56:43.000Z,landonewts,"Huge variety of recipes, very useful","Yummly is a great app for finding, collecting and storing recipes. Yes, Google also works well for finding recipes, but Yummly gives you a virtual storage place to collect your recipes, sort by type, and each recipe has a shopping list function as well as detailed instructions."
27,27,3,2020-05-04T12:10:34.000Z,Danny Boy100,"Can‚Äôt find what I want ‚Äî impossible you say, right?","It is an anomaly ‚Äî what with the hundreds of recipes ‚Äî there are times when I have searched for something so simple that, instead of simple, I get everything but. Take just a basic beets-from-a-can recipe, for example. All I wanted was how to jazz this veggie up, especially since now ‚Äúcanned‚Äù almost everything is safer than fresh. Try it yourself: you will get a page that gets stuck, literally, on ‚Äúmarinated‚Äù beets that you practically need to power off to get to another page ‚Äî going to the back button won‚Äôt do. Or you get exotic recipes for ‚Äúfresh‚Äù beet dishes. What I needed were some herbs and spices that go well with beets ‚Äúfrom a can.‚Äù Who has the time to plow through every fancy recipe to find one or two ‚Äúherb/spice‚Äù suggestions? A section on what basic herbs and spices go with each category (canned or fresh) ‚Äî like carrots, green beans, peas, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, corn etc. ‚Äî  would be a welcome addition."
28,28,5,2020-08-15T01:02:32.000Z,Shinelikegloss,Only recipe app I use.,I love this app. I can save recipes (and they make it so easy to do) and I can categorize them too. I love being able to customize my apps like that. This is pretty much the only app I use for recipes. I don‚Äôt even google that stuff anymore. Yummly has nearly everything I want when it comes searching for recipes.
29,29,5,2020-05-04T14:52:23.000Z,Suznuz,My go to recipe site,"Whenever I am trying to figure out what to cook today, I start with Yummly. Especially now that I am trying to use whatever I have in my refrigerator and pantry. I love that I can just put a few ingredients in my search query and a slew of recipes from sites all over the web pop up."
30,30,5,2018-05-10T04:00:05.000Z,The Taco Lady,Nice app to find a variety of recipes,Love the app. There is one thing about it that I‚Äôm not 100% sold on: some (most) recipes link to an external website. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be a link. Users just have to put in the instructions which they don‚Äôt usually do. It would be nice to not have to go through a webpage within Yummly to get the directions of the recipe because the ingredients are listed on Yummly anyway (for nutrition facts on each recipe which I dig). At that point it‚Äôs not really a problem with the app if the users aren‚Äôt making use of the feature so no star taken off for that.
31,31,5,2018-11-19T19:08:24.000Z,BLU3LINEN,Pleasantly surprised,I was looking for recipes to make for thanksgiving and I needed fast and multiple food options. Yummly quickly sorted out the ones I wanted and the ones I didn‚Äôt want. It gives me a planning time to work with and lots of new food ideas! I would recommend it to people who have to make meals for special occasions like Christmas or thanksgiving but normal day to day uses are also very good.
32,32,4,2019-04-30T16:19:45.000Z,borealis89,Love it! With just a few exceptions...,"It‚Äôs easy to use on the computer or app. I can quickly find recipes that interest me based on dietary preferences, specific ingredients, or other search filters. I love the shopping cart feature, it‚Äôs very helpful when I‚Äôm at the store because I can add everything I need and have it all in one place without taking the time to write it down."
33,33,3,2019-05-17T14:00:07.000Z,janeho2011,Needs Improved Calendar Integration,After a week of using the Yummly app I would give it 3.5 stars out of 5. My biggest pet peeve is that it only wants to sync to my Apple calendar. I really only use the google calendar app on my phone and in my general life so that‚Äôs been one issue with the app. I would like it a lot better if the app gave me the option of choosing to schedule directly to the google calendar app.
34,34,5,2020-12-24T22:35:52.000Z,#2KINGS,Genius cooking,"For anyone who has ever shopped in a supermarket while hungry, it is the worst - you buy everything you crave, and sometimes have nothing that actually ‚Äúgoes together‚Äù in a healthy fashion.  Yummly is FANTASTIC for breaking the process of cooking/preparing down to: being able to shop in your fridge/freezer/cabinets before you go to the supermarket.  You can get exactly what you need - look at nearby stores that have the ingredients - and basically shop before you even leave your kitchen.  Also, Yummly gives allows you to time all of the preparation and desired eat time that you would like - and all of this can change: to the day/time, which is wonderful.  I enjoy this application immensely - even doing recipes that sound so bizarre."

36,36,5,2021-05-22T02:13:26.000Z,Jaime Dacal,Useful,Yummly aggregates recipes pretty well. It always gives me lots of options.
37,37,5,2020-12-01T17:25:48.000Z,lenymars,Yumly makes cooking a breeze!,"A few years ago I was in a rut cooking the same recipes week after week.  My two kids would ask, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs for dinner mom?‚Äù If I said chicken, they would reply ‚ÄúNo! Not chicken again!‚Äù With the voice of agony that I never want to hear again! It made me realize how boring and routine my cooking had become.  Not wanting to disappoint again,  I quickly started looking for a solution to our problem.  I found yumly and my kids are now wondering what new and exiting recipe I will make each day!! I can‚Äôt thank yumly enough and I share about it with my friends every time I get a chance!! Thank you! From the bottom of my heart and the bottom of my kids bellies!!! My kids will never be bored with my cooking again!!!"

This is a very stable website that I use multiple times a day & appreciate it for what it offers users. Thanks Yummly!!"
39,39,3,2020-12-03T19:29:28.000Z,NewMexReader,Searching needs work!,"I use the app because I like how it gathers from so many sources.  I don‚Äôt like a few things .  The search by ingredients function gives limited choices and no ability to customize the search.  Also, When typing into search, there is no spell check so for example, if you are looking for an exotic dish, you have to know EXACTLY how to spell it.  Or if you just can‚Äôt remember how to spell cauliflower, it doesn‚Äôt help you.  The MOST annoying thing is that there is no ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù function.  If you were just deciding between recipes and didn‚Äôt Yum all of them, you cant find them again without starting at the beginning. I also wish there was a way to save a recipe to a file before I decide to Yum it, or review it.  For example seeing that a recipe has been Yummed 39 times with one review, tells me little."

I‚Äôve been trying to eat healthier for stomach/digestive reasons I've had my whole life and this app has made that so easy for me. I‚Äôm not a chef by any stretch of the imagination, but it allows me to customize my dietary restrictions and them sends me emails weekly or puts recipes on my feed that fit in those restrictions. They even will tell you what recipes are the fastest and easiest if you‚Äôre not the best cook, like me but getting there(!), or just want a snack. I even started the Whole30 and it suggests recipes that are Whole30 friendly. Without the support of this app, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it. Thanks guys! Good work!"

I usually bulk shop for the month, and buy produce and dairy fresh when I need them. Being able to make my list directly from the app, choosing all ingredients I need and have it at my finger tips makes this busy mom look like she spent hours cooking !! Still get a great, healthy , customized meal!! Love it !! Wish it would sync to my calendar tho. Still struggling with trying to fix that. Not sure if it‚Äôs the app, or my calendar.

My husband, who used to do the majority of the cooking, is thoroughly impressed by my new talent! Everything I‚Äôve made has turned out perfectly and has been revisited several times.

I rate most apps that truly deserve my praise!!!!! This is truthfully one of the best I‚Äôve ever seen!!!

The interface design pops off the screen with bright high quality images of foods. The app allows easy navigation to all categories whether articles, recipes or the shopping list. The app is resourceful in many ways. For example users can get suggestions for meals just by scanning an ingredient you have at home. The app also collects recipes from other popular food sources such as Epicurious reducing the need for other applications or sources you rely on. It also works with Apple Health making it easier for whose who rely on the platform to guideline their well being. Yummly is well worth a download for all home chefs whether the free or Premium Pro version."

Before, I‚Äôd just use google, but it was difficult to keep things organized. Yummly has made it easy for me to search and save recipes that I want to attempt. I‚Äôve attempted a lot and the app lets me add all the ingredients to a shopping list too, which I love. With the added comments on recipes from the Yummly community, it helps me better understand what I‚Äôm in for when attempting a recipe (add more or less of an ingredient, cook longer/less, etc). I could go on and on about it. There are still features that I have yet to utilize. I just think it‚Äôs great and this app has single handedly fanned the flames of my passion for cooking at home."

Nearly every dish for which I request recipes is instantly provided in multiple versions, from simple to more involved. Many of the recipes have built-in videos to make the preparation process even simpler. Since I love the Instant Pot so much, I often search for recipes specifically for cooking in that device. Yummly focuses on that type of recipe nearly as much as I do, and they never fail to provide me with ingenious and delicious options for that cooking genre."

Just Googling recipes is fine for plenty of people, but when you have food allergies or dietary restrictions, it can become stressful. This is also the easiest way to filter by ingredients, the tool I use quite often. I even have recipes saved to try another day, gotta remember to buy some of those key ingredients! This does not eliminate my family resources for their recipes, it just lets me add something new to the rotation or plan for something interesting! About to make Salmon With Everything Bagel Seasoning from A Taste of Joy and Love for the second time this month. Not a paid review, just wanted to recommend it!!!"

There are a lot of good features to explore. I don‚Äôt even know the extent of it yet. And it is worth telling your friend about! I know I do all the time!"

Love the shopping list feature, you can creat 1 shopping list for multiple recipes for the 5 course meal  you plan to cook and it automatically sorts the items by grocery store depts (ex diary, meats, etc). Lastly the schedule feature is perfect, pick the day you plan to make receipe and when you want it to be ready and it will give you an alert/reminder on when to start prepping. I use this app more than I expected."

Its filters are super helpful, you can easily narrow down what you're looking for. Diet restrictions, ingredients on hand, time it takes to cook, methods of cooking, and so much more. It has quite a few options I haven't even tried yet, like pairing a smart thermometer with the app! I use it on a regular basis, and would absolutely recommend this app. The developers recently added a paid subscription option, but the free version is still super useful so they don't force you to pay for the subscription(they didn't throw in a bunch of adds when the premium version came out either!) So thats nice"

I‚Äôve used it for a couple of years and love that it‚Äôs full of food bloggers recipes and linked directly to their websites. I used to just google for recipes, but never found as many quality recipes as I do on Yummly. There‚Äôs a massive variety of recipes in this app and that‚Äôs what makes it priceless. You can set food preferences to make sure that each recipe that pops up is something you‚Äôd actually eat. The grocery list feature is the best. Saves you time and effort and you can add in others items you need. I tell all of my friends about this app and they always love it too."
57,57,5,2020-01-27T23:19:51.000Z,DSquared7,Best Cooking Database,"Great app! This app is my favorite. It‚Äôs awesome for individuals either looking to follow a particular diet (keto, low sodium, etc.) or just have other parameters or restrictions they need to adhere to. As opposed to vaguely browsing a search engine for something that stands out, this app makes it easy for me to say, ‚ÄúHey! I want chicken with cilantro but I only have 30 minutes or less‚Äù. Furthermore, seeing how many people have liked the recipe and being able to easily adjust the serving size is another plus. And I can‚Äôt forget about the ability to easily save and organize recipes that have interested me. I recommend this app to everyone! There are even drink recipes as well."

This app made it fun and easy to try new recipes and dishes. You can just type in pretty much anything you want into the search bar and have a number of different recipes to choose from. The ‚ÄúYum‚Äù function is awesome and I use it to save recipes and put them in ‚Äòlists‚Äô so I can go back and browse my past likes easily. For example, I have recipe lists for chicken, beef, (any other meats), sauces/marinades, desserts, holiday, etc. I‚Äôve really annoyed using this app (daily!) and recommend it to most everyone I meet that wants to get into cooking more. 5 stars all day."

It‚Äôs fun and easy to use. Not only is there so much variety but I love that it caters specifically to your needs, from selecting your allergies to selecting what dietary plan you have in mind. I would however love to see more videos on how these recipes are made. I still enjoy reading the articles on how these meals are made step by step but it sometimes makes it more fun and feels easier to make the recipe when you follow a video. Other than that, I‚Äôm very excited to continue to use this app to make some delicious meals."

I can find a recipe online and search for it by name and site then find it on Yummly as well to save it. I rate , review and add any notes to help me next time and even a picture if I feel like it.

It's easy to search for recipes, and I like how I can save recipes in different collections so if I want to make breakfast I can just click on my ""Breakfast"" collection and check out my options. For a long time I couldn't find the ""Yum"" Safari button to add recipes that aren't in the app, but I finally got it working so now I can even save recipes I find online. And I love how Yummly includes reviews, so I can see what other users thought about that recipe. This is a well-implemented app and I honestly can't think of anything it's missing."

But, I kind of have a love hate relationship with Yummly.  From the standpoint of tons of great recipes, 5 stars.  From the standpoint of ease of use and navigation, Yummly coulda kept huge improvements.  For example, if I want a seasonal appetizer, there is no way to easily find it.  I can search their appetizers, but I can‚Äôt filter their seasonal category down to appetizers.  Instead, I select seasonal and have to look through everything trying to find any appetizer.  With a database as massive as what Yummly has, they have done kind of a poor job with navigation.  Give the ability to do deeper and multilevel filters and it would be perfect."

I am from the Southern US and my style of cooking has been soul food. My husband has more creative tastes in food, and I‚Äôve been wanting to experiment with middle eastern and Mediterranean flavors.

I also am excited to try the new feature of recognizing ingredients and suggesting recipes.  That could make this a home run!!

I‚Äôm a working mom with two littles and used to feel so overwhelmed my meal planning. Yummly to the rescue! It‚Äôs SO easy to plan and schedule meals! Craving Mexican cuisine? Yummly‚Äôs got you. Starting a keto diet? No problem! There are tons of recipes. I love that the app alerts you when prep needs to start. This helps keep me on track. And the integration with Instacart? Game changer! I seriously had meals planned and groceries delivered to my house within two hours last weekend- all while still spending time with my baby. Thanks for all you do, Yummly!"
86,86,5,2020-08-16T20:09:41.000Z,JourneyBeyondSurvival,Love Yummly!,We have four people in our family. With Yummly we can all share one calendar on our phones and my two teens can plan their one family dinner where we can check up on their groceries or that they‚Äôve planned it out. I‚Äôve loved it for years.
87,87,5,2019-07-12T19:46:53.000Z,Chowartmama,Delicious Fun,"I have never had so much fun finding new dishes to try and enjoy. First of all, Yummly really works at getting you recipes that may be of interest to you based on your previous searches and saves. Then be ready to look all these gorgeous pictures of deliciousness lined up for you to peruse, salivate and eventually try out. If these were not enough, I would simply enter a couple of words in the search box and BAM!... more recipes!  I am new to vegan cooking and the selections here make me wonder why it took me so long to figure out what I've been missing all along. My body is thanking me for the healthier meals. And I thank Yummly."
88,88,1,2021-03-21T22:44:48.000Z,Liberty Venti,Chock full of advertisements and links,"Unless I am delusional, Yummly used to be much better.  Today, my wife sent me a link via text and it wouldn‚Äôt even load.  I searched for it and found it manually.  Then, I had to work my way around advertisements and unrelated images like a knight dangerously navigating the evil gauntlet of death.  Eventually, I made it to the recipe and had to read far to much fluff to get to the details.  Why does this have to be so difficult?   Is armor and weapons really necessary?   Can we just get a cooking / recipe app that is easy to use, has great relative pictures without all the linking and scrolling to circumvent the advertisements I‚Äôm  not going to pay one ounce of attention to anyway.  I‚Äôd pay for an app like that. A reasonable monthly fee that is shared across a single family would be appealing.  Much unlike this current app."

90,90,5,2019-03-30T11:09:30.000Z,Abraham Phillips,Amazing. Best app ever.,"I usually don‚Äôt write reviews but I absolutely had to, this app is great. It gives you thousands of recipes for any situation and give you so many options, it gives you a clean interface and gives you the ingredients and the directions to make whatever you want. It gives you all the calories, preparation time, and the amount of ingredients as soon as you click the  item with the amazing photos with them. It gives you all of the nutritional information right below the title. Absolutely love the app and is the only app I would use for recipes. 11/10. Amazing."
91,91,5,2019-05-20T15:01:22.000Z,BrewcrLi,Love it!,"This is the best recipe app I have ever used. It allows a lot of flexibility through search criteria and allows for diet considerations. I also like the shopping list for ingredients which is easy to use along with favorite tracking. Also, with questions, it suggests recipes. U can even find recipes based on ingredients. A few things I would like to see is the ability to customize what information is shown at-a-glance since I track carbs and not calories, user-friendly ‚Äò.‚Äô added when hitting space bar twice 4 comments,and mk the app upside-down compatible. Thanks for this great app!"
92,92,5,2020-06-11T16:45:33.000Z,diggerhead,Best App for organizing recipes,"I love to cook. I labeled folders based on the meal or type of dish (sides, desserts, breakfast, etc). These are the recipes I‚Äôd like to try. Then I have folders with all the same labels with the words ‚Äútried and true‚Äù. For example sides tried and true, desserts tried and true, breakfast tried and true, etc.  I also added a folder ‚Äúgross‚Äù. I put recipes that we didn‚Äôt enjoy, recipes that were not successful or something that we found a different recipe for the same thing we liked better. Even if it wasn‚Äôt gross, I would put it in there to know we don‚Äôt need to make that again."

It has great recipes with a wide variety, probably anything you could want to make! I didn‚Äôt give it five stars because it shows me pictures of a great sounding/looking meal but then, when I try to click for the recipe it won‚Äôt show me because you have to pay for it.... I just want the ingredients and the recipe, not the video... the premium recipes and regular recipes should be kept separate if there is no way to see without buying. I didn‚Äôt even watch the videos when they used to be free, I always just went to the recipe. I wonder what other changes will be made to this app :("
94,94,4,2020-06-16T16:45:48.000Z,Canelapanela,Started off great but crashing now,I got the app a few months ago and really liked it! It has all kinds of recipes from different types of traditional and fusion recipes. I liked that you could look recipes up based on ingredients or even events.
95,95,5,2020-07-12T00:03:57.000Z,Files Cleaned,Yummly Review,"I love the use of Yummly! It allows me to search for any recipe that I want, as well as giving me a lot of different recipes to choose from in different genres of food. It also tells me the calorie count as well as how long it would take to fix the food, which I find really helpful. It is also very user-friendly and easy to navigate. I also appreciate that I get emails of different recipes that I could try"
96,96,4,2021-01-02T01:01:26.000Z,Bnana123,It has saved my sanity!,"I love this app, but I will say more so initially than now. Initially, I was finding many recipes that appealed to me and many more than when I simply do an Internet search for specific recipes. After just one weekend of downloading the app, I had already tried 3 new recipes. That‚Äôs a record for me!  Not by choice, I have many dietary restrictions. This app has made it so much easier for me to find recipes that work for me; many of them are simple yet very tasty! More recently, though, I haven‚Äôt been able to find quite as many recipes that catch my eye. That‚Äôs why 4 stars instead of 5. But I still appreciate this app very much!"
97,97,3,2020-05-23T19:08:43.000Z,mike9317,soSo,With a previous update some months ago an upgrade occurred that installed a new version of the yummly app. Because I cannot migrate or export my saved Yummlies to the new app I have to use both the obsolete Yummly app & the new app instead of just  one. & with the last update of the new Yummly app some of the recipes I receive(d) in my email do not link to Yummly app. One or two of these recipes I could not find in the app itself only linking to the website. Adding Yummlies from website does not add them to the app. The directions links also has way too many popups that hinder reading the recipes.
98,98,5,2020-03-01T17:22:14.000Z,AZLuckemama,Best Recipe App  Ever!!,This recipe app is the most useful and well
99,99,3,2019-11-23T14:49:41.000Z,Cmac0,yummily review,"Yummily has some fabulous recipes, but I no longer will research your site. I have an impossible  time getting a full recipe that can either be placed in my recipe file or sent to my printer for future use. Also I will be in the middle of hand copying the recipe myself, which I honestly hate, and everything freezes. It is a shame that your recipes create so many roadblocks that someone like me just won‚Äôt even use it. I am sorry to write such a negative report, but it is a shame to see a website with so much potential be so useless. I even got the app hoping that would help, but no such luck. Hope something can be done to straighten out the bugs. I keep trying, but to no avail."
100,100,5,2018-07-22T16:22:31.000Z,JaimesonTheGreat,My thoughts and a suggestion,"Very good app. I often find myself grazing through the recipes in awe. Everything looks so good. I noticed that in the app, there is an option to ‚Äúbuy groceries‚Äù, and as useful as that is. I believe that, if i were able to take a stockpile list of saved recipes and get a composed grocery list of the items i would need to make each one of those meals (like a weekly meal planner), that would put this app over the top for me. I save many recipes, and its very time consuming to make this list as well as go through each recipe. But overall, very good and very helpful."

A friend introduced me to this app and I LOVE it! I have it customized to my cooking skills level (intermediate) so I don‚Äôt get recipes that are too complex. I also was able to set ingredient requirements‚Äîwe have a kid with a food allergy and I‚Äôve set my preferences so that I will not receive any recipe suggestions with the problem ingredient...amazing! It‚Äôs easy to search for recipe ideas and to organize the recipes you‚Äôve tried or want to try. Great app!"

103,103,4,2021-03-09T05:34:38.000Z,Mk218790356,I loved this app until recent updates,"I absolutely love this app! It has amazing recipes, however what‚Äôs really starting to make me frustrated is the recent updates. Whenever I go to the shop section to see the recipes I plan to cook it won‚Äôt actually take me the recipe I want if I were to click on the picture. Instead it will take me to another recipe that has absolutely nothing to do with the recipe I‚Äôm currently trying to view. So now I have to search for the recipe which can be frustrating when I need to cook, also the constant pop up asking me to buy the pro version is very annoying and frustrating."
104,104,4,2020-07-11T22:33:30.000Z,trevorflynn,Won‚Äôt save my login information anymore,I updated recently and seems like there were two more updates back to back right after but since then every single time I launch the app it makes me log in again. It‚Äôs becoming really annoying. I really like this app and have been using it for quite some time now but I‚Äôm not sure how much more I can take of the persistent login screen. Hopefully this is just some sort of bug or was just overlooked by a developer and that they will find it soon and fix it. üòâ
105,105,5,2020-06-18T10:23:39.000Z,spook511,Great app,"As a professional cook, I love this app.  It lets me find, compare and plan dishes.   Easy to use, and find some recipes I wouldn‚Äôt have known to search for.  One thing I will say, is the ‚ÄúPRO‚Äù version seems a bit high priced at $5/m($60/year?).  Cooking is a catch 22... either you love food, so cooking is part of you, and you learn along the way.... or you don‚Äôt cook good often... so why pay for an app?   I would probably pay $1.99/mo($24/yr) to watch an educational video occasionally.  Just my $.02.   Like I said, free version is already great.   Paying just seems like a wast to many people.  Thanks YUMMLY!"
106,106,5,2020-05-13T15:02:29.000Z,Awesome game I love it roar,So helpful,Ever since using this app meal prep and planning has gotten so much easier. Not only can you find amazing recipes (and trust me there‚Äôs alot) but you can add them to a shopping list with one click and have it all organized for you. I was hesitant to use this app as I figured you would have to pay to make it good but that‚Äôs not the case. Paying only unlocks a few special recipes and features so you don‚Äôt it for the app to work. I‚Äôve tried so many recipe apps but I deleted all of them once I got Yummly. Also organizing recipes becomes so easy with this app as well
107,107,5,2020-07-12T12:57:00.000Z,roshawn74,Reignited my love for food,"Yummly has been one of the best apps I‚Äôve downloaded. It works flawlessly and updates frequently. Whether I have a few ingredients and I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to make, or I‚Äôm looking for something specific, Yummly has been there for me. I used to love cooking a few items. That got old and boring. Now, I enjoy cooking everything, and my family will eat my cooking now too! üôÉ One of the best features has been the grocery list. I plan out a week of meals and go through the list to see what we need to get from the store. It‚Äôs so convenient!"
108,108,4,2020-07-03T01:58:09.000Z,jlabourr,Pretty Good App,"I‚Äôm usually fairly pleased with Yummly. The two reasons I give it 4 stars are: (1) sometimes the variety of recipes is limited and I find better options simply by googling my ingredients; and (2) it is a hassle to habe the ingredients page separate from the directions page. Many of the directions pages do not have the ingredients on them or do not have the measurements for the ingredients on them and you cannot switch back and forth between the ingredients and directions pages within the app without losing your place. Otherwise, the app looks great, is user friendly, and I use it often."
109,109,4,2019-10-12T17:48:41.000Z,im1withthe4s,Yummly‚Äôs must try,Yummly is very interesting. It is very interesting to see the types of recipes and ideas that people have come up with. Love the many many options including vegetarian vegan and recipes for people with allergies. Love that you can add or subtract things from a meal when using the grocery list section of the app. Love it that you can adapt the recipe based upon how many servings you are intending on. Love the pictures many of which make me hungry already. On the downside the ads can be a little disrupting when trying to get the recipe. A warning for blind people not the most blind friendly app can be a little screwy with screen readers.
110,110,5,2018-09-08T01:50:08.000Z,My_Kids_Make_Me_Wine,Help! It Stopped!!,"I love Yummly. It's my go to app for all things food. But recently, it's stopped working. Like, nothing opens at all. I click my app icon and all I see are brownies in the background, a gray circle with ""you"" in it, and six dots at the top that appear to represent pages.  I can't scroll up or down. I can't scroll side to side. I tried to uninstall and reinstall a few times and always the same thing."

The recipes are easy to organize, easy to follow, I can easily make simple adaptations if needed and I am having fun cooking again. I love the feature to add the ingredients to a shopping list, I feel happy to be back in my kitchen and having everyone asking ""what's that smell?"" & ""can I have that too"" thank you for this app. Happy Mom & Wife."
112,112,5,2019-02-04T04:31:28.000Z,Aliusia,The one app everybody needs,This app has helped me so much because I meal prep and like having a variety of options with only a few ingredients tailored to our tastes. Yummly has done all that for me in just a few min setting up my profile. What took me 10 min of my time would have taken me hours in google searches and I get emails with new ideas. Thank you so much for taking the stress out of finding great recipes so I can get back to the fun of cooking! And I love being able to give back by leaving reviews and photos so others can feel confident trying a new recipe.
113,113,5,2019-03-12T03:18:12.000Z,Jacobshaner,Fantastic!,"This is the greatest recipe and cooking app I have found yet! I have found so many recipes easily categorized. I can use the search to find a recipe and once I found it if I choose I can push a button and all of the ingredients will be added to my shopping list. There‚Äôs even a function that will put a recipe that I‚Äôm planning to make on my calendar and send me alerts as to when to begin prepping it, when to cook it and when to check on it. This app is so personable and easy to use and I recommend it highly to anyone- beginner or expert-who likes to cook."

So many recipes with easy instructions and great way to add to grocery list for when we go to the store. The only two features I would like to see is the ability to edit and print the recipes once we save straight from the appt but this is not a huge deal; and maybe adding sales adds for major stores so we can pick recipes based on what's on sale. Anyway, love it and have been using it weekly- such a huge help."

It allows you to add the ingredients needed from the recipe of your choice, to a grocery list which is convenient and you can easily check off. You rate the recipe and write your own review and even follow people if you like their recipes. This app is well-organized and convenient, but mostly resourceful since it also suggests some kitchen instruments to help you with the recipe. I recommend 100%!"
116,116,4,2019-10-19T00:21:13.000Z,Ishkabishka,Easy to use,"Love this app. I have used it a lot in the past 2 years and my husband loves that my meals have become more varied. Definitely makes it easier to try new things! The shopping list has always been my favorite feature, but I‚Äôm not a fan of how the new shopping list looks and works since the most recent app update. Doesn‚Äôt seem quite as visually ‚Äúeasy‚Äù and I‚Äôve had items or whole recipe ingredient lists disappear from my shopping list and I can‚Äôt figure out how to get them back without adding the whole recipe back in which is a pain when you are in the middle of a shopping trip."

It is like EHarmony for cooking. Just not enough time to try all the recipes! You can also customize folders to save the recipes to."

120,120,5,2018-07-27T15:45:00.000Z,HikerMomma4,Great App!,My wife and I are so pleased with this app. Before we were just eating the same old stuff every week and it was getting old but now that we use Yummly I feel like we can eat a wide variety of foods every week and it never gets old. We like how you can see how many ingredients are in each recipe so you can choose ones that don‚Äôt have a lot of ingredients. We yum the recipes we like and it saves them to our favorites and we make our grocery lists based on the ingredients. It makes meal planning easy and more proficient. We absolutely love it!
121,121,5,2018-09-27T01:36:46.000Z,SandroSan,Amazing App and Amazing Team,"I love to cook new things and can never think of a menu for the week. This app lets me pick from so many recipients while filtering out allergies, dietary restrictions, and even customized personal taste! Once you find the recipe you can add it to your calendar and if you don‚Äôt have the ingredients add them to your shopping cart."
122,122,5,2019-03-27T03:58:03.000Z,XxSmellyCatxX,Very considerate,They ask you questions about what you want first then bring you to the homepage and they find stuff related to what you liked on the homepage like instagram or Pinterest. Then when you search up something like cake they ask you if you want an ingredient left out or time and dietary preferences to limit it to what you might like. Now it isn‚Äôt all perfect ‚Äòcause no app is but I definitely love this app and how organized. They also let you change your dietary preference if you need to. Thank you so much Yummly for this free app to help me out.

I love the ease of adding ingredients to my shopping list and then having those items listed by department makes grocery shopping a breeze. If I find or am given a recipe from another source like Pinterest I search for it on Yummly and usually find it, so I can keep all of my recipes in one place. The Home page recommendations are great, the more you Yum, the better the suggestions are to fit your personal tastes and cooking style. Love this app!"

As someone who doesn‚Äôt know much about flavours, it‚Äôs wonderful to have recipes from around the world with detailed instructions at the tip of your fingertips. The explore feature is a great way to get ideas of things you didn‚Äôt even know existed, and in my experience they‚Äôve generally turned out quite well."

So I checked my iOS and that too was updated. So I called the 800 number and after being on hold for 5 minutes they told me that they couldn‚Äôt help me over the phone and that I had to email tech support. I asked them aren‚Äôt you tech support and they said yes but for my situation I have to email them. So I emailed them and after waiting a day for a response they had me troubleshoot the same procedure that‚Äôs on the app and to email them back if that didn‚Äôt work. So guess what IT DIDNT WORK!! So I emailed them back to tell them that it didn‚Äôt work and still to this day I have not got a response back. Very disappointed.

As a somewhat novice cook, I loved how I was able to create an order directly through Instacart. I love love that the recipes can be changed for number of servings.

My favorite part though is that you can add all ingredients to a shopping list, remove the things you don‚Äôt need to buy, and send the list to Walmart/target/other partner stores and order the groceries in one click! I can plan my whole week and grocery shop from my phone or computer. It really makes me excited to plan my week!"

You can pick what ingredients you need and it makes you a shopping list and will even tell you where you can find it cheapest. In addition, you tell them when your meal needs to be done and it‚Äôll send you an alarm to get started."

I use the shopping list when I'm at the grocery store and mark it as bought when I add it to my cart so that I don't have to stop and scroll :') I was, however, wondering if it might at all be possible to add a reminder to throw out fresh produce when it's likely about gone bad! (I suppose I could do this myself as well but again, new to the cooking thing)"
133,133,5,2020-12-09T15:22:19.000Z,Glb481,Yummly recipes,"Yummly has a variety of recipes for each recipe title. For example, there are several recipes for something as simple as a bacon-wrapped filet mignon. I reviewed all of them to see if I could learn from them and pick up any hints. I followed one of them and the filets came out perfectly."
134,134,5,2020-07-12T01:00:23.000Z,Cactuszinnia,Spinning wheels after update,Update: I received a timely and kind response and was able to fix the problem by deleting and reloading the app as recommended. So happy that I‚Äôm able to access the app as designed. Thank you so much!!
135,135,4,2020-10-25T12:05:52.000Z,Cook Aria,Helpful App,Yummly is a very helpful app when you‚Äôre looking for recipes based on what you already have in your fridge and pantry. Most recipes have tips on cooking variations and substitutions and comments from others that have made the recipe before and photos. I‚Äôm able to save the recipes in categories to remake later. I don‚Äôt like all the pop-up ads that block the recipe and occasionally recipes are no longer available. Then there‚Äôs a fee for guided (video) recipes if you want to go Pro Yummly. Other than these 2 annoying issues I really like this app and have used it for years.
136,136,5,2020-05-09T17:11:40.000Z,Cadcmmngs,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP,"I used to use the paid app, emeals, however once I found the Yummly app, I cancelled my other membership."
137,137,5,2020-04-20T19:37:32.000Z,Sam Werts,Accommodating to food allergies,"I have several severe food allergies (milk, eggs, all nuts and shellfish) that make finding recipes extremely difficult. Yumly allowed me to put in my food allergies to find things I can eat. Before this app I was stuck with vegan cooking apps that had ingredients I had never heard of plus really complicated recipes, yumly has instructions that are easy to follow plus ingredients that you probably already have. I usually never write reviews but if you have food allergies this will change your diet for the better!"
138,138,5,2019-08-04T16:07:58.000Z,NoxFyr,Loves to cook,"Cooking has been my second favorite hobby (after eating) for almost 47 years. A coworker turned me on to Yummly several years ago, and it quickly became one of my most used applications. Sometimes, I use this for ideas, sometimes I need recipes, sometimes I‚Äôm just reading for entertainment. The ability to just look up recipes ranging from simple to complex is great. The ability to filter on ingredients is even better. I‚Äôve been using this at least 8 years and plan on using it for many more years."
139,139,4,2021-02-16T11:41:02.000Z,Dockterrr,So close to the perfect food app!,"I am very impressed with so many features on this app. I love being able to choose my dietary plan, and watch as the app only filters out those recipes  I‚Äôm allowed to have, then add it to a meal calendar, which syncs to all my devices, and then how it puts together a shopping list is genius. My only complaint is that I would love to be able to import the info into other apps (for weight tracking), or if there were a premium feature that allowed me to set health goals, and import the food data (macros and such) into my daily limit."
140,140,2,2017-11-18T22:19:33.000Z,SUNsHiNE (:,Was great before...,"Used to love this, but it‚Äôs becoming a pain to use and harder to find recipes. I find myself going to Pinterest because this just doesn‚Äôt do it for me. If i don‚Äôt search something exactly like it wants me to or mess with filters a million time, it usually ends saying there are ‚Äòno results‚Äô. I feel that I need to come here knowing exactly what I want to make, rather than finding suggestions based on ingredients, because if I‚Äôm not specific I get something very, very basic. Also finding recipes using the ingredients on hand feature would be great if it didn‚Äôt search recipes that ONLY have those ingredients and included recipes that might be missing one or two on the list..."
141,141,5,2018-05-06T20:33:33.000Z,SavLeeB,Wow,"This app is truly amazing. I never rate anything, ever, but I had to with this one. Grocery shopping, buying the correct ingredients, making shopping lists, even figuring out what you want to make in the first place, this app does ALL of it. Everything I just mentioned gives me extreme anxiety, so much so that I rarely grocery shop anymore. This app has simplified the process and makes t easier to eat well too! I have already recommended this to friends because of how much i dig it. And it‚Äôs free! Do yourself a favor and get this app ASAP!"
142,142,4,2019-06-09T08:08:05.000Z,Aanneeeeeeee,Best and worst- videos have no cc nor ingredients,"This is the most amazing app w an incredible filter system for likes, allergies, dinner bfast drinks desserts, add foods you dislike, scroll, watch videos, and more I havent even learned yet. However!!  The videos dont have cc so I have no idea what theyre adding bc hey dont even post a line or show recipe ingredients!!  Reallllllllllllly needs to be amended for those who are not able to hear. If you fixed that then 5üå†. But for this day and age you need closed caption, or words showing what is happening, what ingredients are added, what to do, how long to wait, rest, cook, knead, etc."
143,143,5,2021-01-11T03:35:28.000Z,carizep,Great app for finding a recipe for anything!,I have really enjoyed using this app! I will just get a thought in my head of something I might want to try to make and all I have to do is type in what it is and hundreds of recipes will pop up. I find that it is convenient that it shows you right up front how many ingredients are in the recipe so I can know which ones are a little bit easier to make. I also appreciate that they post pictures of each dish so I have an idea of what it looks like.
144,144,5,2020-05-02T15:51:27.000Z,Pkgtyv,"Love it, use it all the time",I can filter for vegetarian which I love. Can easily save recipes in pre-made categories or my own. I've found tons of great recipes on here and lots left still to try. I want to add some of my ownüíú The only annoying thing is when going back out of a recipe collection to the ‚Äúmy Yums‚Äù it automatically goes back to the beginning and it can take awhile to scroll back to where you left off. I recommend immediately categorizing your recipes into a collection for this reason.
145,145,5,2020-01-10T21:58:42.000Z,DaneaStar,Awesome recipe app!,"Only had it a few days but this is my FAVORITE recipe app! Some recipes are only available with a paid upgrade ( which I plan to get soon) but there are tons of great recipes available on this free version. I love that you can choose special diets as I am focusing on keto or low carb now. You can also search recipes based on ingredients you have on hand by simply snapping a pic of your ingredients! You can save recipes you like in categories, such as ‚Äúbreakfast‚Äù or ‚Äúdrinks‚Äù, and create your own custom categories! Trust me, you need this app!"
146,146,5,2020-11-12T16:59:56.000Z,Inkedcookiess,Perfect for my 1/2 & 1/2 family üòÇ,I have been using the app for more than two years now. Just a few months ago my son change his diet to vegetarian for health reasons. I love that I can organize my recipes on there own folder.
147,147,5,2021-03-01T21:29:00.000Z,player54681,It‚Äôs the best...Honest!,"Okay, here‚Äôs there deal, I‚Äôm a great cook, I have a recipe for just about everything I‚Äôve ever eaten, and I‚Äôm also gluten free. If this app had bad recipes, I‚Äôd delete it. It doesn‚Äôt. (At least not that I‚Äôve found) It‚Äôs basically Google for recipes. You simply look for a recipe and it has thousands complied from different websites in one app. No adds, No required subscriptions, just straight up good food. Whatever level you are, whatever diet you follow, and whatever food you enjoy, try this app. You won‚Äôt regret it!"
148,148,4,2019-12-30T02:50:34.000Z,Gibbtribb,I use it often but could use some upgrades,"I switched over from Epicurious over a year ago because their app was always down.  Yummly is good, doesn‚Äôt have as many good recipes as Epicurious, I had over one thousand saved but the app always works.  Some suggestions would be instead of just ‚Äúyumm‚Äù a recipe to be able to put it right in your recipe box category like dinner or breakfast would be best for organization.  Also changing the home page daily of suggested recipes and or emailing recipes highlighting a theme or topic will draw ppl back to the app to save recipes."
149,149,5,2020-06-10T18:05:41.000Z,Itofiuugsyotdhucgjlxfzi,Yum,"I absolutely love this app. I appreciate that you can select dietary requirements as well as request not to been shown any recipes that contain certain ingredients. I enjoy the grocery list option, I wish it could transfer over to the grocery order online and I have tried to schedule meals but there always seems to be an error. Also I wish when you saved a recipe it would categorize it for you or at least ask what folder you would like it in. Other than that great app"
150,150,5,2018-10-30T23:32:04.000Z,byRabbitAndCrab,Best,"Best app I can find. I‚Äôm detail oriented and schedule obsessive. I tell my friends, family, and their friends to download this app. The filters on here make my life better (allergies, diet trends, preferences, cuisines, etc, etc). The calendar abilities make my world better. This app takes everything overwhelming about self-care through meals and does it for me. The minute groceries start delivering to ‚Äúmy area‚Äù half of my entire enterprise as an adult human will be complete. This app encourages me to reach for better, lends hope that I can become better."
151,151,4,2018-11-05T00:51:58.000Z,DramaLlama224,Super helpful app,"I love this app, it‚Äôs a great way to get recipes. I like that you can search by ingredients and specify any dietary restrictions or preferences. I also find the shopping list feature very useful for recipes with a lot of ingredients."
152,152,4,2019-05-20T16:56:29.000Z,nfelicem1,Great!,"There are many times, especially lately, but I found myself freaking out because I did not have any ideas! I‚Äôm able to use this app and go online and check out some of the different recipes which have been great. I just used a Tuscan shrimp recipe that my family really liked. There are a ton of recipes, it‚Äôs easy to use and I‚Äôm able to then print them out and put them in my recipe book for later! Even having the list of ingredients and directions and then being able to also print out the recipe is very helpful. Thanks!"
153,153,5,2020-03-21T16:13:58.000Z,mixologist wannabe,Love you Yummly,My Yummly app is my go-to!  We have a cabin we go to every weekend and having recipes handy at both homes is almost impossible but Yummly makes it easy!  I always have my phone with me.  Having a list of ingredients at my fingertips is a huge plus at the grocery store. And I have found tons of recipes that are fabulous- and I‚Äôm picky!  Just now I googled recipes using Mango Patron and found a sight with 10 to choose from. Went to click and what do you know - Yummly site!  Now you know why I live Yummly!  You will too!
154,154,4,2020-05-20T16:07:22.000Z,Got2Live,Easy to use but difficult selection process,"Easy to use and good recipients. My only negative is that there are too many recipes that show up in the search results and often times some are similar, so it ends up being g more of a pain to select a recipe because I have to select each one, which takes me to another site."
155,155,5,2020-12-25T20:24:09.000Z,Aniroc_s,Life saver,"I love to cook and now during the pandemic this app saved my sanity. My family and I are lucky for not having to eat the same thing every day. Lots of amazing dishes, easy to follow recipes, easy to navigate and an option to save your favorites, for a repeat meal. I love the fact that I‚Äôm able to see multiple recipes for the same thing and take ingredients from each to create my own version of deliciousness."
156,156,5,2020-06-07T00:12:24.000Z,Bell skater,Wide variety of recipes,There are a ton of recipes in this app and we have really enjoyed the majority that we have tried (been using this app for over 5 years).
157,157,4,2020-03-20T15:44:10.000Z,Ally's beauty,Much better than Allrecipes,This app is great. It has vivid precise photos of each recipe. The recipes can be shown by ingredient. I like the shopping list feature however the cart function is cumbersome. It picks the item for your cart but doesn‚Äôt provide many options when you try to change to a brand you like or a lower priced brand. I was spending $300 for groceries when I would never choose those high priced options. Otherwise it‚Äôs pretty good. Yummly app has a lot of glitches that make you have to restart the app frequently very frustrating
158,158,4,2019-10-30T21:54:38.000Z,Notthemoma,Best until Update,"Update: This app is once again the best recipe app. I use it several times a week. This is my go to on Sundays especially when my daughter and I decide what to make. I love I can add the recipes to my meal planner calendar and shopping list app. I‚Äôm really happy with the update and it it works with my iPadOS 13, at first I had problems but not anymore. I‚Äôve upped my stars to 5 stars. Thanks for that !"
159,159,4,2021-02-19T22:14:34.000Z,lmthay,Great until now,"Previously I would have rated Yummly 5 stars- it‚Äôs free and has countless fantastic recipes in a really easy to use app. Unfortunately, with this new update it lost the feature for me to schedule meals and add them to my calendar app; being replaced by the new ‚Äúmeal plan‚Äù option that must be paid for and is not even available in my region. I don‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôve gone and made that a paid charge, I just want to be able to schedule my meals again. It‚Äôs actually become less convenient now than it was when I first got the app."

This app has made it very easy for me to find recipes that are different than the usual stuff and I can cater to whatever eating pattern my kid decides he wants to try. To be honest, I am the same way though, I get on kicks where I want to eat a certain way for awhile and Yummly helps tremendously. I LOVE the shopping list feature. I know I am enjoying an app when I start telling all my fitness friends about it!"
161,161,4,2019-04-14T23:50:13.000Z,Run CmF,"Really good, sometimes outdated","This app is really useful for finding a recipe if you want to use a certain technique, use a certain ingredient, have a craving for something specific, or are just looking for cooking inspiration. The only downside is that it uses third party websites and blogs so if the third party deletes the recipe or blog post you can‚Äôt see the instructions on the app. Unfortunately while it doesn‚Äôt happen on every single recipe that I find enticing it has happened multiple times and doesn‚Äôt seem to be something that the app developers have noticed."

163,163,4,2020-07-24T18:03:05.000Z,amandabby00,This app is great but..,I love using this app. It‚Äôs where I find my recipes to cook dinner! I just updated the app today and it seems like it hasn‚Äôt fixed anything. The last few weeks I‚Äôll be looking at a recipe I love and then the app will freeze and then close itself. So it‚Äôs so frustrating liking something and then the app closes and can‚Äôt find it again.. It‚Äôs also really glitchy and slow? When scrolling it lags. It wasn‚Äôt like this when I first downloaded it about 8-9 months ago. So yeah love the app tremendously but something needs to be fixed
164,164,4,2020-05-20T23:19:02.000Z,Searching for fun,Measures up...,"About a year ago I wanted to find an app that consolidated my eating needs & wants.  Still in my infancy of practicing cooking I neglected the site and just recently re‚Äùdiscovered‚Äù what a phenomenal site/app Yummly is.  The diverse tools: selecting diet type, eliminating unwanted foods/spices, curating a grocery list direct from the recipes selected, building a recipe book and NOW the  grocery list comparison tool for shopping at local grocers is a win for me.  MIND.  BLOWN!"
165,165,2,2021-05-12T18:28:35.000Z,Jhutch13,Glitchy,"I‚Äôve used and loved this app for years, but the last couple months have been frustrating. When searching through my Yummed recipes it will show a few lines of recipes but when you scroll to see more recipes, the page will go blank. Forcing me to go back and try again, hoping that I‚Äôm fast enough to see more recipes before it glitches again. Also‚Ä¶ When I want to pull up the shopping list it always starts off Plan, which is a Pro service and seems to be trying to get you to pay for Pro. Just let me use the shopping list. If I want to pay fro pro I would‚Äôve, but pro is useless to me. Besides all that‚Ä¶ love the app! Deuces!"
166,166,5,2020-12-05T06:01:42.000Z,KateK8,This app taught me to cook!,"During the 2020 Covid quarantines, I desperately sought a new pastime.  I‚Äôve never been much of a cook in the past, but I decided to try to improve my skills.  This app gave me seemingly endless recipes, from all over the world.  I have had a blast trying new things, and have become quite bold in my culinary adventures!  Most are successes, a few have been failures, of course, but there are limitless cooking opportunities available on Yummly that have really changed how I think about food.  It‚Äôs my favorite app!"
167,167,5,2020-11-26T23:46:08.000Z,Dafienka,Great App,"I‚Äôve been using Yummly for years , even before they even had an app. ( It‚Äôs been that long) Anyhow, so many recipes to chose from. T love how you can save recipes into diff categories. The only thing I‚Äôve noticed lately is when in search within my recipes rather than scroll through every single one nothing comes up when I know that recipe exists or something that is NOT in my saved recipes randomly comes up. It‚Äôs quite annoying. Pls fix bc it was fine before"
168,168,5,2020-04-05T23:00:10.000Z,YM236,Longtime user,I‚Äôve found and stored so many great recipes on Yummly. I love the way I can add ingredients easily to a shopping list and can filter my search results. I respect that it respects the original blog poster but sometimes it‚Äôs a bit of an effort to get to the actual recipe. Also wish you could rearrange the order and automatic sorting of the shopping list (for instance I enter my grocery store at the produce section so it‚Äôd be great if I could put items on my list in the order I know I‚Äôm going to encounter them in my store).
169,169,3,2019-12-24T21:58:15.000Z,Mkm5r,"Great recipes, annoying pop-ups","This is an awesome discovery tool for new recipes and even different takes on things I make all the time. You can find everything from appetizers to deserts and at least three variations of each dish from other end users or professional chefs. The variety is awesome and the UI is easy to use, which makes the experience even better. The one thing that drives me crazy are the CONSTANT pop-ups to rate the app and enable notifications. I‚Äôve said I don‚Äôt want push notifications on once, and that should be the end of the conversation. Stop asking me every time I open the app."
170,170,5,2017-12-07T16:28:22.000Z,Perplexity Samson,Great!,I love Yummly. I‚Äôve been using it for a few years and I have discovered so many new recipes. The best part is the scheduling so you know when to start prepping.
171,171,4,2018-10-17T13:22:40.000Z,artoodeee2,Switched from recipe keeper,Can‚Äôt believe I just now found this app! Such a clean look and feel. You can add meals right into your calendar and it sends a reminder to start prepping so dinner will be done at the time you choose. Love the ability to add to the shopping list right from the recipe. Another great feature is being able to print/share your shopping list.
172,172,5,2019-02-14T01:44:47.000Z,FitinOrtonville,Awesome,"I can truly say that I have liked every recipe I have made so far.  I love the ability to tailor the selections to my preferences ( healthy eating) and this app can filter out common food allergens.  I like the shopping list feature, you can create a list of foods needed for your recipes but can also add other items, not needed for your recipes, to the list.  The shopping list also classifies your items by type; dairy, meats, etc. to make it easier to shop.  I highly recommend this app."
173,173,5,2019-03-13T03:15:42.000Z,from my family thank you,Best app I‚Äôve ever downloaded ever,I usually don‚Äôt write reviews but I have to take the time to write this review this is the best app ever downloaded When I transition to become pescatarian I had a very hard time with figuring out recipes to cook if it were not because of this app I would have never been successful at it I sincerely appreciate whoever took the time to create this magnificent o app!!! I have shared it with so many of my friends and they feel the same way thank you so much again for changing my life!!!

I love the selection of cuisines, dietary choices, directional videos, etc. I love that I can choose how many servings I‚Äôm making and how the ingredients adjust to those servings.i love that it shows nutritional values and reviews.  This recipe app has always been by favorite. It never gets old and even though I check out other recipe sites, you can‚Äôt beat this one. Love it!"

Because of covid I have been home while my girlfriend is at work so every day I look up a new recipe and go down to the grocery store for the ingredients I need and cook it for her when she gets home and they have turned out so good! I am amazed that I can make those things by following the directions on the app."

All I do is type in a specific ingredient and or produce that I have, and search for whatever receipts pop up and our family is in the mood for that night. It's so easy !! They have a variety of very healthy versions and other traditional and classic versions of of many variations of recipes. Everything is right where I need it. Great App and always recommend !!"

178,178,3,2020-10-24T14:07:59.000Z,JD dhhdhxhxdhsj,Why change it?,I have been using this app for years and absolutely love it until recently.  When I search for something there are no pictures!  I‚Äôm a visual cooker and this change is terrible for me.  I see pictures if I go to my saved recipes and if I brows through the suggestions but when I search for something specific there aren‚Äôt any and it asks me a million questions before giving me a suggestion. I loved this app for its ease of use and quick suggestions not happening anymore. Very frustrating and this has caused me to not use it as frequently.  Disappointed.

I love that Yummly will create my shopping list, it will increase the quantum of servings and I can save the recipe and shopping list to my phone for easy access while grocery shopping!!!!"
180,180,4,2019-02-16T21:14:10.000Z,Justine H:),Awesome! One thing to add...,"I love how this app, unlike other recipe apps, asks you for allergies, diets, and all about what you eat instead of just giving you random recipes. Everything looks so good and yummy. The one thing I would like for it to have is a choice in the beginning for pollotarians. There is a question that asks what are you? Vegan, Vegetarian, Ovo Vegetarian, Keto, and such. I‚Äôm a pollotarian, which means I don‚Äôt eat red meat, but can eat everything else like dairy, eggs, chicken, fish, etc. I just can‚Äôt eat pork, beef, and other red meats. I home the creator of this app adds this feature. Thank you!"
181,181,2,2019-03-18T03:42:24.000Z,Ramezsand,Almost Useless...,"Recently, I was getting more interested in making food for my family (I‚Äôm 13), and I came across Yummly. I was immediately greeted by a pleasant design and a smooth interface. However, when I found a recipe I wanted to read, I got an ‚ÄúAccess Restricted‚Äù page instead. My mother restricted all websites because she doesn‚Äôt want me to browse the internet, and Yummly only uses the website that the recipes come from, thus, Yummly was useless. I‚Äôd easily make this a 5 star review if the developers can find a way to import the recipes to the app, rather than relying on the source website. I don‚Äôt mind too much, so I won‚Äôt bother you any longer, and have a great day."

My sister recommended Yummly, and I‚Äôm so glad I listened to her advice! I was able to indicate my preferences for gluten free, and the app has never shown me a recipe that isn‚Äôt able to become compliant. SO REFRESHING!"
183,183,5,2020-04-08T01:47:51.000Z,Shell Cardone,Great and easy recipes,"I‚Äôve been using Yummly for a few years.  I love how I can search just recipes with chicken or with ground meet or whatever I‚Äôm craving.  I can search for healthy options and I can search for healthy and easy.  It‚Äôs so simple to use.  Some nights I don‚Äôt feel like cooking so I search for crockpot recipes.  Just about everything I‚Äôve tried has been fantastic from soups to appetizers, dinners to desserts.  I recommend this app to family and friends all the time.  Thank you Yummly!"
184,184,5,2021-02-12T19:14:16.000Z,K C Raven,Need help,"My Yummly app was working fine and the update popped up. I had time so I updated the app with latest version and now my Yummly won‚Äôt even load. I click the app on my iPhone 7plus and I get to see a lemon and a lime on a wood board then it goes back to my main screen on my phone ‚òπÔ∏è I am worried if I delete the app I will lose so many awesome recipes that has taken yrs to save. I am at a loss, I really don‚Äôt know what to do üßê I love Yummly and I wish I would have never went to the latest version!!!!"
185,185,2,2020-02-15T02:06:31.000Z,snackboy85,Redundant and pointless,"Why is it that I need to get the app to read the recipes and directions when I am on the web browser, but when I use the app some of the directions for some dishes just re-direct me back to the web browser. Its a terrible experience because then I get autoplay videos and ads that cant be blocked. This slows down the experience and makes it harder to follow on that crappy browser we are put through. Terrible user experience whenever I need to be redirected to the web. Either let us use the web version without having to use the app, or have ALL the directions and recipes accessible natively in the app."
186,186,5,2021-01-22T18:41:54.000Z,Gracie410252,Love this app,"I use this app regularly and find it helpful to feed multiple children with varied eating (one gluten free, one vegetarian, one 13 year old foodie).  I quickly find recipes to meet the needs of all and based on what I have in my pantry.  Has been great during Covid-19 with college students at home and cooking for more people.  I usually add additional spices and vegetables to recipes to suit our tastes and always start out my search with words ‚Äòeasy or quick‚Äô, knowing I can add to it if I want!"
187,187,5,2020-08-31T02:29:26.000Z,Amc82078,My go-to cooking app,"Love, love, love!  I use this frequently!  I usually have an idea of what I want to do, but will check to see if the ingredients I have on hand will work, based on recipes I find on Yummly.  (I'm tweaking things and not always using the recipes as they are written.). I don't require strict guidelines for searching and organizing what I find, so I've been really pleased (but please note, that I have been able to organize recipes that I have wanted to reference again, very easily on the app)!"
188,188,3,2020-04-07T22:40:20.000Z,Mariba33,System is slower - update,I was using Yummly regularly and had all my favs in my Yum list... with the upgrade... I lost them all. Thanks for that!
189,189,1,2021-06-16T23:51:44.000Z,terrible_reviews,its an amazing app BUT‚Ä¶,"I love Yummly, and would‚Äôve easily rated it 5 stars, but this latest update is just terrible. The UI changes are great, but so much now is locked behind a subscription. Many people use the app for free as it‚Äôs the best free recipes app there is. But putting things behind paywalls can drastically reduce the number of people who use this app. Nutrition information should not be locked behind a subscription. i‚Äôm perfectly fine and agreeable with having certain recipes (i.e. pro recipes) behind a subscription, but nutrition information is crossing a line."
190,190,5,2018-03-19T13:04:02.000Z,rainyreader,My Go To!!,"Yummly is one of my favorite apps and I‚Äôve been using it for several years. I love it!!! I‚Äôve recommended it to many and actually ditched the last of cookbooks when I started using this. I love the variety of recipes available but then there are other features like the shopping list, and changing the portion size. The most fabulous feature is putting in some ingredients you have (not knowing what to do with them) and it generates recipes with those ingredients."
191,191,4,2019-01-26T04:10:28.000Z,Pxel9,Good variety,"The app has a lot of recipes so far (I‚Äôve only been using it about 2 weeks). Some are great, some are so-so, but that‚Äôs to be expected with crowdsourced recipes."
192,192,5,2019-04-29T16:50:22.000Z,Cokymona,Good recipes,"It‚Äôs a good app what I like about it, is that it is very detailed on the recipes and reasonable at times. The measure are for the most part accurate just recommend to read the recipe before actually attempting it   I have not had anything to complain so far and it even has a vegetarian option so it won‚Äôt give you recipes with meat, as well as vegan dishes. Just keep in mind while reading the recipes it will say the tools you need just make sure you have them."
193,193,5,2020-12-28T23:22:15.000Z,M. Monro,Marci M.,I use this app every single week without fail! I can‚Äôt think of one recipe my family hasn‚Äôt loved. This app is helpful in so many ways whether it‚Äôs to look up a specific recipe or to get a long list of ideas just by giving the ingredients I have on hand. If I had to pick one thing that I would change it would be to remove the long drawn out stories you have to read just to get to the ingredients or directions on some of the recipes.
194,194,5,2020-01-02T02:01:29.000Z,SheaL#1,Love this app!,What I love: every recipe has a picture!!; app combs the internet for recipes so you have tons of variations of a dish to choose from; you can save your favorite recipes and organize them in folders if you want; you can see reviews from others who‚Äôve made the recipe and often get great tips in those reviews; easy search feature so I can always find what I‚Äôm looking for; my fav all time find: raw cookie dough for pregnancy! I still make it even though my youngest is 9!!
195,195,5,2020-07-04T22:27:01.000Z,Demian68,Amazing cooking app,"This app is crazy good. The free version is probably the best free app of any kind I‚Äôve ever seen. Haven‚Äôt signed up for the subscription but most likely I will. The app is basically an aggregator of recipes you could google search for but having everything categorized and at your finger tips is awesome, plus of course you can save favorite recipes by category. The photos are great and the interface is super slick and easy to navigate. Check it out if you love to cook. Kudos to the developers!"
196,196,3,2019-07-25T02:03:09.000Z,chef T Dad,"Not fed enough variety, cumbersome navigation","Yummly is my go-to for recipes. Love the visual representation and the scroll down main screen. I would like to see more variety in my suggested recipes, though. I picked a lot of different food interests during set up, but I feel like Yummly bombards me with multiple recipes of a very similar (or same) kind, and focuses on what I‚Äôve ‚Äúyummed‚Äù recently. There could definitely be more variety presented. Also, I find it somewhat cumbersome to navigate through the menu items - doesn‚Äôt feel intuitive enough. Don‚Äôt lose heart, though, you‚Äôve got a good thing goingüòä"
197,197,4,2019-07-23T13:34:08.000Z,DomesticGoddess18,Great Recipe App,"The only reason this app isn‚Äôt 5 stars is because the you have to exit the app to get directions for the recipes.. I‚Äôve noticed some recipes have begun to have the directions directly within the app, which is amazing. It gets frustrating having to exit the app every time I make something.. The app‚Äôs benefits are you can save recipes to make again, it makes recommendations based on what you‚Äôve made in the past and you can specialize what you‚Äôre looking for (chicken entree, broccoli side, appetizers, etc.) all in one app."
198,198,4,2019-06-26T14:42:06.000Z,Earthlysnarf,"Great recipes, but too many pop-up ads :(","We love the recipes we‚Äôve found on Yummly!  However it‚Äôs often difficult to read the directions because there are so many pop-up ads.  When working on a phone, the ads take up almost the entire screen and are difficult to remove; the close buttons are so small, you inadvertently end up opening the advertisement, usually while in the middle of cooking!  So it can be frustrating.  I would have given 5 stars but for all the ads."
199,199,5,2020-08-12T00:21:38.000Z,Cattp01,Great recipes,"I love using Yummly when I need a good recipe to make for my family. I gave it 5 stars because, there has not been a time when I was unable to find a recipe that I was looking to make. I love the fact that there are the same recipes by so many different people, that make their recipe a little different from others. Yummly is my go to recipe site. My family loves when I make a variety of different things for them to try, and I have Yummly to thank for that."
200,200,5,2018-10-29T22:48:23.000Z,Tlwash,Better than a cookbook,I love the recipes. There‚Äôs always a variety of ways to prepare a dish whether you want it to be quick and easy or want to spend time with a more detailed version. Often times I just pick a category or a major ingredient and start thumbing through recipes. I‚Äôm never disappointed and always find something to prepare. I recommend Yummly a lot. When I find a great recipe I often will forward it to one of my cooking friends as well.
201,201,5,2019-03-29T23:13:28.000Z,Rater skater,One of my favorite apps of all time,"Yummly connects me with so many recipes from so many different sources. One of the things I now look forward to during the week is getting Yummly emails with recommendations. As a college student, I‚Äôm always on the go, however I‚Äôve found so much comfort and happiness in setting aside time for myself and preparing a lovely meal whether that be quick and easy 5 minute tacos or a creamy risotto. And Yummly make it SO easy....it‚Äôs almost too good to be true. Almost üòÅ"
202,202,5,2020-12-23T22:16:54.000Z,debrakp,My favorite cooking app,"I have several cooking apps, but I find myself using this one most often.  I like having a place to save recipes that I find and want to try.  It is so easy to save recipes from other websites and organize them into folders.  Almost all recipes appear as a picture with the name.  The app is always suggesting other cooking websites I might like.  I can browse Yummly for recipe ideas.  The app allows some customization, too, in the settings."
203,203,5,2020-01-31T01:53:18.000Z,Darisbell,Life changing!!,"We have eaten at home every night this week which we NEVER do and I credit this app for helping us.  Everything you need is all there.  Assemble the recipes you like, pick which ones you want for the week and put them onto your list.   Send the list to be compiled and it adds everything up to tell you totals of all ingredients to buy and then you pick which store you want to send your list to!!!  I LOVE this app!!!  My favorite one honestly!"

205,205,5,2020-02-26T03:31:18.000Z,butt_coconut,Great for beginner adults,"For someone that‚Äôs new to living on their own and essentially not really having very many recipes passed down from family members, this app is great for trying new recipes and saving money! Things have been really tight for my boyfriend and I and he‚Äôs a very picky eater so it‚Äôs hard to find recipes that we both enjoy. This app has provided so much of that and gives really great detailed information, like if a recipe is easy, quick and affordable!"
206,206,4,2020-04-28T14:17:34.000Z,Miss Ivy,Good but needs work,"I love this app when searching for new recipes, I like that I can creat my own folders/tabs to sort my recipes by breakfast, dinner, soups and ect. Within recent weeks the app hasn‚Äôt been loading, I‚Äôll only see 4 recipes I have saved out of 60 I have in ‚Äúdinner‚Äù tab, or I‚Äôll see a blank screen because nothing is loading. There‚Äôs an option to pay for access to other areas of the app but with these glitches I would be upset to pay for something that isn‚Äôt working properly."
207,207,5,2019-11-27T12:38:38.000Z,Sonyarenea,I love this app.,I am always looking for inspiration for something new and this app lets me do that. I look through it and see something I like and I sometimes make it like that or change it up a little bit. A couple of Thanksgivings ago I made a seafood dip from one of the recipes on here and it was a hit! I doubled the amount of seafood but other than that it was the same and it was the first thing that was completely gone. I highly recommend this app.
208,208,5,2019-09-27T10:26:34.000Z,Rob_Host,User friendly and enlightening,"I thought Yummly was going to be a run of the mill recipe apps: not easily accessible to variety of recipes, small selection of off shoot recipes and poor UI. I was very wrong. It‚Äôs the google of recipes and can be narrowed to fit specific dietary plans. They also had the heart to put in a ‚Äòskip to recipe‚Äô button rather than making you scroll through the authors life story before getting to the recipe. Excellent app, highly recommend it."

210,210,5,2018-05-16T11:28:19.000Z,Stacfacey111,Great App - love how it channels recipes from various blogs,"Yummly is my go-to app for finding recipes. I love to cook and explore new ingredients and diets. Yummly makes it easy and streamlined to discover recipes that utilize a specific ingredient with dietary requirements or restrictions. For example: I can search sugar-free, gluten-free, vegan cookie and many options are generated. Often, I research many recipes and then alter the recipe to fit my needs/dietary requirement. Yummly makes it easy to categorize recipes so that I can reference them again. I love Yummly!"
211,211,3,2018-06-24T17:33:58.000Z,Fatima baji,It's nice :),It's a really lovely application!
212,212,5,2018-07-29T21:02:18.000Z,Ty211221,One of the best recipe apps,"Finally, an app where I‚Äôm not forced to sit through a cooking video before they give me the recipe (looking at you, Genius Kitchen). The app is easy to navigate. Sometimes the pop ups are annoying but they don‚Äôt happen often. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that you usually have to scroll all the way down the page to get the directions. I don‚Äôt need an 8 paragraph backstory on how you obtained the recipe. But, overall, one of the best recipe apps."
213,213,5,2018-08-09T21:22:38.000Z,Maewkaew,Useful recipe app,"Yummly helps find new recipes to try from many different websites.   The Search function has a variety of filters that can search for recipes by ingredients, special diets, allergens, cuisines,  difficulty,  preparation time, etc.   The app also makes suggestions based on previous input."
214,214,5,2018-10-28T15:39:14.000Z,Cherrie B,Helpful,"I absolutely love this site. The recipes are fantastic. I have hundreds of them saved, and it can't wait to try them all. I recommend this site for everyone who loves to cook,  or who, like me, got tired of fixing the same old dishes. If you're looking to spice up your meals, try the vast amount of recipes on his site. The only negative thing is that I wanted to make a meal I found on the site. I clicked on the directions and it no longer existed. I was very disappointed."

After seeing its capability at CES 2018, I was hooked. Although certain app revisions created problems for me, I must say the app now functions as promised. Love the guided ‚Äùconnected‚Äù cooking as well as the newest ‚Äùfood recognition‚Äù capabilities. Keep up the good work Yummly, the future is looking bright. Now if I could only get Alexa to recognize my oven, we would be in some serious business."

There have been times I‚Äôve wanted to tell my crew to just eat air. But not anymore! Thanks to Yummly‚Äôs preferences, I can find wonderful recipes and make more than bland cardboard-esque concoctions. There‚Äôs a fantastic grocery list feature in which I can choose which items to add, in case I already have some of them in the pantry, and even add my own items. Brilliant!"
217,217,4,2020-06-12T01:33:00.000Z,MasterHyjinx,Generally really good,"The app has ingredients for recipes but when you click into the instructions it takes you to any old webpage you can do a web search for that shares a lot of ads and some story about how the recipe is something the author makes on rainy days, yadda yadda and you have to close the ads and scroll past the junk to see the instructions."

It has become my go-to recipe book because I have a gluten allergy, my dad is lactose intolerant and my mother in law is dairy free. My grandmother is also diabetic. When I‚Äôm cooking for the family I can change the search parameters and only get recipes that work for everyone‚Äôs special diet. Some recipes are kinda nuts but many are very easy and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to people who are not used to the substitution of special diets."

I used to use my recipe books, but now I find the recipes are more diverse and I can always find something I will save. My daughter is vegetarian & her family is not, so when I make meals when we go to Louisiana, I don‚Äôt need to bring a cookbook with me, I rely on Yummly for all my cooking! I choose my meals on the ingredients in the recipes and I have expanded our menus!! I have also discovered so many delicious desserts!!!"
221,221,4,2019-06-06T16:02:41.000Z,K'dera,Almost perfect but. . .,"I wish there was a way to add links from the internet when browsing. I‚Äôd like to transfer over my many recipes from Pinterest bc this app has better organization for recipes quite frankly but I‚Äôm unable to do it. The ability to do this would make life much simpler. That‚Äôs honestly the one up Pinterest has on you. Anyway just a suggestion. If I‚Äôm wrong and there‚Äôs an easy way to do this, please let me know! If this is ever integrated into the app, it‚Äôll be a definite 5 stars from me. Thanks!"

You can enter the ingredients you have and say how much time you want to spend prepping the meal and it will give you recipes that meet those specifications. You can save them in categorized lists. I have recommended Yummly to everyone I know. From new to seasoned chefs, there is something for everyone.I use this every day and have several recipes saved for Thanksgiving this year. :)"

You can create categories to save your ‚ÄúYums‚Äù, but the categories are not alphabetical and you can‚Äôt make them alphabetical. Because of this flaw, you have to scroll up and down to find what you‚Äôre looking for.    Every other recipe app allows for your categories to be alphabetical.    I scroll past what I‚Äôm looking for and have to rescroll.  Time wasted and annoying.  Otherwise, I love it"

But there at times are TOO many and it is overwhelming to try and sort through all them with their minor variations. But the worst part are the pseudobloggers who think I want to read through 20 pages of their thoughts or their experiences before I get to the actual recipe (and most that I have seen do not have the Jump to Recipe button). I don‚Äôt care about you, your kids, your dog, or whether you had spaghetti three times last week. I just want the recipe."
225,225,5,2020-09-26T23:01:48.000Z,Tigertail Rush,Too good to be true,I love this app. I was struggling to plan meals to make so we ate out a lot which is so expensive and not really a great idea these days anymore. I had Yummly in my phone but hadn‚Äôt really used it. When I started using it though it turned meals into  an exciting time of discovery for the whole family. Expanding flavor profiles and new discoveries. The family uses dinner time as a time to show off and sharpen cooking skills and trying new things. Thank you.
226,226,5,2020-05-24T02:50:02.000Z,MindfulMama75,Excellent organizing resource!,"Yummily goes beyond categorizing; It not only takes the breadth of internet sources and organizes them, it allows you to see what others think of recipes and gives you a place to create your own folders for anything. It‚Äôs seriously like the Pinterest of recipes but more functional in terms of cooking as it even gives you a shopping list, serving size help, and again the rating which I really appreciate. Thank you YUMMLY!"

Yes use Yacon potatoes but peeled and parboiled in salt. I also saut√©ed onions before layering, heavy cream more oz than called for (because that‚Äôs what the store had) and I melted a sharp and white blended cheese (because that‚Äôs what I had) mixed  with a little garlic powder.

This is a fantastic international cookbook with helpful features like grocery list generation, shopping assistance integration down to what aisle to seek in your local store, and scheduling. I‚Äôve saved money using this app by shopping sales and planning meals around them; additionally, I can pinpoint common ingredients between recipes and shop smarter that way, too. The best part is, I‚Äôm using mostly fresh ingredients (with no waste) now with this app‚Äôs organization."

I have found a wide variety of recipe options and I love being able to see reviews and stars about how others feel about a recipe.  If a recipe has lots of positive reviews I can use it with confidence.  Ididnt give 5 stars simply because sometimes I just can‚Äôt find what I need through this site but a general search turns up what I need.  The downside is however I‚Äôm never as confident as I am about trying new things with Yummly.

It‚Äôs like what the...?  I came to this app to look for recipes not people as if they‚Äôre looking for dates?  I‚Äôm not even sure why you‚Äôd plaster your face on a recipe instead of a picture of the food?  Even if you‚Äôre a professional, that‚Äôs great but if I‚Äôm looking for recipes featuring eggs and salmon I don‚Äôt want to see a random face I‚Äôd like to see the potential dish first, hence the three stars and that‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve seen random ‚Äúchefs‚Äù appear in place of displays for dishes."

It‚Äôs also so easy to quickly pull up recipe ingredients so I can add them to my grocery list. I can‚Äôt imagine switching to a different recipe and menu-planning app."

I have a lot of food allergies and Yummly is really the only app that I found at the time which lets you register foods that you can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt like to eat. This also sets you up for typing in ‚Äúdiet‚Äù plans you follow and the database is extensive! I hope someone else who‚Äôs got stricter eating habits will benefit from trying this app out, too!"
237,237,5,2020-04-24T21:05:06.000Z,Angie472,Yummly Rocks!!,"I love this app! It has thousands of recipes. It gives me a picture to go by. When I search, I love how many options I have! There‚Äôs the simple recipe, complex fancy one, quick one, I don‚Äôt have this ingredient, it literally has me covered in most scenarios. My favorites so far are the homemade taco seasoning and Italian meatballs! Better than my favorite Italian restaurants!! Seriously!! No matter what your looking for, they probably have several to choose from. Go for it!"
238,238,3,2020-03-26T18:03:31.000Z,jfififivovycycycyududuf,"Not bad, but needs work","I have been messing with this app and another for a few months now. The other app is much more user friendly but it does not have the recipe support that this one does. The other app can download recipes and videos from the internet for use which I have done for copycat recipes. But, those can be lost when a link changes, which has happened.  What I like here is that I can quickly get multiple recipes and look at them then see which one I have the ingredients for.  In the end I‚Äôll be continuing with both apps."
239,239,2,2020-04-05T20:39:22.000Z,s2s3s4,Not the same since the update,Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I LOVE Yummly!!! This app is a lifesaver and makes cooking at home (for ANY dietary restriction) easy and fun and different.
240,240,4,2017-09-23T22:33:15.000Z,Zomography13,Love this app but...,I love this app a lot. I find so many recipes. But I don't like the set a time to what time you want to start the meal. I never use it and my it doesn't fit my life style. Also I wish there's a button for the recipes you are not interested in. It be nice to have a button like that so it will make the recipe not show up again. It be nice to be able to stop seeing recipes you won't use. So you can see more variety of recipes instead seeing the few recipes you don't like all the time.
241,241,4,2018-06-08T03:15:52.000Z,Gamer gal 1534,Needs to tell the amount per serving!,"I‚Äôve only used this app for my diet for a couple of days but so far it‚Äôs been great! but sometimes when I want to share a meal with the family and make 4 servings, we all want to know how much it is for one. On most of the recipes you can set it to one serving and it‚Äôs not a problem to figure out how many cups or whatever measurement of it you can eat,but when it comes to figuring out how many cups it is per serving it gets difficult since most of them don‚Äôt say."
242,242,5,2018-10-05T10:06:32.000Z,Zephannix,Simple. Secure. Stacked with Recipes,The recipes I‚Äôve saved over the past four years are perfect. The Yummly app keeps me wanting to find more recipes. The fact that it is two clicks to any recipe is unbelievable. I‚Äôve cooked with it for a while and all I would ask for is the ability to have a text only version without basic ASCII art using only spoken languages. Would be perfect. Great app. Even better service. A free service that never stops giving.
243,243,5,2018-11-17T17:47:55.000Z,Les Receipts,"Great, ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù service",Yummly delivers almost all the recipes one may want in various formats to suit different types of cooks. It lets users customize personal folders as well as track and rate those recipes they have prepared. One can type a list of ingredients at hand and a slew of suggestions will pop up- a very helpful feature! The only improvement I would suggest is that the app add foreign language searches to expand users‚Äô cooking adventures.
244,244,5,2019-05-08T01:58:08.000Z,Indio Dro,Yummly is pretty awesome,I really don‚Äôt know what else to say. I find EVERY recipe I look for. I get inspired to make other recipes every time I use Yummly. Fantastic app and website.
245,245,5,2020-03-23T11:27:51.000Z,Misslin1998,So many delicious foods to choose from!,I love this app! Anytime I want inspiration on what to make for dinner or for a dessert I turn to this app. Love the design of the app and love the vast amount of recipes to choose from. Super clear and easy to know the ingredients and follow the instructions and it even includes reviews from other users on the app rating how the recipes turned out! Would totally recommend this app! It makes cooking fun and something to look forward to.

I work an average work well of 60+ hours as a deli manager and this has helped me make different Things for my family quickly and easily!!! Am really enjoying it and better than Pinterest because it‚Äôs just food lol nothing else to get distracted by! Well worth the money! My girls are 18,14, and 12 and they are all able to cook but this will help them to expand their knowledge in the kitchen.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
247,247,5,2020-11-15T01:29:20.000Z,Megganwith2g's,So Helpful,"As a former fast foodie desperate to make a change in the way my family and I eat, this app has been immensely helpful. It used to be so difficult for me to think about planning meals because I was trapped in a convenience mentality, thinking I didn‚Äôt have time for ‚Äúall that.‚Äù But Yummly helped me to think, plan, and execute without breaking the bank! I‚Äôm actually saving money and I feel so much better eating things I make myself. Thankful for this app!!"
248,248,5,2020-05-22T07:27:48.000Z,SirSkates,Worth the roll,"Made these for a HS FB potluck.  It was the only dessert that was completely eaten!  (This could also be because the other desserts appeared to be store-bought. i.e. brownies, cupcakes & cookies).  I made two batches‚Ä¶ One filled with apple pie, and the other with cherries."
249,249,5,2020-04-28T08:57:34.000Z,jaceynotstacey,Amazing,"Ok, I just got this app a few days ago, and I wish I could rate this more than 5 stars cuz this is so great and so much fun! At first, it was already perfect right when i opened the app, it asked me like what my diets are and what ‚ÄúYummly‚Äù should tell us when they enter like the names like ‚ÄúAlice, we had etc..‚Äù AND RIGHT WHEN I SIGNED IN, LET ME TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT HAD SO MANY RECIPES AND WAS THE BEST. It had the ingredients and ‚Äúadd to cart‚Äù and where you could get it and how to make it. Honestly Yummly, I love you guys. GET THIS APP RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVENT!"
250,250,5,2018-01-13T22:15:45.000Z,Beckihomecki,Love Yummly,"Great way to look up favorite recipes or find new ones. You can organize them how ever you like. Really like being able to take all of my favorite recipes along with me where ever I go. Also helpful to see which other recipes are yummed, the more people like it the best yet chance it‚Äôs a good recipe. The screen with the directions will always stay on, so while your making the recipe you never have to worry about it turning off."
251,251,5,2018-04-03T21:03:59.000Z,Orig.jodster,Awesome for a vegetarian diet,"The recipes are great, easy to follow and inspirational. I just browsed through the app. Then while I was at the grocery store I kept referencing the new recipes to put together several dinners. Now we have all the ingredients we need to create unique meals. My only suggestion is that users could link their accounts so my boyfriend and I could select recipes together, and access them without having to message them to each other."
252,252,5,2018-06-12T00:01:45.000Z,alissahhhhhn,"The recipes aren‚Äôt generic, like you find on Google.",I like that Yummly provides family recipes and originality! Plus there are hundreds of options. I also like the fact that the app will create a shopping Lia once you have liked a meal and allows you to check off the items you‚Äôve already placed in your cart instead of having to scroll through the entire list every time (plus they‚Äôre categorized by aisles!).
253,253,5,2018-08-14T18:12:38.000Z,rhaycox,Best Recipe Organizer Ever!!!,"I absolutely LOVE this app!  I like how my phone syncs well with it and when I‚Äôm on Facebook or Pinterest or any blog or webpage and I see a must try recipe, all I have to do is click and drop. I love how I can custom organize for main dish, breakfast, pastries, etc. to help me find what I am looking for faster. The grocery list is also helpful and I like scheduling my meals with the meal plan feature as well!  Please don‚Äôt ever go away or cooking/baking will cease to exist in our house!!! ;)"
254,254,5,2018-10-07T22:33:28.000Z,Farting banana,Great recipe site !,I get all my recipes from Yummly!!
255,255,5,2020-07-04T23:01:39.000Z,NewPOS-tek,An app for every diet type even those of us struggling with avoidance of Type2Diabities,"Keto or Plant based diet u name it...and what I like most about it is the convenience to put only those ingredients you need on your shop list and those recipes your dying to try! I give it four outta fives stars! Only thing missing is a Diabetic suggestions section, though many of its recipes fall into this category you‚Äôll have to search for them."
256,256,3,2021-07-16T14:12:16.000Z,Bekah CW,Why does everything cost extra??,I‚Äôve been using Yummly for about 3 years and absolutely loved that I was able to easily access recipes that met my allergy and dietary restrictions. There are so many apps out there now but they all cost so much and it was great I could filter without additional cost.
257,257,5,2020-05-01T03:48:13.000Z,MAG'IE,Yummy,"Good and easy to read. I truly appreciate the feature where I can place a grocery list if I don‚Äôt have the recipe ingredients, and the photo of the dishes outcome is a super big help along with the sectional breakdown for cuisine style. The overall profile set up is amazing and I can locate exactly what I need with ease. I would like if there were less advertising though. Other than that, I approve and look forward to continuing my service."
258,258,2,2020-05-17T21:16:00.000Z,katiedoodlebug,Search Criterion Don‚Äôt Work,"At first this app was perfect; you could save recipes for later and it was awesome... the first issue I had with it was every time I would be in my saved recipes, if I selected one to look at, when I would go back to my main saved page, I have to start at the top of my list all over again, even if the recipe I was looking at was second to last. Then when u search they have questions they ask to narrow in your results; they seem to do the exact opposite of what you want... and that includes showing u recipes that have ingredients you specifically did NOT WANT."
259,259,4,2019-07-09T00:15:42.000Z,Egpete,Ends the what‚Äôs for ?,"Yummly is great for trying to use up what you have on hand or coming up with ideas using the weeks grocery ads. Also, like that you can save recipes you find for the future or have come to use often. What keeps it from perfection is the fact you have to leave the app to see the recipe and having to go back and fourth until you‚Äôve found what you need can get old. Otherwise highly recommend and have found many new favorites."
260,260,5,2019-03-20T04:14:38.000Z,Lucybel,Fabulous Way To Prepare Food!,Yummy has been arriving to me through my email for quite some time but the Yummly App is new to me and it is indeed exceptional! If you do not have the Yummly App and you enjoy cooking or at least preparing food then you must try it! It's a pleasure to find dishes you and your family will enjoy and its so user friendly. The review section is very helpful and the photos shoe the real thing! I have been impressed and I believe you will be as well!
261,261,5,2019-04-03T00:18:00.000Z,Austinmamatobe,Time saver & fun!,"Fun to scroll through photos and great way to meal plan with scheduling feature and love the alert to remind you to start prepping before scheduled meal time. Most recipes fairly easy to adjust as needed also. Wish there was a feature to save all the scheduled meals for the week or somehow integrate or save a meal plan to use again instead of having to reschedule each individually, but love love this app have used for years and will continue to!"
262,262,5,2019-04-30T14:36:26.000Z,Mikayla Lotus,Absolutely amazing for vegans,"One of my go to apps for finding recipes quickly and easily. You don‚Äôt even have to worry about filtering by vegan or looking for ‚Äúvegan versions‚Äù of food. Simply check ‚Äúvegan‚Äù as your diet when initially creating your account, and every recipe you ever see in the app will automatically be vegan! And it has everything. I‚Äôve never searched for a food and bad less than 20 or 30 different recipes to try."
263,263,5,2020-11-05T22:06:46.000Z,battleborn88,Great,"The app is absolutely wonderful, I just wish you could categorize and sort the recipes you like easier and if it had a way to make a readily accessible grocery list would be nice. Also a big issue I have is that the list of recipes always refreshes from the top of the list when you go back from selecting a recipe making it frustrating sometimes when browsing down the list"
264,264,1,2021-01-17T23:06:51.000Z,ItsMyNickname,Terrible,Why would a recipe company put the actual recipes with ingredients and directions front and center when they can hide it behind 10 different things you need to click out of the way?
265,265,4,2021-01-05T15:27:19.000Z,AuntieOO,OverBoard,"My only complaint is the sheer volume you get for options. And I suppose, diff groups pay to promote their recipes first as I see them several times when scrolling. I know the point is to find as many/all recipes but whoa. I‚Äôm not quite sure how to minimize the options."
266,266,5,2020-05-05T20:00:35.000Z,Grei K,How I learned to be a vegan cook!,"I always fancied myself as a pretty good cook, but when I became a Vegan 8 years ago, I knew little to nothing about vegan cooking. I tried several online recipe apps. to help me get started including Yummly and soon found that to be my number one favorite go to app. What I like most about it is that it tracks my profile preferences and regularly sends me recommendations for new recipes based upon my previous selected recipes."
267,267,5,2020-03-21T17:13:06.000Z,Montey Beans,Go-to App for recipes,"This is the only app I use these days.  I‚Äôve never had any technical issues. It has a variety of categories and multiple recipes of each thing; which I like to pull methods, combine and test.  The one thing that's a bit annoying is the navigation to the actual directions.  Makes it hard to scan quickly when looking for recipes to try.  But, it‚Äôs still my #1 pick."
268,268,5,2019-09-18T20:19:07.000Z,jones4girls,This is my go to for quick dinners especially for my instant pot and air fryer!!,I just wish directions were easier to get to instead of clicking in separate link and then having to scroll down to find the recipe card....I use this for quick meals so I do not have time to read the blog part I just need the recipe...fast...‚ò∫Ô∏è a family of 6 is always not so patiently waiting...üòÇ
269,269,3,2020-02-09T19:51:02.000Z,SA00COBAH,Needs improvement,"Overall concept is great. But plenty of issues that make me avoid the app : the grocery feature doesn‚Äôt work right. Either it doesn‚Äôt load when I select Buy or i have to log into Instacart every single time. The recipes itself are not on the app, it‚Äôs redirected to a URL, which is annoying. The print feature doesn‚Äôt work when you want to print the recipe. Have to open in safari then print. Basically a bunch of simple fixes could make this the best app, but unfortunately it misses the mark."
270,270,4,2018-09-09T23:09:07.000Z,Guide5,Enjoy app,"With vision issues, I use speech on my phone. It works pretty well. I wish that links such as add   items to shopping list  were all together so f I want to use this feature I could.   I do not like it at the beginning. I like to see ingredients so I can tell if I have every things"
271,271,5,2018-10-31T23:54:47.000Z,ilove2eatalot,Ilove2eatalot,I love how the app has a lot recipes to choose from and how it allows you to add the recipe to your calendar for easy meal planning. What I love the most is it makes grocery shopping so much easier as your able to add the ingredients you‚Äôll need to your grocery list. When shopping your able to check off the ingredients as you go. I always forget something from the store so this was a plus!
272,272,5,2021-02-24T15:35:04.000Z,LilyMcGilly,Go-To App with an aside,"This is my go to app. I only dislike that directions aren‚Äôt contained within the listings and take you to these bloggy articles. I don‚Äôt want more than the ingredients, method and maybe a video."
273,273,5,2019-08-10T18:57:55.000Z,castle_doll,Game changer!,"I was using Pinterest before to find recipes. I have to cook with several food allergies in mind (AIP paleo). While this app does cover all those allergies, it covers some major ones and shows those recipes on my feed. It‚Äôs amazing because I can tell it when I want to eat dinner and it will set reminders for me that I need to start cooking at a certain time. It will also find recipes for me when I only have a few ingredients!  Amazing."
274,274,4,2020-05-29T21:31:55.000Z,ant- eater 12,I have a bit to say...,"Yummly has every recipe I want and even some I have never heard of. It has a wide variety of food, Lots of sweet treats, salty snacks, and whole, healthy meals. I will say that they do not offer substitutes for some of the ingredients I do not have at home and that has always been an issue for me because I don‚Äôt always want to go to the store for ingredients. All in all, I think that Yummly is a really great app with lots of food options. I really recommend this app and hope you like it too!"
275,275,3,2020-04-10T15:52:17.000Z,Echo003,Frequently frozen and full of ads,"I don‚Äôt know what happened but recently Yummly has become very slow, and sometimes even just frozen there. Yes there are tons of recipes options there, but once you click to view the detailed directions/instructions, it will link you to an external website/original recipe websites, and those websites can be full of ads and hard to use."
276,276,3,2019-10-21T10:46:59.000Z,dadaybobo,YUMMLY REVIEW,"I have always enjoyed using Yummly and would look at it several times a week. I had created quite a recipe box of my own on your site. However, following the last update, the site does not function as smoothly as it had in the past. The screen would freeze repearedly and recipes would not open. I have tried at various different times and there are still difficulties."
277,277,5,2020-07-14T10:54:23.000Z,Maybelle180,Great app! Pleasantly surprised.,"Honestly, I really don't like getting more apps but this one totally works - even if you don't pay for the recommended subscriptions. They don‚Äôt even harass you about upgrading."
278,278,4,2020-12-02T22:25:30.000Z,kcooka,Good way to find a way to use what you have in the house.,I like Yummly to find recipes that use the items I have or the time I have. The downside is that it takes you to another person site and sometimes it's difficult to find the directions. Also sometimes there's a difference between what Emily Post says the ingredients and what the original poster list as ingredients. Overall though I have loved using Yummly to find new recipes that I wouldn't ordinarily try.
279,279,5,2020-05-04T13:16:41.000Z,BelladawnaRed26,Life saver,"In all of the ways, Yummly was introduced to me by a friend that inspired me to turn my life around in the nutrition area. Married and not sure what to cook, Yummly encourages you to type the items in your fridge and it will send you all the possibilities with those ingredients. It always turns out yummy!! Plus with the opportunity to personalize your profile with foods you enjoy and what you‚Äôd don‚Äôt, you never have to worry about yucky turn outs. I love Yummly and Yummly loves me."
280,280,5,2018-12-27T02:06:00.000Z,User 56368,Recommend this app to everyone I know,"Yummly has helped me to expand my cooking repertoire beyond what I ever thought possible. I love searching recipes using just one or two ingredients or simply scrolling through suggestions. If I had to find a complaint, it would be that suggestions are often redundant (either within the list or with others I've ""yummed.""). But I love the ability to save recipes for later, too!"
281,281,5,2019-02-17T15:17:48.000Z,ally quinlan,Must have,I use this app almost every day. I‚Äôm a busy mom with toddlers hanging off me all the time and Yummly is so user friendly o can find what I want right away. I can use it to quickly find last minute recipes using what ingredients I have on hand or make shopping lists for when I can actually make it the grocery store. I‚Äôve also found amazing food blogs and cooks through the recipe links. Highly recommend this app!
282,282,4,2019-02-27T01:29:23.000Z,llBabyGiraffe,Very useful!,This app has really expanded my family‚Äôs ability to cook meals that are edible (mainly because we have no idea what goes well together). The search engine is perfect for using what you have in the house to create a meal.
283,283,5,2020-11-09T16:01:15.000Z,Sbadgio,My Go-To Cooking App,"Yummly has been my Go-To cooking app for years!  There are so many options for finding a recipe that fits your requirements, whether that may be nutritional, skill level or ingredient availability. I love having the ability to create my own categories for saved recipes.  My wishlist for future releases is to have the ability to personalize a recipe in my Yums by making/saving notes.  I recommend this app to all my friends!"
284,284,3,2020-12-31T17:45:09.000Z,Mrs Aguilera,User review,"I like that I can go to the app and find a recipe pretty quickly. I do prefer the old version of type in what I am looking for and get a group of recipes to choose from. Now there are so many questions and ingredient breakdowns i notice I become frustrated with the process before i even get a recipe and close the app. I am adding to my previous review, I struggle with the recipes and videos of the Chefs that in the middle of recipes I can use it wants me to pay for the video of the chefs. I find I do not use that as often as I used to."
285,285,5,2020-06-12T00:57:00.000Z,La19la80,Great resource!!,I love recipes. And I love these recipes. They are easy to understand. And it‚Äôs simple to add all of the items to a shopping list. This make dinner so much easier. And there are so many options. I also like that you can search by specific types of diets.  I also like the variety of drinks and kid friendly recipes. This app makes eating healthy very easy and convenient. I will definitely continue to use these recipes.
286,286,3,2020-10-21T03:30:21.000Z,*hjkl,Folders,I really like that I can save the recipes in different folders. It does help to sort through. But I do not like that I can not add personal notes on what I might have changed in the recipe. The search section that lists ingredients that you want to use or have is kind of useless. Takes more time to find saved ingredients than to type in. Would be helpful if they were in alphabetical order. Now I am trying to post and it wants a nickname and everything is taken. No suggestions. I have already tried 8.
287,287,4,2020-10-02T15:18:42.000Z,pizza feen,Great way to organize,It helps me stay on top of my weekly meals and still be creative. I set up meal weeks which also helps dinner budget not go out of control. It also helps with recipes that may not have gone over well with my family  by allowing me to created a never try again file.
288,288,5,2020-06-09T02:12:37.000Z,AGraf345,Save your online recipes here!,"What a wonderful app.  It‚Äôs a search engine for online recipes.  Very organized way of searching recipes by ingredients or by cooking method: Hit the ‚Äúyum‚Äù icon and it is saved. Then you can move your ‚ÄúYumed‚Äù recipes to a category (breakfast, dinner, desserts, etc.).  Easy way to find those online recipes that you love. I‚Äôm sure there is more it can do because I am just getting started.  I highly recommend it."
289,289,3,2019-09-27T01:12:29.000Z,2coolbaby,Couple issues,"There are a couple issues with this app that drive me bonkers! First, our folders don‚Äôt get alphabetized so when I want to add a recipe to one, I have to scroll through my TONS of folders! Very aggravating when it should be so simple. I get maybe putting the last folder you used in top, but this is an organizational mess! Lastly and this is HUGE for me! When you open the app it silenced your music! WTH Yummly?!!!! I dance and jam to loud music when I cook and you make that really difficult with your taking over my music choices! FIX THAT!"
290,290,5,2017-10-09T13:59:53.000Z,cni529,Great access to so many recipes in one location!,I do love the Yummly app because it provides one place for me to look for a bunch of variations on one recipe. I also like that you can save your favorite recipes in the app because I go back to them very often instead of printing them all. Sometimes I don't always find a recipe I'm looking for so I have to go out of the app -that's my only critique. Other than that absolutely LOVE this app!
291,291,5,2018-10-05T18:06:51.000Z,Best Cooking Helper!,Best cooking helper!,"This app is extremely helpful with everything when it comes to cooking. You‚Äôre able to find recipes when you have specific or limited ingredients. One of the cool features I like about it , is that you‚Äôre able to adjust the serving size of the recipe so for that day when you‚Äôre expecting to feed 8+ the app automatically changes the measurements for you. Cooking with Yummly is always seamless!"
292,292,5,2018-10-28T22:57:03.000Z,Docclay!,Yummly Reviw,"I have used several recipe apps and this is the easiest and most versatile I‚Äôve found.  If you know the name of a dish you want to attempt, they nearly always have it, likely several.  If you just want to look at recipes for an ingredient, you can do that too.  And if you develop preferences for a particular blogger, you can view their recipe collections.  That‚Äôs just what I use Yummly for but there are a lot of other possibilities."
293,293,5,2018-11-02T17:41:02.000Z,anndelacy,Good idea but hard to follow,"I‚Äôm a foodie and quickly signed up for the app. Unfortunately, when I click on a recipe I receive via email, I‚Äôm EVENTUALLY provided recipes I don‚Äôt want to see and, for goodness sake, why do I have to go through so much drama to get directions?!"
294,294,5,2019-03-10T05:06:07.000Z,KourtCake,"Love, love and more love!","I usually don‚Äôt review apps but I just had to take the time to for this little gem. Yummly has taken my cooking to a whole new level and I‚Äôm so grateful for all the amazingly delicious recipes right at my finger tips! Super easy to use, so many recipes and it‚Äôs COMPLETELY free. My kitchen has has definitely been getting since I found Yummly and I can‚Äôt thank them enough. My husbands tummy thanks you profusely, haha!"
295,295,5,2019-03-27T17:42:43.000Z,dmarrujo1,Love Yummly,"I‚Äôve been using Yummly for a couple years and we‚Äôre very happy with the app and recipes. Many of them are keepers that we make on a regular basis.  Have only had one recipe not come out tasting good, but that‚Äôs bound to happen every now and then.  Everything else I‚Äôve made turned out terrific, and we‚Äôre super happy with it.  We like to choose 1 new recipe each week to try, and look forward to adding a new recipe to our repertoire."
296,296,5,2019-05-10T15:51:02.000Z,Hope_ut,This app is the first to actually get me cooking!!,"This app is wonderful! I‚Äôve been trying to get motivated to cook at home more for years now, and everything in this app just looks so appetizing (and easy to find simple recipes) that I‚Äôve finally gotten excited to cook at home!! I love it. I‚Äôve done enchiladas, pork roast, and a few others now. I‚Äôve also recommended it to some family members and they love it too. Download it and get started!!"
297,297,5,2021-05-12T15:16:32.000Z,cokbakmom,My Favorite Recipes,"I began to follow Yummly last year while looking for recipes that did not consist of a long list of ingredients and involved cooking instructions. I LOVE to both bake and cook! So, I decided to try one of their recipes and, then, another and another and, very quickly, decided that Yummly was exactly what I was looking for.....I have never been disappointed! Yummly is at the top of my recipes list, along with my long time favorites!"
298,298,5,2020-12-26T21:55:23.000Z,Mtymedic,Best app ever,"I have use Yummly for ever. I love it. I have several hundred recipes saved. I love how the search engine works, search by cooking type like slow cooker, instant pot, BBQ, etc. the recipes are diverse and wonderful. I have multiple co-workers who I have gotten to use this app as well. Everybody loves it. I‚Äôll admit I do t know how I feel about having to pay now since it had always been free in the past. But for the money I believe it‚Äôs worth it."
299,299,4,2020-11-20T00:30:33.000Z,Squidderz,Very good! But..,"Great app! I like that there are ratings on recipes and that you can leave a review on them. I also like that you can search ingredients you have on hand for recipes that use those ingredients, but I wish it would find recipes that use those ingredients as something other than the main part of it. For example if I search ground beef, I would like a variety of options that include ground beef rather than just ones that use ground beef in the title."
300,300,5,2018-05-13T16:08:06.000Z,superstition rose,Great!,"Tons of recipes to choose from. I really like how it is compatible with myfitnesspal for importing recipes from websites. The only complaint I have is the same with every other app I have ever used.... No pinch / zoom functionality until it links you to a webpage that has it. Unfortunately there are still webpages that haven't figured out that people are accessing the web on mobile devices, but I digress.... Great app."
301,301,5,2018-07-07T20:04:41.000Z,Mary McKnight Fancher,Mary McKnight Fsncher,"I love this app. This is so convenient once you build up your Yummly Recipe box. If I get a specific request for dinner I just go to my Yummly box, click in search, type in the name of the Recipe and there it is.  Also, I love the feature that allows you to print the list of ingredients. I just take an inventory of what ingredients I may already have , and mark those off of my list. You save money with that feature."
302,302,5,2018-07-19T02:18:33.000Z,Randorelli,Quick resource,"For quick an easy ideas and recipes, this is a good app. However, not all recipes turn out as well. It's hit or miss, but that is not Yummly's fault; the app merely directs one to recipes. One of the biggest issues I have is trying to use the app while I am cooking. If my iPhone goes to sleep and I reopen to the app, it is not always on the recipe I was last on. Other than that, it is my go-to-app for recipes and cocktails."
303,303,5,2019-01-06T20:31:40.000Z,JMT699398,Love the ease of it all!,"I like to cook but I hate the organization of it all- the shopping for ingredients, making the list of"
304,304,5,2019-07-14T22:48:42.000Z,KGoose10,A great source for first time cooks,I‚Äôm a college student who had 0 experience cooking for herself prior to using this app. The variety of easy recipes is great even for a newbie like me and the video step-by-step recipes are especially helpful. The best feature I would say is the shopping list which allows you to add all the ingredients from a recipe or any other ingredient you want to get on the side as well - super helpful in the grocery store!
305,305,5,2020-04-06T20:54:19.000Z,MatthewMarkJoshua,My Go To Recipe Sight,"Yummly has a huge access to recipes. They tell you what to buy, they even set up a list to buy and where to get it & then give you complete directions with feedback on said recipe & don‚Äôt even get me started on options, they have tons of options that can be narrowed down to flavor, cooking styles & what you have in your kitchen right now. I would recommend to new & experienced cooks alike."
306,306,2,2020-06-14T19:00:32.000Z,"Name#1,954",Annoying App,"First, I love Yummly and routinely use their recipes that I find online. Today, I downloaded the app and it is so annoying, 8m going to remove it! When I tell you once that I‚Äôm not interested in Yummly Pro, it should not pop up every time I click on a recipe. When I click on a recipe, I just want to see that recipe. Period. This app seems to be trying to give me everything but the recipe I‚Äôm trying to get to. I can eventually get the recipe, but it takes persistence. Other recipe apps are much less cumbersome to use. Trying to use on an iPad Pro, updated with the latest software."
307,307,5,2019-06-21T18:44:55.000Z,Lilahlee,Better Health because of homemade foods,"I love this app in that it has a great variety of recipes from several sources, the ability to create shopping list is a nice feature. My family has loved almost every recipe that I have tried and I love being able to provide truly homemade food in hopes of healthier waist lines. We have cut preservatives out of our home and that has helped with Thyroid condition along with cholesterol counts."
308,308,3,2020-01-19T04:12:24.000Z,AllAngelsFall,Great but annoying sometimes,"I love the app, but using it on my phone, if I‚Äôm scrolling through my ‚ÄúYums,‚Äù if I select one to look at the ingredients, then go back, it takes me back to the very top. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to scroll all the way back down (with intermittent loading of my recipes) to where I was. I think this app is great, but I have tons of recipes saved and it is a hassle scrolling all the way back down after viewing a recipe. If this gets fixed it would definitely be a 5 star rating from me."
309,309,3,2019-08-25T15:18:28.000Z,CSurerus,Really like but,"I really like this app but gave it 3 stars. The read is they always give me the same recipe pretty much every single day!! Rarely do they offer up something new. If they actually showed a different recipe for every day or every other day, I would give them 5 stars! Plus now they want you to subscribe to their Pro version, which if you do you then are allowed access to the videos of recipes from specific chefs. Why subscribe when I have 2 other cooking apps that allow me to access videos for free?"
310,310,5,2021-02-03T23:59:37.000Z,privacy#1,FoodFan,"Love this app.  It‚Äôs one of my favorite go to‚Äôs for recipes.  There seems to be thousands.  Love that you can opt for food preferences, needs, allergies, etc.  Able to save and categorize recipes.  I must admit though, that a lot of recipes I saved have disappeared.  All in all if you‚Äôre looking for a recipe from seemingly any part of the world this is the spot to look.  Great for beginners and seasoned cooks alike.  Just give it a try and you‚Äôll fall in love."
311,311,3,2021-03-24T00:16:34.000Z,4ufun,Yummly Review,Pretty good app. Imaginative recipes. App is pretty easy to use. Still learning my way around the site.
312,312,5,2020-12-26T05:47:01.000Z,Groovy Chef,Yummly,"I finally started cooking again because of Yummly. There are so many choices in different categories that I could cook a different meal for my family every night for a year! The recipes are healthy, not complicated, and the desserts are amazing!!!!! I have digestive stomach issues and finding a meal for me isn‚Äôt difficult any more."
313,313,5,2020-11-22T17:36:31.000Z,AL in MN,Love it! Use almost daily,"I have been using the app for years and have built up quite a recipe book. I love that I can make notes about the recipes and read what others say. I also search for new recipes frequently using the detailed filters. I turned on a setting that I am vegan, and non-vegan recipes never show up (easy to flip on and off I‚Äôd needed though). Super handy for this busy mom!"
314,314,5,2020-03-27T13:53:52.000Z,I love trivia!,Like Pinterest for food!,"If you're like me and like to look up random recipes when you're in the mood to cook dinner or bake dessert, this is the perfect app for you! It's like Pinterest, shows photos of the recipe so you have a visual before you click. You can make shopping lists based upon your recipes and take this to the store! It's very interactive and pulls from several websites of recipes. I've used for 5 years."
315,315,4,2020-10-19T23:49:28.000Z,ckemorton,"It‚Äôs okay, generally","It‚Äôs generally great.  I hate that they place these super awesome recipes towards the front but you have to pay for them.  I‚Äôm also not much of a fan of having to read a whole story about the recipe before I actually get to the recipe.  But in general, it works.  I have made many things.  Read the comments on the recipe to get some suggestions and feedback...some things are very off on the ingredients and the comments will help direct you."
316,316,4,2020-04-12T22:05:53.000Z,WyattCatron,Mostly great.,"Love the recipes from this app. Love the grocery list function, EXCEPT when you view the items by recipes there is a little minus symbol on the top right next to each recipe title. In most of the User Interfaces I‚Äôve seen for (almost anything) that is the HIDE symbol. I wanted to collapse that menu to see just the titles of the recipes. However, this removed them from my list... that seemed very counter intuitive and undid a lot of time I spent on my first experience with the app."
317,317,5,2020-03-22T15:27:12.000Z,Linnlou,"Love it, but can we thrown in the fridge?","Should add a ‚ÄòMy Fridge‚Äô feature of listing what you have in stock. Then the option to find recipes based on what you have would be even cooler, because you wouldn‚Äôt have to re-enter what you have on hand each time, and it would populate many more recipes as well as a handy tool when grocery shopping, ‚Äúoh do I have some of that? Let me check my Yummy fridge‚Äù."
318,318,5,2020-01-22T17:42:50.000Z,Hamm Mom,LOVE this app!!,I‚Äôve been using this app to menu plan and organize my grocery list. I‚Äôve tried a bunch of the recipes and have loved them! It‚Äôs also so amazing that the app connects to your online grocery shopping accounts. That makes menu planning/shopping SO easy!!! It‚Äôs also wonderful that you can find a ton of recipes that fit whatever special diets you‚Äôre needing to accommodate. Highly recommend Ymmily!
319,319,5,2019-12-15T15:02:35.000Z,Natalie09524!,Fantastic,"Whenever I get in a food rut of eating the same thing I always find new tasty recipes to keep spicing things up with my dinners and lunches! Love this app and step-by-step instructions, nutrition facts, diet options and ingredients it provides. Would recommend app to cooks of all skill levels. Only downside is all the adds on the app when you try to scroll to find the directions. Otherwise no complaints!!"
320,320,5,2018-06-08T08:54:30.000Z,Gumbo-roux,Yummy Yummly,I love this recipe index because it pulls from many different sources. I can often look at several of the same recipes and combine or subtract what I want. The pictures are great. It‚Äôs easy to use and generally has everything I‚Äôll look for when I‚Äôm wanting to make a certain recipe. I no longer have to have tons of books in my kitchen and sit there and look through them all for the right recipe.
321,321,5,2018-08-15T18:42:06.000Z,Judith Faye,This app is my all time favorite!,"I literally tell everyone about this app and how it works because it saved my life! I didn‚Äôt know how to cook and hated cookbooks because there were usually only a handful of recipes I liked. I found this app and was able to teach myself how to cook, collect hundreds of recipes that I can use for my family and access them whenever I need them without a hassle. I love this app! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
322,322,5,2018-08-16T21:39:53.000Z,teddiLe,Everything is wonderful!,I use at least 3 times per week or more... always able to find recipes for what I have on hand‚Äîand even special trip to the store makes for wonderful dishes that even my finicky husband LOVES...amazing!
323,323,5,2019-02-09T15:22:23.000Z,Wutthefuk,thank you‚ò∫Ô∏è,"I cook for my family and I was getting bored with the same meals every week.  I was losing my passion for preparing meals! This app is amazing! It has a ton of recipes, easy directions, reviews so you can read on how others who‚Äôve tried to make the dish felt about how theirs came out or what they may want to do different. I love the lay out and the search tool. I normally don‚Äôt post reviews but this app is well deserving imo!"
324,324,5,2021-07-24T23:51:27.000Z,CCCC_chick,Love the ideas,I love the variety! I like looking up different ways to make one dish and decide which ingredients I think will fit my taste best! I like how it gets the recipes from multiple different sources too! The yum function makes it easy for me to save dishes I‚Äôm intrigued by and sorts them into nice categories too! I‚Äôve only used free so I‚Äôm not sure what else I‚Äôm missing with the premium but I‚Äôm happy with what is offered to me.
325,325,5,2021-04-01T15:00:37.000Z,T.E.R.I,My go to,"Yummly is my go to recipe finder. I have not found any that I don‚Äôt like. I love the fact you can just put one word  in search and it will list so many recipes!  So, if you‚Äôre stuck figuring out what to make and you have, for example chicken in the frig, and not sure what to make with it, use Yummly. You will be very pleased. Don‚Äôt forget to check out recipes for desserts, veggies, appetizers, etc. Yummly has it all."
326,326,5,2019-10-14T23:56:08.000Z,Vix.LeB,In Love with Yummly,"This is the best app for recipes and to be able to throw something together ASAP. I love all the features, like being able to search recipes by the ingredients you already have, and being able to omit the ingredients that you do not care for from your search options. This is a wonderful app. I have already begun experimenting more with recipes due to how easy this app is to use."
327,327,2,2021-02-18T00:00:39.000Z,yojjoy,Annoyed,"This app has been my go-to app for almost every recipe I have made for the past several years. One of my favorite features was the ability to mark a recipe as Scheduled and Made. It helped me keep track of my planning for the week as well as my grocery shopping.  But now, the only way to ‚Äúschedule‚Äù is to use the new $4.99/ month (!) Add to Meal Plan feature. I am annoyed and disgusted that you took the Scheduled and Made feature away and replaced with a $5/month feature.  Now I have to try to remember which delectable recipe I decided upon after reviewing dozens."
328,328,4,2019-10-17T22:56:05.000Z,Peanutbutterpaige,Super helpful,"Yummly is the only free recipes app that I can find that does what I need it to do. I use it to make a meal plan every week for breakfast, lunches, and dinners for my family. I love how you can customize the number of servings on each recipe and add them straight to your shopping list. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that you can‚Äôt edit items on your shopping list. If you need to change something you have to completely delete it and start over."
329,329,4,2021-08-09T22:21:53.000Z,BAS709,You never know what the updates will bring,"When I first installed the app I loved it and used it quite often. One of the updates took the free meal planner/calendar away and began charging for something similar allowing a grocery list. The most recent update has a free grocery list, but now you can‚Äôt list your favorite ‚ÄúYum‚Äôs‚Äù in categories and now I have to search any new recipes. I wish it would go back to when I first downloaded it."
330,330,5,2018-02-11T21:31:40.000Z,honest713,Amazing,You have to love the fact that there are other people‚Äôs reviews from when they made a certain dish are 100% real people. The people also recommend substitutes or different little tweaks that they have used which is great. My favorite thing about this app is the recommended dishes based on what diet you‚Äôre on. I‚Äôve used this app for weeks now and my family loves every dish I‚Äôve made thanks to Yummly!
331,331,5,2018-07-04T14:14:54.000Z,Eva1234123,Excellent App!,"This app is the best thing that ever happened to my dinner table! Rather than having the same old dishes from week to week, now we open Yummly & look for something new to try. We also compare recipes to see what we would like given the ingredients in different takes of the same dish like our favorite pastas. It's easy to use & the filters make sticking to a dietary plan simple! Love the app!"
332,332,3,2018-11-03T02:03:12.000Z,Chfdrhbkoff,A lot of recipes - functionality can be frustrating.,"I enjoy searching by ingredients or specific chef. The functionality can be frustrating. I opened Yummly without logging in on a new device and the featured recipes had diversity that I don‚Äôt see, for instance: if I looked up banana bread last time, I will see mostly banana bread recipes for the next year.  Previously, the directions link took you to the owner‚Äôs site, now the directions are embedded and emailing a link includes a 250 character subject. Other than that, it‚Äôs great."
333,333,5,2019-03-18T17:35:04.000Z,Jack McMullan,Wonderful,It delivers healthy delicious and exciting meals at a tap. Anywhere from simple to complex three course meals. It has a fluid interface and intuitive design that makes accessing what you want very simple. The emails they send you are customized to your preferences meaning they send you emails about what you are interested and a small suggested meal to widen your horizon. What can I say this app delivers what it says it will and more. Excellent!
334,334,5,2019-03-23T16:38:50.000Z,Mmeeeeew!,Good collection,I enjoy this app and have made many of the recipes.  I like the option to save and organize recipes and shopping list feature.  The only down fall is that in order to access recipes you have to click on a link but 99.9% of the links have been reliable. I imagine we have more access to recipes via the links so I can't complain too much.
335,335,5,2020-10-18T02:05:50.000Z,Misz Kay,Awesome,Amazing app and has a variety of recipes to choose from. They offer suggestions for me personally and it is amazing. From easy to difficult recipes yummly has pretty much all.  Only snag i ran into was a few recipes that say 24 ingredients but in fact it is 12 because the recipe shows duplicates but if you are a seasoned cook or baker you will quickly recognize it. But that aside i absolutely love this app.
336,336,4,2020-08-16T13:42:55.000Z,D.Rudder,"Good app, some flaws","There‚Äôs some really great functionality and innovation in this app. The login via email token instead of password is very undesirable and a poor authentication choice. The UX for my collections and Yum‚Äôd categories leaves a lot to be desired. A better thought out system for stuff I want to cook, and stuff I have already cooked would be great, but maybe I‚Äôm just not using the app right. Either way, I highly recommend this as the developers are very innovative."
337,337,5,2021-01-08T18:47:36.000Z,Kh4981,"I love love Yummly,","The Yummly app is so well done. It‚Äôs easy, intuitive and thorough in meeting the needs and desires of its interested user."
338,338,5,2020-11-30T23:34:21.000Z,Rickn'Jill,Love this App,I‚Äôve been using Yummly for several years now and have not been disappointed. I‚Äôve tried recipes in all forms and experimented with things I would otherwise not have tried. The reviews and alteration made by users is helpful.
339,339,5,2020-08-25T13:29:04.000Z,Tran323,Great food app with a lot of recipes,"Very good app with plenty of recipes.  The Yummly app is user friendly and has great helpful categories and options to help you search, shop, and links for your recipe needs.  There are a variety of choices when you search, it‚Äôs like searching on google for certain recipes.  I definitely recommend this app if you need food ideas like I do.  Happy Cooking!"
340,340,5,2018-06-08T18:45:38.000Z,Greamlin,Most used app on my phone!,I love using this app to search for recipes based on my preferences. I also appreciate that i can search for recipes from other sources and find them they Yummly. The list function is perfect for creating my shopping list and i love the notifications for when to start cooking based on when I‚Äôve scheduled the meal. Thank you for such an amazingly functional tool!
341,341,5,2018-06-17T15:15:08.000Z,nikafee,Easy app,"It‚Äôs just been about a week, but I‚Äôm loving this app already. I find it very easy to search for recipes, customize your search and then most importantly get to the recipe with minimal clicks. Unlike Pinterest when you save pins, it takes several clicks and scrolls before you actually get to the nuts and bolts of the recipe I will be using this instead of Pinterest.  So glad I took a leap and downloaded."
342,342,5,2018-07-05T13:02:33.000Z,Djharden,Excellent,"This is my go-to find-anything recipe ‚Äúbook‚Äù. Everything I‚Äôve tried has been delicious, since I have such good taste, and the filters keep out anything I‚Äôd rather not eat. It makes being a vegetarian easy when it comes to hunting recipes with specific ingredients. I‚Äôve never been disappointed! A really great and helpful app. Thanks for offering this and all the good work you‚Äôve put into it."

I love surprising my mom with the food I make, and the recipes are pretty easy to use. There‚Äôs helpful features like search filters and the Yum‚Äôd feature that make it easier to find and save exactly what your looking for. I definitely have a great time cooking and Yummly makes it all the better!"
344,344,5,2019-02-09T18:32:35.000Z,Foyzboy,The great one says,I have been using this app for about a month and love how you can look up things from ingredients that you have and also whatever you‚Äôre needs are for diet or healthy eating and the shopping list helps me out when searching for things to cook in the future. I love how the scheduling works also to remind me to start preparing so my dinners aren‚Äôt to late for my family.
345,345,4,2019-03-19T14:15:28.000Z,person with many allergies,Hard to figure out at first,"Once I figured out how to use the app, it‚Äôs been super helpful at helping me find varied recipes that accommodate my allergies. It also has a feature that you can say you want to use up a certain item in your kitchen and search for recipes using it. But that‚Äôs hard for me to use. I think it‚Äôs because I expect it to be a find recipes based off of what you already have rather than focusing on just one item."
346,346,5,2019-04-08T01:05:21.000Z,Buddy‚Äôs Mama,Yummyly is pure Yum!,This app is pure genius! I love this app. It has helped me continue on my vegan diet and cook so many great recipes. It‚Äôs also helped me come up with great recipes with food that I have had on hand. When I‚Äôve wanted to make something that I used to love when I was just a vegetarian or that I want to make for like a potluck but make vegan I just look up and bam I am sure to find at least 3 recipes. Thank you Yummly keep it up.
347,347,5,2019-09-19T20:30:43.000Z,Prettygal76,I love it,I am able to find great recipes & able to save them. I love that they have dietary categories which provide my precise needs. Thank you for helping me provide new choices of foods to my family. I‚Äôm not a great cook but am able to follow Directions & they turn out great. Yummly as changed my same old menu by providing so many new ideas. And it‚Äôs free except for the pro. I love this & no longer use BigOven!
348,348,5,2021-02-05T14:06:38.000Z,Burbling,Yummly for my tummy,Great app! I find all the recipes I need. I love the layout of ingredients then directions. It‚Äôs my go to all the time. I made Asian wings and brought them to work one day. My co worker loved them so much she slapped me. It was hysterically funny. I thought I did something wrong and she said don‚Äôt ever make something that delicious without warning me because I totally overate these wings. Needless to say I had to make them again.

Especially this year - it has been a real lifesaver. Maybe literally! Plus I hate spending time in a grocery store and this helps me avoid that. We‚Äôre hooked!"

The features are numerous and the pictures make you decide to try more than you started out to find!  Definitely my favorite app and I can‚Äôt wait to promote them once I get my new website completed.  Keep up the GREAT work Yummly!"

Also, as I have recently had to completely change my eating habits due to a major health issue, the ability to fine tune my searches and discover recipes specific to my - now pretty precise - dietary needs is a big plus! Love it!"

I am not thrilled with the search feature, it often serves up diff results on the same search and you can‚Äôt misspell anything. I guess I am a lazy speller since autocorrect. I also don‚Äôt some of the added features, for example when it asks if you made it ? Or want to add items to shopping list. These things just gunk  me up but I understand some people may find them helpful."

It‚Äôs amazing the amount of recipes I was still able to find going from an unrestricted diet to a gluten-free diet. My boyfriend is also a picky eater so that makes things even more difficult. And there‚Äôs still hundreds of recipes I can try cooking for us both. I would recommend this to anyone!

I can find everything I need in this one app. I have even found recipes that are the same as what my mom use to use. If I have a particular vegetable in the refrigerator, like an eggplant and not sure how I am going to use it, I just search ‚Äúeggplant‚Äù and I have a variety of great recipes to use it in. I have never been disappointed with Yummly."

The filters showed a list of various foods with little ‚ÄúX‚Äôs‚Äù next to them. So i hit the X next to Pork thinking I was removing it from the list. But no, I got only pork recipes.  So I found a page finally for ‚ÄúDisliked‚Äù diets, with 2 lists: one side included many ‚Äúveg‚Äù diets but no mention of meat, the other was titled ‚ÄúAllergies‚Äù and had a list including ‚Äúgluten-free‚Äù, ‚Äúpeanut-free‚Äù etc, which made no sense. Perhaps the ‚ÄúDisliked‚Äù heading had no bearing on the sub-headings below it, but by now I‚Äôm unimpressed & unenchanted. Removed it."

I‚Äôd find myself doing the same old meal time after time. Now with this app I can literally put a new meal together with what I have already stocked in my fridge and pantry. If I don‚Äôt have the ingredients on hand the app will ask you questions on what you fancy, such as what meat do you want to eat to how many ingredients you would like to use."

The app has made my day. It has improved the pantry and it‚Äôs about to improve my skills in the kitchen and save me a LOT of money."

The scanning of ingredients is cool and works so well that it is faster than typing them. I appreciate the ability to adjust the recipe for number of servings especially since we recently had to make large batches for a church dinner. Love that Yummly is alway updating their program and how easy it is to customize for my family.

With any kind of cooking time. Any kind of particular type.

I have thousands of recipes on deck, organized into many categories. I once lost access to my account and did nothing for two days because the world lost meaning. Thankfully, I made a new account and life is great again."

However, I hate the new chef inspired meals that you only get if you pay for the premium version. I don‚Äôt particularly care if they want to include those as part of the premium package, but don‚Äôt casually slip them into my recommendations as if they are available for me to look at only to then tell me that I have to upgrade to get them."

If I find a particular item that looks too good to pass up or new to me, I do a quick search and find a meal using it. And the shopping list feature allows me to roam the market in search of other items without worrying that I spent too much time socializing and forgetting items for the meal."

Only because, sometimes the websites don‚Äôt look that great on mobile and they‚Äôre harder to follow when I‚Äôm in the middle of cooking. Or if I‚Äôm grocery shopping with the shopping list feature and want to take a glance at the cooking process to consider alternatives!"

When I don‚Äôt know what to fix for dinner out comes the IPad to search. I came on here now to search for a baked Ziti that I had made before and it was wonderful.

I‚Äôve also noticed I can‚Äôt search for multiple items, like potatoes and green cabbage, without pulling up sweet potato recipes and/or recipes with just cabbage. I belong to a food coop so cooking revolves around whatever I get in my share. Thanks for reading!"

I used to be able to limit the recipes to only display ones with 10 or less grams of carbs and since one of the updates I can‚Äôt find that feature anymore.  Any hints would be greatly appreciated! I used that heavily since I do a Keto diet!

I will say that it would be better if I could narrow the search results when I try to find recipes for what I have already. There‚Äôs a surprising amount of recipes on how to simply make rice and is annoying to sift through."

Then the directions are not listed in the app, like a normal recipe is expected to have... ya know ingredients then instructions directly below ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I don‚Äôt get it. Really pitiful arrangement to instead re-direct all users, EVERY SINGLE TIME to a recipe blog website. I don‚Äôt have time to read through blogs to figure out where recipes are at when some bloggers hide them. Disappointed with Yummly‚Äôs setup."

It‚Äôs one of my most often used apps but there are still a few features missing. One was actually just implemented though and I‚Äôm happy to see this!  It‚Äôs the sort collection feature. Yes!  I wanted forever to be able to see my collections alphabetically and now I can.

After going through the filters on a recipe, everything stops working. The recipe won‚Äôt open and I can‚Äôt get anything to work. At first I thought it was my screen, but after reinstalling the old version, which works, I know it‚Äôs the app itself. I can see that a lot of new features have been added and I really want to use it. Please fix it for me. Thanks."
389,389,2,2019-09-14T00:55:08.000Z,Clanfiggler,Worked Great until the latest upgrade,"I can still see the recipes I saved, but I can‚Äôt touch any recipe without the APP freezing up.  It‚Äôs also quite annoying to have the ‚Äúpro‚Äù pictures starting to overwhelm the others.  It would be great if you could either allow me to turn the pro recipes off, since I won‚Äôt be able to see them, or put them in a special place.  I know that probably doesn‚Äôt fit in with your marketing strategy, but it is likely to drive me to stop using what was a useful and interesting app."

I am vegan and the app only shows foods I will eat. Other apps I have used don‚Äôt filter as well. I also like searching a certain ingredient I have to find a recipe I can use it in. Only issue is a lot of recipes do not have reviews and I like to hear reviews before trying a new recipe.

I felt the dessert section was lacking and I was disappointed to scroll through over 100 recipes for pumpkin and apple spice. I would rate this app five stars if a feature is built to incorporate all my recipes from my bookmarks and Pinterest into Yummly. I would use this app everyday.

409,409,1,2019-10-09T13:45:38.000Z,Cardkillah,Terrible UI/UX,"The pictures are great, and initially seems very appealing, but the actual usability is terrible. Try to find a recipe you like, and then add it to a saves list or collection. Guarantee for 1st time users takes you more than 5 minutes. Since, that's a main focal point of the app, that should be a red flag for whomever designed it. Make it easier to add recipes to lists--not just add ingredients for shopping. Make it more clear cut on organizing recipes, and categories. Tried to like and utilize the app more than once, and it's they try to over do it. Much better apps out there for organizing and finding recipes."

Beautiful app with helpful suggestions and ideas based on your dining preferences and diet.  This is my go to app for everything.  My husband enjoys telling everyone how he‚Äôs rushing home for a dinner that is so much better than dining out.  Thanks, Yummly.  You made it all possible!"
411,411,4,2021-02-06T17:08:16.000Z,Sambino495,Update has made this app frustrating,I‚Äôve used this app for a couple of years now and appreciate being able to save recipes and find new things to cool every so often. I don‚Äôt use this app as much as I used to simply because every time you open the app it now asks if you want to get Yummly pro. Stop asking me that every time I open the app! It also feels like it crashes more than it used to.
412,412,5,2020-11-01T16:39:30.000Z,healthyishmom,Keeps me organized!,"In the overwhelming world of food blogs, this site allows me to keep it all straight. It provides inspiration for whatever ingredients you have on hand and gives you a way to save all your favorites in neat folders. Best of all, when you have it open while cooking, it stays active (doesn‚Äôt dim) I use this site at least once daily."
413,413,5,2020-07-17T17:39:23.000Z,Carynbreslin,I freaking love this app!!!,"Yummly is my favorite cooking app!! So many awesome recipes!! Plus if you are needing specific diet needs like allergic to dairy, gluten, vegan, &/or vegetarian they show you only what you want to see!!! They also have a cool trick about if you don‚Äôt know what you want to make but have a few specific items in you fridge of cub bard they can create a recipe from the items you have!!! LOVE THIS APP!!!!"
414,414,5,2020-06-13T22:01:49.000Z,McArthurS,I love this app!,"I love Yummly. I am newly married and love trying out new meals and so far my experience has been great. I've been using this app for 9 months and usually do at least one Yummly meal a week. I've only found 1 bad recipe and the rest have been delicious. I have introduced this app to multiple people and they love it as well. If you like trying new recipes, this is the app for you!"
415,415,4,2020-07-01T14:28:07.000Z,plantfoodie,Yummly,"I really love the convenience of being able to store recipes from many different sources, but recently the app has asked me to update every time I enter the app.  I have tried deleting and reloading and this is not helping.  It‚Äôs very frustrating especially when I‚Äôm in the middle of making a recipe. Please fix the problem because I miss the convenience and the frustration is starting to outweigh the convenience."
416,416,5,2020-03-27T18:11:18.000Z,B-Mang,Yumming This App!,I do a lot of cooking and will try about anything in the kitchen. My mother was a French Cooking Instructor years ago as a hobby and I‚Äôve always eaten amazing food. So since I likely wouldn‚Äôt find a girlfriend who liked cooking as much as my mom I had to learn on my own. Now I do a lot of the cooking. The app I simple and intuitive to use and saving a recipe for later is a snap. Keep up the good work.
417,417,5,2020-03-19T02:04:13.000Z,MaisieBe,Easy to navigate,"I have had opportunity to make a couple of recipes and I like the ease of navigation on the app. Also, I have the ability to update preferences. I‚Äôve recently decided to eat more vegetarian meals, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I could update my preferences. There is also the ability to adjust allergens - since discoveries are made every day!"
418,418,5,2020-03-15T00:01:16.000Z,senior chef,Yummly for recipes.,I‚Äôm recently retired and have always enjoyed cooking. With my wife still working for a couple years I have been doing the daily cooking. Yummly helps me every day plan a great meal. Tonight I searched chicken breasts and picked Melt in your mouth Chicken Breasts. Simple ingredients I had. Meal turned out great. When you search there are so many choices you will find one that you want to try. Great App
419,419,2,2020-03-17T21:12:56.000Z,eci1235,It‚Äôs okay,This app is kinda weird it does not actually have the directions on the app and you have to go to google to make the dish. A problem with going to google is the amount of pop-up adds there are and I have to scroll all the way to the bottom. Also when I‚Äôm reading a review of a dish on the actual app it gets really stiff and won‚Äôt let me read the second review. But I do think it is a decent app if you just want a place to find recipes and store them as well as keeps a shopping list 4/10 IF COST MONEY I WOULD NOT BUY!!!!
420,420,4,2018-05-09T05:37:25.000Z,vanessa green,Yummly review,So many recipes. So many ideas tips and opportunities to purchase equipment. Even if you can‚Äôt afford to buy their offers of differant things if your a beginner cook like me you can see different options of things you need or can use to do specific kitchen tasks any buy a cheaper version elsewhere only complaint is some of the directions have measurements I‚Äôm not familiar with. Like 1 ‚Äújigger‚Äù but learning is part of the fun.
421,421,5,2018-05-18T20:41:40.000Z,Itzy S.,Best app I‚Äôve found,I‚Äôve used a few other apps to look for recipes but Yummly seems to be the only one with easy and delicious recipes. The app even allows you to add ingredients from your fridge to the search! It‚Äôs super useful! I also use the grocery list frequently because it tells you what recipe the ingredients are used in so I can plan out my purchases accordingly.
422,422,5,2018-12-15T18:05:46.000Z,deelynn123,Makes family meal planning easy,"I love that I can pick recipes for the week and compile a quick shopping list. I hate to cook, but have taken the responsibility from my husband for a while. This app has made it possible for me to plan meals for the week, shop, and made them in advance efficiently. I am normally stressed about meal planning and cooking, but this app has taken the stress out."
423,423,5,2019-01-02T22:59:00.000Z,Sarahchell,My first go-to for all recipe needs,You can literally find any recipe you could imagine on this app. Usually several variations of each recipe. I absolutely LOVE this app and use it daily! I‚Äôve found several new favorites by going through the daily suggestions. I love that you can search by ingredient and even nationality (daughters project for school). Even my dads go-to for dinner ideas now.
424,424,5,2019-02-08T05:39:13.000Z,Barinumber1,Amazing all-around!,"Great photos (makes you hungry looking at them), wonderful variety of foods, and I love how they give you all the nutrition facts, and allow comments on the bottom. They help with modifications you can make or reviews of the outcome of the recipe. Also, a very cool feature is that you can tell it what you have in your fridge and it‚Äôll give you recipes for it."

426,426,5,2019-07-07T19:15:40.000Z,Brytn3i,Love this app!,"A mobile cookbook, I love it! You can save recipes right through the app, they have recipes that are kid friendly (especially helpful for moms or pick eaters). I also like that you can filter ingredients and take pictures and the videos they have. Also the built in grocery list for the recipe you‚Äôre going to cook. This app is the best. I have it on phone, iPad and laptop!! üëçüèº"
427,427,5,2019-06-23T19:45:54.000Z,Angie Orr2,Great. There are endless recipes to choose from.,"I love this app! Finally I can keep all of my recipes in one place and I have an endless supply of new ones. It enables me to search for new things to make based on ingredients I have in hand, dietary restrictions, particular recipes, or if I‚Äôm just looking around. I love it. If you‚Äôre a novice cook or always in the kitchen you should check this out!"
428,428,5,2020-09-19T15:59:52.000Z,Jaystia,Great Recipe Collections,"Recipes are like clothes to me, I don‚Äôt want to use the same ones too many times in a row.  I am constantly searching for new and interesting recipes to try.  Using this app has helped me save a whole lotta time otherwise spent coming up with keywords to direct me to JUST the right site for JUST the right recipe for JUST the right meal/ingredient preference/cooking time/etc."
429,429,1,2020-08-17T00:32:38.000Z,Hucky65,"Yummly, getting worse with every release","I used to look forward to my daily Yummly time, great ideas, great photos, but over the past several months it has been coming up very short of expectation. First, after the last two updates, most recipes have no pictures come up, just a black screen. Then as if that isn‚Äôt bad enough, when you look up recipes, many do not even come up with a result... or it is missing many versions of the Yummly of a year ago. I am starting to try and find other alternatives, I really hope they get their app together soon."
430,430,4,2018-06-10T15:08:07.000Z,cconway22,Yums popularity icon too small,I love the app but the little number icon that shows how popular a recipe is is what too small or the font is just too light to see very well. It would also be really handy to filter those recipes by most popular.
431,431,5,2020-06-10T17:02:44.000Z,KuonsCafe,Wonderful App!,"I can‚Äôt tell you how much this app has helped me and my family. Not only are the recipes abundant and clear to follow. But, they can easily be found for people who have gluten allergies, dairy allergies, vegan or vegetarian preferences and for everyday folks. So I want to thank the team and contributors at Yummly. You have helped make our lives adventures as well as a little yummy. 10/10!"
432,432,5,2020-04-30T18:09:49.000Z,Aamrsh,Great App during pandemic,"Since I‚Äôve been home conducting Distance Learning, I look forward to cooking! My husband is considered the ‚Äúchef‚Äù of the house (he‚Äôs an excellent cook), but this app provides many recipes with the ingredients that I have on hand. My daughter and husband have been giving me two thumbs up! I also pay attention to the reviews, which have really helped."
433,433,5,2020-03-25T15:58:42.000Z,sutherland2,It‚Äôs all there,"I love to browse this place. So many choices. Now you can watch chefs cook. I pay attention to each recipe reviews, why because the recipes are from all over and not all are great. Most are but you can sure look at one recipe and see at least 10 more then choose. I like to add my review after making one as I rely on the reviews. Enjoy I do."
434,434,3,2020-04-20T05:21:51.000Z,TSJ921,What happened?,"This use to be the best app ever.  It was updated and now I have to sign in every time I want to use it to get me saved recipes. It is a pain whenever I want to quickly use the app, and I have to type a name and a password. I do not need all the extra like some people . I want to open the app, save a recipe, or use search to find a receipt. I would really like the simpler app you once had before theses last two updates. The app, to me, is not as user friendly."
435,435,5,2019-10-22T18:14:49.000Z,Mrs. V-Viddles,Great Selection of Recipes!,"Easy app to use, great selection, love the filters and store list options! I spend way too much time on this app, but it‚Äôs a rewarding experience and pays off at mealtimes! No matter if you‚Äôre looking for variety, easy and fast, something new, a challenging recipe, a certain number of ingredients....name it, you‚Äôre most likely gonna find it right here."

Not all are winners, but if you do dig around you will indeed find some gems. And boy are there some gems‚Ä¶ (search for inside out chocolate chip cookies - holy schinkes) Like any cooking venture, find a recipe you like and modify it until it‚Äôs perfect! I‚Äôll be back again and again. Thanks for this amazing resource!!"

I tap Yum but the option to further organize my recipes into Dinner, Breakfast, and so forth no longer shows up and I can‚Äôt find out how to organize my recipes at all. I‚Äôve tried searching online and trying ever button on the app but no luck."
438,438,5,2020-11-16T22:46:50.000Z,Megalistical,Great for food allergies,"If you have foods you need to avoid , this app is perfection!"
439,439,5,2020-07-08T17:58:09.000Z,ddfishhh,Seriously the best cooking/recipe app!,"This app is super well-organized, which is a huge plus if you‚Äôre constantly trying to learn a new recipe. You can save them into different folders, which makes it so much easier having to look for it later on. Not to mention it literally has every recipe you could think of! Just the best!"
440,440,4,2019-02-25T04:45:18.000Z,Homeskillybiscuit,Doesn‚Äôt work from suggestions in email,I love this app and use it often but it simply doesn‚Äôt work from the suggestions they send you in the emails. It‚Äôs so frustrating to click on a recipe from within an email or try to Yum it and it just doesn‚Äôt work. It sends you out of the browser or wants you to log in to the app and then you completely lose the recipe you were on. Grrrr
441,441,5,2019-03-21T13:52:07.000Z,Skatin Palace Bx,Joe Ames,There are so many recipes to chose from its incredible. From beginner to expert. Whatever your cooking skills are you can go wrong with this app. The fact that you can download all your ingredients while looking for a meal to make is awesome. It‚Äôs so cool to have. My friends and family are impressed with my cooking skills. I recommend this app to everyone I know cause everyone loves to eat.
442,442,5,2020-05-27T20:46:49.000Z,KSDoggett,My go to site for cooking and baking!,"I have so many cook books, but I find myself going to Yummly anytime I want to cook and bake later. My family and I have loved the recipes I have tried and the advice from other users for adjustments they have made along the way. I have used a few recipes multiple times already. And it‚Äôs very user friendly."
443,443,5,2020-05-25T15:05:28.000Z,badgernick3,Great app to have for anyone,"I‚Äôm a college student, so I really enjoy being able to look for quick meal recipes and mixed drinks that I can make with the ingredients I have lying around. The app also tries to pick out meals that you like which is nice if I‚Äôd like to make a really nice meal. I can also save favorites and mark down ingredients I need for my shopping list right in the app."
444,444,5,2020-04-30T20:22:30.000Z,care211,Great meta site,I enjoy Yummly because it compiles all the sites I want to search but don‚Äôt have time to keep up with. By using Yummly I get to find new interesting recipe tailored to my preferences. I also like that I can search one site and get several options for a specific dish I want to cook. I enjoy looking at them all and taking the best pieces to make a version that is tailored to me.
445,445,5,2020-04-19T14:28:43.000Z,JRB Ohio,Obsessed,"I love Yummly. I have been using the desktop version and the app for years. It helps me to find recipes that meet my dietary preferences and gives me suggestions that I always love. It‚Äôs easy to share recipes with friends, prep for the store, make an ingredient substitution and really any convenience I need. Not to mention site and app are beautiful!! I recommend this app to everyone."

I'm deleting all of the others. This app is amazing!! One thing I would like to have is some kind of interface-a simple, quick way to add items to my Kroger/Smith's shopping list. One day! Thanks for making life more deliriously easy."
447,447,5,2020-01-28T20:49:21.000Z,Shamecca Stephens,Absolutely Love the App !,This app is awesome! You can easily select your meals ! Plan them out for what days you will have them and create and send a shopping list to your local grocery store üè¨! This is a huge weekly time saver using this app plus the app being able to easily connect to your grocery store and add the needed ingredients to your shopping list !!! Love it !!!
448,448,3,2019-11-20T02:12:35.000Z,Shantygal,Crashing Problem,"Love the easy access to a plethora of recipes from numerous foodies, the tools to create shopping lists, and the ability to search for recipes per ingredient. Unfortunately, after the site was updated, it continually crashes when I try to do anything other than the preliminary search for a recipe. The screen freezes and it‚Äôs not my iPad. Is there any way to fix this issue? Otherwise, when it works, this is a five-star site."
449,449,2,2019-10-09T12:36:20.000Z,PokiPomi,Out with the old...in with the problems.,"The Yummly app used to be amazing in helping me with finding recipies for years. Being in a culinary class, finding reliable recipes can be hard. Ever since the app was updated and I was forced to install a new app (since the old one apparently was discontinued), I have had nothing but problems. I have tried clearing the cache, logging out and logging back in, uninstalling and reinstalling but as soon as I open the app and tap on a recipe it freezes up before I can even see open it."
450,450,4,2018-03-13T23:46:25.000Z,robertblamb,Great stuff! One of the best meal planning apps.,"Only suggestion I would make is to better organize the grocery list. I hate seeing the exact measurements because it confuses me - it would be more reasonable to just write ‚Äúone lime‚Äù or ‚Äúalmond meal‚Äù, but I can see that other people would feel the opposite. It‚Äôs such a great app the recipes are genuinely yummy!!! A lot of apps similar don‚Äôt have yummy goods - just weird concoctions. I‚Äôm a vegan and this has helped my transition a ton."
451,451,5,2018-05-08T04:36:21.000Z,MTC76,I got my entire family hooked!,I have a huge family with various level of busy and cooking skill. We were talking about it over the holidays and I mentioned the app. The parents in my family loved it. The kids go through and pick out what they like...less mealtime bickering plus the kids get excited and want to be involved with making the meal.
452,452,4,2018-10-01T01:07:43.000Z,Samovar222,Great meal planning app!,"Super helpful, well organized and easy to use. Massive database of recipes. Love the calendar link and shopping lists."
453,453,5,2018-10-28T20:59:54.000Z,DianeS500,Really love this app.,Lots of good recipes. You can adjust for # of servings and even lets you know when to start what so things are ready at the same time. I‚Äôve used this for meals every night last week and really love how easy it is to use. Comments from people who have already tried recipes really helpful as well for any tweaks you may want to make.
454,454,5,2019-01-07T11:28:34.000Z,Michelle GV,Nice Recipe App,"This app compares very favorably to the Epicurious app.  Gorgeous pictures, nice display. The only drawback In my book is that it is slightly clunky to search. You have to go back and forth between screens in order to do so.   Least ways, I think it could be a little bit more intuitive than it is. Otherwise I have already made some good meals from it!"
455,455,5,2020-12-10T02:09:00.000Z,Matermama,Best ever!!,I have been using yummly for years now because it is so easy to use and has the most diverse recipes in one place and the most ways to plan a meal! I use it for holidays and parties and people are always wowed! It‚Äôs makes it easy to make a dinner in under 20 min or you can customize how much time and ingredients ways you want to cook and so much more!! It‚Äôs the best!! Ever!
456,456,1,2020-12-23T03:36:33.000Z,Schickelstein,iPad: app won‚Äôt allow me to sign into my account,"This is now the second version of the Yummly app for iPad that won‚Äôt allow me to sign into my existing account.  I can‚Äôt access my saved recipes, etc.   When I open the app, I am invited to create a new account, which is silly because I already have one.  There is no option to sign into an existing account.  That rates a ‚Äú0 stars‚Äù from me, but when I try to create a new account I get the message ‚ÄúOops, something went wrong‚Äù.   Altough the lowest allowed rating is 1 star, if it were possible I would give this app a negative 1."

It also gives me great inspiration for new dishes and ideas. The shopping tab that allows tracking of ingredients needed for each recipe comes in handy and I can manually add or eliminate items as necessary. My go to cooking app!"
458,458,5,2020-09-01T19:15:59.000Z,PRJ50,My go-to recipe source,Yummly is just what you‚Äôre looking for; a goldmine of recipes! You can search for specific ingredients or methods of preparation. I love the variety. It is often the first place I look when I want to try something new. My only complaint is that the nutritional information is not always accurate because the servings aren‚Äôt included.
459,459,4,2020-09-09T23:04:10.000Z,Se√±orita mittens,Love it.,"I use Yummly often and they should pay me for advertising by how often I recommend it. Great filters. I wish there was a way ( Maybe there is and I‚Äôm missing it) to save favorites I want to repeat. I also hate that if I have a recipe up, it doesn‚Äôt stay there so I have to re-find it."
460,460,5,2020-05-27T03:22:22.000Z,kjshep,Use all the time,Easy to find great recipes and a very user friendly app. I like the recommendations they send you because they are spot on with what I like. I like the reviews and number of likes because it can help filter through recipes faster. My favorite part is that you can search for recipes based on what you have in your kitchen.
461,461,3,2020-08-23T16:12:15.000Z,Mark Cuckerberg,Almost unusable without Facebook,"If you don't have Facebook, don't even bother. The app won't stop prompting you to sign in with your Facebook account."
462,462,5,2020-04-30T04:07:29.000Z,BA1452,My favorite meal planning app!,"So many ways to personalize and schedule meals, nice grocery list feature. I‚Äôm a working mom that feels behind all the time but this app helps me stay on top of our weekly meals. I organize the week‚Äôs meals and schedule them onto our family‚Äôs shared calendar then easily share the grocery list with my husband to do the shopping."

Great app, have already recommended to family and friends!"
464,464,4,2020-04-16T00:17:41.000Z,tydhu CB isi,Love it (mostly),Love having all recipes in one place. Sometimes the links to directions don‚Äôt work and that can be frustrating. Love when there are embedded reviews from users on recipes but sometimes those seem to be missing or maybe folks just are not using the feature. Also love that you can create a shopping list or a meal from what you have available
465,465,5,2020-01-06T03:03:07.000Z,jenniej5o,I love this app!,"I have looked at a lot of recipe and meal planning apps and this one is the one that works the best for me.  This app has dietary preferences like gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, etc.  I can save recipes I like to my own ‚Äúfolders ‚Äú.  AND...I can schedule a recipe for a certain day/time!  It fits right into my phone‚Äôs calendar and alerts me when it‚Äôs time to start prepping, etc. I love this app! It‚Äôs a win for me."

467,467,5,2019-09-26T12:58:43.000Z,Kellypurifoy,Perfect,"I struggle getting ideas for dinners. That‚Äôs why I got the app. I didn‚Äôt realize it had SO much more than that, breakfasts, sides, drinks, there‚Äôs seasonal stuff, you can choose many options for your dietary needs. This app is amazing. I refer it to everyone who asks me for ideas. The best part, they have a ‚Äúkid friendly‚Äù option. My 2 year old is in her picky phase and this is wonderful!"

469,469,5,2019-07-30T18:26:28.000Z,Markercrayon7,Fantastic for everything!,This app has made my life significantly easier. Every recipe I have made from this app has been amazing. It categorizes recipes by different types of food and it provides recipes based on food interests and avoids foods you dislike! This app also includes a category for kid-friendly food which also has significantly boosted my rating.
470,470,4,2018-03-25T18:02:50.000Z,ljs traveler,Yummly would get a 5 star rating if...,"If, via the emails or the app, I would be able to get the ingredients and directions to fit in 1 screen shot, I would love Yummly. When I select print, it doesn‚Äôt give a clear screen shot. I‚Äôm not always near a printer when I‚Äôm perusing the recipes. Otherwise, I have found new, more interesting recipes that have definitely been family pleasing, ie:"
471,471,5,2018-07-15T19:42:53.000Z,rhmarie,Love this app,Love the amount of recipes and have made quite a few. Some I tweaked for my family and some were exactly on the mark. But I think that‚Äôs what makes a great recipe... it can be adapted for you.
472,472,4,2018-10-24T15:08:10.000Z,EgypteAnari,Amazing but short a few features,I love this app as you can find recipes anywhere and upload them to yummily if someone hasn‚Äôt already. It‚Äôs all your favorite recipe sites in one!
473,473,5,2018-12-05T17:09:47.000Z,Miss Mechanic,Absolutely Amazing!,"I got this app not expecting a lot, but it‚Äôs been super helpful and has delicious recipes on it. I love how it helps you create a shopping list, and also allows you to buy kitchen appliances/utensils online, and the prices are fairly cheap, too! My boyfriend and I have made a couple dishes using this app, and so far we love it! My mom and his mom also find it interesting"
474,474,5,2018-12-16T19:57:17.000Z,Slickstarr,Phenomenal,"I‚Äôm a meal delivery service addict.  But this does it for you when you prefer to cook, it lets you save the recipe, But the best part is it takes you to another app that downloads the grocery stores in your area and I helps make a grocery list giving you the exact ingredients you need to buy to make that recipe at that store.  Easy. No forgetting anything!"
475,475,4,2019-01-05T06:40:02.000Z,goodthingscoming,So fun! And a little glitchy with the ads sometimes,Beautiful pictures and easy to use format for the most part. Love the diversity of recipes available. It makes searching for something easy! I don‚Äôt really like the way it makes you go to a recipe‚Äôs original blog page and then you have to deal with all the advertisements and glitches that come from them to get the directions.
476,476,5,2019-04-27T18:50:09.000Z,Micah Heins,Best Recipe App Online,"Absolutely LOVE YUMMLY!!  This application takes recipes from all over the web, and puts them in one place! I‚Äôm organized, and can find my favorite recipes from my favorite sites!!  Plus you can, search, browse most popular, rate them, and make a grocery list!!! Thanks to Yummly, I‚Äôve gotten out of the ‚Äúsame meal slump‚Äù and made some amazing food for my family!!!"
477,477,5,2020-11-05T21:42:27.000Z,NBelle13,"Great app, wonderful recipes, however it could have better search options","Great app for tons or recipes. It could have better search options for techniques and recognize multiple definitions of a word in a recipe, such as when searching  butternut squash ‚Äúpasta‚Äù it gave fewer options than when I entered something specific like butternut squash ‚Äúlasagna‚Äù."
478,478,2,2021-01-03T17:45:01.000Z,Aajramirez,"Buyer beware, Used to be my go to for recipes",I used to Love this app. Just wish there was more ethnic food options. I‚Äôve had this app for a few years now and it‚Äôs since been converted to a pay for service kind of app I‚Äôm so sad to see it go this way. They should have kept it free for those of us that have been loyal. Also I don‚Äôt understand why they are charging if the recipes come from actual users and different areas from the internet. I will just stick to google and actual cookbooks from now on.
479,479,3,2020-07-24T00:57:00.000Z,Phatcelica2000,Dropped from 5 star to 3,I love the Yummly app and have used it extensively for a couple years now. I rated it 5 star but have changed that to 3 today simply because the shopping list does not tell you how much of the ingredients you need. Kinda hard to know how much of something to buy based on your list. I‚Äôm pretty sure the app used to have how much of each ingredient in the shopping list. Please update the app to show how much is needed in the shopping list.
480,480,4,2018-11-11T13:07:57.000Z,kateismynickname,Great app!,Pros:
481,481,5,2018-11-11T20:03:59.000Z,LylaMariesmommy,Best app ever for meal planning with allergies!,"I'm in love with this app, I can't eat gluten or dairy and I'm able to put in allergies and have only recipes I can eat pop up! Then I can take them off to find recipes for my family. Oh and it has an option to all all of the ingredients to a shopping list or you can pick the ones you need to buy. Saves me so much time!!"
482,482,5,2019-04-09T04:11:34.000Z,JMamaHJM,Awesome app,"I LOVE this app! I use it all the time. Sometimes I follow recipes just how they are, other times I put my own spin on it. I have never been disappointed... Every recipe I have tried has been fantastic. The whole family enjoys the yumminess too!! There are simple recipes as well as more complex ones which makes it great for everyone. Highly recommend!"
483,483,5,2020-06-30T23:49:43.000Z,anneeshka,Healthy home cooked & created,Yummly has been my go to ap for a few years now. I have used the schedule a meal feature and like that is gives you ingredients to shop for a recipe. I also like that I can create my own favorites in a list. There are so many wonderful choices of so many kinds of food! They are a clearinghouse for many chefs.
484,484,5,2020-06-07T20:46:05.000Z,Tiffany J. Kim,Good Way to Find Recipes,"It's been an awesome way to find recipes. My only quibble is that it's a bit tough to use due to it not having buttons properly labeled so I can easily use it with VoiceOver. However, all in all, I have to say that I have been pleased with the app and have been able to find some delicious recipes and new food blogs to follow by using this app."
485,485,5,2019-11-18T15:18:41.000Z,Bluegardenia777,It is the best,"Wow! Where do I begin. This app has been my lifeline to cooking. Who needs a cookbook when you have Yummly. Unfortunately my phone screen gets really dirty because my food stained fingers are all over it but this app has ‚Äúeverything ‚Äú. I just put in a buzz word and up a recipe comes. I‚Äôm bragging on you guys to anyone who will listen. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you."
486,486,3,2020-05-12T05:46:51.000Z,Just want garnet,It‚Äôs okay,I enjoy Yummly a lot though I have a few gripes.
487,487,4,2020-04-07T12:57:13.000Z,Sydney renea,Love it but having some issues,"I love this app, its so easy to find recipes, set cook times so you can get dinner done on time and create shopping list. The issue I have been having recently is that the app isn‚Äôt loading when click to open it. It shows an icon of a pot with steam coming out but that‚Äôs it. It never loads after that, hope you guys will be able to fix this bug."
488,488,3,2020-03-16T23:58:51.000Z,SeaTea21,I used to love this,"I no longer love Yummly since they upgraded and created a two step login.  I now have to click the button to logon using iPhone, open an email they send, then click the link in the email.   I have to do this every time I want to use the app.  I do still love the integration Yummly has with scheduling onto my calendar and downloading the shopping list onto my regular shopping list. And of course, I love finding the awesome recipes that suit our tastes."
489,489,4,2021-03-13T17:12:24.000Z,K06,Love the App but needs Air Fry option,This app is great. When I first downloaded it their was an option to look for air fryer recipes. But awhile ago that option disappeared in techniques. Please bring it back. That is basically how I cook everything now. I know a lot of people who are looking for ways to find more air fryer recipes. Bring that back you it gets 5 stars
490,490,5,2021-01-27T23:51:00.000Z,sk8proksl,Something for everyone,"I‚Äôve loved using Yummly and its my first go-to when looking for a recipe. It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter if I have something specific in mind or if I need to search based on a couple of items I have on hand, I always find a recipe. The app is simple to use and handy to have right there on my phone to follow as I‚Äôm cooking."
491,491,5,2020-10-21T13:25:12.000Z,xrae00,The vegan recipes are great,"I really like how I can choose dietary preferences and they are the ones that show up always, even in the emails sent."
492,492,4,2020-12-21T17:53:36.000Z,tonic1775,Great app,"It‚Äôs really a great app. I only have one minor quibble and that‚Äôs when I receive emails with recipes I might like, whenever I click on the link it doesn‚Äôt take me to the recipe. It takes me to the homepage and I end up having to search for the recipe. Sometimes I find it, sometimes I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a little frustrating. Otherwise, if I‚Äôm just searching for recipes on my own it‚Äôs a fantastic tool."
493,493,3,2020-12-08T02:03:44.000Z,kb1ibt,Used to be good,"This app used to be our go to recipe app, but it has been getting progressively worse. There are now times where 6-8 recipes in a row are the same thing just different interpretations. Also they are really trying to force the use of Yummly Pro, in fact as I was scrolling though I just had 18 recipes in a row that were from Yummly Pro."
494,494,5,2020-09-27T02:49:31.000Z,Elizabeth126,Love!,Great app! Makes it easy to try all kinds of recipes. It's nice to try something new once in a while or needing a cookbook or tracking something down on the Internet and printing it  out at work and bringing it home from work to make. The other nice thing is that having the recipe on my phone means that I am never guessing at my amount of ingredients.
495,495,5,2020-09-11T20:16:06.000Z,Hialeah Girl 73,Variety and Ease of Use,I started using Yummly a few months back to come up with more dinner ideas.  I love how easy it is to use.  I‚Äôve been able to find any level of recipe and no matter what I‚Äôm looking for there are so many different options.   I used to go to Food Network to find recipes but now I automatically go to Yummly.  Love it!!
496,496,5,2020-08-10T19:40:44.000Z,SweetElegy,Great App for my recipes,"My mother had all her recipes on 3x4 index cards - we have come a long way! I don‚Äôt cook often, but when I do I benefit from the organization, access, and tutorials offered by Yummly.  I particularly like the ability to put in  a list of the ingredients I have on hand and see what possibilities come up on my screen.  Awesome and easy to use."
497,497,5,2020-06-23T15:36:42.000Z,truthnowandsemper,Very helpful,"Yummly is a great app for anyone to use! It has a large variety of recipes for cooks from amateurs to professional chefs. The fact that you can save and categorize recipes to use again is super convenient and time saving! I love the ‚Äúsuggested‚Äù page because it‚Äôs a cool way to find new recipes to try as well. All in all, I would rate this app a 10/10!"
498,498,4,2020-02-21T18:54:44.000Z,illusions37,Like trying new things,I enjoy reading your recipes each day.  I get new ideas of what to cook and how to do it.  The gluten free items I have made have been very tasty.  Recipes are varied and the directions easy to follow.  Thank you.
499,499,1,2020-04-12T15:22:17.000Z,Super annoyed 0219,App doesn‚Äôt open,I downloaded and used once. Thought it was great I saved a bunch of recipes and started tuning my recommendations. I wanted to check out my saved recipes before I went grocery shopping by the app never finishes loading. I closed and tried again... I turned my phone off and tried again... I did an iOS update and tried again nothing works to make the app load so I can use it... a developer response would be great.. I‚Äôm going to uninstall and try one more time if the app doesn‚Äôt remember me with my account log in I will not use again
500,500,5,2018-06-03T01:24:30.000Z,SpiritualWarrior29,Quite pleased,I am a cook that lacks imagination and creativity so this app is a lifesaver. If I have a map drawn out (this app) I will do it but if i have to figure it out on my own it‚Äôs not going to happen. I also love the feature that lets you add random ingredients you have and gives you recipes to make w them. I‚Äôve made 4 recipes in 2 days which is a lot for me
501,501,5,2018-06-28T23:53:01.000Z,Effynoddle,Amazing,"I was searching through the web for a cr√™pe recipe, and there was so many to choose from. My favorite part is when it ask you about your preferences, when looking for a certain dish. It makes it so easy to find something I want, and only gives me options that it knows I will like. If I could I would rate this 6 stars."
502,502,5,2018-07-10T23:11:36.000Z,Gigicooks,Website slow to open,"Love the recipes, but it takes a long time for the website to open, and sometimes I can‚Äôt even get to my saved recipes which is frustrating!! We have great internet service here in metro DC and I have a new computer, so it‚Äôs not a network or computer issue. Other websites that I use pop right up."
503,503,4,2018-07-18T15:58:00.000Z,esouder125,Life saving recipes,"Love almost everything about this app. Easy to search. Easy to create preferences and solve for allergies. Tasty results most of the time. Hate having to link to another website for the actual recipe however and endure tons of ads on those sites or broken links or timing out and having to go back in through Yummly. Otherwise, I would use this every day without fault."
504,504,4,2018-12-01T02:56:06.000Z,Shumegma,Great app!,"I would absolutely recommend this app to anyone. It has such a wide variety of recipes and so many choices. Sometimes it‚Äôs kinda slow but that‚Äôs probably due to the amount of pictures and quality of the pictures in the app. Overall, this has recipes I would‚Äôve never thought of and taste amazing; plus it gives me more recipes to experiment with and put my own twist on :)"

I have never been disappointed when searching for just the right dish for the right occasion. Yummly‚Äôs recipe database seems endless, and it‚Äôs search function yields quick, effective results. Who needs a cookbook when you have Yummly?!"

508,508,4,2020-10-18T16:53:04.000Z,Doodler19861133,I like it but not all recipes load,"I really like the idea of this app. You have all the popular blogger recipes all in one, scannable app. This is like AllRecipes but better quality recipes overall."
509,509,4,2020-03-27T20:05:56.000Z,QtrPonderosa,Great App,"Great app for consolidating access to a large volume of recipes.  App needs improvement with regards to social functions, sharing with other users, etc. and IMHO, would benefit greatly by integrating with Amazon's Echo, especially in adding the ability to add shopping list items to the Echo's shopping list.  The social aspect is critical, especially as a means to interact before I make a dish and not after knowing I messed it up."
510,510,5,2019-02-09T16:14:19.000Z,Diane B,Great recipe ideas,"I really like using this app and the ability to search for whatever I want including things like how many things the recipe needs, type of cuisine, the time it takes, ingredients wanted, etc. I also like getting feedback from people who have already used these recipes which I find very helpful."
511,511,5,2019-02-13T14:42:24.000Z,Bodvb14577,Makes you hungry,"I do enjoy this app, it‚Äôs a great way to find all the recipes from around the web and the world in one great spot. Also as well save them to the app to try or make again. It‚Äôs definitely a time saver, so many great options to search for that recipe you‚Äôre looking for or what ingredients you have on hand. 5 stars no doubt"
512,512,5,2019-02-14T03:16:15.000Z,minaali16,Love itttt,It has so many different meals and way to make it for literally all types of diets. It‚Äôs super freaking convenient and like others can comment on it so that they can say any alterations they‚Äôve made if you want their advice and you can see if others liked the recipe. I love it and would definitely recommend especially if you‚Äôre a beginner
513,513,3,2019-05-19T19:30:44.000Z,Konaauthor,Needs work,"The app won‚Äôt rotate with your device, which can be frustrating, and the narratives and directions are poorly written, in terms of grammar and typos. Seems less than professional.... shoddy even. Have made two of the recipes and they were okay; not ‚Äúamazing‚Äù but okay. Wide variety of recipes available, but I‚Äôm not sure this app is really all that helpful: I can just type ‚Äúgrilled pork chop recipes‚Äù into my browser and get much the same thing."
514,514,5,2019-05-23T14:04:37.000Z,NadineB1981,Best app for moms,"This is by far the best app I have found to not only organize my recipes but also search for other AND make my grocery list. It‚Äôs very user friendly and has extras, like allowing you to schedule your dinners and it would send you alerts when it‚Äôs time to start cooking to have dinner ready at a specific time."
515,515,5,2019-09-12T17:15:31.000Z,SavvyShops,LOVE this functional App,"I‚Äôve been doing meal delivery for about 2 years but got tired of eating the same things. Plus it gets pricey. With this app I can find a recipe, and add everything to my shopping list, in the exact amounts, it couldn‚Äôt be easier. I‚Äôm cooking more things and I get more servings with leftovers for less money. Overall I‚Äôm loving this app it‚Äôs s lifesaver!!"
516,516,5,2019-09-11T13:49:23.000Z,EkBisby,Best recipe app,"I love this app. I have had it essentially since it‚Äôs release. I‚Äôm not exactly sure how I found it, but I‚Äôm so glad I did. I deleted all other recipe apps. It‚Äôs great because you also get a visual of what the finished product looks like. It‚Äôs nice to have the tutorials and the shopping list as a bonus. I can‚Äôt tell you how much I enjoy this. I use it regularly."
517,517,5,2019-06-27T12:15:11.000Z,MoreZoe,Very good recipes for the most part,"I‚Äôm not a fan of food trends...just good food, so if there is a rash of kale recipes or the diet-of-the-week recipes, I tend to skip over those.  But I have to say that overall, these are good recipes.  I like recipes that I cook once and know that I want to make again and there are plenty of those.  The app is pretty much flawless.  No complaints!"
518,518,4,2019-08-12T18:30:18.000Z,Scoobydood143,Great! But...,"Love the app! A ton of amazing recipes, the ability to save ones your like, basically it has a bunch of awesome features. The only pain is that it doesn‚Äôt actually include the recipes themselves, just links to them. This can be a huge hassle when the site you‚Äôre linked to is so covered with ads and exposition that you‚Äôve gotta dig around to find the actual recipe on the page."
519,519,5,2019-06-23T16:55:24.000Z,svychop,Great Back Up Plan,"For Me I find Yummly to be a great back u plan, weather I‚Äôm bored with my same old dishes, or just want to try want to make a recipe of mine a little different it is a great source of information to do that with. There‚Äôs hardly ever been a time my family has not liked what I‚Äôve served with the help of Yummly ‚ò∫Ô∏è Like I said It‚Äôs this Mother‚Äôs greatest Back Up Plan"
520,520,5,2017-10-08T14:54:05.000Z,Jodilerea,Yum yum yum,This is one of my favorite apps and I use it often. Love that you can just type in anything your craving and it gives you so many options of how to make it. Easy to use and I love that you can save all the recipes you like in one area so it's easy to find when you make it. I highly recommend this app. for anyone that loves to eat yummy food.
521,521,5,2018-06-28T23:47:10.000Z,Rask_M,Highly Recommend!!,"This app is one of the best ones out there for people who are looking to start eating healthier. Not saying you have to, but it definitely makes it easy to stick with a diet with all of its awesome features and costume food options. Also, the recipes on here are fantastic and always fits with what I would actually want to eat."
522,522,5,2018-09-28T02:50:23.000Z,Mandi The Love Maia,Yummly is my go to dinner app!,"I love Yummly and use it all the time! It helps me store recipes and directions to recipes, dinners I‚Äôve prepared, grocery items, and much more! I can save which dinners I plan to make and which ones I‚Äôve already made (for future planning)...I truly do love this app and love their new feature offering guided recipes (for cooking challenged folks like myself). Thanks Yummly!"
523,523,5,2018-10-28T13:37:30.000Z,sunday chef,Uploading recipes,Totally addicting app!  Is there a way to have the recipe title automatically transfer during upload so it is the first part of the text? Otherwise  I have to type to in after uploading. It helps when searching my recipes without having to open it to see if it‚Äôs the recipe I‚Äôm looking for.
524,524,1,2019-01-11T21:13:45.000Z,hoppy1955,Loved idea but not user friendly,I downloaded the app and it appeared that it was going to be just what I was looking for. But when I open the app and attempted to use it it was the most difficult app I have ever encountered. At every turn I was getting bombarded with request to join or do something other than what I was there to do. I was simply trying to download a recipe which I thought I would like and it was almost impossible To do. Unless you change how your app works by moving on to another App that‚Äôs more user-friendly. I do not recommend this app to anyone
525,525,4,2019-01-22T00:24:23.000Z,bs331467,Great recipe app,"I love the app and really how I can add outside recipes to my favorites.  If I could, I would add some features:  Have a recently added tab so that I can search quickly recipes I‚Äôve placed in my favorites.  The second would be to have some home keeping goods to the list function.  Items I normally buy while shopping for groceries like paper towels and hand soap.  Great app and I can‚Äôt wait to see more come!"
526,526,5,2021-08-06T15:22:33.000Z,Sugarland,Love Yummly,"Out of all of the cooking sites that I am on, Yummly is my favorite! It is my go to site to find whatever I‚Äôm looking for and I love the fact that the organization of my favorites is easy.  I also love that the recipes include the calorie count per serving which is a significant added bonus that I don‚Äôt have to calculate it on my own.  Keep up the great work Yummly!"
527,527,5,2020-12-30T19:17:06.000Z,2LuckyIrish2,Great app.,"It has thousands of recipes, allows you to specify by ingredient, by cuisine, and connects you to a million ideas for what to cook."
528,528,5,2020-08-23T13:35:07.000Z,Swlb127,Really great app!,"I can just throw away all my cookbooks now that I have Yummly. So many recipes with photos and easy to search for what you're looking for. The only difficulty is when you leave the app & go to Directions website, it becomes a little cumbersome. Lots of pop up ads & it jumps around a lot. But overall I really like Yummly!"
529,529,5,2020-05-13T15:16:56.000Z,car$$$pac,Amazing website,I use Yummly to keep our dinner menus ever changing. There are so many quick and easy recipes that meals are never dull. We participate in international night with friends (prior to COVID) and the Yummly site makes it easy to prepare a speciality meal. There are also tons of vegetarian and vegan options available.  So many  different dietary selections right at your fingertips! ENJOY!!
530,530,5,2018-12-09T21:07:46.000Z,Skuts1,Lots of good recipes,"Sometimes I‚Äôm in a rut trying to think of something to make for dinner. I look in my pantry to get an idea of what I have and search through Yummly to find a way to put the ingredients together. I‚Äôve made some pretty good recipes and, as long as the family is happy, they don‚Äôt need to know that I didn‚Äôt come up with the recipe! Keep it up Yummly!"
531,531,5,2019-03-20T21:00:46.000Z,Yzabelbb,Like the ease of creating meals,So far so good. I like how easy and delicious many recipes are. One thing that is hard on my end is finding some of the ingredients but I substitute and it works more than half the time. This app has defiantly made me like cooking because I really don‚Äôt cook due to lack of enjoyment and convenience.... so this is definitely a good change.
532,532,5,2020-04-04T13:12:11.000Z,Pindy Bear,Love the image recognition,"I‚Äôve only had this app for a few days but have used it quite a few times. My favorite feature is the image recognition offering up suggestions for recipes. I like it that you can save recipes by category, I do hope though that they stay available over time."
533,533,5,2019-12-24T19:37:04.000Z,theduck71,"New features make this app, indispensable!","The new features of this app, make it great for cooking. I love the fact that I can add the items needed for a recipe, to my shopping cart, then choose what vendor to use to make the purchase of said items. I can also edit out items that I already have before checking out. Awesome service!"
534,534,5,2019-12-23T14:15:53.000Z,Zari_Kayy,Fav app,I love this app so much for so many different reasons. I was trying to find an app to help me plan dinners for the week and I couldn‚Äôt ask for more with this one right here. It has a huge selection of recipes and the ability to save those recipes to custom made folders. On top of that it can populate a grocery list for you! Truly amazing
535,535,5,2020-12-30T14:29:56.000Z,Shelice,Greatüëçüèº,"I have been using this app for years to find different recipes and have never been disappointed.  You can easily find whatever you are looking for and will also create a shopping list for you right in the app. I highly recommend this app, you will not be disappointed üëçüèº"
536,536,1,2021-01-15T16:31:36.000Z,1737402733,No easy way to reset password,"Thanks for screwing up the app design guys! Now instead of a forgot password button, they offer a ‚Äúsign in through email‚Äù option, which then lets you tap a button on an email to sign in on your phone. However the button doesn‚Äôt work so you can only sign in through the phone browser. When you go to songs to change your password it requires you to enter the old one which you forgot, and if you try to navigate around this it just loops you around and around. Very frustrating!"
537,537,5,2020-12-26T20:30:43.000Z,C/Smoothie,WISH WE COULD IMPORT RECIPES (other than that LOVE IT!!),I wish we could import recipes from websites online. They don‚Äôt have very many instant pot or pressure cooker recipes. Also don‚Äôt have a lot on their keto tag but all in all this is an AMAZING application. (Literally enabled me to go from ordering out every meal to cooking every meal). Love the simple streamlined ingredient lists and easy to save recipes!!
538,538,5,2020-11-06T00:30:06.000Z,Niquie77779,I didn‚Äôt think I would love this app so much,This is by far one of the most used apps I have. The instructions are easy to follow and my family says it feels like they are having restaurant quality food every night. This app makes it so easy to use your basic ingredients in a variety of different ways.
539,539,4,2020-10-03T16:27:33.000Z,Tom Parsley,Yum!,Love the recipes and the variety and the ease of finding the recipe.

My family likes me to switch things up at the dinner table and Yummly provides a variety of recipes. Whether I‚Äôm looking for a seafood dish, pasta, slow cooker meal or a quick 30 minute meal, it's ALL here."
541,541,5,2020-08-11T14:37:23.000Z,Poca5,LOVE YUMMLY ‚ù§Ô∏è,They thought of everything. The pictures are beautiful which makes me want to cook. I finally found an app with healthy meals I want to make. The directions are easy to follow. You can customize the search to include foods you like and omit the ones you don‚Äôt. I love the grocery list option. This will be my go for recipes from now on.
542,542,5,2020-07-09T19:22:47.000Z,PrplHound,Yummy recipes,"I am not creative enough to come up with different ideas for meals.  Yummly has helped me create dishes my family really enjoys!  I like how I can create various folders to keep recipes to each category that‚Äôs easy for me.  Oh, the shopping list is perfect!  Just tick the selected item and it goes to the bottom as ‚Äúgot it‚Äù."
543,543,5,2020-04-15T11:59:14.000Z,Trains4545,Love the app,There are so many things that I love about this app! I love the shopping list. I love how you can share the recipes easily with someone else. I love how the screen stays on when you‚Äôre cooking and you don‚Äôt always have to turn the phone back on to see the recipe. I love the way you can like and categorize the recipes. This is my favorite recipe app!!!
544,544,5,2020-02-11T23:53:15.000Z,KelliAnn_01,The best recipe app.,"I love this app! Simple easy and delicious recipes. Took me a few minutes to figure out how to find the button to show directions.. i just clicked around until i stumbled upon it! Btw, tap the bottom right numbers that show how long it takes to complete the recipe and it takes you to the directions."
545,545,4,2020-03-24T19:22:14.000Z,Location setting problems,Excellent App,This is an excellent app for when you need a recipe for something.  You can list your available ingredients and then it will list many recipes.  You can also exclude things you do not like or are allergic to.  The only downside is that it is an aggregator of other recipe sites and can be difficult to print or download recipes without signing up for the other sites.
546,546,5,2019-12-21T21:01:03.000Z,Sam's playtime,My go to app,"I‚Äôve other resources for recipes, but this is by far the easiest to use. One of my favorite things about it is when I have some ingredient in my kitchen that I want to use, it has a great search function to help you find a recipe to use it in. I‚Äôve had much less waste and found fabulous recipes because of it."
547,547,4,2020-02-02T05:24:39.000Z,dr. delish,Yes I like Yummly!,"It‚Äôs so convenient and inspiring to go to this app when contemplating cooking with specific ingredients...both for every day meals and for special occasions!  We have recently moved and I had to discard tons of cookbooks...keeping only a chosen few ; more for nostalgia than utility..Yummly takes care of the latter wonderfully! Thank you, thank you thank you!"
548,548,3,2020-01-01T13:25:08.000Z,louismarineau,"Nice App, but not perfect","Well done and pretty app. If you are looking for an app to find you recipes and plan your meals for the first time. This is the app for you, but if you are coming from another program and have recipes you like you will have to leave them behind or find them again. There is no import (Yes I checked online and in the app. If there‚Äôs an import it‚Äôs well hidden). At 4.99/month it‚Äôs the most expensive and I would expect an import."
549,549,5,2019-11-10T17:24:19.000Z,tina bhakta,Amazing app for all your cooking needs!!,"I absolutely love this app because it has everything I‚Äôm looking for. I love being able to look up recipes and add items to my grocery list so easily. I also enjoy the ability to filter certain recipes based on my ingredients, time span, and cuisine preference. I use this app virtually every day now!"
550,550,5,2018-04-28T17:44:05.000Z,ilenewkam,I use this app all the time!,I love that this app searches for recipes all over the internet and also allows you to save recipes that you find on your own in the app. This has become my go to ‚Äúcookbook‚Äù. I don‚Äôt like that some of the blogs it links to have so many pop up ads but that has more to do with the blogs than with Yummly
551,551,4,2018-08-27T20:00:50.000Z,Old n chubby,So far so good,"Just started using it but so far so good, it's annoying to have to go to webpage is outside of the app to get the actual recipes, but that is made up for with the ability to build a shopping list. The shopping list alone has been key and I'm a big fan. Only doing four stars because I haven't made enough for the recipes, just reading the functionality right now."
552,552,5,2018-12-29T18:21:55.000Z,Lvillarreal75,Love the convenience,This app has all the best recipes.  You can add the recipes to your calendar.  There is a shopping list feature that is awesome since it organizes what you need by category making it easier to shop.
553,553,5,2019-02-07T00:04:10.000Z,sonflower39,Most useful app ever!,"This app makes cooking so much easier!! It keeps all the recipes, cooking tutorials, shopping lists(even allows you to change serving sizes), and your favorites all in one place! There are also reviews that let you know how it turns out. It allows you to filter your search in case of allergies! Totally recommend. üòäüëç"
554,554,5,2019-03-12T13:00:57.000Z,cookdinnerathome,Great recipe app!!!!,Love Yummly!!!!!! I use recipes from Yummly 2-4 times a week. I love that u can see the ingredients before opening the whole recipe. My favorite part is the ability to review the recipes and add if it was perfect as is or what people added to improve it. I have reviewed many recipes and even taken other people‚Äôs advice on what to add to many of the dishes I‚Äôve made.
555,555,5,2019-04-12T19:11:45.000Z,Dani seven,Best app I‚Äôve ever downloaded,"I love Yummly, it‚Äôs a perfect app for finding recipes. Everything comes out great! I‚Äôve even referred 6 other people to use this app and they all love it!"
556,556,5,2019-08-27T22:18:58.000Z,Karinneg8,Great App!! Love this App!!!!,I love this app. You can search a specific item or look at their list. It puts together a shopping list so you never forget an ingredient. Love it!!
557,557,3,2019-06-28T22:28:39.000Z,Wooooooooooooooooh!,Room for Improvement,"I really do like Yummly, but it could be better."
558,558,5,2021-06-14T00:59:30.000Z,SmartGirl182,YUMMLY IS THE BOMB üí£ ü§Ø,"So at first it thought it would be like a lot like the other cooking apps.... ITS NOT! It‚Äôs way better! I convinced one of my relatives to help me with one of the recipes. So we made Cheesecake Cupcakes ü•Æ! They turned out amazing üòã. Anyway, the recipes are great quality, you can even make your own!!! But only if you log into Facebook. Definitely recommend üëçüèª."
559,559,5,2021-01-03T20:43:45.000Z,Sarai62,Best Recipe App ever!,I absolutely love this app and look to it every time I want to try something new or am looking for a certain dish to try. I love the tutorials and the ‚Äòseconds‚Äô videos that show how easily a main dish can be cooked up in 15 mins or less. I love that I can save and categorize the dishes I want to make and have made. This app makes cooking fun and easy.
560,560,4,2019-03-04T02:01:15.000Z,WildInTheWest,Super useful,"We use Yummly a lot! Great for finding new dishes. I wish they would omit repeat recipes (5 different sites with the exact recipe will show up in the results). Would like to see more fringe sites indexed (I.e. vegan, international, wild game, etc). Would like to see the ability to log in to multiple accounts at the same time to share, view recipes that have been saved by significant other."
561,561,5,2020-11-14T14:07:08.000Z,hmm323,Tasty!,"I love this app. This year I moved home to care for my aging ‚Äúmeat and potatoes‚Äù parents, with health issues. I myself have been plant based for over two years but I also got lazy about trying new recipes. Needless to say it‚Äôs been difficult planning meals we can all agree on. This is now my go-to app for flavorful, healthy alternatives we can all enjoy. Thanks Yummly!"
562,562,5,2020-07-16T15:05:43.000Z,LilaniKitchen,Easy to use and organize recipes,I have made folders for different types of recipes. I even have a folder that says ‚Äúto try‚Äù as sometimes they sound good but do not turn out the way quite as you expected. I also love the search feature and I‚Äôve never been disappointed.
563,563,4,2020-08-24T22:47:27.000Z,TheGirlsCG,Used to be 5 stars,"This is my favorite recipe app, but over the past couple of updates it no longer shows the picture previews, so I have to guess what the dish looks like from whatever the title is. Otherwise it would be 5 stars."
564,564,4,2020-07-29T22:26:53.000Z,FoodFrenchie04,Great for the most part,"I love the selection of recipes and the fact that I can look at them on my iPad without the screen going black after a minute. The not so good is that often I notice recipes that take 6 or 7 hours to cook, but if you add it to your calendar it tells you to start cooking only 30-60 minutes ahead of when you want to eat. Very misleading !"
565,565,5,2019-11-26T20:40:52.000Z,Mixing & creating,So many options to chose from and colorful pictures!,"I love using Yummly ! It has not steered me wrong. I love that I can search just about anything! And then it also sends me ideas to my emails, for example seasonal dishes."
566,566,5,2019-10-20T16:41:23.000Z,Geselle75,Easy navigation,"I love the way this app is set up. Great to look through for the perfect recipe, pictures displayed nicely, able to add to a category for easy look-up when you want to cook it again, and reviews of the recipes are SUPER helpful when wanting exactly what you‚Äôre looking for. So review the item after you cook it ;)"
567,567,5,2019-08-13T11:58:58.000Z,Herefourth88,Great Go-To App!,"Yummly is a great app! Honestly, it has helped me solve the ‚ÄúWhat the heck am I making for dinner (or other occasion with food). Whether you are looking to use up an ingredient in your fridge, find a tried and true recipe, or try something new, you will find it here. App is easy to use! I suggest it for all kinds of cooks! Recipes are down to earth and easily explained."
568,568,5,2019-08-12T14:01:07.000Z,Jeremy from tucson,Best recipe app ever!,This is my go to app for recipes! It lets me choose the types of ingredients that I like and gives recipes accordingly. I have recommended this app to so many of my friends that have food allergies and it has helped them out. I practice a plant based whole food approach to my diet and always having new recipes to keep my taste buds satisfied is so helpful!
569,569,5,2019-07-31T08:00:33.000Z,brbebear,Favorite app in my phone,"This is my most used app on my phone. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for inspiration in the kitchen, someone who wants to try something new, cooks who want to save the creations, people looking to have dietary restrictions in their meals. It‚Äôs is my favorite tool to clear out my fridge and make the most yummy food possible. Bon appetit!"
570,570,3,2017-11-03T18:58:15.000Z,Triviawiz3000,Better navigation,"I love the recipes that I find on this app. This would be a 5 star review except that they make it such a chore to get to the recipe. Ingredients are on one page, you have to click to get to the directions which sends you to pages that sometimes take forever to load. Advice:direct links to recipe page and an open in safari feature. Bon Appetite. PS anyone else finding it annoyingly difficult to swipe up to ingredients? Still love ya yummly."
571,571,5,2018-10-31T11:24:12.000Z,JPSmall007,I love this app,I use it all of the time for new recipe ideas.  The organizing of recipes and the grocery list function make it really easy.  Only improvement would be to verify that the link to directions actually works.  I have found sporadic recipes that link to a web page that has changed.
572,572,5,2018-12-31T04:15:12.000Z,peggykw,So convenient!,"I‚Äôve used Yummly for over a year and have found it to be the most convenient way to find a great recipe. My only complaint is that my phone locks mid-preparation, so that I continually have to unlock my phone to complete the recipe. That may be a problem I can solve by adjusting my settings, however. Other than that, Yummly is great!"
573,573,5,2021-07-31T20:19:44.000Z,mary jane leonard,YummyPanko crusted tilapia was awesome.,I love this website. Anything that I want to cook I find and the recipes are not just delicious but gourmet.
574,574,5,2020-11-29T14:55:29.000Z,DelightfulDJ,"Great, simple recipes",I have been utilizing Yummly for 2 years now! The app has provided several useful recipes that has been easy to follow and turned out great! My children love the outcome of many of the recipes! I‚Äôm thankful for Yummly! It has broadened my ability to cook and contributed to food ideas/choices I never would have never imagined! ‚ô•Ô∏è
575,575,1,2020-12-22T22:45:10.000Z,dkdiebd s,Issues with Yummly,"Ever since I updated the app, when I receive Recommend for You emails from Yummly & I click on the recipe it no longer takes me to the recipe. Also I sent a link to my daughter & although when she clicks on the link it takes her to the recipe, it doesn‚Äôt take me there. I have reported this to Yummly & I was advised to delete the app. This did not resolve my issue. In fact it deleted ALL the recipes I had saved over the past few years!!!  This is so annoying & I can‚Äôt believe I am the only one experiencing this issue."
576,576,5,2020-11-24T00:19:11.000Z,Semantix,My favorite recipe app,"I wish the full recipes were included in the app instead of through links, but I suppose that‚Äôs more fair for the sources that want full credit, and it‚Äôs done well without any broken links, so it‚Äôs forgivable. Great search features, and great system to save recipes even in several custom lists."
577,577,5,2020-11-22T18:03:05.000Z,todd boshers,Love this App!!!,I am a stay at home husband.  So I do all the kitchen chores including the Cooking for my family of three.  I must tell you after finding and downloading Yummly.  My cooking skills have improved 1000%.  I now enjoy cooking weekday meals have become wonderful meals.  Our Sunday dinners have become gourmet meals!
578,578,5,2020-05-28T22:52:46.000Z,Embuhr,Convenient ! Awesome!,"I‚Äôve used recipes from several sites and usually just end up googling to find a specific recipe, but since getting Yummly I‚Äôve been able to go straight there and find every recipe I need! I‚Äôve even found some from blogs that I‚Äôve used before and love! Easy to use and love the grocery list piece of the app!"
579,579,1,2020-08-19T23:56:57.000Z,fnybny483,App won‚Äôt load!,"Ever since you updated the app to run only on iOS 13 I can‚Äôt even access the app.  I used to use it weekly, it was my go to recipe app, and I had a lot of saved ideas that I can no longer get too.  Poor game guys, some people don‚Äôt have the ability to upgrade their iPad to the new platform and still run iOS 12, so they are unable to use the app. I‚Äôve tried deleting the app and reinstalling multiple times, but it still doesn‚Äôt completely install and therefore no Yummly for me.  I guess I have to go to AllRecipes or something."
580,580,4,2019-03-11T00:28:30.000Z,SultanBruno,My review,"It's a good way to keep track of my favorite recipes, but I wish it didn't reset each time my iPad fell asleep. That makes it difficult to keep track of directions and ingredients when, for example, I am waiting for something to simmer and need to check the next step. Also, it keeps asking me to write reviews even when I've already done so. And again!"
581,581,5,2019-04-28T18:49:13.000Z,Anonapenn,Lifesaver!,Love this app as a busy mom of two under two! I can look up great recipes quickly and see reviews as well. I‚Äôve bought cookbooks in the past and the recipes weren‚Äôt great...which equals wasted time and money. This app allows me to cook recipes more on budget and know my family will actually love eating them! Excellent all around.
582,582,5,2020-04-24T00:04:30.000Z,AllNatural2010,Love,I enjoy being able to search for recipes based on different diets along with appetizer and desserts. I‚Äôm recently transitioning to a vegan lifestyle and being able to have savory tasty recipes available is awesome and Yummly provides just that! I have tried several recipes and they all have been amazing and kid approved. Thank you for this wonderful app!
583,583,2,2020-05-03T18:48:13.000Z,Sirens10,OK most of the time,"Recipes are nice but the emails send the same recipes again and again. If I did t want it earlier, I won‚Äôt want it the next 10 times either. Also, when tapping on a recipe from an email takes me directly to the app and the recipe I tapped on, then all is well. Unfortunately, too many times it takes me to the website and requires me to log in. When that happens, I just close the page and delete the email. Yummly needs to figure out their technology."
584,584,5,2020-04-19T14:56:48.000Z,franern,My best cook book,"I love Yummly , every recipe that I‚Äôve made has been delicious. Like I said I don‚Äôt need cook books anymore, I simply look in my refrigerator and if I have chicken, shrimp or pork , whatever and I just can‚Äôt think what to do with it I go to Yummly and voila there I can find anything and everything needed for my new dish . It‚Äôs easy to use , I just love ‚ù§Ô∏èit ."
585,585,3,2020-04-21T01:59:41.000Z,Culinary jetset,Great Resource!,I really like the app because I am able to review several different recipes to get a good idea of what are the main ingredient the type of cuisine dish may call for.  The only draw back I find is many of the recipes the directions are on another website i.e. blog which then you need to open before you can get to directions and normally means reading through along article before even getting to how to cook the dish.
586,586,5,2020-03-25T17:57:32.000Z,cmarrs505,the delicious recipe you‚Äôre looking for,"I love Yummly and use it several times per week. I have expanded my repertoire of nutritious, tasty meals and have learned new techniques I thought were beyond my ability. It‚Äôs handy to search for recipes using ingredients I already have on hand. I used to cook the same five meals on rotation. Not anymore! Try it - you‚Äôll like it!"
587,587,5,2020-02-08T15:00:15.000Z,TizB.,Food-making made easy,"I have used many Yummly recipes lately, all with great success. The site and options are so well-organized. I am a professional baker so I can especially appreciate the menu planning and ingredient lists. I can hear my teaching chef saying ‚Äúmise en place!‚Äù  Get everything ready BEFORE you start. Yummly helps you do that."
588,588,5,2019-11-16T12:54:19.000Z,LeslieJanelle,Easy meal planning and grocery shopping,"You can filter by any dietary restrictions, save recipes to your profile, create grocery lists directly from the recipe and schedule dinners - saving and scheduling so when it‚Äôs time to cook you don‚Äôt have to go searching for it.  I use this every week for meal planning and grocery shopping and cooking."
589,589,5,2019-11-12T00:37:07.000Z,MrsEmmaP,Sincerely brilliant!,"This is the only recipe app that I need. It‚Äôs flexible, easy to use, and convenient. I love being able to put in my dietary needs and look solely at those recipes. It‚Äôs like a search engine for recipes. It also gives me a grocery list for those meals which makes it to see what I need and what I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a very clever little app."
590,590,3,2018-05-21T00:05:18.000Z,Jdub7715,Mixed review,First off on the service the ap is amazing. Higher than five stars really. Love to customize ingredients for my wife‚Äôs allergies as well as take out the dislikes of the family. That‚Äôs awesome. The con is all the recipes(directions and recipes that is) are hosted on other sites. Not too bad except some of them have friggin novels to read through to find the ‚Äúhow to make‚Äù portion. If it could link directly to the exact spot that would be awesome. Otherwise it gets 3 Stars.
591,591,5,2018-07-15T14:06:14.000Z,aHart4Him,My go-to,"Better than Allrecipes.  From the look, ease of app use to pulling in recipes from anywhere and everywhere."
592,592,5,2018-11-29T16:57:21.000Z,MaggieDogDeal,My Go-To App,I absolutely love this app! I have been using this app for several years now and have found that I rely on it more and more. I tend to be a very good cook but occasionally want to try something new. Yummly has every recipe I have ever look for and even more sometimes. The recipes are clearly written and easy to follow and the layout is great! Thanks Yummly!
593,593,5,2019-02-21T13:09:23.000Z,KayLu75,My Favorite App,"This app has made meal planning soooo much easier-it‚Äôs a recipe box and shopping list all at once and customizable to what types of food or meals you want to focus on...have made so many meals from this app that my husband asks whenever I make something new, ‚ÄúIs this a Yumly recipe?‚Äù He knows it‚Äôs where most of my ‚Äúnew‚Äù stuff comes from."
594,594,5,2021-05-27T03:44:35.000Z,Cariglo,Thanks for Excellent Food Choices,"So, Yummy and their Wonderful Chiefs have provided many good recipes for all of us to enjoy and I‚Äôd like to thank them one and all for the great meals they‚Äôve allowed so many of us to learn, prepare, cook, display, and eat ... Again, thanks and we hope you continue to allow us to view and use your recipes for free ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
595,595,1,2021-06-29T11:29:42.000Z,minneapplegal,App crashing constantly with latest update,I have been a Yummly user for years and love the convenience of this app for turning recipes easily into my shopping list. With the most recent update the app is slow to load my shopping list and I‚Äôm lucky if I can get it to work without crashing while trying to see what produce I needed to buy. I can no longer get the app to clear my shopping list either so it‚Äôs about a mile long at this point. It was so troublesome on my most recent grocery run that I‚Äôm now searching for another app.

597,597,3,2020-06-15T20:33:41.000Z,Jennifer in IL,Love the recipes-hate all the ads,I have been using Yummly for awhile and love the diversity of the recipes. Our family enjoys something new each week. I tried buying the premium package just to get away from all the pop-ups and annoying advertisements just to find they were as bad with premium. I have since cancelled the premium package and just use the free app. But lately I have been so frustrated I‚Äôm ready to find a new app.
598,598,5,2020-02-04T18:56:18.000Z,lolli to the pop,My go to....,"I love this app!  I‚Äôve been using it for years after it was recommended on a morning show. I was soon hooked.  I love to cook and the fact that I can key in what I have on hand and tons of recipes pop up with ideas for dinner.  It truly is my go to, pretty much on a daily basis.  Thanks Yummly for making my life much easier!"
599,599,4,2019-12-28T14:46:53.000Z,kryien,Good recipe collection app.,"I like how I can look online, click a recipe, and the app will open it up for me. That part is true. I also enjoy the save and categorize feature. I find the filters are a bit much and don‚Äôt pinpoint as much as I would like, but that‚Äôs probably because they have soooo many recipes to sort. The app is easy to use, and works really well as a recipe box app."
600,600,4,2018-03-11T22:16:08.000Z,Ilovemymonkeyz,"Like it, but not love it","I would give it 5 stars if it had an option for ingredient substitution, visually need to see the days of the week for each meal that is scheduled so that I can see what I plan to make for the upcoming week, and would love a cooking mode or a way to see the cooking directions without having to scroll all the way to the bottom of the article. Thanks for your time!"
601,601,5,2018-05-08T15:50:38.000Z,Bejwnayikeq,Awesome!,Ability to deselect specific ingredients has made my life 1000x easier as I have multiple food allergies and intolerances recently diagnosed and have had to change how I cook/eat/prepare. Takes a TON of time out of manually scouring sites and I‚Äôve found all sorts of creative and yummy options I never would have done on my own.
602,602,5,2018-07-08T22:44:04.000Z,Purrple11,Such a useful app!,"If you love cooking and want to find new recipes easily, I can't recommend Yummly more highly! It's especially great for finding more unusual recipes, for dietary restrictions for example, and the filtering options are excellent. I've also been impressed with the developer's response to suggested changes. This a really solid, easy to use app. LOVE"
603,603,5,2019-02-03T21:56:14.000Z,Snow43310,Best Recipe App Ever!,"I LOVE Yummly! They have amazing recipes, a grocery list feature, as well as a ‚Äúschedule it later‚Äù option, which is my favorite tool!! I can search for recipes, create grocery lists from my chosen recipe(s), and then have my phone prompt me when to start prepping to have a completed meal at my allotted time!! It has made meal planning so much fun! Thanks, Yummly!!"
604,604,5,2019-03-21T16:10:12.000Z,Jcfcva,A good resource,My perception is that Yummly searches the web for recipes.  There are thousands of them.  In general I have found it useful.  It can be a little frustrating when moving from ingredients to directions as you get sent to the website of the recipe.  Make sure you save the recipes that you like.
605,605,5,2019-04-16T00:53:40.000Z,Wanda_schroeder,My favorite app!!!,"My family and friends will tell you I am a recipe freak! I am always searching the web.. magazines.. newspaper you name it and I was looking for recipes..their app saves me from all that! I found recipes that my granny used to make!! This thing was made for me, I just know it.. lol Thank you a bunch for such a wonderful app!! I love it dearly and use it a LOT!!"
606,606,1,2019-10-10T13:39:24.000Z,girl with backpack,So many issues!,Most of these reviews have got to be paid for because this app is bunk! I‚Äôve just started trying to use my Yummly app and most of the recipes I try to use are either saying ‚Äúthis page no loger exists‚Äù or the webpage is blank and just won‚Äôt load!
607,607,5,2021-06-19T14:45:13.000Z,oldcastler,Simply the best ever,"I love this app, its interface and the beautiful photos. I have over a thousand recipes stored and organized. I like organization and being able to find recipes quickly."
608,608,4,2020-12-07T03:43:32.000Z,Mceric72,Almost perfect,"Would love to see a better integration with Instacart, more stores available for integration. There are stores that I can order directly through the app but for some reason only half of them integrate with Yummly shopping list. Also, couldn‚Äôt find a way to simply copy the recipe and food item and paste it into another app like Facebook."
609,609,2,2020-12-31T02:52:55.000Z,b.e suz,Latest updates,"This has been my recipe go to for years now.  Since this last update I am very disappointed.  When I use the search function it yields results that do not even match my ingredients, the top results may not even. And I am talking simple things like broccoli and chicken.  Also  if I get any results matching at all they are very few.  It has made this app about useless. Is this what I get for not upgrading to the pro version?? I hope that this gets fixed."
610,610,5,2020-12-06T00:38:33.000Z,trusting the journey,Amazing,"I have been using this app for years and now is the time to give my honest opinion! I have used several of the recipes and they all turn out rather well and they‚Äôre tasty and you have a plethora of recipes to choose from, which I absolutely love! I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better app than Yummly!"
611,611,5,2020-11-22T17:19:30.000Z,thrasholee,Love this app,"I love being able to track my favorite recipes, store some for later, and I‚Äôve really discovered some great versions of recipes I‚Äôve been wanting to try. I did whole 30 and I could store my meal ideas here. Super easy to use. And their push notifications are pleasant and not annoying."
612,612,5,2020-11-21T16:01:23.000Z,Primadonnalisa,Love Yummly!,"My go-to recipe app. Always something new. I loved Epicurious in the 90s and early 2000s but it just hasn‚Äôt kept up. I like that home cooks post their own recipes and then I can make them my own. One of these days I‚Äôll get around to my own food blog...until then, there‚Äôs Yummly. An endless source of inspiration no matter what I have on hand!"
613,613,5,2020-06-26T14:54:23.000Z,SuneeSequim,Sooo is this bug fixed????,"I like the recipes I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs the app that‚Äôs annoying. My issue is this: I receive an email from Yummly that looks good; it says ‚Äúopen in the app‚Äù, I open the app from the email and can n e v e r find the recipe in the email. Today‚Äôs example is from Alida's Kitchen ‚ÄúTaco Burgers‚Äù."
614,614,5,2020-05-20T19:45:38.000Z,woodtabbie,Great!,"I use this app at least twice a week! The only thing I wish was different, and it has nothing to do with yumly, is the sites with the recipes! Some have so many pop-up ads that I can‚Äôt read the recipe. Luckily, I can just go back and find another recipe through a different website."
615,615,5,2020-04-20T16:59:28.000Z,taunanana,Perfect recipe app for me,"I love to try new recipes and try to use what I already have in the cupboards. There‚Äôs also more than one food allergies in my family. That said, this app takes all that i to consideration and makes it so easy to find great, high rated, recipes. I use this app at least 3 times a week to cook and save recipes."
616,616,5,2020-03-22T01:31:48.000Z,N*11,I cannot open the app since I updated,"I love this app and use it a lot, but since the last update I can‚Äôt open it. It stays loading for a long time and nothing I have tried has worked. If not for this issue, I would have given 5 stars."
617,617,5,2020-01-16T18:48:10.000Z,Shayyana,One stop shop for recipes,I love this app!  A friend of mine told me about the app and now I am constantly on it looking for new recto try out. Having the filter for specific items works great to when I have to cook for my niece who is gluten free. Or drinks that don‚Äôt require a lot of ingredients. Thank you for this app it‚Äôs been a an amazing piece of information.
618,618,5,2019-12-30T15:55:40.000Z,Traci T,Great App,This app does just what I need which is the capability to search for recipes.  There is always a large number of results for searches.  The recipes can be saved and organized.  I find I often use the List option to create a grocery list. I have not any issues to date with this app.
619,619,5,2019-11-07T19:58:24.000Z,LindaLeah,Recipes,I have in the past few weeks tried 3 different recipes and they have all been outstanding. My husband who is picky has loved them and told me not to alter any of them because he loved them. So impressed by how easy and delicious they are. Thank you will continue to fix more and repeat these that we love.
620,620,4,2018-05-30T18:47:16.000Z,JJn2443,Wish I could search my Yums,"I have more than 500 Yums saved. Wish I could search through them to get to the recipe I need. Would make things easier especially when you know the name of the recipe but don‚Äôt want to have to scroll through hundreds to get to it. Also would like to Yum to personal folders on mobile, which I can do on Desktop"
621,621,5,2018-06-03T19:11:21.000Z,huckleberry5280,Always helpful..,"I literally use the app for almost all my cooking needs at this point. Basically I find recipes on here, use them as a guide, adjust to my palate if need be and then save (yum) it so I can have it whenever I need it. This app has been a life saver when I have very limited time to make food and/or I‚Äôm undecided on what I want to eat."
622,622,5,2018-09-06T17:52:39.000Z,CourtneyRodriguez,"I never write reviews, but!!!","I love this app. I really do. I‚Äôm not paid to write this lol. But this really is a great app. From its awesome suggestions to its easy navigatablilty. Super user friendly. I have yet to run into a link that doesn‚Äôt work, and to go back to what you were looking at previously it‚Äôs all a breeze and scrolling through recommendations is fun."
623,623,5,2018-12-09T18:11:48.000Z,newski,Great planning tool,"The more I use the app, the more I‚Äôm able to plan ahead and creat my shopping lists. The only frustration I find at times are poorly written recipes. Not everyone with a recipe blog has a good eye for detail, so on some (rare?) occasions the shopping list doesn‚Äôt quite match the instructions. Overall, though, it‚Äôs a good app."
624,624,5,2018-12-28T13:30:44.000Z,fjufcbirsbo,Love the shopping list,So convenient to be able to select how many you need add it to the shopping list and delete it when you got it. It helps when you have a huge list and need to go to multiple stores. Also being able to add to the list right from the recipe is great!
625,625,5,2019-01-22T04:05:38.000Z,ppull,THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO GROCERY SHOPPING,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever written a review for an app before, but I couldn‚Äôt NOT rave about this one. It‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve been searching for in a meal planning app, and I have tried EVERYTHING‚ÄîMyPlate, eMeals, Mealime, AllRecipes, literally everything, and this app takes the best of all of them and makes it easily accessible."
626,626,2,2019-11-05T19:36:50.000Z,jesseydjdkf,Can you fix the recipe loading time?,I love the idea of Yummly and use it daily!
627,627,5,2021-01-09T18:33:50.000Z,TheFlabMan,Personalized recipes,It figures out what kinds of recipes you enjoy so they will give you the right kind of recipes. You can also change your preferences in the settings.  They also allow you to look at the recipes before going to the website they are on.
628,628,5,2020-07-13T23:27:13.000Z,Mangia Mr,Turn me into a cook,"Love this site!  Broad array of recipes, easy to access, easy to follow, yet just  challenging enough to lead me into new learning (about foods, kitchen tools, cutting techniques and much more)!  I am a single aging male with essentially zero prior cooking experience.  Now, I‚Äôm a YummlyGuy preparing a variety of delicious dishes and enjoying myself as both chef and dining enthusiast.  Many thanks."
629,629,4,2020-08-31T00:45:23.000Z,54321dar,Great place for great recipes,I like that this app pulls recipes from so many different places. It has gotten a bit more difficult to navigate. Some of the recipes take you to the sight and not the recipe. Then I have to go out of Yummly for the recipe. Some of recipes can have long blogs where they give directions but it‚Äôs difficult to find ingredients. Can be very frustrating.
630,630,5,2018-11-06T09:40:30.000Z,Dreamerlizz1,Best Recipe App!,"I searched and searched for recipes that fit my criteria for family food night, and I must have installed 10 apps and bought 3 cookbooks. The recipes on this app are amazing and I love that they detail it to what you like so you don‚Äôt get recipes that have certain flavors you don‚Äôt like. My favorite app to look at to see what‚Äôs for dinner üíïüôåüèº"
631,631,4,2018-11-19T20:18:01.000Z,Mrs Piombo6,Love,"I love Yummly. It‚Äôs so user friendly and has any recipe you could want. The only thing I‚Äôd change is having to go to a different page for the directions on how to cook it. While on the directions page, there‚Äôs too much stuff going on. I don‚Äôt want the author‚Äôs biography and opinions no just want to make the meal instead of having to scroll through a ton of personal input"

Plus I love that you can adjust the quantity and create a shopping list, this feature makes me turn to it more often than Pinterest which is my other go to"
633,633,3,2019-01-06T13:20:18.000Z,J10220,"Good, but Could be better","The types of recipes are great and some you probably wouldn‚Äôt find on other apps. I love the ability to quickly add to categories and the ingredients to grocery list. However, the add to calendar doesn‚Äôt work and I sometimes don‚Äôt get results for a search one time but then get a few hundred the next time I search the same thing. Not sure if it‚Äôs slow searching it‚Äôs database or what."

Great recipes!,"Have tried many recipes from this app, mainly the easier ones and I have to say all have turned out great and were very tasty. This is my go to app when meal planning if I‚Äôm expecting guests, has great ideas and you can go from an easy recipe to more difficult recipes depending on your cooking skills."

Key in the items and you will have a 100 recipes to choose from. Even if you don‚Äôt know what you want to cook, you‚Äôll find something. I haven‚Äôt found a bad recipe yet. I could spend hours thumbing through recipes. Great app!"

The common family question: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs for dinner?‚Äù can now confidently be answered without no need to dial the nearest pizzaria.  The apron is on thanks to Yummly! Did I mention it makes grocery lists and shopping ten times easier to do!"
638,638,5,2019-12-02T00:07:28.000Z,Sound DAWG,Awesome,"I love the layout of the app.  I am intrigued by the ingredients option.  I haven‚Äôt used it yet.  But, I plan on trying it out.  I‚Äôll update this review once that‚Äôs been done a couple times.  I also really like the ‚ÄúYummed‚Äù lists.  It‚Äôs good for staying organized and makes life easy when you want to go back and find saves dishes."

It has amazing recipes and wonderful instructions, with dieting options. But the choices are vary limited when searching for something sweet that is low-sugar. I wish there where more alternatives for this. That is the only reason I gave it four stars. This app is awesome otherwise, and everyone should download it!"
640,640,5,2017-12-04T21:16:50.000Z,Rebekah29,The best!,"Best food app I have come across. It has so many recipes and so many look so so good! It‚Äôs also nice to be able to type what ingredients I have to find a recipe to fit that one, two, or three items. Anyone I know that likes to cook I tell them about this app , you can be a novice in the kitchen or a pro and still find recipes."

642,642,5,2021-07-11T14:34:44.000Z,Rivera Family Cook,Use this service year round,For regular meals as well as Holiday meal ideas and side dishes. It‚Äôs a wonderful resource for recipes and twists on old recipes and reminders about forgotten details. If you don‚Äôt have all the ingredients for 1 recipe on a dish many times you can find other recipes that require ingredients you do have on hand.
643,643,5,2020-12-24T20:03:43.000Z,Iveylakes,Delicious recipes,I love having recipes at the tip of my fingers. It's great to be able to try so many new recipes & save them for later. I've recommended this app to several people because I thinks it's wonderful. Only thing I don't like was the last update because I can't find the recipes I had saved.

645,645,5,2020-08-14T22:13:44.000Z,Amy95991,A+ from me,I‚Äôve been using the app for almost 3 years.  My family and I have loved every recipe that I have made.  I like the shopping list and use it weekly.
646,646,4,2020-10-26T20:43:52.000Z,JsnBlocks,A huge help,"I worked 7-7 every day and traveled weekly when I was at my job in retail.  Fast food, take out, and delivery was how we ate in our house.  When I retired, I needed to learn how and what to cook.  YUM was the answer.  Actually, it saved my marriage ü§£.  only recommendation is to add a view of all meals scheduled.  I work ahead and sometimes accidently schedule more than one meal.  Am I missing something?"
647,647,5,2020-05-15T02:43:04.000Z,beetlebugg18,Best. App. Ever!!!,You have so many recipes to choose from and you can add it to your saved library and you can even add things you don‚Äôt have to a shopping list.  You can also set an alarm clock for when you want to eat and it tells you when to start prep so you‚Äôre eating when you want. So cool!
648,648,4,2020-05-15T16:30:18.000Z,abbeyb44,Past viewing,"I wish that there was a feature so that you can see the past recipes that you viewed. Like I know that we can see our past searches and save recipes, but sometimes when I forget to save them. It would be great if that feature was there. Other than that I love this so much and I have been cooking and baking every day!!"
649,649,5,2020-04-17T14:44:54.000Z,Nick & Megan,Yummly in general,"This is a great app. Not only are there thousands of recipes but multiple variations within most of the basic recipes. I have often surfed a general list of different ingredients and have found some very delicious meals this way. And lastly, the number of recipes seem to continually grow. Thanks for being a great app."
650,650,5,2018-08-25T21:42:20.000Z,Nanny tanner,Best app I have,Let me tell you! I have tried a lot of apps and this is by far one of the best! So helpful and easy to use! I LOVE the shopping cart where it adds the ingredients to a list and puts them in categories! Perfection! And all of the recipes I have tried so far have been easy and tasty! Thank you yum for creating this resource!
651,651,5,2019-01-21T23:42:41.000Z,KPricd,So much better than Pinterest!,Great for meal planning!  I love that it lets you schedule meals (evening notifying you when to start cooking).  Also love the shopping list feature!  It lets you select what you need for the recipe instead of adding everything like other apps do.  I love how organized the list is also!
652,652,5,2019-03-16T04:18:34.000Z,burnt,Great app!,"From a technical aspect, the app works amazingly. There is a huge selection of recipes and it‚Äôs been really helpful as a guide. I wish there were more authentic ethic recipes but maybe that‚Äôll come with time. Either way this has become a go to stop for everything if I have questions about how to approach a dish."
653,653,5,2019-04-27T00:35:11.000Z,Leah Rachael,So far so good!,This app is super easy and user friendly. We just transitioned into vegetarianism and the app takes the stress out of figuring out what to make. I used to look up items on Pinterest but got frustrated when all of the same recipes kept popping up. Very pleased with this app and love that I can categorize recipes too!
654,654,5,2020-02-23T18:36:58.000Z,hare61,Most helpful Application I use daily,"I use Yummly all the time! If I need to find a specific recipe  know I a find it here. And with my spouse going Vegan recently, it has been a godsend, since I am inexperienced in the Vegan world. I tell people all the time, especially the less experienced cook, who can now get a guided tutorial. Keep up the good work!!"
655,655,5,2020-01-15T13:26:40.000Z,Britt9165,Amazing app!,I‚Äôm new to cooking & just bought an air fryer. I looked up cooking apps and this is the first one to pop up. I found so many amazing recipes on here that I started saving to my profile and have actually tried a couple üòã so glad I came a crossed this app. I can‚Äôt wait to start cooking more for my growing family.

657,657,4,2020-01-11T19:14:52.000Z,Mm Wold,Great recipes app,I love Yummly and use it all the time.  I do have a suggestion for recipes that are saved and that is to be able to add notes to saved recipes so if it is a favorite and you want to back it again you may want to add notes about tweaking or adding ingredients to your family‚Äôs liking so that you remember it the next time you go to make it
658,658,5,2019-08-26T08:10:49.000Z,JanieKonyek,Love the variety,"I love being able to just search a food for recipes or finding a specific recipe. It helps when you can see how many times the recipe has been ‚Äòyummed‚Äô, so you can know if the recipe is on point, needs some changes, or if it‚Äôs not really that good. Will be using this app forever!"
659,659,4,2019-08-19T00:14:28.000Z,Cnkvogel,It‚Äôs great but is room for little improvements,I really like the app now that some kinks have been worked out. I kind of would like to be able to see directions on the initial page you bring up rather than having to click to another page. Sometimes I won‚Äôt want to choose that recipe because of the time and complexity.
660,660,5,2019-06-07T16:22:34.000Z,JohannaJean,Best dinner app ever!!!,I always wanted an app that i could enter ingredients and it would show me meals with those ingredients included!!! This does that and you can also take a pic and it will recognize the food!! Unreal!no more wondering what ill make! It can add meals to your calendar and even tell you when you should start prepping for a scheduled dinner!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
661,661,5,2019-06-08T23:11:28.000Z,Granny Blizzard,Recipes at my fingertips,The only recipe book I can take to the store and get what‚Äôs on the list at my fingertips.
662,662,5,2020-10-04T13:49:14.000Z,DaleC73,Long time user,I started using Yummly about two years ago and this app is an absolute life saver! The shopping list helps me save money and keeps me on trac a the grocery store. The recipes also make my life in the kitchen so much easier considering that I cook everyday. Thanks so much to the developers of this wonderful app!
663,663,5,2020-05-08T18:41:23.000Z,Edzinn,Yummly is yummy!!,"I love this app and service it is a great place to be inspired about what to cook when you are short on ideas. They have many customizable features that allow you to even put you grocery list together and shop at your favorite stores, base on the choices you have made."
664,664,5,2020-04-23T14:19:36.000Z,love to cook&bake,I use this site for most recipes,I can always find a recipe when I need it. I bake a lot and almost all of the recipes I‚Äôve found on here. And they are delicious. It‚Äôs easy to use and you can even filter out the ingredients you want or don‚Äôt want to use which is really helpful to me. I strongly recommend!
665,665,5,2020-01-27T03:23:55.000Z,kathryn wakefield,"Amazing, my constant go-to",Love Yummly.   Have cooked for my family of one and many gatherings using this app.   Always a crowd-pleaser.  Also a cooking education!   I‚Äôm pretty instinctive when it comes to throwing together an impromptu unprompted by recipe meal when the spirit moves me and I must say it‚Äôs educated guess work these days due to my following of this app for years.   Cheers!
666,666,5,2019-12-25T14:06:44.000Z,"it got bacon, right?",Top 10 of all Apps,"I love this app, when ever I have a gathering or go to one I always bring a dish. This app is my go to place for appetizers or other dishes. Nearly every recipe is straight forward and complete. The photos are great, that‚Äôs what always makes me stop and look at the recipe."
667,667,5,2019-08-18T22:59:39.000Z,Tag 1001,Great app but,This is a great app but I am having trouble with it allowing me to sign up thru the app on my iPhone!! It will send me the confirmation but when I click on the iPhone link I get nothing!! Please fix and I will make this five stars!!
668,668,5,2019-08-16T14:07:26.000Z,tiller 5000,Get this,I have been using Yummly since 2015 and it‚Äôs only getting better
669,669,5,2019-06-29T15:58:13.000Z,Lori'lei,Love Yummly!!!,Hate talkie video instructions. Just want basic instructions not lifestyle Babble children babble- love the video instructions that show ingredients being poured into a bowl with measuring specifics and directions on preparation - The rest is torture and if it looks like one of those videos I won‚Äôt even click on the recipe no matter how delicious it looks.
670,670,5,2018-05-16T18:57:38.000Z,Madizmm2,Easy and Serving Control,Love the app as it‚Äôs easy to search for what you want. Also like the ingredients being linked to other apps. But the ability to adjust the servings is really the best function. That way I know how much to make for my family or for a larger gathering. Definitely recommend this app.
671,671,4,2018-10-16T00:55:51.000Z,Tita's Lover,Helpful,This app offers a wide range of recipes for all skill levels. I‚Äôve found a variety of recipes for a dish i was specifically looking for which had inspired some improvements in my technique and the dish. Good place to find a dish to make with the ingredients i have but not sure what to make. I haven‚Äôt found everything I‚Äôve wanted to make here but this is still my go to.
672,672,3,2018-11-07T15:37:30.000Z,paco meh,Turn my frown upside down!,I feel terrible giving yum only 3 stars. My reasoning is because of the extra added step to sign in. Before I was able to sign in easily. Now I have to sign in through my email account which makes the process longer. I still love the app and enjoy finding recipes so I can cook for my family. I would definitely give yum yum a higher rating if it was easier to access.
673,673,5,2019-01-06T19:56:35.000Z,Ah$@,AH@&@,"This is a unique app for recipes. I can‚Äôt say enough about it. It has all the types of diets , vegan, Mediterranean, Asian,French , etc. can be customized according to your diet. I really love it. Works really smooth, no disconnects issues. Any time I need recipe, I just open it and find smoothie, side dishes, or a dinner. Variety of millions recipes . I never regret it and glad I found it."
674,674,5,2019-03-14T17:39:18.000Z,Nan Cee Na,Love it,"Love it!  So helpful in figuring out what to eat.  I‚Äôm a five ingredient type chef!  Makes me looney when there are 20 things and might have to go shop.  A girl just does not have time or money for that.  Makes cooking for the single girl easy, healthy !  Then it is easy when you‚Äôre cooking for that ‚Äúhe might just be the one‚Äù date!"
675,675,5,2021-06-08T22:58:23.000Z,anmkum,Love the features but app is buggy,"I love the features, especially when I can take any recipe from the web and store it in my app. But the app is buggy because when I go to check the recipes they disappear when I'm scrolling through the list. Super annoying."
676,676,5,2021-04-04T18:17:10.000Z,Bummed out Chef,If you have problems support is great!  Love this app!,give this a 5 star rating because I LOVE Yummly but when I did the latest update it erased all of my saved recipes!  Thank g I still have old version on my iPad so I don‚Äôt lose everything!  I hope this bug gets fixed and I get my saved recipes back.
677,677,5,2020-05-11T00:34:38.000Z,Kelly C.L.,No problems,Came to Yummly with no expectations but so was blown away! It has or has a link to anything and everything I‚Äôve typed in‚Äîand I‚Äôve typed in some very spontaneous things (silkie chicken comes to mind). Might try the upgrade eventually; but the basic app finds seems to fit my needs for now.
678,678,3,2021-03-06T02:04:04.000Z,hanjjsj777899,Too focused on pro,"This was one of my favorite apps and it‚Äôs still great for finding recipes and making shopping lists, but lately it‚Äôs too focused on making all its users sign up for the paid version and it‚Äôs logging me out every time I close the app which makes it super tedious and annoying and tedious to use. Hopefully these bugs get fixed soon because it used to be a great and easy to use app."
679,679,4,2020-03-16T14:08:24.000Z,grannysim,Great but....,"Yummly is a great app. I have been using it for years. I plan my weekly dinners and make my shopping list only on this app. I have become completely dependent on Yummly and it always makes my life easier. My big problem is that I recently downloaded an update and now I can‚Äôt open the app. Therefore, I feel lost and sad about it. Any ideas as to what can I do?"
680,680,5,2019-03-11T16:53:21.000Z,Plexusgal,My most used app!!,"Yummly has been a total game changer for me and my family!  I love how easy it is to use, so many wonderful recipe ideas for the same dish~ pick which one you like best! My kids have learned to be more active participants in the choosing/prepping/cooking arena thanks to this app.  I recommend it all the time to friends!!"
681,681,4,2019-05-30T00:48:56.000Z,MommaTama,Liking it so far,"While I wasn‚Äôt able to put in diabetic for menu planning, there were enough other options to let me work around that. I like that it gives dietary info, the dump to a shopping list is very helpful, and I‚Äôm looking forward to being able to scale recipes up and down based on how many people are eating that meal."
682,682,5,2019-12-28T14:07:21.000Z,usmc2092,Love It!,"Enjoy the helpful ideas that make choosing tonight's meal and easy one plus the reviews. People who have prepared the dish often give you insight of how they did or didn't like the dish, plus ideas on how they improved it as well. My wife and I keep the app on both of our cells yummy easy to use and navigate. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
683,683,4,2020-01-25T22:14:33.000Z,Cathunsin,"Cool app, but..","The app works great... However when I modify the number of servings for meal prep purposes it does not reflect in the grocery list. Say the original servings were 2 servings and I want to increase it to 6 servings . I increase it to 6  and add it to the shopping list. The shopping list quantitites still reflect 2 servings. I didn't mind doing the math at first but it got slightly annoying , nonetheless great app great meals"
684,684,5,2019-12-11T19:19:16.000Z,Kinky Chinky,What everyone is looking for!,I have been extremely satisfied with this app from day 1! Such a wide variety of recipes. Best part to me - the customization options. Ideal for anyone with food allergies or restricted diets. I have not used the grocery list option much but a very helpful feature. Recommend to EVERYONE!
685,685,4,2019-12-25T17:30:23.000Z,NAD-X,Almost Perfect,"This app is great! Only issue I had is the fact that it doesn‚Äôt always work well on my iPad. Meaning, sometimes I have problems loading directions, and issues with making recipes based on ingredients."
686,686,5,2019-12-09T18:55:45.000Z,Oyakemi,Wonderful resource,Menus are easy to follow. Love the variety and personalization abilities. Pictures are clear and everything I‚Äôve made comes out looking like their pictures. The app is also very user friendly. I‚Äôve been using this resource for several years and will continue to use it.
687,687,5,2019-08-28T23:13:58.000Z,whst the f*ck,Awesome,I have been using Yummly since 2009. I love this app I‚Äôm on it daily because i love searching for recipes and i recommend to everyone. My cooking skills over there‚Äôs have vastly improved thanks to skills i already had and Yummly!! It‚Äôs the only app that gets used just as much or even more than instagram sometimes lol.
688,688,2,2019-11-11T03:40:00.000Z,MS Testman,Not very intuitive.,I like Yummly but it needs a redesign.  A good program is intuitive.  A first time user should be able to open the program and start using with very little research on how the program works.  I have been using Yummly and it is a little confusing.  Does the orange icon mean you have added the recipe to your list or does the white one Yummly icon mean this.  Make it easier to determine if the recipe has been added or not.  This would be most helpful.
689,689,4,2019-08-28T01:37:41.000Z,Bugsli,Super App,"Nice to have access to many different cooks, blogs, recipes from all over - right in one spot. The only drawback I find for myself is that it seems with each recipe there are a a load of pictures and every writer thinks the have to write a short story about how the recipe was created. I'm not particularly into that but I'm sure others are - so just personal preference."
690,690,5,2018-02-13T21:05:05.000Z,Tia Rogers,Best app for beginners.,"This app is amazing. I can select from ingredients I have on hand. I can set dietary preferences. I can schedule meals and will get alerted when it‚Äôs time to start prepping/cooking. The meals I‚Äôve made (more than 50) are all 5 stars according to my family. This app has made me realize how much I love cooking. Also, the meal inspiration is endless."
691,691,5,2018-05-29T20:27:52.000Z,tjacks59,Love this app!,"I love how you can add your dietary restrictions and it‚Äôll give you that version of a recipe. Much easier than looking all over the internet for different recipes, this app puts them all in one place easy to find! I‚Äôve made so many cool dishes from recipes I‚Äôve found here and tell all my friends about it."
692,692,5,2018-09-17T23:31:27.000Z,Tommy's Aunt Gawk.,Just the inspiration I needed.,LOVE this app.
693,693,5,2018-09-27T20:29:31.000Z,Ollie&Evvie,Thank you,"This app is amazing. I hate cooking because I have a lot of food restrictions, don‚Äôt know how to cook really and don‚Äôt have a ton of time to plan meals, write lists learn recipes etc. this app makes it sooo much easier by putting the shopping lists together and allowing me to find recipes that meet all my time/dietary requirements."
694,694,3,2018-11-06T23:52:58.000Z,caseyawurst,Awesome app when it works,"I really like it‚Äôs functionalities, from creating a grocery list from ingredients, to being able to sort recipes by dietary choices, to finding meals based on ingredients or avoiding recipes based on ingredients. The only problem I have is when I have connection, it constantly gives me a pop up that there‚Äôs no connection. I also have trouble adding recipes I find online with the app."
695,695,4,2018-11-21T18:10:43.000Z,EriqBay,Almost perfect,"It‚Äôs a great app no doubt about it. Rather than one persons opinion and recipes you get a great collections of recipes from around the world that encourages broad commentary on how to improve, modify or more quickly enjoy the recipes. My one recommendation would be to integrate Siri or Google voice into the app. It can become a challenge to try and follow the directions and prepare the meal simultaneously"
696,696,4,2018-12-30T16:30:29.000Z,wwwonderwomanww,Long time user and devout vegan,I love love love this app. So user friendly and has a ton of vegan recipes to choose from. The absolute only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that I wish I could search the recipes I‚Äôve Yummed. I‚Äôve been using this app for a few years now so my Yum list is deep! Please stop the scrolling!!! Add a search function in the Yummed section please !
697,697,4,2019-01-04T04:12:29.000Z,Barb5555,Ingredients,"I love that you can put in the ingredients you have on hand and find a variety of recipes. The only thing I wish is that I could enter that I want one particular ingredient to be the star. Such as when I type in Pecan, I chose pecan because I was given two gallon bags of pecans and no idea what to do with them haha. It took a while before I found a recipe where pecan was the central ingredient."
698,698,5,2021-01-03T04:46:35.000Z,JKCRAGG,great ideas,when I want to try a new vegetable I can always find not one but several recipes for the vegetable. I use Yummly at least 3 times a week!! I can always find a new variation of a vegetable or meat dish that I usually make but now find a updated version!! Yummly is mt go to app at least 4 times a week!
699,699,2,2021-02-16T15:44:16.000Z,bj1951,Used to love it,"For several years this was my go to cooking app.  I have dozens and dozens of yums. However, each new update has made the app less and less user friendly.  It is a classic case of messing with something that is already great.  Lest you think I am just an old fart who is not tech friendly, quite the opposite is true.  Technology is the first place i go for most things.  Unfortunately, I have begun turning way from Yummly in my search for simpler is better."
700,700,5,2020-12-27T22:14:52.000Z,Lhhnjjbhf,Time Saver,This app has helped me save time when thinking of dishes to prepare for my meal prep. I‚Äôm able to organize my recipes within the app to sort through later. I also like the fact that it gives me the nutritional value for most recipes. It feels like Pinterest with a focus on recipes.
701,701,5,2020-11-12T22:59:48.000Z,Skroman87,Best thing yet!!!!,I love the ability to have such a massive library of recipes at my finger tips for new and existing ideas. The ability to add items from any recipe to a shopping list with one click is amazing. Been using it for a couple of years without any complaints. Well done app!!
702,702,5,2020-11-05T11:57:32.000Z,bacjac.fab5,Great app; Think of an ingredient you want to eat and search!,There‚Äôs not another app out there that gives you so much flexibility and creativity with ingredients.  There have been many times I wanted to cook a with a particular meat or vegetable and searched finding so many options.
703,703,5,2020-08-16T18:36:57.000Z,AllieJDaniels,Helpful In A Pinch,My family has been saved by this app in a pinch or when we have NO IDEA what to do about dinner. We‚Äôve entered items we have in our fridge/pantry and have gotten simple and easy recipes. I love that I can customize the dietary needs so I don‚Äôt have to scroll past recipes that I have no use for.
704,704,5,2020-08-13T06:27:19.000Z,Pleasedperson2,Clear graphics with endless choices.,Easy to navigate and choices are limitless! Coordination with ingredients needed in a recipe and shopping list is also smooth. Best of all is the ability to bookmark a recipe that you know you will retrieve later. It‚Äôs a well conceived app that I return to often.
705,705,5,2020-07-26T21:03:55.000Z,DakotaFoniBaby,There‚Äôs No Other Way That I Could Cook,"As a new vegetarian, this app has relieved so much strain on figuring out what I want to cook & even when I need to start cooking."
706,706,5,2020-06-30T15:41:51.000Z,5-0 good app,I love this app!,This app has been so helpful when meal planning or if I neglected to plan properly and need to figure out something to cook quickly with on hand ingredients.
707,707,5,2020-02-09T19:28:32.000Z,Perpetual commuter,Easy and Convenient!,I always like the results of having cooked something but don‚Äôt enjoy the hassle of hunting down the ingredients then what to do with them.  Yummly on both my Laptop and Phone makes it easy and convenient to shop for the needed ingredients then put them together as directed.  A great app!
708,708,4,2020-06-03T21:17:32.000Z,Britt1908,Perfect for new ideas,This app helps me learn new recipes just by the ingredients I have. I can say what I want to make and it comes up with tons of recipes and you choose which one appeases you the most. I‚Äôve tried so many new things with it. My only recommendation would be if the app included recipes for more cultural foods. I‚Äôd love it if I could find West African dishes on here as well.
709,709,4,2020-03-26T21:54:34.000Z,Thea 55 11,Great Recipe and Excellent Pictures,"It is a good app, however it is a little sporadic in its development.  It tends to wander when applying a search.  Sometimes I have to repeatedly request things in order to receive the proper page. It does provide a tremendous amount of recipes in which I find are delicious!  Most important is the detailed instructions, which allows a novice to perform wonders."
710,710,4,2018-05-29T20:05:58.000Z,ZippyCrego,"So far, I really appreciate this app",Yummly is a genuinely good app. I am not the smartest person to use a smart phone so I wish the icons were a little easier to understand but I am sure if I was just a little more tech savvy like most people I would use this app ALL THE TIME. Right now I use it when I have time.
711,711,5,2018-08-19T13:58:33.000Z,Kristie Kay,Love Yummly!,I use Yummly for all my dinners! There are so many options and you can find 20+ recipes for any given dish. Cocktails too! easy to organize all my saved recipes. Being able to change the serving sizes to adjust the recipe is key! I'm always making random amounts of dinner depending on if I need left overs for lunch or not. Great app!
712,712,5,2018-09-01T21:30:21.000Z,Nippy7,Excellent,"I was using the app on and off for awhile. However, now I use it regularly. Planning and making my meals are easier since I can schedule not only the date I want to eat, but the time. What's even better is that a reminder text is sent to me to begin preparing if I want to eat on time. Absolutely WOW!"
713,713,5,2018-11-29T00:42:56.000Z,Connie in Cleveland,The greatest recipe app ever,I stumbled on Yummly googling a recipe for something and O M G this is so perfect if you want to cook something for dinner with 2 chicken breasts or half a pound of shrimp or an eggplant it is better than ANY cook book EVER because it has everything you can eliminate things like butter ( who would do that though) how many ingredients amount of time. It‚Äôs the best!
714,714,5,2019-01-01T03:41:40.000Z,fhurixbrbfj,Best COOKING APP,Highly recommend! I‚Äôm a Pinterest lover but this app is perfect to dwindle down ideas and put your shopping list in a convenient spot. Makes the process that much more enjoyable and practical. Plus I‚Äôm never overwhelmed by the options and how to organize all the recipes - a dilemma I usually run into using Pinterest.
715,715,5,2019-01-21T20:39:35.000Z,Mamaw Jackie,I can find anything on this site!,"Rather I‚Äôm looking for something sweet or something new or something low-fat, I always find what I‚Äôm looking for!  I‚Äôve told several of my family members and friends all about Yummly and how awesome it is. Would recommend this recipe site to anyone looking for a great source for recipes."
716,716,5,2019-05-01T21:38:08.000Z,Yoda2016@,"Easy to use, nice wide variety",I like using this app to search for recipes. Not having to sift through adds when I‚Äôm trying to find a recipe for dinner is nice. I switched over from Pinterest for that reason. I am a little discouraged that when I search a lot of my already hummed recipes come up.
717,717,5,2020-02-01T01:58:28.000Z,AustinOrthoMom,YUM,I love YUMMLY it has introduced me to a plethora of recipe blogs and never fails to connect me to a recipe to match my mood (or more often the contents of my cupboard and fridge).  The suggestions are not always exactly on target but I love being able to peruse a variety of recipes for any given dish and select elements of each to make it uniquely my own. Thanks Yummly.
718,718,5,2019-11-18T15:23:19.000Z,bob 62,Love this app!,"Over the last few years, I've enjoyed doing more of the cooking for my wife & I as well as family & friends. I found this app a couple of years ago and use it very frequently for new recipes & ideas. In my opinion it is an absolutely great recipe reference that is easy to use."
719,719,5,2019-10-12T02:15:17.000Z,kellz belz,Love This App,I have been using this app over the years. They continue to make it better.  Extremely user friendly.  I can plan my week of meals pretty quickly with my library of recipes.  Can even make my grocery list on it.  Overall I would highly recommend!!
720,720,3,2018-03-31T14:16:04.000Z,etherkehhi,Pretty good,For a novice cooker this app is great!! I cook for 5-7 when I cook so the fact that I can change the servings are perfect!!! Only thing with this app is the recipes repeats itself!! Once you do a handful of main recipes you‚Äôre out of options . More meat recipes would be great. Not the same recipes over and over and over again. And make the app a little more intuitive....you would blow the competition out of the water!!
721,721,5,2020-12-18T23:03:12.000Z,dada7,Great food app,List your ingredients you have and watch the magic! Also I like how it makes you read the peoples articles a little bit because you do learn a lot even though you think you know it all and you just want to get to the directions.
722,722,4,2021-01-25T17:11:37.000Z,Yummy fan,So easy & so Yummy!,"I love being able to quickly save recipes from anywhere, and have them saved in one place, that can be accessed from anywhere. You can pull up a grocery list for any recipe anytime, which is good for me because I don‚Äôt usually think about it till I‚Äôm at the store.  The recipes are delicious, I‚Äôve tried many thanks to Yummly!‚ù§Ô∏è"
723,723,5,2020-11-27T15:46:24.000Z,AThib13,Overall helpful app,"Some recipes cannot be added and some recipes won‚Äôt automatically add stuff to your shopping list, but they can be manually added. Overall a very useful app for meal planning- I love the feature that adds it to my family‚Äôs shared google calendar!"
724,724,5,2020-11-02T19:34:46.000Z,Sweetlips-maraj,I just LOVE IIIITT,"This app is amazing ! Have all sorts of foods (most of them are very easy to make), it specifies the quantity, many have the actual video doing it w/ u step by step so u can pause, go back and mark every single tool or ingredient and the option to avoid it and continue! Whatever is more comfortable! It‚Äôs just awesome !"

Great that I can save and categorize my favorite or those I wish to try later. Wonderful that an ingredient list can be generated from your chosen recipe(s) and have a specific shopping list just for what you need. So helpful and handy."

My fianc√© is the chef of the house but 1-2X a week I like to pull my own weight and give it a go. Thanks to Yummly I‚Äôm able to make something good every time! My favorite feature is that you can add specific items to your grocery list. Thanks Yummly!"
727,727,4,2020-08-16T18:18:55.000Z,Matthew Mason13,Excited to Cook,"Excited to try the recipes in this app! One thing I‚Äôd like for searching through recipes in the Yums section and search results is a more compact view. I‚Äôm on a 12.9 inch iPad and the squares/images are just too big.  On a smaller screen it‚Äôs good, but I‚Äôd like a compact view for the larger screens so I can see more on one page. Other than that, this is great!"
728,728,5,2020-01-12T19:20:24.000Z,mmc_92,A must for those with limited kitchen skills!,Always finding something interesting ... step by step instructions are great for kitchen beginners too! I just wish the ingredients / recipe instructions were on one page instead of having to link through to another site.

As a result, we‚Äôre eating at home 95% of the time and enjoy trying new things. Yummly allows me freedom to explore new things by suggestions OR I can plug in a couple of ingredients on hand, and ‚Äòwah la,‚Äô I have several recipes appear."

I can quickly search for recipes with only a few ingredients.  You can also access recipes that you have save through a desktop computer.  I highly recommend.
731,731,5,2019-02-12T14:04:50.000Z,Mike the mute,The best for ‚Äúchefs‚Äù,"This app is the most important appliance in my kitchen. From those of us who want to discover new recipes to people just trying to make use of what‚Äôs in the fridge, Yummly nails it. Search for recipes by the dish or just typing in a single ingredient. Send ingredients to your shopping list. Set reminders according to prep/eating time. Just awesome."

Also love that I can add all of the ingredients for a recipe to my shopping list, and those ingredients are broken down into categories (produce, meat, spices, etc.). Can also add other items (that are not part of the recipe) to the shopping list. Amazing!!"

They usually have easy to find interesting and inexpensive ingredients.  Please keep sending them.  They are also quick to solve problems when I encounter them while cooking.
737,737,5,2019-10-04T15:57:53.000Z,Tkledpink,Great recipe app!,"My sister suggested this app to me. I was tired of always cooking the same old dishes. Yummly is great! It has so many recipes. If you are on the Keto, Paleo dieta or any other they even give you so many recipes that fit your eating life style. I have already made many meals with this helpful app and so far all have been a hit!"
738,738,3,2019-10-22T18:05:04.000Z,Adulting 102,Good but Glitchy,I love Yummly and all of the different recipes. The only thing that drives me nuts about it is how glitchy the app is. Whenever I‚Äôm scrolling to look through all my Yums and then click on one and then try to back out of it. It automatically scrolls me to the top again and so I lose my place and have to constantly keep scrolling down. It‚Äôs a great app. They just need to find lots of little glitchy details.
739,739,5,2019-09-07T17:47:39.000Z,warrenton313,Use the app almost daily,Found Yummly about two years ago. I love to use the app for finding new recipes.  Also like to compare versions of a recipe for seasoning variations. I also like that nutritional info is available for most recipes. Hope this new version allows landscape viewing on my iPad.

742,742,5,2018-07-12T03:11:30.000Z,Bh balance,Great selection of recipes and tips,My family has enjoyed using this app in creating our meals for the week. It has a huge variety of recipes to search from and like the filter options when thinking about what you have in the fridge in that moment.
743,743,4,2018-07-18T05:50:47.000Z,Healthy Analyst,Why I use and like Yummly,I started using the app to help me Identify healthy meals for Pre diabetics.  I liked the features it has to help identify things you want to eliminate like low sugar and gluten free items.  My only suggestions would be to add more features to help with identifying healthier eating choices.  The recipes are very good and I like being able to share and flag them for future usage.
744,744,5,2018-10-15T21:40:24.000Z,mooneje,Excellent Ap!,"I‚Äôve used Yumly for more than a year now. It makes shopping for and preparing great meals so easy. And I‚Äôve learned so much about cooking. While I don‚Äôt have a lot of time to cook, I find that matching good meals to my time has dramatically increased my quality of life. Is that over the top?  Kinda, but it really has been so good for me."

747,747,4,2018-12-18T18:04:51.000Z,CaraMeaghan,Pretty nice app!,"I haven't used a recipe app before so I dont have much to compare it to, but it has worked pretty well for me and also has the option for grocery lists within the app if you choose to use that option - it allows you to add ingredients to your list directly from a recipe you want to make or add items not linked to a recipe."
748,748,3,2021-08-03T01:50:52.000Z,Mobk12345,The latest version made changes the make the app much less easy to use.,I don‚Äôt know why you would choose to change the method of organizing recipes from being able to see the recipe you‚Äôre updating and categorizing to making it a blind function.

Honestly it‚Äôs really annoying every time I get a recipe that I want to use it‚Äôs on this page and I end up having to go somewhere else because I don‚Äôt like your website or app I only gave it to stars because it has such good recipes butOther than that I don‚Äôt want to use it and I‚Äôm not going to

I don‚Äôt pay for pro so I‚Äôd expect ads but the videos are obnoxious.  This used to be a 5+++ star app that‚Äôd I‚Äôd recommend to everyone but now, not so much."
751,751,4,2021-04-22T13:57:10.000Z,mrehays,Great App,"My girlfriend and I love this app with all the variety out there. We have been passing along recipes that we have made and really liked to our family and friends. We would prefer to be able to adjust the meal quantity as the default is all ways for four. However, we just cut the recipe in half since it‚Äôs just us two."

I don‚Äôt like having to click separately on the directions for each recipe. Just list the ingredients and directions on the same screen. 3. I don‚Äôt want to read what the blogger was thinking or had for lunch on the day she came up with the recipe, just tell me what‚Äôs in it and how to make it."

I like being able to put recipes that I can‚Äôt make now but sound good to try later. If you do make a recipe on here it‚Äôs easy to share your thoughts on it for others. Great app!
754,754,5,2020-09-08T22:32:35.000Z,Addicted to Yum,Totally addictive,I love this app! I am constantly browsing through recipes for my next idea and ‚Äústockpiling recipes‚Äù in my ‚Äúyum‚Äù! I have recommended this app to my children and several friends. This is the best recipe source I have ever used and it is my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù as opposed to the multitudes of ebooks I have purchased over the years.

When I am scrolling through recipes and then click on one to look at it, when I go back it always takes me back to the top of the search page. I am getting so annoyed by this that I may delete it and just use google to find recipes."

I have a lot of recipes but if I want to organize them I have to go into each one separately and add them to the collection I chose. Then when I go back to all Yums it reloads and I‚Äôm back at square one. Why not have a select feature to add to collections. Also the more recipes the more lag I encounter.

795,795,5,2018-07-08T01:40:49.000Z,kuffy mc stuffy,Yummy,I love it I have made three recipes from the book very easy to make for one and they tested very good thumbs for yummy üëåüëç
796,796,5,2018-08-24T17:20:32.000Z,barma24,Perfect for special diets,I‚Äôve had to change my way of thinking since a family member was diagnosed with illness and is also a picky eater. This has helped me find recipes he likes while keeping in line with the diet restrictions. Thank you! I‚Äôve recommended this app to many friends and family.
797,797,4,2018-10-10T17:09:56.000Z,Minicozzi23,Really fun to use,"I think an app like this should have been created years ago, it just makes sense! I love online recipes and this makes it easy to organize and access them."
798,798,5,2018-12-02T04:06:35.000Z,Queen Dalia,Quick fix!,"Wow! I‚Äôm hyper impressed by the tech team‚Äôs quick reply to a report of a video not linking. They not only are taking action to remove the recipe and link, but provided alternative recipes for strawberry chia jam!!!"
799,799,4,2019-01-05T17:00:59.000Z,Carrington26,Nutrition Facts,I love the app and it‚Äôs helping me so much with my Keto style of living but I‚Äôm getting  a little confused on the serving size vs the nutritional facts. If I change the serving size the calories or facts don‚Äôt change. So the calories and facts that are up when you open the page what do they stand for ? Is that always just for one serving? Thank you! Great app cant wait to make more!
800,800,3,2017-11-05T05:17:46.000Z,line riderr,Love this app - recent crashing,I've added so many recipes to my dinner line-up for every week. Everything I could want to make is here and the recipes are top-notch while also being simple enough to throw together in no time.
801,801,5,2021-01-03T21:20:03.000Z,Biggirl4,Loving all the recipes,When cooking is something you do for family and friends. Trying something new is always a hit. On this website I have found some recipes to knock you off your feet and leaving you full as a tack. Thank you all for sharing
802,802,3,2021-08-14T21:20:50.000Z,MissMaeJean,Great but hating the locked guided,"I love the layout of this app and love using ingredients to find recipes. But I swear 9/10 of all the explore recipes are locked guided and I‚Äôd need to pay monthly in order to access the recipes. This isn‚Äôt a thing on my friends app, but it is for mine. It‚Äôs very frustrating, so I just save them to look up the dish name later on Google. It‚Äôs an extra step I wish I didn‚Äôt have to take."
803,803,5,2020-11-12T19:51:56.000Z,Bailey Bean14,Great App to Find New Recipes,"I got tired of eating the same meals over and over, so I went on a search for apps to help me find new recipes. Yummly is the best app I‚Äôve found so far! It‚Äôs like Pinterest for recipes only! I have found about 6 meals that I added into my rotation and have dozens more that I want to try."
804,804,4,2020-12-30T23:51:34.000Z,ticked off annie,"It‚Äôs really great, but....","You took away the portion size measuring tool, for a single person that doesn‚Äôt want a lot of leftovers it‚Äôs kind of mean lol. But it‚Äôs a really great app I have found my most favorite app when it comes to recipes, not only that but I have been recommending this app to a lot of people (being military in the barracks as well) so they can enjoy!"
805,805,1,2020-12-30T05:30:04.000Z,Jmona0352,"Used to be the best app, now not so much","It does not work. It doesn't let me search for recipes. When you type in the search for anything, nothing works. But if you want anything paid, of course, it would work because it's paid. It used to be my go-to app for everything but it‚Äôs unusable. I lost everything I had. My recipes, my saved shopping list, everything with every single update because they want you to buy a top chef, or subject yourself to something you don't want. USELESS."
806,806,5,2020-11-05T05:34:23.000Z,Lady Vegan San,My Go To,"Yummly was my go to for recipes, but now I go to another site because it‚Äôs easy to transfer recipes from online to the other site. For instance if Yummly emails a group of recipes to me I have to go out sign in and then find a recipe on yummy it doesn‚Äôt go there immediately like it used to."
807,807,5,2020-10-11T17:28:25.000Z,Mab man,Great app,I love this app whenever I have food and need a quick meal I just type what I have and it comes up with some great recipes!!! I had to cook a vegetarian keto meal for family and I when I typed it in a variety of delicious recipes came up and were a crowd pleaser for everyone!!!! I highly recommend this app!!
808,808,5,2020-09-20T15:18:58.000Z,behehsjsbdbdjsbs,Best Recipe App Ever!,I have used and recommended Yummly for almost 6 years now. It just keeps getting better and easier to use. I love being able to save recipes and go back to ones I‚Äôve saved and loved. I would 100% recommend this app to anyone with any level of skill.
809,809,5,2020-08-27T16:35:24.000Z,kellboat,Best Recipes,"This app is so easy to use. Whether I want to find a type of dish or something using ingredients I have on hand, I am able to find something delicious to make. There are easy to advanced recipes which makes this my favorite cooking app. I would highly recommend."
810,810,5,2020-07-25T00:50:10.000Z,Rusti Savage,Never disappointed,"Absolutely in love with this app. The customisation options always filter me the most fantastic recipes, I love the weekly newsletter, and I find the general usability and visuals quite simple and refreshing. The weekly emails have inspired me as well, and I always tell everyone I can to add this app to their repertoire."
811,811,5,2020-04-25T16:00:54.000Z,k koponr,Love this app!,It has the best search results filter system! Not only does it ask you what you‚Äôre looking for but it asks you what you‚Äôre NOT looking for. Yummly is ahead of the curve! It is also super diverse and even has recipes from various cultures that other recipe platforms do not have. Very impressive Yummly !
812,812,5,2020-04-09T05:13:02.000Z,Opierod6000,Most used app on my phone!,Yummly is so incredibly useful. I honestly have become a MUCH better cook since using it.  It is extremely easy to use and contains an entire world of recipes.  I really enjoy cooking for my family.  Go figure a 48yr old male that looks forward to family meals.  Thank you Yummly!
813,813,4,2020-04-22T18:12:23.000Z,J9sofyne,Can‚Äôt look up specific recipes,"The recipes I have found are great but you can‚Äôt look up specific things. I put in that I don‚Äôt eat meat and I keep getting a lot of chicken dishes recommended. You have to do a lot of scrolling to find items you are interested in but I will say, I‚Äôve tried about 20 and they were all rather good."
814,814,5,2020-03-22T12:27:48.000Z,OK Cook,To Go Cookbook,I use Yummly regularly.  I have cookbooks but it is so handy that I rarely use the books unless it is a family recipe.  I found a Beef and Noodles crockpot recipe that was simple and tasted great   I look for a lot of crockpot recipes as I work all day and the last thing I want to do is spend my evening cooking and cleaning up. Thanks Yummly.
815,815,5,2020-02-27T00:20:01.000Z,Xlashee,My favorite cooking app,"I rarely write reviews but this app is fantastic!  I have cooked for most of my life....BUT, I need a recipe.  I may tweak it, a bit, but I am not one to whip things together."
816,816,1,2020-03-20T11:16:10.000Z,Disappointed new user 1988888,Food restrictions,"Well, I have a few food intolerances that are I have to be serious about avoiding. When I downloaded the app, it asks about the things you cannot eat. The first two recipes I open up after it ‚Äúsearched recipes to fit my tastes and needs‚Äù both had two of the three ingredients that make me very sick. I downloaded it because it‚Äôs marketed as customizable and it was the opposite of that right out of the gate! I was so exited to have an app that showed me only recipes I didn‚Äôt have to worry about modifying. üò°"
817,817,5,2019-11-10T18:38:12.000Z,Jimmysuperflysnooka1989,I love Yummly!,"This app is my go-to for finding recipes, keeping the ones I‚Äôve made or am going to make. There is no shortage of choices- from drinks to desserts and everything in between. It also makes my shopping lists so I know what ingredients I actually need. Try Yummly, you just can‚Äôt go wrong."
818,818,4,2019-10-04T20:21:57.000Z,Melifried,"I like this this app, except...","I use this app several times a week! Great recipes & ideas. Don‚Äôt like that I don‚Äôt have access to everything (like the ‚Äúcelebrity chef‚Äù recipes. That parts annoying bc a lot of them sound better than the recipes that are free. I won‚Äôt pay for the extra content though, it‚Äôs probably not worth it."
819,819,2,2019-10-30T21:06:24.000Z,Fittzwing,Painfully Time-consuming,"Ok, so I find a recipe via DuckDuckGo and am encouraged on my iPad to download the app.  I reluctantly do that to access the recipe directions.  I skip the personalization and try to download the directions with the result that I have white screen.  I personalize the app, and still end up with a white screen (after learning that to see the recipe at all, I had to remove sugar from my personalization).  So for an hour of trying, I still don‚Äôt have recipe instructions."
820,820,5,2018-05-11T14:58:23.000Z,Mamberm1424,Super Useful!,"There has never been a time that I needed a recipe for something and couldn‚Äôt find it! Being able to save them and have a little collection of favorites has made my life so much easier, along with the ability to filter based on my dietary restrictions."
821,821,5,2018-08-07T22:08:01.000Z,Quiksilver_95,Inspiration when I need it!,"Love this app-whenever I don‚Äôt know WHAT to make or don‚Äôt know HOW to make something, Yummly has my back. It‚Äôs easy to find recipes for every occasion & dietary preference. And recipes are easy to save and find again. I can even find recipes to utilize whatever I happen to have on hand!"
822,822,5,2018-08-09T15:40:22.000Z,Pamg44,Best app ever,I love Yummly.  I love the fact that I can put in a recipe I want to make and I get the version for vegan/plant based option.  There are so many recipes it‚Äôs hard to choose.  I love the shopping list and the ability to use a calendar to prepare a recipe and it reminds me when to start prepping and cooking.  This is the best app ever.
823,823,5,2018-08-19T13:16:41.000Z,MNicetune,Awesome app!,"A lifesaver for a busy working mom of 3! So many options of meals, sides, drinks and treats. I absolutely love the shopping list I can create from the meal plan!! Best idea ever!! I just got the app last week and I have planned ALL dinners from it! Husband works late during this time of year and really likes the new variety of meals I‚Äôm making."
824,824,5,2018-12-25T17:59:04.000Z,Tom Richmondva,"Great app, store recipes, find new ones easily","Love this app, will store recipes In customizable categories, will offer suggestions based on previous recipes stored or used.  Some have videos to help the less experienced chef of the household.  There are likes to help determine what you may want to try."
825,825,5,2019-02-03T18:55:57.000Z,JoeP70!,Best Recipe App,I use Yummly all the time!  I use it when unsure what to make for dinner.  I use it when I need a new passing dish for a dinner party.   I use it to find new recipes or a twist on a classic dish for the holidays.  So many great ideas to choose from and then a great system to file them away for when you are ready to make.
826,826,5,2019-09-22T23:04:31.000Z,Irie03,Fantastic recipe app,"I love this app. I use it for most of my recipes weekly. It‚Äôs super easy to use, easy to modify settings and filter what sort of recipes you see. I love that they send me a weekly email of suggestions for me. It has helped me immensely sticking to my meal plans and finding healthy recipes. Love and highly recommend!"
827,827,5,2021-02-17T04:54:08.000Z,dee eliz,Easy Peasy,"Recipes. Are always easy to follow, yummy to look at and delish to eat. Never had a problem trying to make one. And sooooo many to choose from. The best part.... never have to do a lot of signing in to see the recipe. Just open it up and there it is. Way to go Yummly!!! I love your site."
828,828,3,2021-07-29T17:42:07.000Z,TJKY,Hard to Navigate- Awkward,There are some great recipes on here but the app is just so awkward to use. I click on a pic of something I want to make and it just enlarges the pic. I finally figured out you have to swipe to find a sub menu to open the recipe. A lot of unnecessary paragraphs of useless info from whoever put the recipe in. Can‚Äôt get the print button to do anything. It‚Äôs just not user friendly.
829,829,2,2020-12-31T00:57:37.000Z,Eric Staples,Downloaded to deleted in 5 minutes,"The profile setup and filter suggestions are incredibly annoying and intrusive, but forgivable. I think the app is trying to do too much and gather too much data upfront and thus alienates those who, like myself, simply want to search for a recipe."

I don‚Äôt feel limited in recipes, the recipes use normal ingredients and are  written by normal people for normal cooks and levels. Great app that gets updated pretty regularly; the admin people are also available and responsive."
832,832,5,2020-11-01T21:01:00.000Z,.salad,Great app!,"It encompasses so many different websites in one thing. I love the accuracy of the food rating and how popular the dish type is. But my absolute favorite feature would have to be how I can find dishes based on the ingredients I have, I can add or take away ingredients and it‚Äôll auto-populate more meals."

Yummly has certainly been a great source for finding those recipes. You can customize and even search as new ideas come up. Very user friendly and can find any type of recipe I‚Äôm in search of. Thanks Yummly!!!!
834,834,4,2020-08-26T02:48:11.000Z,Willyouhelp?,"Dear Yummly,","I‚Äôve been enjoying Yummly for years now and find it very inspiring. Just one more thing would make it perfect. It really should state what a serving size is. It‚Äôs impossible to figure out if 12 servings equals 1/3 cup each or 3/4 cup each. This is important information needed to supply the correct total calories, carbs, and protein  your family needs.        Thanks Yummly !!"
835,835,5,2020-07-10T22:52:59.000Z,Wil from Ft. Lauderdale,Many Yummly Recipes are Yummy,"I have tried several recipes from Yummly and have almost never have been disappointed. It frequently offers different recipes for the same dish. Usually, I combine some of them and create my own and most of the time I come up with a delicious dish."

I can‚Äôt tell you hope many times I have searched the web and been directed to their site. I do wish you would not be taken from the site to see the directions, but it still does not take this from being a5 star app!!"
837,837,5,2020-04-15T15:56:38.000Z,Aquarian_King,Great to find a new Recipe,I‚Äôve made many great recipes using Yummly and satisfied many tummys! The recipes are always detailed and straightforward and the best thing about the experience is how much variety you get just from typing in a single ingredient. I have also made of these recipes my own.
838,838,5,2020-04-13T22:08:06.000Z,Swimmer4Ev3r,Great!,I love this app! It makes it super easy to find meals and especially love that you can scan the foods you have and finds things to make with it.

839,839,4,2020-03-15T20:23:06.000Z,TechSavvyGrannie,Good reminders,"Good reminders for old favorites; helpful ideas for expanded menus. Some top line ingredients lists have typos, omitted ingredients, and duplicate ingredients.  Scrolling through the unnecessary and narcissistic verbiage and repetitious photos to get to the actual recipe on each blog is tedious and annoying. But not YUMMLY‚Äôs problem.  I detest videos.  I can read faster and text is easy to re-see."

841,841,5,2019-02-07T16:23:19.000Z,kimbunk,Convenient streamlined App,I love this app. It has simplified my life. No more running to the store with sheets of paper and handwritten grocery lists. I love that I can plan my menu and make my shopping list in one place and check off my shopping list as I shop in store or online. It makes eating paleo easier!

A great tool to make cooking a lot easier. I really like the fact you can add ingredients you already have at home to find recipes also.
844,844,5,2020-03-10T04:01:51.000Z,Zoobaby8885,Lots of recipes.,I learned about this app from my son Mike. I have found many recipes to try and have tried many.  I have found many that have gone into my monthly menu. The coconut cream sauce has been my last favorite. Many have asked for my recipes. Thank you so much for this app.

Everyday I get more and more, I am so overwhelmed because they look scrumptious and I don‚Äôt know what to do first. In the winter months it is so great to have these wonderful recipes and enjoy making then and sharing with family and friends."

I am a former caterer and have prepared hundreds of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I have over 200 cookbooks, yet the the majority of the time I find the recipe I‚Äôm looking for on Yummly.  Yummly is an absolute must for both my professional and personal cooking."

When I called support their only solution was to send them a list of the ones I didn‚Äôt want. I have 10-15 recipes that I don‚Äôt want anymore and cannot get them removed. I‚Äôm not sending a list every time I want something removed"
849,849,5,2019-08-04T21:11:23.000Z,NaSamp,I Love Yummly,"I use Yummly everyday no joke. I‚Äôm always looking for different ways to make a recipe to keep it new and fresh. Yummly hasn‚Äôt disappointed me yet. Wide selection, options to filter what you‚Äôre looking for, and you can filter recipes based off your lifestyle and medical conditions. The app is the just that darn good."
850,850,5,2017-10-28T14:13:34.000Z,hartykry,Lifesaver,I never use a cookbook anymore. This is all i need. I love that you can pick recipes that you like based on reviews and ingredients you have. I also LOVE the new function where you can type in a couple ingredients you have and search for tons of recipes that include those! So amazing!
851,851,4,2017-12-10T21:45:16.000Z,TessRS,great at finding recipes I like,Whatever algorithm Yummly uses is great at knowing what I like (though I should say that I like just about everything!). My one complaint is that the app doesn‚Äôt always pull the ingredient lists correctly from the websites where the recipes come from. So I tend to use Yummly as a search tool and not actually make recipes in-app.
852,852,5,2018-06-29T16:49:27.000Z,jocro23,LOVE this app!,"Cooking is very new to me, and this app makes everything SO easy. Plenty of delicious selections to choose from, and not only can you read all nutritional facts but you can even buy the ingredients through the app. This makes crappy cookers like me look like they really know what they‚Äôre doing. :)"
853,853,5,2018-07-06T17:37:19.000Z,Llhdc,Every recipe at your fingertips,"This is a very easy to use, all encompassing app. I‚Äôve yet to search for any recipe and come up empty.  By pulling recipes from different sites, this app lets you choose from a vast network.  The overview shows ingredients needed, then reroutes to that recipes website for directions.  I love it"
854,854,4,2018-07-07T19:58:21.000Z,Kaylayhai,Yummly is the BEST,"I always look for my recipes on Yummly first. I especially love that I can specify what ingredients I need to use that day. The schedule eat time function is a little silly though because I take my time cooking. And the ‚ÄúScheduled and Made‚Äù recipe list that continues to be made, and I don‚Äôt like it being automatically created. BUT, fabulous collection of recipes nonetheless."
855,855,5,2018-07-08T16:08:39.000Z,Gianni's M,What‚Äôs for dinner?,"Love this app! As a working single mother, I‚Äôm usually running in eight different directions. I‚Äôm not a fan of eating out much and I‚Äôm very careful with what I eat and what I feed my son. That being said, this app makes ‚Äúwhats for dinner?‚Äù Easier to answer since I can cook up something great within the hour."
856,856,2,2018-07-29T13:44:50.000Z,Direction Less,Mixing Reviews,"Like getting the recipes, bu get pretty frustrated with trying to find the directions after the list of ingredients. Wish there wasn‚Äôt as much verbiage & that the whole recipe with directions would pop up all at once. I do enjoy seeing recipes grouped together like the InstaPot or slow cooker recipes and categorized as Paleo, Low Carb & gluten free & sugar free. That has been a great help.  But sometimes I just give up because the actual directions are so hard to find."
857,857,5,2018-12-12T17:15:05.000Z,Hike Naked,Great for what you have,Have been using this app for years now. The best part about this is that you can put in the ingredients that you have or that you want to eliminate and it will narrow down recipes to fit those preferences. Website is also pretty nice to have in hand too.
858,858,5,2019-01-13T04:08:13.000Z,johnny trip,Fantastic app so far! Would like a dark mode,LOVE the app so far! The only thing I would like to see in the near future is a dark mode option in settings where the recipes and stuff are white on black. Easier on the eyes for some people. I see it a lot in news app settings.
859,859,5,2019-01-19T12:37:15.000Z,Buddy. C,Yummly‚Äôs The Best,"Yummly is the best recipe app I have ever seen. They have a HUGE collection of recipes for any occasion‚Äîbreakfast, lunch or dinner; parties, family gatherings or snacks; meat vegetables or desserts; soups, salads or drinks. They have made me a better cook with a variety had never dreamed of before getting the Yummly app. I would recommend this app to anyone from the beginner to the gourmet cook."
860,860,5,2020-12-18T18:28:23.000Z,Alisha967,Love!!,Since downloading this app I have found many new recipes.  I no longer even glance at my other apps because it seems that yummly has all the recipes from my other apps!  I love the shopping list option as well. If you like to cook this is your app!
861,861,3,2021-06-15T15:49:59.000Z,Gleecardog,Love it!,"This is the best food app ever! I use it daily. I also use AnyList to transfer and store recipes. Its cumbersome because one has to paste the steps into AnyList. I wish Yummly would fix that. Also when they solicit emails, the links to the dishes never work. So why waste time sending something that can‚Äôt be linked? Otherwise I really love Yummly but I wish they would fix these things in their app."
862,862,5,2020-09-28T20:39:04.000Z,Faithta,Most Amazing App,"I love, love this App! My life has been made easy! I hated to cook and found allot of recipes to be way over my skill set.  This app makes cooking easy and delicious! I type in what I have in my fridge or pantry and I always find a recipe to make without having to go to the store.....I tell everyone about Yummly!"
863,863,5,2020-09-02T01:52:32.000Z,ChefWesC,"Best Recipe Site, Hands Down","If it has been prepared and eaten, Yummly has recipes for it. What I like best is finding multiple recipes for the dish I want to cook, and being able to choose one that sounds particularly yummy and is a good match for what I have in the fridge and pantry.  Many of our favorite dishes now are Yummly finds."
864,864,3,2020-09-26T14:45:37.000Z,cgoorley,Yes and no,"I find that it‚Äôs time consuming to get to all the information I need for a recipe. Once I am interested, I need to  print it out for user friendly instructions. The buffalo chicken dip was good but too salty for our taste.  A similar casserole was good, however my husband didn‚Äôt go back for more so that won‚Äôt be made again. Today we‚Äôre trying the carne al Pastor tacos. If these aren‚Äôt a keeper, I‚Äôll stop subscription."
865,865,5,2020-07-06T18:44:58.000Z,funfoods for 4,Love!!,Love this app.  We have made so many recipes and they are a huge success.  It helps to not have the same recipes over and over with fresh ideas that make things fun.    My kids even look through it and pick recipes for us to try as a family
866,866,4,2020-08-21T17:59:43.000Z,ShebDawn,Amazing AP!  Best thing I have found!  Meal Planning Made Easy,This is amazing!  Used it to plan meals this week.  Made shopping easy...
867,867,5,2020-06-14T22:21:44.000Z,Slappy taste,Amazing app,I love this app and I get hungry every time I use it because I just can‚Äôt stop imagining myself eating all the delicious food it has. The one thing I wish was better is to share recipes and print them off easily but it may be because I haven‚Äôt used this app that much. üòÜüòåüòÉ
868,868,5,2020-05-23T05:37:56.000Z,Vonphit,Nice,"Awesome and organized. The pictures help out a lot so it can show us what a finished product looks like. I love this app because I can search by ingredient and find different recipes. For example if I need to cook some ground turkey- I can look that up and find different recipes that utilize the turkey. Love, love, love!"
869,869,5,2020-05-20T01:47:44.000Z,DebsaBee,So much variety!,"For years, I have been able to find good recipes here, no matter what I was looking for. I‚Äôve even increased my family‚Äôs ‚Äúfavorites by request list‚Äù."
870,870,5,2019-03-11T17:27:33.000Z,Vet Tech Rose,Recipes,Sometimes the recipes are in metric terms so I have to convert. And it‚Äôs annoying having to scroll through all the blogging when I just need to see the recipe. Other than that I love how if I come up with something I‚Äôd like to cook but don‚Äôt know how there‚Äôs always a recipe available.
871,871,5,2019-03-21T13:16:35.000Z,hiho1111,Good ideas,I usually go to Yum first for ideas on what to make for dinner. I‚Äôm bad at planning for a menu and sticking to it but I usually have an odd group of ingredients around. I can almost always find a recipe that will fit and tastes good. I have had very few ‚Äúfails‚Äù using the recipes I find on this site.
872,872,4,2019-05-15T14:25:32.000Z,Chell Hawkins,I love this app,My wife has a strangely specific diet and before this app we couldn‚Äôt find recipes that work. Being able to filter for anything helps so much. My one complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt always totally adhere to the filters. It would be nice if they had a ‚Äúthese ALMOST fit‚Äù warning before those recipes start.
873,873,5,2020-03-15T01:19:04.000Z,Dalmatian Jake,Great recipes,Love Yummly! Refer to everyone looking for recipes. My one huge problem is logging in. Why do I have to go through putting in email and password? Time consuming and extremely annoying! I want to touch the icon and see immediately recipes to look at !!!!!!!!!!!
874,874,4,2020-04-12T14:34:13.000Z,ErsieD,"Great variety, buggy functionality",Searching and storing recipes is great. Recommendations make sense. Gettiing to the actual recipe how to‚Äôs is often a pain because this is a compiler website so the info provided is in multiple formats based on the poster who wrote the segment. Lots of room for improvement but the potential to be a great resource is definitely there.
875,875,5,2019-07-27T00:09:23.000Z,Danielle1!,Yummm is right!,I have a medical condition that has caused me to broaden my horizon when it comes to my diet. Yummly helps me explore recipes that I would never have found on my own. I like the filters and how it asks me questions on what I‚Äôm looking for.  Dry helpful when u don‚Äôt even know How to ask for help on a diet plan.
876,876,3,2020-02-02T05:07:57.000Z,t-bird1111,Love/Hate Relationship,"I would love to make Yummly my primary go to for organizing recipes, meal planning, and grocery list making. I love being able to add ingredients to my shopping list right in the recipe!"
877,877,4,2020-01-05T20:08:23.000Z,Elkeheid,Aspiring to Become a Better Cook,"I love the variety of low fat vegan recipes Yummly offers.  You could say that my cooking skills are higher than the average American, and, because if that, I prefer to learn  from cooks that know more than me.  Sometimes, some recipes seem to be from cooks who have not made a dish enough times to make their best version of their recipe."
878,878,4,2019-07-24T20:04:41.000Z,SaraSmart,Almost perfect,"I love the customizable features and the fact that you can tell it what you have currently and it will find recipes for you. I like to keep track of my protein intake. It would be great if you had an option for ‚Äúhigh protein‚Äù since you already have options for ‚Äúlow fat‚Äù, ‚Äúlow carb‚Äù, ‚Äúlow calorie‚Äù, and ‚Äúhigh fiber‚Äù"
879,879,4,2019-07-18T20:57:18.000Z,GodessB10,Love but wish,"I really love this app for the versatility in recipes of all diet types. It really has helped with my transition to the vegan lifestyle! The only thing I wish I could do is save the recipes in a place to come back to later bs typing in search bar for it in hopes I can find again. Also, some video of how to make for beginner oilers would be a great add on:)"
880,880,4,2018-07-12T13:28:38.000Z,Poetinmypocket,Yum,"By far the best recipes app for those of us wanting to explore new and exciting food. So helpful to finding worldly cuisine and being able to create a shopping list. When going to the local store ingredients are easy to find, as when your memory fails and hand written notes are lost. Comfort in knowing stored recipes are on my phone."
881,881,5,2018-08-09T20:30:58.000Z,_IStoleYourSenpai_,Spectacular app,"I‚Äôve been able to find so many great recipes on this app and I love the features that it has like, you can tell it what ingredients you have and it‚Äôll give you recipes with only the ingredients you listed! You should definitely give this a shot!"
882,882,4,2018-08-30T23:32:15.000Z,blah bla bl v,starving college student,"I just started college with my new apartment so this has been a lifesaver with figuring out what to eat and uh, how to cook. the only thing is I don‚Äôt have an oven and only one stove top and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to filter it so that it doesn‚Äôt give me recipes that needs an oven or simultaneous cooking. But besides that it‚Äôs been super good and useful and a life saver."
883,883,5,2018-10-01T17:55:59.000Z,Irisb693,Love the app,This app has saved me out of a few jams. We get tired of the same old dinners so this app has given me recipes to expand our palettes. Thank you for creating something so easy to use that even my 10yr old daughter can use it and has. We had very creative desserts this summer.
884,884,4,2018-10-07T23:30:49.000Z,TheNoBSgirl,Love this app!!,"I use this app all the time! Like another user mentioned I don't like the fact that you have to navigate away to get the actual recipe, but I've gotten used to it. I haven't had any issues. I like the fact that you can create different headings to store recipes under. Makes it easier. I definitely recommend!"
885,885,3,2018-10-13T13:17:21.000Z,Southernpecan22,Could be better but I like it,I like the way the app works and there are a lot different recipes to choose from. However I would like to be able to see my meals by current week inside the app instead of having to view them in my calendar. I would also like to see the meals I have already made be removed from my schedule but not from my yums. It‚Äôs a good free meal planning app.
886,886,5,2018-11-01T22:25:38.000Z,Maggielouize,Proud user for years,"This app is a staple in my life. I have been using it for like 5 years if not longer. I have allergies, food preferences and what not so this app is great for customizing and filtering recipes to fit my needs. Hundreds of recipes pop up as soon as you type in a couple ingredients."
887,887,5,2018-11-13T00:18:26.000Z,sunnysherri,My favorite app!,"I‚Äôm not even sure how I stumbled upon this app, but I sing its praises all of the time.  It‚Äôs easy to use and offers a variety of recipes for anything you can name.  I previously had ‚Äúlimited‚Äù kitchen skills, but have grown much more comfortable and creative in my cooking ever since I started using Yummly.  Love it!!"
888,888,1,2018-12-23T16:47:30.000Z,Woody_this,Somethings wrong not user friendly,I will get emails from Yummly about new recipes. Once I click on it I get transferred to a web browser and at the top is a link to install the app. I already have the app and it should automatically bring me to that app. So I‚Äôll click anyway and then I get to the app. But where‚Äôs the recipe I wanted to see in the first place. Back in the web browser. So if I really want to see the recipe and possibly save it I need to search for it. Yummly can do better because other app are.
889,889,4,2019-01-28T15:42:15.000Z,Klmjwt,Great app but missing feature,I love this app but the description and intro after downloading say you can scan ingredients that you have for dish ideas. I have searched through the entire app and this feature can not be found. It was the main reason I downloaded it. But overall the app is wonderful.
890,890,5,2017-10-07T20:36:22.000Z,almtk,Love this app,The best recipe app out there. I love all the recommendations it gives me and especially love the filter function on search. I use this app almost every day.
891,891,5,2018-06-13T22:41:50.000Z,Resolved in Reno,Basically Pinterest for just food,I‚Äôve only been using it a few days but I do love that the recipes are built into the app and easy to search through. Other great features are that it syncs with my iCal and creating your own boards to add organize recipes into.
892,892,5,2021-01-08T05:46:19.000Z,Be a Holyroller,Great Find,I have been using this for awhile and have found it really helps me to find most everything I‚Äôve tried to find in the Big Books that‚Äôs left me flat. I like the way it is laid out and it‚Äôs great for quick meals as well as the hard to find oldies.
893,893,3,2021-03-13T17:21:39.000Z,RealNenny,"Great recipes, dumb moderators","I loved the app until I got banned from posting. Anyone ever watch ‚ÄúF*** That‚Äôs Delicious‚Äù on Viceland? I said that with the asterisks to self censor it after making an amazing Palak Paneer and these puritans banned me from commenting. First of all they‚Äôre no fan of food. They would get the reference. Secondly, I bleeped it! This app has great recipes. Too bad it‚Äôs run by nuns. Dorks! Your mom is a b**** and so are you lol. Are you gonna tell on me? Go home to your mommy ya cowards"
894,894,5,2021-01-02T21:34:14.000Z,EJ713,Brillant gem for sparking your own cooking creativity,"I don‚Äôt remember how I found the app, but I‚Äôm so glad I did. I love that you can variations of recipes for a dish. Some of the recipes are embedded in cooking articles which is great, but sometimes you simply want the ingredients and directions. No complaints from me!"
895,895,5,2020-11-08T18:56:13.000Z,Krissieghosty,I LOVE THIS APP,I just recently chose to live a vegetarian lifestyle and this app has every recipe I need to execute this transition much easier! Also the cooking is so so so much fun and so far I haven‚Äôt had a bad recipe yet! I just go off the recipe with a few choice option and it comes out perfect! Beautiful app. Worth the money!
896,896,5,2020-09-16T12:20:24.000Z,Manger Granger,Good App,"It is an easy app to access and has great receipes.  Someone said seemed not to be able to save the receipes.  Once a receipe is open you just need to click on the 3 dimensional square and save to your account.  It will ask you if you want to save as a dinner, lunch or breakfast or dessert.  It is a very helpful app."
897,897,5,2020-07-14T11:49:41.000Z,mfb8248,Perfect every time!,This is my favorite app ! I can absolutely always find what I need and have lots of choices to choose from . The best is being able to mark it as a favorite and it goes in my on file ! I love to cook and bake and you have given me so many new ideas!
898,898,5,2020-04-04T02:24:10.000Z,Veronica_k573,Great,It‚Äôs really awesome especially if your trying to find healthy meals it literally has anything you could think of but I just with they would show their serving sizes as 1 and not like 4 so I don‚Äôt have to divide the ingredients and if I need more servings it would just be easier to multiply
899,899,4,2020-06-30T18:43:19.000Z,BeastieBurd,Change the shopping list feature back,Please change this feature the way you had it. It was much easier to look at a recipe for the ingredient you bought instead of changing the view your screen & pushing a few more buttons
900,900,5,2018-01-05T16:22:47.000Z,MizcurlyB,I love this app!,"I absolutely love this app! This app lets you plan your meals, make a shopping list Or you can use items you already have on hand. It even tells you when to start cooking the food so it will be finished in time for dinner. Forget Pinterest this is where my love is! üòò"
901,901,2,2018-10-09T19:31:22.000Z,Tahirih Says,"Would have been 5 stars, but...","The new format makes it so I can‚Äôt listen to music on my phone while using this app. Makes searching through recipes a lot less fun. Makes cooking irritating, because I have to play records or switch to music on my computer. Hassle. Still, lots of recipes here. Several for random dietary restrictions, too. I‚Äôd do 5 stars instead of 2, but getting to have music in the background while I cook is THAT important to me."
902,902,5,2018-12-10T16:30:10.000Z,johnny monger,Super useful,"Very practical, with a streamlined interface. Easy to find and collect quality recipes from the huge amount of websites that Yummly draws from. Integrated shopping list is very easy to use. My saved recipes are easy to view. Basically every time I cook, I use this app."
903,903,4,2019-04-03T20:51:31.000Z,bettys boy,Male in the Kicthen,It‚Äôs been great using Yummly I research recipes that I find appealing then save them after I test them to see if they are as good as they look on the pictures. I use the App quite frequently the only downside to it is I can‚Äôt put old recipes I have accumulated over the years. If they ever change that then it would be 5 stars
904,904,5,2020-03-04T02:23:55.000Z,TheCook2020,Love this app,"I‚Äôve Lost 58 lb since I have been using this app. The discovery of spices and tastes have been amazing. My whole family are involved in meal planning. The one thing I wish is I could move around my collection, I made it the days of the week. It would be nice to put them in order"
905,905,5,2019-09-22T17:10:22.000Z,J-Stretch,Yumazing!!,I truly love that this is still absolutely free. It has so many different recipes that can be found. I‚Äôve been looking for an app that offered truly free search of recipes to try at home and this is that app. Thank you Team at Yummly for keeping this free for users to enjoy like myself!!!
906,906,5,2019-09-19T13:57:35.000Z,megstamby,My most helpful app!,"I use Yummly every week as I sit down to plan my meals. I love how it filters by diets and gives seasonal suggestions. And unlike other recipe apps, everything I‚Äôve ever made from Yummly has turned out just as the bloggers said it would.  No unrealistic meals that are impossible to execute."
907,907,5,2019-09-17T03:59:49.000Z,Limeypenny,Best recipes easy to use app.,I have tried many apps this one has great recipes as few ingredients or as fancy as you choose to be. Good vegan selection as I have one in the house which can be challenging. Find I can make vegan sides and main courses the whole family can enjoy.
908,908,5,2020-12-31T22:20:02.000Z,Allison13v,Best app on my devices yet!,"With the limited dining out options during this pandemic..., this app has the most amazing filter and you can use whatever you have at home!   I have only come across one recipe in my 80 something YUMs that didn‚Äôt turn out well!"
909,909,4,2021-06-07T23:27:51.000Z,Leyandra,"Great app, perfect for finding new recipes",Yummly is a great app and is always coming out with updates. The only inconvenient thing is that it takes you to the websites that post the recipe instead of staying in app (to respect the source of the recipe) but it can be difficult to navigate. Otherwise it‚Äôs very helpful and has lots of great recipes!
910,910,5,2020-12-07T16:19:22.000Z,LavaLips1,My Favorite Recipes,I highly recommend this app! If you love to cook or if you just like looking at pretty food pics - this is a must have. Just about any category of food you can think of making is found here. So what are you waiting for? Download now!
911,911,5,2020-11-10T14:13:39.000Z,CDR Mom,Not perfect but the best one I‚Äôve found,One stop recipe finder with direct to calendar scheduling and shopping list builder.
912,912,4,2020-11-23T13:10:35.000Z,Foyetoo,Great to find and categorize,"The app makes it so easy to find and track and categorize recipes. I love being able to make my ""try soon"" list, my ""healthy snacks,"" and so on. There are so many ways to find something good to eat! Filtering by ingredient and diet style are also excellent ways to find a dish that appeals to my whole family."
913,913,5,2020-08-01T17:49:10.000Z,jesears13,My Go-To Recipe Source,Yummly is absolutely the best resource for finding recipes especially for people with dietary restriction or food allergies. I can always find excellent recipes to share at family gatherings and know that my food is safe for my family members who can't have certain foods.
914,914,4,2020-09-01T16:38:14.000Z,Mavdoc,Easy phone Access to Recipes,"Many good recipes, however the authors of the recipes often get too wordy in their explanations, and their personal lives before you you can access the directions. But good app nonetheless. Limit the information in the app other than the ingredients and directions!"
915,915,5,2020-05-13T15:50:52.000Z,Yogi@heart‚ù§Ô∏è,Great recipes,Yummly is a great resource for meal planning. It has many different recipes that cater to specific dietary needs and even includes an easy to use shopping list! It has helped me streamline the process of  shopping and prepping dinners for the week as well as choose great recipes for special occasions!
916,916,3,2020-08-01T01:34:00.000Z,sail mates,Really like App,One of the best Recipe apps I have used. Enormous number of recipes and cuisines to choose from.
917,917,4,2020-07-10T17:12:01.000Z,Scatrod,Love it!,"This is a great app. My husband introduced it to me and I've found so many great recipes with it. I love that you can filter by diet, calories, ingredients I DONT want, etc. My favorite thing to do is to type in a few items I have and then see what recipes pop up. Only thing I think it needs are videos. If it does, I haven't seen any..."
918,918,5,2020-04-09T13:03:38.000Z,is tgereanamenittaken,Life Saver,This is a great app. So many times you are looking for something different to cook but are in a hurry. The recipes are right there with easy instructions. And there are variations of the same recipe which is fun to read. So you can borrow from one if another doesn‚Äôt fit your taste buds.
919,919,4,2020-04-20T23:03:53.000Z,11kel66,Love this resource!,I have been using Yummly for quite a few years! I am always able to find something that suits my taste of the day! I love to cook and it has tons of options to choose from. And being able to pick very specifically what I want! I love all types of Asian food..and I like how you can pick individual ingredients!
920,920,5,2019-05-31T16:14:30.000Z,Aerissa,Yummly,"I love Yummly, I can find easy keto recipes here that don‚Äôt call for crazy ingredients. A lot of the recipes ask for ingredients I keep in my kitchen so a lot of the time I just need to get 1-2 things from the store to make any recipe. There are also some more complex recipes if you‚Äôre into that as well."
921,921,5,2020-02-11T16:04:49.000Z,Cillabee,Excited to Have the App!,"I heard about it from a Nutritionist I am working with at health club, and I am excited to try the recipes I have received since joining recently- easy to use, geared for me per my profile and preferences, I am trying to do more meal prep and cook at home.  Doable and extremely tasty and healthful!"
922,922,5,2020-02-02T21:04:06.000Z,kagwood,UPDATE: This STILL is my most used app!,"UPDATE: I have consistently used this app for probably 5+ years. Never an issue, always great recipes to try, so simple to use. I recommend to EVERYONE!"
923,923,4,2020-02-10T22:03:17.000Z,Patsy D. 55,Yummly!!,I can‚Äôt count the number of times that I have gone to this app to find a recipe or a meal to cook for that evening.  Other times I just see something that looks so delicious I make a special trip to the store to get my needed ingredients. Yummly has a way of ‚Äúmaking ‚Äú me do that.  Thank you so much for making these recipes available!!                 P. Dwyerüòé
924,924,5,2019-08-26T20:47:55.000Z,MyNameisMyBusiness,Love this app!,"My husband has congestive heart failure, so I‚Äôm cooking fresh food for us, only without the salt. Yummly has proved invaluable in finding flavorful recipes without all the sodium (if there is salt in the recipe I just omit it). It‚Äôs worth it for the pan-seared tuna steak recipe alone! It‚Äôs not a dedicated ‚Äúlow sodium‚Äù app but it‚Äôs really good for finding quick and flavorful meals."
925,925,4,2019-12-14T04:36:51.000Z,mathiscm13,Yum!,Great app for recipe ideas‚Äîcan just put in ingredients and bam! Dinner ideas for the week!

I have started cooking much more often because it‚Äôs just too easy to hop on here, plug in an ingredient I may already have in the fridge I‚Äôd like to use and, tadaaaaa! Select one of many delicious options! Thank you Yummly!"

928,928,4,2019-07-06T03:09:45.000Z,BKSTUDD,Almost 5 star,"Love the app and make tons of meals of the recipes they offer. However, the only thing holding me back from a 5 star rating is how difficult it is to access the directions to some of the recipes.

929,929,5,2019-06-27T22:40:31.000Z,Awakening Dezign,My Go-To Recipe App,I really like this food app. It‚Äôs my app of choice for deciding what to make for dinner at the end of the day and in a pinch for ideas.
930,930,5,2018-05-31T10:05:21.000Z,labpuppy8,"Great App, Sooo Many Recipes!!","This app is such a great source for a variety of recipes from all over the internet. When I decide to make something or that I want to find a specific dish, nowadays my first look is through Yummly and not Google. 10/10 would recommend to anyone (and I have!!)"
931,931,5,2018-08-22T17:46:05.000Z,eli321578,"The best app for a beginner, but also for anyone who wants to learn to cook a new dish","The best for a beginner, but also for anyone who wants to learn to cook a different dish. I love this app and I tell many people to try it. Manny yummy dishes in this app. I give this app 5 stars. It also gives you a video, list of grocery, and step by step."
932,932,2,2018-12-09T15:41:51.000Z,Pecatti,No idea how to sort,"It should be easy to sort through recipes when doing a search. There is no reason I need to see hundreds of 9 vote recipes to finally see one that has 29k. If the option is even available, it is not easily seen. Sort by popularity would make this app worth it. As it stands, it‚Äôs broken for me and only the website is worth the effort to find new recipes. Use this when baking and have then saved."
933,933,5,2018-12-23T03:03:38.000Z,Dank_Sinatra86,So dope! Saucey! (Literally & Hypothetically speaking),This is the best food and drink app I‚Äôve ever seen! It has everything from breakfast to desserts to cocktails. Helps a lot when I don‚Äôt know what to make. So many good ideas and has options for every type of foodie out there. If I could give this app 100 stars I would.
934,934,5,2019-03-01T15:44:30.000Z,evapvd,Handy resource for all levels,"Even for vegetarians and the health conscious, this app is great! I can always find yummy options.

Just downloaded Yummly in hopes I could find more recipes for the genres that didn‚Äôt have many in epicurious. I love this app so much I actually deleted epicurious and only use Yummly. So major ups to the creators of it. I‚Äôve been a chef for 20 yrs.
936,936,5,2019-03-17T13:38:09.000Z,Geetarplaya,Yummly,"I love this app. I love cooking pretty much every meal, and food of all different ethnicities. Indian and Asian are my favorites.

940,940,5,2018-05-26T11:58:17.000Z,Nannypie2,Great app!,I love this app. It has saved me so many times when I needed a recipe for something new to try or when I want to just spice things up. It‚Äôs also great that I can save my favorites and those I want to give a try by using separate categories. I‚Äôve recommended Yummly to my friends!
941,941,5,2021-01-26T17:26:00.000Z,The walter Kronkite,My cooking has improved!!,I really enjoy this app! I can take something that I have in my kitchen or pantry and find the perfect recipe for it! My cooking has improved and my wife has taken note! I‚Äôm just following recipes on here and once I do it 3 or 4 times I start experimenting!
942,942,5,2021-01-04T17:57:15.000Z,Bren3rod,Love this app!!!,This is a great app to find recipes from basic to chef inspired! I recommended this app to my son because he's learning how to cook for himself and I would recommend it to everyone! It's easy to use and i love that it also shows the nutritional information for each recipe!
943,943,3,2021-01-15T13:40:30.000Z,Brianna Bass,I could be better,"This app is a great idea and works pretty smoothly, but I just downloaded it again looking for breakfast inspiration. Scrolled through about 50 individual pancake Recipes looking for something creative to eat... then deleted the app again. My eyeballs shouldn‚Äôt fall out of my head scrolling for some variety. There are too many of the same recipe on here."

I can fulfill my fantasy of being a Master Chef with one click of my Yummy Recipe App. Thank you Yummy. I Love you Yummy, but it seems that the upgraded app is super slow and frustrating, I like the old app better.

945,945,3,2020-12-11T12:11:22.000Z,bren1342,Eh it‚Äôs okay,"I really enjoy using the app, however a huge concern for me is saving my own recipes and editing recipes I have in my private sections. It‚Äôs annoying bc sometimes the recipes are not exact, like some are too soupy, too sweet, too salty, too thick, not thick enough, not sweet enough. It would be great if I could add in my own ingredients to the list of ingredients on my side which isn‚Äôt viewable to the public eye."

Guaranteed to find something new just by punching in one ingredient and filtering from there based upon questions from the app. 3 years running and loving how it constantly updates as well."

I DON‚ÄôT like that the ingredients and directions are not easily available on the same page‚Äîthis format is kind of a pain and could definitely use improvement."

If I‚Äôm out of ideas for what to cook for dinner, I open up Yummly and voila, I find a recipe I never would have thought of. You‚Äôll never use another recipe resource!"

957,957,4,2020-02-04T23:20:37.000Z,Rfiddyone,App developers please look into a couple of issues,1. Can‚Äôt delete multiple grocery list items quickly because the app often reorders items.
958,958,5,2019-11-13T23:29:39.000Z,loskeezy,I liked it enough to write a review,This app does really good to connect people with a wide variety of recipes. For a free app I was a little skeptical because nothing good is usually free. This app is great and I would recommend for people who don‚Äôt cook very often and even for avid cooks. Hope this helps
959,959,5,2019-11-06T03:02:11.000Z,AJoness22,Best recipe app!,It is tailored to your diet restrictions so you don‚Äôt have to think of your substitutions and the recipes are actually good and easy to follow. But the shopping list is probably my favorite! Separating items based on aisle ... makes my shopping trips much easier. My husband thanks you.
960,960,5,2018-03-19T00:55:05.000Z,reyona stiles,Freaking Amazing,I have literally introduced this app to all my cooking friends! Yummly hands down is my go to for any recipe. I love how I‚Äôm able to tweak the recipe and increase the servings sizes. It would be too cool if one could create a meal prep for like the week with a full grocery list for it and all. I swear I‚Äôd use this app 10x more.

If you only have a few measly things in the pantry or fridge, you can still make a great meal. It‚Äôs been quite the life saver for a college student such as myself."

LOVE how it creates ingredient lists for you, you can check em off as you add em to your grocery cart and will even let you make recipes with ingredients you should already have from previous shopping trips.  Different options too for different dietary preferences."
964,964,3,2018-11-26T15:01:52.000Z,Nico0827,Good app BUT,"I'm new to this tool and got it because I love to cook and wanted to try some new recipes. I went through and created some categories to save recipes under for easy retrieval. However, I've saved about 150 under Dinner and when I go back to look for them I only see about 20 even though it shows 150. I don't understand why I can't see all of what was saved."

Sometimes the ingredients measurements is incomplete and you have to return to beginning to see the ingredients list. You cannot print the entire recipe at once. Very annoying!"

969,969,3,2019-07-11T16:49:03.000Z,Will Wadsworth,Accessibility flaws:,Your app has various accessibility flaws for users with assistive technology. There is ambiguous information where buttons and other areas that need activation are unclear if you are using a screen reader or magnification program such as Zoom or voiceover. I encourage you to review application and web accessibility guidelines. Deque University and Web Accessibility consortium are a good start. Learn about WC3 Web accessibility standards.

I have some food allergies so it lets me chose the what allergies I have and it will try not to give me recipes with those foods in it. But overall amazing app!

Did that but now where are all the recipes I have saved for the past few years? How do I get them back? If they are gone will find another app that does what yours used to do so well. Have had requests to login in the past updates but could choose to not and still use the app now apparently you can‚Äôt access your past saved recipes.
974,974,5,2020-12-02T21:45:48.000Z,Luvtoboat,Great recipes!,Anytime I‚Äôve needed to find a recipe for something it‚Äôs always available.

I makes my decisions easy to make. The only but, that I find, is that, I have it programmed for keto recipes, and it gives me all kind of low carbs recipes. It is just a detail, but one most be aware of it,"

Sometimes you have to sign up to another site to actually download the recipe and I have not figured out a way to save the recipes I like simply.  I am not computer illiterate and the fact that there isn't a simple button to press to save is beyond me. I have spent way too much time trying to figure out how to work this app, more time than I have. It's a pity, the recipes look great."
991,991,1,2018-04-01T15:12:27.000Z,Ephemera Danica,Really annoying,"This app has a range of recipes but no single search facility as far as I can see. There are a number of really annoying features: it has so many ads popping up all the time it is impossible to read a recipe without inadvertently hitting one of the very annoying pop ups; there are no metric measurements! Come on guys, who on earth bakes with 10 tablespoons of butter! Even the use of cup measures is so imprecise and variable. Pity because there are a number of interesting recipes.

1001,1001,5,2020-12-26T16:30:46.000Z,MonkeyMcSpank,Can‚Äôt get much better,The only thing I would change about this app is that I would not have it mention the pro version every single time that the app is opened. I don‚Äôt have the budget to go pro at this time or I would.
1002,1002,2,2021-08-03T05:42:23.000Z,ChattEng,Features?,"All these test features make it more annoying than useful. It also makes the app very glitchy. Sorting through the searches are difficult to filter. I mean you can‚Äôt sort the recipes by the most yum‚Äôd. That‚Äôs best a long time complaint. Strange they haven‚Äôt fixed that yet because it‚Äôs a frequent complaint for quite a while‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll use, but it‚Äôs not that impressive as it was in the early years."
1003,1003,4,2021-03-16T18:00:57.000Z,Caliaska,A great app for finding recipes,A great app for finding recipes with filters to adjust to your dietary wants/needs. I‚Äôm rating this app four stars because now you cannot adjust the serving size amount. I think you would have to pay for the monthly to be able to adjust the serving size amount.
1004,1004,1,2021-02-28T05:05:52.000Z,kit-kat123345,Does the Pro version really support Family Sharing??????,"According to Yummly‚Äôs app features, it supports Family Sharing. However, my daughter on my family sharing plan, under my Apple ID, and she purchased the Pro Version. Unfortunately, it will not allow me access to Pro recipes.  A pop up prompts me to subscribe for Pro access and when I click YES , it tells me I‚Äôve already subscribed üò©Both of us have Gamily Sharing AND Share Subscriptions turned on. How do we resolve this problem?????"
1005,1005,2,2021-01-18T17:14:57.000Z,IV192838,Disappointed,"This was my FAVORITE app and have been using it for years. It was very user friendly, highly enjoyed all the ways I could filter what I was looking for and offered so many great options all in one place. Dropped down to 2 stars because now it‚Äôs an app you have to pay for in order to use at all. Very disappointed as this was my go to. Now I guess I will be going back to Pinterest."

I do some catering and Yummly is invaluable to me but also perfect for what to make the family for any meal. Highly recommend this over any other recipe site.

Yummly gives me so many options based on all of the above.  I can always find recipes that turn out great!  Thanks!"
1009,1009,5,2020-11-17T15:27:52.000Z,ShallanDevar,Just Awesome,This is a great way to find new recipes and try new food. Searches can be customized by ingredients and/or by food type. I‚Äôve found some great new recipes that are definitely keepers. If you‚Äôre looking to expand cooking skills and try new foods this is the place to be.

I found Yummly and it made cooking look easy and fun. I‚Äôve found some incredible recipes and I enjoy looking for new ones. Highly recommend this app."
1012,1012,4,2020-09-13T18:51:13.000Z,Momma Cray,Great Recipes,"A very good app. Has wonderful recipes. My only complaint would be that you can‚Äôt access certain recipes unless you upgrade to Yummly pro, but that will cost 4.99 a month. Although there is a free trial offer, I‚Äôm not sure I would want to spend the 4.99 a month to access a few extra recipes."
1013,1013,5,2020-07-13T17:16:55.000Z,Sionna0611,Yummly is my fav!,Yummly has been so helpful when cooking for my family. I have a lot of dietary restrictions and Yummly shows me all recipes that do not include the foods I cannot eat. It is awesome (it‚Äôs the little things üòâ). In addition the app is easy to use. I recommend Yummly to as many people as a I can.
1014,1014,5,2020-05-15T19:06:32.000Z,Bunnyrancher,My go-to cooking app,"If I want to look up a specific recipe, an ingredient, suggestions for a cooking style or, really, about any cooling question I have this is the first place I go. Easy to navigate, easy to understand. They source recipes from many cooks. I highly recommend it."

1016,1016,4,2020-05-13T08:30:40.000Z,Kynadre,Pairs great with web app,"This has been a go-to for me for a while now due to the pairing and filtering options on the desktop and then bookmarking recipes to pull up on the phone or tablet while cooking. I just wish some of those extra desktop options were here too, like sorting by most popular."
1017,1017,4,2020-04-25T12:14:41.000Z,adcoria,Good app,This app seems to collect recipes from the internet.  I have found it very useful looking for new ideas for meals.  It links you to the original recipe with on the internet but you do get the added feature of being able to see the ingredients from the app as well as ratings.
1018,1018,5,2020-03-25T10:34:35.000Z,Bulldog in Lipstick,Nothing‚Äôs wasted,Yummly is terrific. I have used this app for years and love it. It is especially helpful when you have one or two ingredients that you need to use up and haven‚Äôt a clue how. Pop one or both in the search and voila! - you are off to the kitchen.
1019,1019,4,2020-01-27T00:32:19.000Z,CPauls1212,Love the app,"Would be better if the main page wasn‚Äôt centralized around sweets and desserts. I only make dinner recipes, but it‚Äôs always showing smoothies & desserts."
1020,1020,1,2018-10-27T00:08:21.000Z,Vmw2009,Sign in issue,This app sort of did work until past couple of weeks. I dislike having to sign in each time. It‚Äôs a lengthy process.  Past couple of weeks I have not been able to get in app because of the sign in process.  When I go through the email verification process and into the website I have to sign in and start the process all over again.  Can‚Äôt get into the app.  Why do I need to sign into an app just to view recipes.  Am I doing something wrong?
1021,1021,5,2018-10-28T19:44:22.000Z,Captn Barnacles,Must Have Kitchen Tool,"It‚Äôs a very simple guide for recipes. Pretty much will find all versions of a recipe for a dish you‚Äôre trying to make which saves time hunting around. Home page is updated daily with fresh meal ideas. As a line cook, Yummly is my go-to guide for creating whichever dish I‚Äôm trying to prepare."
1022,1022,5,2018-11-28T02:04:30.000Z,DianeyMommy,A must have!,I‚Äôve never been disappointed by the Yummly app. I‚Äôve shared it with all my friends and now they too use it regularly. I love the feature that allows you to put in a few main ingredients you have on hand to find new dishes to whip up. Simply the best!
1023,1023,5,2018-12-05T04:46:16.000Z,RRH614,Love,This is by far my favorite out of the recipe apps I‚Äôve had downloaded in the past.
1024,1024,5,2018-12-13T02:40:21.000Z,usbankisacheapslut,Life saver,So much easier to cook healthy meals! Love that I can filter out ingredients as well as search for recipes that have a specific ingredient that I might need to use before it expires (or working with limited options until I go grocery shopping again).
1025,1025,5,2019-02-09T14:29:06.000Z,sukebath,"Delicious, easy-to-make recipes","I don‚Äôt really like to take the time to cook good meals, but I want my family to eat well.

Wow if I could make everything on here I would!!! Also a great way to learn how to cook. I learned a lot of things on here just by looking at how to make things. Again just WOW!!
1027,1027,5,2019-08-30T19:03:02.000Z,Rain.G,My most used app,I‚Äôve been using Yummly for years and it‚Äôs been such a great tool for me as I teach myself to cook. Its flexibility and ability to choose ingredients/time constraints makes it easy to find the perfect recipe. I‚Äôve yet to find a recipe app that is as useful and user friendly as Yummly!
1028,1028,3,2020-01-18T00:50:21.000Z,EllyHigginBottom,Like but....,I haven‚Äôt been able to log on to my account for a few months now. I click on where it is supposed to connect you and nothing happens. I can still search the recipes and it‚Äôs nice to able to scroll through all the pictures. But I can‚Äôt save anything or access all that I‚Äôve already saved and I really miss that.
1029,1029,5,2019-06-24T08:25:04.000Z,AffableAnnie,Great app,"Whether you want to try something different or get a new take on an old favorite, this is a great app. Of course not all the recipes are for my palate; but, most of what I‚Äôve tried have been absolutely delicious. I‚Äôve gotten many dishes I‚Äôve put on heavy rotation from this app."

This app helps me find recipes with ingredients I have on hand, or allows me to add them to the little shopping list feature. The prep, cook and serve time reminders are also a great help!"

You have allergies from certain foods? Yummly gives recipe options for that. You only like veggies? Same thing. And the idea for a grocery list section is magic. Great app."

I was using the Paprika app for years but this is more convenient. The only thing it‚Äôs missing is the ability to put in a web address & save from that.

It's okay but now filled with intrusive ads, and suggestions pop up while you're trying to read a recipe. Do these app makers not realize we just want to see the recipe? It's super-annoying to scroll and be inundated with ads!!"

You attempt to hold or highlight or click on them and it goes to that single ingredient.  You see a flash of an x for a moment, but you can‚Äôt hit it.  It just goes into that one ingredient.  PITA."

However, there are not a lot of reviews by others after making the recipe so, you typically will have to select one that sounds good without being able get much feedback from others.

I‚Äôm not to thrilled with pro though because its seems like more recipes that would usually be available will not be locked behind a pay wall.  Other than that it‚Äôs awesome.

But it doesn‚Äôt let you share from safari to Yummly, it also doesn‚Äôt import instructions. It imports ingredients, the. You click directions and it opens the website to scroll forever to find instructions. It‚Äôs sooo close to being great...but useless in the same token. Like a car without wheels."

What do I see spinach stuffed chicken breast, spinach Alfredo and chicken about 10% of the recipes I‚Äôm looking at have spinach in one form or another. Do I have to pay to get the filter to work? Does the filter work on the first row only? Well no that isn‚Äôt true that‚Äôs where the stuffed chicken breast with spinach lives. My luck with this app working for me is approaching 0."

We eat at home most nights and take our lunches to work so it's great to have an app that I can use filters to find what I need quickly.

1108,1108,1,2020-09-05T15:46:44.000Z,Zmmeo,Yummly review,I have had this App for a few years and had many saved recipes. Last week when I attempted to open the App to check a saved recipe it locked up and wouldn‚Äôt open. A window popped up to download ‚Äúthe newest version ‚Äú which I did because I wanted to review the recipe. Once it was downloaded I opened the App and found no saved recipes. I lost all of them. This new App is not user friendly. I most likely will just google recipes if I can‚Äôt get this App to work.
1109,1109,5,2020-07-31T10:11:29.000Z,N3X7,Love this app!,This is my go-to for most all recipes I use. One of the most creative ways to use it is what I‚Äôd call ‚Äúreverse recipe engineering‚Äù. Essentially I find a local seasonal key ingredient at the farmers‚Äô market and then search Yummly for a way to use it to create a dish I‚Äôve never before made.

I‚Äôve tried to reach the source of this to get information in there was zero help. Do not get yourself locked into this program
1130,1130,5,2017-09-19T00:08:18.000Z,ShanikaSandy,#1 goto,Simply awesome. There's always more than one option to choose from. You change the servings from 4 to 1 or how many your serving .

1144,1144,5,2020-10-30T20:22:52.000Z,howie63,Great app!,I do not bother looking for recipes anywhere else. There are so many recipe options & I love that I can organize my favorite recipes. Lately I‚Äôve been looking for keto recipes for my husband who has diabetes. This app makes my life so much easier. Thank You Yummly!!!üåàü•∞
1145,1145,5,2020-02-02T18:35:07.000Z,shar6235,Love Yummly,"I really love your app. I can find any recipe I want and more! Thanks Yummly. The only thing I wish was that when I find a recipe elsewhere that I could save it in Yummly. Or some of my grandmas recipes, I wish I could put in Yummly so I‚Äôm not searching through my books for them!"
1146,1146,4,2020-06-02T00:24:35.000Z,Zanzabar*,Best search options,The search options are so customizable. It‚Äôs fantastic. The one thing I would like changes is how recipes are filed. It is difficult to organize your recipes because you have to tap or hold down the ‚ÄúYum‚Äù button. It‚Äôs easy to accidentally ‚Äúunsave‚Äù something.
1147,1147,4,2020-05-20T02:16:55.000Z,ry4n0H,A ton of recipes!,"Lots of recipes on here but somethings it‚Äôs a little hard to find the one you want to use. If you are thinking something easy they have a filter for that. However, if you are ok with taking on something a little more advanced those can be tough to find."
1148,1148,5,2019-11-23T18:44:21.000Z,Dyuanna,I LIVE BY THIS APP!!,"I have collected a digital recipe book that is only possible due to this great App!  I don‚Äôt know what I would do without it!!! I‚Äôve been using it for a few years now. And will continue to do so. I recommended it to all my friends, and a few strangers too."
1149,1149,5,2019-11-20T03:51:36.000Z,MarquisChavonne,Love this app!,Everything about this app is dope. It has recipes that range from retaurant quality to beginner home cook stuff that i can do with my daughter. All the recipes are easy to follow and the app is easy to navigate. I browse daily and cook recipes from here often. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
1150,1150,4,2018-10-06T04:46:00.000Z,"Jump,l",Good but could use improvement,Shows recipes that contains ingredients that are common and has wide array of recipes. Also allows you to sort recipes based on likes and dislikes. However some recipes are posted multiple times and there is no way to sort by popularity or rating
1151,1151,5,2018-12-17T18:20:51.000Z,Kdarlin87,Best recipe app,This app is amazing! It‚Äôs my go-to almost daily! A great place to find new recipes or ideas and it‚Äôs also awesome if you have any dietary needs like allergies or special diets.

1153,1153,5,2019-02-20T15:19:52.000Z,Jianne,So helpful,Sometimes I feel like the recipes are limited - I would love to be able to add recipes from other sources. But the best part is the electronic shopping list and the ability to add items directly from a recipe to the list. It‚Äôs been great.
1154,1154,5,2019-03-10T20:38:23.000Z,MMM55,I‚Äôve Actually Started Cooking!,The weekly emails are great! I always find at least 2 new things to cook for the next week! I love that you can filter out ingredients because I have a very picky eater at home. Since I started using Yummly I have cut our eating out in half!
1155,1155,4,2019-03-24T11:04:15.000Z,Gogo315,My go to recipe finder,"I‚Äôve used several recipe apps but always find myself coming back to Yummly so I just deleted the other apps from my phone. I like that you can choose ingredients that you don‚Äôt like or are allergic to, although this doesn‚Äôt always work, thus the 4 stars instead of 5."
1156,1156,5,2019-04-27T18:14:33.000Z,Preetusenor,An awesome app,Yummly is one of the versatile apps for recipes when you are blanked out on any day.

1159,1159,4,2019-08-03T17:26:47.000Z,Randoperson,Google for recipes!,"I still like this app,  still think its the best for me, I just wish I could filter recipes by number of yumly likes. Some have 30, some have 20K. But there‚Äôs no method, and I end up scrolling through thousands of recipes of rosemary potatoes. Sometimes its a lot to filter and shot in the dark if the recipe is good"
1160,1160,1,2018-01-04T13:12:15.000Z,Lalalate,App not worth the trouble,"It has dietary preferences but to ‚Äúexplore‚Äù I had to adjust my ‚Äútastes‚Äù to get any results. I did try to adjust and no buttons would change. I have two issues. First, I shouldn‚Äôt have to compromise my preferences and second, if I do compromise, it should work."

1163,1163,5,2018-09-25T11:42:32.000Z,Jmcra,Very helpful app,Can find any recipe for anything on this app. which is fantastic. Only problem is a lot of the recipes aren‚Äôt rated by users so I have encountered a few duds. All of us users need to rate the things we try to make this app even better!
1164,1164,5,2020-12-19T21:53:51.000Z,Debfaight,The best recipe keeper & organizer!,Couldn‚Äôt be any easier to save a recipe seen online & organize to a category!  Only wish you could somehow add a note as I sometimes do something a little different or like to remember what I served it with - everyone who‚Äôs cooks will love Yummly!
1165,1165,4,2020-12-24T03:41:24.000Z,Jojopatti,App stalls frequently,"I‚Äôm tired of trying to read a recipe, only to have it pre-empted by an ad, a video, or whatever. It‚Äôs frustrating & if I have to retry to view the recipe more than a few times it isn‚Äôt worth it."
1166,1166,5,2020-11-06T16:38:41.000Z,KMG-26,Very helpful!,"I enjoy the recipes, and often share them with others. My only suggestion is to provide the instructions below the recipe without having to go to another website."
1167,1167,1,2020-12-17T16:12:17.000Z,Itinerant Indigo,Hasn‚Äôt ever opened.,"I have downloaded and deleted this app about 20 times. The link has never worked and the website is so overloaded with ads that getting to the recipe is almost impossible. All The Recipes is easier to navigate, doesn‚Äôt bombard you with advertisements and is much more user friendly. You actually tap the recipe you want and get instructions to make the dish. I would try the All The Recipes app before trying this one."
1168,1168,5,2020-10-07T19:49:58.000Z,Whats Cookin?,Best App I Have!,I rely on the Yummly app every day.

I highly recommend this app

1170,1170,5,2020-09-30T21:38:31.000Z,SouthSoonerChic,Life saver,When you‚Äôre tired of making the same old thing this app is great. You can search for recipes with whatever you have on hand. It‚Äôs made my life way easier about looking up recipes.

Would have deleted and reinstalled but the app said I would lose my data. No problem opening from the App Store, but shouldn‚Äôt have to do it that way. Otherwise, some really great recipes here. Just wish it didn‚Äôt freeze."

Highly recommend!
1175,1175,4,2020-05-17T16:29:17.000Z,Holy wannabe,Good but could be better,I find it annoying that the whole recipes are not written out simply instead of logging on to confusingly busy blogs. I mean if one wants more details they should go to the blog but it is so annoying to have to endlessly scroll then fight ads and videos popping up.
1176,1176,5,2020-04-23T13:53:40.000Z,1949dave,Really helpful App!,"I love using Yum!  I list the ingredients I want to use, what I don‚Äôt want to use, and the recipes appear for me to choose from.

My issue is whenever I click the link for a recipe, it opens the app to a completely unrelated page. Then I have to do a search for the recipe by name. Why include a link if it doesn‚Äôt take you to the particular recipe? If not for this, I would probably give 4.5 - 5 stars."

I am still learning to use the app, but I have found it very useful."

I‚Äôm the worst cook and this app provided an overall FREE means of looking of recipes and methods in which to cook these meals. Not only that, there were videos in case you really struggled. Now this platform has become very greedy and charges you a subscription to utilize these tools. This is sad and I‚Äôm lead to believe this app will quickly lose their rank as the best recipe/cooking app very quickly."

I don‚Äôt always use it couple times a month when looking for something new and different. Went to use it today and some of the recipes tell me I have to upgrade to pro for monthly fee now. Forget that I‚Äôll just google recipes instead. ITS FREE TO GOOGLE AND get the SAME RECIPES come. So I won‚Äôt be using this app anymore. Stupid idea to charge money.

I meal plan two weeks at a time and the grocery list is amazing for doing that. I took off one star because I hate how it has to load a webpage to get the instructions for the recipe. I wish it was prebuilt into the app.

I‚Äôve tried other apps but they were not intuitively laid out and were cumbersome to use. I LOVE the save function for categories and that I can search by ingredients I have on hand. Thanks Yummly!!
1466,1466,1,2019-04-30T16:29:12.000Z,Frodsnol,Too many ads snuck into the ‚ÄúDirections‚Äù!,"I would give this app a five star review, if it weren‚Äôt for the ads that are now stuck into the directions for the recipes. I love the recipes and I‚Äôve had this out for about a year. But lately, there are way too many ads stuck into the directions which makes it difficult to sift through the directions to make the recipe. I would not recommend this app anymore."

1469,1469,4,2019-07-19T01:55:24.000Z,gewashburn,Excellent selection of recipes but printing out recipes is problematic.,"Have found the winners here. Been trying to cook from an iPhone with Missy fingers while preparing the food means you should be able to print out the recipe, and just the recipe ‚Äì not all the pretty pictures too."

I'm still discovering all that Yummly can do -- and may never plum it's depths -- but I know with the attention you pay to detail, you are able to serve a huge spectrum of people. Bravo to you!

1472,1472,3,2018-05-26T15:03:28.000Z,CarLostForever,Poor transition from email,"I get Yummly recipe recommendations in my email. When I click on one I‚Äôm interested in and am offered the option to it in the app, my expectation is that the app will link to that recipe. Instead, I am simply taken to the regular splash screen. I then have to search for the desired recipe within the app. Frustrating."
1473,1473,5,2018-05-28T21:27:08.000Z,Shirlking,My Go to Recipe App,"This app never fails me when I am looking for a particular recipe. I am also enjoying the added feature of saving the recipes that I like, making them readily available for future use."
1474,1474,4,2018-06-30T06:49:22.000Z,MissxRiRi,Easy and informational,Has lots of options where you can choose dietary restrictions or preferences.

1477,1477,3,2018-08-06T23:27:04.000Z,Couponloser,Just give me the recipe,Yummly has excellent customer support and a nice variety of recipes. But when you click on a recipe you get routed to a blog and have to scroll through lots of ads and commentary and story and blah blah blah. I just want the recipe! Tasty app is better bc of this. No blogs or pages and pages to scroll through until finally you get the directions for the recipe.
1478,1478,5,2021-05-23T18:35:29.000Z,supermomoftheyear,The perfect cooking app!,I love being able to use filters to search the recipes for specific ingredients and types of recipes! The reviews from other people about the recipes are helpful.

1482,1482,5,2020-12-11T05:00:45.000Z,Pegyueng,Kinda like Pinterest for recipe,"Very helpful on the phone, I can save random recipes that I see online on this app. Very easy to use, the recipes that come out from searching on the APP itself are also gold"
1483,1483,3,2020-12-21T17:39:18.000Z,Sliknikolai,"Lots of great features, important one missing",The app is great but missing some important features of the website. Chief among them is the pantry feature. Yes you can search for recipes by ingredient but you cannot find recipes based on everything you have on hand. For me that is a very important feature.

Then it calculated what recipes to serve me in the ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù section‚Ä¶ and they were majority gluten-filled recipes. I double checked my dietary preference settings, and sure enough, they had me down as no gluten and wheat. Do not use this app if you have any restrictions because they will be ignored, and you‚Äôll pay for the pleasure."

The link takes you straight to the app, but, not to an article. Frustrating!! Plus, it is constantly popping up windows asking about preferences, etc. Just show me the recipes! Let me search for articles! Now I‚Äôm stuck with this app for a year after my trial automatically switched to a subscription. Argh!"

It‚Äôs annoying because I‚Äôd like to be able to use the shopping list feature with them and there isn‚Äôt even an option to manually input the recipes if I don‚Äôt want to wait for them to be added. Also, some recipes that I want to un-‚Äúyum‚Äù won‚Äôt go away no matter how many times I try."

Grocery visits are so exciting these days and my husband is so thankful for the smorgasbord of tasty meals. So happy I stumbled across this amazing app!"
1776,1776,5,2018-12-12T01:36:40.000Z,jiana--,GREAT!!,"I love this app so much because it is so easy to use. It‚Äôs is not confusing at all! It personalizes your feed so well! It lets you choose beginner or advanced. You can pick a time limit, dietary restrictions and preferred flavor! It‚Äôs amazing and simple!!"

1780,1780,2,2018-02-04T15:26:49.000Z,_AmosD,Too annoying,"If developers are going to insist upon delivering ads, at least make them easy to dismiss. Trying to press a super-tiny x in just the right spot makes the Annoying Factor too great when combined with other minor annoyances (extra tap to get to recipe directions, just the right swipe to get recipe instead of enlarged photo). I'll be sticking with Epicurious, I think."
1781,1781,5,2018-05-12T22:59:18.000Z,Burbongoth,Great app although it‚Äôs add too many ordering things,I liked it better when it was recipes... go back to recipes. Add some hard to find recipes and put a search under regional foods
1782,1782,5,2018-05-20T17:38:57.000Z,Lafreeway,Awesome Recipe App,Great web crawler for recipes of all kinds. My only complaint is sometimes it takes you to a blog site and I you have to scroll forever to get the recipes but that's not the app just blogger sites.
1783,1783,5,2018-05-23T15:25:24.000Z,trumpz tiny hands,Awesome,This app really helped me up my game. Tried a lot of new recipes and my wife really likes that I am cooking more.

I don‚Äôt know what happened recently but logging in to this app has become a nightmare. It no longer saves my Google login and when I do try to sign in the app shuts down. It‚Äôs made using the app completely frustrating."

1802,1802,5,2020-07-15T00:28:22.000Z,Tony19766,Great App,"Been using Yummly for close to four years now. Love being able to find multiple variations of recipes. Just started using Pro so not sure yet about it, but it looks promising."

1805,1805,5,2020-06-05T20:33:47.000Z,TigersEye345,Love Yummly,It‚Äôs my go-to app to find recipes for family meals and also the all too frequent last-minute dinner.
1806,1806,5,2020-04-19T17:20:02.000Z,ELee87,Very tasty and easy!,It turned out better than most restaurants. Really easy to make. I did not use two sticks of butter but instead just one. I think next time I might add a little cayenne pepper.
1807,1807,5,2020-04-02T02:39:19.000Z,Tonilynn33,Perfect!,I think this app is awesome! Perfect for people who love or even like to cook or if you jus HAVE to do it lol this makes it easier and fun to find new easy recipes and ideas! Would highly recommend!
1808,1808,4,2020-03-19T12:43:07.000Z,Mr Billo,Website slow and erratic,Opened site and tried to search for recipe and moved to another page then froze. Still use site but does get frustrating. Still give a 7-8 out of 10 stars
1809,1809,2,2020-03-26T13:11:22.000Z,usually a happy camper,If it‚Äôs not broke don‚Äôt fix it,Used to be one of my favorite apps but I‚Äôve noticed recently that it freezes and closes out while I‚Äôm trying to view a recipe. This only started when they started pushing this new ‚ÄúPro Upgrade‚Äù which you have to pay for and which I don‚Äôt need. The app went from perfect to practically useless. Very disappointing.
1810,1810,5,2020-02-27T00:17:54.000Z,New I phone rules!,Great For Foodies,There are some great ideas & recipes my family and I love to use all the time. If you like trying different  food and just want to try something new this app is for you.
1811,1811,5,2020-01-23T20:57:54.000Z,Jewelzmv,Great recipes,Anytime I need a recipe I go to Yummly. It‚Äôs so easy to search for what I want to make then go through the different recipes with pictures to help me choose. So far all recipes I have made have been keepers.
1812,1812,5,2020-01-23T00:25:30.000Z,Quintencobb,Awesome,I‚Äôve learned how to make a multitude of great tasting dishes. The only problem is that the ingredients on the tab when you open the dish doesn‚Äôt match up with the webpage posted with it as much as it should
1813,1813,5,2020-01-10T08:22:52.000Z,IlovePOP123,Menu planning- easy!,I love the way you can add recipes right to your calendar. The whole week is mapped out easily. The filters and search function are super helpful to satisfy every picky or restricted eater. Love this app!
1814,1814,5,2019-12-29T17:19:48.000Z,youarewithbob,Great for food sensitivities,Wife has a lot of food sensitivities. This app is great for putting items you cannot have. That way you don‚Äôt see recipes with those items in it.
1815,1815,5,2019-12-15T13:20:36.000Z,GODMAD,Best one I‚Äôve found so far.,It has great Recipes and an easy to use grocery list creator. Just wish it had a calorie counter with a nutritions list and a macro nutrients graph. Just some ideas for an update. Thanks for the great app.
1816,1816,5,2019-11-06T15:19:46.000Z,mrs. Sedg,Great app,"Love this site! I have never looked for a recipe that I‚Äôve not been able to locate, in addition I‚Äôve found so many ideas for items I have on hand. Can‚Äôt say enough in praise of Yummly."
1817,1817,4,2019-11-10T17:31:13.000Z,Kelly.u.83,Great!,I really enjoy this app. I use it every day to schedule meals. Meal scheduling has really reduced the cost of our groceries. This app has allowed us to explore all sorts of interesting recipes. I only wish there was a better way to search for meals based on multiple ingredients.
1818,1818,5,2019-10-04T00:49:18.000Z,Socalrica,Great resource!,Yummly is my starting place when I am looking for recipes.  Easy for me to navigate & see what my options are on an ingredient or a cuisine.  Once you have it it‚Äôs hard to live without.
1819,1819,5,2019-09-26T15:38:24.000Z,whaleington,My opinionüëç,"Outstanding, helps me out all the time . Love the different recipes as well as quality food I‚Äôm able feed my friends and family! üëç use it a lot to feed me and my wifeüòÄüëå‚òùÔ∏è"
1820,1820,5,2019-03-23T14:20:50.000Z,ZoranaNH,Best recipe app,"I think this is currently the best recipe app. Once upon a time there was a better one, with more filtering/quality control - Punchfork - but it got bought out. Yummly works, has a good search, display is clean and uncluttered."
1821,1821,4,2019-03-24T18:32:14.000Z,Duckfanalex,Well done app,"Very well done. My only negative feedback is that the pattern recognition might be TOO good, meaning I like variety in my diet and I really have to search for new things because the app wants to show me recipes very similar to those I‚Äôve already made"
1822,1822,5,2019-04-12T18:27:20.000Z,onetomw,Cooking with Yum,When I need something quick I can find it. When I need something special I can find it. When I have ingredients that I want to include in a recipe I can find it whenever I get the edge to cook I can cook.
1823,1823,3,2019-04-23T22:34:57.000Z,21lakocy,Good app but could use more,I really like all the recipes and the shopping list feature. But other apps have a pantry logger so that the app knows which ingredients are in your fridge or cabinet. It would be cool if this app had that feature and would generate recipes based on the ingredients you had available.
1824,1824,5,2019-05-27T16:56:34.000Z,lsb218,I LOVE YUMMLY! Great recipes!,I like being able to choose what type of food group you would like recipes for (vegan) so it narrows down a huge search for what you‚Äôre looking for! It‚Äôs all right there! Easy breezy!

1826,1826,4,2019-08-31T21:49:04.000Z,The Lamberts,My go to meal app,Love this app especially when I'm looking for ideas for the next last minute meal. I like that it usually has multiple varieties of the same dish and I often pick and choose the ingredients that I like from 2 or more recipes.
1827,1827,5,2019-08-17T21:16:24.000Z,BrownsGalore,Nice app,Love being able to search recipes according to the ingredients I have and finding so many dishes I never would have considered making until I saw the yummy (ly ;) picture and got curious. Thanks

1836,1836,1,2018-12-05T21:58:56.000Z,Brc2765,I really wanna love you,But it‚Äôs so hard.... right now I am trying to use it on an iPad and your app does not even rotate for me! This is just showing me that you are a very small company and perhaps I should go elsewhere to save my recipes. I am also trying to save a name of a list and I‚Äôm on able to do that. It is not user intuitive. Updated: shared links still don‚Äôt work. Sigh please I‚Äôm trying to LOVE you and I‚Äôm a nutritionist sharing with clients!
1837,1837,5,2018-12-17T23:57:58.000Z,sirmeatloaf,Loafy,Best app ever my son has numerous food allergies and is difficult for me to find things with flavor he can. Being able to select the foods to stay away from has opened up worlds of food for my kiddo!

1840,1840,3,2017-11-11T16:41:13.000Z,Violet Banks,Love it except for a few things,Great app--use it all the time. The three things that frustrate me to some degree are that I cannot always listen to iTunes while following directions in the app and there are a lot of duplicate recipes. Wish all the photos were taken by the recipe provider and not stock photos.
1841,1841,3,2017-11-27T04:00:42.000Z,DentDave,Too many ads,"Would love this app except there are too many ad interruptions. Especially when beginning a recipe in the kitchen, I‚Äôm trying to read the instructions but I have to scroll through so many ads it becomes too annoying and not worth it."

2251,2251,1,2020-06-29T22:07:10.000Z,m89aria,Control freaks,Yummly is another innocent acting app that makes its living off controlling other peoples content. Other people submit recipes and Yummly almost forces you to download their app to access the recipes. You get inundated with junk and scrolling through nonsense on an endless journey to try and find theactual recipe until you just give in. I find it distasteful not yummly at all.  Bad unethical business as well.

Received links from other Yummly users (via text) opens Yummly website containing link promising to open in app. But app opens with no clue on default home page. Hard to scroll and imbedded recipes from other sources maintain nested advertisers and disruptive videos.  Useless.
2609,2609,3,2019-08-14T23:11:36.000Z,Robyn SA,Pasta with Clam Sauce,"The flavors are very light but adding extra red pepper flakes is an easy fix.  However, I made the recipe exactly as written and I won‚Äôt make it again using the bucatini...it is just too heavy and gummy for such a light sauce.  Linguine or even angel hair or regular spaghetti would enhance the flavor and not overpower the dish.  I will save the bucatini for a bolognese or heavy marinara sauce!"

The dock and the app on my phone disconnects even though it‚Äôs with in 2 feet of the dock which is less than a foot from the grill.

Not clear how to delete ingredients I don‚Äôt want so I ended up getting tons of recipes irrelevant to my diet. I don‚Äôt have time to explore how to delete preferences‚Äîit should be as simple as having an x on the ingredient. I have better things to do than scroll for 10 minutes to find one new recipe.

I selected a photo because it looked amazingly delicious and then spent the next 15 minutes scrolling to find it.  NEVERY FOUND IT!  I gave up looking.  So the site is definitely not helpful at all.  It has tickled my taste buds but left me standing out here drooling with no recipe in sight.  That stinks!

3468,3468,1,2018-10-09T04:56:51.000Z,johanballin,Infinity loop,Seems like a nice app but the iOS app never gets beyond ‚Äúcheck your email‚Äù. All I can do is click on ‚Äúresend confirmation email‚Äù. Upon receiving the email I click on the appropriate link which then sends me right back to ‚Äúcheck your email‚Äù. It works fine in a web browser as well as on AppleTV so there‚Äôs no fatfingering on my side.  Buggy!!

3503,3503,3,2020-07-18T19:46:50.000Z,1946Frito,Disappointed in chefs,I do not like the labels some chefs put on their recipes.  Example: Mexican trash and recipes labeled crack. I do not make these recipes and thinking about uninstalling this app. I have had this app a long time. You could do better.
3504,3504,4,2020-06-28T16:36:06.000Z,Jackclaymom,Beautiful app,I really like this app but if you want the directions to something you have to go out of the app which is slightly annoying.

For example, if I look at dinner recipes I see mostly side dishes or desserts. There is no filter for high protein meals, so enjoy supplementing almost every rice bowl with a protein shake."

That‚Äôs not great, but people have to make money. What I cannot stand is being asked to try the premium version. Every. Single. Time. I open the app. Lame."

This app used to be the best app ever now it signs me out of my account every time I open it and if I try to sign back in it just crashes. I‚Äôm so upset with it. Please fix this. Right now I‚Äôd give it 0 stars if I could.

I only installed this since I bought the smart thermometer. I would not have bought the thermometer if I knew how bad the hard sell for paid version was. Recommend avoiding this app.
4403,4403,2,2021-02-24T22:24:11.000Z,The Other Half Cat,Used to be great,Every update they take away features and want you to pay for what used to be freee. And they sill have ads! The latest update removed the calendar sync. My library of recipes keeps disappearing too. So frustrating!

I'm a very good southern cook and that includes fixing my share of fried foods, cornbread homemade biscuits gravy every week, we were all healthy, not overweight & took no meds for any medical conditions related to diet. Once my children were grown & gone I went through the ""stop & pick something up"" stage. Within 2-3 years my husband was on BP meds, I was on cholesterol meds & had gained weight along with other medical issues. Then I stumbled upon this App & I couldn't believe all the great recipes!! How good they looked & how easy they were to keep track of & how fixing them didn't feel like a chore!! I was not only enjoying cooking again but I was coming up with reasons to cook. Yes I'm still cooking southern food of course but also things I'd never made or even heard of before!! I didn't cook us a special meals for our medical issues or our weight gain but it didn't take long for the weight to come off & for the RXs to be discontinued. I believe it's because we were eating less preservatives & junks food. Yes I still fry, I make cobblers & bake all those wonderful southern dishes, cakes & pies. It's probably easier to say I cook whatever looks good. I keep a lot of folders. You'll figure out what works for you but I have 2-3 special folders I'd suggest. One for quick meals (some of those even go in the crockpot frozen). A ""favorites"" folder and a ""don't make again"" folder for the few we didn't like. Definitely give it a try. I really believe even if your kids are still home, cooking will not feel like a chore that you just dread. But you'll enjoy it again & hopefully will get your kids in there with you helping. I love when my grandchildren are here & ask to help me!! I just absolutely LOVE this App..!!! I wrote this review 2-3 years ago and I just wanted to say that I STILL love this app and I still love cooking!! I suggested that you use folders and still believe that‚Äôs the best way to go. I have several Favs, Crockpot Meats, Crockpot Meals, Holidays, Grilling, Tailgating etc. As my grandchildren got older and started cooking more, I made one for them that includes complete meals, sandwiches, snacks etc..."

10493,10493,4,2020-12-12T12:56:25.000Z,st4447,Updates are making the app worse not better,"This app was wonderful and probably the best thing I ever used.  However I believe they are constantlyTrying to monetize it through the smart thermometer and the subscription service. Instead of making it better so you want to pay for it, it gets worse! The search feature has been destroyed.  IT was previously spot-on and returned exactly what you asked for.  Now, it‚Äôs never precise and gives you random recipes.   Also you could previously save your own recipes into your account but axed that feature too.   The latest update was that they had added a page but you know need to go look at it before you go to the main page. I do not mind paying money for a good product but please make it better and not worse for the user. Now, I am also worried that my recipes will start getting deleted with new updates so I plan to move away from Yummly.  Think about this Yummly.  Here are a few features that a user like me would gladly pay additional money for:"

11840,11840,5,2013-12-03T06:38:30.000Z,Brandons888,Favorite Recipe App... Couple improvements would make it PERFECT!,"This app is great. Looks wonderful. You can add food directly to the shopping list... And it  automatically categorizes the foods so you're not walking all over the store! Recently the feature was added to sort recipes in to different categories (dinner, sides, breakfast, etc) with option to make your own! If 2 more features were added this app would be PERFECT!"
11841,11841,3,2014-05-19T15:02:56.000Z,Dukeydukes,"Good idea, needs better execution","I love the idea of this app, however it is such a pain to work through."
11842,11842,4,2015-04-04T12:56:57.000Z,Strictly Rootz,"Great app, with too many kinks.","4/4/15 Love this app, but it is dreadfully, painstakingly slow on my iPhone. All of the hangups I've experienced with this app have been on my phone only.  It locks up, skips, and if I use it around 10/15 minutes, it shuts down. So annoying. I have to use this app on my computer or tablet for fluid usage."
11843,11843,4,2015-05-18T05:49:29.000Z,pagepack,"Fantastic app, missing just one thing",I love this app! I was all excited to see the beautiful pics (I'm very visual) and it is so user friendly and easy to navigate. It quickly learns what foods you do and don't like and makes searching recipes a breeze. The list maker is super easy and how cool that it syncs across devices?!
11844,11844,3,2015-12-31T04:38:48.000Z,There'sAFrogInMyTent,Glitches should have been fixed by now but aren't,"This seems to be a very popular app and for good reason: it's beautiful, sleek, and helps you enjoy cooking and eating. But as other reviewers have mentioned, there are two troubling problems. If your phone locks in the middle of cooking a recipe, the app reverts back to the home screen and you have to slowly navigate through several screens to get back to your place. Also, the favorites/Yums list does not refresh with newly added Yums until you log out (disconnect) and log back in again. In fact, this is the official advice I received when I contacted them for help. I will say their response was very fast. In fact you will notice the number of your Yums (favorites) is correct and if you happen to remember (I usually don't) the recipe name, you can get to it by searching within your Yums, but the title won't actually display in the overall list. For an app this popular and so often included in ""best of"" lists, I don't understand why they haven't fixed these glitches yet. I hope they do."
11845,11845,5,2016-02-26T14:14:49.000Z,Jenn&Frankie,Love Yummly recipes!! My son requires lactose and whey free recipes,"Thanks to apps like Yummly, I can quickly find peer reviewed yummy recipes for my son that has severe lactose intolerance which includes whey and powdered milks. He is essentially ""allergic"" to milk proteins, but can tolerate a few items. If we list milk as an allergy on his medical records he will be totally screwed for any future hospitalizations so we keep it at an intolerance so I could always cook for him at the Ronald mc Donald house and bring him food. The cafeteria isn't great about making diary free foods that are appealing to a 3 year old with eating issues that has Down Syndrome and Severe Down Syndrome.  This app is a lifesaver. Thanks.  You all rock. If anyone reads this and is in a similar boat, but is further along and could help me out. Or is just starting this journey and wants to get info like me, feel free to contact me at alienjenn at yahoo"
11846,11846,4,2016-04-07T15:01:53.000Z,Sequesther,Kinda like a Flipboard for cooks...!,This truly deserves to be an app essential. I've used it since its inception and the fact that the ui and ux nuts-n-bolts have remained more or less unchanged is proof of Yummly's staying power. I've gotten so many great recipes and been inspired to create new food memories thanks to Yummly! Love the upgrades and little tweaks that enhance the app without altering its simple elegant interface.
11847,11847,3,2016-11-03T21:30:49.000Z,brookm24,Good but want more simple & Options,"I really like this app. I didn't give more than 3 stars because, I'm a picky simple eater and I did the beginner cooking skill & added foods to dislike because the allergies section didn't let me add my food allergies and the intolerance to foods like I am slightly lactose intolerant I'm allergic to mushrooms & I don't do low fat or sodium because it really doesn't do much your body needs these things you just don't over do the salt or over eat. I would likfe the dishes that are listed for me didn't have or list what I said I can't eat have or dislike. Or if they had other ingredients listed for substituting or omitting them all together."
11848,11848,5,2017-04-13T01:11:03.000Z,SarahEv3,So personalized!,"I love Yummly. I've recommended it to classmates and family. When you get the app, it asks you about what food you like to eat, how many people you're cooking for, what foods you don't like, and your cooking level (I'm a beginner). This app makes it easy to save recipes so they're ""yum'd"" for later. It's also easy to organize them into categories such as breakfast, dinner, snacks, desserts, or your own personalized categories such as vegetarian or appetizers. This app has made me want to cook more and there are so many delicious recipes that are easy to access and retrieve when you need them. I also love how fast and easy it is to save something by clicking ""yum.""  Highly recommend this app. Please don't change. I do wish that I could save some of the videos though. I occasionally watch recipe videos and I can't always go back to find them. That's one request that I'd like to make. Good work and fantastic app!"

11850,11850,4,2013-10-20T15:11:56.000Z,Kmurph205,Love this app!,"I really like this app, and would give it 5 stars if it weren't for 2 minor, but fairly annoying things. I often search for multiple recipes at a time, so when I open the search bar I have to delete the last thing I searched for, no big deal except when you do that it sends you back to the home page and closes the search bar. Why would I delete a word in the search bar to close it? If I wanted to close it I would. Until I got used to that it resulted in me accidentally opening recipes I didn't want because I thought my keyboard was still open, and I was trying to type."
11851,11851,5,2013-11-20T14:53:54.000Z,alampros,Customer service at its best,"I had a slight issue that caused the app to crash when I attempted to login with my Google+ account. I sent a quick email to their support team and received a friendly and personal response within minutes (literally, 8 minutes). The fix was submitted to the App Store for approval and out to my phone in less than 2 days. I even got a follow-up email to let me know the fix was available."
11852,11852,4,2014-03-03T15:29:21.000Z,"A new, original nickname",Beautiful and very useful app,"This app is like pandora for recipes. They'll suggest recipes based on past recipes that you've liked and they've been quiet accurate with their suggestions. The app is also very easy to navigate and has a beautiful interface. I've found some great recipes here with easy to follow instructions, an easy shopping list feature, and even nutrition facts. I'm giving the app 4 stars because they don't always have the recipes I'm looking for. Also other more established cooking websites have the advantage of thousands of users reviews for each recipe. So they'll automatically pull up the recipe people found easiest to use and best tasting. I find great recipes on yummly but I sometimes feel safer using a recipe I've found from a more established cooking website. That's just a matter of time and numbers that the other websites bring to the table that yummly can't as of now. However in terms of an app vs a website yummly is so far my favorite."
11853,11853,5,2015-02-11T00:33:07.000Z,Cin cityH,Love it!!,"I've been using blue apron for a while because I was so busy with work, but decided to try meal planning on my own to allow more flexibility and for us to pick meals more suited to my family's dietary needs. I tried a couple different meal planning apps but they were either too limited in recipe finding or too structured and took too long to set up. I found yummly and love it!! It's UI is so intuitive and beautiful compared to other meal planning sites. Plus the recipe searching is second to none - you pick up food blogs, traditional food/recipe sites and all with very powerful filtering. Than you can create you shopping list and just buy what you need. The only feature I wish it had was a way to organize the meal plan for the week so you could put together the entrees and sides you pick, but I somewhat got around that by creating a new collection for the specific week.  Awesome app!!"
11854,11854,5,2015-07-12T18:03:01.000Z,holonomy,Best collections & variety! Great app!,I love receiving my Yummly emails as they're always filled with scrumptious recipes from appetizers to desserts. The app is very user friendly and makes it easy to see the ingredient list as well as the directions and time involved. You can easily add any items to a shopping list that you can order for delivery (I've not done that but it has that feature) or you can just readily pull up the shopping list which automatically adds the quantity of the ingredients.
11855,11855,5,2015-08-22T07:49:22.000Z,Ssssstupid,Wow,"I'm updating this review because I have even more awesome to share! First-I rarely write reviews but this app deserves it. I've finally discovered the singular app that curates all of my favorite recipes, creates shopping lists and keeps the above organized for easy reference! Ahhh! I love this app so much! Can create as many ""categories"" (think ""boards"" on Pinterest) for my recipes and most important, like Pinterest, it's a visual based app! I scroll through PHOTOS of the recipes I've added! Score! I typically visit sites like TheKitchn or Martha Stewart or pioneer woman for tried and true excellent recipes- this app lets me search all of those AND recommends like recipes. I finally have my inspiration for cooking 3 meals at home again.

First, if I enter in a recipe of my own using the web interface, I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out how to refresh my list of recipes on my iPhone.  It eventually shows up, but not in a timely manner. Second, and this is really my biggest complaint. When I go to the trouble of entering in a recipe of my own, when I add the recipe to my shopping list I expect the ingredients to appear exactly as I have entered them.  For instance, if I enter ‚Äú2 spaghetti squashes‚Äù why does it appear just as ‚Äú2 squash‚Äù in my shopping list? Or if I enter an ingredient ‚Äú2 cups no-beef broth‚Äù, why does it appear as ‚Äú2 cup beef broth‚Äù? Sometimes the details matter! Third, why does my shopping list keep rearranging itself? It‚Äôs especially irritating when I‚Äôm checking off several items and the order of the list keeps changing! Fix these three things and I‚Äôll change my rating to 5 stars!"

I lack some major creativity in the kitchen and this makes that so much easier. Very much appreciate the categorization of recipes and that they can be added to multiple categories at once. Love that the shopping list isn't just a list but you can check things off as you go- so convenient! A couple suggestions:
11858,11858,5,2017-06-05T23:50:14.000Z,buggedoutbears,Great App! Plus it's free!,"I never write apps but I had to for this because it has had such a positive impact on me! I have tried many meal planning apps and this is by far my favorite. It asks your likes/dislikes any special diet you may be paleo, etc. Then it suggests recipes or you can search.  I have a hard time finding recipes that my kiddos will eat and this app has helped so much! They are trying new things and so are we! We are also eating healthier thanks to the healthy option of recipes!It has brought us all to the family table again. Another perk is that once you find a recipe you like you add it to your ""yum"" box and you can pick the ingredients you need to make the recipes and it adds it to a grocery list! Awesome! Hope you give it a try it really has taken lots of stress outta my life with the constant wondering what I am gong to fix for the week. This makes it so easy!"
11859,11859,3,2017-09-17T16:14:04.000Z,Blacgold,Solid app,"I've already told many friends about it. Before I could form a request they added the option to search based on ingredients that I have on hand, but the effort needs improvement. Dump the pre-existing list. This actually took the app a bit backwards for me because mayonnaise began showing up as an ingredient in some of the recipes that I'd searched. Since I put that on my banned list it was surprising."

I knew some of my guests had food allergies and you can restrict your search so those ingredients don't show up. Also, I was able to add ingredients to a shopping list and then text or email it to my husband who was shopping with me."

It has allll the recipes you need because it pulls from the vastness of almost every recipe app I love PLUS the Internet etc. I love the shopping list and scanner abilities and the fact that you can even scan an item and see what you can make with it since it shows you related recipes. It's gorgeous as well - I love the formatting. My only thing is that sometimes when rapidly yumming things üòé I sometimes wish that there was a quicker way to select the type of yum that it is ie: breakfast dinner drink side etc and I wish the order stayed the same everytime you go to do that or at least have a smart feature that does that for you?? Or maybe it's just perfect the way it is! üíõüíôüíúüíö‚ù§ I literally have never left this kind of comment/review on any app before ever. Good job Yummly !!!

As an old guy that's been eating pretty much grilled everything this app brings new light to all the alternatives out there.  As I'm working to improve the 'ol diet as the metabolism isn't what it used to be this app has real appeal in that it shows you the calorie count as well as the ingredients and nutritional values.
11863,11863,4,2015-01-12T19:25:58.000Z,Kamakaze121,Good App! Easy to use,"I just started using this app and I gotta say it's pretty good. You can look up a ton of recipes ranging from quick and easy to full on pro dishes. I also like that you can search by ingredient, diet (paleo, vegan, etc,) and you can enter ingredients u don't want or are allergic to into your profile. You can also make sub categories and put recipes into categories such as sides, dessert or make your own and separate your chicken, beef, and fish dishes. The best thing about the app is that you can tap on the ingredient and add it to your shopping list to have handy next time you go to he grocery store. It also links up to your health app on the new iPhone 6 and tracks your intake. Good app overall.... Didn't give it 5 stars because there is always room for improvement... Although I haven't found a flaw yet. Do recommend!!!!!"

I love the emphasis on the pics - i.e. scrolling through pics to choose the recipe you'd like.  I love the shopping list, which I just used for the first time this weekend.  It is very easy to use.  I saw a comment once where someone thought it was difficult to go through your ""yums"" once you have a large amount, but that is easily manageable if you just categorize things as you ""yum"" them - ex. label something as dinner, lunch, drink, etc.  They also let you create your own labels which is nice.  I've created a label called ""this week"".  I put all of my meals for the week in that category so it's easy to add them to the shopping list and also easy to find them once you are ready to cook them!   Love this app!!"
11865,11865,5,2015-03-28T00:54:05.000Z,Missyleighh,Great app for those who love to cook,"This app is really fantastic. As a young person who is just beginning to enjoy the love of cooking, I use this a lot. I am constantly using this all to find new recipes. Or if I pick something up at the store that is on sale, I immediately use this app to find a recipe to use it in. Also, as a vegetarian it is great for finding recipes that contain items that contain item necessary for a vegetarian diet such as eggs, beans, etc. I usually get bored with food quickly so I use this app to try 1 or 2 new recipes a week. I also enjoy the ""pantry"" feature which tells me exactly what to shop for when shopping for new recipes to try. In general, this app is fun, easy to navigate, great for nutritionalists, or those who are just looking for an easier way to cook. Definitely get this if you like to cook."
11866,11866,5,2015-04-25T15:51:56.000Z,Dutchess of Gyor,"Time, Space & Money-saving","Yummly is my very own, ever-expanding, lightweight, recipe 'book' that I carry everywhere to explore & create healthy family meals at a moment's notice!  I now have an entire pantry shelf available for food/storage items instead of a massive, 55-year, international collection of cooking & recipe books (I've donated them all to Christian school-charity garage sales, Goodwill & Salvation Army).  The Search Feature for a broad range of recipes that contain the item(s) you already have in the fridge is The Best Feature of Yummly (besides the fact that it's a Free app); followed closely by the Shopping List Feature that saves time in quickly checking off the items you need, against what you already have at home; and, helps you keep focus off of costly 'snack-attack' extras strategically placed in the store.  In short, Yummly is a Great Blessing to me."
11867,11867,4,2016-12-27T19:39:55.000Z,terrible123456,Love it but could use some improvements,"I love the app and I use it weekly! It helps me try new things and it helps me stay on top of what I'm actually intaking. I love how you find new recipes but I'm finding some recipes' ingredient lists are not the same as they are once you click 'get directions.' Also the interface of using the app to then have to go to a blog to get the full recipe is troubling. Often there will be ads or a lot of stuff crowding up the page and making it hard to read on a phone. There should be a feature added to the grocery list that acts as a ""preparing this week"" type list so you can compile both the ingredients you need and which recipes you're using that week to make it easier on you once you go back to the app to make the dish. Overall, love it but it can be tweaked."
11868,11868,5,2017-07-26T12:55:37.000Z,Sashi621,My Favorite App!,"Even if cooking is not your forte, this app will draw you in with its simplicity and beautiful pictures. In the beginning you'll set up your own personal profile and let Yummly know if you have certain food allergies, what foods you like, what foods you don't like. They also have all the categories..,.Mexican, Japanese, Mediterranean, vegan, it's all there. You can also choose your recipes depending on how difficult they are to make. If needed, you can choose recipes which are more simple to make, or try intermediate or more difficult recipes for a challenge. I love that you can add all the items to a shopping list, too. I had a a couple of issues with my account (which were totally my fault!) and their customer service was so nice and quickly fixed my problem!"

So I send support some feedback thinking maybe if enough people suggested it they might change things in the future. Turns out I'm just an idiot. They emailed me back the same day and told me where the filters were, right under the search function. I says to myself, ""well that's nice, but I'll bet you don't have one for slow cookers, or prep time..."" Open up the app and check it out, shazam; filter by fat, cholesterol, calories, cooking methods, prep time, carbs, salt, bitterness, sweetness, meal course, what tv show it pairs with, you get the idea. They've thought of it all. Just quit reading this and get the app already. It's good."

Something that is clean and immediate is a great find. App is great so far. UI is good, architecture seems well thought out and overall design is approachable. Love the ability to simply add ingredients to your shopping lists from a selected recipe so please look at the process of leveraging those lists off the websites/blogs/posts you get option recipes from because I'm coming across a lot of broken or missing items on the lists. That part is a little cumbersome as you have to go back and forth to double check to make sure you got everything on your shopping list to create the meal."

Since getting the Yummly app never have I been more excited and and willing to get in my kitchen and start stirrin' up the goods.  There is something for every palate on Yummly and as an added bonus, my kids love to go through the various recipes and ""yum"" the meals, snacks and desserts that are most appealing to them.  That's a huge plus for me because I don't have to guess about what they do or don't like, I can simply look at their selections.  My husband uses it for grilling ideas and useful tips.  So in one app I've gotten over my fear and resentment of cooking and have replaced it with with the joy of togetherness in creating a great, nutritious meal with my family."

I have recently game to a grain free sugar free dairy free diet and it has not been easy to say the least to find things to eat, so I appreciate the amount of recipes I am able to find on the Yummly but and this is a big but Since the update it consistently crashes it's very frustrating to be in the middle of making a recipe and having the app crash. I have to re-open the app and find the meal that I was in the middle of cooking and scroll past the bloggers commentaries to find where I was most of the time this involves washing my hands before and after I use the phone again it's a sad sad day üò≠üò≠"

I just wish that I could select multiple ingredients that I don't use at one time. For example, I don't use sugar, when I type in sugar a very long list of different sugars appears. Unfortunately I can only pick one sugar at a time. Then I have to repeat the search to select the next type of sugar I don't use and on and on and on. Brown sugar, light brown sugar, caster sugar, maple sugar, cane sugar, dark brown sugar, beet sugar, confectioners sugar, super fine sugar, raw sugar... And you can't just select multiple sugars in one go. So that bit is time consuming, but once that's done the recipes are spot on as to what I am looking for."

I've found that I love to make Greek dishes and there's no shortage of delightful Greek recipes for anything that I want to cook. It also gives nutrition information, an option to add items needed to your grocery list, and a whole bunch of other options that are super useful. It makes creating a gourmet meal as easy as making a family friendly, easy weeknight meal. I highly recommend this app to anyone who loves to cook classic favorites as well as new things!"

I use this to meal plan for at least 4-5 days out of the week and I LOVE that it's syncs to my calendar and tells me when to get started.

I use it all the time when I'm looking for new recipes and love it's convenience.

I love the fact that I can search recipes based on nutrition guidelines I apply and also change in regards to what I want to make. I added a category to my Yumms that is ""Today's Dish"" so I can quickly find the recipe, add items I need to get to the Shopping List, and finally make. The shopping list is crucial for me personally. I'm the kind of person that walks into a grocery store with a few thugs in mind (not written down) and walk out with almost everything except those items. All I can say a negativity is sometimes I wish I could have this app on my Kindle Fire. Absolutely amazing and beautiful app."

I wanted to diversify my cooking, especially since I'm newly married, but I needed it to work with my schedule. I went to the App Store and I ran across Yum ü§ó. Not only do they give you easy step by step directions, but you can also click on the ingredients and know exactly what to shop for. Now I try a different meal at least 2x a week. My first meal didn't come out correctly, but once I kept trying it got better. Had this app for about 3 weeks now and I tell other ppl about it. Great for versatility and beginners like myself.

But it is less expensive than going out to eat every night, plus I have a family of four to feed.  I hate the planning part even worse than the cooking part, but Yummly has made that easier for me.  I love getting email notifications with suggestions for meals, it gives me great ideas that are customized for our taste in food.   I love that you don't even have to leave your house for the ingredients.  In my area, we have the ability to shop the grocery list that is automatically generated based on the recipes you choose, and it is delivered right to your door!

One thing I wanted to do in the new year was try new and unique cuisines. This is perfect for that. However, my rating has went from a 4 to a 3 not only because they don't have some sort of button where you can make the recipes you don't like or don't want to see disappear. It's annoying to see soo many smoothies when I didn't select that as one of the things I was really into. Plus they really are not taking into account the foods that I specifically said I disliked. They show sooooo many vegan recipes and guess what I'm far far far from vegan or vegetarian. I do hope this is fixed because I'm sure I miss out on a lot of the recipes I would cook because I'm seeing so many useless unwanted recipes!"

I'm able to tailor the recipes so that only vegan recipes are shown and I am astonished at all the possibilities available to me through this wonderful app! I would highly recommend this to anyone with dietary needs that still wants a large variety of food options. Another great thing is the nutritional facts shown on every recipe, and the ability to categorize your favorites. Also, the shopping cart feature is incredibly useful, and i can say it has saved me both time and money on my grocery shopping. I use this nearly every day!"

One thing I would like to see added is the ability to mark when you have tried a recipe. I save many recipes to my ""yums"". I would like to be able to distinguish the ones I have tried from the ones I haven't tried and organize them as such. And maybe give them my own ranking(not something that would be published to others, just something so I could know how my family liked them. Also the ability to add notes would be great. (something like , ""added a little more garlic"". Or ""substituted this ingredient"".) It would be great to have the ability to do that. But overall a great app!!"

I love the recipes section and especially how I'm able to tailor my search with nutrition filters and dietary preferences. Went grocery shopping for the first time with the list feature yesterday. The only downsides are that I'm unable to create my own shopping categories, edit the category after I've added an item, sometimes it won't let me add an item if it's not on their pop up list of items, there's no ability to add multiple lists, and there's no function to add prices to each item to estimate the total cost. If these were fixed or added, I would give five stars."

I cook for 4 kids on a budget and this app allows me to mix it up every week and the best part of this app is if you allow it to know your location it can show you which ingredients are on sale at your nearest grocery store from the recipe you are using.

I have almost minimum food waste now due to this app. Great for meal planning. Two problems though. The listed ingredients and measurements are not always the same as the ones on the actual recipe site and some really strange numbers or items pop up. Second and most important--a very fickle shopping list that syncs when it feels like it. I use my iPad at home to browse and plan meals on Yummly. When I whip out my iPhone for the shopping list at the grocery store, I have to cross my fingers that it synced and I'm not left browsing through all the recipes I plan to cook that week and adding them back on my shopping list.

The best thing about this app that is you can adjust the settings to filter out what you like and don't like or other food preferences. That makes looking for a recipe with something you want to use SO much easier because it'll only show you what's relevant to you. You can also pick your cooking level.

This app is simply magnificent. If I were famous, I'd have to be the face of its advertisement. Simply put...this app is dope...and at intergalactic potency!!! üòä"
11897,11897,5,2017-02-09T15:28:25.000Z,DianaR87,My favorite app!,"Yummly has to be my favorite app on my phone. It's probably the one I use the most. As a person who is now gluten free, it is so essential that this app allowed me to set my preferences and needs for my account based on food allergies, etc. All of the recommended recipes for me are gluten free every time I access my app. I don't have to filter the recipes each time I log in, which is extremely convenient. It's also great how I can categorize my recipes that I've ""Yummed"" by breakfast, lunch, etc. I don't have to search the internet for good recipes anymore. Yummly is my go-to recipe box for sure! Love, love, love it! Oh and it's free! üòÉ"
11898,11898,5,2017-03-17T07:53:42.000Z,Vermont hamster,Love it!,"I am so happy to have found this app! I feel like it literally saves my life. I had been spending so much of my time clueless about cooking and agonizing about what to feed myself, so frustrated that this dilemma never ends, and then just giving up and ordering takeout, which had such a negative effect on my body and my wallet. And then came Yummly. It is amazing. I'm actually doing a cleanse right now with pretty specific exclusions. Yummly makes it so easy to set your criteria and then find tons of recipes that will fit. I am so grateful. And my hope is that the bank of recipes will just keep expanding. This is genius. Please don't ever take this away!"
11899,11899,5,2017-04-26T19:34:10.000Z,Fivesistersranch,A few of my favorite things...,I love that Yummly gives a preview to the ingredients without having to open another page. I love that you can build a menu by adding recipes to your Yum folder and create sub folders (I keep a weekly menu folder that I can easily move recipients in and out of without deleting them). I love that you can click and add ingredients to create a shopping list and share with others (I forward mine to my husband so he can shop on his way home). It is also great that you can share recipes directly with friends through text or email. Keep up the good work Yummly!
11900,11900,4,2014-07-31T12:43:59.000Z,La Cocina Ella,Great App! Some thoughts...,"I waited a while to review the app so I could see all the features. I LOVE the design and layout, the ability to create a shopping list and categorize recipes. This app has really inspired me to cook. Improvements to be made: the list of ingredients doesn't always match the actual recipe, so I spent a little extra money on that glitch. The directions section just takes you to the website of the blogger, which is fine but it never loads so I always go straight to my computer when it's time to cook. If the recipe feed refreshed a bit more with new ideas as well I would have zero complaints. Will continue to use!!!"
11901,11901,4,2015-02-18T03:46:10.000Z,Jimie&me,The best so far,"Every time I want a new twist on an old favorite , or something brand newI have found that the other cooking apps either assume I am a rank amateur or a professional chef. Neither is true. Yummly gives me plenty of options by meal, course, or ingredients. In less time than it takes me to gather my utensils, I have located just what I was searching for."
11902,11902,5,2015-04-13T23:53:23.000Z,Mkematt,Currently my favorite recipe app,"There are lots of recipe apps. And I keep trying new ones, looking for the perfect one. But currently this one has been very reliable for me.  My only gripe would be that it doesn't ingest the recipes into a common format, instead it requires you often times to follow a link to the original website. This means that some recipes aren't actually ""in the app"" which just means the formatting, and page layout can be difficult on smaller screens."
11903,11903,4,2015-05-12T15:54:05.000Z,WickedGoodCookahYall,NEEDS 1 OPTION TO GET 5 STARS,"I recently downloaded this app & so far I LOVE IT!!  The one thing I thought would be great was the likes/dislikes at the beginning to ""explore"" recipes. Unfortunately, it doesn't allow you to get specific. For example: Seafood & Fish categories. I ABHOR oysters, clams, mussels, anchovies, sardines, smelts, & mackerel. But, I LOVE shrimp, scallops, lobster, salmon, swordfish, flounder & haddock. You get the idea. Currently, this app only lets you select a type of food with an all or nothing approach. If this were changed to a dropdown screen, so that when you tap on a category such as seafood (or fish) you could eliminate foods you hate from being suggested, I would definitely give it 5 stars!!!"
11904,11904,4,2016-02-17T05:45:50.000Z,The Neiko Company,Love it! Just please get rid of...,"Great app for recipes! Easy to navigate and save favorite recipes and categorize them at the same time. However, when clicking the directions to a recipe, the bar stating ""Tap to rate on Yummly"" is a bit annoying and obstructing, it takes away screen real estate. I know the developers of Yummly are trying to encourage their new function of posting user (or rather, chef/baker) reviews, but I feel as if the function were prominent enough that there is no need for the bar near the bottom of the screen. The app crashes only occasionally after browsing for a looong time, but overall it's one of the best recipe apps I've seen!"
11905,11905,5,2016-02-25T20:11:10.000Z,007KJack007,Nice App,"I really do like this app. It's good for looking up, and sharing recipes. You can chose what kinds of foods you do or do not like. The app will show you only the recipes that appeal to you, and your taste. You can also review the recipes to let others know how they turned out. Whether you like them, or not. Also, you can add ingredients from the recipes to a shopping list in the app. It allows you to check off the list. There is also an option to order these ingredients. However, there isn't a grocery delivery service in my area. But it does have the feature for those who do."
11906,11906,3,2016-03-23T17:32:32.000Z,sbtokarz,Missing 2 Features,"Yummly needs to introduce an easier way to organize favorite recipes in ""All Yums"" into collections after the user has clicked the Yum/Like button on a recipe page. I have hundreds of Yums and no way to organize them other than to enter each individual recipe page and Add To List. Maybe a multi-select feature that would allow moving multiple Yums into categories? This would make the custom collection feature more attractive too as I could more easily build a menu from favorite recipes that I've tried in the past."
11907,11907,5,2017-01-16T19:06:30.000Z,bg-inator,Great!,"I've never used such a convenient recipe app before. Two things that can improve out of the millions of things I love is when getting an item on your grocery list it should know that I need a specific amount of a thing when more than one recipe is calling for it. Instead of having seven ""jasmine rice"" items to click. The second is instead of taking me to the website and needing to scroll through the bs of a lady talking about her day and how funny it was making it last time I want to just see the directions I don't care for the extra stuff."
11908,11908,4,2017-01-28T15:11:41.000Z,pgdoit,Adventurous Cuisine,The app helps alleviate the doldrums of coming up with a menu every week.  Just enter your food preferences and bingo a new adventure in cuisine is at your fingertips if you want to try something new.  Shopping list feature is a plus but could use some cross referencing functionality for similar ingredients across different recipes.  Also infrequently the preparation instructions are not immediately apparent with a speed video. Having to hit pause more than a couple of times when my hands are deep six in preparing the dish does not work for me.   I was an unimaginative zombie dinner preparer and this app opened me up to other possibilities.
11909,11909,4,2017-08-24T18:54:02.000Z,MommieVazquez,"Pretty good, not perfect","I've used Yummly now for over a year. I like that my recipe box is so accessible and you can search for recipes so easily. My biggest gripe with the app is that to view the recipe directions it takes you to the website where there are tons of ads or other junk on the websites that can make it difficult to actually get to the recipe. Thank goodness for food bloggers, really, but c'mon please don't make me scroll for 3 full minutes, X out of 6 ads and get redirected inadvertently trying to access the wonderful goodness that is the recipe's directions. If Yummly could figure that out, I for one would be especially happy."
11910,11910,5,2014-10-04T21:32:45.000Z,Seeliejane,Use it everyday!,"The app functions very well, and it includes many recipe and cooking blogs I already love! I really like this app, and use it all the time. I also like the categories you can choose, and make yourself, to save the recipes you like. Overall, I'm very pleased with the app, with both performance, and the information available. It only makes it easier to find recipes online, but it is my go to. I think people expect too much from apps, it's not yummlys job to make sure Every cook has all the nutritional info for every recipe! Anyway I love it."
11911,11911,3,2015-02-23T01:11:25.000Z,plaintiger,great app being ruined by ads,"love this app. love that it lets me choose what kind of cuisine I want to see recipes for ‚Äì if I don't want to see dead animals in my recipes, I just tell the app that, and voil√†! ‚Äì no dead animals in my recipes. a beautiful and important function that all too few recipe apps and websites provide."
11912,11912,2,2015-11-13T00:38:26.000Z,A_Happy_Baker,New update causes crashing,I was an avid user of the app and loved it. Then it upgraded to Version 2.0. That's when the problem started. And it didn't just happen to me. It happened to many people. The app would crash either upon opening or after several minutes of use. But now the have released an update to fix that bug. The only problem I have with the update is that it didn't fix the problem for me. The app still crashes upon opening. I upped my rating from 1 start to 2 stars because it's seemed to have helped others. But it hasn't helped me.
11913,11913,5,2015-11-20T14:12:37.000Z,MadSwag Nyron,The BEST yet!!!,"This app is the best for every cook, baker there is. Omg you can type in a recipe and it will search numerous web pages and let you select what ever one you desire. Plus one easy button allows you to save recipes quickly to your recipe box without refreshing the page. And I like the fact that I can have hundreds of recipes saved but when I go to my yums saved recipes instead of scrolling down the long list looking for a particular recipe, I can just type in a couple of letters at the top of the page and my save recipe pops up."
11914,11914,3,2016-01-11T18:26:52.000Z,Boogsydoo,Lipstick on a pig,"While the app is visually quite nice, the experience is frustrating. If your screen goes to sleep in the middle of cooking and you unlock your phone again, the app refreshes to the home screen, forcing you to click through many steps to get back to your recipe. When this is happening upwards of 10 times in the middle of cooking, you may as well not even use the app."
11915,11915,4,2016-01-27T14:04:14.000Z,einstein749,"Great, but....","Okay, I'm giving this app 4 stars because it really is great, despite one major flaw, which I am counting on being fixed soon. That major flaw is the recipes not updating and displaying correctly in the yum categories. Countless others have commented on this as well. To the developers: please fix ASAP!"

11917,11917,5,2016-07-15T21:41:45.000Z,Standarich,Use it every day,I really love this app. I am on it daily looking for new recipes to make for my husband. The only thing that is a little disappointing. People do not give reviews of the recipes. I love looking at how they liked the recipe. What did they do to make it better. I wished more people would take the time to review each recipe. I also do not like that you can't print off the recipe. You have to waste your phone or tablet batteries. Also when you get recipes in your email every time you want to save a recipe you have to log in. Drives me batty.
11918,11918,5,2016-08-01T18:28:22.000Z,Catherine Janell Stacey,WHERE HAS THIS BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE,"I just spent the last hour going through this app (which I happened upon looking at a recipe online) and I haven't found ONE thing I don't like. It does everything all the other grocery and recipe apps couldn't do combined! It groups your ingredients, it's sensitive to dietary restrictions only showing you recipes you can eat, and it's so freaking easy to make an exact list of what you need so you don't overspend. I'm literally dying of happiness right now."

11920,11920,5,2014-03-17T17:16:52.000Z,Letletlaf,Great for meal planning,"I've been practicing a style of meal planning for a year now after failing to find an app that meets it. Finally I can across this app and I'm a very happy cook! It allows me to create a queue of meals based on what I selected and bought ingredients for. I can also easily find a recipe whenever I spot a good deal in the supermarket and know what items I still need to get. I like that I can adjust the serving in a snap, which helps while I'm shopping. I find it very easy to use as I'm not tied to a specific database or website. What an awesome app this one is!"
11921,11921,3,2015-04-25T21:36:39.000Z,Jams FAIRYTALE,"Great pics, nutrition, and search abilities","Like using this app, but they need to update features. Unable to easily adjust your saved recipies, and once you have created a 'board' you are unable to delete it. Editing is not simple... even sometimes impossible. You can search within your recipies but only by words included in the title... Not by ingredients, which would prove EXTREMELY helpful especially when you are trying to clean out the fridge or only have a few ingredients on hand. If they changed that and allowed for the ability to edit and select more than one recipe at a time while doing so this would be the best app out there!!!"
11922,11922,5,2015-08-22T18:10:26.000Z,Gencam,My Go To Cook Book,The Yummly App is the best free food recipe app that I've found. I've downloaded a few others but always used this app. You can basically search the ingredient you have and they give you so many recipes. Plus it give you the calories and ingredients needed for the recipe. It would be cool if there was another tab with what cooking / baking utensils and or equipment you will need. Sometimes that's the deal breaker for me that I may have all the ingredients but not have the equipment in my kitchen. Overall I love this app and I know others would too.
11923,11923,5,2016-01-10T16:40:32.000Z,meglemkey,BEST recipe app BY FAR,"I have tried many apps for recipes, but Yummly is the only one I continue to use. Each recipe I have made so far is simple and delicious! Tastiest recipes, simple to use, easy to remember the app. Easy to link multiple devices by logging in. The one criticism is that it was easy to lose which recipe I was making (a new screen showed up if I logged out then had to search through recipes to get back to the correct one - hopefully I remembered the exact name) until I realized I had to Yum and categorize it before getting started."

11925,11925,5,2016-07-14T13:20:04.000Z,alis135,Amazing!,"When I downloaded this app, I figured it was going to be similar to Pinterest. Definitely not!! The amount of recipes they offer are amazing! There are so many different ways to make one recipe that you'll never get bored! My family and I have found so many easy, delicious, and flavorful recipes that we have fallen in love with! The fact that I can make lists such as Dinners, Snacks, Liked, Not Liked, make it so easy to keep track and remember what I have saved and tried!"
11926,11926,3,2016-10-17T05:35:14.000Z,Liss131984,Really good app but...,"I find that I really enjoy this app. It's always getting new recipes, which is awesome. The only thing I have found an issue with is the nutrition category. There are many recipes on here that have outrageous calories counts. In most cases it for things that have simple ingredients that could never add up to the amount of calories listed. Unless they are considering the count for the entire dish. In which, they need to change the amount per serving tab as well. I'm always trying to eat healthy and when I find a good recipes and want it to stay in my calorie realm; I end up not using them. Due to this error in the app. Or at least what I perceive as an error."
11927,11927,5,2017-02-22T01:47:19.000Z,Viistaree,So convenient!,It's so nice to have the internets worth of cookbooks and chef blogs all in one place. I have made so many recipes I found using this app and not one has let me down. I especially love the 'no sleep' feature when I'm looking at a recipe. It so convenient to not have to touch my phone or iPad to unlock the screen when I'm right in the middle of cooking and need to look at the next step or the amount of an ingredient I need. And the customizable categories make it easy to find recipes I've already saved to create the perfect meal.

I was thrilled to find and app, which would exclude specific food items. It does not. Recommended recipes consistently have the two foods I avoid. A second complaint: the app is not intuitive. I love the idea of the convenience of an app finding recipes with the foods I have on hand as advertised and have yet to be able to find it on the app. Blah."

Mostly it has been for lack of knowing what to cook or what ingredients to buy at the grocery store. Since I downloaded this app, I've found myself cooking a lot more and eating out less. It lets you browse suggested recipes, search and save for later.  The recipes have ingredient lists that you can use to add items to a shopping list. This is very helpful when planning meals and trips to the grocery store. This app has been a positive in my life."
11931,11931,4,2015-12-05T03:23:40.000Z,URBROD,Excellent app!,"I would have given it a 5 star if it wasn't for one thing that makes it a little annoying when you are multitasking on you phone or if the phones locks, the issue is, sometimes if you unlock your phone you will find the recipe you were working on disappeared. It goes back to the main screen of the app. So if you didn't save the recipe you were cooking, it can be a little annoying trying to find it while you are cooking and your kids are screaming. But maybe that's an apple mistake, I don't know."
11932,11932,3,2015-12-19T20:21:19.000Z,Now This!,"Not awful, not great.","Older versions seemed to work better for me. I agree with other reviewers regarding glitches such as not being able to see all of my saved yums and starting at the home screen after phone locks, but equally as aggravating is the app locking up when in the ""directions"" tab (too many ads or scripts running?), and that it asks repeatedly if you want to see what others in your area are cooking (no, still don't). I think it would be nicer to organize my saved yum categories alphabetically. Hopefully, they'll get some of the freeze-up bugs worked out (because nobody likes bugs in their kitchen)."
11933,11933,4,2016-01-12T16:36:11.000Z,Shellnae,In a pinch,I must say that I really do use this app more than searching the web or opening a cookbook.

I love the shopping list feature that lets you add the ingredients for every recipe straight to a list that is editable! If you have the ingredient already, you just heck it off and it leaves everything else there. Make shopping a breeze and I can add my incidentals on there too and use it right in the store. It's also great for party planning--you can create a folder to save recipes for all your upcoming events. Get this now! You won't be sorry!"

The only issue is that I have diet constraints and not all recipes properly list ingredients -- so even with the filter, there are a lot of things which come up that I cannot eat. I feel like this is very important to correct. I have changed them if I could or sent in a report that something needs correcting, but I'd rather Yummly staff just take care of this without my intervening, because if I do a web search for recipes, I rarely get things that I can't eat. I feel like this area of things could use serious improvement, especially with how many people have dietary restrictions."

Fine to have a few articles & videos, but there are way to many. And they are often meaningless. I don't need a video to show me how to quickly peel an apple or how to cut bread for stuffing. What's next? A video showing how to pour milk on cereal? I'm really here for the recipes."

It's efficient, allowing the user to search recipes based on ingredients you may have on hand, or by specific types of recipes (i.e., ""pound cake,"" as an example). You can save your favorites, create a recipe box sorted however makes sense to you, and create shopping lists. Best of all, the database is exhaustive. A search for a recipe may pull up recipes from magazines, such as Martha Stewart or Southern Living, as well as from blogs throughout the internet. Well done, folks at Yummly!"

I love that I can set my dietary preferences in order to avoid digging through a bunch of recipes I'll never use. I'm only shown vegan recipes. I choose my recipe and put the ingredients that I need on my shopping list. I usually go for simple yet flavorful recipes, but you can go all out of you want; the variety is great. I really have  been cooking a lot more and have grown in confidence in the kitchen. This app is great!"

It had never crashed before today, I was telling my lil sister about it at dinner tonight, and it kept crashing. I rebooted my phone, and it kept crashing. I am going to try to re-install and hopefully that will help. I love it so much that I really don't mind so much if it wants to take a break. Amazing app!"

Search for specific recipes, or just type in broccoli to find recipes that use broccoli, then add ingredients to my shopping list, and send the list to my hubby, or shop with the check list in the app. Awesome! BUT the advertisements interfere with the cooking directions so often that I usually just go to the source of the recipe when it's time to cook. I'd pay money to make the ads go away but I haven't found that as an option, so I only gave the app 4 stars. But this app is DEFINITELY worth downloading."

First of all it filters depending on food allergies, food you don't like, and what dietary preference you are -vegan, vegetarian, or paleo-, which is wonderful. Second, when signing up it first asks what gender you are, then it asks what you identify as. I got so so happy, I, myself, am not trans* but I'm very close to people who are and it's hard for them when they have to choose between male and female when asked. Oh, and the recipes are very very good! üòã"

It has recipes for EVERY occasion. Breakfast, snack time, lunch, dinner, dessert, smoothies, and other drinks. In the app all the ingredients are listed, you can change the serving size and the ingredient amount will change to what the serving needs. If you don't have an ingredient you have a shopping list that reminds you what you need for a certain recipe. I haven't  looked on any other cooking website since I got this app! It is a must!"

It should remember you. It's also slower on the iPad than on the iPhone. Sometimes it also just closes on its own. I also wish they would include FODMAP friendly foods as a choice in the filters for those of us who have fructose malabsorption. I know I'm nitpicking, but perhaps this will help make the app better!  Love the shopping list and tons of awesome recipes and the layout. Thumbs up."
11946,11946,5,2016-10-17T20:09:46.000Z,Rockabocks Forever,Awesome!,"I love yummly because it gives me tons of recipes that aren't too hard to make. I'm a vegetarian so when I started with the app, I could choose that I was a vegetarian and all of the meals now don't have meat.  It also had a list of food you could choose from that you didn't like or type in your own. I use it all the time to cook. I also like how the recipes are constantly being updated and new recipes coming in. I would definitely get this app if you're looking for new recipes or fun things to cook."
11947,11947,4,2016-11-12T04:45:28.000Z,Bartemis Maximus,"Convenient, but...","The app is easy to use, and focuses on recipes based on your food profile choices. But most of the recipes are links to other sites that sometime require signing up and logging into their site to view the recipes. About 50% of the recipes, even followed to a T, have been pretty terrible. I'm vegan, so I'm used to frequently bland food. But what I can't stand is vague recipes with instructions like ""a few"" or ""some"" quantity of an ingredient, and/or recipes that clearly the creator never actually tasted... undoubtedly a concept that sounded good in concept, but was terrible in execution."
11948,11948,4,2016-12-16T14:55:55.000Z,Mars256,"Good service, sort of annoying interface.","The ability to set dietary restrictions so that you never have to see something you can't eat (thus avoiding the timesink of finding suitable recipes on Google or social media) is the reason I use this, and it does that job very well."
11949,11949,5,2017-02-10T23:31:28.000Z,chumani347,Amazing!!!,"I absolutely love this app.  So many great ideas for every occasion. My family loves that I started using this app as well.  Quick, easy meals that break us out of our normal routine.  Additionally, my husband and I (as we are becoming older) have decided to eat healthier and live a healthier lifestyle.  This app really makes it easier to do this.  Best part is that my teen daughter and younger grade school daughter love these healthier food choices.  They taste so good they don't realize how good it is for them!  I use this app everyday; an absolute must!"

For example, if I liked chocolate cake, all I see are a million different chocolate cake recipes. I no longer see random food recipes and it seems like I have to put in some/more effort to find other food. I'm not familiar with many recipes at all so this makes it difficult for me and I wonder if other people like me find that as a tiny problem as well. Otherwise, not bad at all."

I've only made 2 things I didn't absolutely love, and I've used this a lot already. The best thing is that it allows you to add the necessary ingredients to your shopping list, no papers and pens required :) Plus, it also suggests other recipes you might like based on previous group recipe choices. It has really helped me build my cooking repertoire, and my friends, family, and tummy thank you Yummly üòã"
11953,11953,5,2015-08-13T15:42:08.000Z,Derby City Rambler,Culinary Delight,I. Love. This. App. Amazing. This app makes cooking fun. Being able to share and use people's own recipes makes for a truly unique experience. I've been able to tweak recipes to my own liking and have yet to have a bad dish. I love the grocery list option as well. The instructions on some of the recipes are a bit dodgy at times but otherwise it's put together well. Because of this app I've been cooking more and I have found myself excited to find my next culinary adventure.
11954,11954,4,2015-09-02T05:29:54.000Z,DNSC,What a great app!!!!,"I looove the recipes, the shopping list, the way you can customize dietary needs. It is the best app I have tried for this kind of thing.  My 5 year old has a gluten sensitivity and it has been hard for me to find delicious recipes that the whole family would like, but thank God I found tons of ideas here.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it had a meal planner calendar so I don't forget the name of the recipes I had planned and shopped for. :))).  I would totally recommend this app to friends and family.  I'm very happy with it."
11955,11955,5,2015-11-14T06:56:00.000Z,Blanelax,Excellent!,"This is the greatest app for recipes! Before you get started your asked to fill out how many people you cook for, what types of foods you like (Mexican, Italian, etc), what ingredients you don't like, and what kind of cook you are: beginner, intermediate, advanced. Then it gives you endless recipes with beautiful pictures, list of ingredients to print out for shopping and the recipe to print. So simple. It's super fun and addicting, like Pinterest!  Highly recommend!  I've already used several recipes and they were delish!!!"
11956,11956,5,2015-11-28T17:32:44.000Z,Tbrooks1107,App Saved Thanksgiving,"I love this app.  I procrastinated on getting my turkey day recipes together this year.  I had never used this app, but thought I would try.  It saved my families Thanksgiving.  The recipes I wanted were so easy to find and the shopping list was exactly what I needed to organize my last minute shopping trip.  I was able to text myself the list and I had one of the easiest Thanksgiving cooking days ever.  Plus my family raved over the new recipes I had made.  Thank you! I love the app!"
11957,11957,4,2016-08-03T02:53:45.000Z,JKS4S,Great for planning but not syncing,"I love this app for meal planning and avoiding purchasing unnecessary items. It also takes the stress out of what's for dinner since I just scroll through my ""yummed"" recipes. I do not like how it seems impossible to sync my phone app to my online account - or even find items on one when easily located on the other, which means I ""yum"" less and have to use my phone during all meal prep. I've found some ways to work around those headaches and use the app several times a week as well as for all grocery trips."
11958,11958,5,2017-05-27T15:44:23.000Z,Vanessa Mom,Best recipe app.,"This app has thousands (or more) of recipes. I can type in for example, avocado, and it gives me a bunch of recipes with avocados in it. It lets you save and categorize your favorite recipes. This app tells you the amount of servings per meal. It gives you the nutritional info. The app gives you the directions and sometimes additional pictures. The app also lets you customize you preferences, example, vegan, gluten free, allergic to tomato, dislike beets."
11959,11959,3,2017-09-10T14:11:10.000Z,djfriedman1981,Not the best for grocery lists,"Just got this and really struggling with the grocery list feature. It adds in the ingredients for recipes you find on the app, but when I want to add other things, it often glitches to where I can't see all of the things on my list. Not going to use it if I can't add more things to my grocery list without other things disappearing."
11960,11960,4,2013-11-05T00:09:53.000Z,Amballet,"Love app, want reviews","I love the app and how it pulls recipes from everywhere.  All have been great so far.  But I wish yummly had their own reviews of recipes and a place to leave comments on it.  The only way I've been able to do that is through Facebook and I haven't been able to see anyone else's reviews.  And sometimes you are not able to see the reviews of the recipe on the site it was pulled from unless you leave yummly and some don't have reviews.  I would love yummly to have its own rating, reviews, comments aspect added.  Other than that LOVE it!"
11961,11961,5,2014-12-23T05:46:42.000Z,Tacit-Bud,Love this app.,I love the UI in this app along with ease of use. By simply searching what you want to cook you get a vista of possibilities for that search. One suggestion I would make is that sometimes the ingredients aren't visible if the ingredient has a long name. Since there's no way to really see the entire ingredient because the app doesn't go into landscape mode. Please just make the ingredient more accessible so that there are no mistakes made in purchasing. Otherwise phenomenal app. Keep up the great work guys. You rock!!
11962,11962,5,2015-03-06T14:01:15.000Z,Pieipod,yumm-O!,"I use this app several times a day. I am a diabetic that is constantly looking for healthy meal choices. The nutritional values are listed and the suggestions made for me based on my searches is fantastic! The grocery list is a huge help when shopping. I always carry my phone, and I always forget the lists I write! Hehe Now it's always with me. The only thing I would change would be how some recipes are pages to navigate through to get to the ""meat"" of the recipe. Other than that? Perfection! üëç"
11963,11963,5,2015-09-06T04:08:36.000Z,Cegalphl,I adore this app!!,"Can't tell you how many food apps I went through prior to finding yummly! Others that claimed to do what yummly actually does paled in comparison. Their recipes were either way too involved, too basic, or just didn't taste good. I have yet to cook a recipe I've found on yummly that wasn't a hit with my family/friends. It is probably the most functional app I have on my phone. It's kind of obscene how often in a week I recommend it to others. Yummly, if you ever need a spokesperson, I'm your gal! üòÜ"
11964,11964,2,2015-09-21T20:49:50.000Z,Wrave,Needs work,"Yummly delivers on its promise of being a recipe aggregator. However, while it is a blessing towards variety, Yummly's dependance on web-posted recipes is a curse to its usability. Often recipe web sites are clunky and don't operate well in the embedded browser. Often the overhead of Yummly plus the web page it has loaded uses enough RAM that if I switch to a timer and back, Yummly can't remember where I was, leaving me stranded. Yummly doesn't actually make the process of cooking any smarter, it's just a glorified search engine, and if you are lucky that the web page it refers to won't be verbose to the point that you'll burn your food before you find your place again."
11965,11965,5,2016-01-31T19:09:39.000Z,C.Berg,Love this app,"I love this app, I use it to expand my recipe book and to try new things for my family. It's a great asset to my recipe box...I have already found several ""Yums"" that are keepers! The shopping list feature is AMAZING & BRILLIANT!! The only thing I wish was different on this app was that I could add in my own recipes for me to see. This would make shopping and weekly meal planning soooo much easier! I find myself trying 7 new recipes each week just to make the shopping and planning easier."
11966,11966,5,2016-02-10T15:35:27.000Z,Arickard,"Intuitive, robust, easy to use.","Yummly is an easy, quick app to use for those, like me, who are frequently ""on the go"".  It pairs me with a variety of meals and technique levels that I can choose from based on my mood and timeframe. I can customize my feed based on ingredients either I or my family likes or dislikes, which is key. It helps me with meal planning for the upcoming week by giving me a shopping list as well. I am very choosy about which apps I subscribe to and this was a very good choice for me."
11967,11967,5,2016-08-29T03:05:28.000Z,Nene_09,Great visual,Love the app.  I happened to find this by chance and have used it ever since.  I'm new to the cooking game and this app has been such a large help.  I also love that all the recipes have a visual to go along with them which makes my decision easier on whether to try that dish or not.   I also love how you can tailor made your preferences with food and allergies you have to where the app only gives you recipes excluding the items that are less than desirable to you.   Best food app ever!!!
11968,11968,5,2016-12-27T16:58:11.000Z,Petunea Princess,Great for organizing and trying new recipes,"Yummly is a great little app for finding new recipes, organizing recipes into categories, and making a shopping list from an entire menu plan. You can also add other recipes you find online to Yummly and easily print. My favorite feature is the shopping list, which organizes ingredients by category to make shopping easier and consolidates like items so you know how much you need of one ingredient that's called for multiple recipes."
11969,11969,5,2017-08-23T19:01:38.000Z,they asked me a question...,Great app for Vegans,In settings you have the option to hit vegan and Yummly will only search those recipes.  The only draw back is searching for modifications and veganized versions of traditional or vegetarian recipes is difficult.  I've sent feedback and hope that something can be worked out.
11970,11970,2,2014-12-21T15:48:32.000Z,jlynntc,Can't even read the recipe without...,"The app taking me back to the iTunes Store to purchase more advertised apps. Every single time I clicked on a dish to get more details it the app would automatically open the iTunes app to buy or download apps such as Uber and Lyft.  I just downloaded this app today and it's pointless every time I go back to the recipe it directs me to the App Store like 6 seconds later. Sadly this app isn't for me, going to be deleting it now. Wish I could have actually used this app.  I hope the creators also are made aware of this advertising issue so they can somehow correct it and people can actually read this recipe without interruptions."
11971,11971,4,2015-03-26T20:51:18.000Z,JuliaEspinosa,The user experience is second to none,"The only reason this app isn't getting 5 stars (yet - I'm sure the developers will continue improving) is because when I hit the ""back"" symbol to leave the recipe and go back to the ""home feed,"" it refreshes and takes me back to the very top, causing me to lose my precious place in the stream of recipes. If this were fixed and I could return to the home screen, the app would get a solid 5 stars. Beautiful user experience, detailed nutritional info, and awesome categorization options."
11972,11972,5,2015-05-20T23:19:32.000Z,Savvibear,Love this App!!,"I have the hardest time trying to figure out what to have for dinner. I'm not much of a preparer. I look in the fridge, the freezer and pantry and think.... Nope, we don't have nothin... Even though they're mostly full. I just don't know how to throw things together. This app has helped me tremendously! If I'm looking for a side dish, I'll just type in easy side dish and scroll through till I find something I have and that looks easy enough. If you need any kind of recipe, just search it. That simple."
11973,11973,5,2015-09-04T19:46:15.000Z,Widleydoodle333,Yummly is amazing,I used to google all of the recipes I wanted when it was time to cook. Then I would have to start the process over if I wanted to make it again. This app lets you keep a virtual recipe box and I never have to worry about losing a recipe I like... And there are thousands of delicious new things to experiment with in the kitchen once you start using this app! I also love the filters that are available! I have found lots I dele opus healthy recipes with no sugar! :) 5 stars from me!
11974,11974,5,2015-09-17T04:08:17.000Z,Awesome in every way!!!!!!,Awesome app I use it all the time!,"I love Pinterest... however with Yummly there is virtually no searching for recipes!! Pretty much can go straight to them instead of searching and searching and searching like I did on Pinterest! Then the added plus of being able to make menus by days of the week that's how I use it, I love it! It makes your shopping list very easy. I have a grocery shopping list app that I don't even use anymore that I've used for over five years!"

However, when it comes time to prep and cook, I like to play music off my phone. Yet when I go to this app to look at instructions, it stops the audio from wherever I'm playing music."
11976,11976,5,2016-02-16T19:51:22.000Z,Ajjrandj,Easy and tasty,"I love this app because I can search for anything and can usually find multiple recipe options or I can browse and find new recipes. I like that I can save and organize my recipes so I can find them later. With so many iffy recipes out there, I like that when I click on a recipe it takes me to the original website where I can usually find reviews as well as see how many yummly likes there are for a recipe, so I don't waste my time on a complete dud."

When I use it from my PC, it's easy to download and print them out. However, when I'm not home and use the app from my phone, it becomes a chore to download the entire recipe's directions! I get so frustrated after the 3rd or 4th try, I just go to a different site, where the recipes are easy to download. Why do you have to go thru so many steps and why don't the icons reveal what they do? If it was easier, I'd rate it 5 stars as I cook a lot!!"

With Yummly, I'm able to make grocery list quickly. It seems as though there are so few ingredients in the recipes I'm looking at and they're super simple. I'm encouraged to try new things and not stuck in the rut of the same recipes over and over again. This is the first recipe app that I've ever used, and I'm not gonna try anything else!"

But I think it's slightly more irritating when you do have an account but they won't let you access it. Anytime I click in the login, it just loads forever (w/ the little steaming pot; I'm beginning to hate that pot). I haven't found anything to fix this prob, and not being able to at least save recipes makes this app pointless for me. Please just let me save recipes."

Very useful but one thing I couldn't understand while reading some of these ratings is everyone loves this app (which they should) except for a few but their reasoning is they don't want to sign on Google.. I say for those complaining about that should go back to the olden days where you look up recipes in books and stay off the online recipes if you want to complain about something so stupid.. This app is amazing

They taught me their homemade recipes of some of my favorite dishes! I was excited to find Yummly because I was able to save my grandmothers recipes, including how to cook them (temperatures etc). The whole process was really easy. I use iCloud to back up my phone so when I had to buy a new phone, I wasn't worried about loosing all of my recipes or any other content for that matter. WELLLLLL come to find out, after logging back into Yummly EVERY SINGLE ONE of my grandmothers recipes was DELETED!! So I no longer use Yummly for anything. Writing down my recipes is way more reliable than an app!!"

Love that we can mix and match multiple ideas from many recipes we've saved to find the best one for us to keep going back to easily. It's been a life saver when looking to fill that craving with a healthy Paleo alternative simply and easily and organized. Sometimes freezes occasionally when looking at the web sites directions page, but once it clears it seems to be ok again.  Maybe a minor glitch but still way worth the occasional hiccup."

I love that I can save recipes to a collection for future use and to stay organized. The app also helps recommend recipe and refine searches based on my dietary restrictions and personal preferences. The best part is the shopping list feature. I always add the ingredients I want to buy for a specific recipe and check them off in the app when I'm in the store. Very helpful!!

I do suggest the option to save whole categories of ""We think you may like."" A lot of times it's too many to go through in one sitting, but I like some of them. Also, having the option of not having the lighting on your phone time out while looking at recipes would be a useful addition.

Each recipe also includes the time to prepare and cook. Absolutely, a must have for beginners and cooking enthusiasts alike. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how amazingly reliable the recipes are. I receive so many compliments when I prepare a Yummly recipe."

11997,11997,3,2015-11-15T21:43:07.000Z,The Archre,Lost potential,"I really do love Yummly, but it's deeply flawed. You can't save your own recipes or create meal plans- I'm constantly switching between this and my notebook app. The search engine is also very irritating. You can search by ingredient, but not by things like ""sides"" or ""light lunch"" or ""Mediterranean;"" you'll only get hits on things that happen to have put these in their recipe title or ingredient list, not necessarily the type of food you're looking for, so half the time it's just easier to google ideas to cook. I like it, but it's lacking and very backward from what technology is capable of."

The filters in the settings can be set to search by ingredients, cooking time, in settings you can adjust for the number of guests, and more. It displays nutritional information and tips in the directions. I truly think it is the best cooking app out there. That is my opinion and I am 56 yrs old and have been cooking since I was 15 yrs old."

Excellent layout, easy to use, great recipes, easy to save into your own categories or preset categories. Easy to search by category or specific ingredient. Love how it caters to your exact life style. The kinds of foods you eat, what goes in them, what kind of food you like to eat, diets and allergies. I will never need another cook book again. By far the most perfect app ever invented. I can't even think of how to make it any better. Love love love"

Tons of wonderful delicious recipes at my fingertips, a search option, clear easy directions and smart find after you start using it. The only real problem is that if you don't have wifi you can't access or use the recipes when your shopping to see what you need to buy. The other problem is looking at all the delicious food will make you hungry..."

12002,12002,3,2015-01-13T20:49:20.000Z,Thatsmybaby,"Great tool, could be better!","First off, this app is amazing for discovering new recipes from all over the web. I love how easy it is to create shopping lists from recipes on other sites. The biggest thing missing from the Yummly app is a true weekly meal planning feature. As it is set up right now, you can only file recipes into categories. It would be great if you could create the shopping list for an entire week's worth of meals, and assign each meal to a different day. Having this feature would  be key for my use, and take the app from 3 to 5 stars!"
12003,12003,5,2015-03-25T16:23:47.000Z,luvmykid28,Delicious App,I can honestly tell you that I have tried many of the recipes I put in my collections and have only been disappointed a couple of times. I use it almost daily. I love the grocery list feature. I make my menus from it. We have stopped eating out as much because the food I prepare from this app is so amazing!!! I am gluten free and it is easy to find recipes to fit my needs. I can't say enough about it. GET THIS APP and use it! Your tummy will thank you.

Once I've found a group of recipes I want to be able to sort them by rating. Not going to waste my time making a dish that no one likes. With this app?  No sorting. Stupid. The rest of the interface is clunky and counterintuitive. I'm glad that your designers found out how to use the fancy slide features, and the accordion features, but I don't care how slick the app looks, I want to be able to find a recipe, see what's in it, and how to make it. All that other crap is secondary.  Deleting from my phone as soon as I post this review. Come back when you're app is a little more mature, Yummly."

My only problem so far is searching for specific blogs- sometimes I can find certain ones, but cannot get to others, however sometimes if I search for the specific recipe name I can get to some of their recipes, but again, not consistent . I just have several recipes from my favorite blogs that I would love to get uploaded but can't figure out how."

It's still great even if you're not on a meal plan, because there are loads of great recipes. You can set your preferences to however you like, to fit the needs of your current diet. If you see a recipe you like, you can add the ingredients to your grocery list by simply the click of a button. This app is so easy to use that you'd be missing out if you didn't download it immediately!"

It is a very well thought out and organized application the recipes that are complied in the database are extremely delicious and it allows my family and I to try new variations on old recipes easily. It had been extremely useful when our basement got remodeled and I wasn't able to have access to my library of  cookbooks for the holidays.
12009,12009,5,2017-05-02T22:18:14.000Z,dajaaj,Better Than Pinterest,"I was using Pinterest for my meals for the family but it drove me crazy when you would have open another window, and if you phone blacks out, when you re-open it would lose out all the Pinterest recipes and you would have to re-find again.  Yummly makes it easy to find new recipes by looking for things you like and when you have it open, it stays open!! Great app!!"

Not only are the recipes delicious, they are efficiently organized and well presented with mouth-watering photos. I like the color tones and hues as well as the fonts and types used by the app creators too. It enhances the recipe browsing experience. Everything is simple and neat...as with cooking, you don't need to complicate things, just as a few fresh ingredients treated with passion and care create an outstanding meal so too a great recipe app! Food lovers and cooks will love this app too!"

This app however has awesome pics and dishes out some good dishes I would consider trying. How many dishes have I actually done well 1 but that's a higher rating than my experience with any other app. Instructions are easy to read so they don't scare me off. Thank you! It's always been a dream of mine to cook more of my meals and now I found my motive to do so a.k.a Yummly

I'm always looking for something new and this gives simple recipes from all categories. I enjoy it has the separate tabs for ingredients , nutrition, and directions. All the ads under the directions can be a bit discouraging , resulting in the 4 not 5 stars, but all in all the app is wonderful and makes the "" never ending recipe search task""  for all us cooks a lot more pleasurable !!!"

12014,12014,4,2015-06-26T21:53:58.000Z,QE =^_^=,Easy and Convenient,Easy to use and has a lot of recipes to choose from. I like the shopping list feature because it's easy to just select an ingredient that I don't have without having to go to another app or writing it down. I've seen a few recipes online that aren't on the app and it needs a better personalization process since there are things people can dislike and like in one category. Other than that this is a definitely an app worth downloading.
12015,12015,4,2015-07-18T21:37:33.000Z,Artful process,Pretty good,"Yummly as it says in my title is pretty good. Not as comprehensive as a regular old cookbook. It does have a mass amount of recipes to choose from. Sometimes it may have too many recipes of just one item, but you can get a good over view of what might be a popular recipe or food craze. I will say this, Its helped me out in a few tight spots. Only negative, it can crash unexpectedly sometimes and even if your connection is good sometimes it can't search, or the thing your looking up can't be found."
12016,12016,3,2015-08-18T03:46:05.000Z,Mphadd,"Great idea and design, needs improvement","I love the look of this app and all the variety of recipes; however, I don't like that it takes me to an external site. I want to be able to print the recipes straight from my phone and for me to be able to select the ingredients and have them be compatible with my shopping list I already have on my phone so I can just export it. Also, I don't like they when I'm scrolling, it shows recipes I've already selected because I accidentally unselect them when I am trying to select them again"

The pictures make me drool, super inspiring. The recipes even have nutrition info. Also love the shopping list so it makes it super easy to discover and then execute the dishes. I am also able to put my recipes into collections so I can prep for an upcoming dinner party, put desserts ideas in one place. It really is limitless. Yummly has gone above and beyond."
12021,12021,5,2014-09-23T19:36:51.000Z,FLGatorOP,New Hobby thanks to Yummly!,I can't say enough great things about this app. Yummly has changed my family's eating. I know it sounds like a lot of credit but I have fallen in love with cooking after finding such great recipes here. The recipe sources Yummly pulls from are so much more interesting than the traditional recipe sites. My new hobby has led our family to so many exciting new meals and a healthier overall lifestyle thanks to the handy nutritional info! Thank you to the Yummly team!
12022,12022,5,2014-11-15T01:20:05.000Z,iBillpaton,I use it every day,Fantastic for novice or more advanced cooks. I use it for ideas and inspiration. It's especially great when you need ideas for new ingredients or combinations you're curious about. Features like the in app shopping list and yum list (favorites) are very handy. You can also customize suggestion to your particular dietary needs and see calories in each recipe. Interface is simple and easy. If you love to cook you'll love this app.
12023,12023,5,2015-04-10T12:47:18.000Z,LaurMarCar,Great for new ideas and fresh takes on old favorites,"I love this. Really easy to use and search. Search by ingredient or for something you always wanted to try. Plus I love the shopping list option so I can make sure I get everything I need plus add stuff I want separately. I like that it adds common ingredients together, but still separates by recipe. I really like this app and would encourage anyone who wants to cook often to get it."
12024,12024,5,2015-07-09T21:06:32.000Z,Christy D9,Great recipe app!,"I was getting tired of making the same old meals ( and eating them). This app has so many great recipes from very simple to very complex. I can find recipes for something simple on days when I barely have time for dinner to gourmet when I feel like making the extra effort. So when I'm in the mood I can find something new. Easy bookmarking for recipes I find and like, easy shopping lists. I absolutely love this app!"
12025,12025,5,2015-10-24T18:43:56.000Z,FValentine92,"Pretty handy app, I have to say.","This app is awesome. Instead of having to have 3 different recipe apps along with a bajillion bookmarks under a recipe tab, I can have them all in one place. On top of the fact that the app has a separate tabs for ingredients and preparations which makes it hella easy to make a recipe without having to constantly scroll up and down the page like you would when using a browser."

I am now eating healthy, learning new ways to cook, and overall living in a healthier lifestyle! In this app you will find tons of delicious recipes, you can estimate the calories you want on a meal and the bonus part is that you can get your favorite food list deliver right to your door!  Would recommend to friends!"

I have three teens and I had kind of gotten tired of the daily grind of cooking, but yummly inspires me with beautiful pictures, and ideas. Do yourself and those you cook for a huge favor and get yummly. It's my automatic source for ideas and so much easier than Pinterest. No more getting lost in a maze. Yummly inspires you yet is very efficient. Just say yes !!"

However, when you touch Directions, most always you get the originator's web page which is almost impossible to navigate because it is not formatted for a phone screen: text on top of itself, lots of ads piled in on top of things also. It's such a hassle. Couldn't you please format the directions within Yummly to"
12029,12029,5,2016-11-01T20:19:02.000Z,No multi?,Convenient,"I love this app. I've been using it for about a year. It is super convenient to have quick access to all of the recipes on the web, as well as recommendations just for me."
12030,12030,4,2013-10-16T13:48:37.000Z,Winshoe,Really nice,This app is really great. There are only two things that I would change:
12031,12031,5,2014-07-18T14:40:46.000Z,HealthDesi,Best Food App on the IPhone,"I used a lot if website to cook but this is by far the easiest way to find new dishes that you like. Recently, I decided to cook clean and have been having trouble eating food without getting bored but this app makes it far easier to find new recipes which I have never thought of before. Whether it is to find meals for the perfect meal plan or cooking for a family gathering, this app is well worth it."
12032,12032,5,2015-04-03T14:10:49.000Z,HaberdashPI,App itself is great,"I use this app frequently and with great success in finding recipes. The predictive algorithm seems to have improved as well so that I often find I am interested in the suggested recipes. The structure of the recipes themselves can be cumbersome. Many I have used are within someone's blog post about their cooking experience which makes it hard to find the directions in the story. Over all, very useable."
12033,12033,5,2015-04-15T15:06:05.000Z,Coleerosie,Cooking Novice - Great App,"I'm newly married and was terrified to cook because it is something I was just never interested in. This lovely app gathers extremely quick, easy and delicious recipes together with ease. I love the shopping list feature. I'm actually enjoying cooking now and my husband has had no complaints. The only thing I wish there was a better search feature to search food by ingredients or cultural type."
12034,12034,1,2015-11-01T19:01:10.000Z,hummingcrow,Excessive ads spoil this app,"I'm sure all the described features are lovely. Unfortunately I'll never know. The constant delivery of ad after ad, both interspersed within the recipes and popping up and hiding the recipes so that I have to stop every 10 seconds and find the little x to dismiss the ad, truly spoiled my first recipe search. Uninstalled within 5 minutes. Yes I looked in settings and found no way to reduce ad frequency or pay to turn them off. If the app were useful, I'd pay once to turn off ads. But I'll never know because my time is more valuable than putting up with constantly obscured content. If I could give zero stars, I would."
12035,12035,5,2015-11-14T00:43:09.000Z,Tazsgrandma,Best recipe app,"I've used individual apps before but this app it is by far the best. Throw away the other ones. Yum Lee gets there recipes from all the other recipe sites, gives you beautiful pictures, make suggestions based on your preferences and diets. I have recommended this app to all my family members. Create in the grocery list, then get the directions. Save them as your favorites and pull them up at the grocery store."
12036,12036,3,2016-12-31T18:44:12.000Z,Lgdghjdv,Great but missing features,"This app has great recipes, but REALLY needs to add a search filter for diabetic dietary restrictions, or increase the allergens section to include low sugar, low calorie sections. It is hard when dieting when you can't turn off all of the amazing sweets that come up.  Also would be nice if there was a thumbs down so recipes that you don't like could be deselected so it doesn't keep coming up in searches. (Example I like seafood, but not raw seafood). While you can list foods you don't like, you can't do the same for specific recipes."

12038,12038,4,2017-02-16T04:37:18.000Z,Elysia M,Very good!,"I really like this app, it's good for browsing and filtering based on dietary restrictions. The recipes I've tried have been good too!  I really like the diversity you can find. My only frustrating is not being able to sort search results by how many other people have tried it, it's a pain to have the popular ones along with the obscure ones at the top of the search bar. Would recommend!  But excited to see if the developers have a good update"
12039,12039,5,2017-07-27T14:02:57.000Z,Clay jamin,Perfect recipe app,I got his because some other apps that have recipes are just so cluttered. I enjoy that this is an app specifically for recipes. It has dietary preferences and allergies that you only have to fill out once and are easy to change. It has a great variety of foods and is easy to organize. I had a concern about a recipe and the app support got back to me the same day and helped me through my confusion. Really well built app!
12040,12040,2,2013-10-06T18:51:47.000Z,GoOfyBOy,wish I could use all the functions,"I was very excited about this app until I realized that you can't use all the functions unless you connect it with a social media site.  I don't need everyone to see what recipe I am looking at or what I am shopping for.  maybe I will give it another chance after awhile to see if they have changed.  sorry just not for me.  I am not one of those people that ""check in"" everywhere they go.  I like social media sites but I also like my privacy and at the rate this world is going I don't know how much longer we will have any privacy."
12041,12041,5,2014-01-26T02:19:49.000Z,HeatherMarie12345,Great way to find recipes!,"I love this app! I have found tons of great recipes! I like being able to classify by type of meal especially. Also, the app takes you very easily to the recipe's we page, much easier than Pinterest does. And I like how you can get the list of ingredients separately without Even going to the web page. This makes it easier to determine if the recipe is what you are looking for."
12042,12042,1,2014-05-03T10:33:45.000Z,Hokieinotown,Looks like a great app but the sign in is not for me,"This app looks great but unfortunately I'll never know. You must sign in using either google+ or Facebook. I REFUSE to get a google+ account and I personally can't stand things that MUST go through Facebook. I understand Facebook gets your product out there and gets you exposure, but there's got to be a better way. You can view recipes without the login but you cannot like them/save them, use the grocery list or get recommendations customized to your likes...which is the main ""draw"" to the app. Thanks guys...but you've just got to change the login methods to include a login by email or something."
12043,12043,5,2015-07-27T01:29:08.000Z,Tempfera,A Paradise For Healthy Eating,"This app has made it ridiculously easy for my brother and I to eat the healthiest, tastiest, most diet oriented meals/drinks/smoothies we have ever had in our lives. Best part about it? It sticks to your personalized diet. Oh, and it recommends new things to you within your diet. Oh, and it's free. For now. 100% recommend for anyone that is on any diet, vegetarian, vegan, etc., or just simply wants to discover new foods and how to make them at home. Great job developers."

I have to delete the app and reload it to retrieve my saved recipe. I figured they would have fixed this after all the reviews stating the problem. I no longer use it, but do check to see if issue is fixed. For now I'm using the New York Times Cooking app."
12045,12045,5,2016-02-02T15:28:15.000Z,DeerStalker,Great recipes,"I really like this app.  As another reviewer stated, if your phone locks, you have to navigate through several steps to get back to your recipe.  Links in the directions tab won't open so you have to try search for the secondary recipe manually. Other than that the app is great and recipes look delicious.  I also love how the app asks for your skill level in cooking so you're not presented with overly complicated recipes."

12048,12048,4,2017-04-23T02:20:52.000Z,stephilippou,Great app,"Super useful for finding a variety of recipes from all over the internet.  Yummly also has advanced search features which helps you find the specific food you're looking for.  One issue is that when I search for foods based on nutritional value, the search doesn't properly filter the results.  For example, if I'm looking for a food with less than 10 grams of fat per serving it will still show foods with higher amounts of fat."

I recently found that, with the proper instructions I too can cook on more than the grill. I'm not sure if I'm any good due to the fact my wife says the best part of my meals are that she didn't have to cook them lol. So now I'm a hunter, fisherman, sports loving Harley riding COOK! I dare you to call this Redneck a sissy! But you are invited for a heaping mans meal."

But isn't,"I really wanted to like this but after the countless pop ups, the app constantly freezing and glitching, I'm finding something else. Every time you open or switch back it asks you for your location which gets really annoying, fast if you don't want to give up your info to their advertisers. I'm using an iPhone 6+ and it is still leggy, so I know it's not my phone that's running slow.  I really like the idea of the shopping list but it only works with certain recipes. Sigh"
12051,12051,2,2015-11-26T21:06:51.000Z,kingofmyjungle,Pop-ups and Ads from HELL,"The app is a testament of how to ruin a good product in the name of profits. Design is beautiful, the rest is basically useless leaving you spending more time trying to close pop-ups, or minimizing the 20,000 ads that cover most of the page. The Apple Watch app is useless, where the most obvious choice was to display the steps of a recipe instead of trying to be miniature version of the full app. It seems Yummly needs to go back to the drawing board and focus on getting back to its roots: providing a beautiful platform that is as user friendly as it is helpful."
12052,12052,5,2016-01-23T04:25:57.000Z,WhatDaPho??,Wonderful App!,I am ecstatic that I found this app when searching for recipes in the App Store. It's free and has amazing recipes and professional like photos of the meals. I've told all my friends and family about it. They love it! There's even a section to put your diet and your cuisine type. I love how you can save a recipe and even put the ingredients into a shopping list! Pure genius! Thank you sooooo much for making this app!
12053,12053,5,2016-07-06T23:09:17.000Z,Pancakes@midnight,My Go To,I appreciate the time and effort it takes to put an app like this together.  I like that it provides the sites information so that I can view other recipes.  It's my go to for something yummy and different.
12054,12054,5,2016-08-02T18:25:54.000Z,Kidinthekitchen,I love it,This app is amazing! It's perfect for those who want to find an exact recipe quick and easy. I love how it finds recipes that are recommended for you. My one complaint though is that the instructions to make a recipe are different depending on the recipe and there are so many ads and it makes it hard to read the instructions but besides that the app is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who loves to cook
12055,12055,5,2017-01-02T23:40:55.000Z,A lot of options,Really Great Recipes,I do use Yummly frequently. I enjoy categories so I can easily find something I want to make or remake again.
12056,12056,3,2017-01-05T17:12:08.000Z,UNTgregory,Needs improvement,"The worst time I've had with the app, is when I'm using a recipe and it just decides to refresh the page, moving back up to the top.  Incredibly frustrating when you're actively using it."
12057,12057,5,2017-04-12T23:00:12.000Z,Carmen10989,Great Recipe App!,"I just love Yummly because everything I've made using their recipes has come out delicious!  I love the vibrant pics, gives you an idea of how the food should look, but most of all I like that you get a different take on let's say chicken breasts... with so many different ways to prepare them, you don't get bored! You Yum what you love & have it for next time time or simply try a new recipe!  Yummly is absolutely Yummy!"
12058,12058,5,2017-06-28T20:00:32.000Z,Yuhh!,Easy and convenient,"Yummly, both website and app, is so easy to use. I love their design and the fact that they have images for each recipe, along with cook time and ingredient amount. The large variety of recipes allows for trials to find the perfect recipe for you, especially the ""nutrition label"" they have at the bottom of the recipe. It is an overall great app for food, drinks, and kitchen gadget recommendations."
12059,12059,4,2017-07-16T21:32:06.000Z,Mollymcq,Wide variety,"This is a good app to look up recipes by ingredients you have on hand. I wish all the recipes would include an easily printable version though. So many are blogs with all kinds of prose interspersed with pictures and I find it hard to scroll through all that while actually cooking. The ads can be annoying too. That said, I have discovered new dishes that I love and I like the fact that you can save Yums in categories such as dinner/sides/desserts, etc."
12060,12060,5,2014-05-18T17:37:54.000Z,Felxer45,Great app,"I use this app almost everyday. It's amazing how man recipes are out there that I could have never imagined. I am not one for cooking but when I do want to try something different, I got straight to yumm.  I love the fact that it has a shopping list for all of the ingredients needed to make that special dish. I'm so glad people come up with these wonderful ideas and some of these recipes are just flawless."
12061,12061,3,2014-09-15T19:34:21.000Z,Aprilbarista,Good app. One small issue.,"Over all, Yummly is a good app. Search results are usually relevant and I've found some new favorite recipes with its use. I would prefer, however, that all recipes opened in the device web browser. If the screen locks while you're in the middle of following a recipe it goes all the way back up to the top when you unlock. This can be annoying to have to scroll all the way back down to where you left off if you were near the end. overall, good. I enjoy the concept."
12062,12062,5,2014-10-06T16:14:13.000Z,HPJ7,Great App for your inner chef,I love this App. The App refreshes new menu options with inspired dishes you can store to individual lists or simply your favorites. You can also search for menu items too. Each dish you like comes from assorted cooking sites and come with directions to create your new found masterpiece and shopping list add-on options as well to make shopping for your new dishes ingredients a breeze.
12063,12063,4,2015-01-08T18:06:06.000Z,Note Dependent,Almost everything,I enjoy so much about this app. It's almost like playing a game just scrolling through the recipes and collecting the ones I like. Simply doing that is a great way to unwind for a couple of minutes.
12064,12064,4,2015-03-24T13:28:07.000Z,Camper mom of 4,Best recipe app I've found but.....,"This is the biggest variety and most extensive list of recipes I've found so far! My only complaint is that when I click on the directions, it redirects me to the apps page to try to get me to download an app that isn't even related! One recipe wouldn't even let me see the directions because it redirected me every time! Very frustrating. I tried about ten times and never got to see the directions so I gave up."
12065,12065,5,2015-05-25T23:09:11.000Z,Katherine178,Yummly review,"This app is great!!! I started using it on my computer and then realized they had an app for it.. The app works well for mad when I'm trying to plan a last minute dinner, or I'm in the grocery store trying to come up with something quick... I also love this app because it helps create a grocery list for all the the items that I will need to make each dish..."
12066,12066,5,2015-07-06T06:24:13.000Z,Bethanyyy87,Love!,"Love this app, has a ton of recipes to choose from! It's nice because they have a shopping list option so you can pick and choose which ingredients you need for your recipes. Once you go to the grocery store you can pull up what you need from this app. I've started cooking more recently and am not a pro but I've been able to find some yummy recipes that are easy to make!"
12067,12067,5,2015-07-08T22:34:21.000Z,wilmingtonfan,Love this app,This is a great app. I love the great recipes. They hit a lot of smaller sites with great recipes  I could never find all these recipes in my own. Shopping list feature is very helpful. Also it brings up recipes similar to others you like. Very intuitive. I love that you can ask for recipes matching your diet requirements or to avoid food allergies.  Wish it would expand this feature to include diabetic diets.
12068,12068,5,2016-12-04T17:31:18.000Z,Centralilskies,Good App - Basic to Gourmet,"I like this app because you can find anything from ""how to hardboil eggs"" to Pale to Vegan. You will have to look at the recipes and directions but the app makes this simple. I really like that it gathers all those food blogs and recipe sites into results so I don't have to go to individual sites but can look for a recipe at any pf them. Like the ""Yum"" feature so I can have my own electronic recipe files."
12069,12069,4,2017-08-04T01:04:40.000Z,Pcllarsen,Beautiful photos; amazing resource,"Aside from the amazingly beautiful photos, I really appreciate that I can sort, pick and choose recipes easily, and save them. The variety is nice too - easy recipes with few ingredients as well as multi-ingredient, complex recipes can be found."
12070,12070,5,2013-12-10T13:46:12.000Z,Bridgettearlee,Looks at a lot of sites,"Searches recipes from all over the web for you. Very easy to use and has a pleasant interface. Let's you save your favorite recipes and categorize them, also to create your own categories. Breaks recipes into ingredients and instructions so you can quickly review what you need without having to load entire directions page."
12071,12071,5,2014-11-18T15:27:53.000Z,MimiPawPaw,My go to for recipes,"Absolutely love this app!  It has become my new recipe book. I haven't found anything I don't like about it. Use it on my phone and iPad. Wish I could get it on my Kindle. When I'm in grocery , I can quickly look up items needed for fav recipe. I've been using it for a year and been meaning to write this review. Finding some gluten free options too which are convenient."
12072,12072,5,2015-05-10T01:05:08.000Z,hcgal2010,LOVE THIS APP,"This is a great app. Tons of recipes, very user friendly, and has great picture quality. Only thing I would change is how you view the actual recipe. It goes to the direct site which can sometimes be slow. It would be nice if it listed out the directions like the ingredients section but gave the link if the user wanted to access the site it originally came from."
12073,12073,5,2015-08-24T12:35:19.000Z,MaryPeterBen,Always my favorite app!!!,Tremendously beautiful and tremendously useful!  Check out the super fun way they figure out recipes you might be interested in.  They have ideas from everywhere...that you can add to you shopping list in a sec.  My sister lives in Nyc and does all grocery stuff through Yummly + InstaCart - when are you getting to jersey??  Off to cook something yummly...no tree nuts + pescatarian + kid-friendly + quick...bam!!
12074,12074,4,2015-12-06T15:45:20.000Z,Michellebayy,Good App - lots of variety,"I love the way you get to personalize it so it recommends recipes you're more likely to try. Only complaint would be that whenever I ""yum""/save a recipe, it won't show up in my saved recipes until I log out of my account and then log back in. So if I save a recipe for later today, I'd have trouble finding it. I'd have to log out/log in to refresh it. Other than that, I like it and will continue using it regularly."
12075,12075,4,2016-05-09T18:11:57.000Z,Orchdluvr,Good App,"I just recently started using this app. I've found some great recipes on it! I like that you can save favorites for later use and also the shopping list feature. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because I cannot seem to find recipes for small crockpots or small slow cookers. I have a 1.5 quart crockpot. So the recipes I've found, I have to try and reduce the quantities specified in the recipe, which doesn't work to good sometimes."
12076,12076,5,2016-06-15T13:38:40.000Z,victoriannee,"Easy to navigate, super convenient.","I have nothing but great experiences with Yummly. The shopping list feature is easy to use, and categorizes items for an efficient grocery store trip. Searching for the right recipe is simple with a variety of filters to choose from, including dietary preferences and cooking time. Seriously, it's the only app I'll ever need in the kitchen!"
12077,12077,5,2016-11-16T17:27:08.000Z,MrsAmareen,Great app,"I love this app and use it when ever I want to learn something new to cook... The only problem I have with it is that you can't save the videos of the recipes like you can save the other recipes. I seriously hope they change this so that you can add the videos to favorites as well, but other than that jst a test app to have. It's your own personal cook book but digital‚ò∫Ô∏è"
12078,12078,5,2017-01-15T17:04:14.000Z,baffle,Personalized recipe results,This app is a very useful tool that learns and predicts what recipes are right for you and gives you personalized suggestions. This is especially helpful considering they have something like two million recipes from almost every food site and blogger on the web. The beautiful pictures make it easy to choose which recipe you want to try.
12079,12079,5,2017-06-10T13:04:45.000Z,CAPITAINS,Yummly is amazing!,"This app is exactly what I hoped I would find. Even after filtering by many stringent dietary allergies and preferences, there is a very large range of recipes that tell you exactly how to make your dish, how long it will take, and the nutritional value. Loved it ever since I downloaded Yummly. Strives me to eat healthy and cook delicious without spending hours in the kitchen. Thank you for making my life easier. Excellent job!"
12080,12080,5,2013-11-21T22:23:40.000Z,MSAbdala,Comprehensive and user-friendly!,"Used this app to plan my meals over the weekend and it really helps to have a nonstop feed of recipe options with glossy photos from different sites. I have added a ton of new recipes to my collections, it's so addicting to browse all these recipes! Best part is the shopping list- you can text grocery lists to people and divide and conquer while you're shopping!"
12081,12081,4,2014-05-18T00:14:24.000Z,YourNicknameGumDrop,One improvement away from perfect..,"I would give this five stars BUT I wish it had categories!!! Like where we could click on a category [breakfast, lunch, dinner, appetizer, dessert, etc.] and it can bring up foods in there."
12082,12082,5,2014-07-22T15:22:19.000Z,sarra732,Perfect! Couldn't ask for more,"This app has wonderful recipes, with a clean, picture based interface. A must have for any aspiring cook or anyone looking to try something new now and then."
12083,12083,5,2014-08-14T22:46:44.000Z,Dirtbikingoddess,BEAUTIFUL food app!!,"I've had this app for a week and I cannot say enough about it. Beautiful pictures, easy to use, and layout is great! I was on this app for an hour going thru all the yummy recipes and saving my favorites to try and cook for my family. Luv how by each picture they have the calories, ingredients, and cook time. You have to get this app!!! It inspired me to cook more. (Which is a hard thing to do) haha :)"
12084,12084,4,2014-11-18T22:22:08.000Z,Kimbra Jean,Potential,I think the app has a lot of potential just that it hasn't reached the point where I'd stop using Pinterest for recipes. I tried using the booklet to add online recipes but I dislike that I can't add a photo with it. I also think it be cool to add favorite tastes and to be able to add/change a profile photo. The library of recipes will grow once adding online recipes becomes easier and with photos. Making it the ideal app for recipes.
12085,12085,5,2015-02-24T04:22:18.000Z,Barefootndirtyhaired,High Blood Pressure!,I found this app while looking for recipes to better suit my partner who recently found out he has high blood pressure. It worked so well for us and made it very easy to find tasty meals with significantly less sodium. I imagine it would work just as well for someone with a food allergy or specific eat restrictions. I honestly cannot believe the app is free. I would pay for this app it's great.
12086,12086,4,2015-03-15T18:34:37.000Z,MinnyLin,Love the app annoyed when it returns you to the beginning of the recipe,"I use this app all the time. It is my go-to for recipes. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because when my phone goes to sleep and I wake it back up, the app sends you back to the beginning of the recipe or blog. This gets annoying when you're trying to find the next step of a recipe and you have to scroll through a whole blog to find it."
12087,12087,5,2015-05-17T12:15:35.000Z,Alazdak,PheNOMenal!,"I absolutely love this app. I have significant restrictions on my diet, so the allergy and diet filters are wonderful for quickly finding exactly what you want or just browsing for new ideas and inspiration. I like the snapshot info they provide with each recipe before opening it up all the way up. Whether you're looking for indulgent, rich comfort food or low-cal, low-fat ways to experiment with flavor, Yummly delivers."
12088,12088,4,2015-08-29T12:32:08.000Z,Molly7101,Great replacement for Ziplist,"I was very very disappointed when the Ziplist platform was deactivated and not happy with their recommended replacement, Epicurious. I'm really happy with yummly and think with a few tweaks it could be five stars - better grocery list categories, and a way to save weekly menus would be great. I think the layout is pretty and I love that I can save recipes under multiple categories to make searching so easy. I use this app almost daily."
12089,12089,5,2016-11-11T05:24:43.000Z,Kinza Hagerup,Best thing ever,I love food and I love trying new things. Being able to browse through hundreds of thousands of options is greaat! There is nothing you cannot find a recipe to!! Also there are some great suggestions of recipes you should try and I have found many new favorites as well as upgrades from some dishes I have made in the past! Definitely a great app!!
12090,12090,5,2014-05-08T23:21:03.000Z,RenJennings,An Invaluable Resource,"Whether I am searching for a specific recipe or looking to be inspired, Yummly is my go-to app for all my foodie needs. The collections ensure I never lose track of a recipe and the shopping lists help tremendously in a pinch at the market. It's also great for picky eaters or those who may not be able to eat certain ingredients. This is by far the best recipe app out there- I would be a complete mess without it!"
12091,12091,4,2014-05-27T02:19:35.000Z,Dairi19,Suggestion for this lovely app,"First of all , i wanna say that this is probably the best recipe app out there. It has (most) of the stuff you need  to adjust it to what you really want. Awesome app!!!"
12092,12092,5,2014-12-15T23:42:27.000Z,Savannah270,I use this app all of the time!,"I love this app! Weather your searching for a recipe or just browsing, you will always find something you can make. I love how it's very easy to use and saves recipes you like by adding them to your yums. You can customize this app to send your liked recipes into the category of your choosing. This is my go to app when I want to bake something great."
12093,12093,5,2015-04-03T18:49:33.000Z,Saying it like it is,Perfect for vegans,"I recently made the lifestyle choice to become vegan. This app has made finding recipes so much easier. I'm glad this app pulls from all over the web to provide recipes, I've never felt limited. Plus the built in ingredients list with each recipe makes it so easy to compile a shopping list. I've used this app everyday since downloading it. Thank you so much!"
12094,12094,5,2015-05-31T14:44:19.000Z,KAB157,Love it,"This app is great! I have found so many amazing recipes, most of which seem almost hand crafted for me. This app does a great job building your profile and only showing you what you're interested in. Anyone that lives to cook and try new things should check this out. Anyone that wants good recipe ideas, even if you're a beginner, should check this out as well."
12095,12095,2,2015-12-01T22:39:09.000Z,hillrb01,Pretty But Unreliable,"I must start off my review by complimenting the look of the apps interface. Visually, it's enticing but after those bells and whistles subside, all you're left with is a tune of frustration. More times than not, when I have attempted to view the actual recipes in the app, I encounter the message ""Directions not available for this recipe."" It's great that there's a recipe for Moroccan style tabouleh but if I can't see it, then it's useless. With some bug fixes, this could be a superb app and I might be able to try that tabouleh without the help of Google next time."
12096,12096,4,2015-12-01T23:04:56.000Z,JBA2992,Great app with several flaws,"I love this app, but it does have bugs that have been around for quite some time."
12097,12097,4,2016-01-17T17:51:08.000Z,ruready4digital,Go-to App,"This app gives you plenty of options for what you're craving with associated blogs (if you're in to that), shopping list and easy to follow recipes ( even video assist). I prefer it not loose my place when I'm in the middle of following a recipe - but I'm sure they will fix that soon since many are commenting on that glitch. For me it's about the photos and tips and this app gives you ideas for the daily question: what's for dinner!"
12098,12098,5,2016-06-28T22:19:20.000Z,Dar313,Best recipe app,"I love this app. I am constantly trying to come up with creative new things to do in the kitchen, and this app is a great source of inspiration and recipes. I love the way it is set up and the easy of maneuverability. The pictures are clear and striking... In fact, as I sit there, sometimes for an hour or more, browsing recipes and scrolling around the site my wife teases me that I am surfing ""food porn""."
12099,12099,5,2017-01-10T22:31:12.000Z,dbnees,Love it,Yummly isn't your normal recipe app. It has links to an insane number of food web sites and blogs. Sometimes the ingredients show in the app aren't exactly the amounts in the recipe it links to buy that is rare. I like the ability to organize the recipes into categories and tha ability to make up my own categories. Plus putting the ingredients into one shopping list is sweet.
12100,12100,3,2013-12-19T20:58:20.000Z,Bigham315,One of the best food apps but needs improvements,"This is one of the best food apps out there and they have a lot of good content.  But as with all apps there are some things that would make this app even better. There needs to more ways to share to other people besides email and text. Their should also be a way to share to people using social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc. I will give it a five when they finally allow more sharing options"
12101,12101,5,2014-02-14T12:41:23.000Z,TriciaMN,I am cooking now!,"Love this app. It has such a great range of recipes. Even easy to find ideas for a restricted diet.  Its' shopping list feature is wonderful, as the main reason I haven't tried a lot of new recipes in the past is because I always forget to buy one or two of the ingredients... This makes it easy, even with two little kids in the shopping cart!"
12102,12102,4,2014-04-23T00:27:13.000Z,Mama's hungry,I wish another way to sign in,"I love all the options about this app except for the fact you HAVE to sign in with Facebook or email. I don't like it when the developers make it so your contacts or advertisement via Facebook  is the only way to sign in. It's a complete turn-off for me. But, other than that, it looks like it's well thought out. Please change so I can actually use it for my family. Thank you!:-)"
12103,12103,4,2014-05-12T20:32:44.000Z,Gymgirl810,Really enjoy!,"I have really enjoyed using this app. The ease of use and wide variety of recipes make this an app that I use fairly often. The only drawback that I have noticed is that my home page tends to keep popping up the same exact recipes time after time even after I continue to add more recipes. It would be nice to be able to refresh my feed and new recipes pop up each time. Other than that, I love this app."
12104,12104,5,2014-07-27T16:39:49.000Z,Ms Place,This is the one,"This is the one everyone has been looking and hoping for. One Place to research recipes from many, many sites -- and the One Place to store them all in, yes, One Place. Unlike many others, this app is highly searchable, recipes can be edited and modified, it's scalable, and nutrition information is included! Nothing else comes close to this -- this is the One app to use."
12105,12105,5,2014-11-21T23:01:02.000Z,DreaJones,LOVE THIS APP!!,I really love cooking and making up things putting my own spin to it and this app is a Great CookBook on the go or at 3am when snack time Attacks. The fact that it helps you make a grocery list of things for certain recipes and can add whatever you think you need to that list I looooove this Yummly App sooo much! I recommend this to the chef at heart the beginners ;) you definitely have a helping hand and it's FREE!!
12106,12106,5,2015-09-10T01:04:07.000Z,S. Vance,Life changing!,"This app has allowed me to actually make a lot of good decisions with my eating and even spending habits. Knowing all of these wonderful recipe ideas has inspired me to cook and create more things instead of just eating out all the time. The filters for food preferences as well as allergies, provide a wonderful array of options despite those said preferences. Definitely recommend!"
12107,12107,3,2016-01-16T16:01:06.000Z,Bottlegirl,Love the app but can be very frustrating,"You are able to find recipes you like and put them in in an area that says ""My Yums"". When you go into your Yums, it will tell you have so many are stored in there, like maybe 30. But when you tap on that area, only 21 of them will come up and you have to do a lot of messing with the app for the rest of them to pop up. Love the app otherwise, but very frustrating when I try to go back and find the recipes I want to make!!"
12108,12108,5,2016-02-27T18:51:00.000Z,Hilariousk,Yummly is my favorite,"If I have no idea what to cook, or bake, or make, Yummly always works. I can find any recipe to follow by just typing in the ingredients I already have at home.  I like the nutrition information and the filters especially. The app's interface is also very user friendly, soft, and intuitive. The colors and logo are appealing. It's evident that a lot of work went into creating this app."
12109,12109,5,2016-06-14T18:40:47.000Z,Kiwii<3,Super awesome!!,"This app is so helpful! It lets you pick out a palette and dietary restrictions and then gives recipe suggestions according to them. You can also turn the restrictions or certain flavors on/off when needed, so it's been super great for days when I want to eat healthy, plant based meals, but also on days when I just want some meaty comfort food. A great app overall. Also great organization."
12110,12110,5,2014-03-01T23:09:03.000Z,"Amber ""foodie""",Incredible and helpful,Cooking is one of my favorite things to do. This app seems to work flawlessly. It is amazing that it gets to know you and suggests recipes according to preference. Every suggestion so far is spot on and sounds very tasty. I love the way you can mark what you would like to make and can add to the shopping list accordingly. Every foodie and/or aspiring chief should get this app. Perfect.
12111,12111,5,2014-11-30T00:15:54.000Z,Naner727,Too legit to quit,"I don't usually write reviews on apps, but this app is awesome.  Almost everything I've cooked using this app has been delicious.  It's super easy to use and has more recipes than you can shake a stick at.  Anytime I have a hankering for something, I just type in what I'm looking for and there is always a wide variety of things to choose from.  Well done Yummly, well done."
12112,12112,5,2015-04-20T04:23:52.000Z,Peter16789,My new Fav,"You can do so much with this app. You can search for recipes, filter results based on lot of things and save recipes into different buckets. I loved the ability to create shopping list. You also have an option of getting them delivered via instacart. Love the new design changes around personalization. Yummly has become my goto app for anything cooking related"
12113,12113,5,2015-04-26T01:48:48.000Z,Calee19,The app I have wanted forever!!,"I have 4 little kids and cook for them and my husband almost every meal. I go grocery shopping once a week on Sunday and do not go back with 4 kids in tow if I forget something. This app is so well designed, visually stunning, and useful! I would pay for this app and with my husband being an app developer, this says a lot. Well done Yummly!!! Thank you!"
12114,12114,5,2015-05-19T17:39:24.000Z,Viicetm,I don't always rate apps,"But when I do, they have to be as awesome as this one."
12115,12115,5,2015-05-25T16:33:22.000Z,chillingin2010,Amazing!,"I am in love with this app! Not only does it offer amazing recipes from basically every food blog possible, but it also allows you to add the ingredients directly to your shopping list. The fact you can also receive recipes based off your likes/dislikes is fantastic. It is so personalized. It is like a little, endless book of recipes right at the tip of my fingers!"
12116,12116,2,2015-06-07T02:20:36.000Z,jdtwig,Great but . . .,"Love this app, really helps in adding variety to my meal planning.  Great photos.  Too bad I can only use about 1 in 5 recipes as I always get error message when looking at the directions.  I can always see the ingredients.  Either the directions won't pull up at all or right in the middle of making something the directions say error in the kitchen and disappear.  This started happening with the last version update.  I now make a note of where the recipes are found so I can go there directly.  Very annoying."
12117,12117,5,2016-02-24T17:57:25.000Z,Miss Keri Baby,Love this App!,It's like a Facebook or Pintrest for FOOD! I like to eat clean so it hard finding recipes on the other apps that work for me and my family. But this one does the trick! When you sign up you select foods that interest you and waalaa! - it updates with recipes that fits you! I found and tried countless recipes from here that have been a BIG HIT with my husband and daughter.
12118,12118,5,2016-04-01T18:27:36.000Z,Smithhr3,I use this app everyday!,"I absolutely love this app. Not only does it have such a large variety of delicious recipes to choose from, I love how you can sort the recipes and create new categories personalized to you. I made a ""Already Tried"" and a ""New Recipes"" section myself, and it helps me stay organized. I use this app everyday and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
12119,12119,5,2017-01-08T18:22:42.000Z,HappyUser10717,LOVE this app,"This is probably the only lifestyle app that I am constantly going back to you. I love everything about it ‚Äì the clean user experience, how are you can pull together all of the ingredients you need into a segmented grocery list, and the consistent quality of the recipes that I try through this app. It's the only app that I recommended to my family and friends."
12120,12120,5,2014-02-10T16:02:50.000Z,BelliveauK,Amazing!!,"This app is awesome! You can save recipes, change serving size, and add ingredients to the shopping list. The ingredients on the shopping list are categorized by type of food and you can check off each item as you get them. This is exactly the kind of app I have been looking for!! Definitely recommend trying it out for yourself..you will love it!!"
12121,12121,5,2014-08-01T06:18:42.000Z,Hasanul Karim,Just awesome!!!,This app is great! Got so many recipes and of so many cuisines. So far tried 4 items and all of them were great. I am a newbie at cooking and this is the first app that is inspiring me to cook more! I love the way it's organized. Just one thought: it would be better if there were photos of the ingredients or a link to google search from the app. Other than that I am loving it.
12122,12122,5,2014-11-13T14:10:57.000Z,K8erleens,Best Recipe App!,I love this app! Every time I've needed a recipe this has suggested multiple ones that I would have loved to use. The down side is having to choose! It makes it easy to find just the right recipe to fit what you have in your cupboards or what you can substitute if you're missing something. Everyone who loves to cook and try new things should have this app!
12123,12123,5,2015-03-22T17:04:27.000Z,Ryno Lee,Needs better syncing,"Great app - I love the layout but the syncing of lists between iOS devices is inconsistent at best. My wife and I are constantly trying to reconcile our lists as they drop out of sync or don't sync at all, requiring one of us to sign out (list is deleted) sign back in and re-input our list. The rest of the app for food suggestions is quite helpful."
12124,12124,5,2015-09-25T03:39:47.000Z,karishines123,Love,"There isn't a day that goes by that I don't open this app. I use it everyday and it's amazing. Out of all the cooking apps out there, this is the one I rely on. You can change the serving sizes and it will adjust all the ingredients accordingly. That has to be my favorite part. That and all the amazing recipes! I'm vegetarian and this app still works surprisingly well for me. Thank you Yummly!! I love you."
12125,12125,5,2015-11-14T22:08:13.000Z,KatycatForever,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I love using this app on a daily basis. I always discover new, delicious recipes that I can't wait to try, and all the recipes so far have been delicious. Being able to organize your food into different categories (lunch, dinner, etc.) and being able to create your own category makes recipes very easy to find. I rarely review apps, but this one was worth writing a review for."
12126,12126,5,2015-12-04T22:28:59.000Z,EpicurianChef,Diverse Compilation of recipes!,"I love this app. It combines Pinterest, every food blog you've ever heard of, as well as HomeCooking and All Recipes, and Food Network. You're not going to find more recipes or a better, more diverse compilation of recipes anywhere else on the Internet. Plus there's that nifty 'shopping cart' so you can remind yourself what you need for the recipe! Two thumbs up, 5 stars, love this app."
12127,12127,4,2016-04-29T02:25:41.000Z,Dailesu,Great app now even better!,"I like the collection of recipes available, I've found some really delicious ones that are now regulars in my repertoire.  It used to be that when I'd save new recipes to my collection, they wouldn't always show up in my list and some recipes that I deleted (tried them & didn't like) would still be there.  Haven't had that problem lately so they must have fixed it."
12128,12128,5,2016-10-24T01:50:07.000Z,Jilllery,My go-to food app,"I love this app! Not only are there a million delicious recipes to choose from, but it makes meal planning a breeze! I previously was using this app just to discover and cook recipes with 1000+ likes.  Recently I started using the 'shopping list' feature I can plan my weeknight meals within seconds, purchase all the ingredients needed, and waste less food."
12129,12129,3,2017-07-17T00:08:33.000Z,DeanaSchott,Too much advertising,"Used to absolutely love this app because you could put down you're eating criteria and it would find to recipes to fit your lifestyle. However, recently I've noticed that when you try to read a recipe you are sent to another website and many times there's all kinds of advertising that inhibits you're being able to read it from your phone. Very irritating. I give it three stars because it used to be very good."
12130,12130,5,2013-11-30T15:43:53.000Z,Jessbkuz,Get This!,"A hand full of days before the Thanksgiving Chaos, I got this and a few other apps to keep my mind organized.  The other apps didn't even come close to what Yum did.  I'm always losing or forgetting lists of items I need from the grocery store and what recipes goto what.  This will definitely take care of any scatter brain mother's out there with a crap ton to do."
12131,12131,5,2014-10-02T22:33:14.000Z,Alexisp0p91,My number 1 app to figure out dinner,"The part that totally won me over is the fact that I can search for a meal just by typing in one or two ingredients, for example ""spinach and ziti"", and up comes a plethora of recipes involving those ingredients, and they're all to-die-for recipes. I have raved and ranted to my friends about this app and I figured it's about time to give my 5 star review!"
12132,12132,5,2014-10-29T19:20:30.000Z,Tour de pants,My one stop planning tool,"I've used other services like this app years ago to plan out my weekly menus, but they didn't conform to new technology and are annoying to use. I love this app and use it a lot. It has great sharing capabilities on platforms like Pinterest, which other style apps do not. I also like that it pulls from all over and is a database of blogs and websites."
12133,12133,2,2014-12-06T23:30:05.000Z,babbott40,Too much screen clutter,"This app looks beautiful until you actually click on a recipe.  As you scroll through the directions it is covered by a bar at the top of the screen, a bar at the top of the screen, a share bar that you can expand, but not get rid of, and an arrow to quickly scroll to the top.  If that wasn't enough, if you stop to read something an ad pops up at the bottom to block another portion of the screen.  It is a terrible use of screen real estate, and too annoying for me to use."
12134,12134,3,2015-01-26T23:08:07.000Z,Very unhappy with this,Just OK,"Good concept with grocery list etc. totally agree with review #4. I put in my likes, dislikes app tends to ignore. I continually get things pick for ""me"" on my dislike list."
12135,12135,5,2015-06-02T03:36:26.000Z,Nomsters,Exactly what I've been looking for!,"this app is amazing for me not only because I love to cook because I've also been trying to eat healthier lately. It has designed special recipes to help with my needs, foods that I hate, and my allergies. I think this is the most GENIUS APP EVER and I rarely give out reviews but I loved this app so much I had to rate it!! Besides its a free app, what are you missing out on!?"
12136,12136,5,2015-12-07T18:36:28.000Z,Lucky13lms,Easy and convenient,"I have been using the app for a while now. Saving recipes I like, adding them to my own categories under my yums. Now, I can create a shopping list from selected recipes, have those items added to Instacart, place the order and have them delivered within two hours."
12137,12137,5,2016-04-03T13:36:23.000Z,Loops17,Best food app,"I've been using this app now for over a year and I feel it is the best one out there due to its ease of use speed, efficiency and just sheer volume of available recipes.  Also, added features such as being able to save (Yum) recipes and add a grocery list are fantastic features."
12138,12138,5,2016-04-03T19:06:24.000Z,Vance124,LOVE IT!,All the recipes at one place. Yummly  searches the web for the best recipes around the globe and makes them convenient for you. You can find anything for anytime. Additionally they have a shopping list you can use to make sure you get all your ingredients! I use this App all the time and the variety of recipes makes my friends jealous. The BEST of Food Search in YUMMLY! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
12139,12139,4,2016-04-09T00:24:34.000Z,CopJade,Absolute Must Have Food App,My family have enjoyed many different recipes from breakfast to dinner. Now that my wife and I are dieting we can find things to fix for dinner that even our children enjoy. The recipes are easy to follow and the ingredients are easy to find at many grocery stores. Rather you want something to cook in a crockpot for hours or something to make in an hour this is the app for you.
12140,12140,4,2014-03-16T14:00:37.000Z,Dillon Z.,Good app BUT,"I love your guys website and the app is useful but sometimes I prefer the website because you can't do the search with ""included ingredient"" but every freakin time I go to your website all you do I spam your app and the banner that covers the entire window can't go away. The ""x"" button isn't even a link it's just for show please stop spamming your app on the website or fix the button"
12141,12141,5,2014-03-31T04:04:40.000Z,muppetlibrarian,Great app for finding healthy recipes,I am vegan and try to eat healthy food.  This app is great for finding new recipes.  If you create a profile you can select your diet and the app will filter out recipes that aren't on your diet.
12142,12142,5,2014-10-03T19:56:57.000Z,Meggycole,Love it but I have one request...,"I absolutely love this app! However, one thing I think would be nice would be to have the feature of making notes on recipes. I made a recipe or two on here and made adjustments with each that I'm afraid I'll forget the next time I make them. If the app had that feature it would make it even better!"
12143,12143,5,2015-10-20T19:01:50.000Z,guitarman1208,Should have been 5 stars,"I have used this app for a long time now. Love the preferences section and the personal library.  Now that it keeps crashing every time I back out I must say,....I expected better work from you folks. Bring the old version back if you have too or I will have to switch apps, and we don't want me to do that."
12144,12144,5,2016-02-22T22:46:21.000Z,Anonycook,Best food app,"Best food app. Allows you to filter food to exactly what you like. Has endless recipes and with detailed instructions. People will think u know how to cook. One cool add on or fix which I know would be too much but it'd help. Is that It should give alternatives to ingredients, like generic brand of an ingredient or any other brand to ur shopping list or whatever. Either way, great app!"
12145,12145,5,2017-01-20T03:05:15.000Z,Old mom of 4,Get rid of the adds - please!,I've never written a review of an app before but an doing it now because of how useful I have found it so quickly.  The only thing I don't like are the adds. As I'm scrolling through the directions I keep touching the adds.  I'd happily pay to be rid of them. A one time fee a monthly fee.  Done. I'm there.  Those adds drive me nuts!!!!!
12146,12146,5,2017-02-12T15:27:27.000Z,ShellBstyles,Great Recipe Selection!,"I enjoy being able to find ideas and recipes quickly through this app. You can filter the selection by your dietary preferences, so your not seeing options that don't work for you. I've tried a quite few recipes and they were all relatively easy to make and delicious. Great way to insert newness into your weekly meals."
12147,12147,5,2017-02-26T19:08:16.000Z,Funatic03,Plethora of recipes & User Friendly,"I use this app on the regular and have turned many friends on to it. Totally comprehensive. You can literally type in anything- as broad or specific as you wish and find tons of recipes with multiple variations. It's a staple. As long as this app exists, I don't really need anything else! Highly recommended is an understatement. üëçüèΩ"
12148,12148,5,2017-06-10T13:18:53.000Z,PBA Student,Great for beginners,"I LOVE this app! I love the shopping list feature. It is super helpful when picking stuff out at the store. You are not scrolling through the directions and mentally checking of the items. The app does the work for you. I am also SUPER looking forward to when their new partner, InstaCart comes to West Palm Beach, FL. I will definitely use that delivery feature all the time."
12149,12149,5,2017-07-04T11:14:55.000Z,bri-der,Favorite cooking app,"Beside my Betty Crocker cookbook, I use the Yummly app for a good portion of my cooking inspiration. I cannot remember how I found this app, but I am glad that I came across it about 2 1/2 years ago.  I use the Yummly app often in my home because I love to try new dishes. There are a variety of easy to follow recipes to choose from for any given occasion. This app is by far my favorite cooking app."
12150,12150,4,2013-11-27T05:18:30.000Z,Davisj80,Love nutrition facts,"I love this app and scrolling through all of the delicious photos. Getting all of the ingredients, nutrition facts and directions at my fingers makes it easy to know what's good."
12151,12151,5,2014-01-19T02:39:48.000Z,tabbielynnlove,Can't get enough of this app!,"Super user friendly and easy to understand! The recipes are affordable, even on a starving college student fund. Shopping is much easier with the shopping list option. The only change I would like to see is the option to filter ingredients by more allergies, not just typical allergens (like cinnamon!)"
12152,12152,5,2014-07-07T23:30:42.000Z,Lyricocean1223,LOVE LOVE LOVE!,"Im not one to leave these reviews but I really feel this one is an exception! I LOVE this app! It's been a critical piece to my meal planning and even to my diet changes as it's so easy to search for recipes that are low cal and low fat without weeding through the delish and tempting richer meals. Aside from a few glitches here and there, it's perfect! The shopping list is the best feature! It very well thought out! Ty!!!!"
12153,12153,5,2015-01-16T00:51:30.000Z,Jc panther,Best food app!!,"I have used multiple food apps and they have all been missing some part of the equation for me each time. This app does it all and every recipe I've made so far has been awesome. The shopping cart is perfect. Nutrition facts is useful, and the serving size that you can adjust and it automatically adjusts ingredients is super convenient!!! Best app I have for sure..."
12154,12154,5,2015-03-01T17:02:38.000Z,Beelizcee,Love it - but let me write notes!,Great app - perfect for those that love to cook and those who want to have last minute inspiration. The ability to search the app and also add new recipes from the web is great. Only complaint is that I would love a notes option for each specific recipe to keep track of different cook times/recipe tweaks/etc.
12155,12155,5,2015-03-26T23:12:27.000Z,Kendel94,LOVE this app!,"The concept of this app is to die for and its so easy to use. I love that it crowdsources great recipes from all over the Internet, puts them in one place, and then allows me to seamlessly add ingredients I may need to complete the recipe to my shopping list with a simple tap. The only thing that could make this better is adding more sources from other popular food blogs."
12156,12156,4,2015-04-28T18:54:24.000Z,Beccaudrey,Love it!! Lots of gluten free options.,"I love this app. It is so versatile! I recently found out I have a gluten intolerance and the idea of planning meals for myself and my ultra runner husband (who needs a high carb diet), and have it be gluten free seemed daunting! But once I edited my filter to show only gluten free recipes I realized how easy it really is! I didn't give this app 5 stars because some of the gluten free recipes actually are not! I always have to read the recipes very closely."
12157,12157,4,2015-06-07T13:17:49.000Z,Victor Sobrado,"Excellent App, but could use some fine-tuning.","The app overall offers a wide selection of recipes and a good amount of search filters. The shopping list is probably the most annoying feature. As you're checking off items you already own, the app decides to re-sort the items in the list and you start to click on items you didn't intend to. WHYYYY."
12158,12158,3,2015-11-30T22:10:07.000Z,sciguy0504,Nice but a few bugs,"Overall, this is a great app but there are a few serious issues. First, I have ""yummed ten recipes but only five show. I have no idea how to go back and see the others. Second, whenever you want to add a quantity of an item in your shopping list the quantity box quickly disappears and you have to start over again. Third, the app keeps requesting a review even if you hit ""no thanks."" I hope they fix these problems soon."
12159,12159,5,2017-06-21T15:14:30.000Z,Helen. P,Delightful recipes!,This is the first sight I always go to when I'm looking up a recipe. Sometimes after reading further I discover that I would rather make something different and it has never failed me it is delicious. I think all of you who have sent in recipes in addition to giving the nutrients and calorie count it is amazing thank you.
12160,12160,2,2014-02-24T16:24:51.000Z,I don't want men's clothing!,Server is always down/need food cats added..vegan/vegetarians,"I take my iPad everywhere, and every time I try to access, search, or add it says ""there's trouble in the kitchen, our server should be up shortly"" or something to that effect. Am I ever going to be able to use this?! Also, it would be helpful to have food categories added for people with gluten allergies, or vegetarian, vegan etc. my mother is vegan and I thought this would be helpful in finding something to cook for her while she comes to stay with me. Might be deleting."
12161,12161,5,2014-11-11T19:26:37.000Z,Elizabeth Bergman,A Wonderful Discovery,"When I came across the Yummly app I was skeptical. I don't download apps very often, so I was a bit hesitant. Once I had browsed it's contents, however, I was overjoyed!! I have already used many recipes that I've found on Yummly, and am planning to use many more! The organization part, when you save a recipe, is very nice. All of the drink/snack/dinner recipes are Amazing!!"
12162,12162,5,2014-12-14T19:22:32.000Z,MrChurros001,It is the best !,"It is an app with a great interface and the pictures are extremely attractive and make you want to cook! My friend and I made cookies and we had barely cooked before but thanks to the precise instructions from yummly everything went fluidly and easily. The instructions are clear and simple , really recommend this app to amateur cookers it is a great application!"
12163,12163,5,2015-10-28T12:43:17.000Z,Zzinger0216,Love but keeps shutting down,This is my favorite recipe app and the only one I have but it has been acting up recently. I go to look at a recipe and when I want to go back it completely closes the app on me and I have to restart it. Please fix this problem. I want to keep this app on my phone but if you can't fix it I'm forced to find a new recipe app üòï
12164,12164,5,2015-11-19T01:21:15.000Z,HelloMJL,Excellent!,"I have used this app multiple times to find and make delicious meals! My only criticism would be that when I have a recipe open in my phone and I am idle for awhile, when I click on the app again it doesn't stay on the recipe and I must find the recipe again. Other than that, great app, great recipes, delicious food, and emails are great too! Thanks yummly!"
12165,12165,1,2015-12-09T21:47:13.000Z,X<O>X,Annoying!,"I find this app, and their website, terribly annoying."
12166,12166,1,2016-01-05T02:22:30.000Z,Halp me darlin,Update blows!,"I have loved this app ever since I discovered it. The newest update, however, has some major flaws. I'm unable to see my recent ""yummed"" recipes in my lists! They are nowhere to be found. Also, I'm not getting nearly as many recipe recommendations as I did with the old version! It seems to be the same 20 or so recipes it's showing me, when it used to be new ones every time I refreshed. I have also lost all my saved recipes twice now...over 300 recipes each time! It doesn't recognize my email login anymore for some frustrating reason!! Please fix!!!"
12167,12167,4,2016-01-23T01:08:52.000Z,Maryo Kart,Great App but...,"I love this app! However, I'm very disappointed that there is no way for me to make notes attached to the recipes, or change the ingredients to fit what I actually used in the recipe. This is a good app but I cruder this lack of modification range a major flaw. I'm not going to remember what modifications I used, and it's a hassle for me to store the recipe somewhere else in my phone when I already have a space dedicated to recipes."
12168,12168,5,2016-02-17T16:25:28.000Z,CMDNJ80,Great app!,"Was using tastebook until they shut down the recipe section. This is heads and tails above tastebook. Only slight downside is the ability to edit a recipe that you bring into your recipe box. It locks it so that it can't be edited. You can always type in the recipe manually and adjust it however you want, but that's more work. All-in though this app is awesome."
12169,12169,5,2017-06-18T23:58:51.000Z,stephyb0913,Amazing for beginners!!,I honestly have to save this app saved my life lol. It's helped me learn how to cook such a wide variety of dishes healthy and not so healthy with step by step directions and such great pictures even has ingredients list too! I love the dinner time you can add as a reminder to cook that dish. I use it all the time and have gotten a lot better in my cooking so thank you :)
12170,12170,4,2013-10-12T12:16:48.000Z,My days is my fav,Fantastic app!!,"This app is great. I have found recipes on here that I have been trying to find for years and some of them are actually healthy while being comfort food!!! My only suggestion is they fix the ingredient list, if the name is long the text goes off the screen and it's hard to tell what they are asking for. Wrap around text or scrolling text should be used instead."
12171,12171,4,2015-07-20T03:32:45.000Z,Soonergirlhk,Amazing!,"The only thing holding me back from giving this app 5 stars is there isn't a discover feature. You can search and that aspect works extremely well, but I can't just open a tab and click dinner ideas. That is, if there is a way, I haven't found it. Other than that, I love it. I've used it and I've been told by my family that I am not allowed to stop cooking."
12172,12172,2,2015-08-17T12:28:46.000Z,Roneless,Where is the meat,"I downloaded this and thought it would be handy. I went through the settings and indicated that I eat meat. I also specified the cuisine that I liked, such as Asian, Chinese, Thai, and Japanese.  But as I started to browse the suggested recipes I noticed none included meet and very few were Asian cuisine.  So I did a ""meat count"". That is, i counted the number of recipes in the first 50 suggested recipes that included meat as an ingredient. Zero included meat. I came to the conclusion that the app is either not using my settings or it has mostly vegan recipes."
12173,12173,5,2015-11-09T02:38:59.000Z,Vettechapril,Perfect!,"This is hands down the best recipe app out there. It allows you to set filters according to allergies and specific undesired foods, so when you do a search, recipes you can actually use pop up for you. This has been wonderful for me and my son, since we both suffer from celiac disease. Thank you to the fantastic people who came up with this app!"
12174,12174,5,2015-12-06T12:47:37.000Z,bs8140,Awesome!!,"I love love love this app! I am always looking for new and healthy recipes and always find it here! It's extremely helpful also because it not only gives you places near you where you can find ingredients cheaper, but the nutritional values as well! My husband is diabetic, so being able to know what the carbs are is very important to me! Thank you!!"
12175,12175,5,2015-12-08T08:25:30.000Z,Itshellosydney,Amazing,I absolutely love it. I have a strict diet and this app has such a variety and it let me completely customize the diet that I have. There were so many options and it just really made me happy. I also love that you can favorite and send the ingredients to a list. Its such an organized and customizable app which is something I can really appreciate.
12176,12176,5,2015-12-13T13:07:52.000Z,Apple Up,"Awesome App, Awesome Recipes",A must have app for all occasions and cooking. Love the shopping list. You can check off what you already have. Also can text to my hubby so he can get exactly what we need. Another cool feature of shopping list is that it suggests what section it's in for quicker navigation around the store. Love this app! I'm totally starting to love cooking / baking now!!
12177,12177,5,2016-04-18T15:11:05.000Z,Altimatinfiniti,What an amazing app!,Been using this app for about six months now and I love it. Changed our eating habits and cooking habits. Learning new stuff everyday and new food. Easy to use and is usually very accurate. Must have app for all your cooking needs. Apple Watch portion is also very nice. So easy to just look at the what's recommend on my watch. So awesome! Much needed.
12178,12178,4,2016-09-21T16:54:58.000Z,LuckyNumberC,Incredibly useful!,I could use so many food puns to describe how deliciously useful this app can be. But... I don't feel the knead to do so.
12179,12179,5,2017-01-08T15:20:49.000Z,Chopswife,My #1 Go To Recipe App. Love It!,"It love this app. It have found so many delicious recipes on Yummly. My son's friends, my my daughter, son in law, and grandkids LOVE the recipes that I have made from Yummly. It is my go to app when I am looking for something new to make! I have gotten so many people to download this app because they enjoyed the meals and/ or desserts I have made from the recipes I tried on Yummly."
12180,12180,5,2014-02-25T15:50:35.000Z,Little Yellow One,Love it!,I've tried a bunch of different cooking and recipe apps and ended up deleting all of them. I love this one! And I never write reviews so it must be good! I love the big pictures of the food so I know what I'm trying to make and the fact that I can sort by meal. It's also a huge plus that I can make my shopping list straight from the meals I want to cook. <3 it!!!
12181,12181,4,2014-03-05T17:06:09.000Z,CartoonGirl,Clean design = most useful recipe app ever,"The design is clean and the response is snappy. Easy to like, save and organize recipes from all over the web. The shopping list is easy though a bit in accurate as a few times I had to refer to the recipe to get the correct amount of what I needed. Still, easy to go back and forth in between. Can only see improvement for this app. Love it."
12182,12182,5,2014-05-11T13:16:35.000Z,Kitchen Addiction,Simply awesome.,"Love the range of recipes, and the fact that I can do a quick view of just the ingredients without having to scroll through any kitchen blogs to find it. The nutritional info upfront is also a plus. I've managed to find the inspiration to hide a lot of veggies in my sons food thanks to ideas I found through recipes on this app."
12183,12183,4,2014-06-16T14:46:19.000Z,David Black,Good app,"This app is a great idea and runs well. I'm not a big fan of introducing sponsored recipes, but I get that you have to make money somehow. I also don't particularly like that after you choose a recipe for a particular dish all the other recipes for that same dish show up on your home screen. If I found a great recipe for chiles rellenos I don't need any more so it seems a bit redundant to have them on my home screen."
12184,12184,5,2014-11-27T15:41:41.000Z,Afiorett,Love to Cook? Then get this app!,"I love having Yummly update me on recommended recipes. Some of the best recipes I've tried recently have come from Yummly. It's a well-written app, too. Yummly makes it convenient to keep track of recipes I want to try later, without having to attempt to save the webpage or email the link to myself. Hands down, one of my favorite apps."
12185,12185,4,2014-12-26T18:43:16.000Z,Elda Franklin,Great app!,"I really love the Yummly app because not only is it a great collection of recipes for every occasion, every recipe I've tried has been easy to follow and results are always excellent. The only problem I have is that I wish there were a more direct way to print out the recipe. Navigation is not as user-friendly as it could be for printing recipes. Otherwise, I love it, and it saves me a lot of meal planning time."
12186,12186,5,2015-05-14T21:51:24.000Z,Charity with Love,Cooking Inspirations,"I love Yummly because it offers dietary preferences and adapts to personal tastes. Yummly has inspired me to become more innovative and creative. I have some basic principles from Alice Waters and Moosewood Cookbook, but Yummly has taken my cooking to a whole different level. I deleted all the other recipe apps a couple years ago, this one, by far, trumps them all and I am keeping it."
12187,12187,5,2016-07-25T03:45:54.000Z,A Austin,I LOVE this app!!!!,"I use Yummly for cool new recipes all the time. I love that it now has the break down of nutrition information for each recipe as well. I would love to see links for stores that carry the ingredients at the most competitive prices near me. So perhaps a geo-feature would be helpful to know where to pick up these items. Otherwise, it's great!!"
12188,12188,4,2017-02-04T23:07:55.000Z,Steenie7,Love new recipes,"Love to try new recipes so when I hear of something new on the Cooking channel or try something new in a restaurant I log on to Yummly and find the recipe. Sometimes I just search for new ways to prepare an old standard like Chicken or short ribs.  Love not having to print anything and just being able to grab my phone and log on to Yummly while in the kitchen. Great App, couldn't live without it."
12189,12189,5,2017-05-23T01:19:52.000Z,Dandilauren1210,Best food app ever,"This is easily my favorite app I have had on my phone for a few years now. The organization, aesthetic, and amount of things you can find on it is endless. I use it every time I can't think of something to make or just for some new food/drinks to try making to change it up a little!"
12190,12190,5,2014-02-23T21:32:50.000Z,Maripeazzy,Fun and easy!,This app has it all! From fun and easy healthy eating recipes to my yummy indulgence desserts and cheesy favorites! It's very continent to simply type in the ingredient I'm looking for and Yummly suggests a variation of different dishes! Also my friend is vegan so whenever she comes over or we plan a cooking day we go to Yummly bc it has an array or recipes for any specific diet! Love it and highly recommend!
12191,12191,5,2014-07-17T02:23:44.000Z,LawrinBrittany,Seriously my favorite app of all time!!!!,"I LOVE THIS APP!!!!! Even when I'm bored I can go on this app and be inspired. Anything that I'm interested in finding a recipe for, this app has it! I've been a cooking fool ever since I downloaded this app and myself and my family could not be happier. So much fun to try new things and the app is super easy to navigate. I recommend to EVERYONE and anyone!!!"
12192,12192,5,2014-09-19T22:47:58.000Z,Kresley Cole,A pretty sweet app,"Great faceted searching to find exactly what you want. I do wish there was an option to search by vegetable, though. I love that you can save a recipe and then add the ingredients to a shopping list. You do need to be connected to the internet to see the recipe because it links to its online source."
12193,12193,5,2014-11-22T20:35:35.000Z,rmcbeath,Beautiful App Design,"The design of this app is amazing--it's worth it just for this. Scrolling through beautiful pictures of food has never been easier. They also have great filtering options, so you can browse items that have low carb servings, low spicy, filter by vegan diets, and indicate ingredients that you don't like."
12194,12194,5,2015-02-23T11:26:30.000Z,Trail horse challenger,Custom categories and shopping lists!,"Solves my ""I don't know what to make for ... "" dilemma!  Easily browse tons of great recipes and save in one or more categories I've created. Then I just go to a recipe I've stored and tell Yummly to create a shopping list, and off I go!  The list even sorts ingredients by store section and I can mark items off as they go into the cart. Great app!"
12195,12195,5,2015-08-29T20:17:49.000Z,TweetAlice,Terrific!,"If you're looking for something special -- look no further. You'll find it (or more likely a dozen ""its"") right in Yummly.  Delicious recipes, often quite simple, and usually with ingredients you have on hand. I've recommended this app quite often since I downloaded it, and have received comments like the one I wrote here. Enjoy!"
12196,12196,4,2015-10-11T01:15:37.000Z,ekw06001,Love but need a few tweaks,I really really love all the recipes that this app has and I like that it shows new ones every time based on my preferences. The only negative for me is all my yums don't show when I try to look at them. Only half are listed but I know they are still there because they will show up when I use the search bar. If this was fixed it would be perfect!
12197,12197,5,2016-03-01T21:45:03.000Z,LatinaBella,MUST HAVE APP!!,This app is awesome for those who are venturing out and trying to learn how to cook basics and new things. We have discovered so many recipes that my family loves!! And I LOVE that is has a shopping list feature that allows you to quickly add items for a recipe to a grocery shopping list. best app ever! One of top two favorite apps tied with Pinterest! üíóüíóüíó yummy Yummly!! üíóüíóüíó
12198,12198,5,2016-04-10T16:11:35.000Z,Vie runner,Yummly every week,I use Yummly every week to plan my meals for the week and I love it!  There are so many great recipes and I have only scratched the surface of what is provided. It is easy to search for anything in all recipes or just what I have saved. I especially like that I can create my own categories and search for what I am looking for in each.
12199,12199,5,2016-05-22T18:55:58.000Z,Sup I love zombie farm,Love this except....,"I really wish somehow you could have friends on here. I love adding my time but it would be nice to see others recipes and share. I know you can share recipes but I wanted to say ""add"" my honey so we can both see the things we like and make comments or whatever social interactions could take place."
12200,12200,5,2015-05-03T10:44:34.000Z,Bonafidehustlayah,BEST DECISION EVER!!,"This app got me excited at 5:39 AM. As soon as I opened the app it began asking me personalized questions regarding my diet and preference. As a vegan, this is SO convenient and comforting! The app looks out for the ingredients I avoid for me. I have only scrolled threw a few recipes and I just had to rave about it to you all. I am so stoked to cook with this app. Definitely one the best downloads, hands down."
12201,12201,4,2015-08-28T22:29:47.000Z,iOS Passbook for rewards,Health & MyFitnessPal,Works with health for nutrient tracking purposes but I have to manually delete MyFitnessPal calculations if a added from in Yummly. That means checking each nutrient to see if it's double logged.
12202,12202,5,2015-11-23T19:43:04.000Z,Sasha and Maddie,Love this app,"I use this app almost exclusively for cooking and have loved the food I've made. The more I Yum the better the recommendations have been. Having said that, I have Yummed enough recipes it is hard to go back and find my favorites. I wish their was a favorite designation and a way to make notes about any adjustments I may have made."
12203,12203,4,2015-12-28T14:54:30.000Z,nan4ler,Love the recipes BUT...,"I love the recipes, however there are a few things I dislike:"
12204,12204,5,2016-02-25T18:59:19.000Z,Jaynieq,Easier than most places you want to access,"I am not that computer literate, and it scares me when I am trying to do one thing and it turns out it directs me to another unwanted spot. I appreciate having at my fingertips something useful and easy to use. I have made many new recipes and they were very good. Thank you!"
12205,12205,5,2016-06-05T20:21:15.000Z,SqueakyWheel5,Must-have app!,"If you cook, or want to cook, or just want someone to cook for you....get this app! Great for cooking, shopping, and inspiration. The recipes are endless. The videos are great for ""watch and learn"".  Shopping list was a must when I was in the grocery store. Or if you prefer, stay home and use Instacart for your ingredients delivery. I love using Yummly on all of my technology.   Thanks Yummly!"
12206,12206,2,2016-06-07T05:36:04.000Z,LiberalTXN,Needs fine tuning,"I get about half way through reading a recipe and the page reloads and I'm back at the top of the page. Which means that if I'm trying to actually follow the recipe I'd have to stop cooking, chopping, or stirring and scroll back down to find my place in the recipe. Please, PLEASE fix this! Also, as you continue to develop the app, please remember that what is so beautiful about it is the simple yet useful design of the user interface. No need to muck it up with animated back buttons and such."
12207,12207,4,2016-07-12T04:02:23.000Z,Spirowitz,Nice,I love the shopping list function and the fact that you can (kind of) access favorited items offline. I just wish that the search was a little more like the website and that I could see a boiled down version (pun intended) of the recipe offline once I favorite something. That would help me choose a recipe while I'm walking around the grocery store.
12208,12208,5,2017-04-20T08:45:47.000Z,Zappp13,So Many Choices!!!,"I love this app! I've always been a good cook who can imagine what a few ingredients will taste like together and make an awesome dish with them. But this app is a dream come true for inspiration! I use it constantly! There are countless, savory dishes, and the filter will lead you to what you're looking for, whether it's a lean meal or a hearty one in all kinds of cuisines and techniques!!!"
12209,12209,5,2017-04-21T17:14:17.000Z,Odiemena,My new go to,This app is my new go to whenever me and the wife can't decide what to cook. We've made a resolution to cut down on eating out and this app definitely makes it easier to do that. Why eat out when you can cook like a gourmet? I still need to work on my presentation skills though as my food is not quite ready for a Gordon Ramsey twitter critique LOL üòÇ
12210,12210,4,2013-10-19T19:24:17.000Z,Wiscoberry,Wonderful,Just feedback.  Great app!  Your protein section in nutrition doesn't exist.  It doesn't tell you how much protein per serving.  Another awesome add on would be a diet/ healthy eating section.  Type in bulking and get healthy pasta recipes.  Type in cutting get lean high energy meals.  Type in weight loss. Get healthy salads and light carbs.  Make it easier for new cooks to navigate and find recipes they like suited for lifestyle.  Just an idea.  Still awesome app!
12211,12211,4,2014-05-20T02:26:41.000Z,theoriginaltofu,Great app,"This app is amazing and is a lifesaver for a college student not trying to eat fast food every day. The only thing that seems counterintuitive is the refresh button at the top of the screen. It's not always there but when it rolls down or up, it flings the page a bit and it's kind of annoying. Other than that, this is probably one of my favorite apps"
12212,12212,5,2014-11-11T05:39:33.000Z,Torello77,Great recipe search engine!!,"I love to cook and finding recipes has never been easier. The fact that I can enter different ingredients to search and get recipes that include them is priceless. Nice being able to organize into my own categories, recommended list always helpful, and the user interface is very simple."
12213,12213,5,2015-01-03T14:35:13.000Z,Lena Carolina,Snazzy and Scrumptious,"I love this app! I've only had it downloaded for about two weeks or so and I haven't actually used a recipe from it yet. However, I love the layout of it and it's wide variety of settings. The filter option is fantastic and offers several choices based on dietary restrictions, etc. I plan on using a recipe tonight! Love it :)"
12214,12214,5,2015-02-28T16:02:57.000Z,Swara82,Absolutely love this app!,"I have been using yummly for the past few months. I love being able to categorize recipes and create custom categories like ""this week"". I love having my cookbook with me at the grocery store, it's great to refer to the app to know how much of an ingredient to buy. I have been a more creative and much better cook with this app!"
12215,12215,5,2015-04-30T18:44:05.000Z,Christie N.,Great app,"I love this app. All the great recipes and the shopping list feature is awesome. We never had any ideas of what to have for dinner before and that meant usually eating out or making something from a can or a box, but with the easy recipes on this app I actually cook dinner for my husband now so he's excited about that too."
12216,12216,5,2015-05-24T20:47:04.000Z,Sexybruin21,Best cooking app,I was skeptical about installing this app at first. It randomly popped up when I was googling a recipe for chicken thighs but just installed it anyway. I'm so glad I did because everything that I cooked using this app has come out DELISH and got raving compliments from everyone who tasted them. I have yet to be disappointed and doubt that I ever will at this point.
12217,12217,4,2015-11-30T05:49:21.000Z,Live color,"Great personalization, except for one thing","I love the personalization this app provides, it makes it easy to find recipes you will like. The only problem is that the ""diet"" selections are only for vegetarian, vegan, and paleo.  People on low cal,  low fat, low sugar, etc,  plans don't have any selection, so we have to wade through high cal/fat recipes to find ones that work for us. Luckily, we've gotten good at substituting!"
12218,12218,5,2017-01-24T19:26:11.000Z,J_Stud,One of the Best Apps,Use the app on your phone or log in on the computer. I Love the pictures included with the recipes and ratings by people. You have the ability to save and categorize your saves the way you like. Most importantly there are several recipes and various ways to make a dish. Fantastic app keep up the good work.
12219,12219,4,2017-07-18T01:39:30.000Z,Sara Lehman,Yummly Review-Deliciously helpful,"For me, Yummly has opened up doors into the world of cooking. It allows me to explore recipes that I otherwise would not have had the opportunity to do, and has an organized, easy and simple design. A feature that I believe would be helpful is to be able to write onto either the image or ingredient list, so that you can add your own notes to the recipe."
12220,12220,3,2015-02-07T17:53:08.000Z,Eemiller,"Lots of good, a few things could be better","Pros: very attractive UI, great recipe selection, great functionality to add ingredients to shopping list."
12221,12221,5,2015-05-10T15:36:09.000Z,mighty ducks fan,Love it! ‚ô°,"This app is super useful! It makes recipes really easy and fun to look through, especially with the great pictures. You can even organize your favorite recipes into folders you can name yourself. I also love that it suggests recipes in your home feed based on other ones you've saved! All around, awesome!!"
12222,12222,4,2015-10-30T21:09:14.000Z,Suzy594,My Yums menu=FRISTRATING!,"This app is an awesome app. Everything about it is really well crafted... Except the My Yums Menu. Half of the time it says you have more recipes then what show up when you click on the category!! Then you're forced to try and remember the name of what you had put with something in the My Yums Menu. Please fix this so all of the recipes you put in My Yums come up, not just some of them!"
12223,12223,4,2015-11-17T14:52:09.000Z,DJSarah,Love it!,I love this app so much its helped me make much healthier eating decisions that are just as tasty as unhealthy foods! My only complaint and the reason im giving it 4 stars is that while im scrolling through recipes the app keeps freezing and i have to keep closing it and reopening and then have to search for the recipe i was looking at. Fix that and ill be one happy camper and itll get 5 stars as intended when i first got the app üòÑ
12224,12224,5,2016-01-09T15:51:35.000Z,Chicago hoodrat,Yummy is the best,"This is one of the best websites for meal preparation.  It's simple, not complicated; tells you exactly what you will need and how to execute it.  Most of the meals have been great and if something went wrong it was because I improvised üòä.  I recommend it for all cooks.  And the variety is just vast.  You're sure to find something to fit your tastebuds."
12225,12225,5,2016-02-15T18:48:55.000Z,KLube115,Thumbs up!,"I love this app. It is a comprehensive app that searches blogs, food network, all recipes, and so on.  It gives multiple recipes when you search so you can find the one that's just right for you.  The only thing I don't love is the search capabilities-it's super sensitive and be careful with spelling errors. Otherwise...it's fantastic!!!"
12226,12226,5,2016-02-19T02:43:49.000Z,JLN1981,Insta-Chef!!,YUM is a boost to your food ego. It's the little idea engine that turns your kitchen into creation station. Never again will people rely on you to just bring the relishes. You'll call their relishes and raise them a Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. You'll confuse and shock your family. Mass hysteria will erupt when Grandma's Chocolate frosting is replaced by your Genache. Get this app and release your hidden superpower!
12227,12227,5,2016-12-11T19:28:00.000Z,Cinncher,Awesome Recipe App,I love Yummly!
12228,12228,5,2017-01-22T18:11:23.000Z,Garbage detector,Makes cooking much easier!,I never enjoyed cooking before because I hated organizing it all. Now I can search for recipes using what I have or create a shopping list on my phone. I have at least 10 go-to meals my family enjoys that are quick & delicious & I try new meals pretty often. The photos are great too.
12229,12229,5,2017-01-23T17:50:52.000Z,Pretty Boy Cooking,Men Who Can Cook,"I appreciate this app a lot! As a bachelor, I'm forced to cook my own meals every night and the Yummly app is the perfect tool to help me do that. Whenever I need to learn how to cook a certain dish, I open the app and am impressed by the array of recipe choices it provides. I've cooked many a meal from the Yummly app, so thank you! Without it I'd probably be eating TV dinners and In-n-Out burgers (lol)."
12230,12230,5,2013-11-27T21:39:13.000Z,PattieTrish,Loving it,"I hardly ever write reviews, but this app deserves it! I've used it a lot and find it very helpful to get ideas for dinner, parties, etc. The grocery list is brilliant! I also like that you can now categorize to find things faster. Now if only they can estimate your grocery bill based on your local prices...that would be magical."
12231,12231,5,2014-04-09T18:32:42.000Z,Siren A,Freakin love this app!!!!,"Ah mannnn. Everything fit together so well, so intuitive, and it all works! Even makes internal exceptions for my food allergies! Love this app, of the hundreds of apps I've downloaded in 4 months that I've had this iPhone5c, I think Yummly is my favorite so far. Wish I could get a bonus for how many people in tellin! Make life easy, Grab Yummly now! :)"
12232,12232,5,2014-07-15T01:58:51.000Z,SilentlySinful,Amazing,"My sister and I were never cooks before we started using this app, and now we love to cook!"
12233,12233,5,2014-08-31T22:44:54.000Z,Heatherbell102,Has revolutionized our cooking!,"Love everything about the app. The food restrictions, search functions, shopping list, etc...I only wish you could add your own recipes that aren't available through the app, so they could all be in one place. And there are some bugs in the shopping list."
12234,12234,5,2014-09-24T16:29:19.000Z,Samantha4080,Amazing! Find all my meals here!,Ever since my husband found this app I do not use anything else for my weekly meal plans. Been using this for a month and a half and we love it! We have found so many new exciting meals! We are also pescatarian and they allow you to put your diet preference like vegan or vegetarian or nothing! Love it. Thank you!
12235,12235,4,2015-12-15T21:43:11.000Z,cmr329,This is a really great app!,I really enjoy this app. It is colorful. It has a huge variety of recipes. You can customize it to whatever meals or events you want. I haven't figured out how to import outside recipes but I know you can do that. I see only 1 shortcoming and that is you can't make notes on the recipe for changes you may want to make.  Hence the reason for the 4 stars and not 5.
12236,12236,5,2016-07-26T21:05:31.000Z,Yagulyo,Very Convenient,"Yummly is my go to app when I need recipes, hands down. I used to google recipes when I needed them but since being introduced to yummly I have long given up Google. I like how it has all the recipes in one place, and you can save the ones you like and organize them to your satisfaction."
12237,12237,5,2016-09-11T06:51:00.000Z,Karen1024PetGirl,Super Convenient,I am so happy I found this app.  The cool thing is that you can tell it what type of recipes you want and it will return lots to choose from.  Select the ones you want and you can add the ingredients to your shopping list. Just check them off as you buy them. Serious time saver.
12238,12238,5,2016-12-28T03:02:42.000Z,Xoxochoco,Great app,"I love this app, it is my go to when looking for new or old recipes. I like that you can add different recipes to groups that you create, like Pinterest. I also really like that you can change the servings and it will automatically update the amount of materials needed. I recommend this app to all who love to cook and bake!"
12239,12239,5,2017-09-16T05:36:28.000Z,Tornadik,Love it,"I have been using it for a few years. As my dietary options have changed, I have continued enjoying the app using filters and finding types of food that meets my criteria. I add my favorite recipes to self created categories and revisit as needed. It is often my go-to app and I find it handy. Thank you for your great work!"
12240,12240,4,2013-10-11T22:40:30.000Z,ching-a-ling,Sweet!,"I love it! Very helpful recipe app with lots of content and an amazing design.  Very good at compiling the groceries I need into a list.   One thing I have trouble with is syncing yums from the web app to my phone, it sometimes doesn't work as expected (recipes not available on the mobile app).  Also, it would be nice if the recipe names didn't disappear when you scrolled down on the main recipe list."
12241,12241,5,2014-08-30T20:45:43.000Z,P120D1GY,A must-have tool for chefs of all levels,"This app is great on all aspects; good content catalog, updated often, great UI/UX on iPhone + iPad. The fact that you can filter based on dietary preferences (e.g. vegetarian, no pork, etc.) puts this app for beyond the other ""major"" cooking apps out there."
12242,12242,5,2014-12-13T09:13:45.000Z,Apprateroperating1173,Better than the food network app,"At first I was a little doubtful it would be as good as the food network app but turns out it was even better, simple beautiful clean layout and simple functions, gets to the point on how many calories, ingredients and cooking time and is ver very easy to use or learn to use."
12243,12243,5,2015-07-05T19:14:30.000Z,jobk0605,LOVE this app!!,"Yummy is by far the best recipe app I have used thus far. the recipes are creative and unique. this app gives GREAT selection for all the recipes you are looking for. i enjoy using yummly and love trying their new recipes. however the calculated nutrition facts are not always correct so if you count calories, ect. you may have to calculate them yourself."
12244,12244,5,2015-10-07T02:51:18.000Z,Billyraybar,Best Food App Available,"This app is fantastic.  The app uses your input like age, cooking level, likes and dislikes, etc to suggest recipes. Then you 'yum' the ones that you like and they are saved. When you like a recipe you are given the option to save all needs ingredients into a categorized shopping lists. Ingenious. Kudus to the developers"
12245,12245,5,2015-12-24T15:35:59.000Z,Pandap@ws,"Missed Punchfork, no longer","I loved using Punchfork before the site was bought out and I wasn't sure if I would find something similar to that. So far, this has been a great replacement. Colorful photos, I love the suggested recipes and how you can save what you want to try and/or what you've already made."
12246,12246,3,2016-01-20T18:44:25.000Z,Fiddlerbeauty,Used to be my favorite...,"The app isn't showing me all the recipes I've yummed, for some reason. Neither from the ""all yums"" screen nor from the specific lists, however if I search by name for a specific recipe I know I've added, it says I've already yummed it, even though it won't show up in my lists."
12247,12247,5,2016-04-14T19:01:55.000Z,Beautiful-Ruinz,Genius!,"Oh my goodness, I just love yummly, being able to choose what recipes I see, the calories and nutrition facts, etc. the app just takes it to a new level! Being able to make a mobile shopping list in app, and the way it can connect to the health app is just fantastic! 10/10 for this diet enthusiast."
12248,12248,5,2017-02-17T06:00:50.000Z,Bobolicious99,Best recipe saving app!,"I love this app!  I have tried several and this one is by far the best.  Easy to save your favorite recipes into the app. No having to copy and paste recipes or web addresses.  Easy to classify or organize your recipes.  The app will also give you recommendations based on your likes, allergies, and other preferences.  Love it!"
12249,12249,5,2017-02-22T01:04:38.000Z,dee_dance,Great App,I'm making a transition from vegetarian to vegan and it's not easy coming from a Hispanic (or any culture) that considers meat to make the meal or else! This app is making it easy to experiment with new foods! I love that you can modify it according to your any allergies you may have or what you like or do not like to eat! So many recipes to try! Thankful for this app!

12251,12251,5,2014-11-07T19:50:06.000Z,melissa cook,Great tool for meal ideas,My boyfriend and I love this app. We have been wanting to start cooking healthier but we are always on the go with our work schedules. This app is so convenient because we can share recipe ideas durning the day and the first person to get off work runs to the store to pick up the ingredients for the recipe.
12252,12252,5,2015-03-12T04:53:51.000Z,Bb1987891,Delicious recipes- great shopping cart feature!,"Has a great selection of recipes to make and many healthy options. You even have the ability to add all the ingredients to your ""shopping cart"" which is very helpful when at the grocery store trying to figure out what you need to buy."
12253,12253,5,2015-05-10T22:29:56.000Z,FamilyFun(AG),Best Cooking App,"This is the best cooking app I've been able to find and use. I've made several recipes from Yumly and they're all very good. Recipes are easy to find, save for later and rate. I tell everyone about it and always recommend it to friends and family when they're looking for recipes to make."
12254,12254,5,2015-08-04T23:24:42.000Z,Jaclann,Finally!!,I've been looking for a one stop shop app like this for a couple of years!!  What a well thought out sight.  A breeze to get the hang of and fantastic recipes that please my picky fam!!
12255,12255,4,2015-10-02T20:51:40.000Z,FarmDiva,Needs a few changes,"I love yummly but sometimes when I ""yum"" a recipe and then try to find it in my ""yums"" it's not there! I also find it very frustrating when the directions for a recipe won't load. Like another reviewer, I dislike the auto refresh on the home page. Would also be nice to view recipes in a side by side grid instead of single."
12256,12256,5,2016-07-24T15:42:56.000Z,Lillish,Loveeeeeeee,Love this ap! I use it every week when trying to schedule lunches/dinners for the week. I wish we could sync it to a shopping ap other then what they provide. That way when I add to shopping cart it goes to the normal ap I use. But that won't keep me from continuing to use this for our weekly meal planning!
12257,12257,5,2016-12-24T21:16:35.000Z,Msjae1030,Love this app!!!,"I absolutely love this app. It's easy to find recipes, and I love that I can store them in different categories. It's the only app I use for my recipes. Lastly, I love that there are reviews on the recipes. I can see variations or changes that others have made. I've tried other apps, but always come back to this one!"
12258,12258,5,2017-04-05T15:46:25.000Z,KelleyPaula3,"Best Recipe, Meal List, Grocery List creator EVER! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòé","I have been looking for an app that does everything Yummly does!  Like other pin to board apps but this one creates your shopping list and tells you what you are buying the item for, in case you change your mind!  Love it üòç!  Thank you, thank you, thank you for making this app!"
12259,12259,5,2017-07-29T22:38:25.000Z,spittinrivers,My go to recipe app,I've been using Yummly for about a year now.  It is a very simple app to input what you want to eat or what you have available. It's pretty amazing what recipes are in the library.  You can also categorize the things that you make in the things that you want to make extremely convenient.
12260,12260,5,2013-12-07T05:14:37.000Z,MonkeyButt82,Awesome app !!,Great app I love the fact that has great and different recipes. I can wait to try them. I like that it breaks the recipe into steps. Just few suggestions put tips and easier ways to sub ingredients.. Other than that great app keep up the good work . I think you should let us invite people through Facebook and twitter .
12261,12261,5,2014-03-09T13:19:49.000Z,ABittyAbroad,One of my most used apps,"This app is crazy good! I love that it inventories recipes from all over the internet, so I know I'm getting the best, most varied selection of recipes. My only wish was that you could search for recipes that use one specific ingredient instead of the title alone, but I think that's a very minor flaw."
12262,12262,2,2014-03-09T18:46:39.000Z,nmarie73,A lot of hype for nothing!,"I downloaded this app thinking it would make life a whole lot easier. It has a lot of nice features, but when I try to access recommended recipes from e-mail it keeps pointing me be back to downloading the app which I have already done. I have not found any way around this. It's quite annoying. I found it easier just to look for the recipes on my own outside their app and pin to Pinterest. Please fix this or this app is useless to me."
12263,12263,5,2014-07-26T23:27:24.000Z,Leese Jane,So Entertaining and Comforting,"I absolutely love this app. I enjoy reading all of the recipes and there are thousands to search. Another great feature for me  as my family is the calories as serving sizes, as well as the number of ingredients that it takes to make the recipe. I would suggest this app to anyone who loves to cook or to read cookbooks!"
12264,12264,5,2014-10-15T20:23:45.000Z,JadeFountain,Yummly love,I've had a bunch of various food apps over time.  This is the one I use all the time- for everything from ideas for what to do with my ingredients to full meal planning ideas before I do my grocery.  Plus you can adjust the servings and it automatically adjust all the ingredients.  Yummly is the best app for this lazy natural minded mom.
12265,12265,5,2015-03-06T03:13:39.000Z,Helmet Head,Love this ap!!,"I'm a married woman in my late 40's so I have some experience with cooking and recipe hunting. I love Yummly!!  I use it almost everyday, and have found many really, really good recipes.  If you are working on your culinary skills, or just looking for something different for breakfast, this is it. Download it...you won't be disappointed."
12266,12266,5,2017-02-08T02:43:02.000Z,MDee24,Excellent app!,"I've already made a variety of different dinners by using Yummly alone and my family loved every single dish! I'm not that experienced of a cook, so when it gave the exact measurements and ingredients needed for every dish that helped me tremendously. Really recommend for those wanting to try different dishes to make for dinner or any occasion!"
12267,12267,5,2017-02-23T18:35:19.000Z,Myfavoritewordiscannaliculi,This app is bomb af,"Love Yummly! It's my one and only stop for finding recipes from breakfast to dinner to desserts! The most wonderful part is adjusting my settings to how I like because sometimes I want vegetarian options and other times I might really want to try out a new way to cook meat, etc. 10/10 would def recommend!"
12268,12268,4,2017-06-11T17:12:34.000Z,JudeSZ,Everything I need it to be for now,Great resource for meals and have to say I've only had maybe one meal not turn out to my satisfaction. The app has nice features like the shopping cart (although I'd like it to be a little larger for more detail) and a nice direction feature that I wish was before the backstory write-up so I could just get right to the making.
12269,12269,5,2017-08-29T22:27:59.000Z,Jess'12,'Yummy' has thought of everything!!,"This app is fantastic, and its creators have thought of everything. You can choose between cuisine type, culture, diet plans, ingredients, and they'll even tell you when to start cooking in order to have everything done by a certain time. I'm in love!"
12270,12270,5,2014-09-28T19:17:23.000Z,dj phatmann,Excellent with room for growth,"This app is fantastic for finding recipes & shopping. It needs a few things to be perfect - an extension for adding recipes from Safari, & either iCloud syncing/ sharing with family, or an ability to sync to Reminders. Still, it's the best cooking & shopping app out there, by far"
12271,12271,4,2015-01-26T04:10:55.000Z,LaraCReads,Wonderful but needs more classic dishes,"I have been using the Yummy website for several years and the iPhone application for a couple. There are a great variety of recipes ranging in preparation and cooking time, number of ingredients, and also in origin. There are many fewer classic recipes as compared to home made concoctions, which is why I'm rating the app/website a 4/5 and not a 5."
12272,12272,3,2015-09-03T18:17:59.000Z,Tovadaun,Easy To Find and Save Recipes,Yummly has been a great tool to find and save recipes catering to what I'm looking for.
12273,12273,4,2015-09-12T21:06:35.000Z,Shaolinwk,Good App with lots of recipes,"I really like this app. It has lots of options. My only problem is that I have issues with corn and all corn products and it isn't one of the ""preset"" dietary issues. As a result I have to manually enter it as an exclusion as well as each individual variation each time I do a search. If I didn't have to re-enter it each time I would give 5stars."
12274,12274,5,2015-10-18T16:34:09.000Z,scarivin,Great App. Easier than a Google search,"So easy to find new recipes, no matter what you're cooking. Love the compilation of ingredients and cooking times separate from directions. For someone just getting into the practice of cooking, this app makes it fun and easy to try new things and while staying in one's comfort zone."
12275,12275,5,2016-03-20T22:59:08.000Z,Blendieofindie,Great app,Overall I like it.  Well designed and useful.
12276,12276,5,2016-03-22T15:15:03.000Z,Penny Tweed,Very helpful!,"I love this app. It's brilliant for when I have a party or bdays coming up and I need to think of a recipe that I haven't done a million times already. The shopping list is convenient and while it took me a bit to learn the bells and whistles of the app, once learned you begin to appreciate how smartly it is put together."
12277,12277,5,2016-05-17T04:21:19.000Z,Ta2barbee,Live for YUM,"This app is everything!! It provides nutritional info, recipes, and more!! You can even quickly start a grocery list for your choice of recipes!! It's extremely helpful for someone on the go that enjoys cooking new and different things .. The visuals are amazing too!!! Live for this app!! So does my family! üòâ‚úåüèªÔ∏è"
12278,12278,5,2016-06-15T22:46:44.000Z,AMWstudio,Vegan made easy!,"I love this app because of the customizable dietary preferences and accurate recipe results. I also like that the ingredients are given in a simple, easy to read list before having to open a website."
12279,12279,4,2016-07-30T04:03:30.000Z,Jshops,Easy to use but can lose place,I find the app very easy to use and have found some new and great recipes even for unique dietary needs.  I just wish it would remember/keep your place      - frustrating to have to search again for same recipe you were using just because u had to switch apps in the middle of using recipe.
12280,12280,5,2013-10-06T18:58:51.000Z,FancyPants998,Best recipe app,This app is so customizable for food preferences and dietary restrictions. It lets you chose everything from taste preference to calorie count to prep time. You can even pick ingredients that you don't want in recipes. When you choose a recipe you can add the ingredients to your shopping list in the app. I highly recommend this app.
12281,12281,4,2014-11-02T20:00:23.000Z,XxRiskyxX86,so easy and simple.,"I started using this app because I was getting bored, eating the same thing week after week. The recipes are easy to make and you can find almost anything you're looking for, from simple homemade recipes to the extreme and even drinks. This app has saved me so much time because I always have dinner right at my fingertips."
12282,12282,4,2015-01-10T15:40:24.000Z,JoziBear,Great App But,"I love this app it has some very good qualities about it. I like that it is easy to navigate and that you can use keywords to search for recipes... My only down side that makes me hate using this app is the ads that take over when reading, redirecting me to the App Store... It's annoying enough to not use it and just go to google and search..."
12283,12283,5,2015-04-20T14:18:43.000Z,Vvcook,The only recipe app you need,"I love this app. It pulls recipes from every source. From All Recipes to Ina Garten, they come up with pictures so its easy to select the recipe you want. Then there is an easy list of ingredients that you can use as your shopping list. I got rid of all the individual site apps and just use this one."
12284,12284,4,2015-11-27T18:43:12.000Z,OgreFinger,Great app but it doesn't sho...,I really wish the app would make the dish titles whole. All the titles of the recipes that I wade through are truncated. For example:
12285,12285,1,2016-03-06T17:37:12.000Z,Jeffross4,Terrible,This is what is wrong with the internet these days. A website is built for collecting recipes. But you are forced to download an add filled app to even view the recipes. After scrolling past the life story of how someone is always reminded of the first time they met their husband over chicken wings at a super bowl party. And scroll past 40 other click-bait recipes for more football recipe favorites. You finally get to the original recipe you were looking for in the first place. Just to see what the ingredients are. Complete waste of time.
12286,12286,5,2016-07-13T16:33:42.000Z,plkquilt,Wonderful recipes,Yummlyhelps me plan out meals for the week so when I go shopping I get everything I need and I don't have to wonder what are we going to have for dinner depending on what I can find in the cupboards!  It's nice to save the recipes that work for us and they are all in one place not scribbled on pieces of papers that wind up scattered. I love yummly!
12287,12287,5,2017-06-14T03:06:20.000Z,The swag chicken 68,I ‚ù§Ô∏è YUMMLY!!!,"This app is AMAZING!!! I absolutely love this app! So good! I am a baker/chefy person...? (Or at least trying to be one when I get older) and I am addicted to this app. My family always has the same old same old dinners, but now with Yummly it spices up our dinners with a new suprise! Like ""OH! Hey this is a do-over!"" But overall, great app, love it to bits, phenomenal job. Thank you! üòò"
12288,12288,4,2017-07-13T16:41:57.000Z,Juli.Estrada9346571,Good but not yet perfect,I like Yummly but its programmed meals features isn't working too well. It doesn't let you put your progress so the app know where in the process you are. It would be nice if you could also add update suggestions to the recipes (sometimes the real time it takes to make something is very different from the one listed)
12289,12289,5,2017-09-06T21:48:38.000Z,simmjen,A true lifesaver,"This app makes eating at home fun, easy, delicious and attainable. The recipes can accommodate endless food allergies and dietary preferences, they make grocery shopping easy, and most importantly, the app helps you manage your time with reminders of when to begging cooking in order to have dinner on the table at a goal time."
12290,12290,5,2014-01-08T16:02:43.000Z,Sachmu,Useful!,Great app! I have made several recipes from it already. So easy to just pull up my 'yums' and follow along on the instructions. I love the feature of adding ingredients to a shopping list. I just picked up my phone at the grocery store and was able to see exactly what I needed (for multiple recipes!).
12291,12291,4,2014-01-22T19:33:30.000Z,getyasome57,Greatest Thing Ever!,No longer do I have to waste time writing down recipes or money on cookbooks! Everything I need to find is within this app! Recipes sent to Facebook timelines disappear after a period of time but not to worry! Type it into search and Yummly will find it and save it to my yums! Pictures and videos are priceless; you won't get those in a cookbook!
12292,12292,4,2014-04-21T04:04:39.000Z,AwesomeGuyForever,Great App... I use it often,"I was looking for a cooking recipe app for a while and came across this app a few months ago.  Ever since I started using it, this app has become my first app to look for recipes.  Some quirks like timeout login takes back to the top of the page rather than scrolled mid position, not a great  resolution etc can be improved but overall a great app."
12293,12293,5,2014-06-07T15:12:42.000Z,Gpulido,My favorite,Best food app ever! It makes looking for recipes so much easier. I would appreciate it more if I closed the app and the app would remember where I left off because it currently makes me start the process all over again every time it closes (I switch apps or minimize it). Overall great.
12294,12294,5,2014-08-14T16:27:44.000Z,Matthew Paul Smith,Great app for all diets!!,This app is so much better than most.  Most recipe apps either don't have enough recipes for all diet types or have ads like crazy or want you to purchase recipes.   This app also does shopping lists for recipes you want to use and has a website to use on a computer.
12295,12295,5,2014-08-30T05:32:32.000Z,Doctanroxxo,Chef approved!,"I'm a cook whose been cooking professionally for 5 Plus years, and am a pure foodie. This app is a godsend, absolutely live it! The app is easy to use, the pictures make your mouth water, the shopping list feature is amazing, and the option to save your recipes in different categories is wonderful. Absolutely Amazing job!"
12296,12296,5,2015-12-27T02:30:08.000Z,PW Shelton,Great app!,"Yummly is a wonderful recipe app. The layout and design are smart and pleasing to the eyes. Ingredients, calories and directions are easily accessible and the recipe filing system is really helpful with custom naming! My only problem is the occasional freeze up when connecting to sites for directions on recipes. I'd highly recommend it."

12298,12298,5,2016-08-07T01:00:36.000Z,J soto,Great App!!!,I love this app! I have been using it for some time now and it is the best! It's great for new recipes and I like that you can put ingredients and it will give you recipes. I also love that you can put what you don't eat and it will filter the recipes that way! By far one of the best recipe apps I've come across!!! Happy cooking!

12300,12300,5,2014-02-10T16:30:35.000Z,Iphone5NewB,Love it but need and enhancement,I love this app and use it regularly to fix meals. However I just wish I had the ability to add personal notes to the items I Yum. Sometimes I make little tweaks to the recipes and want to keep those changes on record. I would love it if you added this to the app!
12301,12301,5,2014-03-05T03:35:47.000Z,Chinaman1026,Clean and useful,"I'm working on learning one recipe a week and this app makes it easy to find and keep track of things to try and their ingredients. I do wish it could host the directions in app though, as websites tend to refresh at the top and the text is not optimized for mobile."
12302,12302,5,2014-03-25T16:52:40.000Z,TLane001,Highly Recommend this app,"Love the presentation and the options presented when searching receipts.  I do wish once I've added a recipe to a category (dinner, healthy snacks,...) I could add notes like add potatoes and add my own items to the shopping list.  But love this app and have recommended it to friends who want to cook more at home."
12303,12303,5,2014-04-07T04:32:14.000Z,ilisten2thenews,Extremely well designed app!!!,"The best food app in the AppStore right now! The UI is great, very snappy and clean. Sharing on social media is easy."
12304,12304,3,2014-05-26T04:06:47.000Z,Action Comics Girl,Pretty Neat,"Not a bad app and I do love the large selection of recipes. That being said the filters need work, I'm a vegan and when I put on the vegan filter I still get recipes with meat and eggs included. It'll take a much better filter to get me to switch from my vegan only apps to this one full time. For people with no dietary restrictions it'd be a must, for me it'll only be an occasionally, at least until the filters are tightened up."
12305,12305,5,2014-07-27T17:53:51.000Z,Benther,EVERYTHING YOU NEED!!!,"I have visited plenty of food sites, downloaded recipes, bought cookbooks, but Yummly has it all! Everything I search for I find- that and several other versions of it. If you need diet, healthy, or something downright sinful, they have the recipe. It's easy to maneuver - what more could you ask for. I love it."
12306,12306,2,2014-11-24T15:51:49.000Z,Waffalafel,Broken shopping list feature,"The shopping list is glitchy at best. After adding fewer than ten items, several category headers (Breakfast Foods, Dairy) started duplicating and their items would all but disappear into thin grey bands. When I tried to move those items between categories to try and refresh them, the app simply crashed. Deleted after a couple of minutes; +1 star for other potential features I neither needed nor cared to test."
12307,12307,5,2015-07-01T00:05:26.000Z,Ali Kap,Awesome App,"Do you like cooking? The this would be a good app for you. You can search for foods and ""yum"" the food if you like it. You can create folders to put your yums in. You can find out what you need to bake the food. You can also add your own cooking recipes. It's a fun way to learn how to bake and if you already know how to bake on! Enjoy the app!"
12308,12308,4,2015-11-08T20:10:59.000Z,Mr. Damond,Love this app,"I love this app. I had it for probably a little two months, I already used at least twenty recipes. The one complaint that I have, I don't like how the app goes back to the home screen when the phone goes into rest mode. Also, I can't see all of the recipes that I save. I have to do a search for them. Other than that, i use it a lot."

12310,12310,5,2014-01-08T01:27:29.000Z,Cardnlsws06,Great app!!,"We were Looking for a recipe app and this fits the bill perfectly.  Really enjoying the ability to ""yum"" recipes and essentially create your own custom cookbook.  Clever design, easy to use and full of great recipes from several different sites.  My wife and I have really enjoyed this...oh and the kids too"

I have to actually remember what each recipe is called and search for it or use Yummly on my computer. I don't know about you all, but setting up my computer in my kitchen would be a pretty big pain."
12313,12313,5,2015-12-13T23:56:08.000Z,Aspiboxer,Great App,This app is quick and easy. Just look up what you want to make. Choose the recipe version that seems the most appealing to you and go. I love having the option to choose from many different versions of the same recipe. It makes it easy to tailor to your likes.
12314,12314,1,2016-01-13T16:24:06.000Z,mutsi74,Used to be great but now doesn't work at all,"I've spent a lot of time yumming and categorizing recipes and for the past week or so, it won't let me in the app (iPhone 6 / iOS 9.2). It gets stuck in the sign-in screen and when I press ""Continue with Facebook"" nothing happens although it used to work just fine. Same if I go to an external recipe site and try adding to my Yums; it tells me that I don't have a Yummly account which is clearly not true. The website seems to work just fine. Please fix your mobile app!"
12315,12315,5,2016-02-23T07:01:39.000Z,Tiffaney S.,My go to app,This is by far the best app i've ever used for recipes! It is also the first place i look before preparing a meal to see if i can add something new to my recipe. I can search for anything i have a taste for and i haven't had a bad dish yet. I also like that i can modify the serving size and it will calculate the recipe for me.
12316,12316,5,2016-07-17T02:20:58.000Z,Sooznd,My Go To!,"Yummly is my new go to cookbook. I can sort and sift through versions of recipes to find the one that suits what I want. Calories and ingredients are posted upfront, saving me scrolling through 50 ads and twenty paragraphs to make my decision. Then I can sort and save my favorites to access them easily again."
12317,12317,5,2016-10-13T21:05:55.000Z,Shadler,This app is doppppppe,Every recipe you could ever want to make is in this app! I just scroll and scroll and watch cooking videos and yum recipes all day. Then at the end of the week I put together my shopping list on the app from the recipes i yummed and have everything delivered from instacart. Saves me so much time.
12318,12318,5,2017-02-05T05:32:42.000Z,Spotify Enthusiast,Game Changer,"This app is amazing. Just tried it out and absolutely LOVE how easy it was to get my list for the week ready to go, and how convenient it was to shop as it categorized all my foods, making my trip to the grocery that much quicker. I will definitely be using this for the foreseeable future!"
12319,12319,5,2017-04-22T07:29:20.000Z,jofepole,Useful time and money saving app but...,"Awesome tool for getting what you need done.  The time saving grocery list and Instacart ordering is fabulous.  Choosing entrees and building menu collections is nice.  Wish list includes a a more robust menu planning function with a calendar, but otherwise it's on the right track."
12320,12320,5,2014-05-10T19:29:40.000Z,WinterBlood217,Amazing!!,I use this app all the time. Perfect for finding all types of recipes! All the filters are pretty much the best thing ever. I love it so much.
12321,12321,1,2014-10-24T08:40:36.000Z,Lovbucket,To many processed food ads,In the beginning I loved this app it was my go to app for cooking. But now after a year I have noticed that the first couple of recipes that appear are from their corporate sponsors and these companies just want to push their processed food items. I am now getting email about recipes from them as well. It is annoying and I am over it. Yummly just ruined their app by selling out. Good look finding decent recipes that don't market to you to buy processed food items. Real food yummly not fake food. Very sad.
12322,12322,5,2015-01-26T00:25:23.000Z,Swagontthat,Awesome,"This app really inspires me to try new recipes. The search function works great, and the recommendations they give you for ""yumming"" are great too. I never head to the grocery store without opening up this app first! Best shopping companion because you make a grocery list in Yummly. And it's FREE! I won't need another food app anytime soon!"
12323,12323,5,2015-11-17T20:26:12.000Z,BlackRoseAngel,Love Cooking? You'll Love This App,This app has a lot of amazing and powerful features for any chef. The database of recipes is huge and only getting bigger. And with it you can even connect it to some of the most popular fitness tracker apps helping you in your journey to become fit or a healthy eater. This is a must for any foodie!!!
12324,12324,5,2016-06-14T22:47:33.000Z,Shipc,So useful,"I love this app. I cook so much and this app allows me not only to save a recipe but categorize it. I just wish there was a category with a reminder of what you want to make the following night, I have 4 kids and I can use all the proverbial post-its I can get!! This is a great app, the pictures are pretty spot on."
12325,12325,5,2016-07-04T03:15:24.000Z,Ipsnicerous,Yummly is my Sioux Chef,"Yummly uses data to give you intelligent recipes. Yummly's powerful ingredient search features yield a treasure trove of ideas that inspires my cooking. As a vegetarian, Yummly filters my results to only show me things I can eat! The preferences are  invaluable to people with allergies or other restricted diets. Definitely the best cooking app available."

I absolutely can't say enough about this app, other  than I love it and always look forward to what great recipes I'll find in the ""community"" out there in Yummly land. Share with everyone and rate the recipes, it helps!"

The search filters are really useful; they have helped me find lots recipes that work with my diet. I like that it's easy to save and organize recipes, and (almost) everything I have cooked has been delicious."
12328,12328,5,2017-08-02T21:21:34.000Z,noanchor42,Calendar sync!!!,I've always appreciated Yummly but every once in a while I would stop using it for several reasons but when I signed back in after a while I saw their new update where it works out the prep-cook-eat times and then syncs it with my calendar-- exactly what I needed. Kudos Yummly team!
12329,12329,5,2017-09-29T03:10:02.000Z,SagRat,Very useful and functional,"I love this app. It's simple to use, but has a wide variety of options that pop up. Perfect if I want something standard to make, or want to browse for an off the wall new recipe. I am also getting a lot of use out of the 'add to shopping list' function. So great!"
12330,12330,4,2013-09-18T15:07:43.000Z,LeoD3,Super excited‚Ä¶but,"So excited Yummly finally made an app. Was just a matter of time. The app is beautifully designed and works great. I hope for the future updates to include Collections and being able to add ""Yummed"" recipes to the collections. Also the World uses METRIC systems. I hope future releases will have some fancy algorithm to convert the recipes. Thank you Yummly and lets see you SOAR."
12331,12331,5,2014-01-02T22:38:31.000Z,Jai Jai Ma,Best Cooking App ever!,This is my go to app for everything cooking. I absolutely love that it searches the internet for recipes and I can chose the one that I like best. The other feature that I really use a lot is that you can put the recipes in a folder to use again. It's the absolute best app out there hands down!
12332,12332,5,2014-02-07T14:55:19.000Z,Rick38104,Outstanding!,"The app has a great interface and top notch features. Like any assortment of recipes culled from the web, some recipes are better than others. But that is not the fault of the app, just the nature of the beast. I've shown this app to a lot of people and almost all have installed it on the spot."
12333,12333,5,2014-02-09T18:45:37.000Z,Linda Horse Woman,Scrumptious App!!,"Has it all organized for you! Right at the tip of your fingers! Easy to use! Best feature is the ""Shopping List"". When you see an ingredient that you don't have, tap it and it goes into a shopping list so you don't have to write it down, then lose the paper...uh...oops I forgot the list!! Love it!!"
12334,12334,4,2014-03-07T19:44:50.000Z,Scriptspring,"Good, but could be better","This is a helpful app and I appreciate the layout and ease of use. However, I thought the shopping cart feature would fill with selected recipes, but it doesn't seem to do this. Also, some searches bring up items that have nothing to do with the search words that just wastes time."
12335,12335,4,2015-02-24T17:32:43.000Z,Thescooper,Nice app.... But,Lately a lot of recipes have an error display on the directions page. Not all recipes but a lot. Even ones I have saved have errors. It says the referring website is experiencing problems. I have reported to customer service to no avail. Wish they would check & correct the links associated with their recipes.
12336,12336,5,2015-05-23T05:11:18.000Z,XPGFRMR,The Perfect Food App,"This app does it all, yet is easy to use. I love the beautiful photos, and easy to follow directions. The part is that it allows you to create a grocery / ingredients list with the touch of the screen. I also like the way you can set filters for allergies and foods you don't like. ‚ù§Ô∏è this!"
12337,12337,2,2015-08-28T01:39:38.000Z,~Not a fan~,Where is the full recipe?,"The app is good for inspiration, with beautiful pics and nice filtering options. I also like how you can add all of the needed ingredients to a well organized shopping list. The problem is that you don't get instructions on how to make the recipe, just the ingredients. That makes the app pretty worthless to me. If the entire recipe was available and the grocery list could be shared with another person or another app, then this would be a great app."
12338,12338,4,2016-02-28T04:17:23.000Z,Danno1300,"Great recipes, but app doesn't always work well",I love the recipes and I recommend the app to everyone  who is interested but the app doesn't always work well on my iPad. It frequently freezes or just quits while in use. In fact I had to write this review 3 times because it quit on me.
12339,12339,5,2016-03-10T04:56:11.000Z,D3uc3$,Almost Perfect!,"I absolutely love this app! Only thing that I would like to be able to do is swipe left on a recipe (I will never like or want) and it will be gone forever. This would be nice so I'm not scrolling through a lot of repeats. But hey, it's not that big of a deal, I still LOVE it and will continue to use it!!"
12340,12340,5,2014-01-05T21:49:12.000Z,Leor333,Best food app period.,I seriously love this app! I'm already a good cool but have a hard time thinking of new ideas. With this app that isn't a problem anymore. Something you guys should add is a way to go straight from email to mobile app. Especially if you like the recipe. I use yummly exclusively on my iphone.
12341,12341,5,2014-01-19T17:19:39.000Z,Novice chef,Love this app!,"Learning to cook has been... interesting, but this app really gets me excited about trying new recipes. I love that I can search and find so many great recipes. And after I've ""yummed"" a few, it gives great recommendations. I've had no trouble with the app at all and I use it almost daily. Love it!"
12342,12342,4,2014-11-09T15:31:29.000Z,Bwhite0815,Love this app,"I love this app. Especially that you can make your grocery list with it, so convenient and easy. Only one thing is sometimes it will cut off part of the ingredient if description is too long for the line so you have to open recipe to see what that ingredient really is. But great recipes and very easy to use. And you can save your favorites."
12343,12343,5,2015-02-01T02:28:51.000Z,LucindaGW,No more boring meals!,"I was searching for a grocery list app and found Yummly. After only 10 minutes of browsing the app I had five new dinner menus for the week.  I love the way it integrates the ingredients into my grocery list. Better yet, I can select the ingredients to add to the list. Very well designed app."

I also like that we can up the skill level of the recipes as we progress. Plus you can't beat the variety and being able to search recipes by specific ingredients!"
12345,12345,5,2015-08-28T12:38:57.000Z,Shaglover,The best,Love‚ù§Ô∏è. You can glance at ingredients and then view the whole recipe plus instructions. Most recipes have multiple reviews which are invaluable. Plus an option to save favorites or ones you want to try. I use it everyday. Absolutely the best recipe app there is; and I've tried many.
12346,12346,5,2015-09-06T17:28:19.000Z,Twinklej4,Great Recipes!,"This is the best app for recipes that I have found. Great recipes...photos...instructions. It's easy, fun and addicting to organize all of your favorites. Add your own categories too.

Searching is great on here, still has link to cooking blog so you can read more about recipes...my favorite app."
12351,12351,4,2014-11-08T03:13:47.000Z,Tterminator,Great app but needs expanded shopping list,"I love the recipe searches and auto grocery list population!  The only negative is that the only non food item category for the shopping list is ""other"" which makes you go all over the store if you need to get paper towels and toothpaste.  You should be able to edit your categories."

I entered these in the special diet section but when I search for recipes the results include many recipes that gluten and the other restricted items. What's the point of entering all of those things if the information doesn't screen your recipe options? Am I missing something?

12355,12355,5,2015-07-13T23:34:30.000Z,Top Mom Chef,Amazing,Love this app. I use it all the time and find delicious options for me and my family. Can look by cuisine or what I have in the house. Either way easy to use and some of the sites it leads you to lead you to other great recipes. I don't think I can live without it or want to try!

I love that they are all stored in one place and I can keep them organized. I love scrolling through the feed of recipes suggested just for me. Found a lot of great recipes using this app.
12359,12359,5,2017-06-07T21:31:06.000Z,ellerzz,Pretty simple,Took me a while to figure everything out but I love it. Love that I can add my own groceries to my list and not just the ingredients from the recipes I added. I bring my list up on my Apple Watch when I'm shopping. With two little ones having my list on my wrist is awesome.

I also recommended to my friend who's little boy was just diagnosed as having a gluten allergy. Enter in preferences and you have whatever needs met.

I wish there were a way to call up recipes with just certain ingredients in them (e.g. recipes with tomatoes and jalape√±os), and as others have said a note section with each ""yummed"" recipe and maybe a rating system too, but AWESOME work so far! I've recommended it to many :)"

12364,12364,4,2016-02-06T13:16:29.000Z,Fevered Reader,Beautiful & Functional,"I love how sleek and pretty the app is and being able to filter and search through so many recipes has made it abundantly clear how I can eat with variety and stay healthy. My only issue is how I end up back at the home screen if I'm in the middle of the recipe and my phone locks. Other than that I love, love, love this app."
12365,12365,4,2016-09-23T02:25:39.000Z,Dell46,Great app for recipes and shopping list,"Really like this app for recipes and shopping list. Wish it were a little more intuitive. In the shopping list part of app I wish I could add categories to shopping list. We seem to be  limited to ""alcohol, baby food, bakery,...etc"". There are other sections of grocery store that are not represented."

However, with this new update, all my ""Yums"" were deleted and so now I wish I had written down the recipes I enjoyed."
12367,12367,5,2016-10-19T16:20:51.000Z,Mythicon,Excellent,"This app has become my standby for recipes. Rather than just one recipe for a meal, you can view several variations and decide which you would like better. You can create a shopping list from the ingredients, filter for allergies, and specify ingredients in your pantry. Love this app."
12368,12368,5,2016-10-28T13:00:01.000Z,Jennfree86,Amazing,"I absolutely love this app, it has so many great features. I've started to check it otw him from work to find whatever recipe would work that night for dinner with the ingredients I already had.  The categories of any kind of diet and allergen to select or avoid is amazing too!"

Plus by seeing how many people selected ""Yum"" you can tell how good it is, or be the first to give it the first yum to let people know how delicious. You can organize your dinners & side dishes too. It's amazing!"
12371,12371,5,2015-01-17T22:21:20.000Z,Beck K.,Very Nice App,This app does what it is intended to do. I can search for recipes and store them neatly in the app. I could do the same thing on Pinterest but then I would have to fish through all the other stuff too. This app is quick and easy to use. I have recommended it to friends.
12372,12372,4,2015-01-19T13:56:55.000Z,KC_CPA,Good Resource,"This app comes in handy to search for recipe ideas. Instead of having to search multiple websites this app does the work for you. Sometimes the search is more limited than I like but it still works. Also, the recommendations can be redundant at times if you already saved a very similar recipe."

Where I could create a weekly menu and grocery list. It has a ton of awesome recipes that you can save for yourself. Would highly recommend this app to anybody no matter their diet allergies.

12376,12376,5,2015-09-18T13:15:02.000Z,Jessie44120,Could not live without it!,Some many good things on this app. My favorite thing is how i can add ingredients to my shopping list on the app and I can still use the same list to add other things even if the recipe is not on the app so no need for a second shopping list.
12377,12377,4,2015-11-16T01:34:28.000Z,rokout,Beautiful app,"I really like this cooking app!  The app is layed out really well and easy to search.  However, some of the recipes I've put in my ""Yums"" and/or categorized are not showing up when I go to look at them.  I've tried resetting the app to no avail, this needs to be fixed.  But overall, a very easy app to use with lots of Yummy recipes!!!"

Nice variety, ability to filter results based on allergen, and easy filing and searching.

Always has something simple and great for any occasion.  There are more complex recipes but generally everything is easy, quick, and inexpensive.  I tell everyone about the app and use it regularly."
12380,12380,5,2013-11-30T22:02:38.000Z,Love21christ,I use this app almost everyday!,I love that this app adjusts to your tastes and has filters to eliminate foods you don't eat or foods you are allergic to. The way the recipes are organized is helpful. You get all the basic information about the recipe before you are taken to the complete recipe.

Much easier to use the app than the website from a mobile device. Well done, thanks to this app, I cook way more than I used to!"
12383,12383,4,2015-06-14T01:18:41.000Z,Checocruz,Great pictures!,I love cookbooks with pictures to show me what it suppose to look like. The site is somewhat user friendly. The recipes are available on different sites so it takes a little to navigate through and the sites aren't all the same so you have to dig through to find it sometimes.
12384,12384,4,2015-09-09T23:50:47.000Z,bbkitty1993,Vee,"Great photos and recipes. Tends to crash after prolonged use and while I love the menu suggestions that are sent via email; it doesn't know that I have the app already when I touch a picture of the recipes and I have to ""go fish"" for the ""Recipe Suggestions."" Maybe fix that so a user can access it quickly. üòâ"

I am now a genius chef and my girlfriend loves me more than ever. Get this if you want a girlfriend, or boyfriend. Whatever, I love this app."

12387,12387,2,2016-10-22T10:24:19.000Z,Kccraig3295,Last update,"I have been using this app for a long time and, as a personal chef, it was a godsend! However, the way it is set up now....well, it's awful! Clicking on a recipe and getting lots of other choices you have to wade through through is time consuming or it tells you it's no longer available."
12388,12388,3,2016-11-21T18:05:53.000Z,Infoiseducation,Too much commercial interference,"While the recipes are in itself good and accessible. The commercials and interference by 3 parties or parties steering you to their sites makes me often times just Google the recipe I am looking for. The site needs much improvement, including personal saving tab, notes to edit recipes for self use. Memory that goes back to previous recipe"

When I reopen it I must log back in in order to save a recipe, etc. Then it takes me to a login screen, I log in and then it closes! So I cannot use the feature to save recipes for later. I can only search them as a guest. Why won't it leave me logged in?"

My only complaint is that in order to view directions for the recipe  from some sites, you have to become a member first. All things associated with yummly has been pleasant."

I love the recommendations too. I have other recipe apps but don't even use them anymore!
12395,12395,5,2015-01-23T01:35:36.000Z,Lalalabubbie298,Download this app!,Absolutely love this app. Great recipes and so many to chose from. My favorite part is I can type in a food item that I'm looking to get out of my fridge and it gives me a list of meals to make with it. And it's full of vegetarian recipes too! Can't recommend this app enough.
12396,12396,2,2016-11-30T23:32:48.000Z,partsace,No Logic & Too Many Ads,"Logic issues in the flow of this app. If you leave a recipe open and come back, POOF, it's gone! Also, when you open a recipe, people want to see the ingredients AND the instructions without having to click extra buttons. Then, a million ads pop-up. Half the page with ads is overkill! I don't need to go shopping for everything on the ingredients list. 85% of them you should already have!"

No matter what you're in the mood for, sweet tooth, healthy bites, down home cooking or Thai food, Yummly had a recipe for you. And don't fret about missing ingredients because you can make a grocery list for the recipe. This app is so awesome. Oops I said that already! üòÅ"

I refer to it often with our busy schedules. It's great that you can rate your own recipes and save only those you would consider making again. Great app!"

Or like me looking for new ideas to keep your new life changing eating habits.
12401,12401,5,2015-06-03T23:13:32.000Z,nutter butter lover,Awesome and free,There really isn't much you can complain about when you get a quality app for free. Only thing I might suggest is editing the format of the recipes bc the font and stuff is sometimes hard to read while I'm multitasking between reading and cooking.
12402,12402,5,2015-06-30T12:30:32.000Z,iRate U,Yummy,"I found this app. out of desperation to help me come up with a recipe for my take on apple pie. I got some great ideas.

Since summer started and the heat is just relentless I've also enjoyed using it to help me come up with some cooling smoothie ideas YUMMY!!!üòä"
12403,12403,4,2015-08-30T14:38:59.000Z,Crayauchtin,Cool,"This is a great app for households that have a lot of dietary restrictions.  If I had any suggestions it would just be to add more diet plans -- high protein, for instance."
12404,12404,4,2015-11-09T19:38:11.000Z,UnicorniaXXIV,So close to being the perfect app,"The customizable criteria is perfect for all of my diet restrictions! The only problem, and it's kind of silly, is that I wish there was a bigger variety of recipes. For example, I was looking for some classic Hispanic dishes and there were few variations of the same dessert and some just didn't come up at all."
12405,12405,4,2015-11-10T00:50:57.000Z,Sunshinelove703,Great app,"I often turn to this app for some ideas mostly for dinner. It's very easy to navigate, my only complaint is that the recipe results can be quite redundant at times, and I wish there was an option to search 2-3 ingredients and have matching results, rather than the title of the recipe. I must stress this is still my favorite recipe app!!"

I've had it for 2 days and have already cooked 4 recipes. It has everything you could imagine. It's also super easy to use and has many dietary filters.
12408,12408,4,2016-05-29T16:03:37.000Z,Mambo Miller,I hate this app!,Won't let me log in through Google (because button doesn't enable) and then couldn't navigate back to find a recipe I wanted to try that was the last thing on the screen before trying to log in. Searching didn't turn it up either. Lousy app; don't bother to download.
12409,12409,5,2016-06-14T10:23:55.000Z,Future Mrs.McP,Best food app I've used!,I love that you can look at all different kinds of recipes and see what is different from one to another! I love that it also has a filter that has dietary preferences or to stay away from certain foods! It also suggests recipes you might love!

The pictures make everything look delightful and serve as wonderful motivation for making a 5-star dish every night. Whoever thought to create this app is a genius, and I am indebted to him/her."
12412,12412,4,2014-01-27T13:26:56.000Z,Triquichic,Changed what I expected from recipe apps,The pictures and the menu options alone put this app above the rest.  I love how they actually curate the recipes and take you directly to the internet source of the recipe.  It would be even better if one could directly pin the recipes to Pinterest or Pepperplate or even an offline viewer.
12413,12413,4,2014-02-02T03:07:06.000Z,NYsweeti,Love this App!,I absolutely love this app! It gives me so many options from my norm. Especially when it comes to chicken. I didn't rate it a 5 star because it slows up a little too often and freezes on occasion. Also some of the recipes require you to go through two more websites before u get the directions.
12414,12414,5,2014-05-06T14:15:40.000Z,The Gathering Garden,Best app! Will use daily.,This app is the best! Type in an ingredient and get an extensive list of delish recipes and reviews. I will use this everyday to spice up my menu. If you are tired of making the same things try this app and get inspired to try new recipes. Pictures are gorgeous. Easy to use.

12417,12417,3,2017-04-14T02:11:22.000Z,Baileyib,Repetitive recipes,"This app seems great at first: very customizable and aesthetically pleasing. The problem is that I see the same recipes in every category. Where is the variety? Another thing is that if you click on a certain category, like vegan, it'll just give you a bunch of drinks. Yeah, they're technically vegan, but I'm looking for food. It's the same with certain ethnic cuisines. Annoying."
12418,12418,4,2017-05-28T02:37:21.000Z,Appnotic,Endless Recipes,This app has a lot of recipes. You can search recipes based on main ingredients which is quite useful. The variety of ingredients is quite awesome. I've tried new recipes that have introduced me to a new family meal which is perfect since I'm always looking to make something out of the ordinary.

Few days later I received an email from them about cauliflower breadsticks, which looked good, so I clicked it to open in the app to see the actual recipe and all the App did repeatedly, four times, was open up the App Store to a casino app to download. After a few attempts, I was able to access the settings section of the app and signed out. It then asked me to rate it...big mistake! Junk app with way too many bugs and redirects to unwanted apps."

One annoying thing is that the recipes don't stay open if the phone goes to sleep, however, I think that encourages users to open the recipe in safari and I assume it's better for the recipe authors to get visits to their websites."

I didn't think much of this at first, but being a gluten free cook, I'm always on the lookout for tasty GF recipes.

It would only crash and crash and crash. You have no idea how frustrated I am with this because I loved this app. I loved everything about this app. I have tried deleting it and redownloading but it didn't work. This newest update said that there would be 6 and 6+ compatibility but alas it still doesn't work!"
12434,12434,5,2015-11-14T19:34:58.000Z,tpal020,Very helpful app,"Love this app! Especially the recipe to shopping list feature. It is a huge timesaver. The pictures are especially helpful and the social media integration is appreciated. It would be great if you could add a feature that allows Yummly ""friends"" to share recipes."
12435,12435,3,2015-12-01T22:26:20.000Z,ppcritters,Very Helpful,I mostly use the shopping list portion. Would have given more stars except it could use more categories. I.e. Canned goods so I don't have to put canned corn under vegetables. The recipe part is good except sometimes the recipe won't load because it is connected to a website. Particularly annoying when it's one you've used before and want to use again.
12436,12436,5,2015-12-20T16:42:17.000Z,wvueers1,Great App,I have tried several recipe idea apps over the past couple of years and Yummly has consistently suggested great recipe ideas.  And the email suggestions are not clutter. I do not instantly delete them because they have great suggestions in them as well.
12437,12437,5,2017-01-02T18:31:27.000Z,J-ReyNJ,My go to place for meal planning,Great app for when you want to try something new or when you've had a request for something specific and need a recipe. Also great for planning a special menu. It's my go to place when I need to get inspiration.
12438,12438,4,2017-01-08T03:45:51.000Z,Phi six,A-,"Would like it to make suggestions more diverse. If you like 1 recipe, then it always suggests the same dish. I've pretty much seen most of that specific dish, that's why I selected it.  Now show me others recipes I might be interested in. Example: I liked a ""rib"" recipe after tons of research in the app, then later it suggests noting but ""rib"" recipes to try. Dude?"
12439,12439,5,2017-01-16T22:06:49.000Z,thepookinator,Many recipes all in one app,"Yummly is easy to use, and has access to thousands of free recipes. You can save recipes locally to your profile, which makes personalizing easy. I highly recommend this app if you often struggle to figure out what's for dinner."
12440,12440,5,2013-10-20T04:26:54.000Z,Simplykk,My new favorite food app!,It is well designed and easy to use. I love the pictures that go with the recipes also. I tried my first recipe tonight and it was given five stars by my family. I will definitely use this wonderful app again and again!
12441,12441,5,2013-10-24T20:10:00.000Z,Kait2848,Creative easy recipes & beautiful pics,I'm so happy I found this app. It's easier to use than other food apps. See a recipe you like and in one tap it is saved to your favorite recipes. This will be useful when trying to think of meals to cook for the week.
12442,12442,4,2014-01-21T21:38:00.000Z,Bug041480,Pretty good,"I love having a recipe app on my phone for quick reference. I do have a suggestion: When we add something to our yums, we should be able to add notes to it. I made something recently but made some adjustments and didn't want to forget next time but there wasn't anywhere to make notes!!"

I also love the shopping list, you can add your own needs as well as things from the recipes you've ""yummed"""

I cannot find where one can ""add an ingredient"" to their recipe search on the app. If Yummly had this on their app, I'd be more likely to use it more often."
12447,12447,5,2014-10-06T19:40:12.000Z,BiggBoss,Best Food App??!!,"I personally think this is one of the best food Apps for iOS today to date. It is a great companion app for the website and also as a standalone app. I'm young and I'm making a real effort to try to eat healthy and this app makes finding recipes for nutrition easy. Give it a Try, it's Free!"

I am gluten-free and a vegetarian and it is my first year living in an apartment/cooking on my own. This app enables me to come up with yummy and creative dishes that my friends can enjoy as well, the instructions come with all the ingredients you need so cooking is no rocket science! I LOVE this app!!!"
12449,12449,5,2015-03-31T16:32:03.000Z,Mclineken27,Vegan friendly!,"As a newer member of the vegan community, I was at somewhat of a loss at the kind of meals I could have that were not only meatless but dairy free. This app has been insanely helpful and I couldn't imagine some of the creative vegan recipes they have. I also LOVE the idea of savings meals in different groups"
12450,12450,5,2013-09-16T06:02:22.000Z,SuzShultz,App makes discovering new recipes so fun!,I downloaded the app & within seconds it was showing me so many delicious recipes!

It is very easy and convenient for me to use, and searching for recipes is easy as pie. I would highly recommend this app for anyone who likes cooking and is tired of the same old food day in and day out!"
12453,12453,5,2015-05-24T06:35:50.000Z,Elveecee,Useful and intuitive,This app is completely worthwhile--it's layout and overall user experience is much phone-friendlier than using the browser site. The shopping list function in particular has proved useful.
12454,12454,5,2016-04-08T00:36:14.000Z,.jeffro,The best recipe app,"I love this app. It's great for clipping recipes you find on the web. It's great at suggesting recipes. It displays the recipes beautiful. Searching works perfectly. And best of all, it asks you for your dietary preferences and then 100% respects your choice, NEVER showing you things you don't want to see. Yummly FTW."
12455,12455,5,2016-11-09T00:24:47.000Z,Spilledink19,"Convenient, varied, beautiful","Not only is there a nearly endless selection of recipes, but they're presented in an aesthetically pleasing way and it's easy to navigate the app and save things you like. This app makes me hungry all the time, and it's given me the courage to try to make new foods."
12456,12456,5,2016-11-17T02:09:21.000Z,savsav826,Love this!!,"I am so glad I found this app. Seriously so cool and so customizable. Although, I am on a iPhone 6s Plus, things are a little stretched out on the app and doesn't seem to really fit that well but it's not that big of a deal. Will be recommending to friends and family :)"
12457,12457,5,2017-01-16T02:58:44.000Z,YoungChiefInTraining,Love to cook,I love love love this app. Actually cooking the foods and having my family try them has been a blessing for me to give to them. I especially like the different recipes that I can pick from and if I don't like one I still have others to choose from!

Found this app and it is making it easy for me to find alternative tasty easy healthy recipes. This 30 day challenge I started will turn into a life changing diet thanks in part to Yummly
12459,12459,5,2017-09-08T02:13:18.000Z,Parkes124,My go to idea/recipe app,"I love scrolling through this app for ideas. Pictures are helpful in catching my eye with something I'm craving. I can just input an ingredient I have, and work with that to start. Useful when preparing the dish; love that some people post their variations to try as well."
12460,12460,3,2013-10-13T21:34:12.000Z,RowerOne,Needs work,This app is really great looking. But my shopping list is never saved. Every time I turn my screen off on my phone the app insta-crashes forcing me to reload my shopping list.
12461,12461,2,2014-01-21T22:26:02.000Z,Perhaps perhaps perhaps,Umm,"Beautiful app with pretty pictures and it's fairly intuitive to use, and I'd give it high marks if not for one HUGE problem. You have to click on the recipe to see its full title. Stupid and inefficient. There's definitely room. Instead you end up scrutinizing the photos, trying to figure out if that darkish splotch is something you like or something you hate. All the pix means it doesn't load super fast, so that back and forth is very irritating."
12462,12462,5,2014-03-19T01:31:20.000Z,Gl1tt3rK1tt3n,Love the organization!,"Great app for recipes. Love being able to organize my favorites and as vegan, I love being able to go ahead and set that as a filter. Also like that it's is broken down into ingredients, nutrition and directions. My new favorite app to pass the time."
12463,12463,4,2014-08-10T16:39:13.000Z,Munch-a-bunch,A lot of interesting recipes!,"Love the diversity of recipes. I have been looking for more recipes featuring vegetables in various ways and the website did not disappoint. My only complaint, and it is minor, that sometimes the links to the various websites housing the recipes don't work.  It is rare, but it has happened to me 2‚Äì3 times."
12464,12464,5,2014-12-07T20:53:33.000Z,Jbrasssssss___,Love this app,"Such a great app. Does everything that I want it to do. Great search functionality, simple and easy interface, and even a shopping cart function that aggregates all of the ingredients from the  recipes that you use into one list. 5 star, 100%"

Now I just type in an ingredient and an hour later dinner is on the table. Definitely takes the stress out of what to cook or if I need to substitute an ingredient or want to make from scratch. Keep up this amazing app!!"

12472,12472,1,2015-01-04T16:50:35.000Z,starkitty13,Needs to be a LOT better,"On first use, this app is actually pretty good. You can search for recipes and add ingredients to a shopping list. But the dietary preferences are limiting and don't offer many choices. I tried searching for cauliflower Mac and cheese recipe. There are a ton of recipes out there but this app couldn't find even one! That's ridiculous! And I could barely find any recipes for LCHF. If they could allow importing of recipes from the web and meal planning this app would be a much better."

I love that it lists number of ingredients before I even open the recipe because I do 10 or less ingredients only!  Also, it's so easy to change the number of servings, and make a grocery list!"
12476,12476,4,2015-04-25T12:55:58.000Z,Wasted money!!,My favorite recipe app,"This is my favorite place to find clean recipes. There's so many paleo, gluten free, high protein, and whole food recipes to choose from and save."

I wish I'd get new recipes more often, as they often recycle the same old ones over and over. Hey folks! If I haven't ""yummed"" it and I've seen it four times, I'm probably not going to! But aside from that, very convenient and useful. A favorite of mine."

12479,12479,5,2016-04-01T11:14:08.000Z,Mamabird's Nest,Highly recommend,I love this app. I search and read recipes daily. I'm very inspired by the variations of common comfort foods.  I also like the search because you can list items you have on hand and find recipes to use them in a new way.

Meals at my house will be more creative now that I've got a decent selection of recipes mixed in with inspirational photos all at my fingertips!  And grocery shopping will be so much more efficient as well. Genius!!!
12481,12481,5,2015-07-14T02:39:44.000Z,RoadWarrior2004,Awesome!,"The most bestest, awesomest, unbeatablest, comprehensivest, and coolest app! If only it would provide pictures of ingredients as it is hard to identify sometimes the herbs, cuts, legimes, etc AND if recipe directions would be in uniform style without taking you to different sites - it would be most unbelievablest!"

I cook like Wolfgang Puck when I'm prepping for the beautiful women that come over. And on football Sunday all my bros come over and we eat 5 star dishes like the pros we watch. I highly recommend!!!!

It's easy to use and works very well. I highly recommend it to anyone that just needs a few good ideas and is comfortable around the kitchen.
12486,12486,2,2016-11-03T21:32:42.000Z,Sdmick,Bad programming changes,"Generally, I love this app. However, it's suffers from programming issues. In the newest version on the computer you can no longer search your recipe box. Ridiculous!  I have over 200 recipes saved and no way to search them. Yummly knows about the problem but it will likely take months to fix. Pretty sad they can't get their act together and maintain the functionality."

I'm new to the whole cooking for myself by myself thing and this app has helped me learn to do basic recipes and not so basic recipes with ease.

Sometimes I have everything on hand for pancakes and when I don't, I know yummly will come thru with some delicious options."
12504,12504,5,2015-10-13T03:13:13.000Z,Master4407,The best app ever,I've got a food allergy to both milk and eggs and yummly has amazing great recipes that don't have either of those ingredients added and also you can change the serving size and it will account for it in how much to put in your recipes.
12505,12505,5,2015-11-19T01:44:18.000Z,SarahFann,Can't live without it!!!!!!,Cannot say enough about how easy this app is to use & how often it comes in handy for preparing meals from easy with few ingredients to vegetarian to  complex and detailed recipes. We use this almost every night
12506,12506,5,2015-11-22T22:49:01.000Z,Jessica‚ô•,The best app ever.,I recommend this app to every single person I meet. I love to cook with this app. I myself am a vegan and it's constantly feeding me awesome new recipes!! I love that it has a built in grocery list that you can add things to. It's super well organized and very well done. Round of applause.

12509,12509,4,2016-12-12T03:07:33.000Z,TaradiseinTn,Very useful,I like the search function for this app so you can search by ingredients pretty easily.  I also like the calorie breakdown how it lists the ingredients in the beginning so you have a preview before you look at the recipe.
12510,12510,5,2013-11-14T21:03:13.000Z,Poopfacecumtlicker,Love yummly!!!,"Yummly is the best place to find recipes, it takes just seconds to find a recipe to either match your ingredients, or any recipe you want to find. Don't know what you want? Yummly does. Yum things and it will give you suggestions based off of your choices!"

In the few months I have had this app I have looked up and made over 50 different recipes. I highly recommend this to everyone from beginner cooks to advanced ones .
12514,12514,4,2014-06-22T13:51:57.000Z,Ashplunderer,Great App,I love this app! As an avid cook this app is my go to menu creator! 1 thing I would like to see is where you could enter what ingredients you have available and the app make suggestions based on that data. Other than that this app is as near to perfect as it could be. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars!
12515,12515,5,2014-09-22T14:36:04.000Z,Runweeny,Best and most visited app i have,I love the large variety of all kinds of recipes I now have access too and the how well organized it is set up!! I also really like the the option of organizing my favorite recipes into saved categories.

It is so easy to search for the exact recipe you want, and then easily add the ingredients to a ""grocery list"" within the app!"
12517,12517,4,2015-03-07T20:00:36.000Z,hoy magandangbuhay,Grand-excellent cooking app!!‚úÖüòÄ,"I really this app a lot. It helps me get new ideas on what to prep for dinner/menu for the day or week.  Only thing is that, depending on the recipe- when clicking on the directions, it goes to another website. Which maybe they can improve on instead of this route."
12518,12518,5,2017-02-06T21:54:26.000Z,RekaRoddy,Truly Yummy,Loving this app! Lots and lots of great recipes from many sources. The app itself is easy to navigate and allows you to search for specific recipes or search for new ideas when you really don't know what to make for dinner.
12519,12519,5,2017-06-05T17:52:17.000Z,Sujinja,Awesome App,"You can create filters if you want recipes with no cheese, etc. I love this app. It's really organized and is a great way to get better at cooking, but also for those that have been cooking for years and just want to try a different recipe."

I have and will continue to recommend this to anyone with even the smallest interesting in cooking!"

This is my second time ever reviewing something so you know it's good. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys eating. So everyone.
12522,12522,5,2016-02-21T06:06:23.000Z,laurenepopp,Great food inspiration,"I used to swear by Pinterest, but for recipes yummly is the absolute best. No dead links and spam, no single link duplicated a million times. Just awesome recipes linked from different sites and food blogs. Not to mention they help you build a shopping list."

12524,12524,5,2016-06-19T12:43:29.000Z,Dixbrat,Yum Yum Yummly!,I absolutely love this app. I find myself going to this app to find dinner ideas when I'm just plan sick of cooking the same old things. I also pull this app up when I'm being just a tad bit lazy and don't want to run to the store to pick up any thing. üëçüèæüëçüèæüëçüèæüëçüèæ
12525,12525,4,2016-08-05T23:07:47.000Z,vaeringeir,Two Thumbs Up,"Always really liked this app, the recipes are great and I love having things suggested in the feed. Only problem is that it doesn't always save my dietary preferences, so I keep seeing recipes heavily involving, say, tomatoes but I can't eat them. Not a huge problem but a little annoying."
12526,12526,5,2016-09-19T03:19:24.000Z,Kuledude123,Great app!!,"I LOVE this app! It's my ""go to"" when I want to try out new recipes or change up ones I already make. I have one request though - can you add a ""favorites"" button so the recipes that I've made can be accessed easily? Thanks for doing a great job!"
12527,12527,4,2016-10-29T17:18:04.000Z,Blanwell,Nice overall,App itself is great for finding recipes and then adding to your grocery list. Super easy.
12528,12528,5,2016-12-04T17:59:05.000Z,SteeleInMusic,Blown Away,Fantastic in almost every way. You can tell they spent real money on the design and execution of this app. Well thought out and beautiful to use. I'm impressed and I hate almost everything. Still hate the name Yummly but I'm over it. This app is too good.

Probably not a day goes by that I don't use this excellent app. I love to be able to search for some ingredient I want to use and find so many amazing recipes.

12554,12554,4,2015-08-09T14:48:23.000Z,Justin Davis,Nearly perfect app,I use Yummly all the time for cooking and baking inspiration. I'm a complete novice but using Yummly has really made me excited to cook and bake for my family on a regular basis. Great app! I would like to have the ability to add comments or modifications to recipes I've tried etc. other than that nearly perfect.

12560,12560,2,2016-02-06T20:54:07.000Z,Jogdtgvcj,Forcing people to download your app is shady and pathetic,"As a consumer, I hate it when businesses force people to do things that's completely UNNECESSARY! I tried to get a recipe on the Yummly site from my mobile device."
12561,12561,4,2016-02-08T03:09:34.000Z,Esinahs,Sleek Design,The design of this app is definitely more unique and organized than other apps but my only problem is that sometimes it takes a while for your favorited recipes to show as favorited. Regardless of that I love the app and seeing recipes I've never seen before.

So convenient! The only thing I'd say that you could make this app better (and earn five stars, in my book) is to make it compatible with MyFitnessPal so I can log my calories easier. Pretty please? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
12569,12569,5,2017-03-04T13:39:07.000Z,CarrieD23,Easy to use,It's very easy to search with a ton of options for any kind of dish. I also like that other users can review a recipe to give you a better idea which to choose. It has become one of my go to recipe apps üòä
12570,12570,4,2013-10-18T16:26:59.000Z,Lsimmons1048,Pictures will make you want to salt your screen.,"Great app beautiful pics. A couple of the recipes don't have directions that was the only bad thing. But the had all the ingredients listed and once you put the ingredients together, with moderate cooking experience they worked out."
12571,12571,5,2014-02-10T21:57:08.000Z,B toto,Love this app,"There are so many different options and categories to find the perfect meal on this app. I have to eat specific foods so the preference option is very handy and with many options. Also, the option for the type of cuisine (I.e. American, Mexican, Italian) is nice."
12572,12572,4,2014-11-09T19:04:25.000Z,Jaztutz,Great app; customization could make it better,"Great app that aggregates from many different websites. You can even add recipes from websites that yummly doesn't have, but you can't add photos. So I have a bunch of recipes with no photos. Good integration w PC. wish you could print directly from the yummly recipe page."
12573,12573,5,2015-03-05T03:18:49.000Z,Ellejaeque,Simplifies grocery shopping too,Very nice to be able to access all of your recipes in one place. This is especially handy when at the grocery store and you need to double check your ingredients
12574,12574,4,2015-05-02T03:20:11.000Z,Mind0fmyown,Best Food App Yet,"This has been the best recipe app I've ever had! Yummly is sleek yet user friendly setup. There are pictures, dietary info, and directions (not to mention you can customize your food selection). The only downfall for me is that the app will sometimes crash (I will say though I have an old iPhone 4)."

It has beautiful images of the food and an easy way to categorize food.  With that said, I wish this app had the ability to share menus with another person to streamline and coordinate dinner menus with two busy adults."
12577,12577,5,2017-01-22T23:42:10.000Z,Nat 8965,Favorite,Such a wonderful app I use it all the time !!!! The best is not only does it let you know what to eat health wise but it also tells you the food times so when I am on the go I know what to find if I need to only make a 15 minute meal
12578,12578,5,2017-03-04T05:48:34.000Z,heythatstiny,Love,This app gives me so many recipe ideas...I'm actually on a diet and they have so many recipes of detox drinks that I actually use along with healthy cooking options...my kids love the fun recipes which all involve sugar but hey they're kids!!! The slow cook recipes are Devine..this app is awesome sauce
12579,12579,4,2017-06-05T17:29:28.000Z,Pegro123,Almost a five!,"I love the recipes and being able to search by several categories. It seems to jump around a lot and I often see something that catches my eye and I can't get back to it. Otherwise, it's user friendly and easy to save recipes."
12580,12580,2,2015-07-25T07:55:53.000Z,Misterfaust,"Great content, but flawed","Navigation is not very intuitive. I found myself accidentally tapping random links and would have no way to get back to what I was initially looking at without going to the actual website and tapping the ""take me to the app"" button. When I finally got back to the recipe, it told me to ""watch the video"".... There wasn't one. Still, great content, just not very user friendly."
12581,12581,5,2015-09-26T23:51:04.000Z,BabyLawyer,Great app for meal planning,"This app is easy to use and has made meal planning a breeze.  I love that I can search for easy, healthy recipes that meet my family's dietary restrictions (kids with allergies and a picky husband).  My family loves going a month without repeat dinners."
12582,12582,5,2015-10-08T00:19:02.000Z,I can't live without the drop!,It's okay,"I love everything about this app, except for the fact that every time I push the back arrow it closes the app!!!!!!!!! This is soooo frustrating!!!!!! I literally almost want to delete the app because of this problem!"
12583,12583,5,2015-11-05T16:48:49.000Z,JesImd31,App not working after update!,App freezing after clicking on a recipe after updating today. Can't look at ingredients or directions. Please fix as I usually like this app and look up recipes all the time!
12584,12584,5,2015-12-10T03:57:34.000Z,Hestis,Used Daily !!!!,I love this app and what it has to offer. The resource of recipes seems endless. I enjoy cooking all different ethnic foods. When I'm looking for different recipes from other countries they are easy to find. This app is very user friendly.
12585,12585,5,2016-03-12T04:07:48.000Z,Ms. KayFBaby,I love it!!!,"This app is awesome! Whenever I have ingredients at home and don't have a recipe in mind, I punch it in the search bar and get a ton of great ideas! I downloaded this app because I grew tired of feeding my family the same rotation of meals. With Yummly, I get to change it up. üòä"
12586,12586,5,2016-03-27T03:22:38.000Z,MIA Kitsune,My mobile recipe book,Love the app; shopping list adds are easy to do and you can find almost anything your palate might crave; wish I could add recipe notes but other than that it's one of my favorite food apps
12587,12587,5,2016-04-24T14:06:29.000Z,Ks11111,Must have app,I used the recipe for husbands German chocolate cake from this site. Everyone absolutely loved it. Tried many different recipes from this site all excellent. I love the different variations offered when you search a specific recipes.
12588,12588,5,2016-11-23T16:41:40.000Z,fantastickkay,Useful and user friendly,"So many great choices. The main things I like are that you can personalize which types of recipes you see, put those recipes into categories, and import the nutritional info into the Health app"
12589,12589,5,2016-12-27T21:05:20.000Z,Krivo77,Great app,Lots of delicious üòã recipes.  Loads of features inside the app. Especially like the shopping list feature. Oh and I love pictures üì∏.
12590,12590,4,2014-03-08T01:26:09.000Z,alison self,great app,I really enjoy this app! a few things I think would make it better:
12591,12591,5,2014-04-23T21:42:49.000Z,Nbababavasv,Unbelievable App! Best hands down!,"I don't typically rate apps at all.  This app deserves every bit of the 5 star.  Its user friendly, easy follow, organized and most all its great for shopping with.  Hands down best app on my phone!"
12592,12592,5,2014-09-10T21:56:18.000Z,YouKnoMe2,I FEEL LIKE A CHEF!!!!!!,"Ever since I've used this app, every dish that I've cooked has been some of the best dishes I've prepared. I consider myself a good cook, but this app has made me better! I have improvised a lot of dishes and my family have been impressed and enjoyed everything I've cooked!! Great app!"
12593,12593,3,2014-12-06T05:17:46.000Z,Emma G 23,Something for every taste,I like this app and use it by picking out a main ingredient for my fridge and seeing what it finds. Many options allows you to pick a recipe that's ingredients are in your cupboards. The only downfall is that once your phone locks and you try to come back to the recipe it automatically jumps back to the top of the page.
12594,12594,5,2015-03-12T03:58:07.000Z,Da bawz,Must-try,"The interface on this app is beautifully designed and the recipes look delicious and are well-organized in a logical manner. I usually consider apps in the food/cooking/recipes category ""junk"" but this one's definitely a keeper"
12595,12595,4,2015-03-14T05:14:17.000Z,Shelles‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Belles,üòä,"So far I'm really enjoying this app. A lot of awesome recipes to fit my lifestyle :) I love the ""filters"" feature which allows you to only see recipes that are customized to your own personal diet guidelines... Only thing I'd like to suggest... Is perhaps allowing yummly to be able to sync with myfitnesspal ... That would be awesome!"
12596,12596,4,2015-03-30T18:41:49.000Z,patworx,"My most ""go to"" for recipes","Like any other app, it could use some improvements. Most apps are not perfect and need much improvement. But, it works pretty well. If I don't like how a website displays a recipe, I will just go and print it out. Sometimes, the printed version is so much better."
12597,12597,5,2015-06-16T17:51:36.000Z,24x7mom,Outstanding,"Love, love, love this App. As an avid cook, I'm always looking for new recipes. I used to use Food Network or my cookbooks, but now this is my go to helper. I really like that I can search on a specific ingredient. And I like that I can look up My Yums on my computer as well."
12598,12598,5,2017-02-25T19:30:50.000Z,Tara - Sarah,This is my favorite cooking app,This is such a cool app! I mainly use Yum and Pinterest as my go to apps. Yum especially great for recipes and I can pull it up where ever I am traveling to when I'm wanting to whip up some great dishes at friend houses around the globe! There are so many amazing recipes. Love it!
12599,12599,5,2017-08-29T02:10:19.000Z,KaiKaiMari,Love browsing these recipes!,"I have a blast looking at new recipes and love to save ideas for later. Everything I've made has been great, and when I search for ideas I almost always find what I'm looking for."
12600,12600,5,2015-04-25T14:54:22.000Z,Meadowtree,I use this app constantly,I turn to this app about every day. The emails are always inspiring and I have made so many original categories in my Yuma If you don't want to be creative and adventurous with your cooking this is the one to have.
12601,12601,5,2015-05-06T19:32:25.000Z,applesauce megee,Good app easy simple to use,Was Impressed by this app very effective If I need a quick recipe wip out my phone that easy.. There's search criteria to help narrow down my selection for certain dishes. Overall great app with easy mechanics and a simple design 5 stars
12602,12602,5,2015-07-29T22:35:32.000Z,Melissa G G,Mel,"I opened the app up and I just can't get enough WOW I AM AMAZED!! My family is going to eat better meals all around, I was so sick and tired of cooking the same old things now we can all sit down together and decided what we are going to eat, I am very impressed!!"
12603,12603,5,2015-09-06T14:48:06.000Z,Cj3457864456,Only One Thing...,I'd like to request a few additional search filters:
12604,12604,5,2015-11-30T21:56:37.000Z,Sailee,Great app to filter recipes for allergies,"I love this app! The diversity of recipes is amaizing, but my favorite feature is how well it filters to your family's needs. Need a dairy free recipe? Gluten free recipe for the play date this afternoon? You got it! I love it! It's my go to app for recipes! Keep up the awesome work yummly!"
12605,12605,5,2016-02-15T06:55:17.000Z,Brewha83,Very helpful,I love looking on here for specific ideas and needs. It's very helpful and fun to just browse through all the different recipes. I look at it almost daily. Have told my family and friends about it.
12606,12606,5,2016-03-07T01:37:28.000Z,Quarter Bend,Great for planning meals and shopping!,My wife has specific dietary requirements and I used to struggle to find stuff that we could of both eat. This app is perfect for her restrictions and makes shopping and planning for the week very easy.
12607,12607,5,2016-08-22T18:33:18.000Z,ChrissyCrook,Absolutely love this app!,I love trying out new recipes and being able to search for recipes with items on hand is awesome! Been so easy to access recipes again We have loved with the Yum feature!
12608,12608,5,2017-01-16T00:29:00.000Z,Mims648392,Love this app!,"This app is great and easy to use. It counts calories, tells the number of ingredients in each recipe, time to prep and cook. Ratings are pretty accurate to how the food tastes. I've already recommended the app to multiple friends and they love it as well!"
12609,12609,5,2017-02-10T23:08:48.000Z,Amarlia,User friendly,I like that I can find recipe ideas and also read comments and suggestions which adds to get ideas or parts of the recipe that can be changed.
12610,12610,3,2014-02-01T11:32:14.000Z,053phil,Great for random things to make,I find this is a great app to find random ideals and stuff to try. When I do search for something (i.e. rye bread) I get a bunch of recipes using the item but not ones to make my own. Sometimes just easier to search the web and find what I want than to use this app when it is a specific thing.
12611,12611,3,2014-02-08T12:56:31.000Z,mama-papa,"Love the app, hate the account sign-in","A great app for recipes and inspiration in the kitchen! Search feature is great, as well. However, I have neither a Facebook or Google account.  So, it seems I am not worthy enough of the app's full functionality. It would be nice to be able to creat a direct account with Yummly, rather than use an existing one with a third party."
12612,12612,5,2014-03-19T01:20:47.000Z,Not cooker,Easy and useful,I don't like cooking and this app makes things easier for me. I can find easy recipes that are super yummy in no time without having to search cookbooks or the internet. A plus for anyone who likes or dislikes cooking.
12613,12613,4,2014-04-28T00:57:33.000Z,College age kid,Love it,"Very intuitive app interface, I only wish the names of the recipes would stay while you scroll and not disappear if your finger is not physically scrolling, otherwise beautiful pictures, easy to use ingredient section, and great recipes! Just need more recipes now!"
12614,12614,5,2014-07-11T07:24:25.000Z,Jay -One,Awesome app,Great ideas. Each time you open the app it gives you new ideas based upon what you have told it in the past you liked. Some have videos to help you along! Plus I like the grocery list!
12615,12615,5,2014-07-22T19:55:58.000Z,Jules0077,Amazing!!,"This app is way better than the Food Network one. More variety of recipes, although some don't have the instructions, but for the most part, all the recipes are very well structured. My favorite cooking app so far!"
12616,12616,5,2014-10-17T00:13:27.000Z,Ryan Linton,Amazing app for food lovers,It's incredible how similar this app is to one I dreamt of years ago. A dream that got me started programming. I didn't gain the skills I needed fast enough though. Yummly is just too perfect. I guess I'll have to build something else now. Thanks guys!
12617,12617,5,2015-01-25T18:27:02.000Z,Jearold,Useful tool for wannabe chefs,My family is vegetarian so finding new use of favorite veggies and finding ideas for meals can be a challenge. I've found some recipes in here that have become faves. The grocery checklist feature is very helpful.
12618,12618,5,2017-07-30T14:01:20.000Z,Dknjoh,Great recipe finder and cooking app!,Not only a great way to find recipes but this app has great instructions for cooking those recipes. Very tailorable to various dietary needs or restrictions (like allergies). You can also filter recipes by how long it takes to prepare and methods of cooking.
12619,12619,5,2017-08-20T22:40:50.000Z,RootBear & Lil‚Äô Buddy,Awesome enough to get me to write!,"I usually don't review apps. I'm rarely compelled enough- either by love or hate- to make the effort. But I love Yummly. It's a great resource- especially if you love to cook. It also makes shopping easy with the ""add to shopping list"" feature."
12620,12620,5,2015-04-30T04:56:52.000Z,Healthyyy,Best cooking app!,"I'm taking my time to write this review because of the nothing but pleasant experience I have had with Yummly. Limited ads, personalized recipes, custom shopping list and ease of use are just a few qualities to name. Can't stop raving about it!"
12621,12621,5,2015-05-01T00:56:39.000Z,DoubleYumMe,"Like, but...","Really like getting all the fabulous recipes but I wish there was a way to mark ones I've actually made and enjoyed---something like a ""double yum"" button. (I use the Yum tag to select ones I want to make.)"
12622,12622,4,2015-06-10T00:25:30.000Z,Subi11,A great resource,"I enjoy this app and find it helpful in my quest to declutter. Instead of having pages of printed recipes, I can just save good looking stuff to the app. I do wish that there was a way to record comments to myself about the recipe, like substitutions I tried or how long it too to cook in my oven."
12623,12623,5,2015-06-10T04:06:30.000Z,Larrrrryyyyyy,Very good app!,This app is addicting for anybody that is looking for new recipes to try. Gives you all the ingredients needed and even tells you the nutrition content of the foods! I would highly recommend this app to anyone as it is very addicting!!
12624,12624,4,2015-11-17T21:53:17.000Z,Trade high,Very resourceful and packed with cool interesting recipes!,I really enjoy this app because it has lots of different recipes and gives a variety of options for all kinds of dishes! It's really awesome also how you are able to choose exactly what kind of search you want to use.
12625,12625,4,2016-06-14T01:47:47.000Z,EagMed,Helpful and user-friendly,"I like how easy it is to find recipes from multiple sources and organize them. I think they've also fixed that problem where you lose your spot in the recipe of the phone goes to sleep, which is nice."
12626,12626,5,2016-08-05T15:06:28.000Z,MDERPHAJH,Yum Yummly!,Yummly encompasses recipes from a wide variety of cultures. Culinary skills required range from basic to advanced. I love planning meals on my phone at the grocery store then preparing the food with my tablet in the kitchen. Yummly makes it easy to share and store recipes also. It's awesome!
12627,12627,4,2016-11-13T21:05:41.000Z,Ain'tgotit,Really love IT,"I absolutely love this App. I love to cook and it gives me great ideas for different things to try. I always seem to use the same ingredients the same way all the time. So, with this app I can type in one ingredient and get tons of great recipes. Only thing is it's a little complicated at first!"
12628,12628,5,2017-02-09T15:29:34.000Z,S_h_559,Best recipe app ever,"Everything you can think of to cook is right here in this app. The recipes are easy to follow, so even if you are a beginner you can use this app. No more searching the web for a recipe...you can find pretty much any recipe in this app."

All my friends love the recipes I've made from here. I do wish it gave the option to filter recipes by food group, meal type, ingredients, etc."
12631,12631,2,2014-01-22T17:58:38.000Z,Glopro1,Has potential...,"This app had so much potential for me... Until I saw the nutrition content tracks fat, carbs, and some vitamins, but not protein?  Why track only two of the three caloric bases and not include the most essential for a lot of people?  Essentially makes this app unhelpful in keeping a balanced intake."
12632,12632,5,2014-03-10T19:14:07.000Z,Rayette-Cruz,THE BEST RECIPE APP!!,I love this App!! I can find any recipe on here! And it is a very easy app to use.

I love the ideas that it churns out with one simple word ""orzo."" Great app for anyone that cooks but specifically those normally intimidated by cooking"
12636,12636,5,2014-08-25T17:09:28.000Z,Katherine Dechert,Great App!,I have already made 3 recipes I found on yummly (and I only downloaded a few days ago). Wide variety of recipes from vegetarian to buffalo turkey meatballs. Everything I search seems to have at least a few results. Very fun!

This app organizes and let's you choose what makes sense for your taste and then makes suggestions. It is pandora for recipes.  Easy to navigate, quick glance information, and a search feature...LOVE it!"
12638,12638,5,2015-04-29T21:24:16.000Z,Fergie poops,Great app good for Apple watch users,I really like how pleasing this app is to the eye.
12639,12639,3,2017-05-22T14:51:18.000Z,Working mama1008,Pretty pics but inaccurate ingredient lists when compared to actual recipe,The ingredient list (specifically quantities) sometimes differs from what is listed on the app quick view and the recipe's home website. It is a little bit of a pain to always have to go to the recipe's website to correctly make the recipe.
12640,12640,5,2015-11-09T15:25:58.000Z,Aring16,LOVE,"I recommend this app to everyone - it has every type of food and meal type you can imagine, from gourmet desserts to back yard BBQ platters to gluten free entrees. I use it everyday and all the recipes I have tried on here work too! Absolutely worth the download :)"

12644,12644,5,2016-09-30T15:40:02.000Z,Arbit93,Love this app!,Best app I have found. There are so many recipes to choose from and it is really catered to your personal preferences. I love that you can list ingredients that you dislike and that the shopping list is so easy to use!
12645,12645,5,2017-01-01T14:58:26.000Z,Cakelady09,Always trying new recipes!,I love this app! I have found some great meals in a pinch just by searching simple recipes using the ingredients in my fridge as well as tried new ones that I never would have thought of.
12646,12646,5,2017-02-20T23:27:02.000Z,Stickpplrbeast,Great for dietary restrictions,"The search option is wonderful in that all of the hits are within dietary guidelines that you set. Which is convenient if you're trying to find a vegan cheese sauce you can simply search ""cheese sauce"" and only vegan recipes come up."
12647,12647,5,2017-02-28T16:48:36.000Z,Aubeewobley,THE BEST recipe app I've ever found,"I LOVE the shopping list and how if I have more than one recipe on there and the same ingredient in both, it groups them together so that I know the total of that ingredient for all recipes. I also love the options for diets and allergies..."

12653,12653,5,2014-07-13T14:32:36.000Z,Kendra Prince,Must have App,"This is a must have app if you are a fan of cooking and trying unique recipes. I do all my cooking from this app. With thousands of recipes to choose from, you will never have to cook the same thing twice."
12654,12654,5,2014-09-30T22:43:14.000Z,KristaHarris,The best app of all apps!!!,"Perfect for finding specific recipes, getting ideas for tonight's dinner, or a snack for right now!! Love that I can type in ""dinner for kids"" or ""low fat snack"" and tons of recipes pop up for me to choose from or save for later!"
12655,12655,4,2015-01-05T16:10:11.000Z,Naansequitur,Go-to recipe app,"I love Yummly! This is my go-to app any time I need a recipe. My only complaint is that there needs to be a way to copy the URL for recipes within the app. Currently, this is not an option in the ""share"" function. You have to open the recipe in Safari, then copy the link from there."
12656,12656,5,2015-01-26T14:04:19.000Z,Yum lover,A plus recipe app,Yum is a great way to try new things and i love the variety in the recipes! Also the filters are amazing because my friend is a vegan and i can never think of food to make when she comes over
12657,12657,4,2015-03-01T20:25:09.000Z,ElMDesigns,Really nice but recipes don't stay open,"Because the app is pulling recipes from all over the web, there isn't any set look/feel for what recipes look like. Tricky when you're trying to read directions off your phone while cooking"
12658,12658,5,2015-04-30T00:06:01.000Z,MadDogLane,Better than Pinterest!,Since downloading this app I have visited my Pinterest cooking boards much less frequently! I love having the nutrition information and times right there and the photos are amazing!
12659,12659,4,2015-08-10T13:41:22.000Z,Alie Lauren Design,Useful has a few bugs,"I like how you can add the ingredients easily to your shopping list from the recipe. Sometimes app shuts down or there can be a glitch while using the shopping list. However, I really like the app and would recommend."
12660,12660,5,2015-01-09T04:30:16.000Z,Demon space monkey,Hungry vegetarian,I love this app! So many vegetarian and vegan options. Regular food too of course. This app is so much easier to use then other food apps and you get a variety. I've recommended this app to a few friends. It's a must download.
12661,12661,4,2015-05-21T02:33:46.000Z,TangoRomeoBravo,Fun,I like the way you create a profile of the types of food you like so you don't have to sift thru a bunch of recipes you won't eat. Sometimes the app refreshes but doesn't show any new recipes though. Overall it's a fun app and I have recommended it to other Foodies like myself!
12662,12662,3,2016-01-17T03:00:56.000Z,Hunerdpercent,Would be amazing,"This would be an amazing app if it wasn't so bug filled. From signing me out randomly, not showing something I just saved, constantly resetting to the home screen, things not showing up where I categorized them, and on and on."
12663,12663,5,2016-11-17T01:28:09.000Z,Raminto,Top Notch,I like to cook but I get tired of the same old thing. This app delivers simple yet satisfying new ideas that are spot on for any occasion. I have actually found several ideas that are now family favorites.
12664,12664,5,2017-01-11T13:04:11.000Z,Wapaangelita,Great place to keep recipes!,I love that the app allows you to store the recipes in different folders for you to find later! I love using it with my watch so that I'm not constantly unlocking my phone while cooking!
12665,12665,5,2017-01-17T21:08:07.000Z,PlAnetmermaid,Simple. Easy. Tasty,"If I'm ever in a bind and don't have much time to cook a meal or can't think of anything, yummly is there to the rescue! They have amazing recipes that are easy to cook. I just type in an ingredient and Yummly gives me hundreds of recipes based on that 1 ingredient. I love it!"
12666,12666,1,2017-05-09T23:27:05.000Z,Dafort22,This app used to be great,"I just did an update to get some recipes for dinner tonight. There are so many pop up ads when you start reading about the directions and prep work it is absolutely unbelievable! As you're scrolling and reading everything will shift and you'll see an ad for something that has nothing to do with anything,totally inappropriate ad placement! I get there trying to make money but this is ridiculous."
12667,12667,5,2017-05-10T16:11:22.000Z,Ruhnahnah,Most used,I have downloaded so many recipe apps and I use this one the most. I also very much appreciate the emails sent with suggestions based on my Yums. Those emails have helped get dinner on the table and saves me from dinner routine ruts.
12668,12668,3,2017-06-13T23:05:13.000Z,Skurlo,Yummly,"I found some good recipes, but you need to scroll through photos and similar recipes to get to the directions. And when I tried to make something a second time I was constantly interrupted to write a review. I give it three stars for the recipes because the app lets me eliminate ingredients I don't like or don't want to use."
12669,12669,5,2017-07-22T19:09:20.000Z,MonBiggs,Love this app!,Fabulous and easy recipes for your food lifestyle.   I've tried so many recipes and always had good luck with each.  I also really like the nutritional info so that I can ensure I am staying true to my health goals.  Thank you Yummly!
12670,12670,1,2013-12-21T19:02:33.000Z,theUcane,NOT facebook/google,I'm in the *Yummly* app. Not facebook. Not google. I don't want to connect to those to use Yummly. This severely limits my experience & renders most of the features useless.
12671,12671,5,2014-04-18T12:55:28.000Z,Dostr4111,Great App!,I have downloaded other apps on cooking but this app beats them all. Food is always attractive when there is a visual presentation.  Yummly with their highly attractive photography makes cooking very enticing.  It is very easy to use and a great tool!  Thank you
12672,12672,5,2014-05-12T17:52:35.000Z,GillyBeanz1,The New Go To App,"App is great!  Great search features and I've found new sites I enjoy through this recipe tool. We'll organized and can log in from PC as well. Was better before the 'sponsored' items became prevalent, but I get that too."
12673,12673,5,2014-05-13T13:33:27.000Z,Ladife346,Updated version doesn't work,"When I first downloaded this app it work great and I loved it, however I updated it to the latest version and I can't not open the app now...please fix as I enjoyed using it"
12674,12674,5,2014-07-15T12:47:51.000Z,Kailayy,Great app!,I have been trying to live a healthier lifestyle and this app helps so much. It has meals and snacks for any time of day and you can filter the results to what you want in the meal like calories or stuff you don't like/ allergic to and ugh I love this app alot
12675,12675,5,2014-08-12T15:39:48.000Z,SassyChef86,Wonderful,This is a great app. Easy to use and works well. Makes it convenient to quickly look up recipes and get great meal ideas even when you're not in front of a computer (or cookbook).
12676,12676,5,2014-11-06T13:18:50.000Z,M_Monrow,I LOVE THIS APP!!!,I am cooking more at home and I find myself exploring new recipes! I've never attempted to make sauces before and this app really made it easy for me to try! I came out of my comfort zone and now my lunches and dinners are newer and fresher! Whoever created this is simply genius!

I never had any help learning how to cook but thank to Yummly I have become the chef for the boys. Thank you Yummly for the wonderful and so tasty recipes!!!"
12680,12680,5,2015-11-19T02:25:39.000Z,Iman M,Best one so far,I like the recipes. I like the way you browse and sort. I like how easy it is to add ingredients to your shopping list.
12681,12681,3,2015-12-04T20:13:02.000Z,Jannicep,It's not working! Please fix it!,"I have never had an issue with this app. But for some reason I opened it today and all my saved recipes are gone. The app ask me to sign in, but it's not recognizing my email and it's not opening through my fb neither."
12682,12682,5,2015-12-17T15:48:12.000Z,G1doc,Love this app!,This is a great app for people who like to try making different foods. The only thing I wish is that there was a way to add your own personal recipes so that you can share them with others.
12683,12683,5,2016-02-21T19:53:01.000Z,Ldyg88,Awesome app,Best recipe app I've had. I eat Paleo and I love that you can choose whatever diet you're on and it will cancel out the foods you shouldn't eat in the suggested recipes. You can also select any foods you don't like and it will do the same. Love it!
12684,12684,5,2016-03-05T00:43:21.000Z,Teak6,My go-to recipe AP!,"I cook for many people, with a variety of dietary restrictions. Yummy is fantastic because I can put in any ingredients and will find recipe options. I also love a portable ap where I can have everything conveniently on my phone."
12685,12685,5,2016-03-27T20:00:28.000Z,Rachelpanini,Makes cooking easy,"I love the way it has a different tab for ingredients, instructions, etc. Tells you calories. There are tons of easy recipes. It's really made cooking less daunting from start to finish."
12686,12686,4,2016-04-14T17:34:16.000Z,TKnowledge0731,Great App!,I've been using Yummly for around a year now and still finding new recipes. The crashes are minor and I wish they would add a barcode feature to check off what ingredients I have in home already. Over worth the time to download
12687,12687,5,2016-07-06T23:14:43.000Z,Kkoska,EXTREMELY USEFUL!,I probably use this for every other dinner/breakfast. The recipes on here are phenomenal and I can search for pretty much anything! I love to sit and just scroll through the recipes as well and save the ones I want to try.
12688,12688,5,2016-09-23T01:29:22.000Z,sj_shabrina,Helpful App for any cooking skill,"At home, I try my best to cook low carbs food and with this app I can choose how many carbs, fat, protein I want on the food. It also has more than you need choices of food so you can have meal plan, really easy."

12690,12690,2,2014-02-11T20:40:46.000Z,Horsekrazy,Great & Not,"The app is great, tons of ideas and features, very useful EXCEPT FOR ONE VERY BIG PROBLEM you have to connect to Facebook or Google to use almost all features of the app except the search function ... Would be a great app otherwise ... I am so sick of everything needed to connect to FB to be able to use it. I hate FB and don't feel the need to share my every moment with everyone or anyone."
12691,12691,5,2014-03-15T05:54:33.000Z,Metrosexualhipster,Motivational,"During my current, ""health kick"" this app provides me with the opportunity of looking at all of the savory foods I don't want to eat. That is until I beef up the muscle mass and I can increase my calorie intake, therefore expanding my food options."
12692,12692,5,2014-08-17T15:11:48.000Z,Busymomma27,LOVE this app,This app has saved me so any times. I get tired of cooking the same ways so all I do is type is certain ingredients and BAM so many different options pop up. And they range from easy simple recipes to master level. LOVE THIS!
12693,12693,5,2014-11-23T10:01:41.000Z,Legzmcgee,Wonderful,Yummly is a wonderful app! If I just have an idea of what I want all I have to do is search and find the best recipe option! Varietals of recipes I had not thought of and ratings of each. And I love that they email me ideas too!
12694,12694,4,2015-01-17T20:38:48.000Z,Mjktnw86,Great yummy app,There is a lot of combinations that work really well together when I go through the recipes.

It's so annoying."
12697,12697,5,2015-09-07T15:17:43.000Z,td88keyz,So many ideas!,"When looking for ideas for dinner, I can never go wrong with the recipes found on Yummly."

I don't feel bad around dinner time because the meal was so excellent. It really simplifies the thinking process at a time when I'm hungry and not thinking straight.
12700,12700,5,2015-08-02T05:45:29.000Z,jasminrb45,Aesthetically pleasing,"I've always looked for a good app to supply recipes and this is the one. Not only does it have delectable recipes, but it also presents them in a sleek, organized  way. Even includes a shopping list. I recommend it!"
12701,12701,4,2016-01-13T20:35:29.000Z,Baha Mama,Unsure__?,"2015 I had this app and used it for one recipe. I enjoy the ease of making a grocery list for items needed for recipes and all the varieties of meal prep, but it has become slow and lacks the variety it used to have. Please check and fix for all to enjoy."
12702,12702,5,2016-03-04T23:56:56.000Z,Mtn's,Yummly- a source of tasty recipes,I have been using this app for over a year. It hasn't disappointed me. I can easily organize recipes by categories. I also like that receiving a weekly email of trending recipes.
12703,12703,4,2016-03-09T01:40:47.000Z,Jenni-O27,Great App Most of the Time,"The app has a great deal of recipes. Not all come out the right way but the majority does. My biggest problem would be that the explore section has not worked for me for a couple of months.. Otherwise, I use the app often."

Has been a game changer for me - I don't like to meal plan but I always have a list of great recipes to try now.

12709,12709,1,2017-07-19T01:35:51.000Z,Hughessk,Crashes,"I'm running the latest iPhone software and just updated this app. It immediately crashes after I open it. I have deleted and redownloaded, and restarted my phone to try again. I liked the previous versions of this app. I only updated because I was in the middle of cooking dinner and a message popped up saying there was a new version and it would not let me go back to my recipe without updating. Not cool!!üò°üò°üò°"

I was looking for a good recipe app for a while until I found this one. It has everything you're looking for!
12713,12713,5,2013-12-21T05:14:54.000Z,Athmedhero,Outstanding!,Captivating from the moment you open the app. Yummly has a GREAT user interface and it's not complex at all. I love it and they really have an amazing amount of recipes to find and explore! Definitely giving it my recommendation :)
12714,12714,4,2014-05-16T13:16:58.000Z,Shi_rox,The only thing missing,This app was a game changer for my eating habits and I've never been more great ful! They just need like a section for non food items so I can make my grocery list fast and easy and use it for everything. Other than that it's purrrrfection

I have found Yummly to be a lifesaver. I have found so many great tasting recipes that others have enjoyed as well. This app is incredible."

12719,12719,5,2017-07-11T01:26:52.000Z,RunnerNV,Perfect!!,Great app. I've been using it for one week now and have made at least 10 different recipes. Very easy to find what you want and everything has been delicious so far.
12720,12720,5,2015-08-28T16:39:57.000Z,FreiburgEm,Completely changed the way I eat,I've always struggled to cook. This app has changed that. The recipes are great. You can find anything at any skill level. I eat delicious and healthy things every day now.

12722,12722,4,2016-05-24T16:56:46.000Z,pickles12341,Hat's off to you,Yummly is great but here's the schtick...There's no rating system of the recipes. Having this feature would make the system more user oriented and help people know which cookies really are better than the last 12 dozen chocolate chip recipes one can try.
12723,12723,5,2016-06-04T04:10:49.000Z,Kateinthemoment,Yay so good,I am in love with this app. Cooking at home has always been challenging for me because finding a recipe that fits my family is really hard to fine( we are all picky eaters) but this app makes it fun and easy. So if you like cooking get it!!!!
12724,12724,5,2016-09-21T14:15:06.000Z,Tree8733,Godly,My husband was showing his mom this app because she has extensive food allergies and it looked cool so I got it too. Wow. Tons of resources for any kind of food you want all within your personal parameters. I can get loads looking at this app.
12725,12725,5,2016-10-18T22:49:21.000Z,HAYLERz101,Awesome!,Honestly yummly is the best recipe app I've found. Super user-friendly and convenient. All the recipes I've tried so far have been great as well! I never recommend apps to anyone but I have recommended yummly to sooooo many people!
12726,12726,5,2017-01-01T17:40:49.000Z,Annie Marble Rye,I love this app.,"I use this app all the time.  I'll use the search tool and enter the one item I want to base my meal around ex. Fennel, and be inspired by hundreds of recipes with this ingredient.  I also like how the ingredient lists are the tap of a button."
12727,12727,5,2017-01-02T03:05:35.000Z,Schmuhl,Use it several times a week!,Best way to find and compare recipes when you're looking for something specific or just want to browse.
12728,12728,2,2017-01-21T16:44:54.000Z,JB28671,Good variety and suggestions but enough with the ads,"I really like this app ( would rate higher) with the suggestions, options shown when searching and the consolidation from all sources of recipes. However I really wish there was an (paid) option to get rid of all the ads. I really just want the recipe and the ads are more than a nuisance."
12729,12729,5,2017-04-21T18:08:41.000Z,Nada Lis,Organizational Heaven,I love the way you can find any recipe in any category and then save your favorites in your organized folders. Allows this disorganized person to appear like I've got it all under control!
12730,12730,5,2014-04-07T00:42:55.000Z,graphicaljazz,Awesome so far,"With lots of food intolerances, it is great to have an app that searches on a key ingredient, filters out what I can't have, and keeps track of my faves. I'm really enjoying the simplicity of using this, and the great recipes as well."
12731,12731,5,2014-06-19T18:22:39.000Z,Lynn_tp,mummlyyummuly,"Unfortunately my teen daughter found this app and now she bugs me to make ""this and that...oooh that looks yummy...!"" and ""c'mon try and make this"" We both love to cook so this app is a great ""addition"" to our ""addiction"".  Great graphics too...so pleasant to look at...!"
12732,12732,5,2014-08-31T19:22:44.000Z,Brownbruster,Love it,"I love this app.  It would be nice if instead of bringing up the actual website for the recipe that the directions come up in the app itself.  More of a convenience issue.  But, for the most part, i like it."
12733,12733,5,2014-10-25T16:24:49.000Z,PegahP,LOVE.,"Yummly is one reliable app I use on a regular basis that eliminates the need to keep looking at different food blogs to find recipes I am interested in. Just type in ingredients you have on hand and rejoice! It is well-designed and neat, simple, and free! I'm keeping it."
12734,12734,5,2014-12-20T22:54:27.000Z,shelsey_mama,The Best!!!,"I love this app. I was looking for a shopping list app and stumbled on this. The shopping list is only part of what this app has to offer. I love the all-in-one aspect of the app (shopping list, recipes, etc). It's definitely a must-have!"
12735,12735,5,2015-01-05T04:27:55.000Z,jennmarie34,So helpful and easy,I love that you can select your food preferences. I eat Paleo and inflammatory free for health reasons and I love having a free app that helps me plan meals for my family- I can find recipes right as I'm grocery shopping and it's so easy to use!

This user-friendly layout combined with the awesome recipes you can find there makes this my favorite kitchen app. I love how it easily organizes a shopping list for you; making the preparation to cook, much faster."

12742,12742,5,2013-11-30T21:59:50.000Z,Sheba's Mom 2,Fabulous App for My Food Allergies,"I love how I can tailor my recipe searches to match my food allergies. I also love being able to filter out certain words so that I can search for 'oysters', yet omit recipes containing either 'oyster mushrooms' or 'oyster sauce'. Very easy to flexible."
12743,12743,5,2016-02-28T23:56:20.000Z,Divided if,Easy recipes with common ingredients!,I use this ap all the time. It covers everything from slow cookers to grilling. And I love that I generally don't have to chase down fancy ingredients. Great fir everyday meals and some fresh easy ideas.
12744,12744,5,2016-03-29T15:24:28.000Z,Willrodz,It's Awesome,As a dad and husband. I find myself relying on yummly a lot when I want to cook something good and different for my family. I also love baking pastries and sweets. And yummly has proved more than helpful when I take on those tasks too.

12748,12748,4,2017-02-05T19:55:22.000Z,Hippiehijabi,Nice app,Well made and easy to use. Only gave it four stars because the suggestions it offers me are usually repeats so that gets redundant. But the search option is great! And it makes a grocery list for you if you want that too.
12749,12749,4,2017-06-04T11:56:51.000Z,Lady ma'am,Small fry,"I'm always using the app, however I dislike that every 2 seconds it refreshes my personalized settings. So then I can't look at the recipes following what I just looked at because they've been cycled out. That's my only gripe, other than that it's awesome lol!"
12750,12750,5,2015-04-24T15:47:24.000Z,Sflashviola,I love this app!!,"I think Yummly is brilliant!  I love that I can select types of cuisine, diets, allergies, and foods that my family dislikes so I only see recipes that I want to cook. I also like being able to see the nutritional value of the meal."

12754,12754,5,2015-08-10T15:53:59.000Z,Monay270,Absolutely Love It!!!,I love this app!  It has a very large variety of recipes from simple 10 to 20 minute prep and cooking times to more complex and creative recipes that takes a bit more time to prepare.  Highly recommended.
12755,12755,4,2015-09-28T03:22:09.000Z,Scottaroony,Surprisingly good!,"I originally saw a recipient that I wanted to make, and it would not let me view the recipe unless I downloaded the app. So I did. I was annoyed at the marketing techniques, but I'm happy with the app, after a few questions it now shows me all the recipes I'm interested in."
12756,12756,5,2015-12-13T06:01:58.000Z,Tip-toekisses,great for picky eaters!,I myself being an extremely picky eater and also a vegetarian found it difficult to find recipes online. With yummy you select what foods you don't want and it finds recipes to fit your needs! Awesome.
12757,12757,4,2015-12-23T23:55:28.000Z,Sister and when,Very useful,"I use this every week. Has a great pool of recipes! Only problem is when you create a new category, some of your saved recipes will not show in the list even though it says you have ""x amount"" of recipes in there."
12758,12758,5,2016-02-11T15:44:32.000Z,Hrl12,Love it!!,"I love yummly! Not a day goes by I don't use it! The shopping list is awesome! So Convenient! I've recommended it all my friends. So easy, so fast, always satisfied! Filers are great and always find what I need! Yummly makes breakfast lunch and dinner the best time of the day!"
12759,12759,5,2016-02-20T01:01:28.000Z,CatBlazer,Finally,"I think this app is one of the best ones for recipes out there! Not only do you get pictures but you can sort your recipes based on your food preferences, eating likes and dislikes and dietary restrictions! Great idea Yummly"

12761,12761,4,2014-05-31T00:48:39.000Z,star2fire,First week with it,"I'm getting used to the app, and so far I find it highly useful both before and during grocery shopping. The recipes have all been great as well. Other reviewers suggested good updates already... I recommend this app."
12762,12762,4,2014-06-28T15:25:27.000Z,lefthandedsnail,"Great concept, almost lives up to its potential","Truly a brilliant idea: a recipe filter that you can reset to fit your needs. The way different sites format their recipes can throw off some filters, though. Once that hurdle gets jumped, five stars all the way."
12763,12763,2,2014-09-09T02:53:52.000Z,sepibo,Great Recipes but ...,My only issue with the app is that if you choose a recipe & start cooking following its directions the app won't stay in the recipe of your choice. It times out & goes back to the main menu. This means you have to search for that recipe all over again. So your attention is divided as you have to keep touching the screen so it doesn't time out.
12764,12764,5,2014-11-06T18:03:38.000Z,ersalazar1,Nice app,In this excellent app you can see the recipes and every thing you need to cook. You even have the list of thing that you have to buy and for what number of people you want a do it

Almost all of them display nicely, but some sites display just as they would on a laptop or computer."
12766,12766,5,2014-12-27T02:05:04.000Z,vbgrl93013,GREAT APP,Such a great app. I am always looking for new recipes and love that the recipes in this app come with the nutrition information! My only suggestion is that the nutrition info can be linked to other fitness apps such as lose it or my fitness pal

Gluten, dairy and eggs are limited. I LOVE yumly! It has made the transition so easy for me and I haven't had to go out and buy an entire new library of cook books. Thank you!!"

I like that it creates your shopping list for your selected recipes, but it is so hard to find your selected recipes when you are ready to use them. I wish it'd move anything selected to a new list or to the top."

12783,12783,5,2016-04-23T15:38:49.000Z,R7-üëÅ,Amazing App. Personalized to taste !!!,Great experience and very easy to use. It guides you through simple steps so it can get to know your taste better later uses that information to create recipes that your into.

The ""Just for you"" option will filter out only the gluten free recipes for you and the recipes are from all different sources so you get a great variety."
12785,12785,4,2016-06-19T19:19:21.000Z,NaidA99,Great app but has some issues,Love the app. Only a few things I think can be improved. 1. Pages load slow or not at all. 2. Sometimes shows me same recipes over and over when browsing thru. Otherwise great app!!
12786,12786,5,2016-07-14T21:55:28.000Z,A bylaw,Love this app!!,"I just love this app! I grew tired of the repetitive menu-week after week, esp. after eliminating meat from my diet. I downloaded the app, and I have been trying new recipes and I can't complain about the leftover. Just yummy!"

12788,12788,2,2016-10-24T23:30:34.000Z,LAS1988,Dietary preferences are pointless,"I downloaded this app to get some new vegan recipes. I went through all the dietary questions, stated I was vegan, no dairy, no meat, etc., and after filling out all the info, one of the first 'personalized' recipes that popped up for me was cheesy cheddar biscuits. One of the main ingredients is Parmesan cheese. This might be a good app if you have no dietary restrictions but if you do, this won't work for you."

12790,12790,1,2014-11-27T00:22:47.000Z,Kaymassho,Poor design,I needed this app while I was at the store today since it was is the day before thanksgiving. I decided to trust it to store the recipes I wanted for thanksgiving. To my surprise the server was down. Causing me to have to do searches for these recipes and was a huge waste of time. I even forgot a recipe I needed and had to run back out. Will not be trusting this website anymore and will be storing backup files which shouldn't be necessary.
12791,12791,5,2014-11-29T15:58:45.000Z,Meganlomaniac,Great app for foodies,"Love the recipes on this app. It's now my go-to app for trying new recipes. It takes a little bit of a learning curve but once you figure out how to add recipes by clicking on the ""yum"" it gets easier."
12792,12792,3,2014-12-22T14:10:18.000Z,Yxchou,Great app but missing a few features,It works well to search various recipes and it is also easy to create a shopping list.   I wish directions of recipes of my collections can be viewed offline. Also it will be nice if I can add my own notes to the recipes that I collected and my own recipes.
12793,12793,5,2015-01-29T09:56:40.000Z,Stugitz,Learned to cook,I'm a 40 year old man who burnt scrambled eggs and undercooked burgers - now with this app it has given me ideas for meals and deserts and showed me how to make them.

My only complaint would be, on my phone and tablet, it forces you to open the app instead of continuing to browse or read detail on a recipe. When you forget your password, that's a pain!"

You can filter out type of stuff like ingredients that you don't like or are allergic to (quite useful). One thing I want is to be able to browse by category.
12803,12803,3,2014-04-12T13:35:22.000Z,Cookinginpawleys,Not iPad friendly,"I want to start off by saying that the function of the app is great. However, it only appears in portrait mode. If I am using a device for recipes in the kitchen, the iPad in landscape mode on a stand is the logical choice, not an iPhone in my flour covered hands. If an iPad app with landscape mode is made, then I would give Yummly 5 stars."

12809,12809,1,2017-04-11T20:28:12.000Z,Domoval,Disappointing,"I was so excited about the app. Love the questions and set up and the entire idea to personalize recipes based on one's preferences... the problem is i am an advanced cook and when I entered that my preferred recipes would be Indian, Moroccan and Asian, all I received in my feed was chicken dishes that are american recipes. This app represents that it covers all sorts of cultural recipes but they don't have much except mostly pasta dishes and chicken dishes."

12818,12818,5,2016-03-19T20:04:21.000Z,Ktellias,Yummly is super!,It's a great resource for finding all kinds of recipes. The rating system gives you an idea of how tasty they will turn out and how easy or hard they will be. I use it often!

This app has been amazing for me to branch out and cook really delicious meals I probably wouldn't be cooking without the ease of Yummly.

Now for the past 6 months including today I cannot log in on my phone via fb and it's very annoying.  All the recipes, my profile, my preferences...all gone.  I'm assuming it's not just me and its been long enough for this to have been fixed/updated."

When I opened it up it wanted personal info. I skipped that because I just wanted to view the recipe!!! The recipe popped up but when I tried to open it, it disappeared and about a hundred other recipes appeared! Could you make it any harder just to look at a recipe? I will be deleting the app."
12840,12840,3,2014-01-23T23:50:11.000Z,mikey_n,Mandatory account?,"After exploring the app for a bit, the most obnoxious part is the sign in pop-up. I don't think it's fare that you HAVE to link or create an account in order to save recipes. I don't want to feel obligated to sign into an app, and unfortunately with Yummly, that is the case. 3/5 stars is the best I can give it."

The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is because once I tag a recipe, such as sole, it gives me more suggestions that are too similar. The shopping list option is great!"

The only part I don't like is the push toward specific when others might be cheaper and better-- the feeling of being manipulated.
12900,12900,5,2013-12-08T15:48:37.000Z,Megz*,Best cooking app of them all!!,It really is!! There are so many great recipes. I love that you can search them by whatever you're looking for (eg. breakfast no egg). Why are you still reading this? Download it & get to cooking!

For example, I would type in ""Tofu"" and get one recipe on how to make a smoothie, one small ingredient being tofu. Is there nothing out there that isn't under 300 calories, 12 carbohydrates, and 10 grams of fat?"
12922,12922,5,2015-07-12T17:19:02.000Z,docopera,Best recipe site,The variety of recipes is excellent! The app functions flawlessly. The only perk missing is a way to make personal notes on a recipe after having tried it.

13089,13089,4,2015-12-10T02:14:32.000Z,haleeyamaya,Amazing App.,It's amazing has so many recipes but in my opinion I think for people who don't know much about ingredients that they should include a picture next to them so people know what they are. But other than that amazing I love it.

13093,13093,5,2014-10-02T23:01:26.000Z,Privasea,Would be five stars,Visually appealing. Easy to use. Only issue is that some recipes are linked to other sites and difficult to read.

13096,13096,3,2015-02-15T22:58:43.000Z,mekuhl,Pretty....,much a pain to use. All these inviting pictures seem to only lead to content from other sites that render awkwardly in the app. If they did as good a job extracting the instructions as they do extracting the ingredients and nutrition this could be very useful. For now it is rife with frustration and disappointment.
13097,13097,2,2015-06-16T22:39:58.000Z,Hiccupz,Could be better,"My main gripe is how you yum a recipe and then 100 recipes for the thing you just yummed come up. Give me similar things, not the exact same things! I also want a better way to sort recipe categories. Right now theres no quick way to just look at Mexican for example. Improve these and 5 stars"

It requires you to sign in every single time, even if you know exactly what recipe you want. It's annoying."

It is a main concern for me because I am allergic to both wheat and peanuts, and when I am online I mainly only get drink recipes, some more variety would be nice with the recipes."

You can browse recipes and essentially bookmark and organize the ones you like. The app is very well designed, pleasing to the eye if you will, and user friendly, but the variety and availability of content is currently lacking."

However, there is just a tiny little bug, which prevents me from seeing more than 4-5 recipes in my feed sometimes.

They spent time on the ingredients list that links to Instacart, probably because they get paid for the referral, or maybe Instacart owns them, but the recipe section is just the web page crammed into the tiny phone screen with huge obnoxious ads obscuring the instructions. #winning."

13721,13721,3,2013-10-02T23:33:01.000Z,Ejo95,Disappointing,I downloaded this today and I'm disappointed. The app keeps freezing up and the screen goes black. It also keeps kicking me out and I have to start all over. Not very reliable.
13722,13722,1,2016-12-18T01:33:07.000Z,Bosoxwill,Minimalism at its worst,This app is so crowded with ads and paid-for links that it's unusable.  I'm sure the recipes are fine if you can get a machete to cut your way to a place where you can read them. The ads are so bad they overlap each other.  Do not get this app unless they improve this. I don't object to ads but this app is unusable.
13723,13723,5,2017-01-08T00:11:00.000Z,JP Dancer,My go to recipe app,Works fantastic. Recipes galore and love the added ability to add recipes that I find online. Highly recommend!

Sometimes can get link but most times is ""oops..."" and can't.  Tech support did not solve.  So now just look at ingredients and guess what to do - not much use.  Using iPhone with latest iOS"

Stop trying to force me to make your app viral- it should go viral on its own. You're doing it wrong!!

Otherwise this is a great app especially if you‚Äôre beginner.I have cook things I thought I would never learned from someone else and found it in this app"

No recipe pictures anymore and all searches take you to food.com which is equally dismal in its display. And ive updated a few times since then. And search filter also soooo limited.

You can search by more then one keyword and see ingredients right away.   There are many filters to help you find just the right recipe.  Then you will link to original blog or website for the recipe directions.   You can set up custom folders for storing favorites or potential recipe  There can be inaccurate measures occasionally when you compare actual recipe   to Yummly list , but overall it‚Äôs a great tool.

But it‚Äôs nice to use an app like Yummly where there are thousands of recipes for everything u can think of. Just wanted to make sure I point out it takes all the measurements into account. Wether ur feeding 6 people or 20. I have recommended this app to both family and friends.

They give you the recipe for the dish and also reviews which gives you an idea if your family or my husband will like it too. I tried a recipe from yum on my nephew and his family and it was a hit.

The recipes can adjust the serving size..screen shot the recipe because the adjustments don‚Äôt carry over to the recipe‚Äôs site. Only flaw.Try it is free, you can upgrade for an up charge ..haven‚Äôt tried it yet."

I can save tons of awesome recipes in multiple categorized areas so I can find them super easy. And there‚Äôs tons of recipe options to choose from!! I also like that it shows you a shopping list - you can send it to yourself and sit prices it out among some popular grocery stores. It‚Äôs so handy and functional. I don‚Äôt cook very often so as a beginner who needs inspiration and easy things to make, this is the perfect place to find what I need!!"
17545,17545,5,2020-04-29T22:56:52.000Z,Col-lean,And the winner is...,I decided to use the quarantine as a time to decide which recipe app I would give my loyalty to.

I took the update today (3/9/20) and it‚Äôs frozen 4 times and moved ridiculously slow, twice, AND THEN freezes!  I exited out and signed back in and it moved like molasses in the winter AND THEN froze. I deleted the app (lost all my previously saved recipes), created a whole new account and started searching recipes (you know where this is going, don‚Äôt you!) AND THEN it froze!  So, I‚Äôll be deleting the app and going back to my previous ways of getting recipes and that‚Äôs by searching on the web. It‚Äôs better than whatever they did to the app."

There needs to be a code in which the app recognizes that there is already an item in the list and will not double up such. An alternative is maybe adding a way to say ‚ÄúHey, I have this, I don‚Äôt need it!‚Äù Much like the salt and pepper. That would dramatically increase the functionality and make this app much smoother and easier to use. Otherwise, amazing!"

I‚Äôve never been able to import one from Crome. That‚Äôs always been a pain. This is so frustrating! I find great recipes on the web and want to save ones we like in my virtual cookbook, but now I cannot. Why? I‚Äôve spent far too much time trying to figure this out.

17614,17614,5,2019-02-18T00:01:25.000Z,crasy panes,Love the recipes,"My daughter and I love this site. We find a recipe, make it, take a picture and send it to each other. All are pretty easy and most only require ingredients that you already have. Pot roast with garlic made the best gravy ever."

17617,17617,4,2019-03-02T19:34:32.000Z,LA Fly line,Photos are best part,Yummly does a pretty good job of aggregating recipes from a bunch of different sources. The best part of the app is all the food porn that makes you want to try new things.
17618,17618,5,2019-03-16T23:38:51.000Z,Pokerslt1,VERY USEFUL APP!,Love this app!!No need for a cookbook haha.thousands of great recipes with several cooking options is always a good thing.
17619,17619,1,2019-03-23T12:10:10.000Z,Jojo_19_70,Used to love it,But now it demands I create a username & password for recipes. Enough data collection; deleting.

17622,17622,5,2018-10-07T00:03:43.000Z,cornue1,Great App!,I love this app-I can find all of my favorite recipes and ‚ÄúYUM‚Äù ones I‚Äôd never heard of. This Instacart link lets me send it right to them so I can shop and get my groceries delivered. As a new mom it‚Äôs key!
17623,17623,5,2018-10-18T05:05:32.000Z,bradandmegs,Amazing!,Amazing!
17624,17624,4,2018-10-29T16:17:59.000Z,chelledlion,It‚Äôs okay,"Only because sometimes I end up using Allrecipes.com instead of this app, cause I find that it has recipes that people like more."
17625,17625,5,2018-11-03T00:05:11.000Z,Chacon52,-,AW h  I just got u by    U u u u u up  invu  u u to a w
17626,17626,2,2018-11-19T23:42:39.000Z,Princess Cyndie,Too many ads!,I couldn‚Äôt even view the directions for a recipe because an ad popped up for YouTube and I couldn‚Äôt exit out of it! So ridiculous!  I love the app other than that but if you can‚Äôt get the directions then what‚Äôs the point??

17628,17628,5,2018-12-07T02:46:44.000Z,Emu taco's,Would recommend!!,"I LOVE this app. It‚Äôs always so hard to meal plan especially on a budget and this makes it SO much easier. I‚Äôve been really trying to eat healthier and watch what I eat more and this helps so much. You can find a recipe you like and add stuff to your ‚Äúgrocery list‚Äù. Easy peasy! (Never wrote that out before and it looks weird but I‚Äôm leaving it) so far it hasn‚Äôt asked me to pay for having a meal plan app which is another thing I love and am always concerned about. Being on a budget for my groceries, I don‚Äôt really want to pay to have an easier way to get food in my belly. They show YouTube videos, recipes, tips, and you can add your own too."
17629,17629,5,2019-01-12T17:40:29.000Z,2Littlemonsters,The best recipe app,"The best recipe app.Easy to use, lots of options,Helps to stay organized"

17632,17632,5,2018-01-18T20:29:44.000Z,dloies,Low-cal Banana Bread,"Loved this Banana Bread! Easy to make. My grand-daughter (banana bread expert) even loved it.Took more than 20min. to bake though, more like 30 - 35. Definitely will make it againüòä."
17633,17633,4,2018-02-28T21:02:04.000Z,ReedMikel,Great app!  Doesn‚Äôt display full size on iPad,"Love Yummly so far!  Only negative is that on my iPad it displays in a tiny, unsizable window that approximates the size of an iPhone. I‚Äôm guessing they are using the same code for both devices?"
17634,17634,5,2018-05-16T21:47:14.000Z,ttm:(******+*{,Awesome app,Really good app.really easy to use and amazing recipes!
17635,17635,1,2018-05-25T21:16:51.000Z,SherriSCT,Not working today 5/25/2018,Keeps telling me to edit my preferences; I don‚Äôt have any selected. Added some preferences and still get same message...normally good app- not sure what the issue is.

17637,17637,1,2018-07-19T19:24:24.000Z,deleat1111111121it,It has its limitations,I think a recipe book shouldn‚Äôt password from hell more passwords and username to remberi will now delete it every app needs me to remember different user name and password
17638,17638,5,2018-07-21T15:26:28.000Z,sandra wyatt,My favorite recipe app,"I love this app , tells you everything you needs to know very convenient.so easy to understand and very many recipes to choose from."
17639,17639,2,2018-07-23T21:09:11.000Z,surgetek33,App doesn‚Äôt open from links,"We use Yummly a lot for our recipes. But EVERY time my wife texts me a recipe, it refuses to open. It brings me to some portion of the app and then locks up. I end up having to open the actual Yummly app on my phone and hopefully find the same recipe.  Pain in the butt!!!"
