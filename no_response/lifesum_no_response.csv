0,0,5,2018-10-07T13:03:20.000Z,Crmnvds,So elegant and visually appealing,"What a gorgeous app- that alone makes me want to open it and track. I love that it there's a water tracker, daily fruit and vegetable and weekly seafood tracker and that they give you a life score with details on what to improve each week. Sure, a few glitches like not currently syncing with Health app (I open both then close both and open once more then it tracks), and the recipes and sometimes the database doesn't have the exact food but does have something comparable, just takes a smidgen more work. The beta camera isn't the greatest if you have a deep dish as opposed to a plate but it sure is handy and easy enough to adjust. And there's not many recipes, but the ones available are easy to follow and pleasant to eat, plus how often does one follow a recipe to a T? I've tried other tracking apps (looking at you MFP) and all the ads and monotone color scheme make them too unidimensional- this is beautiful, too beautiful not to use. And the step counter that equates steps to what you burn makes me just competitive enough with myself to make me want to walk even more (I burned 1.5 croissants?!? Bet I can burn 2!). I'd like to buy the app developers a beer. Then go walk said beer off. I saw a couple of review that say the app is rigid in terms of certain foods like sunflowers, and though I appreciate the sentiment, I am using the app for weight loss and do indeed want to know if a food is high in caloric content."
1,1,5,2018-02-10T14:31:26.000Z,BitsyJo,Beautiful! But could use customized notifications.,"This app is gorgeous! I love the articles and the recipes look absolutely scrumptious. The aesthetics alone are what make this the most effective app, and it is super smooth! Even on this old phone, where everything else crashes. Huge thanks to the devs for achieving this. Now, I turned on notifications expecting reminders to update my water or add my meals and exercise, which would be really nice! Sometimes you get busy and don't track anything; it is the LAST thing on your mind. I did, however, get constant reminders to update my weight. As someone who has a Lifesum of 119 (almost completely perfect! 😲), I find that a little unhealthy. No-one should be weighing themselves every day, especially if you already have an unhealthy relationship with your weight, body fat percentage, or food. Even on a practical level, it doesn't make much sense. So I turned off the notifications, but it would be nice to be able to select what kind of notifications we get in the future! Such as for new recipes or articles, and reminders in other areas of body and health maintenance. Or a way to change the frequency: Weighing yourself every X amount of days. If there is already a way to do this, I hope the settings for it become easier to find. ❤️ Thanks for reading!"
2,2,4,2021-02-06T23:22:22.000Z,Jackinzi,Beautiful and easy to use with some adaptability issues,"First of all, the visual design of this app is incredible. Other similar apps have designs that make it feel outdated, which in turn can make the data or plans feel outdated even when that’s not true. Gorgeous color scheme, icons, motion design, etc, and lots of great features like the barcode scanner and ability to quickly select previous days’ meals."
3,3,3,2019-01-30T00:43:11.000Z,stuphunuu,Meal plans impractical,Just downloaded this today and got a premium subscription for 3 mos. Haven’t been able to do much but most of the features seem nice! I like that it tells you how good certain foods or meals are for you and tracks how “on track” you are. It puts it a step ahead of most other trackers I’ve seen.
4,4,5,2019-10-15T00:23:50.000Z,Liccie D,Delete My Fitness Pal!,"I don’t normally review apps but this is one EVERYONE should definitely try. This is the first app that I’ve actually lost weight with.. it actually helps you develop better eating habits. I know that there’s a lot of hype behind My Fitness Pal, but I swear, after trying both, LIFESUM BEATS MY FITNESS PAL HANDS DOWN. Nearly everything since the app has gone through updates is perfect. The user-face is simple and easy to use, without the annoying ads other apps have. You can adjust everything to fit your personal goals, even if they go beyond what the app recommends. They even include a macro calculator that makes things easy to calculate. The grading scale is really helpful to see where you can improve. It takes everything into account, calories, macros, sugar, fiber... it’s pretty comprehensive. Also, I love that I can keep everything private, it’s not necessarily a competition against all of my Facebook friends. The graphs and diagrams make seeing long term trends quick and easy. One thing I would love to see is something that suggests meals or specific items that would meet the goals of the meal. If I have 200 calories left and haven’t met my protein, fat, or carbs goals, what can I add to my meal that fits my goals? Other than that, the developers have done an absolutely stellar job."
5,5,4,2020-10-23T23:34:48.000Z,Kcarrasco09,Fun Macro Tracker,"I really love the design of this app and that you can follow plans that will adjust your macros for you. I also like like that you can capture a photo of your food for each meal, however, unfortunately, this functionality doesn’t work most of the time. Once I take a picture it doesn’t show in the app right a way, most of the time I have to take the pic a couple of times, close the app, reopen it and then the pic may or may not show up. So it would be nice if that could get fixed. Also, there isn’t an easy way to copy a meal from another day to a different meal. So if I ate something for breakfast yesterday, there’s no  easy way to copy that to lunch the next day. And when searching for foods, your recents don’t come up. For example, if I wanted to add a food and it’s not showing in my most recent but I’ve logged it before, it would be nice to have it so up in my search when I go to search the food in the search bar. Another thing this app is missing is the ability to see what foods were highest in each macro. So if I wanted to see what foods I ate that day where highest in fat or protein.. Other macro apps have this, which was nice because then you could see what foods may be bumping up a macro too much or vice versa. Overall I have enjoyed this app and really like the design. However there are a few functionalities that are missing."
6,6,5,2020-05-16T12:18:16.000Z,Hwbfowuhrofi,"Awesome, but there are some errors.","I’ve been using this app for as long as I can remember and I recently just upgraded to the Premium, which I love! I love the aesthetic of the app and the visuals and colors it uses. I love the wide variety of recipes, even thought I don’t use them that much. I love the weekly rating I get so that I can look at my past week and see what I need to improve on for the next one. However, there are a couple things I find I have trouble with. The main thing is that when I go to update my weight, I check on it the next day and it says “Nothing lost, nothing gained.” So whenever I update my weight and maybe i’ve lost a pound or two, i’ll update my weight. But the next day when I go to look at my weight it erased it or changed it back to the starting weight. It does this almost all the time and is pretty annoying because I have to delete the starting weight that it put it back on for that day, at the same time deleting the weight that I put in. Another thing that’s minor is that when I go to take a picture of my food, sometimes it doesn’t work and the picture never shows up. I do really love this app but I don’t know if anyone else has the weight changing itself issue or not."
7,7,5,2020-10-03T16:56:37.000Z,juneauTracy,Love the app as is but would also love upgrades,"I started using Lifesum to track my intake.  It is easy to use and very visual.  However, there are a couple of upgrades I would like seeing.  First, I would like to see Fat broken down into Total, Sat, Monounsaturated, and Polyunsaturated.  I would also like to see Carbs broken down into Total, Fiber, Sugar Alcohols, Added Sugar, and Net Carbs.  (Currently, the app simply subtracts fiber from total carbs to calculate net carbs.). Also, since I work with a functional medicine professional who is interested in seeing my intake, I would like to see the ability to export data.  As I used to program (albeit mainframe),  I know how long upgrades take to implement; it is possible some of these are already in the works.  They were meant only as suggestions.  Long story short, I am very happy with the app as it is even if it misses some of my personal desires.  Thank you for the work you put in to bring such a useful app to market.  Oh, last but not least, I think it would be better to let users know that full, continued use of the app requires a subscription.  The cost is nominal for the usefulness, but it was frustrating when I first found out about the cost after downloading the app."
8,8,3,2020-08-19T15:27:57.000Z,foodeats,"It’ll get the job done, but it could be better","Calorie tracking and dieting options work well and seem to cover a wide variety of needs. It is cumbersome to find the food and/or measurement needed for accurate tracking at times; requiring the user to do some creative math or mental gymnastics to figure out what should be entered. I paid for a membership and feel it’s okay—I won’t likely be renewing. The recipes offer some tasty and decently filling alternatives, but are HORRIBLY written, as often as not. If you’re not familiar with finagling and “figuring out” a recipe or if that type of this is frustrating, this is not the app for you. This feels most functional for a few scenarios: first, the casual user who already has a decently healthy understanding of food, quantities, cooking, etc., and is just looking for a little guidance, new ideas for recipes or to literally track calories. Second, any of the diets, I’d bet, would work if you’re a person who can follow the recipe EXACTLY (I follow “classic” and “vegan” but would struggle with both if I didn’t already have experience eating/cooking alternative foods).  This WOULD NOT be for the user who doesn’t really know at least some about healthy eating (novice) nor would it be for the serious weight loss/health person (expert) as it just doesn’t support specifics well enough."
9,9,1,2019-11-23T23:17:36.000Z,BaeNextDoor,Support unavailable,Loved the interface of this app and found it easy to navigate my way around pretty easily when I did use it. The one star rating is due to my recent experience today. I have tried several times now to contact support through the Contact Us (in app chat) link and it continues to crash. The app is updated to the most recent version and so is the software on my phone. Have tried to resend the message several times and the app keeps crashing. I want to cancel my subscription and plan on deleting the app TODAY. I purchased the Premium version of the app about a year ago at a discounted rate during a promo offer they had at the time. They seem to have it set it up where you subscribe to their Premium services outside of iTunes so the subscription is actually processed through their own website. Renewal dates or expiration dates of said Premium services are nowhere to be found anywhere in the app. They then attempt to auto renew it later on at almost $50 USD with no communication beforehand via email or otherwise that they will be processing this amount. I did not even locate the option to downgrade my account or cancel anywhere within the Settings option within the Lifesum app. Luckily my bank caught the attempted transactions as fraud and did not allow them through. I’ll stick to apps that allow me to manage my subscriptions within iTunes to avoid headaches like this.
10,10,1,2018-04-16T05:53:39.000Z,TheDMTD,Won’t let you choose water bottle size,Update 2: Finally responded to my actual review. But they still are not going to implement the simple feature. I’m extremely disappointed that they are not prioritizing customer concerns.
11,11,5,2018-05-01T23:30:47.000Z,Deekajane,Great app that’s sure to get even better,"Ive been using Lifesum for a couple months now. Honestly I don’t use it everyday (I don’t track on weekends) but I love it! I love the look of it and the fun and encouraging tone. Love being able to see my macros front and center and seeing how my meal is looking on carbs, fat and protein. Two edits: as a previous review stated, notifications could use some work. Don’t need to weigh myself every single day, and also don’t need notifications for things I’ve already done (like log breakfast, etc.). Also get a note at 6 asking how my dinner was and I don’t eat til about 7:30 bc of my commute (this notification reminds me how much I hate it!! lol)."
12,12,2,2019-01-27T18:02:53.000Z,drahonslaya,New user- Edited,"I just started using this app, trying to really kick off my dieting. I like organization when I diet and i just wish you could more closely edit your planner from day to day. How it is set up now- you have to scroll through all of the days and once you finish one day you have to scroll alllllll the way back down to the next day. Also, not sure if it’s just a diet they are trying to promote, but no matter what answers I choose when taking the quiz I always get the Keto Burn. I don’t necessarily have a problem with this diet, I just would like to see what other diets I could choose from that would also be recommended. If I am just overlooking how to do this please let me know! Other than these two things I am very impressed with the app and how affordable it is!"
13,13,3,2020-04-15T01:59:36.000Z,MarinnaSmith,Good - Needs To Be More Regulated,"The interface of this app is great, there is little I would change about its functionality. I’ve been using it since late December and recently switched to premium a couple weeks ago. While I don’t regret going premium because of all the additional features, this app is far from perfect. My main complaint is that the entries could stand to be more consistently regulated across the board. Often times I’ll see multiple entries for the same product, all different from one another, yet still all somehow verified by Lifesum with the blue tick. Sometimes the difference in nutrition info between these listings has to do with how the person entered in the serving size, but other times all the nutritional information is out of whack on two or more listings of what is allegedly the same product. This kind of negates the convenience of being able to just quickly search up a food and add it to your diary. I end up adding most of my food manually in order to be sure my entry is accurate. Even when I scan barcodes, I double check the entered nutritional info with the info on the label. All in all, unless this changes and the info on the app becomes more reliable, I’ll probably try another similar app when my membership is up, maybe MyFitnessPal."
14,14,4,2021-04-29T01:17:13.000Z,Joe DiPasquale,Beautiful App and Great Plans with room to grow,This app is absolutely beautiful.  If a smooth flow and  easy navigation is important to you this might be a great place to start in your search for the perfect dieting app.  In addition to the look and feel it also has some great content.  My wife and I both tried the Paleo Diet for the first time in our lives. We loved the diet and everything it had to offer.  We also both experienced incredible results in both energy and weight loss.
15,15,2,2020-09-13T05:07:55.000Z,CSnotLewis,"Awful navigation, terrible tracker","This hets 2 stars instead of 1 because i do actually use it to track, mostly because there’s little better out there. But the rest of the app is total garbage. It is inaccurate and poorly sourced, confusing to navigate if you want to change your plan, and the nutritional meals are extremely confusing. First, it only allows you to choose one dietary choice. For example, i try and eat a low carb diet but i ALSO want to keep that diet by eating clean and whole foods. But i have to choose one or the other. I am a pescatarian, and for some reason I still get recipes that suggest chicken or other meat. Also the “nutritional tracker” is literally never happy—you could have the healthiest meal and it will say you are nutritionally off track because you didn’t hit *exactly* the nutritional intake it demands to the exact gram. If you have baked salmon, an extremely healthy food with lean protein and omega 3’s it says the meal is “too high in fat,” the same as if you had pizza. It doesn’t differentiate between good fats and bad. There’s no pleasing the nutritional tracker. It is annoying to search for recipes, and it seems like just a way for celebrity fitness influencers to make even more money when this could be an actual social app for real users to share recipes, exercises, and fitness data. What a waste."
16,16,3,2020-04-24T15:16:27.000Z,Mijuto82,Keep Improving This App,"I use a few apps for recipes already. Those apps all include nutrition values and labels. It would be nice if I could import/share those into lifesum without having to manually enter everything one at a time. A few of them have options to add those values to Apple health directly from the app. Lifesum writes data to health, but does not read. I think it would almost be better to separate functions out to apps. Have food apps handle entering / removing data into health and then have trackers reading and analyzing what you just ate so you can make informed decisions. I’d rather have two clean apps rather than one bloated app. I would imagine narrowing the scope would take out a lot of the overhead needed to maintain and update the app, thus making it even more clean and user friendly. Anyways, this is just my observation after using lots of food tracking apps. The interface may be different but functionally they are all kinda doing the same thing. I would also like to see more support for the Apple Watch when it comes to simple things like adding water and quick calories. The front end of this app is really beautifully done. If the back end was doing something unique then I could see myself paying for this app."
17,17,2,2020-11-05T17:13:06.000Z,Mags1313,False Advertising & Poor Diet Poor Diet Entry Choices,"Images displayed on Apple Apps fail to reflect the reality of the images and options offered in the app after purchasing premium version in all sections. For example I purchased the premium version yet was NEVER offered choices between diet plans as the first image on advertised app provided. I was never offered Keri, sugar free or other types of diet options as advertised. I was only offered choices of goals for weight"
18,18,2,2019-08-21T01:39:29.000Z,Annoyed bride,Easy to use but not enough info,Fun and easy to use with a lot of foods in their database. Sadly it really does not provide enough nutritional information and goes against a lot of info I’ve gotten from
19,19,2,2021-05-04T15:03:32.000Z,milkytrades666,App is just ok.,"This app is ok for tracking. However, when you go to enter the food choices several different versions of that food pop up all with caloric differences for the same food. I weigh my foods, & I see different caloric amounts for the weights of the same food. For example, Red grapefruit will have a few different choices to select from but no matter the ounces, the calories will slightly differ 30-50 cals. I don’t understand this & it can be very frustrating. & makes me feel as though my efforts are not always accurate & ultimately a wasteful purchase. The app has a nice design but could be better. Another feature that is annoying is if you want to review past food logs, & u leave the app open & go to do something else on your phone if you click back to the app it will reset to you viewing the food log of the current day. Which if you had to scroll back 8 days, you’d have to scroll back 8 days again even if you just go to do something else even though the app is open which again is annoying & there should be a better way to compare past to future logs. The app does have nice recipes thought too. Im not sure I’ll be renewing it, I might look for another food log app before my subscription is up."
20,20,2,2018-02-27T15:23:15.000Z,cjdell,Beautiful but needs work,"I got this app after seeing several ads for it in my Facebook feed. I like that it offers many different plans and gives you instant feedback on the quality of food you are eating, but many of the features advertised do not work properly. For example, I chose the three week weight loss plan. It generated recipes and a shopping list, which I thought was cool. But it does not let you add the recipes directly to your food diary -- clicking on the recipe did not do anything and I had to enter each ingredient manually, even though I followed the recipe exactly. This seems like a waste of time and a pretty big thing to overlook. Searching the recipe database for the recipe did not work either, as they are organized by tags and not by title or ingredient, making it even harder to find what you're looking for. I had to delete and reinstall the app to even get the water tracker to show up. There is also no way to manually sync the app with Fitbit; it just kind of does it when it wants to, which I also see as a major flaw. It's a beautiful app, but very clunky and full of dead ends. I paid for premium and at this point I wish I hadn't."
21,21,3,2018-04-20T17:15:42.000Z,NicknameCapone,Will Not Sync with Apple Health App,"I really like this app a lot. It’s very nice looking and motivating. I have been a paid subscriber for about 4 years now but am thinking that I might not be renewing this year. I’m not sure if the problem is with the Lifesum app or the Apple Health app, but the nutrition data will just not sync properly from Lifesum to the Health app. I am using the Health app to aggregate all of my health data which syncs properly from my sleep app, glucose app, exercise apps, etc., but not my diet/nutrition app which I consider to be essential for getting a complete health picture. I contacted the developer about this issue but was just told that they were working on it and informed as to how to get a refund and cancel my subscription. That was definitely not the answer I was looking for but may just take them up on it. What I really wanted to hear was a timeframe for getting this right. What I got from the response was that it wasn’t really a priority for them. I would like to know whether it is or not because if it is and they are expecting a breakthrough in the near future I would definitely stick with the app."
22,22,3,2018-05-19T04:38:54.000Z,Staerskye,"Pretty, but all the features require premium upgrade",So far I like the layout and the user friendly nature of this app. It’s easy to use and it has a nice aesthetic. The versatility of this app separates it from other fitness apps.
23,23,5,2018-10-28T18:19:11.000Z,Evilmititis,My perfect health app!,"So far I have been using this app for about two weeks, and it’s actually very impressive. I am coming from Samsung Health, which has helped me a lot over the past year and a half. However, after comparing the two, this app has so much more versatility and it’s very acute regardless of which diet you choose. I decided that I was going to go with the diet plan Clean Eating, and in doing so realized how off course my diet was. More specifically, my sugar addiction problem. I have been working on improving my cooking and reducing my sugar consumption so that I can live a much healthier life. With everything that is offered, I definitely believe that this app is worth paying for."

It’s awesome when you track your food and are able to see a rating beside what you’ve had. Also, it’s very easy to track your exercise. As of recently, I have purchased an Apple Watch and it makes it even easier because it just takes the activity information from my watch and coverts it into the app. There is also a cool weight tracker you can use to count towards your weight goals. Tracking water intake is also nice and the app even gives you tips and encouraging words to reach your water, calories per meal, and exercise goals. I thought every app like this was the same and they all seemed so hard to figure out. Lifesum is short, sweet, and simple and I give the creators and developers of this app major props because usually I get bored within this category of apps, but this one has kept me focused and excited to use it. Thank you, Lifesum!"
25,25,2,2019-03-26T16:49:08.000Z,jilshs,Not Great,"I bought the premium version because I thought it would be friendlier and more helpful than apps like myfitnesspal. Its not very smart, it doesn’t have a lot of foods in its database, and the recipes provided are few and not impressive. There’s no way to find easy meals, it seems to be time consuming and not super appetizing. For example, a suggested recipe to me was a tomato and buttermilk shake?? While that might not be hard to make, it sounds disgusting. Most of these recipes seem to be more about looks and “instagram” quality than nutrition and simplicity, which is what most people loom to food trackers for. In the app’s attempt to be more millenial-geared and well-rounded, they made a complicated app with a few flashy features (choosing your type of diet, taking a picture of your food to log it-which didn’t work when I tried-, and recipes-which have limited options and seem complicated). I wish they offered a trial of the premium but I understand why they don’t because I definitely wouldn’t have bought premium if I knew that not much would change, and the additional features are less than satisfactory. I absolutely regret purchasing this."
26,26,2,2020-06-22T23:03:16.000Z,MCinATX,Great for tracking calories. Overall discouraging.,"I read so many reviews to find an app to help me keep track of my food intake when I restarted the 5-2 Intermittent Fasting plan. This app does that, but overall is really discouraging and unrealistic. In 7 days of tracking, I have not had ONE meal that was not labeled “imbalanced” on this app. I’m either too high on protein or too high I’m carbs or too high on sugar (ANY meal that includes fruit) and frankly I am already sick of all their frown face icons and impossible standards. Today is my 500 calorie day — just finished dinner of a piece of broiled tilapia and a cup of broccoli with a tiny bit of garlic sauce.  Too high in protein and not enough carbs! For goodness sake, I’m limited to 500 calories! Almost all of my breakfasts have “not enough protein”, yet I looked through all their breakfast recipes and NONE of the low calorie recipes have the amount of protein they recommend.  Last week on my fast day it said I was too low in protein so I ate a hard boiled egg as my snack — and it said it was too much fat. There are no suggestions about alternatives that would be a better choice.  I fear this app has the propensity to lead to disordered eating and obsessing.  Very disappointed and I regret buying a six month membership that is not refundable."
27,27,5,2019-08-08T18:13:56.000Z,Cthftjjyfgjfjyf,Changed my life,This app is so great! I have lost 10 pounds with it so far and I’ve only been using it for a little over a month! I don’t have the premium plan so you can lose weight on it without having to pay for it which is amazing! I will continue to use this app until I reach my goal weight and I truly believe I can do that using This app. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to lose weight while still feeling in control with the classic weight loss plan.
28,28,2,2020-09-15T13:30:45.000Z,Nurse230,Many errors in the food database,"This has a beautiful Interface, super easy to use. However I really have many issues with their nutritional content, so if you’re needing this for something like diabetes where you’re doing insulin to carb ratio’s, or specific dietary needs gastroparesis, reduced fat things, I don’t think I would recommend it. There are many times where I will scan an item in and what presents on the screen is not what is on the label it’s really strange. There are other things were a number of carbs the serving size whatever or just incorrect. Not just of labeled items but regular things like banana whatever. Anyway it doesn’t work all that well when you don’t have exactly the serving size and even then a lot of the time it’s just not right. If you don’t need that level of detail it’s very easy to use and adds everything up for the day for the meal. They only offer one snack per day so if you have three small meals three small snacks, you just have to lump all your snacks into one snack. So if you’re looking at your finger across the day it’s a little in accurate. If it were only that I would recommend it, but there are too many other issues for me"

However, I just upgraded my phone to an iPhone 12 Pro Max. I am finding several issues when going into certain screens where the text at the bottom if the screen is “running off” the screen, and I am unable to get out of certain screens because the “X” that you press to close the screen is in the upper left hand corner and it is partially off of the screen and you are unable to push it (the iPhone 12 Pro Max screen is .2” larger, so an update is needed.)."

I’ve read that the database isn’t as big as MFP but I haven’t run into any problems with being able to track my food or scan barcodes. When I first started using the app I lost 8 pounds in the first few weeks, so I’m finally under 160lbs! I haven’t been very consistent recently but I’ve just picked it back up again tracking calories and staying under my daily goal. I also love how simple it is to track macros. Overall, I’ve been wanting to lose weight for YEARS and stop gaining 10lbs/year on average and this is the FIRST tool I’ve found that has actually helped me make progress. Only negative I have is the meals on the different plans can’t be changed so I can’t really do them because I’m allergic to shellfish (I could probably just substitute though LOL)"

Unlike most of the other “suggestive criticisms,” though, my chief complaint/wish is that there are never any “night shift mode” capabilities in health tracking. Many of us in healthcare like me and hundreds of other careers have had to switch their lives nocturnal. 24-hour gyms and grocery stores have helped, but there is still so much room for improvement! If there were just a way to tell the apps to switch from breakfast/lunch/dinner at 8-ish, 12-ish, and 6-ish to those equivalents during the night! Or for activity and sleep to be better tracked at the opposite “normal” time! Granted this isn’t something Lifesum offers at all, but this is such a missed opportunity from health apps!"
32,32,4,2019-03-14T13:17:22.000Z,shaetoday,Needs improvement,"I think overall it’s a good app. I can’t afford the premium features so I basically have to ignore the day ratings. You can’t customize the macro goals unless you have premium and mine are different from the ones they set for me. The one thing that really irks me is their meal rating system. It doesn’t teach indulgence in moderation, which I think is key to maintaining a healthy diet, and it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. If you eat one sweet thing it ruins your entire meal rating. For example: I had scrambled eggs and protein powder in coffee this morning — it gave both of those an excellent rating on their own, but didn’t give the meal as a whole a good rating because I hadn’t consumed enough calories. Then I had half a serving of honey vanilla Greek yogurt and it gave it a :| rating, which then ruined my whole meal rating. And you can get an explanation for why things are rated that way unless you pay for premium. I try to get good ratings all day so it really bugs me when I get a bad one. I’m starting to just not take them seriously."
33,33,4,2019-06-04T19:20:18.000Z,DesiraeC_6,Just What I Needed,"I’ve been struggling to hold myself accountable when it comes to eating healthy and exercising ever since I gave birth to my daughter last summer, but this app makes it possible to keep track of my calories, fat, protein and sugar intake on any given day, and keep track of my workouts and it has made a difference! The first 10 days of using it, I mostly focused on eating healthy and staying under my daily intake. I lost two pounds and have since incorporated working out in the past week and have lost an additional 1.5 pounds plus 1.25” off of my waist. My pants are beginning to get a little looser and my face is noticeably thinner as well. I’ve been using this app since May 17th and I am happy with my progress so far. I gave the app four stars, however, because I’m paying $21 for three months but the add-ons don’t seem worth the money. I’m grateful for them but they are things so could have figured out with a quick google search. There are also not a whole lot of vegetarian recipes and many of them are not the healthiest."
34,34,5,2020-01-21T11:15:37.000Z,AKGWL,Review and Comparison,"I’ve compared this to other top food logging and calorie counter apps over the last three weeks and believe this one to have the best interface and work best with my needs and goals. It works to keep me accountable and mindful of my choices without restricting anything. I like that it connects to my Apple devices and adjusts my available calories based on exercise (the more I exercise, the more I can’t eat)! That feature has been very helpful. The scan tool works mostly well but there have been several items not yet in their database. There is an option to help grow that if you take the time to enter in all the nutritional info on a package. The most difficult thing with this (and all the food logging apps) is entering in homemade food, e.g. the chicken noodle soup I made last Sunday... other than that, I give it 5 stars and will continue to use it. It’s  already had an impact on my lifestyle (and I’ve lost several pounds)!"

36,36,1,2019-08-02T15:29:02.000Z,EmeraldHayez,Totally Inaccurate,"Lifesum is beautiful and fun. But none of that matters because all the entries are inaccurate or straight up wrong. If I’m going to have the ease of using a barcode, why do I have to put in more work? If you want to be able to accurately measure and count calories, you should use grams. When I use grams on anything, the measurements are totally inaccurate. They’ll make something that should be 200 calories look like 12,000 calories. Or something that should be 600 calories will come out to 3 calories, all because of inaccurate measurements on this app. Even the “verified” entries are wrong. Sometimes I’ll Enter a meal and the calories won’t show up until I fully close the app and reopen. Today I tried to search for an item from McDonald’s, and all the entries were the meal without the biscuit. And even those entries didn’t match! I’ve tried to continue to use the app because I was conned in to paying for a full year. (NOTE: when it says $3/month it’s actually going to charge you for a whole year at one time.) Not worth it. I’ll take my losses and use an app that’s accurate and that doesn’t make me angry because everything is hard to track and everything is just plan WRONG."

The app design is visually appealing and really fun to use, which is important because calorie counting is not fun. This app makes it easy to ensure that you are meeting your goals."

The calories & names are all messed up & it’s very discouraging to see that a cup of Oat blenders w/ Honey cereal are supposedly ‘956 calories’, and that a Danamal is 10+ calories than it actually is. I shouldn’t have to find the exact calorie amount by doing math. The entire point of your app is as an easy way to track your diet, weight, progress, etc. What’s the point if you can’t even properly add up the total calorie intake??"

Like the other apps, data for food isn’t 100% accurate but it’s good enough. Also like other apps, with premium you can see grams of protein, carbs, etc; but if you want to see vitamins and minerals you’re out of luck. This is the cleanest, most elegant of the tracking apps out there m. I appreciate it."

43,43,4,2019-04-24T00:49:23.000Z,IT has Crystal,"It’s a good app, but there’s issues.","I really do like this app. Its colorful, positive, and helpful in tracking calories. However, if there is one thing that really ruins my experience, it’s that you cannot view the nutritional values. It is illegal for packaging companies to withhold nutritional facts, and chain restaurants have to offer nutritional values for their food as well in order to “help Americans be healthy”. So why is an app, specifically designed for dieting withholding that information unless you pay for it? I think this is actually quite unjust. Yes, they do display protein, carbs, and fat, however the rest is blocked. The second problem with this app is that there is limited choices for entries. What I mean, is that if you try to log an exercise, there are many that are not included so you must guess on the amount of calories you burned. Additionally, many of the food values and/or portions are incorrect, and many foods are still not on there."
44,44,5,2020-02-10T12:54:26.000Z,philament23,Fantastic,"This might be the first time I’ve ever written an app review but this app is amazing. As long as you’re diligent with inputting the food you eat, it keeps track of everything for you. Calories, protein, carbs, fat, etc. It tailors all of it to the specific diet you choose and how much weight (if any) you want to lose, based on your height, weight, and timeframe. Beyond that, it gives you recipes, weekly ratings (in premium version, but the free version is well worth the download too) on how balanced and healthy your diet is, what you can improve on, and even gives you additional trackers for the areas you’re working on. You get fun smiley faces to denote how healthy your food choices are. All in a wonderfully designed and eye pleasing package. They even include stickers too! I’ve already lost weight and feel better and I can sleep better at night being more aware of exactly what I’m eating. Can’t recommend this app enough. It’s changing my life!"
45,45,4,2020-08-23T21:45:14.000Z,SummyBug,"Great App, Could use some added features","I love this app and have been using it to track my food for a long time. I just wish there where better ways to add in my workouts? I feel like there’s not a lot of customization there and the list of workouts to choose from is very odd. I also feel like theres some issues with entering food, I can’t always find what I’m looking for and very often the things I eat don’t have ratings. I’m vegetarian and sometimes I feel that this app doesn’t understand that someone who is a vegetarian or vegan needs different things or nutrients than someone who eats meat. I also feel like the grading/motivation part of this app could use help. As someone who has struggled with eating disorders, the grading can make me feel bad about my eating choices. Other than those things, I think this app is probably the best among its competitors and it actually gives me insight on the food I’m putting into my body. It’s also very visually appealing and organized."
46,46,4,2019-07-30T01:57:56.000Z,shayleebby,Cool app but needs more user unique features,"Let me start off by saying, I really like this app in terms of calorie counting wise. I just need the app to stay consistent and update food options in real time. I love the barcode feature because I can keep track, step by step when I’m making my own meals. However, when I’m eating out, I would like the app to be ready to know and look up what I’m eating. It just makes it a little easier for the user to get an exact match to food while eating out. The other thing is workouts and calories burned. I wish the app would let you track workout videos and burned calories through trackers rather then estimating. It would be a really cool idea to insert a direct link to the video you did, so you can keep track of your fav workouts and closely monitor your progress with said workouts all in one app. Correct me if I’m wrong in thinking this way. Other than those issues I mentioned, it’s a pretty cool simple, app to get dieting on track!!"
47,47,3,2020-03-14T19:28:26.000Z,EPowell2013,Mixed feelings,"So overall I like the app, and considered switching from MyFitnessPal, however I have a few issues. I can’t seem to create a new food that isn’t in the database and there are several foods I’ve noticed that aren’t recognized. Since I count macros, adding the calories alone is not helpful for me and my goals."

I love that it doesn’t ask me a million times to sync my social media - I like my privacy! Lots of pros to this app, easy to learn layout, very beautiful design, lots of options for foods."

The food tracking component to the app itself is robust and easy to use. I have had almost no trouble finding the food I eat, despite having a very particular diet. Scanning barcodes makes it even quicker."

I love the heath rating system as well because it introduces a veritable some people don’t think about when they’re focused on the numbers of calorie counting. However I do think that the notification option could be improved. I saw an earlier review saying that daily weigh ins are not healthy, and I completely agree, due to minimal change day to day and fluctuating weight (if you have a cheat day, for example). I think that notifications such as reminders to drink more water would be way more beneficial, as I (and I know many others) always forget to drink enough. Also reminders to track food if you’ve forgotten to that day would be great. Besides this issue I really do love this app. I’ve noticed these reviews get replied to quite often which I really appreciate, so I’m hoping this one will get a reply as well!"

It shows me what I’m eating and helps me learn what I’m putting in my body vs what I need to put in my body. But some of the goals seem unrealistic. I chose the high protein plan as it gives me energy to workout and keeps me full longer, but it wants me to eat 32g of protein a meal and 97g of protein for a snack. I couldn’t handle it, eating that much protein made me feel awful and super full. I couldn’t even finish my protein shake, which is very uncommon for me. And a lot of the foods I eat aren’t recognized on the food searcher. I also wish I could do the thing with the meals but on the exercise option, like “what you did yesterday” instead of having to re-enter my exercise everyday. Overall I would recommend this to people who want to know more about healthy eating, but there are definitely some kinks that could be worked out."

I was 5’6” and 125 pounds, which is considered to be “normal”, but I noticed that my weight was only increasing and I started to gain a lot of weight in many areas of my body. I started using this app a month ago and I weighed myself this morning at 114 pounds. Turns out, the culprit for me gaining weight and feeling so terrible all of the time was my diet! Things I thought were healthy before were actually very unhealthy. LifeSum has shown me what is healthy and what is not, and it has also prevented me from overeating - something that I did all of the time. Thank you so much LifeSum! I feel much more energetic and more in shape after using this app. I now have a flat stomach and no double chin, so this app is a true miracle.

Even though I scanned the exact items I was using to try to make it more accurate, it was saying my bread had half the protein and double the calories is really has, then for my plant milk says it has 27 grams of protein instead of 10? Very confusing and completely wrong. It also gave a better rating to my vegan Caesar dressing than HALF of a small avocado and celery.. Also I put that my food preference was vegan and every single meal suggestion it gave me wasn’t even vegetarian, they were all meat? It’s also inaccurate for the amount of protein you need, it shows that I’m low in protein because it says I need just under 100 grams a day which is literally double what I need for my weight? I feel like I can’t trust it at all and it’s honestly annoying how even when you scan the item it doesn’t pull up the correct nutrition facts and the ratings are so off. Like Caesar dressing is really healthier than celery and avocado.. definitely not a good app. Disappointed."

The original reason I downloaded this app what is to integrate it with the Walgreens app in order to earn bonus points at that store. Once I open the app, I found it useless. I took all kinds of quizzes which were to determine my eating habits and to suggest diets. I can’t imagine why eating vegetables watch a week or fruits just three times a week would indicate a balanced diet. Then it offered to give me suggestions. After every quiz, in order to get the answers or suggestions or meal plans or diet suggestions I was directed to sign up to get the paid version. This app is a complete rip off. I don’t have to take the time to go onto my phone just to keep track of how many glasses of water I drink! I have chronic kidney disease and was looking for a few other suggestions. Since I have to pay for everything here, I’ll stick to the FREE Davita app. It’s easy to set your calorie goals (along with protein and other nutritional content). You don’t have to have CKD to use Davita, either. Their food database is enormous. Lifesum (free) is useless in conjunction with the Walgreens app."

Everything of interest is part of the premium version. Plans and recipes require a monthly subscription. Further macros beyond carbs, fats, proteins require a monthly subscription.

It has some great Keto recipes and gave me planned meals complete with a grocery list for the whole 3 weeks. I really like the look of this app, especially over MFP. However, I find myself unable to do all of the functions that I could in the former. Mostly, editing or even deleting a custom recipe/meal-- I can only add them not get rid of them. Most importantly however, there's issues transferring a tracked meal the app suggests from my paid meal plan into my food diary. The servings get all messed up and the nutritional information gets significantly reduced. This makes me go back and delete/""untrack"" the meal and input it manually, which defeats the point of the feature. I really want to like this app but unfortunately I will not continue using it after my paid trial ends. Hopefully it can be updated in the future."

68,68,3,2020-11-20T00:17:13.000Z,AlphaWithLove,Why can’t you delete meals or food?,The premise of this app is great and when it starts listening to Apple health to factor in your exercises it really sets itself apart. Our issue appears to be more of a bug than a missing feature: you can’t delete any meal once you add it. We are in a Keto focus and we cook all our meals from recipes we create (we have a personal menu). When we create a meal with all of the ingredients it exists in the “Meals” section as a choice we have from now on to enter into our diary any given day we may have chosen to eat that meal. But there are meals we made years ago when we tried this app once and didn’t know much about nutrition. And we can’t delete them. A meal just consisting of black beans is in there forever cluttering the list and it can’t be deleted. The same problem occurs in anything added in the food category. It makes daily use of this app cumbersome and overtime it will become so crowded that it will be unusable
69,69,2,2019-08-10T22:30:29.000Z,aretephora,Beautiful UI but not remotely functional,"Giving two stars for the UI. Very visually appealing. But not functional. Lots of basic issues that constrain functionality. 1) you must log water by 8.45 ounces and can’t change that. 2) if you choose one of their diets, you can’t edit the calories. I was on the 5:2 diet and it had me eating 1600 calories on non-fasting days. I’m doing 1400 calories, but there’s no way for me to change that. And none of their plans allow for different calorie goals for different days. 3) app crashes a couple times a day and I have to log out and log back in. 4) the food insights are very limited. They tell me my nutrients are imbalanced if my meal is a couple grams over/under with one macro. 5) most scanned foods come out with incorrect information. 6) can’t move foods from meal to meal or day to day. 7) doesn’t show you the foods you eat regularly, have scanned recently, or generally prefer over others. Even more issues, but this review is getting to long. Back to My Fitness Pal."

Problem is, more than half the time I go to search a food to add it to my meal or create a recipe, the search turns up blank. There’s no error message, just no results. And I’m usually searching simple things like “Apple” or “almond milk.”"
71,71,4,2018-04-24T00:20:25.000Z,Lee Lee37295,Great app with some annoying glitches.,"I love this app. It is very easy to use and track with for my strict keto diet. My main issue is with adding foods for the next day. I often meal prep and input my food the day before so I can plan for the day ahead at work. However, many times I think I am putting in the food for the next day but the app adds the food to the current day instead. It happens over and over again and it takes me twice as long as it should to meal prep. I really hope this can be fixed or an option is added which allows you to change the day and/or meal on the food itself (the weight watchers app allows this)."
72,72,4,2019-01-05T20:31:26.000Z,meeganmariee,Great but missing a few things,"I do really like the app all together. Easy to use, great esthetic, good options for recipes. I will say though I’m a little surprised there is no paleo option and it feels super focused on Keto. I’m paleo based, so while I wanted to try out the plan choices, I just stuck with the classic because they aren’t close enough. With options in recipes too, if they could add in an avoiding soy section, I’m sure a good portion of their users would appreciate it. I also wish I could customize the water tracker since I drink two 40 oz hydroflasks of water a day and it doesn’t really let me accurately track that. And also the macro counter would let me input my macro goal since it was over 100% according to the app.. I’m in a bulking stage, so it was a little frustrating having to adjust it just to track in the app. Overall though I still like it better than MFP."
73,73,3,2019-01-30T18:14:14.000Z,Lele Leon,It’s okay,"In terms of user friendly interface, it’s perfect. It’s very appealing and simple to use and i love the personalized diet plans which are the only positives it has over the other app I am comparing it to. In terms of everything else, I truly prefer MyFitnessPal. I hate the fact you can’t multi add foods when adding your meals for the day. The most irritating thing about this app is the lack of consistency/accuracy when tracking foods. It seems like most of the foods in this app aren’t verified and are completely based off of users creations. MyFitnessPal adds a healthy mix of both verified foods and user added meals. For example, I had Chipotle for dinner and I wish I could be able to choose ingredients with verified nutritional facts from the restaurant. Also, it’s unhealthy and irritating to be told to update your weight every single day. I did pay for the premium plan and so when that is over I’m heading back over to a MyFitnessPal."
74,74,5,2019-12-30T02:29:13.000Z,mommyyjughead,Best nutrition app out there!,"I can definitely say this is the best nutrition/logging app I have ever had. For a number of months I was in a bad relationship with food—I was a binger and a restricter. This app helped me overcome this so quickly. What's different about this app from others is that looks much more in-depth than most free nutrition apps. I recommend the subscription for the whole experience, but even without it, it's very helpful. I am now numerous weeks clean from binging because this app gives many more notes. It informs you for approximately how many calories you should be eating per meal, the balance of macros, and the nutrition/rating of food. It even gives you a complete rating for your meals and day! I've tried MyFitnessPal, but it never really gave as much info as this app. It really is a helpful app, and I completely recommend it!"
75,75,5,2021-01-28T03:32:02.000Z,Velma White,Less data but more useful than other apps,"I’ve tried all the big names in calorie tracking but this is the only app that actually encourages a healthy relationship with food, in my experience. With LifeSum, you get high-level overviews of what you’re eating along with easy, actionable ways to improve your diet. By contrast, with MFP and Cronometer, I would often get so caught up in the minute details that I wouldn’t know what to change in my diet. LifeSum strikes a much better balance of giving the details most people need without overwhelming you with data. I highly recommend LifeSum if you’re someone who gets obsessive when using other apps because I’ve found it to be much gentler on my mental health (although please talk to a doctor if you have a history of disordered eating because any kind of calorie counting can be touchy)"
76,76,5,2020-01-13T16:34:17.000Z,1Tina14,Learning how to use this is key!,"At first I gave this app a bad review because I honestly wasn’t informed about how to use it. I was having difficulty adding my own items and macro information and I thought you couldn’t. After getting some help, this app is seriously the best! All you have to do is scan a barcode and bam, all the info is in there and you can easily track what you’re eating and your macros. It’s also extremely easy to add your own items if they aren’t in the system, or if it’s a home cooked meal you made. I highly recommend this app! I’m trying to lose weight in the new year, and this has really opened my eyes to how much fat and sugar and crap I was eating that I thought was healthy. This easily allows me to immediately see and track the nutritional value of what I’m putting into my body. I love it!"

I really enjoy the looks of it, how fast it feels to log food and create meals. I have been eating keto, so I need my carbs to be low. You have the option of tracking net carbs, but sadly the data is not being processed correctly. For example any keto eater knows an avocado has a low amount of net carbs. about 4 per avocado. this app logs it as 17. it does not minus the fiber despite me confirming that I am tracking NET carbs. :/ so I cannot track my food. chia seeds it says a huge number of carbs. it does not minus the fiber. so basically if you need to know your true macros then this database is not so good. I redownloaded carb manager app today and wow the avocado has less than 4 grams net carbs. now I know I can eat it and not worry. and chia seeds is accurate on that app (carb manager app) too so I recommend switching to a better app and for the makers of this one to fix the data so it is not only an app with good looks. thank you."

For one run it shows three activities, so that a run that might have burned 300 calories shows as 900+ calories in the app. I used to be able to delete the duplicate entries, but they took away that option in one of the last couple “upgrades”. Now if I try to delete it just takes me into the exercise screen."

81,81,4,2018-06-02T15:50:16.000Z,KyleB1400LbC*,Very good app. Easier to navigate than Myfitness pal,App has a great look to it with fluid changing colors and cartoonish characters and animated vegetables. It’s very motivational and clicking on the water icons to report your hydration instantly gives a feeling of satisfaction. You can take pics of food to help you figure out calorie content. My only complaint is that the search feature is very lacking. It can be difficult to find what you are in the apps recorded selection of food. This makes the barcode feature important but so many things have not been scanned by other users that you often have to stop and take time to fill out the information for a “new” item of food yourself. This issue will go away when more people start using the app however. I found this app when apple recommended it on its health app.

I’m using it to evaluate what food I intake, the nutritional content of those foods, and how I can eventually make better choices. HOWEVER, if you are expecting to use Apple’s Health app to sync data from Lifesum (which the app claims to do), then skip it. While Lifesum does record and sync data to Health, its consistency is not reliable at all. Data may sync to the Health app for a couple of days, but for some reason, it will skip other days entirely. But more annoyingly, on days that it decide to sync data, it will sometime not sync every category which you have selected (i.e. water intake, sodium, sugar, etc.). Additionally, the app will sometimes glitch and erase data which you have recorded INSIDE of the app itself. It’s unfortunate because I really enjoy this app and it has contributed greatly to changing some bad aspects of my eating habits. Hopefully these issues are addressed because the app is worth it."

Also, the whole ”taking a picture of your food” thing is so pointless it never works and I have to change its predictions anyways. Instead, can I just take a picture of the recipe I used then enter in how many servings it makes and state how much I ate, viola! I have been so frustrated with that. I will change my rating later because I really do enjoy the app it just isn't quite perfect yet. Thanks for reading."

The data is now all messed up. First i noticed that the calories per meal didn't equal the number of calories left for the day... then one day i opened the app and all my data was just gone. It didn't remember my goals, it was giving me ads to purchase premium even though it says in the settings its still registering me as a premium member... it wont grab the data for my weight properly from the health app... and right now, i open the app, haven't used it all day no data at all in it and its saying i can only eat 6 more calories today.......??? The whole thing is just all screwy. Im just going to do a reset of my data on the account and see if that helps me until they fix the issue but... yeah, this bug is making this app completely useless to me right now."

The free version is nice for basic food tracking purposes, but if you are really looking for an easy way to learn more about your health GET THE PREMIUM VERSION! This is coming from someone who has tried numerous diets and researched healthy eating immensely for over a year. This has made it so much easier to eat balanced meals. I start off with what I know I want to eat and it will tell me if I need to add more fat or protein and what’s good and bad about the food. I’ve been using the premium version for 3 days and have already learned so much! The life scores are very motivating. I see myself sticking with this for a while. It DID take me a while to figure out the layout of the app. But give it time, you won’t regret it!"
87,87,4,2021-01-21T19:21:07.000Z,koathanger,Works well enough,"This is great for tracking calories and planning out meals in advance. As long as you have a good scale and measuring cups you’ll be able to get a pretty accurate calorie count. I tend to ignore the food ratings it gives me, I’ve made veggie stir frys and things that I know are healthy but it will give me a poor rating because there isn’t enough calories or protein or whatever. That’s fine, I don’t rely on those. My only major issue is that it doesn’t show calories burned while sleeping, sitting, etc from my Fitbit in the calories burned section, it adds them to “calories left” so I have to switch between apps to figure out my caloric deficit. Also, I can’t manually add workouts to increase my life score because it will add calories that I didn’t actually burn, so I guess I have to ignore the life score as well. Not really sure why I bought the premium."

I need to delete a “body measurement” and I can’t. It’s asking what units so I put the units because it was already in inches and there was no input for my number. So now my units are numbers. Says my hips are 37 37. Secondarily I can’t add the photo to my snack I just made a meal, after I just took the photo, I wouldn’t have thought to take it twice in a row/ there are a lot of things about this I might need to press for a refund for like ..... what meal plan? There are recipes to chose from ? So I'm confused that’s not a meal plan lol am I not understanding or is there a setting to put on. It keeps asking me the quiz like no I chose already I want it all laid out for me. Might as well use my fitness pal it is much more user friendly these apps are annoying as is. I really want to continue to use this app though because I already invested the past two hours into it."

However, I wish it were possible to customize the plans a tiny bit further by being able to select how many meals or snacks I have in a day (having the choice to modify plans to have 3-5 smaller meals and/or snacks in a day would be amazing). One of my prescriptions is an appetite suppressant, so I sometimes find it really difficult to feel comfortable and not too full after eating a meal, unless I take about an hour to eat it (which is something I simply don’t have time for). I also wish that plans could automatically adjust macro counts if I have a super-high protein/lower fat or carb meal in the day. But, I have to say, this app makes it SO easy to know what’s good and what’s not-so-good for me and why, and I love it nonetheless."

I thought I would be able to at least see recipes. And, oh, yes, you can see recipes - the title, nutrition, calories- a teaser!! You can’t actually see the ingredients or instructions without a Premium membership!!!! In fact, you can’t do anything, but manually add items, without an annoying pop up demanding a membership! What a waste of my time. Now I have to go find out how to delete permissions in Facebook. If you want money, then TELL ME that the free version is useless. I could have found many other apps or ways to manually add tracking data. I am not a serial 1 Star review.  I’m more of a serial 5 Star reviewer, but I’m sick of apps acting like there is a free version that offers what’s in the advertisement (and Premium stands for extra, valuable services.) The Premium in this app means you can’t do any of the advertised services without paying! That’s not what Premium means."

It gave me a 15 week period and I thought “okay that’s reasonable”, but then I started using it and it’s motivated me so much I’ve lost 6.2 lbs, it’s been 2 weeks. I honestly wouldn’t be nearly as motivated to use it if it wasn’t such an enjoyable of an experience. The design is flawless and the little icons are adorable. I love using the barcode scanner, then I don’t have to figure out if I actually ate what I logged. The life rating is really motivational, and ever since I had a day tracker for fruit and a weekly tracker for seafood, I’ve been eating lots more of those."

Unlike MyFitnessPal, which is the easiest food logging I’ve ever done, Lifesum is not only difficult in finding the food you’re trying to log (they don’t have the database that MFP has), but the serving sizes and entering the amount you’re eating is more often in grams instead of cups or the MUCH easier options on MyFitnessPal. A lot of the nutrition information is also wrong, meaning that I have toggle with the “amount” of food that I ate in order to get the calorie count correct. I also don’t love the often negative feedback that pops up if you occasionally eat something that’s non-nutritious. Because of this, I’ll likely be canceling my subscription at the end of the 3 months and looking back at MyFitnessPal."

Got suckered into the 3 month subscription by all of these false reviews (or perhaps completely clueless people). It allows you to scan items and just move along to add them to your food tracking. However serving sizes are wrong, calories wrong, sugars, proteins, fats—everything. It’s different things for different items but when you look it over there is always something that is off. You literally need to sit there and go through every item even serving size, if it is tsp or tbsp to make sure the scanned item is right. I Deleted the app. I’ll be asking for my money back but this trash app and it’s lazy developers will probably tell me I can’t..just like they can’t get the correct nutritional info off a label. These apps are total gimmicks. My back up plan after “being had” is salad and running around—could have spent the subscription on vegetables."

Its integration with other apps like mySugar is a great idea, but it’s limited in some ways. 1) The inability to make necessary adjustments to information such as meal time. This is an unnecessary constraint on a paid app. I use lifesum to track and plan my meals along with my insulin intake, and this restriction on specifying meal times makes much of my data charts worthless. 2) When exporting the carb counts to other apps, it automatically excludes carbs that it has not verified, even if I have entered the numbers myself. There should at least be the option to include all data. 3) The app is often buggy. It crashes upon opening, and food input sometimes simply doesn’t work. Clicking to add an item results in a blank field that then disappears. A paid app should not have these problems."

I still use it though because I have a few more pounds to lose and then I will see how it does with gaining muscle mass. I just love the interface and the ratings as smiley faces, it makes it simple to use. I just want to say thank you to the app developers because of you all my life is tremendously better."

This app is great for tracking and recommending certain things for my goal weight. However, when I first logged my morning fatty coffee as my breakfast, it gave me the “okay” symbol. I don’t pay for premium, but it seems to me that the picture of the fruit and bread are recommended as a “happy face”. As someone who is going to school for nutrition and has a few friends and family who have tested all sorts of things; with different weights, metabolisms, and health, we all can agree that carbs and even protein are not good for us in the least by not raising our insulin too much. I’m not keto, but I have everything in moderation. So I think that this should be updated or have more research put into it other than what the government or food industry thinks or portrays as “healthy”."

Contacted support for each of these with a wait time of over a WEEK for initial response each, and the responses weren’t helpful. The food database is lacking (still new I guess compared to my fitness) - A lot of the items are way off on accurate nutrition, and it allows you to flag them - had to flag a lot. The barcode scan works pretty well. The app does look and feel nice. But it doesn’t come close to Fitness Pal food database and functionality and lack of issues... canceled subscription for this and renewed my fitness pal membership - works flawlessly now.

First, the recommended daily meal plan in the keto burn have more carbs and or protein or calories than i need, so if i go with the recommended meals i would be exceeding my limits of carbs or protein, the recipes are great i like them but they don’t suit my plan. I mean i can choose only one and plan the rest of the meals of the day myself. Second, sometimes when i log food it counts more carbs/protein/calories then i have to close the app and open it again or delete the food and re-log it again. And the numbers keep changing inaccurately sometimes. Third, i can’t decide the amount of water in my glass or bottle my self because the bottles we have in my country are either 330ml or 600ml.

Eating healthily includes a lot of cooking at home for me and being newer to living on my own, I’m following lots of new recipes and sometimes it’s hard to find something similar to track and logging individual ingredients or recipes can be very time consuming. One great app I’ve found for healthy recipes is Mealime. Definitely recommend integration because they list full detailed nutritional facts and tons of healthy and easy recipes. Even a simple way to allow Apple health to write food entry data combined with in app tracking because most recipe apps will allow you to track to Apple health."

The app deleted all my previous data so I couldn’t see what I added a month ago, you use to be able to go back a year and see all data. It has reset my updated weight over and over again making it impossible to keep track. The app deletes food you’ve already logged for the day so that you have to keep adding it. You try to scroll down past lunch area and it gets stuck to where you can’t see dinner or snacks.  Now today I tried to log my breakfast and lunch and the app won’t even respond. You go in to add the food and click ok and it doesn’t register at all. The app even deleted half of yesterday’s meals.

After several emails to customer service I still have not received a refund. It’s fine, I don’t need the money back, but in my opinion customer service is lacking. The application is great I loved how it graded food so I knew which foods are good and which foods were bad but the bugs cause me to cancel my premium membership.

I absolutely recommend the free version at the beginning, you will fall in love with the app and its features so much that you will need to buy the premium that it’s just like having a personal coach 24/7. In the past I had very bad experience with another app that took my money and never heard back from them. Even if I ask for rectification. Lifesum is an honest app they don’t take your money for nothing. You pay when you want and they give you the best they can offer that is top.

It’s so easy to track your meals and water, I really appreciate the wide range of excellent recipes and that you can add the ingredients to a shopping list. The only thing I wish that this app had was a feature where you could make your own recipes. I do a lot of cooking and have used calorie counting apps before that let you add all of the ingredients to a custom dish or recipe along with how many serving that you prepared and calculates the calories that you consumed per serving. I haven’t seen this feature on this app so I just enter the calories per serving as a custom item but it doesn’t include any of the nutritional information. I really appreciate that the keeps track of and sets goals for your nutrition but I feel like when I prepare my own recipes I miss out on that feature."
114,114,3,2020-03-16T02:39:06.000Z,IᑎᗪII✨,"Without Premium, there’s no point.","I initially downloaded this app because I wanted to lose a bit of weight and monitor my calorie and water intake, but after having this app for a few weeks, it has no purpose. The app gave me a suggestion of approximately 1700 calories per day and 8 glasses of water. On most days, I like almost all of what I eat-with the exception of foods that aren’t listed-and at times I find myself going over the calorie limit, or not drinking enough, or getting a less than satisfactory rating on some of my meals, and what I’ve noticed is that the app recognizes this, but does nothing to help me do better. Even a more in depth analysis of what you ate that day is restricted unless you have premium. Over the past couple of weeks I’ve formed some unhealthy habits that the app recognizes, but does nothing to help me break the habits, or give me tips to eat healthier."
115,115,4,2019-09-05T02:58:11.000Z,Carne-Gigante,Great app with a few personal drawbacks,"I’ve used this app for a little while now and I’m really enjoying it! The layout is nice, the style is sleek, and it’s helping me track everything!"
116,116,4,2021-02-28T16:34:30.000Z,Ritch rich,Good but needs work,"I really love this app and I love how easy it is to keep track of macros. However, keeping track of some foods is really difficult because the serving sizes just don’t make sense on the app so I’m stuck either weighing everything I eat or doing complicate conversions. My fitness pal is much easier to use because there are many different serving size options. My main point is that when I scan some barcodes, none of the serving sizes come up that are on the packaging. When scanning a barcode it should come up with the same serving size that is on the packaging. It’s hard to choose which app to use because I’m trying to gain muscle mass and both apps aren’t really amazing at it. Please fix the serving size issue. I don’t want to have to do a bunch of math every time I eat."
117,117,4,2019-10-28T19:04:42.000Z,A Sick Kid,More features,"I normally do not write reviews, but I figured I would add some commentary/suggestions and also what I have found that I do like at this point. The app is pretty easy to use, has a decently large database of foods you can search/scan and can be motivating. However, I would LOVE if there was a breastfeeding/pregnancy feature. Pregnant people are meant to GAIN weight and apps like this definitely don’t encourage that, even if it’s necessary for a developing fetus. While breastfeeding, you also can’t lose weight too quickly or else you risk completely tanking your milk supply. I’ve tried to use the suggested amount of calories but every time I do that, I notice the amount of milk I produce plummets quite quickly."
118,118,4,2020-04-21T18:18:51.000Z,Biggest Taylor Swift fan!,So close to perfect,"This is a really fantastic and easy to use app for anyone who’s seriously committed to their diet. I recently started a strict keto diet and this has been invaluable for helping me keep very close track of exactly what I’m consuming. There’s even a feature that can tell you what percentage of your daily intake has been composed of protein, carbs, and fat! The only way this app falls a little short is it sometimes just doesn’t work. Often times I’ll log a food in, and then it simply does not calculate into the log, as if I didn’t just go in and take that action. It gets a little annoying since it’s pretty common and the whole point of this app is to successfully log my food. But with all the other benefits this has to offer and the attractive design, I’m so grateful for lifesum!"
119,119,2,2019-07-11T20:51:00.000Z,Mellypepper85,Too Much Tied Into Premium,"I was looking for an app to replace MyFitnessPal, which is a good app but boring and outdated. This looked like a winner at first, it has a great layout and design. But there are features that require membership when they should be basic. The two biggies are 1. No daily nutritional information (I have potassium issues and I need to see that info) and 2. You can’t modify your daily intake (macros) based on your needs/desire without paying for Premium. For instance, it locks you into a “Classic Plan” that has macros and a calorie count that doesn’t fit with my current lifestyle and I can’t adjust them because it’s locked into a membership. With most other apps, including MyFitnessPal, these options are both included for free and pretty basic features. This app is basically a pretty calorie tracker without Membership. I guess if you want your meal plan and dietary needs dictated to you then this app is for you."

My goal with Lifesum is to help me eat more, since I under eat a lot. While my under eating problems have been getting better since using Lifesum, there is one bug that kinda annoys me. Whenever I log a meal, it says that it is a few calories under, which is a really helpful aspect of this app. Sometimes, this feature bugs out, and gives the incorrect number of calories under. For example, if I log 200 calories of food, it will say that I am 200 calories under the minimum goal, which isn't true. Hopefully this bug will be fixed soon, because it's really driving me crazy."
121,121,3,2019-03-29T17:25:11.000Z,Serendigital,"Sadly, requires reading glasses","I want this app! But I’m not willing to carry reading glasses. This style of typography is OK for print publications, because you get in the habit of putting reading glasses on the coffee table. But, with an app you use for a few seconds, multiple times per day, reading glasses aren’t an option. Sure, I could use Apple’s accessibility zoom, but again, with something you need to see, multiple times per day, it’s not a viable option. Just design it to be legible out of the box. I have to believe that even your younger customers will appreciate better legibility. Trust me, it can be done tastefully."

Other this issue I really the free version of the app. When you sync it the your Apple Health app it will bring across all the food nutrients you consume. I will wait till this is fixed to determine if I will pay for the extras.

It allows me to find new recipes and try new diets to see what works for me. Also really love syncing it with my health app to show how many calories I’ve burned with walking. Two complaints though if you choose the 5:2 diet, it will only show you low calorie recipes for those 500 calorie days. However, I want healthy recipe ideas for every other day too. In addition, you’re not allowed to adjust the calories you need in this diet. It wants me to do 1550 calories 5 days out of the week to “get a better day rating” but that would be overeating for a person my size! Hopefully you can fix because I love trying the regular recipes as well as the 5:2 recipes."
125,125,4,2019-12-27T06:40:33.000Z,jelly...33,Too much premium,I love this app because it is so easy and that it helps in a lot of ways but the reason why I don’t like it is because that there isn’t much for a person who doesn’t want to pay for premium to do. Say for the recipes all of them are for the premium members. I am a person who likes to try things but I didn’t want to spend my money on this because I know I’m not getting much from it. So I would just like there to be more things for people who aren’t going to pay for the premium member ship. I know the whole point in having a member ship is for a person to purchase it and have everything but I just feel like you should give a bit more things for people who don’t pay because almost everywhere I like it pops out with paying for the premium.
126,126,3,2020-08-27T22:18:36.000Z,Wagszilla,Solid app; rough around edges,I went from LoseIt to MFP to Lifesum.

128,128,1,2020-10-11T17:16:40.000Z,CorgiRunner,Regret I paid for premium,"I really want to like this app because it is very attractive, unlike MFP.  However, it needs a lot of work, especially the recipe function.  First, I found a lot of mistakes in the database, too few/many calories etc, and no way to report errors, unlike MFP.   Next, the recipe function keeps making the app crash and when I finally get a recipe entered, there is no way to edit it later.  For instance, you use a different brand a cheese the next time you make it, you can’t correct the calories/nutrition. Next, there is no website availability so you have to enter recipes in the app and personally, I can type much faster in a keyboard than a mobile device.  Last, but not least, there is no recipe import function so you do HAVE to enter each ingredient and instructions by hand, unlike MFP.  So while MFP may not have the glitzy, cutesy presentation, it is HANDS DOWN a much more functional app even without paying for their premium membership."
129,129,1,2019-08-21T11:49:07.000Z,amy9renee,Premium = fraud,"Invested in premium thinking it was the way to go per the way it’s sold, 1: being after the purchase was made I was charged the full amount, yet when the subscriptions are displayed it makes it seem like you’re paying a small amount for the months you choose. Not the full price!"
130,130,1,2018-02-24T18:56:50.000Z,emztuck,Useless compared to my fitness pal,"I started using this app because I thought the interface was more aesthetically pleasing than my fitness pal. I was so excited that I even bought the yearly subscription. After a day I regretted it. The food database is incomplete and not accurate. For example I was tracking for a few days and was wondering why it said my fats were so high...it said a serving of grilled chicken breast had 20 grams of fat.....the scanner doesn’t work either so you’re out of luck if you can’t find. The “rating” gets irritating as well. If you’re trying to center your carbs around when you workout it’ll constantly tell you that you’re off track because your macro distribution. Would also like to see an app that has the option of Meal 1, Meal 2, Meal 3, Meal 4, Meal 5 etc. rather than breakfast lunch dinner snack. Will be going back to my fitness pal. I just wish I hadn’t spent 50 dollars on a year subscription (which adds near no value to the app)"

That’s the most basic functionality I need out of a fitness app. I can’t properly keep track of what I’m eating with a quick look at the app when the preset daily requirements are so far off.
132,132,4,2018-07-16T13:52:34.000Z,mahshell,Great but could be better,"Update: Net carb tracking has been added and that is awesome- thank you. My only complaint left is that there are still only a few diets to choose from. Please add more, particularly intermittent fasting. 🙂"

134,134,2,2018-12-19T18:06:13.000Z,Sgabel,Unreliable Diet Information & Poor Functionally,"The app itself has a very nice layout. However the functionality seems to be very wonky. For example, one day it says my calorie intake should be1650, the next day it say it should be 500. Not sure what to make of this. Based off two other apps I’ve tried, my goal intake is around 1250 calories. The other thing I noticed was for the “easy” Keto Diet, it was showing 80% carbs, 5% fat and 15% protein. Anyone familiar with the Keto Diet knows this is incorrect. Finally, one feature I liked was the 3 week weight loss plan that would show menus for the week. The day after I paid for the premium version, this feature was no where to be found. So far I have found this app to be very confusing and not at all accurate with the information it is supposed to track which is diet. Carb Manager is great for those focused on the Keto Diet and MyFitnessPal for all other diets."
135,135,5,2020-06-22T17:45:29.000Z,Casantrc,IF not accounted for,"I recently started keto up again and have decided to add some intermittent fasting, meaning I’m skipping breakfast. This app doesn’t have a way to acknowledge this and therefore their “tips” about nutrient recommendations are off, since they’re counting on me eating three meals a day and not just two. I wish this was an option."
136,136,4,2020-01-24T16:49:13.000Z,K9.kil,"Love, but","Wow, what an easy app to use. I do have the paid version. This is one of many tracking apps I’ve used before, but this is the first I loved so much that I paid for the premium version. I love the idea of the plans, BUT, I so, so wish I could swap out a single ingredient in each recipe. I follow a vegan diet, but the plan offered for vegans is very limited. Instead, I like to follow other plans, but swap out proteins or cheeses for vegan options. I would LOVE to see an option where I can go into each recipe and swap these out rather than having to fill in the whole recipe myself just because of one substitution. This would also help when making sure I’m getting as much protein/calories as the meat option would have. Please add this feature; it would help the app become more vegan-friendly!"
137,137,5,2021-01-08T16:06:18.000Z,I don't know...Username?,Overall Such a Great App!,"I really enjoy this app! I initially downloaded it to help count macros because I am vegetarian and sometimes struggle to ensure I get enough protein every day. This app helps keep my protein intake (and fat and carbs) top of mind. One thing I wish I saw more was I take of other key nutrients - like fruits and veggies, which currently are just counted for carb intake. Since all carbs aren’t created equal, it would be helpful if carbs such as breads and pasta were differentiated from sweet potatoes and greens, for instance. But, a great thing it does do is account for added and naturally occurring sugars, so that helps a bit with fruit sugar vs pasta, packaged goods, etc. I also love the barcode scan function. All in all, I plan to use this app for a long time. Good work!"
138,138,1,2021-06-26T05:17:41.000Z,Caligrl24,Very disappointed,"I am so beyond sick of fighting with this app. If you care anything about tracking your macros correctly- go with myfitnesspal. I’m frustrated that I upgraded to premium only to hate this app so much, I dread using it. Everything I scan- has the wrong info and often times the barcode is associated with the wrong food item. So I edit each time, carefully putting in the exact info off the food packaging, only to have it tell me calories etc are wrong and not allow me to save it! Why bother?  I also hate that it won’t allow me to track other things, like vitamin content- except for potassium. Also a joke that it won’t allow you to remove food items you create, or most of all, edit them. Which is exactly why you see so many duplicate items created by ppl on here. I know I sometimes change my recipes up, so why not allow me to change it on here?  This app has been around too long to be this dysfunctional."
139,139,2,2021-03-03T22:01:21.000Z,Rosaa,Beautiful app but for targeted users only,"Hello, I have been a premium (paying) user of this app, but I had to cancel my membership. It’s a  beautiful user interface, which was the initial appeal for me as a user. However, without the ability to access simple data from my food intake, this app is not as useful as I would hope for it to be when tracking more than just macros. Calcium, magnesium, and so many other minerals that should be easily imported on the developer side (I am familiar with development), but somehow, even with a user forum requesting such simple tracking, and for years now, this data is not available to users. The alternative for tracking not just macros but the various minerals we need to survive and thrive is My Fitness Pal, which is free, for my purposes at least. I will happily return as a user when these simple yet essential pieces of data are shared and easily accessible as well."
140,140,4,2018-01-18T19:17:16.000Z,Gymgoer4813,Love it- but a few places for improvement,"The app is beautiful - which may be shallow but the design has certainly made me want to engage with the app far more than other food tracking apps I’ve used before. The reminders and prompts are helpful and motivating, and Lifesum offers a lot of easy-to-select plans (keto, 5:2) that I was interested in. I’ve paid for the 6 month subscription and am using the 5:2 plan. However, the food database to search from is far more spotty than Myfitnesspal and I’m putting most of my food in manually, and I am unable to move around my fast days throughout the week to account for my schedule, which causes some really discouraging feedback from the app when I’m either blowing my fast day calories or way under eating on a non-fast day."
141,141,5,2018-01-19T15:25:22.000Z,EmJai84,Keeps me accountable,"For the past week and a half of using this app, I have logged everything I eat from just a small snack to my meals.  It’s hard because I work overnights and I log my dinners as breakfast and so on but it does help me maintain accountability of my food.  I like being able to find the foods I eat from popular restaurants to foods I prepare at home.  My favorite part of the app is being able to scan the barcode of the food I prepare and input my portions."
142,142,4,2018-04-26T11:17:30.000Z,jadeycakes777,Overall amazing,Overall I think this app is amazing. I love the reminders and the weight tracker. I love the label scanning and entry capabilities. I love that you can track for different types of diets. Where I think this fell short is in the Keto diet tracking area. I track net carbs and yes it does track them to a certain degree. I occasionally buy low carb treats with three and under in the net carb department they are higher carbs but the majority of carbs are sugar alcohols which should be subtracted from the overall carbs just like fiber to get the net carb total. Like I said overall an amazing app just needs a little tweaking for net carbs to calculate correctly. I should add that I don’t buy apps but I did purchased this for the three month timeframe to try it out and will definitely be purchasing for the next time frame!
143,143,3,2019-01-15T14:54:54.000Z,emmytobias,Wish the food entries were more accurate,"I like that this app allows me to make low carb/keto choices without judging me for consuming too much fat (*cough*MFP*cough*). I also like the premium feature of following a plan with recipes and guidance.  The app is beautiful in design. But I feel like if I’m going to pay for a food/diet journal app when there are sooo many free ones to pick from, the food entries need be accurate. I find myself fixing a lot of foods and barcodes in this database. And making a food a favorite should be right there on the nutrition facts breakdown—it’s not straightforward how to access recents or favorites. If I hadn’t paid for a 3mo subscription, I probably would have returned to another app by now for the convenience of a user-verified and more accurate database. A little more tweaking on the UX and accuracy of this app and it will be the bomb."

146,146,3,2020-06-22T05:54:57.000Z,Enthusiast🚗,Overall Look & Test,"I like this app, but the downside is it doesn’t have all exercises their are so you can add to exercises on the list. This makes it difficult to track on dieting. I’ve had this app just 2-3 days of premium subscription and I feel it’s just not for me. The app isn’t really accurate on intake on calories. I’ve already paid for the subscription for a year, so it’s a waste of my money now which I paid for a year. The amount of water someone should take is helpful. Also, for someone to be using this, you have to have a decent income to buy most of the healthy products suggested to stay on track of diet plans. For myself I’m a student, so this is kind of difficult since I don’t make that much while going to school with a part time job. Overall, it’s a good app for a little more experience users."

Since it is the summer I decided that I might have more time to be able to track my food and activity. I re-downloaded Lifesum and after I signed in it brought me to a page that wanted me to confirm that I had read the he updated policies. The screen was buffering so I couldn’t read it and it wouldn’t even let me click ok to move on. Thus went on for a while so I deleted the app and re-down loaded the app. It still didn’t work. This has been happening for a day now and I would really like to be able to use Lifesum. It may be an issue on my end but I am not sure. If I could get a response that would be much appreciated. Thanks.

It is by far my favorite calorie tracking app. I have one problem with the app and if you could fix it it would be great. Lifesum offers 4 places to submit meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and snacks. There are only 3 main meals that should be of large portions and a really small snack. However, I eat more meals but in smaller portions and the way of submitting your food when you eat like me gets difficult. If you could maybe make the app more customizable regarding how many meals you eat it could be helpful. I have the premium version of Lifesum and I am really enjoying it!😁I really hope you take into account my recommendation"

While there’s a lot to like about Lifesum, the app has many flaws. Mine has not synced with Apple Health since mid-December, despite several reinstallations as instructed by customer support. It displays my calorie count as the next day, for some reason. And the food search needs work. Entering something as standardized as a Chipotle order involves searching through dozens of entries for the same ingredient, all with different calorie counts. I’ve tried editing foods to correct them, but that doesn’t seem to work either. All in all, Lifesum is better than the My Fitness Pal app, but it needs work. If they can’t resolve these issues when my subscription is up, I will not be renewing."

I was excited for the vegetarian option but they don’t do nearly anything for it. The picture taking ability is always faulty and is not worth the time. Ultimately the only cool thing about premium is measuring all of your nutritional intake—but like i said, unless you take the time ALWAYS to correct the info, it’s incorrect."

I also LOVED the mini milestones they offered of 3-5 pounds. I loved hitting those milestones and felt like a bigger deal to me than just hitting the next 5 or 10 pound mark on a scale. Also, at some point they lost my progress and said I had only lost 2 pounds, which was really disappointing to me. It was very helpful for me to look back on the chart going back many months to see the steady progress toward my goal. I decided not to pay for premium again this year and deleted the app. Developers, if you are out there, please bring back the little milestones for users again, and make sure their progress data doesn’t get lost between updates."
161,161,2,2018-08-28T01:04:06.000Z,E😍😂👍😁💩😫😝👍😅,"Great start, needs work","I downloaded this app, after seeing a YouTuber use it. She said that you could use it to find recipes, even for people with dietary restrictions, which is right up my alley. As someone with IBS and allergies, I constantly need to be recording my food, and is also constantly looking for good healthy recipes around my restrictions, I though this could help me. After signing up and spending a little time on the app I realized that you needed to pay for premium to be able to use the recipes, which was an instant turn off, as that was the main reason I downloaded this app. I wish the recipes were free, because I would actually use this app, but I’m deleting it, as it is of no use for me anymore. I think that this could be a really great app if everything useful about it was for premium. I hope the makers of this app take this into consideration."

I am logged in, linked my watch to import activity, set up my personal information etc. Everything looks great. Then, come lunch time, I go to add my food and suddenly the app has changed my fitness goal, is no longer importing my watch data and I have to go through the entire setup process Again. Fast forward to dinner, SAME THING."
163,163,2,2019-04-22T00:44:55.000Z,cbrackenak,Back to having a lot of bugs,April 2019...This is probably my fourth revision of the review in almost a year. Bugs get resolved then come back.  Now I can’t change the plan to gain weight and it is not adding my daily calories burned back to the diet though it is properly set up to do so.  Bugs seem to last a month or so before the resolve them; then they come back when they “fix” something else.
164,164,4,2019-05-01T19:53:20.000Z,hidenseek96,Really great but would change a bit,"So I love this app: big library of foods/barcodes in its library, great focus on macronutrients, the suggestions on how to increase my “life score” and I especially love the meal/food ranking smiley faces as motivation. But I would like to see a space where I can upload progress pictures along with my weight and the ability to turn off weight log reminders because I’m personally not big on tracking what the scale says or setting a “goal weight” when I’m just focusing on gaining muscle and eating healthier. I also prefer using my Fitbit to track exercise/other healthy habits so I wish they synced up on a bit more information than just a weak exercise total because it’s annoying to enter my food/water twice."
165,165,1,2019-05-31T22:38:56.000Z,poopiesinyurrbutt,Horrible Updates,"I had previously LOVED this app. I bought the premium subscript, and I had absolutely no problems with syncing data from Apple health, Fitbit (my main step tracker since I don’t carry my phone with me around at work), and lifesum. But this newest update is absolute garbage. I reached out to lifesum support and followed their recommendation to delete and reinstall the app. However, now the app is choosing to import my Fitbit data for random days! So now it looks like I have a ton of days where I ate hundreds of calories over my limit because it is missing my Fitbit data (I consistently reach 10k steps nearly every day). I have tried everything listed in the FAQ and nothing works. I feel as if I have lost all of the progress and work I’ve put into this app and my lifestyle for months now .... I am tempted to just delete this app and go back to myfitnesspal. Hopefully you guys in app development will figure this out soon!!!"
166,166,5,2020-12-09T16:34:43.000Z,Pezzzio,Great App,"It’s sleek, elegant, and relatively easy to use (compared to other food tracking apps I’ve tried). There’s a bit of a learning curve, but spend 10 minutes just playing around with the app and you should get the gist of everything."
167,167,1,2020-09-21T17:57:23.000Z,Porkchop Express Trucking,Are you kidding???,"Give us your personal information, then pick a plan. Don’t worry, they don’t show you anything really on the basic plan. Literally you can look at some meals, and you get a free workout and meal diary... that is it. If you go with the premium you get recipes and tons of other perks. The dilemma for myself and so many others is that I have such a restricted diet I don’t know if your app allows all my preferences. I am not signing up for anything without knowing what EXACTLY I am getting in return. $30 to hope that you can provide the recipes I can actually eat??? Pass. This hopefully works for many who do not have serious restrictions but for those that do you are asking us to throw our money on a very unlikely bet."
168,168,3,2021-08-14T16:10:10.000Z,LatteChk,Love most of it but can be glitchy,This app is so fun to use and I appreciate the food and macro recommendations so much. The database of foods is super helpful and makes it easier to use.
169,169,1,2020-10-07T19:42:45.000Z,Pleroo,Great idea but buggy. Not actively supported.,I used Lifesum to lose over 60lb a couple years ago and loved it. It synced my activity from my Apple Watch pretty well and the interface is so much cleaner than other free or paid options.
170,170,4,2017-12-11T23:50:05.000Z,Maya the Bee,"Beautiful app, ratings make no sense","It's a beautiful app that I enjoy using every day. The benefits for paying $30+ a year aren’t normally enough to make me go premium, but I would just to support the work of the team building lifesum. The ONLY thing keeping me from upgrading is the weird payment system. It’s monthly but managed by where you upgraded (iTunes or website) and the only way to cancel is to take it up with Apple, or whoever handles the payment. If canceling a subscription with lifesum directly, it looks like you email them and hope they’ll come through on manually cancelling. It’s just not worth the potential headache later. I would rather pay a one-time fee than deal with a weird, fragmented subscription model."
171,171,3,2018-01-05T18:23:13.000Z,Jay Davis 21,Who’s the independent audience?,"I think this app is for females. It’s difficult to determine because the app seems to have a delightful unisex interface. However articles and content posted by lifesum are geared towards females with almost all imagery being that of women and article titles like “Eat Like A Goddess”. Great health isn’t bias, but the sex of an individual will affect it. I assume this is why the customizable features within the app are available. That in conjunction with the unisex interface should be more of a reason to creat an app geared towards everyone to enjoy. If this is more about a marketing strategy I’d assume making that plain would be helpful to users."
172,172,5,2018-01-26T00:45:46.000Z,Zoovirgin,Great App!,Update: developer responded to my initial review and pointed out where the journal on the app was. I guess I haven’t explored the app as throughly as I thought I had.

174,174,2,2018-08-21T01:33:31.000Z,darianf,Okay..,"I wanted to like this app so badly. It’s so beautiful and feels like a native Apple app with the seamlessness of it. However, the functionality is where I feel Lifesum falls short. I was a loyal MyFitnessPal user for years and I decided to try Lifesum Premium to see if I liked it. The small library of food items and the difficulty through which food is logged proved to be too cumbersome for something that I KNOW can be easy, as it is through MyFitnessPal. The “Meal Plans” include eating 500 calories for 1 or 2 days a week... yikes. Every nutritionist will tell you that starving/fasting yourself is terrible for losing weight and your metabolism. The recipes are not worth premium, in my opinion. (Boiled eggs with mayonnaise as an example🤮) I tried Lifesum for about 2 weeks and I will sadly be going back to MyFitnessPal, even though I have 2 months left of Premium on this app."
175,175,3,2019-02-09T05:04:15.000Z,felicidy,What can I do without premium?,"I got this app and immediately recognized the organization which I love as well as the aesthetically pleasing theme. As I was playing around with it for the first time I noticed that many of the features were locked and I need to buy premium in order to use them. Every time I saw something that I wanted to know or a feature I wanted to use, it was locked. Then I realized that without premium there is little the app can do. I think it would be nice to have a month or few week long free trial to test out premium before committing to paying for it, or something like that. Or, the app can just unlock some of the great features that made me download the app in the first place. For example, the camera to take a picture of my meal would save so much time!"
176,176,5,2020-04-12T10:18:15.000Z,Chromega,Well Done Lifesum,"I’m pretty picky about apps, but I’ve got to say, I really like this one! From the moment you start it’s got funny and inviting animations, it’s very organized and professional, and somehow they managed to pack so many different features in without it feeling cramped. It’s very intuitive."

It has potential to be great and I love that it syncs to my watch so I can track my exercise in the same app as my meals. Several things need improvement:
178,178,3,2020-09-24T23:07:53.000Z,ABigBowlOfSalad,"Visually appealing, but meal plans need some work","I think the app looks nice and works pretty well overall. But when you have a section dedicated to meal plans, I hope to be given a guided plan I can follow. Most of the “meal plans” on this app aren’t actually meal plans, they just change recommended macros etc. With a separate tab full of recipes from that plan."
179,179,5,2019-11-05T18:16:21.000Z,vonrinteln,Need personal recipes,*updated from 4 to 5 stars* because the developer feedback was very helpful and resolved my issue!
180,180,5,2018-04-25T00:53:36.000Z,wmalderman,LOST 50 LBS!!!,"I never ever write reviews but this one felt like a must. After I read the reviews and contemplated paying for the $40 yearly subscription, I did. The app and platform itself is simple and aesthetically pleasing, therefore I felt this app would hold me accountable better than I could hold myself accountable. Although I didn’t log food every day and only used a couple recipes, the “update your weight” button kept me motivated to weigh myself everyday and think more consciously about my intake. I also enjoy that my watch activity connects to the platform, adjusting my goal caloric intake based on my plan. After 4 months I am down 50 pounds and I’m not done yet. Thanks Lifesum!"
181,181,1,2019-03-08T17:45:16.000Z,lydiab1997,Not worth the price,"I would say this app has great potential, but it is still in its beginning phases for sure, and therefore shouldn’t be charging $50 annually for the premium. It’s just not worth that. I like the look of it, it’s not too difficult to navigate. But, every time I scan a food item, it is either not in the system and I have to add it, or the nutritional information or measurements are incorrect. (Sometimes the calories are correct but it says the standard serving is 1 cup instead of 1 tbsp, etc). I would say this is the case for 85% of foods that I add to my day and it gets so frustrating having to change everything. I wouldn’t mind having to add a new food or correct something every once in awhile, but I feel like it happens literally every day.  Even items from big companies like Quaker are not in the system sometimes. Pretty disappointing considering how much I paid."
182,182,2,2019-04-06T20:33:40.000Z,nickpen8,Downfall in the Details,I got this app for the advertised meal plans however after paying (since there is NO way to review any recipes or plans before purchase) I was very disappointed. The recipes are VERY vague. Often with ingredients measured in “standard serving” or in grams. The ingredients lists are either odd or so short that I was constantly adding to the recipe to give it flavor. The instructions more or less just say “Cook food and eat it”. There’s no way to add a custom meal on the food tracker so tracking an actual meal you cooked is a huge pain. There are various diet plans to choose from but very little explanation on how to actually live within that plan. Also the meal plan itself is a pain to try and navigate in order to plan and meal prep. In short use this for a free tracker (it really is pretty) but don’t waste your time on the premium meal plans.
183,183,5,2019-08-15T19:25:27.000Z,Jflit,Easy to understand,"I was never a count your calories guy, and I used to be able to eat anything I wanted and never gained weight. Now that I want to workout and get fit, I don’t know what I should be eating and I don’t even know what I’m eatings nutrition is. This app very simply tells you what you’re eating and how much more or less you should be taking in. The only thing is you need to be diligent to put what you’re eating in the app. If you can do that then you’ll be shown how healthy the food you’re taking in is, quite surprised how many items are in their data base. Every item I’ve eaten or made has been in their system and has a detailed nutrition chart for them"
184,184,2,2020-04-06T06:51:58.000Z,heyoooooooooooooooooooooooo,Regret purchasing a subscription,"I had to search the app to find the setting to change the percentage of carbs to protein to fat i should be eating. I accidentally closed the step counter on the home page that has the cool info about how many calories you’ve burned in terms of food, & for the life of me I can’t find the setting to get it back. I also discovered a bunch new settings in my search that I never knew I had. This app could be clearer, & the meal plan options are all the same & there are few options offered based on the questions you answer (like 3). I’ve yet to see this be updated or more plans/options be added. Some foods you can only measure by “serving size” & they don’t indicate how much a serving size is. The fruit & vegetable tracker don’t work, it says i’ve consumed none even though i’ve logged fruit & veggies in meals."
185,185,4,2019-12-20T13:31:43.000Z,NightmaresLair,"Great, but missing a key feature!","I’ve been using this app for just over a week now and the user interface and visual appeal is outstanding!  To me, those are very important pieces to any app. How do you expect me to use it if it’s not easily navigated and looks good!?  The only thing I wish they would add is a way to connect with friends. Unless I’m missing it, I don’t see it. Otherwise this is a great calorie counter app! It connects with so many other apps to truly get a full scope of your health and eating habits. I haven’t ran into a problem with the food database as of now either!  The only addition I would recommend to the food database is being able to create your own recipes. Keep the updates coming!!!"
186,186,3,2021-01-12T21:34:41.000Z,gone rouge,Not all good,"This app has a lot of bells and whistles, it looks great, but it comes with bugs that will make you want to forget using it. In fact I have, but I came back to see if any of the updates fixed them. Items in the food data base aren’t always what shows up on food item labels. It’s not easy to add your own, but try and try again, you’ll get it. And the recipes should let you see the nutritional value of each item, and maybe be able to delete items you aren’t going to use, but then you would find some of the issues with improper nutritional reporting. I’m have labels that claim there are no carbs, but items in the app assign them carbs. WTH. It’s been frustratingly, enough to test your resolve. Probably faster and easier to use pen and paper."
187,187,1,2020-03-29T06:24:28.000Z,lindsaymueller,Not Enough Options,"I saw an ad on pinterest when looking up keto diets and decided to give it a try with the discounted subscription. I was super excited about the variety of meal plans it promised, but was disappointed to find out that the options are limited. I’m a fairly picky eater so I assumed finding recipes I liked would be difficult, but there were a total of 3 things that I would eat and could easily get the ingredients for. Even when searching for a recipe I made, there was nothing that popped up besides the few options on the explore page. If I want to make anything other than the recipes on the app itself I have to manually enter every single ingredient. I had purchased the 6 month plan but deleted it after 2 hours due to the lack of options and the overall inconvenience. Would not recommend going that route because now I spend $30 on nothing."
188,188,4,2019-10-11T14:43:09.000Z,Delisahhh,Liking the app,So I’m at week 3 of using the app. It’s honestly helped me learn much more about Macro Balance and I am a person that was like “huh?” when it came to that. I did buy the premium version because I thought it was worth the investment breaking down the fee per month (please don’t make it more expensive). Health starts with your diet so give it a try and log everything! (Even the bad stuff because you don’t often realize HOW MANY CALORIES OR FAT is in 1 item!)
189,189,3,2019-11-09T16:59:15.000Z,Emrv0816,Beautiful App; Very Limiting for IF Lifestyle,I paid for the premium version.
190,190,4,2018-02-04T18:43:48.000Z,Jennybobennu,Great tool and interface — missing 1 major thing,I really like this app and would love to completely switch from my fitness pal - but haven’t just yet because of one small thing - the ability to scrape a recipe from websites. MyFitnessPal has this functionality and I use it all the time as most of my recipes are coming from Pinterest or other online sources. Saves SO much time and effort  when this is automatically scraped and matched with ingredients/nutrition data. Switching between apps on the phone to manually enter in a recipe is terrible. Please please please consider this!! I love that Lifesum syncs with my Apple Watch health data and not just steps. If lifesum could incorporate a recipe scraper that would be fabulous!!

However, I have to enroll in the ‘Classic Diet’ pretty much like every other food tracking app because it doesn’t let me tweak my own macros. The carbs are locked when choosing any of the keto plans (easy, medium or strict). Bummer! Lots of people on a keto diet know their exact macros due to their weight, height, body fat percentage etc. It’s different for every person. Please let me choose a keto plan and tweak my macros from there! I do love the keto recipes, overall interface and ability to find pretty much any food. Still using it, happy I purchased pro, but please change that! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"

I took a break to use a different tracking app and didn’t like it as much, so came back to the premium subscription for this one. I am an athlete and require a lot of calories for my daily allowance, and the issue I have with this app is that I cannot type in the specific number of calories I need as my base. I like that the macro allowance can be altered, but I’m still needing to journal outside of this app to account for the other 400 cals + macros I need for my daily allowance. If we could have the option to click on the daily calories and type in our goal amount or calories that would be awesome."
196,196,5,2019-10-10T02:34:58.000Z,KupofKrys,Good app,I really like this app. The biggest thing I like about it is that you can use the barcode scanner. This makes it so much quicker to add my food versus constantly looking up food. And I also like that it works with Apple Health app which is my go to daily.
197,197,5,2021-05-17T04:06:49.000Z,xytras714,Excellent app but…,This is an excellent app that has helped me change my life for the better. But…. The Apple Watch complication drives me crazy. It hardly ever loads and when it does it’s because I log out and lock back in and even that is hit and miss. One feature that I would like to see is the ability for the app to read water intake data from apple health (it can already write the data). Good work on this app!!!!

Have to adjust to get the calories right and then it throws the other nutritional info off. This app is more form than function, and I’d recommend finding another meal tracker."

Free app good and a reasonable fee for upgrade which I am enjoying. They should have a free 30 day trial for the upgrade which I’m sure people would want to use. And there is a note section which I love! I use it for ideas, notes on recipes, feelings for the day, etc. I also enjoy the icons! It makes a difference. The faces give immediate feed back. Very well designed! Thank you. One thing to fix, to add your own recipe or add food not found in calorie section, should be able to bring over into recents so you don’t have to keep adding it."

When I downloaded the application, I was immediately amazed by the beautiful interface. Carefully designed and crafted, Lifesum includes everything you need to lose weight. It motivates you to stay and eat healthy when your about to go off track. It also makes sure you eat well. If you don't drink enough water, it sends you a notification of what you have done and the affect is has on your diet. So far I have lost 5lbs with Lifesum in the first week, so I'm very excited for future progress ahead."

I am on the Mediterranean diet now only because it allows me to set my own fat, protein, and carb intake (I am ACTUALLY on a Keto diet) but in the diary it only suggests calories and I have to calculate the fat, protein, and carb myself for my meal preps.  Once I input into the diary the app does the calculation but it would be more useful if it shows it in advance so I can immediately measure out my portions.  Also, the available Keto plans lock the carb count so I can’t put in my individual carb grams and percentages.  Hopefully, the app team will address these two issues in the very near future."

My workouts don’t always show up on the app and when they do, sometimes they get overwritten—-especially if I work out twice in a day.  Second, this app doesn’t track or account for resting calories.

The most annoying issue I ran into was the fact that it doesn’t save your place if you change apps while you add a food/meal/recipe. If I paused while tracking the meal to get more info and went back, the entire meal was gone, and I’d have to start from scratch. I had some issues tracking weight and trying to delete info I added on accident, which isn’t very helpful when tracking. Overall, I liked the look and idea but I wouldn’t recommend paying for this app until many bugs are fixed."

I’ve even lost 5 pounds just by being more motivated to eat healthy and exercise. The big difference for me is it rates the healthiness of foods, not just the calories. The app also nudges you if you eat too little, which I really appreciate! When I have an unhealthy day, Lifesum has good tips on how to improve, and congratulates you when you have a great day! I just wish you could turn on fruit/veggie/etc trackers without having to struggle in the Life Score first. Great app, WORTH the subscription!"
211,211,3,2018-05-29T16:08:03.000Z,SaraHLove654321,Could be better with some additional features,"Interface is user friendly and easy to navigate but I have a few overall issues. The food selections are limited. I find myself having to make things up or selecting an option from a source I’ve never heard of. Thus, throwing accuracy to the wind. Secondly, the diet feature is limited. You can only select from a few diets but you can’t customize your plans or mix them. The options offered are specific and do not cater to dietary restrictions. The helpful hints are catered toward a user who is following the diet perfectly and do not adjust based on actual consumption or input trends. This would be a helpful update as well as the addition of food and ingredients and new and personalized diets"
212,212,5,2018-06-01T13:51:49.000Z,chrstydwn1,Loving This App,"Totally enjoying this app. I was 309lbs and couldn’t loose weight. I only started doing this app at first because I had to go on the low iodine diet for testing. I just wanted to track what I was eating. I started loosing weight on the diet and decided since I was finally loosing weight I would continue using the app.  It shows me how many calories my body needs and if I eat something that’s not acceptable I get a sad face. I’m just three weeks in and weight 277.4 pounds. I’ve done several diets in the past! This isn’t a diet, this for me is a teaching tool of how to live a better in more healthier way. FYI, I am just using the free part of the app. 👍🏻"
213,213,3,2020-08-20T18:07:58.000Z,kylscttsrs,"Love it, but macro tracking could use work","When I put a recipe in, it automatically calculates the number of grams of protein, fat, and my net carbs, as I am on a keto diet. I noticed today after putting a new recipe in that it added almost 5x the amount of net carbs that are actually in the recipe— using Lifesum’s “verified” number of each of the macros, it should have been around 2.8 net carbs."

It is incredibly simple to navigate, and I love the feedback that it provides for each food, meal, and day. With that being said, there is definitely room for improvement."
215,215,5,2021-06-15T02:00:41.000Z,NoStripesTyler,Great App,"Literally exactly what I was looking for. Main menu with everything right up front for you to see. Super easy to use. It knows 99% of things you can. If it doesn’t, you can easily just add the calories (which is all I care about). My one and only gripe about it is the water intake. I wish the water intake configuration was a little more customizable. Even though I’m an American, I prefer to use ml. As of right now you can only go by a 8 oz glass of water or a 16 oz bottle of water. A lot of people use refillable water bottles that typically like 24-64 oz. so no matter what you do, you can’t measure your water to the exact amount."

Also, the interface is clean and and has a nice layout. I do wish there were more ways to enter a portion of food. For instance they’ll have tablespoons, but not teaspoons, so you have to enter a decimal if you want to indicate 1 teaspoon. In general, they don’t offer as many different types of food measurements as other diet apps that I have used."
218,218,3,2021-03-06T02:29:01.000Z,Aubby Aubs,Nice when it functions properly,I’ve been using the premium version of this app for over a year now and like it except one huge problem for me. Sometimes it doesn’t accurately track the food you enter and delete.
219,219,3,2020-07-20T14:27:21.000Z,damb ass,Quite a lot to say here...,"This app would be good for certain people...The way you view the app will determine whether or not this app would work for you. For me personally it didn’t work very well. It’s what triggered  me to an Ed way of eating.  I lost a ton of weight in a very unhealthy way. Leading my body to not function optionally. I started to ditch the app and educate myself on health and nutrition. Going towards a more “listening to my body” type of way. That truly helped me gain my weight back and get out of my ed ways. I’m not saying to not download this app. All I am saying is to please if you feel restricted, unhappy, and making food become a number. Then please do not get the app! If you are happy, feel good, and enjoy using the app. Then by all means get the app!"

There are very limited food plans and not a lot of offered recipes. Also it is very difficult to receive a refund if you are unsatisfied. I tried to cancel about 10 min after i purchases after I realized it did not include what was promised, and was directed to Apple Support who will not refund (Lifesum hides behind the fact that they do not directly handle the payment platform). I have tried to use it anyways since I’m paying for 6 months (whether I like it or not) and now the app keeps crashing randomly when I try to view the plan section. Disappointing, not worth it for premium, might be useful if you stick to free but my fitness pal is just as good with a larger database."

223,223,1,2019-03-28T14:25:01.000Z,Chexty Threekay,Almost unusable constantly broken no connection with watch or other apps,Brand new user. Read all the reviews. Really excited to find an app that helps me keep up with Keto. Unfortunately the App barely works. It’s constantly “losing” my profile goals are changed items aren’t tracked and it’s so frustrating to have spent $30 bucks for a premium plan only to have it think I’m a new user every time I open the app. Even worse it tries to offer me 30% off to go premium AFTER I already did!
224,224,5,2019-10-24T12:32:50.000Z,Ski Solitude,Best weight loss program EVER!,"Love this plan. This app is a MUST if you are on the Keto diet program. Highly recommend the app upgrade. It keeps you on track every meal and gives you hundreds of amazing Recipes. I have lost 19 lbs in less than a month. My max lifetime weight was 243 two months ago, I started the keto diet with this app 25 days ago and I weighed 224 this morning!  It is changing my life. I haven’t felt this good in years. The food is delicious, the recipes easy to prepare and I never get hungry. I also lost my cravings for bread, cookies and snacks. Amazing results for me. Highly recommend if you want to lose weight and stay healthy. Two thumbs Way  Up!!"

Over 2020 i’ve gained 15 pounds!!! But even with my progress it was so hard to keep track of actually how much protien and calories I ate through the day. This is my fav app and I use it like everyday now!!!! It’s free for the basic version which works perfect & it’s so easy to look up the foods you eat or you can just scan the barcode which is my favorite. Literally 10/10, and I NEVER write app reviews because i’m too lazy but this one I knew deserves a good review❤️"
226,226,1,2021-07-20T12:26:37.000Z,ElleLeigh623,Majorly contributed to my ed,*TW ED* I used this app throughout my ed and I can say that it made it 100 times worse. I just got out of a 3 month long stay in inpatient and residential ed treatment at 15 years old and am still in a partial hospitalization program. This app lets you set ridiculously low calorie limits and doesn’t fight you on them with more than a notification that the goal is too low. In addition it sets your original goal at 1200 cal which isn’t even enough to feed a person in a coma. We need at least 1400 per day to exist in a coma and at least 2000 per day to exist a normal life. It encourages people to eat way under the amount their body needs. If you want to lose weight please do NOT use this app. Restricting your calories will not work long term. Listen to your body. It knows what it needs. You don’t want to end up where I and many others are.
227,227,2,2020-08-05T16:46:02.000Z,Ally Rayne,Frustrating,"I like this app for so many things. Scanning in food. Tracking macros. But I’m pretty tired of my exercise not syncing from my Fitbit, or having exercise I’ve manually input just disappear. The app also changes my weight on its own accord. No, I did not lose weight or gain that weight....I clearly haven’t entered the amount it decides for that day. Sometimes it just reverts back to my starting weight for no reason at all. If you’re looking for an accurate graph for weight this is NOT the app you should be using. I’d be better off with a pen and paper. I’ve reported this issue many times, yet it still seems to be broken. Funny....my LoseIt app doesn’t do this....and neither does my FitBit app. It’s frustrating keeping food tracking in one app and weight tracking by in another."
228,228,2,2019-07-10T06:14:07.000Z,Rhae689,"Used to be amazing, just keeps getting buggier","I used to love lifesum, and I still want to! I love that it has multiple plans, all the tips analyzing how you might be feeling or how to adjust your food intake, the way you can Target your calories....They even finally added net carbs! And I really love how beautiful but functional the design is. But after paying for this for a year, almost two, I find it hard to justify the cost. Net carbs is the only feature improvement during this time I've actually used. Fitbit exercise syncing gets worse and worse. The food database has lots of mistakes that I have to account for when tracking calories. I don't need fancy recipes or a bunch of new plans... I just want the core features I use to work but it feels that's not what the developers want to focus on."

I don’t like that the app tells me what my calorie intake should be and doesn’t allow me to adjust it. I like that you can adjust the carbs/fats/protein ratio but ONLY AFTER purchasing a subscription and the ratio HAS to fit within the calories which are not accurate for me! Please allow users to adjust total calories and ratios based on our own goals. The calculation doesn’t even take into account your activity level, just height weight and age - which aren’t totally accurate indicators of how many calories you should be consuming.. I bought a year subscription and want my money back because of that frustration alone.."

For example, I paid to see more nutritional information about what I’m eating, like fiber and potassium, but they offer no other micronutrients like vitamin C, or Iron."
231,231,5,2019-01-01T18:44:01.000Z,manishka5507,Best One Out There,Personally I feel this is the best app I could ask for. It’s so good that I want to be on it 27/7. It’s very simple but shows great new things to try and it has all in one so you don’t have to pair it with other ones. I also feel you don’t need to buy premium but it is a good option if you want to branch out on new ways to record you food. I also like the fact that you can delete old recordings like I started last year but stopped because I got lazy. But now I’m trying it again for the new year and I was glad I could delete the old stuff and yea this app is so great and I’m glad I found it.
232,232,4,2019-04-12T15:37:46.000Z,theflyingcupcake,Much better since the update.,"Lifesum has been much more reliable since the update. It's a beautiful app, and is much more motivating than others I've tried (e.g. MyFitnessPal)."
233,233,4,2019-04-23T22:54:29.000Z,Dane Z. L,Best Interactive experience,"I’ve used a few different calorie tracker apps, and Lifesum provides the best in app experience overall. They don’t have the most extensive library but it is still pretty good. With it being the most user friendly out of all of the apps I’ve tried, I’ll compromise a bit on having a good, not great, library to choose foods from. It should be noted though that we do not eat out hardly ever so I have to do a lot of creations of meals in the app. A great benefit though are the recipes that are already included in the app. I haven’t figured out if I can import a recipe from Pinterest or anywhere else, but that would be a huge win if they could figure that out."
234,234,3,2019-04-24T04:00:27.000Z,Chelsea AZ,Good but needs some improvements,I like the app for tracking macros (and the user interface is fun and motivating) but need a couple major things fixed/added:
235,235,2,2020-07-17T20:15:18.000Z,HayleyHay4,Lost Two Years of Data,"I used this app for two years, and during the first year I used the paid version, but I never cared for the recipes/meal plans and such, so switched to the basic version. It works as well for weight loss as any calorie calculator, you’ll get out of it what you put into it. However, my issue was that with a recent update, I lost the last two years of weigh ins that have shown my progress over nearly 40 pounds. I’ve had multiple issues with this function, such as glitches with updating my weight (I’d put it in, but when I checked the chat it would have spiked to my original weight). I’m just annoyed and done overall. Deleting this app today, unfortunately going to just lose all my past data and I’ll be trying out another app."
236,236,4,2019-07-03T18:01:07.000Z,masupert,"Good diet tracking app, but a lot is locked behind Premium","Overall, this is a nice diet tracking app. I enjoy that the free version is not riddled with ads. The interface is very clean and straight forward. Daily tracking info is clearly displayed."

238,238,4,2021-06-22T16:01:53.000Z,issapeachy,This app is good,I like using lifesum to track what I eat and I’ve been liking it a lot. I also like the idea of tracking calories and nutritional value in the foods I eat. I didn’t give it a full star because I am a user who likes to cook and there’s no option to save my own recipes in the application to track macros. The recipes in the app is great don’t get me wrong. I’m just saying the app would be better if users are able to save their own recipes with all the macros for their recipe and then add it to their daily meals. I think this would make it easier than having users reenter all the ingredients every time they want to track it. Overall a good application.
239,239,4,2020-05-13T17:15:24.000Z,SuziePoo🤎,Really good!,I got this app because I was feeling self conscious and I wanted to get skinnier. This app really helps! If you put in all the effort to track your meals you really become more aware of what your eating and how many calories it is. The reason I only put 4 stars is because they give you a lot of pop ups for their plans you pay for and I was really just looking for something free and easy to help me feel more self confident. This app is totally free unless you chose to pay for one of the special plans which I don’t intend to do. I would say the free version is probably better then the paid plan. So I would definitely recommend using this app! Really helps.
240,240,3,2018-01-25T23:59:26.000Z,Esbee77,Good start but information is a bit simplistic,"This app seems like it would be a great way for those beginning on a health journey to start out. It offers three options (get healthy, lose weight, gain weight), which is a refreshing change from all the apps who think everyone’s priority is to shed pounds. Another positive: it tracks water intake!!"

I started in early June 2018, and my the end of the month, I had made no progress on the scale. I was always under my calorie limit, I ran 1.5 miles everyday and lifted weights, but I wasn’t going anywhere. I had used MyFitnessPal before and had lost 15 pounds, but I wanted to try something new."
242,242,4,2018-12-14T14:28:33.000Z,myMobibleNickname,Great app.,Great app. Opportunities for improvement are the barcode scanner (it doesn’t pick up bar codes as easily as it should) and the food database (not nearly as comprehensive as other apps).
243,243,4,2019-01-15T16:26:18.000Z,Amandamisslynn,Beautiful Design,"I paid for the premium version and am happy with it. I love the design and functionality of the app - because it’s lovely to use, I use it consistently and find myself drawn to it to update my food and exercise. I don’t necessarily trust the macronutrients and calories that accompany a lot of their search results for the foods and drinks so I always double check those, but beyond that the app is great. Would love for them to audit their search results though to weed out the foods that are incorrect. As long as you are paying attention you can still track everything accurately, I just wish I didn’t have to double check anything new I try to add."
244,244,4,2019-01-23T18:57:14.000Z,Maymaymay:),Almost perfect!,"I love this app, it makes eating healthy SO much easier and it’s super cheap to have a premium subscription (if you can afford $3 a month!), the only suggestion I have is that it would be super cool if during your evaluation you could add in certain things like “I need extra calcium” or “I’m allergic to nuts” just simple stuff like that. Having foods tailored just a little more specifically to what the individual needs would make this app absolutely perfect in my opinion. Lots of the foods I choose to eat have higher sodium because I have a sodium deficiency and as silly as it is, it makes me sad when the food rating smiley face looks disappointed in me for eating high sodium lol."
245,245,5,2019-02-01T17:42:36.000Z,Shibby_Dude :D,Fantastic!,"I’m on a muscle bulk diet after dropping weight. I have a general diet planned out, but also enjoy snacking. I use my planned diet as my template, but this app is fantastic in that I can always track and keep notes about what I eat throughout the day. It makes it to where I can just glance rather than question what I’ve eaten. It’s also nice because you can even make your own meals to use (I made a chipotle bowl on my cheat day). I compared nutrition next to the official Chipotle website and it was spot on! Using this with my Apple Watch in order to keep track of my net calories! So no more guilt or questioning. This is what I’ve needed!"
246,246,4,2019-06-01T03:05:10.000Z,taviachs,Great app!!,"I really like this app. I’ve used a couple apps similar in the past, but this one is beautiful and I’m enjoying the premium features. The only things I am hoping are added are the ability to customize the water logging AND being able to log calories with the option to add the nutritional information. I eat a few meals that I have the nutritional information for, but I have to log the calories instead. I feel a feature like this would not only help with the meal rating, but also save users some time as their only other option is to manually log (and maybe even guess) every ingredient. Thanks for all the work!"

248,248,1,2019-08-08T20:18:44.000Z,death is awesome!,Disappointed,"I bought this app because it boasted about having over 200 recipes and its many diet choices. I got the 1 year subscription and hoped it would work for me. So far it hasn’t. I am trying to go keto to lose some weight and I am also vegetarian (not vegan, so not that restrictive) and when I looked for recipes to fit the bill they only had maybe 10 available. Granted I can look up recipes but I was hoping for more ease with this app. They also don’t have a plan ahead feature which means if I want to plan a meal in advance I have to go through and add it to my daily count and try to delete it after. I disappointed to say the least, never have I felt compelled to leave a review but this app is a waste of money. Do NOT buy the subscription, you won’t get a refund if you don’t like the app and then you’ll be out $40."
249,249,2,2021-08-21T22:54:13.000Z,ydacannej,"Inaccurate, and therefore useless","There’s a lot that I like about this app, including the feel of the design and the aesthetics. Unfortunately, the calories gained/burned associated with different foods and activities are so wildly absurd that the app is unusable. No, I did not burn 1000 calories at my water aerobics class. If that were the case, all of the little old ladies there would be going into hypoglycemic shock. No, I did not burn 800 calories walking around the grocery store. No, I did not burn 160 calories from going on the elliptical for 10 minutes. The app also suffers from a mediocre and inaccurate food library, seemingly comprised mostly of user-inputted data. I wanted to like this app because it’s prettier than some others that I’ve used in the past, but it just doesn’t function."
250,250,4,2018-01-15T23:36:14.000Z,cheynicole267,really nice app,"I love this app honestly, it’s set up nice, I had my fitness pal before but ended up forgetting about it and never tracked my food or anything. I’ve had this app for about a month now and have kept up with my tracking the whole time! there’s only one thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars, more types of exercises need to be added. it has the basic kind but I’d like them to be more specific. but otherwise it’s a really fun tracking app, I’ve lost 7 pounds in the month since I’ve had it, I’m sure it could’ve helped me lose more but I’m taking the whole healthy eating thing a little slow so I don’t drive myself crazy😄"
251,251,2,2019-01-20T13:13:10.000Z,Trixy_bixy,Good but needs some work,"I’ve been using this app for awhile now and it’s got some really nice features! Beautiful layout and way of showing progress. However I do have a big problem with the “premium” content that you have to pay for.  Without paying for the premium, this app is just meh. It seems like every time there’s something that could potentially further help you, you have to pay premium for it. You see that they offer specific diet plans and all this great stuff but that’s only if you pay premium for it. If you aren’t willing to pay the price, then this app is basically just a calorie and exercise recorder. That’s my one issue with this app. If more things were available to those not paying, then I would’ve enjoyed this app more."
252,252,5,2019-01-24T04:00:20.000Z,Penguin5000ft,More plans,"Very nice app, but I’d love to see more meal plans that are built for more variety of goals. For example, I have a metabolic rate that’s faster than normal and I struggle to keep weight. This means, when I go over the amount of calories, and the amount of carbs and fats, it’s actually considered good rather than bad; (but going over the amount of protein remains not recommended) It would be nice to see a plan that would have these things in mind. Another feature that would be nice to see in the future is nutritional values like vitamins and such that you can keep track of from the foods you eat."
253,253,5,2019-02-20T09:51:11.000Z,sauceysoup89,Incredibly easy and effective,"I’m a 29 year old female. I started logging with Lifesum on January 8. It’s February 20, just less than two months later, and this morning marked the 19th pound I’ve lost. Seriously - JUST LOGGING. I scheduled my ideal weight (140) and put my current (169) and set it to classic dieting which sounds limiting but is just being aware of your calories. When I reach the calories for the meal, I stop. It’s almost over-simple. I can’t believe I’m losing weight like this, and I haven’t worked out even once so imagine what would happen if I did. Lifesum is my favorite tool for counting calories and weight loss!"
254,254,4,2019-03-10T00:19:27.000Z,emma_nobs,I love it! except for ...,"I wish they had more options for meal plans with allergies. if they did i’d give 5 stars. they do have a recipe section and you can look for nut free things, but I wish they’d update it so that if you have soy allergies and choose vegan for a week, it can help you around that. Or people on keto who are vegetarian, etc. Other than that this app is INCREDIBLE! the accuracy is great unlike some other apps i’ve used in the past. So much so I bought the premium version. Helps me track my water intake, my carb intake, all my food, my exercise and the meal plans (if you don’t need really special diets) are great! It’s definitely worth the money to upgrade to premium."
255,255,3,2019-04-02T12:43:47.000Z,db238,Currently broken,"As others have mentioned, used to be probably the easiest and most pleasing nutrition tracker to use. However a couple of critical bugs have plagued it for a couple of weeks now... I work in dev and I understand that critical bugs especially can take time, however there seems to be some radio silence on the newer, more serious bug introduced by last weekend's patch (which was itself supposed to fix a critical bug)."
256,256,4,2019-05-19T20:55:45.000Z,Huskthis22,Love it!,I love using this app to help me track macros. I really like that you can pick between certain “diets” and it adjusts your daily needs accordingly! It has a water tracker too for those trying to stay more hydrated! There are 2 things I wish they included:
257,257,5,2019-07-23T13:44:34.000Z,Court2500,Great app unlike its kind,"I have only been using this app for about a week, but I don’t imagine anything changing. I paid for the 3 months premium subscription and got a discount for signing up for my first time. I’ve been having A difficult time enjoying certain meals on keto, and this app is perfect at telling me what I need to eat and giving me plans and being able to track them for a day. I would highly recommend this, even if it’s just for a few short months to get you on track for the day that you want. I’m hoping to lose more weight with this in the upcoming weeks"
258,258,2,2020-10-05T17:12:15.000Z,The Bryson City Santa,"Good, but can’t add own recipes","This is geared toward packaged products and restaurants. If you’re geared toward that, this app seems fine. Yet if you cook, there’s no means (certainly not an intuitive one) for putting your own recipes into the app. So if you make, for example, egg roll bowls (essentially the innards of an egg roll, but as a stir fry/salad without the shell), you have no practical means of just entering “4 oz golf egg roll bowl” based on a pre-entered recipe with its nutritional info. That makes the product useless as a food diary unless you totally rely on the lazy forms of food a good diet plan should encourage you to avoid. Disappointing. Will reconsider if you can explain (and make way more visible) a way for entering your own recipes. And if that’s a premium feature, it’s not obvious...it just says access to more of yours."
259,259,1,2019-09-22T22:53:08.000Z,Taurusmark,Terrible app,"This app is so frustrating to even try to use. I can’t believe I purchased the premium version based on other reviews, only to find out that it is so bad. The premium version has very limited functionality, and trying to enter real food is a battle that just isn’t worth fighting. It seems to think that all food comes from restaurants instead of my own kitchen. Too bad if you didn’t have a side of potatoes with that omelette. The app just decided that you did and you’re stuck with a food journal that isn’t representative of the actual food that you actually ate. And just try adjusting your macros to something you would want to track. The app pigeon holes you into one of a few predetermined meal plans and expects you to stick to that.  I am deleting the app even though I paid $30 for it."
260,260,4,2017-09-22T16:59:09.000Z,sassmaster93,"I've loved everything about this app so far, EXCEPT...","I've been using this app for several weeks now and I love it. I use the barcode scanner to enter in tons of foods and I've also linked my Fitbit to keep track of my exercise. The only thing I can't STAND about this app is that there is no setting for net carbs on the meal/eating plans. On a low carb/keto diet, fiber is subtracted from total carbs to give you an idea of the number of grams of carbohydrate that are actually impacting your blood glucose levels (net carbs). Without net carbs, it shows that my daily carb intake is WAY over what it should be when almost half of that is fiber. Please fix this and the app will be perfect!!"
261,261,1,2017-10-08T21:32:32.000Z,NeuroWorm,Disappointing and Subpar,"I really wanted to like this app and even got a trial of the paid version. I liked the idea of the recipes and health scale. Quite frankly, it’s underwhelming and seems like it wants to be more like MyFitnessPal or Fitbit. However, its scanning function hardly works, and a lot of the information it does have is wrong or incomplete. It also does not track vitamins and minerals, which are really important, especially if you’re dieting. You also have limited control over what information you can input for a meal or recipe. I will say that I like the faces next to individual food items, but again, this is only effective if the information attached to the food item is correct. This app has a long way to go before it can be real competition for some of the other diet and nutrition apps out there."
262,262,2,2018-03-02T16:42:18.000Z,Kristingavaza,Crashes constantly,"I decided to try Lifesum after several fitness vloggers did sponsored videos about the app. The only draw of it over my fitness pal is the aesthetics. I used it daily for months and it drove me insane that it constantly crashed. I should mention that I currently have an iPhone 8 so it’s not an issue with an old phone. I don’t mean once and then it would work if you opened it again. There are just periods where it doesn’t work at all and you can open it 20 ones in a row and it will just continue to instantly close. It is insanely frustrating. Once you’ve got some of your favorite foods in the history, it’s annoying to switch to another app. So my advice is not to invest in it at all. Go with my fitness pal. Lifesum is cute but gimmicky."
263,263,2,2018-10-03T04:16:36.000Z,LunchboxNYC,Prettiest Calorie Tracker But Limited,"This is by far the best looking calorie tracker I have used on iOS, but also one of the most limited.  It has the most limited food library of the calorie counters I have used.  But where it really falls down is in its customization.  It doesn’t allow for custom snacks or meal types only 4 meals and doesn’t allow input of time for meals.  Doesn’t allow input of supplements.  Doesn’t allow custom food entries.  It should also be noted there aren’t complications for all Apple Watch faces, if you have a favorite face make sure there is a complication for it.  In short this is an app for someone looking for the most basic of calorie trackers in a pretty package, but if you are serious about tracking anything more then your macros look else where."
264,264,3,2018-10-24T05:07:51.000Z,Maddieyyy,Subscription /premium,"I would love to have this be my primary app for food logging, because it’s very friendly and adorable. However, it seems I need to pay for a subscription to do absolutely anything."
265,265,4,2019-01-05T13:20:14.000Z,ShineOnDiamond,Almost Perfect!,"Lifesum is so easy to use and helps me feel so much control over my health! I love not only being able to track but getting insight into what I could improve about each choice. The ONLY thing I would change is that there needs to be a desktop experience to allow users to more easily enter recipes and meals... this can be so tedious on a phone screen. If not a desktop functionality, the app should at least be able to flip to landscape orientation that way iPad users could use a keyboard for the same purpose! So MyFitnessPal wins in that category. But overall, it’s the best nutrition tracking app I’ve used!"
266,266,5,2021-02-17T14:05:06.000Z,mamamac5,Sublime,"So helpful, so easy.  But, the weight check in."
267,267,4,2019-11-04T15:10:58.000Z,Left0verture,Not bad,"I’m new to Lifesum and just getting acquainted. Generally pretty easy on the eyes and tracking food/water/etc is pretty intuitive. Login with Apple gets a big thumbs up from me. Not sure about the canned eating plans - I’m not into ‘diets’, just want to track overall calories, maybe macro and fat/carb/protein balance so I started the ‘classic’ plan. At the end of the day the app yells at me for not eating enough, even though my body says I’ve had enough. Thought the vegetable tracker would understand that a salad counts as a vegetable and clock it accordingly - guess not. Must be a manual thing. I probably just need to use it for a while longer to get comfortable."
268,268,5,2021-01-11T16:28:31.000Z,Lemoncholy22,Exactly what I needed,"This app is fantastic! I use it all the time and I have no complaints. I have only ever used the free version and it works wonderfully. I used this app and set my goal and, after a few short months and regular exercise, I lost twenty-three pounds. The only problem is that once I got the update, couldn't open the app. Still can't, actually. Other than that, the app is beautiful and very well programmed. I still can't believe how well it worked. I feel great and energized, and I really appreciate clean, healthy food. get the app, you will not regret it by a long shot!"
269,269,3,2021-01-21T15:50:19.000Z,JoWe1317,Works Well But Very Basic Unless You Pay,"I like the way the app works, and it syncs very well with Apple Watch and Apple Health. It’s very visually appealing and fairly easy to use. BUT it can be annoying to track your food by hand since you can only use the camera feature if you pay Premium, and you can’t switch plans unless you pay for Premium. Not that I want everything for free, but as an app that is advertised as free, you are VERY limited on what you can actually get for free. Not being able to change plans really bothers me, because as everyone knows, every individual is different and has different nutritional needs, which LifeSum will only support if you pay for it."
270,270,5,2018-03-05T17:44:05.000Z,GoRachelGirl,Love it!!,"I don’t normally write reviews but I thought this app deserved one! I’ve been trying calorie counting/fitness apps for years and Lifesum does a fantastic job and I can safely say I won’t be trying another app soon. It’s appealing to the eyes, helpful for macro counting and offers meal plans that look and taste delish! I recently just noticed that it rates the food you log and tells you which ones are good for you and which ones are bad. This app has made me enjoy tracking my food, exercise, weight, and water intake. I highly recommend this app!! Can’t wait to try the pro version soon!"
271,271,5,2018-08-01T16:22:07.000Z,Jen.J,Five stars well deserved.,"I have nothing but good thing to say. I didn’t have a lot of weight to lose so this app helped me get back to my goal weight pretty quickly. I was so happy with it, I purchased the full version. I now use the 5:2 plan to maintain."
272,272,3,2019-03-26T13:29:13.000Z,Gingergettinggreener,Wanted to love it,"Love the UI, color scheme, and intiuitivity of the app but there just isn't a big food library available yet and I often find the nutritional information to be very inacurrate so it's back to basic my fitness pal for this girl."
273,273,2,2020-08-29T15:04:00.000Z,Colle201,I was expecting more,"When I downloaded the app, I immediately took the quiz on what diet to follow. After completing this quiz was directed to subscribe, which I did. I thought for what I paid I was getting a meal plan to follow, but instead got recipes that I have to search for and try and figure out my meal plan. And if I find recipes, I don’t have an option to create a shopping list, which would make this even more convenient. Considering one of the questions in the quiz asked why I don’t eat better, with an answer of because of time, this app doesn’t help with that.  It takes me more time to plan everything out and make a shopping list. Waste of money. I wish I had put it elsewhere on an app that actually did what it says it will do."
274,274,4,2020-06-09T05:56:13.000Z,allnamestaken23,Good Diary but....,"I’ve been using it for a couple days and it seems to have a great food diary and is very user friendly but I can’t seem to get my Apple Watch to get to log my water like the devs say is possible. I tried swiping up on the middle screen to log it and couldn’t. So then I tried to use Siri to do it ant it said to check in the app. I made sure to have everything on and correct but it didn’t work. I would like to be able to easily just log my food and water from the watch, it would help out so much seeing as I’m not supposed to have my phone out at work and that’s the main time I’m drinking my water."
275,275,3,2020-02-06T01:53:31.000Z,Nisaxx,Love the interface but would love more customization,"I bought the premium version of this app because I thought it was so cute and I really wanted something that could show my macros at a glance both in grams and percentage of my daily calorie intake. However it’s really annoying that you cannot set your calorie intake yourself AND if you exercise it increases your calorie limit for the day. I’d like to see functionality where I could set my daily calories, and macros, perhaps with a slider and have more control over this than the presets provided by the different “plans” on the app."
276,276,3,2020-01-30T15:17:12.000Z,High Priestess OP,Easy to use but poor weight tracker,The database for food is extensive and the option to scan bar codes is really convenient but it doesn’t work all of the time. Logging food is extremely easy.
277,277,4,2019-09-18T03:09:48.000Z,musicabby,Great app and has helped so much but..,"I’ve been using this app for 2 months so far and have already lost 15 pounds. It has become part of my lifestyle. The only thing that I wish would be improved would be for there to be more exercises for me to look up and log. I have been adding the approximate amount of calories burned for each exercise that I do, but it would help a lot if more exercises were added to the database. A thing that I find odd is that things like “cleaning the house” and “playing drums” are exercises in the database while things like battle rope and vertical pull-ups aren’t. Love the app but this is my only advice."
278,278,5,2021-04-08T01:59:55.000Z,Jenjendoitagain,Easy and Fun!!!,I’ve had SEVERAL “weight loss” apps and this one so far is my favorite— mainly because the free options are better than most and i don’t feel much pressure to download and pay $25 for the premium version. It gives me the option to log my water which is great because I really try to drink a gallon of water per day so it’s easy to log. The meal logging options are easy and he little apple animations are super cute! I gave it 5 stars because you can use almost every feature for free which is not the case for most apps like this. Highly recommend!
279,279,3,2019-08-12T20:18:11.000Z,Vladrath,"Great tracker, ok plans","The meal tracker features are really sharp and the amount of food in their database is really top notch. It’s not hard at all to find the food you’re looking for. Although some entries are not correct it’s pretty easy to recognize that someone had made a mistake creating that food item, and you could usually go find another one easily."
280,280,2,2017-11-08T15:15:51.000Z,girrafey_,Not the best option,"Switched to Lifesum from MyFitnessPal just to try something different. Aesthetics is pretty much all this app has going for it. The emojis that judge your meal choices are cool, but when the food info isn’t correct, they’re not much help. The search database is completely off calorie-wise and most things are misspelled (even cell phones have spell check now..), so if you don’t have a barcode on what you’re eating, you’re screwed. I found myself Googling how many calories were actually in foods - most of the time, MyFitnessPal was the first search result - and adding it manually. When you add manually, you can only input calories, no other nutrition info. Also, with MyFitnessPal, you get recipes/articles without upgrading to premium."
281,281,5,2018-03-24T11:17:37.000Z,sweetiekjo,Love this APP Lifesum,This is by far the best tracking system I’ve found to help support weight loss or to just track food.  I personally use for weight loss.  Love how I can upload pictures of the food I eat per meal.  Love the smile icon/emojis!  Great recipes!  Love the charting information too!
282,282,5,2018-11-29T11:52:43.000Z,toriboggan,Absolutely Amazing,"This is the first time I have EVER written a review on an app, but I just couldn’t help myself this app is amazing! The design is beautiful and it’s so simple and easy to use. Wow that sounded like something a robot would say but for real, it’s so fun and I actually really like tracking my food intake and exercise thanks to this app. I don’t even know how there is a free version because there are so many things on this app! It even has a barcode scanner! Overall I definitely recommend downloading this app whether you trying to lose weight, gain weight, or just be healthier!"
283,283,2,2019-01-09T21:50:09.000Z,thecommamaster,Great App With Caveats,"The app is beautiful and great, but the meal planning and the recipes are very limited. There’s a huge library of recipes, but they all show as “4 Servings” with no way to change it. The meal plans don’t last more than 3 weeks, which definitely isn’t enough time to meet most people’s weight loss goals. The water tracker doesn’t let you customize the size of a bottle or glass, and the notifications don’t work at all (they're enabled in the app settings and the iOS settings). It would be great to pick recipes from the app and turn them into a shopping list, or even the ability to import recipes from the web (via the share buttons in browsers), and have the ingredients auto-import into a meal plan with a shopping list."
284,284,3,2019-06-11T15:59:35.000Z,sjamesmccarthy,"Nice layout, solid data presentation but buggy","I like Lifesum because it is a fresh look on nutritional data that makes it easier to manage how much I eat for each meal. The meal plans are thought and valuable. The photo the food works surprisingly well too. However the app is buggy, crashes a good portion of my uses and sometimes the data gets munged but quickly fixed with a restart of the app. It probably deserves 2 stars, but I am hopeful the quality will improve, features will be added and the food database is cleaned up. I’m not sure I would spend the 40-50$/annual subscription. The $20 I spent on the “pleas come back” offer was a fair price for quality right now."

286,286,2,2020-03-26T18:55:53.000Z,P From PDX,Really poor experience adding nutritional info,"Great UI, lots of very helpful features but users are limited by the extent of Lifesum’s database and the company’s ability to update it. If users can’t use the barcode scanner, they can only enter calories without macros. It defeats the purpose of having any plan that tracks those, and makes the premium account kind of useless UNLESS you’re eating foods that are already in the database. Combing through customer discussion boards, this has been a requested feature since 2016. Clearly this customer concern hasn’t risen to the degree of import necessary to compel a design or architectural change at Lifesum in four years. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark, and I’m not staying to find out what. Keep my money, I’m out."
287,287,1,2019-09-06T18:34:27.000Z,shedontlikey,Annoying and limiting,"Is there not a way to add your own food? If I’ve purchased something made by a keto bakery and have the macros, why can’t I add this food? The only self add I see is the simple calorie add. I was forced to purchase the app in order to use the keto strict plan, and now it’s limiting me in how I can use it. Also, i don’t always have a barcode for my food. Some eggs are naked in a bowl and have no carbs. But when I take a photo, they show up as .9 carbs. This is a big deal when you can only have 20 carbs a day. Another annoying thing: I don’t have time to enter an entire recipe for food or meal and allow the app to determine the macros. I have a good idea based on what I can read for myself. Why can’t I just input it myself when need be? It’s very limiting and frustrating to be this expensive."
288,288,4,2020-09-22T13:47:48.000Z,"!,???????!!!!!!!","Love, but keeps crashing","I am really loving this app because it provides great information on what I’m eating beyond calories. I’ve been struggling with losing my last 10 lbs and although I eat healthy this app makes me pay more attention to the full picture tracking calories, fat, carbs & protein (plus some) for a more balanced meal/day. The only issue I’m having is that it crashes at least 5 times a day. I have also noticed that it takes a bit for my iPad to catch up with what I log on my phone - but that is minor compared to the crashing. Hope this is fixed soon & I’ll come back with 5 stars!"
289,289,2,2020-08-22T17:14:03.000Z,mqp23,Renewed subscription but didn't receive premium features,"I did enjoy using this app when I started out eating healthier, I even bought premium a few months ago. My subscription ended and I didn't feel the need to buy it again but as soon as I linked my card to my Apple ID in order to renew my Apple Music, the Lifesum app decided to renew my subscription & charge me for 3 months of premium as well. I didn't ask for this subscription but when I realized the payment was made and went to check on the app none of the premium features were there and the app was still insisting that I buy it. So essentially I was unintentionally paying for an app that wasn't even offering me the perks. Pretty annoyed and won't be using it anymore."
290,290,1,2018-01-27T05:16:59.000Z,Grace Elizabeth R.,Befriend your hunger?! Absolutely not.,"Took the test to see which meal plan I should follow and my “nutritional advisor”, Lykke, told me “When you befriend your hunger, you can lose weight without actually changing your lifestyle”. My recommended meal plan was to eat what I want 5 days a week, and fast 2 days a week. Are you KIDDING ME?!?!? Please someone else agree with me that this is unhealthy both physically and mentally. I mean really??? A NUTRITIONAL ADVISOR is helping me meal plan by telling me NOT TO EAT FOR TWO DAYS. Outrageous. This type of “meal plan” is what encourages eating disorders. I pray this portion of the app can be removed in order to spare others from the damage it may potentially cause. I understand in limited circumstances the reason for a fast, but encouraging ongoing multi-day fasts is damaging in more ways than one. Thanks, but I will never “befriend my hunger”."
291,291,2,2018-03-26T15:00:44.000Z,Per☀️ Place,Getting further and further from useful,"I’ve had this app for a long long time now, I use it from time to time to re-evaluate where I’m at with how I currently eat. It’s nice to look at and functional, however with each update more and more functions disappear and can only be used if you “go premium,” the latest being adjusting macronutrients. I have recommended this app to so many people but I’ll have to stop if you can’t even adjust your macros to your lifestyle. Looks like they’re getting rid of workout tracking too which is sad. Please bring those 2 things back to all users. I’m not going to commit to a “diet” and track everything I eat for months, let alone a full year which is the cheapest per month."

Tried my fitness pal but found this much more  pleasant to use. One advantage of my fitness pal is that they have more products added by other users. Fx here in Iceland I was able to find allot of local food brands. One drawback with that though is that the nutritional information might not be as accurate. It really came as a surprise to me how easy it is now to track your calorie í take using apps like these. Highly recommend this app!"
293,293,2,2019-03-26T01:12:12.000Z,sprckhx,Calories complete off,"I do love the design of the app and all of the behavioral nudges that it provides. However, it is useless to me if it cannot get my calories right. It gets the workout calories right but the step calories are completely off - first of all, they double count between steps and workouts (when I go for a run, the app adds calories for the workout and then for all of the steps); second, the amount of calories per step is huuuuge. When I compare the active calories with active calories within Apple Health, the Lifesum ones are much higher, despite Lifesum loading the info from Apple Health. I so want to use the app but if this does not get fixed, there is no way I will keep paying for premium subscription."
294,294,5,2019-04-02T14:17:23.000Z,Sayde Jane,Love!,"Still love this app but I do wish one thing. I wish there was a place to save your own recipes and be able to add them to your food journal that day. Example, I make my own Peanut butter and oatmeal balls. I know the cals and everything to these but I can’t find a pb ball that’s close to it when I look it up so I would have to type in ever ingredient separately in my journal. If there was place to do that then save that as a recipe that could then be chosen as a meal, would be amazing. Other than this it’s a great app. And even if you don’t pay the free portion is extremely useful."
295,295,5,2019-05-16T12:30:50.000Z,Elmcfrisky,Weight loss,My husband and I decided to focus on health and lose some weight as well. We started with your app the end of Nov. using the 5:2 plan. We knew we didn’t want a diet or eating plan we wouldn’t stick with. So we picked 5:2 for it’s flexibility.
296,296,5,2020-05-23T19:06:38.000Z,OxeishaxO,Feature recommendation for Recipes,"Love this app so much! It’s helped me so much on my weight loss journey. One feature I wish the app could include is the ability to customize recipes. Sometimes I don’t have all the ingredients for a recipe, or maybe I would rather not eat a certain ingredient like bacon, I would still want to be able to track the accurate food items I’ve eaten in my meal. There should be an option to check off optional ingredients and calculate the updated calories and nutrient intake. I think that would make life so much easier on the app!!"

299,299,4,2021-02-02T05:26:42.000Z,kristyna.rehovicova,Last update made it horrible,"I will give 4 stars, because so far I havent had any problem. BUT the last update is horrid. The search mechanism is busted. You removed the brand name from the search which is pretty important. When someone tries to search something there is no longer the tab “recent” and “favorites”. I lost 2 days from my diary, I have to scroll past all my favorite items to get to my meals. Really I dont know who thought that would be good, but UX is falling behind. It literally adds tons of unnecessary steps to reach the same goal as before. I would call it downgrade and not an upgrade."

Shopping list gets a little screwy and will add items not even on your list, units of measure on the list takes a little getting used too but well worth it.   Would love to see the ability of generating the list for two instead of an individual.  Also am I doing something wrong?? Doing the 3 week meal plan and when I check off the food it’s not adding it to my calorie counter.  Premium membership worth it, meals and quick and easy... I love this app so far minus the glitches I seem to be having"
301,301,1,2018-01-30T02:06:47.000Z,alisure,Not sure what I paid for,Upgraded to premium with the promise of meal planning and specialized diets. What the cost actually unlocked was a few specialized diets that largely were all comprised of the exact same meals. In addition the meal planning feature had a small handful of meals available with no real flexibility. For example - you can’t even block a day out. I downloaded today with the intention of shopping and starting at the end of the work week and yet I was required to have a meal selected and added to the shopping list for days I didn’t need. I also couldn’t rotate in other meal options - even ones found within the app.

And when I followed the app’s link to unsubscribe, the developer only gives you the options to renew various packages. No way to unsubscribe or cancel!!! They also automatically auto renew at the end of user package you subscribe. So if you sign up for a month or a year, at the end of that period you will be automatically renewed and charged again. I tried to cancel through Apple but as this is a 3rd party developer, Apple doesn’t have the ability to do anything. And when I went to the Lifesum website and emailed customer support, I received an automated email about 3 days later informing me to follow the unsubscribe link through the app!!!! So basically the developer has locked you into a subscription with no way of canceling."
303,303,5,2019-10-11T04:23:54.000Z,Dezitrish,Perfect,I love this app. I have lost 25# following the 5:2 plan. It’s easy to make recipes follow a plan and track my macros I love that it links with apple health and my work app. It’s perfect there hasn’t been anything I’ve wanted to do that I can’t with this app. I also tell everyone I know about it only thing I hate is I can not change the calories in my meal plan so I just have to remember to subtract like a 100 calories a day. I just wish that feature actually worked. It’s there but when I change it it just changes right back. Other than that perfect
304,304,4,2020-05-20T19:37:22.000Z,Fer.Oropeza,Amazing app!,"I'm impressed! This app is so good! I started taking care of my nutrition a couple years ago, and this app that I found a month ago has been a really helpful tool when tracking my meals and calories. I strongly recommend it! Reason I give it 4 stars is that it doesn't have monthly plans. I know many apps manage yearly subscriptions but that's something I don't like. I prefer to pay a month and if I like it I keep it. This one has a 3-month but the price ends up being too high and close to a yearly payment. It's good even for its free features, but if it had a month by month I would pay for it."
305,305,3,2020-01-11T18:11:11.000Z,MorganJEchols,"Great, but difficult to figure out","I have honestly have never had this much issue figuring out an app before. The premise is great, the calorie counter/home page is super useful, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to use the plans and the calorie count at the same time. Maybe I’m just missing a major step, but tracking food from the plan doesn’t automatically add it to the calorie counter so I’m spending way too much time importing nutritional info-which is exactly why I paid for the premium, thinking I could just use their meal plans.... no such luck. If I knew I was going to have to do this much research into how to use it, I never would have paid for it."
306,306,2,2019-12-07T14:42:54.000Z,Regan Lizabeth,Change the way you charge people!!,"I enjoyed this app for years. It’s easy to use and personalize. I like it a lot more then fitness pal. However!, I used to be able to use so many of the features. Now if you even want to set your own Macros its premium. If you still want to make money, charge for the app and make the subscription only for the plans. That way if someone isn’t interested in the plans they still pay and if someone is they pay a subscription. This has been frustrating me so much because I don’t want to pay monthly for the regular tracking options. I can’t even change my macros for god sake. You may as well get My Fitness Pro at this point, a lot of the things locked here are free there."
307,307,5,2019-09-30T13:42:17.000Z,MrTgwiz,Indispensable… If you're serious,"Incredible application! This app has become an indispensable part of my daily life. Once I decide to get serious about my health, Fitness and eating habits, I started looking for hey simple to use comprehensive means of tracking and I found it in Lifesum. With little effort, The application provides detailed information, feedback, Coaching, Insights into daily eating habits. Oh hell, it provides everything important to nutrition to help anybody achieve their nutrition and health goals. I would highly recommend this app to anyone serious or just curious about what they eat"
308,308,2,2019-08-18T14:33:38.000Z,Inetwebguy2001,Needs better nutritional data,I’ve been using this app for about 2 months now and have a couple issues.

310,310,5,2018-02-16T20:51:24.000Z,Tefflawn,So Engaging and Easy to Use,"This app is nicely made. I’ve used many nutrition tracking apps, and this one is most engaging by far. There’s great little touches like the grocery store beep when you scan an item, cute icons and characters. I love that it syncs with my health data to auto update my calorie allowance after exercise. I do wish there was more flexibility in setting days for 5:2 diets, since schedules can change from week to week. It would also be helpful to have an easy recipe builder for counting calories in home meals. But overall, I’m very happy with it!"
311,311,1,2018-11-05T14:22:56.000Z,Wayerbot,SO DISAPPOINTED!,"I paid premium for 1 year and regret it. So much of the information is inaccurate. The measurement and the nutritional data IS NOT ACCURATE. Even using the barcode scanner provides incorrect information. Very frustrating. I end up calculating everything myself and then trying to find a correct entry that is close which is a waste of time. Because of these issues I stopped using the app for the last few months and decided to try again, hoping it might have been corrected and updated. But it has not been fixed. I really do not understand how this app has high ratings. If you check the accuracy of the information you will see how “off” it is. Very Disappointed. Do not waste your money on this app. Verify for yourself using the free version. 🙁"
312,312,4,2019-03-12T20:52:27.000Z,Rpairan,If only it linked to my Apple Watch,"I love this app and the customer service team is great. The ONLY two downsides are that it doesn’t really sync to my Apple Watch and it clears the search after you add an item to your diary. On my watch it doesn’t show the correct macro breakdowns for the plan I’ve chosen, adds in exercise calories even though they are not added in my diary, and the complication doesn’t update on my watch face. When I search for a restaurant and want to select multiple items I can’t and have to search after each selection. Kinda time consuming and frustrating."
313,313,5,2020-05-19T16:18:13.000Z,MMC_Megan,Poor Customer Service,"I had bought the premium of this app (was not offered a trial) so I could track my specific macros, given to me by a nutritionist. Once purchased, the app was nothing like I expected (I could not input my macros as they are over the “100%” limit) - therefore I wanted to cancel. I have tried multiple times to reach customer service to see if they could help me in anyway, and I have yet to hear back."
314,314,4,2020-04-21T19:47:05.000Z,Izcta,Good app but some bugs,"I’ve been using this app for about 2 weeks. I really like how everything on the app is set up, and I’ve been able to keep myself in check more than I would have if I were tracking my calories, water intake, and exercise on my own. However, today I’ve been trying to input my lunch and it is not registering no matter what I do. I closed the app, restarted my phone, and tried inputting only my calories and not by food type, and still it simply will not allow me to put in my calories. I like this app but if I can’t continue to put in my data, what’s the point?"
315,315,2,2019-12-31T16:25:53.000Z,anna8779,Bad Meal plans,"So first off, I love the recipes-they are delicious! And most of them are super easy. The app itself has been a little frustrating to figure out. I don’t think you can create your own recipes. I’m doing the keto burn plan and likes the idea of not having to think about the food or plan it out. However, I’m only allowed 20 carbs a day and I just ate the breakfast on the plan without looking at the nutritional info, and it was 16.5 carbs. Looking at the rest of the day, my carbs are WAY over the limit, which will put me out of ketosis. So I’m either going to have to go hungry or get knocked out. The whole point of paying for this was so I didn’t have to figure out my amounts. I ASSUMED that the recipes they used would be within my range."
316,316,4,2021-05-24T12:42:04.000Z,tsun amy,Great Minus The Glitches,"Overall, this app is great. I enjoy the interface & recipe suggestions. However, there are a few glitches I’ve experienced. Sometimes the app will close when I’m trying to open it. Another glitch is when the food I’ve tracked disappears but then it comes back after a while. My last complaint is that I’m very underweight, so underweight that the app won’t let me enter my weight. It keeps saying “Are you sure that’s what you meant? Try a different number.” This was discouraging to me as I am trying to gain weight and this makes me feel more upset about my current weight."
317,317,4,2020-09-14T16:47:41.000Z,NatyAjila,Good but it could be better.,"Overall I like the app, very easy to navigate and get used to it. It has a variety of colors that makes it very attractive for the user and a large selection of products. It's an eye attractive and user-friendly app."
318,318,3,2020-07-13T21:13:56.000Z,Wanelo is marvellous! :),Recipes should be modifiable,"I am enjoying this app and the meal plans, but the recipes and meal plans could be way better. I am currently doing the keto plan and a lot of the meals have salmon, or random ingredients like halloumi or bresaola. I tried to find those last two in multiple grocery stores, but haven’t been able to. These ingredients and some others are also too expensive to eat very often. I’d prefer if I could easily swap the ingredients (like there were substitutes I could edit the recipes with rather than having to enter an entire meal into the tracker just because I changed one ingredient), or the recipes used more accessible and affordable ingredients."
319,319,1,2020-02-04T20:24:48.000Z,kikoskates,"Visual beautiful, but bad choice in recipes",I was excited about ease of use. Once I was using it I found the following issues:
320,320,5,2017-09-15T21:34:05.000Z,Kaira.,Love it!,"I love the smiley face or frown face icon beside each food item I scan in, and the one beside my meal overall...it helps me to know which food items to choose again and which ones to avoid in the future. Plus, the app creates a graph of my weight gain or loss to show me visually how much progress I've made over time. Love that! Helped me get past a plateau. I've never bothered to rate an app before, but I love this one enough to actually take the time to share my opinion... five stars... totally recommend! I hope you get it and use it, because it works!"
321,321,2,2018-01-15T18:18:18.000Z,Slvrhrn,Has Potential (Free Version is Very Limited),"Clean look, fairly intuitive to use. Unpaid option, however, is pretty limited. I like the thought of having recipes tailed to my diet but this is a paid feature, as is connecting your other fitness apps, like Fitbit, and personalized recommendations. So the free version is basically a food/calorie tracker."
322,322,3,2018-07-10T02:36:25.000Z,Smashley912,Too many synch issues,"I really really want to like this app. I love the interface, how it gives the different diet plan options and breaks it down in an easy way to show if you are following ( the smiley faces really have made it simple!) What I don’t like is that every few days the app does not read my activity from my watch or lately load the information into my Health app. I’ve had to uninstall and reinstall the app to have it function every couple of days. For something that I am paying a $35 subscription for, the support team has yet to rectify these issues. It really devalues an app the has the potential to really make weight loss easy."
323,323,4,2019-02-06T11:54:34.000Z,KelsKeating9**,If you can’t upgrade...,"I like tracking with this app better than fitness pal but I may have to switch back because I cannot customize my plan to fit me. I have goal macros but unless you pay to upgrade you can not set the number of calories you eat or your macros. I understand that the app needs to make money to improve but the ability to customize a plan for individual needs should not be something that doesn’t come standard. Also, I love that you can enter in a recipe and save it for the future but lately that feature has not been working properly."
324,324,2,2019-05-01T05:11:41.000Z,Nadeent,Keeps crashing when accessing plans,"I just started using the app and purchased the premium version, I was able to open “plans” and picked my plan, the app suddenly crashed and it keeps crashing since every time I click on “plans”, I tried restarting my phone and reinstalling the app but it still crashes. I am able to track food but noticed that some of the caloric data is drastically inaccurate."
325,325,5,2019-08-14T16:05:45.000Z,EngineerEagan,Fitness minded,"I do not purchase apps often but during my fitness goals I hit a plateau, so I found this app and decided to give it a try. This is one of the best applications I have ever used! The cost is very affordable, the app is very well designed and easy to use as well. I’d like to be able to create recipes and divide it into food portions plus save them like “RecipeIQ “ but for the most part I love the app, that’s a suggestion not complaint. I love the fact I can choose what type of diet I want to be on,  Intermittent fasting is what works for me. (5:2) how about you?"

327,327,3,2020-08-06T12:52:48.000Z,MsWiaS,Helpful but recipes not always “diet approved”,"I do like this app and find it helpful when following a specific diet plan. However I’ve noticed that a lot of the recipes you can look through outside of the ones designated for your plan don’t actually follow the plan you chose. For example, the keto plan. It suggests you stay under 20 net carbs per day, which is fine! But then you go look at the “keto recipes” and they have recipes that are 15 net carbs in one serving alone. It would also be helpful if you had a basic recipe nutrition calculator to put in your own recipes to make sure you stay on track. Otherwise an intuitive and easily used app"
328,328,3,2020-03-28T11:15:20.000Z,Le_Binha,Lacks functionality if not choosing a plan,"This is a pretty app, I give you that. I think if they added more features it would be great. But, for instance, even after purchasing Premium, I would not be able to plan my meals or use the shopping list premium unless I chose a Plan. Furthermore, you cannot copy or edit items you create. Those two things were very frustrating and I thought there were not going to be a problem. If you are looking to follow a plan or just track your food, it is a very good app. But if you want more functionality, specially when not following a Plan, do browse for other options."
329,329,1,2020-07-10T18:41:32.000Z,Mr. Fromage,Not as streamlined as it could,This app fails to eliminate redundant taps on the main path to calorie tracking.

They’ve done a great job with simplifying the process of tracking your meals and workouts. The general workflow is quick, easy, and the emojis featured with each meal keep me engaged in providing updates and improving my overall health. When I eat well, I get a super smiley emoji to reflect that, and the positive reinforcement keeps me motivated. Contrarily, when I don’t eat well, a sad or angry-faced emoji appears, prompting me to do better."
331,331,5,2018-05-29T15:57:34.000Z,nanhoff,It definitely helps,It’s just a new simple and effective tool for weight loss or maintenance. The app is easy to use and it encourages you to stay within your calorie limit and gives a good breakdown of the nutritional value of the foods you’re eating. I also like the ability to enter almost any exercise you’re doing and have those calories added to your daily allowance. The water reminders are also a definite aid for me. I’m never drinking as much as I should. I still don’t- but I don’t go a day anymore without several glasses of water.
332,332,1,2019-01-02T22:54:18.000Z,SamboMaine,Meal Plans are a Bust,"I subscribed to Premium to access the meal plans. I’m on day 3 and am very frustrated with the recipes...the Carrot Soup with Garlic Creme Fraiche omits most of the instructions and I had to search through the Recipes tab to find something similar (but not exact). The measurements are in an odd combination of deciliter, cups, grams, and the occasional teaspoon or tablespoon, all in one recipe. The Turkey Spinach Omelette and Quinoa with Eggplant and Spinach are terrible recipes...they do not include anything in the way of spice or flavoring and are inedible as-is. Tracking plan meals is buggy - sometimes they do not show up in your calorie count and sometimes they do. The recipe for the Crispbread with Apple, Cream Cheese, and Walnuts tracks as 2298 calories and there is no way to fix the calorie count. I’m extremely disappointed...I do NOT recommend this app."
333,333,3,2019-03-12T12:07:13.000Z,Jolie Gosier,Not really useful?,"The app is really good to keep you on track for the day. Without premium you can get an accurate measure of how many calories you should be eating and how many you do eat. It also keeps track of the amount of water you drink. The problem is if you can afford premium the app really doesn't do much for you. You cant get help with dieting, personalized insights, recipes, or any suggestions on what you should be eating. Without premium the most you get is a smiley or sad face that shows that you didn’t eat enough calories. I feel the free option should include mote features rather that almost being a journal of food."

However, it doesn't track properly due to not counting sugar alcohols. Also, I'm unable to import recipes or create my own recipes. Therefore, I have to guess how much of which ingredient I'm having in each serving. I also wish there was a desktop version as well for when I'm at work."

337,337,2,2020-07-24T13:33:46.000Z,recklessrelentless,Disappointed in the meal planning features,"I purchased the premium version of this app for the weekly meal planning feature / grocery list. You don’t have the ability to 1. Create your own recipes 2. Create a grocery list. With this app you HAVE to pick from a very limited number of diets in order for it to generate a meal plan (I only had the option of 2 diets) and you can’t add anything in addition to what the app gives you. It seems kind of like a waste unless you only want to eat exactly what it gives you in there. The only thing I will say is that the layout / look of the app is nice & great if you want to track daily ingredients that you eat, but any features beyond that are lacking."
338,338,2,2019-12-13T03:40:16.000Z,Varuna Srinivasan,Not for me!,"This is not a bad review but just my opinion. Like everyone who downloads the app (or any app) - you are asked to pay more to see more. I thought it was worth it and it was 15$. Instantly regretting my decision, I asked for a refund and was denied. The thing is I already paid for it and I tried using the special features but there’s nothing there that’s really accessible! All of the recipes call for expensive and unattainable (only available at whole foods) ingredients. I didn’t think it was helpful in suggesting where I needed to go and what I needed to do. The only reason I haven’t deleted this app is because I paid 15$ for it but I seriously never ever use it. Not for me but hope it works out for you!"

I contacted customer service and they told me the error was on my end and I hadn’t purchased a membership. I have a receipt from apple showing I paid and they still wouldn’t do anything I needed to purchase another membership. I told them I reached out to apple for a refund and they said they hoped apple would resolve the problem and that was it. Horrible customer service, wouldn’t admit there was a problem with the app and offered no guidance to resolve the problem but to spend more money without receiving the product. Hope they improve the app and their customer service."

Recipe ideas, beautiful and seamless UX, great customer service when I emailed them to resolve an inquiry regarding activity tracking, and what’s best is that it’s lightweight and FUN. I even subscribed to premium because I loved the added functionality and insights but found that it’s super useful even before upgrading to premium. Would certainly recommend giving it a go!"
341,341,5,2018-05-31T23:10:30.000Z,rxsix,Good but needs fixing,"I really love the app and would give it five stars if creating your own recipe wasn’t so uncomfortable to find, and forget about editing the recipe once it’s in you can’t fix it or change it- at least I can’t, I go in and change what I did differently on a particular day and when I hit done it doesn’t go through and neither does the X so I have to close and relaunch the app. Also i wish the app gave me the flexibility of viewing my own recipes and foods without having to set it up like I’m about to add a meal."

Paying for an app that’s missing this basic functionality is criminal (hyperbolic I know). I’ve been using Lifesum for ages and this issue has been present from day one after Apple released the health app."

The scan feature is so helpful - most restaurants come up - and I live & die by the daily ratings! The days I do super good with my macros are the days I have my losses, if I have a rough day (which thats ok!), I know to prepare for a stall or minor gain, but always get back on & keep following the plan! The app is also extremely user friendly - which is a huge bonus!"

A couple hours after I purchased, I decided to cancel for my own reasons. I requested for a refund after cancelling my subscription and it told me flat out I couldn’t get a refund. I could understand if I used it for a month or weeks why I can’t have a refund but not a couple hours after I purchase the plan. Ridiculous!"

Food will randomly show up on a different day that i didn’t log it on, a day’s data will be missing from the daily progress section, and just yesterday all of my step counts for the week disappeared messing up my calorie intake. I also believe it is a bit generous with how many calories my steps are burning. MFP says 70 while Lifesum says 400 — something must be off. I also wish there was some way to set a calorie goal without selecting a meal plan."
350,350,4,2018-01-04T05:54:25.000Z,Pink26,Almost perfect,I really love this app. Maybe more that Fitness pal bc it lets me take a test where I can pinpoint what diet would be better for me. I am on the Keto strict diet and from the research and endless videos I’ve seen I should be counting net carbs not total carbs. Unfortunately this app counts total carb and not net carbs so that really limits me on my eating. I would love it if it keep track of my net carbs instead of total. Since that is what we should be counting when on Keto diet. Also there are a lot of recipes not found when I search and it would be nice to be able to add a recipe if i have all nutritional information.

I like being able to scan and track my meals, track my water intake, get inspired for my own recipes using theirs and track my weight loss. I’m down 1.3 lbs in 3 days and I attribute that to keeping a closer eye on my portions and macros using this app. The only things I don’t like about this app are my inability to create and save my recipes, as well as, the somewhat inaccurate count of my macros. Otherwise, I’ll keep using it because I’m seeing results already!"

I eat almost all whole foods but have been cutting down on carbs to improve. I bought the premium membership to learn about macros. Almost every meal I log is classified as imbalanced including my breakfast today of kale, avocado, tomatoes, and eggs with coffee/table cream and coconut sugar. All meals are shown as too high in something but there is no way to click in and see where you went “wrong” so there is no learning. The algorithms seem overly restrictive and are not designed to educate. The added sugar algorithm also does not show you where the too much sugar is coming into your diet."

I’m a college student and I was really excited to get my calories checked and check my macros but this app is so inaccurate and does even put down the foods serving size or calories.... also the calories restrictions are so limited and don’t really cater to your weight and how fast you want to lose weight when you are doing the specific meal plans such as the weight loss, keto or Mediterranean. It’s only been 2 days using this app and I really want my 20$ back..... I was really looking for more. I hope I can contact this team and get my mom back bc I will not be using this for 1 week let alone 3 months"

I wish there was a way to see your own added recipes and recipes native to the app in separate sections and not all together under “favorites/recipes.” Moreover, it’d be great if the app could incorporate intermittent fasting on a daily level as well as weekly (i.e. not only selecting days in a week when you’ll eat fewer calories, as presently, but also which hours in a day you are eating every day). Thank you!"

But since you’re kind of forced to pick a diet it does the calculations for what the app thinks they should be, except I have a nutritionist and he wants me at different percentages/grams. I can not for the life of my figure out how to do this, so as of now I’m thinking that it is not a feature. It’s pretty disappointing, I really need to be able to customize my macros to what I want them to be at. I guess I’m gonna have to keep looking at apps, it’s a real"

I’ve noticed some annoying glitches with the tracking though. For instance, it seems to switch back and forth between adding back exercise calories and not. This isn’t a huge deal but it’s pretty annoying when you are 400 calories under your limit then suddenly 50 over without having eaten anything new. Ideally there would be an easy way to switch this on and off as a user. For the free version at least there isn’t."

I’ve been using Lifesum for 90 days now and have 1 major complaint that keeps my rating a 3 vs 5.  Lifesum allows you to save food ‘favorites’ like Fitbit, BUT Lifesum does allow you to sort you favorites, and in fact the order in which they are listed when you access them seems different every time.  To Developers:  Please fix this to add sort option, or at least have favorites display alphabetically every time you access them.  It’s very annoying to have to search through random ordered favorites every time with the current app."

Discussing weight and guilty pleasure foods can be hard to do - shame ridden with face to face admissions about weight, blowing the diet, photos, measurements....I’m cringing; most of us just lie to avoid of that shame.  When I keep myself accountable of Lifesum, I can record the truth, things I’d rather not share, and feel ok with my choices without stigma and opinions."

You can’t have a program for gaining if you force people to account for all of their meals in 4 slots a day. This structure prohibits success when you have to compound all your food into not enough slots. (This has been one of the most requested features for YEARS - check the forums)
360,360,5,2018-03-09T21:01:00.000Z,MadRienell,Great features and easy to use,"My daughter uses this app and loves it so I thought Id see what all the fuss was about. Ive been using this for 2 weeks and I am really impressed. My fav part is scanning bar codes and having the info instantly pop up. Saves me time and hassle.  You can adjust everything, whether you want it to track 3 or 4 veggies or fruits; it is all adjustable. You can even set how many calories you need to eat. It is so versatile!  I have had so much fun with this. Ive lost 10 lbs (some water weight) so far.  Thanks!"

I like lifesum much more as it has a nicer user interface and minimal clutter. It is pleasing to the organized eye. The reason is when I went to start food tracking again, I wasn't able to change my macro percentages unless I switched to premium. I used to be able to change this no problem with the free one, and was so shocked I decided to switch immediately. Changing macro levels should be no different than changing your calories. Fix it lifesum! I would much rather use your app, but I will not be paying for it."

I LOVE the barcode scan to make tracking food way faster. The carb/protein/fat tracker is also a nice bonus. My only complaint is that it seems to be operating for someone who has a traditional 9-5 life. So when I get up at 10:30 AM it’s telling me that it’s almost time for lunch, it gives me a bad score when I haven’t eaten enough by 7, and stops notifying me and updating by like 9 PM. Rather annoying for a night owl like me, but it’s an easy thing to ignore. Overall I’m very pleased!"

The only thing I wish was different would be the ability to enter foods specifically to what you ate, (i.e. I made a breakfast sandwich this morning that was a plain bagel, provolone, chicken and egg, but they didn’t have anything similar to choose from for my breakfast so I had to choose a chick-fil-a sandwich instead) rather than making you choose from pre-made selections, it would allow your calorie intake to be more accurate and help with your program (whichever you choose to do)."

However the app is glitchy and some of the functionality really annoying.  This morning I logged my breakfast with a picture.  It only correctly identified the red pepper (it was eggs with veggies, banana, peanut butter and English muffin).  So after adding the rest, it didn’t actually save the picture.  I originally was excited thinking you could take a photo, log the details later, but that doesn’t work.  <<highly recommend you add this for people who can’t log at meal time.  I am going to move on and hope to give this app a shot another day."

Lately it’s not keeping my profile info and I have to constantly update it on a daily basis which makes this is a pain to have to go thru. Can you fix it please. I’ve never paid for an app and this is the first and I was living it till the last week or so having this issue makes me not want to renew... fix it and I’ll bump it up a star, but if the problem persists I’ll have to take away stars"

I’m very happy with this app because it helps me control my weight. For your meals and snacks you can type in what you had and it will tell you about that food! I also really like that test you can take to tell you if you’re healthy or not. If you aren’t as healthy, it will help you! I suggest getting this app because of how helpful it is. I’m definitely happy."

I only wish the shopping list was a little more user friendly. I’d prefer that when you add items to the list it doesn’t organize them in any way. It would save time in the grocery store.

I have gained the weight back and tried using this app to maintain my weight. Normally females should have around 1,600-2,000 calories. The app was recommending for me to have only 457 calories a day! And as I continue using the app it recommends I only eat 328 calories!!! Calories are energy and that’s what your body needs. To eat less than 1,000 a day is not healthy. For the app to even recommend that is not ok. While it is good to eat healthy like fruits and vegetables, carbs and protein should be included. The app recommended me to only eat 41 grams of carbs a day. The app is promoting orthorexia and should be reevaluated."

I want to switch over from MyFitnessPal to Lifesum, I really do! But MyFitnessPals ability to scan bar codes to input food, to manually put in the calories and nutritional information of a food and to save my own collections of meals is really what’s keeping me from using Lifesum. Also the database of food, restaurant menus on MyFitnessPal is way WAY bigger, accurate and better than Lifesum. And MyFitnessPal provides all these better things for free no less!"
371,371,4,2018-07-09T18:59:37.000Z,Deerezz,Like it but it would be better if it had more plans available,"I was using this app to track my macronutrients while I was on the keto diet, but now I switched out to paleo. I really love the details it shows you from what you eat, my only issue with this is that I wish there was a paleo plan but I can also see a difficulty in that existing since paleo doesn’t track calories nor does paleo track macros. I guess it would just be an open nutrition count. It would be cool if they added some hints or guiding info on how to work on the paleo diet for others to follow as beginners."

I haven’t used the camera successfully yet, but I have found comparable foods in the app.  I like that the app incorporates information from my Apple Watch; less info for me to enter.  Having actual metrics available at any time is enlightening.  It’s easy to think I’m doing well with my diet, but Lifesum provides me with real data.  It also gives little tidbits and supportive comments throughout the day for encouragement and education.  Glad I got it."

No problem, just a few bucks a month. Issue is now that I’ve paid for the premium membership the app keeps telling me I need to upgrade, but when I go to upgrade it tells me I already have. I have tried signing out and signing back in and even deleting the app and then re downloading. Neither of these seemed to help. I have also reached out to the developer and not received any response. Seems like it would be a nice one stop app to monitor calorie intake and physical activity, if it would just work."
374,374,2,2020-07-15T13:20:30.000Z,Dex_long,Inaccurate Food Data,"I was not a big fan of this app due to the lack of accuracy of Lifesum certified foods in calories, macros, and/or serving size. About half of the foods I looked for in the first two days were not accurate in serving size or calorie amount. I quit after that because that’s the one thing that a calorie tracker needs to be - accurate; otherwise, what’s the point?"
375,375,2,2019-09-22T22:10:26.000Z,randomnicknamegenerated,Inaccurate nutrition facts,"Even when you scan the barcode the nutritional information does not match, making it cumbersome to accurately track your macros. Pay close attention... you scan a package of sliced pepperoni (for example) the package gives the nutritional facts, per serving. A serving of pepperoni in this instance is 4 slices. The application however extrapolates that that is the nutritional information per slice. It has done this with every single thing I have scanned. The data is the same for what is already cached in the application. Which is why I have been scanning my food, because it’s wrong. The application itself looks great. Developers just to step it up a bit on the accuracy."
376,376,5,2019-07-08T01:09:02.000Z,kateg2,Makes being healthy a habit,I love this food tracker! Unlike other trackers it wants you to create healthy habits that will last long after you’ve lost or gained the weight you want. Other food tracking apps are ugly and too complicated while Lifesum is a gorgeous app that simplifies healthy eating. The only thing I don’t like about the app is the frowny faces it gives when you eat “bad” foods. The app should promote balance in healthy eating and not make users feel guilty for enjoying a square of chocolate when they want to.
377,377,1,2021-02-05T17:11:58.000Z,jurg0023,Not worth premium,"I bought the premium version and it’s not worth it. I’ll log an exercise and it’ll be gone the next time I go in. I’ll log my weight and then it’ll be different next time. This happens on all sorts of areas, even my birthdate has changed on me, and I continually need to check back on things and correct. And it’s a little weird. It measures water intake by 8.45 ounces, and it’s hard to enter the exact the nutrition facts, like it’ll recalculate my calories to be 59 rather than 60. Also, I can’t set my own nutrition goals or macros, I have to use one of their five preset plans. It’s just odd. Also, huge annoyance is that it doesn’t sync steps with Fitbit, only workouts! So I have to manually enter steps into Apple health. Just so frustrating."
378,378,4,2020-12-23T19:43:30.000Z,Skoobie Du,Nice app but needs some improvements.,"I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max and parts of the UI are getting cut off in the corners. Also, the keyboard gets in the way when trying to enter a value for potassium in a custom food. I would also like to be able to edit the name of scanned foods because the names are either incorrect or excessively long; e.g., scanned name: “Breakfast nutriflakes cereal 40% bran flakes”, actual/shorter name: “NutriFlakes Cereal”. Being able to edit the brand would also be nice, just in case. Another feature I would like are more micronutrients to track, not just potassium."

When it comes to tracking, data is super important and being able to add as much as possible is very helpful. When you go to the doctors and they ask you to track your food intake they almost always tell you to just write down the stream of consciousness rather than just static calories and stuff."

I thought there would be more plans with the paid version, but turns out there are maybe 10 tops and I wouldn’t call them “plans” per se, more like “general themes without much personalization”.  I like the Lifesum UI but when I’m without a barcode and have to use the search bar to enter food, I end up with lots of odd, misspelled options with ENTIRELY different calorie counts!  One of the first options that came up for olive oil said there were 58 calories in a TB, roughly half the actual amount.  Despite prepaying for 6 months I think I might have to go back to MyFitnessPal just for reliability."

I wish I could get more specific about the types of meal plan I’m following or want to follow. But mostly I wish it would also allow tracking of physical and mental wellness as well. Like it’s great to be able to track on a given day that my mood and/or energy felt high, and also I did or didn’t have a stomach ache. All of these things are so important when looking at trends and big picture for our health & wellness. I’ll keep looking for an app that can incorporate this as well, and hopefully one day Lifesum will be that app."

The clean eating intrigued me, but I’m disappointed to find there is no meal plan for it, just recipes. I also find it disappointing that recipes are usually imbalanced or off track, even though they are suggested from the app. I’d like to see balanced, on track recipes, so that I can have an idea of how to eat better."

They make you pay for the whole subscription (in my case I did one year) up front. This wouldn’t be a problem except my account STILL doesn’t show that I have the premium subscription even though I paid for it. It’s been three days and I’ve sent emails and followed instructions from their “customer service” page. Also the premium Lifesum subscription isn’t eligible for a refund from the App Store. Don’t buy premium unless you feel like throwing $40 away without receiving what you paid for or hearing back from the company support. Very disappointing because I was so excited to unlock all the extra features.
384,384,5,2021-04-30T02:50:17.000Z,TilerMost,What I have been looking for,This app is awesome! I wanted something similar to the Fitbit app not that I have an Apple Watch and my steps and workouts dont transfer correctly. Tried a few apps out and this one takes the cake. Even better than the Fitbit app and less expensive. This app collects steps and workouts from apple watch without issues and what i really like is how it breaks down the different nutrients you are or not eating. It has been really helping me change bad habits I didn’t know I had.

I’ve used a lot of apps and tracking systems since I started being cognizant in 2008. It makes me want to be better with my diet and exercise and explains exactly what is going on with my health and fitness in terms I can understand. It has SO many options for diets and explains the benefits of each and why each macro breakdown is suggested. Can’t recommend it enough. I’m obsessed!!!

I’m constantly trying to find ways to eat as healthy as possible and it gives so many reminders and options for recipes to live a healthier lifestyle.

Diet tracking is okay, lots of missing barcode data so not as good as other mainstream diet trackers. A few bugs in the app around food entry, specifically doesn’t refresh and even if you put in food it doesn’t seem to process entries. I suspect this is an issue with the latest update. Although the lack of refresh in the diary has been a recurrent problem. Overall, I enjoy the product however I’m neutral on the premium product, it’s okay but their are other more viable alternatives."

We should at least get the important information... The good things about it is that it’s fun to use when you want put what you are and it really is a good diary! Then if you are too little calories, then it will say you need to eat only a little bit more and it will also say if you are too much! I got this app from a YouTuber! Anyway, that’s what I think about this app! Ok but also horrible at the same time! 🥳🥺😡"

The developers responded to everyone complaining about the issues by fixing the problem and I’m really glad I can use the app again, the problem was solved pretty quickly and efficiently and I applaud them for that, many apps don’t care to fix problems quickly. It’s a great app, and I’ve tried just about every food/nutrient tracker out there, this is by far my favorite."

So this was deleted immediately.  So I get a response back but all they want to do is justify the cost.

The best part is that I can scan in my food items with the barcode scanner. I tried out the free app for a couple weeks and wasn’t bombarded by ads which I was very surprised about. This made me upgrade to the premium app because the makers “got it”. You can get more users when you don’t overwhelm users with ads . Thanks!!!"

I actually prefer this app over MyFitnessPal personally. I like that you can just add in calories if the app does not have your food items stored though I wish we could manually enter macros in ourselves also. Sometimes I have a recipe with calories, carbs, protein and fat written out but I am limited to only entering my calorie number in the app. It would be nice to be able to put in the macros myself to keep an accurate count!!"
402,402,5,2018-08-15T21:00:36.000Z,Afaye2005,All the features!,"Everything I didn’t know I was missing in those other food tracking apps. Love that it correlates with a diet plan and adjusts for your individual needs. Love that it connects with my Fitbit so I don’t have to enter as much data. Love the tips and reminders to help me know I’m doing alright and keep me on track with the plan. Love that I can save groups of foods as a meal and reuse it again next time I eat the same meal without hunting down each individual ingredient again. Button line, love."
403,403,5,2019-04-02T11:25:02.000Z,PaulCassso,A Great way to be healthy,This app makes recording your meals and tracking your calories so much easier than any other app that I’ve ever used. Plus all of the feedback that you get when you’re recording your meals helps you to know what’s better for you and worse for you all without forcing you to be on a meal plan. Premium is definitely worth it if you’re trying to get your health on track plus they give you a discount for like 30% on your first year subscription.
404,404,4,2019-05-02T00:38:25.000Z,Templar Fire,Great foundation for a better life,"Without paying, there is already a great number of resources to help track my calories and know what foods I’m eating are good for my desired diet. Visually interesting enough to provide a sense of accomplishment when being healthier and already feeling the results in the first week. Would love for the option to see why certain foods are unhealthy for my diet to be a “free” addition to the app, but understandably an app needs paying customers to keep running without huge advertisements plastered over it."
405,405,5,2019-05-13T19:03:36.000Z,TavviKay,I lost 32 lbs in 10 weeks!!,"I love love LOVE this app!!!!! I wish I could’ve given it a bonus star! In just 10 weeks, I went from 249lbs to 217lbs, my waist went from a 47 to a 44, and my BMI went from 44.1 to 38.4! I did this with just the free version. This app kept me accountable and is beautifully designed. Watching my charts change and been so motivating! I coupled this app with the Fitness22 Workout app to achieve my results and I couldn’t be more grateful! Thank you so much for such a fantastic app! I recommend this to everyone!!"
406,406,4,2020-08-20T13:35:42.000Z,Sdrisss,"Great app, wish it persisted data better","I really love this app, the ease of use, design, thoughtfulness of features. I wish it persisted data a little better. Every few days it will reset my weight back to my starting weight and log that instead of my input, which has gotten annoying. It also loses connection to the Fitbit every other day and I have to go connect it all back up again. I’m sadly searching for a new app even though I love this one the most. I hope they fix those issues because otherwise it’s perfect!"
407,407,2,2019-11-07T15:58:12.000Z,PooterPotamus,"Beautiful, Buggy Mess","I've been using this app for over a year now. This is the only food tracking app that I've stuck with solely because of the UI. But the user experience is made awful by the clunkiness of its execution. Surprisingly often I'm unable to scroll past my lunch entry when I attempt to input dinner. Or looking at past days I'm unable to scroll. Syncing is also hit or miss. Overall, using this app is sort of tragic since it's so close to a seamless experience but they haven't yet taken the extra step to make it as reliable as it could be. I'm hoping they can update this app to be as seamless as other cloud-reliant services."
408,408,2,2019-06-20T19:08:14.000Z,Whooperss,Can’t customize a “plan” for vegetarian or Vegan,"Unfortunately even though this app is lovely and easy to use, it’s hard to customize vegan meal plans with limited choices. You are forced it’s choices for dieting but when you click vegan there are about 3-4 choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner qhich gets boring fast. Additionally adjusting your cal goal is also nearly impossible, while it’s under settings, it doesn’t actually adjust no matter how many times you save so it’s hard to track how on target you are. Lastly you can’t change your macros by day so you are stuck to whatever macros you enter as the target regardless if you likely have variations by day. 😞"

I like all the features and how easy it is to use , I also like how you can add water and have veggie / fruit / sea food goals as well for the day / week !! The only thing I don't like about this app is that the water tracking feature only allows you to track two different amounts , this makes it very hard to add in water when your water bottle / cups aren't that amount . it would be great and would really help the apps likeability if the delevopers could make it so you can add your own custom amounts to their liking !"

There’s not a coach on line to give you ideas on what to do, where to cut back exercise. For the price I was expecting more. I like that I can keep track of food and with the faces I know I’m on track or not, but then I could do that with other apps for free. I’m a visual person I would like to see videos of the recipes given on the app. I really hate the measurements in grams there should be a way to change them to cups, teaspoon, etc."
412,412,4,2018-03-02T13:11:15.000Z,Claireabug,Wonderful  BUT...,"This app really helps me be aware of the things I eat and serving sizes . The only problem I have is that I will click a day and log my meal then I will go back later to log my snack and my progress is gone . I looked at the day before and my information had moved days . Thinking it was user error , I would double check to make sure that I’m logging my progress on the correct date only to have the data move again . I’ve had several sequential days shifts dates and this has happened on several occasions ."

414,414,3,2018-07-02T14:36:05.000Z,mem857,Confusing units,"I like this app a lot. The design and features are helpful for successful and consistent tracking. However, the units listed for many foods when trying to add to the food diary are often confusing or just wrong. You might see something listed as “one serving” or listed as 190 calories when you know it to be 100 calories. I believe it is possible to edit these, but I do not always know the number of calories in my foods or I’m in a hurry. This is not a great app if you’re often on the go, because you may have to double check the number of calories using other sources."
415,415,4,2018-07-17T01:56:10.000Z,Alewall,Will there be new plans?,"So far I’m really enjoying the app, so much in fact that I have become a subscribed user. I enjoy the way it recommends meals and allows you some options. So far my only question is whether or not there will be anymore plans added in the near future. Personally I’m looking 16/8 hr fasting option. The last option that would really advance my experience would be if there was an option to enter your personal MACROS to try and follow. Are either of these options available in the near future? Thank you."

I like the ability to track my calories, however with this app there are some problems. Most of the things you want to track are premium."
417,417,4,2019-01-21T01:22:16.000Z,Ameliay,Please change this !!!,"I’m only give four stars because everything is perfect in the app EXCEPT for the fact that you’re not allowed to change your carb intake! I don’t know why they would lock that SINGLE feature. It says pay for premium to be able to edit your macros but when you do you can only change your proteins and fat. I’m so annoyed with this because it’s saying I need to intake way too many carbs for my ketogenic diet. Please PLEASE unlock this feature ASAP, this feature alone might make me cancel my newly paid subscription."
418,418,5,2020-10-01T15:22:01.000Z,3wishes16,I’m Amazed by this App,"This app is amazing. It is so easy to use. If I want to record the cereal I ate for breakfast, all I have to do is scan the barcode and it pulls the item right up. It pulls all my activity/calories burned from my Apple Watch. Literally it does not get any easier, and this is all free! I love that they made a widget, I put it on my Home Screen next to my activity widget and I can quickly see where I’m at for the day. The app is also very well formatted and nicely designed. 12/10, I love this app so much"
419,419,5,2020-03-09T16:39:59.000Z,Wd1i,Lifesum seems to be working.,I started using this app 3 days ago. I already lost 11 lbs. I know. My wife said it’s water. The meal plans are great. I don’t feel hungry all day.  The food is delicious. The step by step cooking is wonderful. (JUST ONE MAJOR COMPLAINT.)>>>>>I have to fit all the ingredients in a measuring cup. That is extra work.  Instead of or in addition to using cups to measure the raw ingredient it would be nice to see the measurements in grams. Ingredients are weighted fast and accurately.
420,420,4,2018-01-08T16:46:58.000Z,Ventuax,I LOVE THIS APP.... but there’s only one thing,This app is amazing. The layout is user
421,421,1,2018-02-03T18:34:24.000Z,aime135,I want a refund!!! Too rigid to use if you actually cook,I want a refund because this app is very rigid.   The list of foods has odd “standard” measurements (who measures eggs in ounces!?) so you have to do a lot of scrolling to find a normal item.
422,422,4,2018-02-03T23:19:17.000Z,AlyyyP23,Almost perfect,"So far my experience with the app has been great in leading me to weight loss, but I do have a few things I would like to see improved. It would be wonderful if there was a net carbs feature for ketogenic diets. I have been under eating carbs because I assumed the app took the fiber out of the carb count but as it turns out it doesn’t. Also, I have scanned certain foods like an avocado, and my avocados get a bad rating but other avocados are okay. Is this because some foods do have their fiber subtracted out of their carbs? Either way... confusing."
423,423,5,2018-03-22T23:27:04.000Z,elysasms,Glad net carbs have been added! Still a few kinks,"So glad to see they’ve added Net Carbs as an option to help those of us on a keto diet. I noticed the “Nutrient Distribution” still reflects the Total Carbs not net carbs though, so it shows as “Imbalanced” nutrient distribution, and that your food is high in carbs even if it’s low in carbs, which is confusing...This also means some of the meals i eat inaccurately show a frowny face when they’re actually very balanced. Hopefully the developers fix this...adding net carbs is definitely a good start!"
424,424,3,2018-04-04T19:26:53.000Z,Jannehughes,"Overall nice app, hard for US users","Overall I really like this app. The interface is really nice and colorful and easy to use and the option to follow different diets (paid subscription feature) is great. My only criticism is that it’s hard for me in the US to gauge what I’m eating because almost everything is measured using the metric system. I wish there was a capability to toggle between different measurement units. I also noticed that some of the calorie information that comes up when scanning the barcode doesn’t always match up. These are small things, but occasionally annoying."
425,425,5,2018-07-19T14:55:37.000Z,KidArchitect,Love this app! Needs a little improvement,Firstly I’d like to comment on the aesthetic of this application it’s calming and smoothly runs on my iPhone however adding food seems a little hard because adding specific portions that aren’t based on serving size requires decimal conversions that off the top of my head I don’t know making logging the food a much more tedious task than using the app lose it however i still prefer this over the other so i will continue using Lifesum.

That’s what drew me in, but it is the glitchiest thing on earth. I’m a customer who recently upgraded to premium in order to fully access all the features of the app. I recently noticed that this app always disconnects from my smart watch, reboots the calories, and provides macros of 0 carbs, 6% protein, and 0 fats. Wouldn’t you be in awe when you are trying to log your calories, open the app and all of a sudden only be allowed to consume 6 calories?  I’m not on a water fast..."

Lifesum has a beautiful UI, wonderful, flavorful, quick, healthy recipes! Meal Plans that seem really achievable - thank you for the cheat day!! - and positive reminders that make me want to stay committed. Excited to see how it evolves and grows!"
428,428,4,2019-08-13T02:09:13.000Z,oliviap1346,Awesome but one tiny glitch,"I have been using Lifesum off and on for years and have been very satisfied with it. However, there is one tiny thing that I’ve always had a little problem with. Whenever I look at a weekly view of calories, all the counts are off. Scrolling through each day individually everything is correct, but when I pull the tab down to see the measurements all lined up for the last few days, nothing matches. I would really appreciate if this could be fixed!"

I feel in control everyday without feeling too restricted. I’ve used many tracking apps in the past but Lifesum surpassed every expectation I had for this. Premium is worth every penny, user friendly, no bugs, the meal rating makes meal planning so easy and fun, I don’t drag doing it anymore. Takes all the guessing out and makes it EASY! So happy with it! Keep up the good work!"

431,431,3,2018-02-19T18:26:16.000Z,CaughtNtheRain,One Big Weakness,When it comes to weight loss the app won’t let you work your weight loss goal around anything shorter than 15 weeks.  For me that’s 1.1 lbs a week.  Basically that’s me not eating chips every few days and maybe subbing a salad for lunch twice a week.

435,435,4,2019-06-01T02:11:06.000Z,EW349,Wonderful but needs more allergy-safe plans,"Great app! It’s visually appealing and offers great tracking features such as water, fruit, and vegetable trackers. It’s helpful tips keep me motivated and on track. The recipes are helpful but I wish they had more allergy friendly meal plans. As someone with a ton of food allergies (most of which aren’t listed where you can mark your allergies) it would be nice to see some more healthy non soy, peanut, tree nut, etc free foods. Overall it’s been a big help to keep my health in track but it would be nice for some more diverse plans"
436,436,5,2021-03-23T22:07:36.000Z,yeetis squid,Amazing app🤩,This app is amazing and is helping me reach my fitness goals and I just really like it a lot. I used to be a lot more overweight than I am now and it is because this app helped me to lose weight and also helped me get on a better diet so I really do think that every one who wants to loose weight should try this app. Also another cool thing is that if you get premium there is so many different recipes on so many yummy things to make and so I think you should try it

It keeps me focused and aware of what I’m consuming and putting in my body. It helps me maintain a healthy weight and diet, which is incredibly important to me. I have a background in nutritional science and this app is not only reliable but easy to use for someone with a high understanding of food and nutrition, as well as someone who just started focusing on healthier living!"

Love that I get to eat whatever I want but in smaller portions and not snack as often as I use to, I also love the info it gave on workouts. Now, it keeps freezing up on me and doesn’t show all the necessary things like working out and having a hard time clicking on how much water I’ve drank to give an accurate reading. I’m almost there and I don’t want to give up this app because it freezes up."

I’ve been paying for premium for probably 6 months and have never had any issues with it. My phone automatically updated Lifesum yesterday and now the app keeps crashing, it won’t let me update meals I’ve created, and it won’t let me delete meals. Some meals I’ve created are showing no ingredients at all, and some won’t let me add additional ingredients. If this isn’t fixed, I have no reason to keep using the app, let alone pay for premium. I hope this is resolved soon."

I feel like I have energy though the day and am able to keep up with my diet without feeling like I’m dead during the day. Excellent start. The only thing that is a down fall (which is my personal preference) the snack section is what I eat pre workout to avoid low blood sugar. But doesn’t show up until I have put my dinner section in. Other than that I’m happy with everything.

However, after I found this app I realized I was eating too many carbs. I have never gone into ketosis and after only three days on this diet I went into ketosis and had lost 10 pounds!!  I’m not sure I can ever do without this app again!  I had tried some others but this one has so many options on premium and is definitely worth the money😀"
443,443,5,2020-06-05T17:31:44.000Z,IAmEmber,First Time User,"Hi Lifesum, I was referred to you from Nike Training Club! I love all the colorful images/illustrations and how seamless your app is (from my 1st day experiencing it). Is it possible to make a meal plan for “carb cycling”? As a personal trainer, I’ve come into contact with a lot of body competitors and experienced coaches who stay carb cycling but I don’t think I understand it well enough to apply it to my own eating. Or is it perhaps already part of some of your plans and just not highlighted in the descriptions of the plans?"
444,444,1,2021-01-26T19:42:48.000Z,Gabriellapooch,Please change it back,"I used to be able to look up items by searching restaurant, brand name when I didn’t have a barcode to scan- and now everything is so general, how do I know I’m logging the correct thing if I don’t have the specific labels or brands. Example: I had an egg white grill sandwich from chic fil a this morning. I know this sandwich is 290 calories listed from the restaurant. I went to log it and multiple egg white grill food variations popped up all with very different calorie amounts and none that identified as chic fil or for 290 Cals. So I opted for the egg white grill that said 240 and I guess I’ll adjust the serving to 1.21 to make it the equivalent of 290. I hope it’s the correct macros because idk if it’s even the right food"
445,445,3,2021-01-08T16:53:29.000Z,Susie Q 501,Just okay,"I should have read reviews ahead of time; I agree with all that say the meal plans are not helpful. While there’s a couple of good ideas, there’s only 4 to choose from for each meal; hardly worth paying for a premium membership. Also, I use the suggested meal and the nutritional tracker STILL tells me I’m off track, whether it be too high in carbs or protein. So, again, another user noted you can never please that tracker and I feel like that can be ultimately sabotage a users mental health. I don’t know how this app got rated best overall in the article I read, I definitely won’t be renewing:-("

I was hoping this would actually work but no, I just wanted to try a few of the things it suggested, but you just want money you greedy pigs. You have the IQ of chewed gum, and you look like a sewer rat that is slowly dying because it couldn’t find food and no one ever cared about it enough even to give it just a scrap of food. Everyone hates you. Edit: I can’t even pick a meal plan because you just want money."

I also love how you can make your own recipes so you can’t track exactly what you made a lot more accurate then if you were to just choose the closest thing to it. Only complaint right now is the snack section is bugged right now where once I log something it says I’m 1,000 calories left or I’m 1 Calorie over but that’s not a big deal imo, just weird"
449,449,2,2019-10-07T19:00:40.000Z,thevanvannnnn,"Tracker is great, meal plan feature needs WORK.","The app itself is beautiful and easy to save meals you eat often. They have an easy water tracker, and they track your progress for you over long periods of time. I didn’t pay for the subscription, but so far they don’t push too hard for it with pop-up or any of those annoying things like most other apps will do."
450,450,2,2018-05-13T12:53:47.000Z,heidiburnstoast,Not that helpful,"While the app looks great and has a wide variety of recipes, it is essentially just another tracker app. I think the claim that it can help you plan meals is pretty misleading. It is true that you can collect recipes into favorites, but (unless Im using the app wrong) there is no way to create meals for the week and to generate shopping lists from there. You have to go into each recipe to find out what ingredients to use. I can find the same recipes by searching keto sites and I can track my fitness through my fitness watch. I signed up for three months but unless it suddenly becomes a helpful meal planner I wont be renewing. Considering asking for a refund."

I have noticed that a lot of the nutrition facts on the scanned barcodes or search option for foods are inaccurate, so you really have to pay attention to what you are entering. Otherwise your macros will be way off, and it kind of takes the simplicity out of having an app to log your food/calories. Other than that it is a great app!!"

I’ve also ended up putting on weight because my job is so sedentary and there’s always snacks. I love being able to search for recipes, having pre planned meals that I can switch up and the pre made grocery list is possibly my favorite thing. It’s not too expensive and I think for someone like me who hates meal planning, it’s quite possibly the best thing."

Now all they need to do is not just add restaurantwith full menus, the menus should have OPTIONS to remove items from from the food and we will be all good. If I go to Fatburger and get a Skinny Burger Large, I should be able to say what I had on my burger or be able to build it to how I ordered it. That is the only thing that Myfitnesspal has over this app imo. They may not have it as specific as what I wrote, but at least they have a single chicken leg option when I order chicken. Increase your food database. PLEASE!!!"
454,454,4,2019-01-13T19:53:20.000Z,Jordanjordan10,"Beautiful app, almost as functional as Lose It","I’ve been a Lose It user for years, and I’ve never found an app that came close to its excellent logging functionality. I’m happy to report that LifeSum is close. There are still some issues with accuracy, but in general it has most foods that I want to track, and the barcode scanner works like a charm. I’d appreciate a clearer representation of the serving size...I still find this app to be confusing in that regard, but overall is beautiful and good enough to replace my previous go-to app."
455,455,5,2019-01-16T19:09:33.000Z,odecker28,Lifechanging,"So I will start out by saying, I did not mean to get the premium account for this app. BUT I am so grateful that I did (everything happens for a reason)!! This app is SO easy to use! They have recipes that are actually AMAZING! and easy to make (not with a million weird ingredients that you’ve never heard of lol) and it has this “smart camera” which you take a photo of your meal and it figures out the amount of calories, cholesterols, sugars, and so on!! GREAT FOR EATING OUT!! And I have lost 3 pounds and this is the first week!"
456,456,1,2019-04-06T00:30:42.000Z,SFScotty,Like but...,I like this app a lot. It’s easy to use and is well organized but: the nutritional information is wildly inaccurate.
457,457,3,2019-05-30T16:34:55.000Z,sarahkellyphoto,"Nice app design, but frustrating calculations",I paid for the premium membership so that I could enable the Ketogenic plan. When you enable that plan and try to use Net Carbs (super important for Keto) the app calculates it incorrectly. Unfortunately that’s not something you can see until after you enable the paid version.
458,458,5,2019-09-29T19:09:58.000Z,ketokarma87,Pretty good app!,I really do love this app and the premium is actually very inexpensive for the options you get I’ve tried many different apps for the keto diet and this one is one of the better ones it has helped me reach my goals for sure! The only thing I don’t like about the app is that you cannot add in your own recipes as you can on other apps. Other than that this one is probably the closest to five stars that you’re going to get when it comes to diet apps!
459,459,4,2020-11-22T20:16:43.000Z,lizabethescoto,i like it for the most part :),i have downloaded many different calorie tracking apps. i have been trying to lose weight & tracking really helps put what i eat into perspective. did you know 5 ritz crackers  are like 100 calories? that’s crazy for how tiny they are — and i would eat like the whole sleeve!!!
460,460,3,2017-12-30T05:50:22.000Z,Puppy Love xo,Nice app but...,"I gave 3 stars because of the obvious amount of work that went into developing this app. It looks like a great app. Two things. More than half of the recipes I was able to view have a startling high percentage of fat—45-56%. It’s just my opinion but there shouldn’t be any recipe, let alone many recipes, on a health app or site that is that high in fat. Any kind of fat. Second is sugar, fiber, sodium and saturated fat are locked in the free version, items that are free in other food trackers. I’m all about paying developers. They deserve it. But I was surprised to see that. Otherwise I like the motivational portions and health tests."
461,461,2,2018-03-08T17:33:44.000Z,Katie2017,"Nice UI, but lack of food options to input. More time-consuming than it needs to be.","Really nice user interface, I love the option to track water, vegetables and fruit. I also really like all the smiley faces to let me know how healthy or not my meal was. However, My Fitness Pal has a much better list of food options to choose from, probably because it has been around for so much longer. It would be a better app if the developers could pre-load more nutritious information from brands and restaurants without relying on users to have to input it. Really takes away from he ease of using the app and makes me want to go back to MFP."
462,462,4,2018-04-02T11:57:11.000Z,Haleykinsey,Better than MFP but...,"I only did a quick look around the app and really loved the design and usability of it! I love the taking a picture of your food function and having the app act as a food coach in a way. Compared to my fitness pal I already knew I would use this app more and I would actually enjoy it too... but, I wish in your diet plans there was a whole food plant base or a vegan option. I know the app seems to cater to the keto diet but would be nice to have an option and would have definitely gotten me more on board."
463,463,1,2019-01-05T15:52:21.000Z,Cheddarmuff,"Pay before seeing any functionality, I think not!!","Seriously, there are hundreds of apps out there and I am not looking for recipes or details but I would like to see if there is a Whole30 or an Atkins or whatever type of recipe assortment BEFORE I sign up for a plan and give you a credit card.  I have no problem paying for a subscription but I would like to see what I am paying for before I buy.  I don’t buy a TV, car, music subscription without understanding what I am getting.  With all the other apps out there, web sites and the like I am not throwing away money just to confirm it was a waste or not."

465,465,5,2021-05-20T18:08:37.000Z,19shiba05,Awesome!,I’m very impressed with this app! I home cook all of our food and with other apps I’ve typing in what I’ve eaten and most of the time it didn’t have what I was looking for. This one has found everything just about every time. The down side is that a good share of the neat things on it are locked unless you buy premium...and it has a lot of adds that try to get you to buy premium too. But you still can do a lot without buying that.
466,466,4,2019-11-02T08:56:01.000Z,dgor82,My only complaints,3 bugs:
467,467,3,2020-06-11T02:05:30.000Z,jspear,Not that great,Some things don’t quite seem to be adding up percentages don’t match with what the numbers are saying like some how my % of protein for the day is 37% and carbs are 35% yet I’m eating way more carbs than protein gram for gram. Some how in the meal summary it’s showing that I’m under my goals by more than my daily goal over all such as saying under 50g of protein this meal and adding up all the “under goal” numbers and it’s way more than my daily goal over all. Numbers don’t add up which doesn’t create a accurate count of macros in turn making it more difficult to reach your goals.
468,468,3,2020-05-26T11:09:07.000Z,polarbear0508,Could be really good,I’ve been using Lifesum on and off for about a year. I love the interface but hate the Fitbit syncing. Mostly because it doesn’t sync. I sync my Fitbit daily and even after trying to manually sync in lifesum it won’t update my workouts until 2-3 days later. Highly frustrating.
469,469,1,2019-08-08T15:17:02.000Z,TiredofErrorMessages,Beautiful Interface Awful Frustrating Inaccuracy,"I downloaded this and another food tracking app.  Both offer free and premium subscriptions.  I was drawn to using Lifesum because the user interface is both attractive/fun and logging seemed easy and intuitive.  Unfortunately, that’s as much as Lifesum has going for it.  Even when scanning my food via barcode the calories, serving sizes, and other specific nutrition info is BLATANTLY WRONG.  I logged the same food on the other app the same way by scanning barcodes and everything came in correct.  I definitely won’t be getting a premium subscription with Lifesum when it’s free service can’t even log food accurately.  Don’t waste your time or money."
470,470,1,2017-10-29T21:04:27.000Z,curtailed2,Total waste of money,"I paid for premium in order to get access to the so called “diet plans.” What a waste of money. There are no actual meal plans associated with the selected diet plan, just a very brief explanation of what you should and shouldn’t eat. However, you can browse through the limited list of recipes that they have to build your own meal plans. That is tedious though because not all of the recommended recipes are appropriate for your selected diet plan. There is also a feature where you can select diet preferences and allergies. That doesn’t seem to inform any of the recommendations either as most of my recommended meals contained dairy of which I’m allergic to. This app was a total waste of time and money."
471,471,5,2018-04-22T03:32:56.000Z,mrscampy08,Encouraging!,I have tried a couple different calorie counting apps but one thing that stands out about this one and not the others is their approach. This app encourages you to get healthy. If you make a good choice it tell you “good job”. If you make a not so good choice it says “that’s ok. There’s always tomorrow “. Most apps in this genre don’t do this and in fact what you do is usually not enough. Trying to change eating habits is anything but fun and it’s nice to have that extra pat on the back.
472,472,4,2018-12-21T04:46:34.000Z,NicoleFriend,Net Carbs Doesn’t Work...,"I love this app and have used it for almost two years, but I hate that there isn’t a way to contact the team except through a review. I’ve been try to calculate my macros for my vegan & ketogenic lifestyle with LifeSum Premium, but have had an extremely difficult time. The app will tell you your net carbs, but only uses total carbs in all of its calculations. This, it tells me I’m way ahead in carbs and that I’m consuming 15-20% of my diet in carbs, when in reality it’s more like 3-4%. Please fix this, or I’ll have to put my money elsewhere!!!!"
473,473,3,2019-01-03T20:57:19.000Z,Tinydelta,Almost the perfect weight loss app,"Everything about this app is great except for a couple of things. 1. When I ate something that was not in line with a keto diet, the app did not warn me that that food wasn’t in my diet. I had hoped this app would help me control my cravings. 2. I cannot figure out how to do a shopping list that is pictured in the app preview. This is important as I cannot remember all the ingredients to the recipes when at the grocery store. Fix these issues and I’ll gladly give you the 2 lost stars. Overall it’s not bad for the price especially during the 30% off sub special."
474,474,5,2021-02-23T00:49:22.000Z,RetiredMN,Carbs set at 50%on free version,"Love this app. It is easy and helps you stay focused. Many items already loaded. Some calorie errors but you can correct them. One thing to watch is the free version is set at 50% carb level which is high. 40% is more the recommended but I just do the math and adjust. There are may adjustments if you purchase the monthly plan, wish it was a purchase and not a subscription. Recommended! My husband started using it also.  Enjoy! 😊"
475,475,2,2021-03-31T04:54:06.000Z,VzLa-_-Sw4G,"Pretty, but Needs work","First, I’m willing to change my review if these issues are fixed."
476,476,4,2020-11-18T19:46:25.000Z,JolyG3,Enjoy the interface,"This has been a very easy to use app and I’ve enjoyed tracking calories and meals. You have to buy premium to access the different eating/diet/fasting plans other than calorie tracking — I was disappointed in that at first, as that's what I had wanted, use BUT I’m giving 4 stars still because the daily tracking has been very simple, water count is part of free plan, you can easily see where you’re at and it adds exercise from my phone health app automatically. 👍🏻👍🏻"
477,477,1,2021-02-11T15:08:16.000Z,Steve Colenzo,Barcode scanner and search functions - significantly lacking,This app is extremely sub par when it comes to searching for food and scanning barcodes on food items.
478,478,4,2019-12-22T15:48:57.000Z,Iluvrocket,Very helpful save some bumps,Certainly above average but not perfect. It’s very convenient in keeping track of your calorie count and finding the best foods for you. I love the option to scan barcodes. I like how the app adjusts your allotted daily calories according to your current weight and how many calories you burn.
479,479,1,2020-03-09T18:50:42.000Z,acrofoodie,Poor nutritional database and customer service,I signed up the annual subscription with the option two cancel within two weeks for a refund. I liked the various options for different kinds of diets and recipe ideas.

481,481,5,2019-01-29T18:05:40.000Z,BarcMinHolly3,Life sum is great.,"I personally think this app is good because it makes plans for you that are nice and easy and for the water you can keep track on your fats, protein and carbs. Also this is good so you can see how many steps you have made if you think you are lazy you will be impressed on how many steps you have made. I recommend this app for people who want to be healthy or just for people to know if they are good or bad so you can go see a doctor if you are bad."
482,482,1,2019-02-06T03:35:10.000Z,Xp2020,Could be better,"I loved using the free version enough to purchase it. Only then is when I realized that you can’t customize anything. I like the layout more than fitness pal and it’s all together a beautiful app, but for almost $50, you should be able you customize as much as you’d like. There’s a limit to how many new measurements you can add, you can’t adjust your macros, you can’t adjust your water, and there’s only a hand full of plans. If the app had the option to do all those things it would be the best tracking app out there I’d say. But it doesn’t and I don’t recommend spending your money on it. The paid version is just like the free version. You aren’t missing much."

BUT, I couldn’t even get logged in to the app because I never got past the general information page, where they ask for age, height, current weight and goal weight. It kept telling me the “Too low BMI” when I put in my goal weight - even if I put the weight as 1 pound less than my current weight. Or if I put my current weight as 50 lbs heavier than I was. I tried several different weight combinations with no prevail to get past this page. I tried looking up this problem online and found no answer. Therefore, this app went straight to delete and I guess I’ll try another one!"

486,486,4,2020-10-24T16:19:49.000Z,tangointx,Great app!,Beautiful to look at and add things. I just started to get into tracking my food and tried a couple before this one won me over. It’s so sleek and nice to use. I do wish there was an option where the app could get used to your eating habits and you can add your foods for a couple of weeks before commenting on how much healthier you could be. Also instead of just saying less carbs or fat suggest recipes you could have made. And one little gripe I wish there was an option for a 32oz water bottle
487,487,4,2020-07-21T10:48:37.000Z,Mrheab,Pretty good,It’s a pretty good app all together. It has pretty diverse meal options to track and it has a water counter. It has lots of different diets if you’re willing to pay the extra money.
488,488,3,2020-03-19T17:30:16.000Z,Badxfox,Option to add your own recipes,"I actually really don’t like the fact that I can’t seem to find (or easily find if it’s there) a way to add in my own recipes.  I like to plan ahead my meals and add them into my food diary the night before.  I’m not going to have the option to take a picture of it to see if it can figure out what I’m eating.  It’s also a bit lacking in recipes in general in the data base, when I do a search."
489,489,1,2020-06-15T04:29:20.000Z,crossglowshow,The app keeps saying I’m too young,"I have heard many great things about the app, but I tried to set up an account and the first question they ask is what’s your weight and what’s your goal weight. After I finished typing in my information the keyboard popped up again. So I clicked next and a thing popped up saying I was too young for the app. When I clicked the next button on the bottom of the screen the questions about my weight were still on the screen. So I filled everything out and put my age in and it still said I was too young for the app. I tried deleting the app and re-downloading it, but it still didn’t work. I really hope this gets fixed soon."

It would be great if there was a way to have a recipe book and be able to add each ingredient you have in each recipe. Then you could add any of your recipes with the information already set aside for you so you can add a portion of homemade meals to your daily diet. I know there is a way to do this kind of, but you have to insert each ingredient one by one each time you eat it."

I love all the things you get with it, but it’s really annoying to have the burned calories feature completely stop working. I’ve tried every option to fix it - deactivated my iPhone and Apple Watch connection, restarted my phone, and even redownloaded the app. Still no luck and haven’t heard back from supper yet 😕"
492,492,4,2018-05-21T13:53:04.000Z,Jackie3o3,Great App but needs improvements,I like how I am able to track everything on this app compared to others. It’s great that you can measure your overall fitness and choose a food plan to follow based off your health. But the food recipes in my opinion are lacking. I find them to be a little too much with ingredients. I’ve seen people lose weight just by eating simpler meals than what they offer. I’d appreciate it if they could dumb down the meals for beginners that are starting out that way they have a chance.
493,493,4,2018-08-03T17:02:50.000Z,Lovalamp,I have a suggestion that I believe would help many,"I enjoy this app, it’s very wonderful and easy to navigate. My suggestion is to add a body type feature to help men and women cater to their body type. I’m speaking of the categories of Ectomorph, Mesomorph, and Endomorph. I’d love for the daily caloric intake to be shaped around certain people’s body types. It would help people to target their dietary preferences. Thank you for reading and hopefully this feature will be added in the future as I believe it would be helpful to me and many other people!"

They’re for people have a whole lotta time. I love the scan barcode feature, but I feel it’s necessary to log food because whenever I search for something, it rearely matches up to the nutrition label or I can’t find it at all. Is I scan 99% of things and have to make sure to save it as a favorite in order to find it again. It also doesn’t minus carbs for fiber. But I like that it reminds me to log my weight.

I liked the interface and the kinds of tips they had to offer. Hadn’t been on the app longer than a few minutes before they were offering plans. Premium says it was only a few dollars a month for a wide variety of benefits. Thinking it was a month to month plan only to find out they outrightly charge you $50. They also don’t email you to let you know that you subscribed to it except for a receipt from Apple for an amount. Apple won’t process a refund either. $50 isn’t worth the basic features they give you for weight loss. Spend carefully.

For instance, today my tracker is telling me that after 1 tablespoon of butter in my coffee I still have 50 g of carbohydrates available. Even for the keto medium as this is called that is way too high. Also, as I read a package and get the net carbs they don’t match what you have in your records. They always seem higher. Also, every time I have taken a picture of a UPC it just says this is interesting. I would suggest fine-tuning the keto side of your app."

508,508,3,2019-11-27T13:08:52.000Z,Gabiiiiiiiii36278,Small issue but good overall,"Whenever I add a meal from the meal plan to my diary as tracked it takes a little bit for it to show up. I end up having to add something manually for it to update my diary. I’ll have to go back and delete what was manually entered to keep my diary accurate. It can be frustrating to have to do several times a day, it’s just not as seamless as I feel it could be. Overall, the information is great and the layout is nice. If I had to recommend any premium nutrition app, this would be it based on the plethora of information alone."
509,509,3,2019-10-12T00:21:29.000Z,ThEbEe01,Very helpful but wish I didn’t have to pay for good features,"I love this app, it’s super useful, accurate and has a nice layout. It’s wonderful for anybody who wants to be healthier, and it’s pretty easy to use...BUT I don’t understand why you have to pay for literally all the REALLY GOOD features! I mean, I get that they need to pay for it somehow, but I think that’s a bit excessive. Also, the way they tease you with it. Like “Wanna make healthy choices with a meal plan? HAHAHA that’ll cost you!” I think this app is good, but I’m probably going to download and actually free food tracker and delete this one."
510,510,4,2018-01-05T04:35:01.000Z,Jey12098,Great app so far but...,"Great app so far but I tried to upgrade to the premium and it just sits there trying to load for awhile so I have to force close the application. Also, I don’t understand why it shows “monthly” rates for 3-6-12 months but then takes the whole sum out in one transaction - I feel like that’s pointless and you may as well have it make sense and make it into a 3-6-12 mo contract and take out monthly. Otherwise it’s a great calorie tracking tool and I like the smiley faces, it’s a nice little touch of motivation."
511,511,5,2018-10-25T01:33:12.000Z,Marbaduck,This app is motivating!,My son uses this app and lost 50 lbs and has kept it off 4 months now! I asked him how and he said Lifesum. I would ask him again and he said “Just check in with Lifesum every day! Make sure you record everything you eat!” He made it sound easy and he reassures me it is once you get going! He helped me chose a plan and I’ve started! The easy to use app has lots of fun features and encouragement along the way. Already love it!!
512,512,4,2019-04-17T04:51:22.000Z,Banannnas,"Beautiful, clean tracker","The app works great for tracking intake and monitoring calories and macro nutrients. Sometimes it's a pain to look up foods, especially if you cook a lot at home, but the ""scan the barcode"" feature really helps. I wish there were a way to create a food, ie home cooked recipes, by listing all ingredients and quantities, and then choosing a single serving of that total to track for my meal. Would love more variety (and spell checking!) in the recipes, they are really limited and difficult to understand."
513,513,5,2021-05-25T19:08:26.000Z,Teagen1212,Overall Great App,"Love using this app to track my diet and water intake. One suggestion would be to allow more water setting options. I drink from a 64oz water jug on most days and when I’m not using that one I’m using a 32oz jug. I feel most people are using those two water jugs. It would make it easier allowing one of those as option. With the two options available now, I am not able to calculate my water intake exactly"
514,514,5,2019-11-28T04:07:53.000Z,FossilisedFigBoi,Fantastic,"I simply wanted to make sure I wasn’t eating too much junk and now I can ensure i’m getting enough proteins along with steps and exercise. I’ve actually been eating a bit more (good food) than normal as I realized i’m not eating enough, and I’ve noticed I’ve been loosing fat."
515,515,2,2021-02-23T17:30:43.000Z,Mr. Lucas Brice,I Didn’t Like It,"I had been using MyFitnessPal, and I decided to try this app based on good reviews. LifeSum is less intuitive to use than MyFitnessPal. The biggest problem with this app is that most of the foods I scanned pulled up the wrong nutritional information. Others had a default serving of an entire package of an item, instead of a serving."
516,516,3,2021-01-28T22:20:26.000Z,Jules032,Nice design but inaccurate,I downloaded and decided to give this a shot to see how it compares to some of the other food and calorie tracking apps that I use. The first food I tried to enter was totally inaccurate a d there was no way to change it without creating a new food. Accuracy is pretty important if you are counting calories. On the particular item it was over by 40 calories. I wanted to give it a shot but the inaccuracy straight out of the gate made me decide to delete. The design is really appealing. For accuracy I would recommend Cronometer. For simplicity Lose It.
517,517,3,2019-11-02T16:48:42.000Z,Thicc Pooh,Have to pay,As a watcher of the BramFam channel I saw a video where you sponsored them and then saw the app and decided to get it. That video was made a while ago. The app seemed nice at first but today I tried to see the recipes and found out you had to pay for it. I know when people get sponsored they leave out details so you want to get the app but there’s nothing making this app different because you have to pay for EVERYTHING else. It doesn’t really let me put in the exact thing I ate or drank but I really mainly wanted to try some recipes and I can’t now.
518,518,2,2020-07-26T20:36:07.000Z,sawy boy,Just ok,"While there are some features I like about this ap (user-friendly and ability to sync my health ap to it), there is a glitch that has been happening from the moment I downloaded it. I enter my weight and it’ll log it in. After a few days, it automatically goes back to my original weight (and loses the data that I entered). So, it keeps fluctuating and jumping back to original weight even though I’m not entering that info. I mentioned it to the ap company. They said they knew about it and it hasn’t been fixed in 2 months. I would have bought premium if not for that glitch."
519,519,2,2020-06-23T02:58:12.000Z,Pprinces92,Nice app BUT a lot of kcal are wrong.,"At first I really loved this app and all the features; but as I began using it more I noticed that when I would scan a barcode it would give me the wrong kcal for all the food. This would not be a problem if there were some way to correct it. There also doesn’t seem to be as many stored food options and restaurants as MyFitnessPal, which requires me to go to google to look up everything I eat on cheat days, which is annoying. I really liked this app but I’ll be going back to MyFitnessPal until kcal are corrected and more restaurants and food items are added."
520,520,4,2018-01-20T15:11:38.000Z,MplsWhit,Pretty good- could be better for Keto,I really like this app a lot overall. Nice reminders and tips without being too annoying. Food searching pretty easy and plenty preloaded.
521,521,4,2018-06-06T20:06:20.000Z,Anna (no banana),"It’s great, but...","One thing I do not enjoy is all the brand suggestions the app gives me. None of the brands are the ones I buy, many of them are fast food (I don’t do that either) and a simple homemade option is buried someplace (if even there). So, entering foods in my diary is a bit cumbersome and time consuming. Sometimes I give up on trying to find the fit and choose whatever from the list. But then my score goes down because the app thinks I had fast food. Grrrr.  Otherwise I love this app. Great job, you guys!"
522,522,4,2019-01-19T16:43:39.000Z,gebbie1990,Love this app!,I’ve tried a lot of tracking apps and Lifesum is by far my favorite. I like the challenges to boost my weekly score. My favorite part is that it teaches me the pros and cons of the food I’m eating! There are a bunch of different plans to chose from and a simple quiz to help you find the best plan for your lifestyle.
523,523,3,2019-04-29T21:58:53.000Z,AENP,Lif sum not syncing to Health Properly,"I started to use Lifesum, and after a couple of days I realized that my information wasn’t being synced to the Health app. So I went to setting in Lifesum and turned on the exporting of data to Health again. The next day, the same thing happens, then the next day, again. I sent an email but they haven’t responded. I hope they tell what’s wrong or I think I move to another app with less glitches (in case this ends up being one or that I’m just doing something wrong)"
524,524,5,2019-08-10T21:20:03.000Z,Water Melloon,BEST. APP. EVER.,"seriously. if you’re looking for something to encourage healthy eating, get you started on your fitness journey, or loose weight, this is totally perfect for you. it has a beautiful design, and I love that it still works amazing and has great features without having to go premium! although I can only imagine how much cooler it would be with the added features! if you’re considering a food and exercise tracker, get this one!! you won’t regret it. ☺️"

You can make your own account (which I love) and they send you notifications about things to eat! ( you can choose if you want notifications or not) I love this app so much! If you want to gain or lose weight or just even keep track of your food levels please download this app!!!!!
528,528,3,2020-04-05T15:07:22.000Z,alyssapal,Good app but won't let me purchase premium,"I had this app before on an old Apple ID and loved the premium features. However, now it is not letting me sign up for premium. It advertises 30% off, but then when I try to purchase it does not let me- saying that I am ineligible and the purchase did not go through. Honestly this app isn't worth it to me if I can't go premium, so it's very frustrating that I can't purchase this product when I know it will help me reach my fitness goals. Please fix this glitch!!! I've been trying to purchase premium for days."
529,529,1,2021-02-21T16:26:06.000Z,play 🤘👍👌👋🤙✋️🤜🤛👍🏻,"Unless you opt for premium, this is not worth the time","Found this through the Apple health app. Advertised as free. Answered 41 questions about eating and exercise habits. Was given calculations for goals. Then, to access recipes or suggested eating plans I will need to upgrade to premium. I’ll stick to MFP which has all of the same free tracking options and does waste my time with pop up cartoon questions that require a premium membership for a generic evaluation or suggestions. . So be advised, know if you want any guidance through this app opt for premium or you will waste your time giving Lifesum personal info bec/ no help is given without a cost. There are plenty of other app available."

Lifesum shows me good choices, bad choices and where I stand at the end of the day. The notifications are great encouragement to drink, eat or move. It syncs with my Fitbit so I know what I burn and what I eat. And that’s just the beginning! There are diet plans, recipes, blogs and so much more to help you get to where you want to be."

It's very helpful and a great tool for those who want to loose weight, just get in shape or stay on track. It's got a hand food journal and a lot of really positive aspects."
532,532,4,2018-09-06T00:54:52.000Z,kjhsdgfjhhdbvg,Great health app,Definitely a great app with a lot of potential. I love how it connects with my Health app on my iPhone and it allows me to scan the barcodes of the things I eat for easy access. This app is great for anyone who is health conscious or trying to loose/gain Weight. I see a lot of applications in this app to be used for people trying the Keto diet. My only recommendation would be to work out some of the bugs with the scanner because sometimes the app didn’t give me the right calorie to portion ratio that was printed on the box
533,533,4,2018-12-01T01:17:52.000Z,Chococatinc,Easy to use,"I tried a few different food tracking apps and this seemed to be the most accurate in tracking my exercise and it is easy to use. The only thing I would like is if I could manually add food with any known nutritional values like protein, fat, etc. instead of just having the option of putting calories in only. I also wish there was an option to maintain weight versus only lose/gain weight. Sometimes it stops recording your exercise as well."
534,534,4,2019-03-26T13:51:01.000Z,hockemaster12,"Good, but Very Buggy","Was loving this app both in its design and ease of use. The most recent update pretty much ended that. All of my personal information, custom food, and settings in the app were erased or reset. Causing me to waste quite a bit of time resetting things and emailing support. If these bugs are not fixed soon I probably will not continue using this app."
535,535,1,2019-05-01T05:45:30.000Z,JustMe999,Tedious,The reviews were overwhelmingly positive so I thought why not and went for a 6-month subscription. Big mistake! One of the things that appealed to me when I previewed the app was the variety of plans. The downside was that it doesn’t explain the details of each forcing me to try and research each. After signing up I found that the meals did not appeal to me. I grew up on the Pacific Rim cuisine of Hawaii and I could not see preparing and eating the recipes included. Also it’s extremely difficult to enter food consumed. The inventory is not as comprehensive as another app that I am not naming. Expensive lesson learned as I am not going to be using this for most of the 6 months that I purchased.
536,536,1,2019-12-27T15:34:05.000Z,Shameless cheater,Unfriendly app & total waste of money,I am not sure how this app got such high rating.   Now I understand why the app would not let you have a free trial period before you pay for subscription.  I took a leap of faith based on the ratings & positive reviews which i am sure now are all fakes.
537,537,1,2019-08-21T12:53:58.000Z,llambert5,Not worth it,"This app does not synchronize with your Fitbit or step counter. It doesn’t allow you to update nutritional information of foods that are missing such information on their database. It doesn’t give you a full report of your macro nutrients at the end of each day. It doesn’t allow you to see graphics of your macro nutrients. Long story short, all of these features that are missing are free on my fitness pal. I regret paying $50 to use this app when I could’ve gotten all of this for freeWith my fitness pal. You do get recipes that are specific for your type of diet (vegan, keto, etc.) But you can find it for free extensively on the Internet. This app is not worth it."
538,538,5,2021-03-30T19:16:02.000Z,MissaLynn123,Just the best,"Honestly, I’ve been looking for something simple, easy to use, and still fun/motivating/nice to look at  and this is it. Tried My Fitness Pal, Noom, and a few others I didn’t use for more than a day. Then this one was advertised on IG and I just loved it right away. Still held off on premium for a week first but it’s even better now that I’ve upgraded. It’s helped me stay on track for weight loss a lot."
539,539,3,2020-03-10T21:54:38.000Z,Ali120402,Can’t make your own meals,"I enjoy this app and it’s recipes, however I get things like sub bakery delivered every once and a while and I cook homemade dinners as well, so I would love to be able to make your own meal and edit nutritional information. Sadly it only allows you to enter food items into a meal instead of letting you just input the nutritional values of everything, which makes it extremely difficult when u have many ingredients but I know how many carbs, fats are in it. Sadly disappointing for having to pay for the full service."

But as soon as I downloaded it and put in my info, I realized it doesn’t let me set my macro targets myself. What’s the point of this then?? The carbs were waaaay too high for me to lose weight and the protein was way too low. It’s not useful as is. I have to pay to go premium to get a bunch of features I’m not interested in just to be able to set custom macro targets? There’s not even a free trial to see if going premium is worth it, which every other app I’ve seen has. This is very disappointing. Deleted the app immediately."

When I did that all my information was still there except my membership that I paid for. I tried contacting them of course I get a auto email saying they are too busy to answer my email right now but they’ll get to me as soon as possible.

Meals are rated on a simple scale for their health and calorie tracking is based on whether you intend to lose, maintain, or gain weight. You can search up almost anything you eat to track it or scan the food itself. It’s really helpful!"

Lifesum is really easy and user friendly, I actually WANT to use it. Now that I’m trying to go by macros I wish there was a plan to calculate or custom input your macros & calories. I’m not paying premium just to switch the plan to make it more accurate to what I’m actually trying to achieve. So I leave on its current plan & just mentally check against my own personal macros/calories."

The recipes seem pretty easy and straightforward to make, however the description said that there was a digital shopping list. I can’t seem to find that. How do I know which foods to eat on a Paleo plan that are not part of the recipes? There doesn’t seem to be any food lists in this app that I could work off of and perhaps create my own recipes.

It’s very helpful for creating a balanced meal and I love that you can add your own recipes and meals. I also really enjoy how they made it easy to copy previous days meals from one diary entry to the next. I just wish it gave micronutrient information as well as a way to track supplements!

The app gave me a suggestion to look at certain recipes and then I would try to scroll and look and BAM “Get premium” would pop up again. It is incredibly frustrating and impossible to even use the app when I keep getting badgered to join premium. It seems like all this app is trying to do is take your money. I will be going back to using MyFitnessPal which is way more user friendly and not constantly pushing premium."

However, the food data base is a mess. First, the scanner functionality works about 50% of the time; and second, the food database is SO difficult to use. Users have entered information and, instead of correctly entering serving sizes, have entered unreliable data which makes it incredibly hard to track with accuracy.

Also with the exercises I put some of them in but there aren’t searches for it when I look it would be easier if you could do like a way to put in the exact workout you did."

There are maybe 20 recipes in each category (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and 80% of the breakfast options are basically just some variation of the same egg dish. Also if you select to view all recipes in a category you can’t back up and return to another category. You have to restart the app."

I loved it so much I bought premium and wow, this is definitely the best out there. Lifesum is super user-friendly and fun to use. It has a wealth of features without feeling tedious or confusing. It’s changed and helped my eating habits so much, and really helped me make progress towards beating my disorder. Thank you Lifesum!"
563,563,1,2018-12-31T11:13:29.000Z,Rs04822,Be careful when purchasing premium,"This app is very misleading when purchasing Premium. It gives you a break down of how much you would pay each month when purchasing multiple months. This leads you to believe you paying monthly and can choose to cancel at anytime if you choose. After receiving a $30 bill, I realized that you pay the total upfront and you are not billed monthly. When I reached out to the App Store, I was told the purchase is non-refundable. Even though I am now stuck with the app for a year, I doubt I will even try it now. I am disappointed that I was lead to believe I had the flexibility of cancelling if I chose to do so."
564,564,1,2019-02-21T03:39:01.000Z,Aadhyap,Useful only if you pay,Don’t get this app unless you’re willing to take cash out of your pocket just to get a suggested meal plan from a test. Some other person here wrote a similar review and I couldn’t agree more. I deleted the app right away and downloaded it again just to write this review because I don’t recommend it unless you really want to pay for it. I don’t think you’re gonna get many people wanna download this app if you’re asking for them to pay for something for a suggested meal plan. You’re better of getting more people to want to use your app if you earn money through ads because this just seems like a rip off.
565,565,2,2019-03-15T21:20:38.000Z,thezombiemama,Meh.,"I like the aesthetic of the app so far, but there are a few things that I’m struggling with. It’s slow to sync with my Apple Watch, and it’s impossible to add meals by their macro amounts. For example, i wanted to add a treat (soy green tea frap from Starbucks) and I can’t add it unless I submit each ingredient, rather than inputting the nutrition information from starbucks’ website (title, number of carbs, protein, etc). So I end up just putting it in by number of calories (which rarely works on the first try) and it defeats the purpose. I paid for a year’s subscription— hopefully it gets better from here or I will probably cancel this month."
566,566,4,2020-07-16T18:05:33.000Z,TheTruthHurts!!!!!!!!!,Great but needs a little work,"Great app but definitely some glitches. I’m doing a keto diet and had the strict plan, I wanted to see what the keto medium plan had as a limit for carbs but found it to be too many carbs and now I can’t go back to the strict one. They should let you see all of the plans available vs limiting you based on the quiz. The quiz on a web browser is also different. Making meals/recipes is a little wonky too. Everything else works out great tho. Love the barcode scanner!"
567,567,2,2020-12-09T03:23:39.000Z,hockeychick0207,Just need accurate calories,"All I ask from these apps is that there is an accurate calorie database. I don't even care about macros. I've use this app for two days and it's incredibly inaccurate. Bush country style baked beans - it says 80 cal for half a cup and it's really 160 for a half cup. Van de Kamp beer battered fish fillet says 210 for one fillet when it's really 220 for two. Skippy natural peanut butter is 190 for 2 tablespoons but the app says 190 for 1 tablespoon. These are all listings with a blue checkmark beside them saying that Lifesum has verified them. I am 5'3"" with a small frame so being that far off in calories would make the app completely useless to me."

Really hard to add meals that are my general homemade Mexican dishes because I can never find anything or will have to add everything one by one which defeats the purpose of the app.
570,570,5,2018-01-01T17:48:15.000Z,Toca Boca love❤️,Great Health Tracker!,I’m loving life sum because it doesn’t push you hard to eat healthier. It just helps you set your goal and accomplish it! It is a amazing app in all but I have one problem. I would like to count my steps. When I go to count my steps it says choose you goal. I choose my goal. But when I hit set it doesn’t save it! If you could possibly fix this I would be very thankful. But overall this app is incredible!
571,571,2,2019-03-23T06:18:09.000Z,CJ.M.,So many bugs.,"I really want to love the app but I’m having so many issues. The app never connects to the internet so I can’t use certain features, I have to click “+” for every single pound I weigh instead of being able to type it in, I can’t connect through FB or my email (the buttons just don’t work), I can’t update goals because the app can’t connect to Internet (I also have it okay to use data), and the calories eaten and burned are always at 500 and 300 respectively. No way will I pay for an app with so many issues. I do enjoy the branding aesthetic and food tracking."

They do have a membership that you can pay for to get more “tools” but like other people I don’t want to pay for a membership. Unless you want to use the app to find and save recipes or want more food ratings, then you don’t need the paid membership. Anyways, I don’t usually do reviews but I just had to share how great this app is."
574,574,3,2020-12-07T00:15:26.000Z,Irishsavvy,It’s Okay,"This app is just like every other calorie counting app on the market, but what adds a little value is the real time “feedback” you receive in the way of emoji faces to indicate if the food you’re eating is good, neutral, or bad. My only complaint is they keep trying to promote this new Life Score thing, but every time I take the test it crashes while I’m halfway through and then it won’t allow me to try taking it again for like a month. I’ve gone through this cycle like three times. Seemed like a cool feature if only it worked."

I like how it calculates net carbs and the app is visually appealing. However, I am so disappointed with the bugs! First of all, I’ve used many diet/fitness apps and never had calories and macros so off as this! One listing of a cup of pistachios says 170 and another says 617!! Also the measurements are way off on a lot of items. One tablespoon of half and half is 3.5 ounces?!! And then the calculations are off. For example I put in 2 tablespoons of half and half which is 40 calories, and then 3 tablespoons is 105! Please fix these issues!"

It’s more helpful than professional providers I have go to for help. I wish I had found it sooner and the paid plan is worth every penny!"

I accidentally forgot to record my weight yesterday, and needed to update my weight today. For some reason, every time I put in my weight (only 1.5lbs lighter than the last time i updated it in app) the app gives me a notification saying they thought I typed the wrong numbers and wanted me to try again. I’m super frustrated as I obviously want to track my progress, but cannot. Is it because it thinks I lost weight too quickly? I’m pretty young and have had an active lifestyle my whole life, so losing 1.5lbs in ~2-3 days isn’t concerning to me."
578,578,1,2020-07-05T03:47:59.000Z,Coheed1@1,Lacking in homemade foods.,"Lifesum does a pretty good job if everything you eat is from a known restaurant. The database for homemade foods in extremely lacking. You can always look up brand name foods but if you eat chicken breads with rice and broccoli good luck finding and accurate nutrient spread without adding it yourself. Really makes me angry because this is basic foods. I made a half pound Hamburger and salad and I can’t get a proper count, but a Big Mac or some obscure fast food is easily found. Honestly the only reason I’m using this app is because I made a mistake and purchased it because I thought I was choosing Lose It. Maybe check them out before paying for this one."
579,579,1,2020-05-12T23:32:48.000Z,ctctlc24,Change of heart,I’ve been using the premium version of this app for almost a year. I loved the interface and how easy it was to use. I also enjoy the ability to connect my exercise and my scale so that I don’t have to manually enter those things in the app every time. As of late the app has been very glitchy! It logged a weight for me incorrectly and I can’t figure out how to remove it. I was missing the updated plans and only had the option of 4 plans. Like other users have stated the food log database is way off and the scanner will not work sometimes just keeps scrolling. Back on the hunt for something better!

The recipes I love. I love that I can give myaelf a check up on how I eat and drink and the type of workouts I do."

WHICH i wouldnt be so against if i had the option to pay monthly, not the entirety of a year all at once."
582,582,2,2018-08-07T01:16:46.000Z,melynam,Still no progress with the app...,"The app still has its tracking issues. There was an obnoxious work around of logging out and back in and resetting the automatic tracker. Now it is no longer saving the want to track NetCarbs, as well as not being able to set my personal macros. I think it may be time to cancel my subscription. I kept giving it a chance after the update that killed the tracking because all of my stuff has been stored for months. At this point, i’ll just count it as a loss and find a reliable app to use. I really liked LifeSum, so disappointed."

Trying to search for foods, even just basic ones, is like pulling teeth. I searched eggplant, and nothing came up. The meal plans themselves leave a lot to be desired, and honestly, seem a little bit sketchy to me. I also don’t like feeling like I’m being shamed for food that I eat with the little frowny faces or smiling ones. Especially when they’re not even necessarily accurate. Healthy foods that I’ve eaten have been given an :|. I’ll stick with My Fitness Pal. It might not be as pretty, but at the very least, it seems more accurate."

It is off on multiple days. For example. Today remaining macros are 49c 16p 19f. That equals 431 calories but app is saying 465 remaining. This has been happening everyday. Might not be a big deal to some for for those of us trying to dial in our nutrition it is incredibly frustrating. Not satisfied with this app anymore. And no I am not consuming anything like alcohol that would affect the calories and not the macros
585,585,3,2019-04-29T16:50:41.000Z,nibiplin,Aggravating,"I did like many aspects of this app, but there were some things that were very aggravating which is why I deleted instead of purchasing premium. 1. I answered vegan in my questionnaire and yet I was recommended non vegan meal ideas. 2. I accidentally entered a whole day of meals on the wrong day and could not find a way to easily change the date instead of having to delete everything and re-enter on the correct day. 3. Food database isn’t the best and I could not figure out how to add my own foods or my own measurements."

Only request: add options to customize workout/ exercise plans. Some of us are starting over after surgery or long term inactivity. So, these limited choices-“moderate aerobic exercise” are not applicable for us. No option for stationary biking that I can see....Otherwise, this app is just right! Thanks!"
587,587,5,2020-06-12T23:52:26.000Z,Magpie101hi,Yes👏🏻,Honestly my favorite thing about this app is that it’s not enforcing that you need to eat less to lose weight. It gives your meal a bad rating not only if you overeat but also if you undereat. Also I love that I can just scan the barcode of something. And also how it factors in different types of exercise. Lastly I love how it gives you water tips. Overall great app! Even without the whole premium thing!

Very pleasantly surprised the developers saw my review and addressed the problem. The Login with Apple ID now works. Thanks for addressing. Haven’t yet determined whether I’ll subscribe but will update rating again if/when I do. Personally, I’d prefer a free trial of seven days like most subscription apps offer (with automatic renewal payment at end of trial), otherwise pretty expensive service to try without full confidence it will do and track what I want it to track."

However, you can’t do much because most of it is limited to paying for premium. Also, one thing I would like to change is that this app sends you lots of spam mail. There is an option where you can unsubscribe from it, I have tried to unsubscribe multiple times but it always fails to deliver the unsubscription mail so I don’t know how to stop getting them unless I delete the app."

After planning all day and buying food to complete all the recipes, the app decided to crash every time I click the plans tab. Now I just updated yesterday to the newest version, and the plans tab has worked fine all day- until I finally decided to track a meal. Since then it’s crashed every time I’ve clicked the plans tab, I’ve restarted redownloaded so just beware!"

All I’ve been told is to log out and log in which has done nothing. My data is gone, the macros are way off, I have to resync with phone daily, and the exercise tracking is waaaay off. Used to love this app but the latest update has rendered it useless and getting support is like pulling teeth. I’ve emailed, tweeted, and contacted in app but have had minimal response just telling me to log out. Case was closed by company without resolution :( I hope they fix this because this was my go to app for calorie and exercise tracking."

I have been using this app for a week now. I have been using it mostly to track my net carbs since I am a newly diagnosed diabetic. With eating less refined carbs, drinking water and intermittent fasting, I’m down 5 lbs this week! This App is a huge benefit to reaching my health goal. I go back to see my endocrinologist in Jan and I am hoping my A1C will be down!"
596,596,2,2020-04-21T18:35:48.000Z,TLG612,Can’t add anything since the “update”,"I really like the idea of being rated on the quality of food I’m eating instead of just the calories in it. It’s more helpful to be told why a food is unbalanced instead of getting on the scale every week or so and wondering why your hard work isn’t paying off. However, whoever programmed this app kind of dropped the ball. Whenever you give it too many commands in row, it just crashes which isn’t ideal for an app, especially one that’s being paid for."

For example, it automatically defines your serving as, let’s say, 2 tablespoons, but you can’t edit the number. So if you only had 1 tbps, you’d have to write it as 1/2 serving. Not that big of a deal, but annoying if you’re accustomed to more flexible UI. Similarly, the ads for getting premium service are obnoxious and make navigating the app frustrating at times."
598,598,3,2019-08-26T02:19:01.000Z,WhistlerNate,Watch app not good,"While this app is pretty good (if you pay for premium), it leaves a Lot to be desired for the Apple Watch version.  Very little functionality for the watch. It doesn’t really do anything, and won’t update my “calories burned” which always stay at “0”, despite my workout, health, and activity apps showing that’s not the case.  Not impressed with this app. Even less impressed they force you to pay for subscription for just basic functionality, and again; nothing useful for Apple Watch."

However, I don’t recommend following the amount of calories it tells you to eat especially if you input how many calories you burned during your workout. The amount is way too high. As long as you know how many calories you need to eat this app is great. I chose the lose weight option and it told me I needed to be eating over 4000 calories which is way off."

I even tested the app myself and the calorie counts are very accurate. If you want to keep track of what and how much you eat I definitely recommend this app!"

I was thinking of buying the upgrade version but I just realized I input my lunch and when I opened it again it was missing. I’d hate to have to input my meals over and over because it’s not being saved correctly. I really like everything about the app but that one thing would frustrate me. Can it be fixed?

Well none of that exists on my app once I paid. So I basically just spent money on nothing. Why don’t I have these features? What am I paying for? I see that other people are able to make the meal plan but I can’t. This is very frustrating, I do like the rest of the app but the fact I paid for your 3 week program advertisement and it’s a false advertisement. The 3 week program is not on the app. And premium does not give you access to it. Very disappointed...."

I’m fairly conscious of what I eat already - or so I thought - but this makes me think twice before I mindlessly snack on something because I know I’ll have to log it later. I feel full of energy and excited to eat well, which is no small feat! Also love the barcode scanner which makes keeping a food diary so much easier."

I wish they constantly add more inspirational recipes from all over the world. Personally, because I'm from Japan, I  wish they include more REAL Japanese good. After three months, I get bored looking at the same recipes and having hard time to go back on my diet. People at Lifesum, if you are reading this review, please work on this matter.

But it continues to get changes instead of fixing old bugs, or new bugs instead - or worse, in addition to - existing bugs. Recent versions (since even before the new version 12) have frozen frequently and at very inopportune times, usually resulting in the app crashing or my having to force restart it. Then it takes minutes to start up again (iOS 13 and 14). I won’t be renewing my subscription this year."

With that being said, users who are using this for free already have such limited access to features on this app so I will admit I became quite frustrated when I noticed that the graph that depict ones overall calorie intake over the course of the week was not showing the calorie intake every third day despite having filled out my food intake for those days (also frustrating I can’t show my proof but that’s neither here not there)."

This is not worth the monthly commitment. If I were only looking to track my macros many apps does it completely free, really only signed up for the menu planning but with such few choices it is worth paying for the app. I also reached out to the Contact us and no response after 4 full days after multiple efforts on my side to reach out. Very disappointed :("

614,614,1,2020-10-09T22:50:24.000Z,Jojo'sXGhoul,Vegan propaganda,"I eat mostly animal products, because they have the most bio available and highest amounts of micronutrients compared to plant products. Protein too, because I want to be fit and plants are lower in protein by calories and amino score. Though this is basic knowledge, this app doesn’t allow you to specify you eat grass fed only and that all the meat you eat must be conventional low quality meat. Your health score is based off the amount of plants you eat and though I hit all my micronutrients almost everyday, I’m classified as “unhealthy”. Also, the biggest issue is the premium. It’s not monthly, so if you want to cancel, well there goes $40 to $80."
615,615,1,2020-10-02T05:54:15.000Z,breizhnoelfrancias,Says its vegan/allergen friendly but its really not,"Has no diet plans for vegans or vegetarians. Fighting to get my money back now. What a disappointment. I can see how this would be useful for people who eat meat, though—otherwise, not many choices or options to choose from, and not as customizable as advertised. However, the calculator for the macros isn't beneficial and doesn't guide you through what the proper % balance would be for your goals. It presets it but not to what would be accurate for what your goals are. The app isn't exceptionally user friendly all in all. Great concept of an app, though; just needs a lot of work."

This is frustrating because I like to see my progress on the line chart and the data is incorrect and doesn’t give me an accurate representation of how my weight loss has progressed. I have tried to delete my account and start over but it seems that this is not an option. I am very tempted to delete the app altogether and try something else."

Ever since upgrading the app has been so horribly inconsistent. In my food diary one time when I open the app my Fitbit data is there, and gone the next time I open it up. Its hard to keep track of the recommendations on what I should eat when there’s no consistency in the app. Besides the diet recommendations, my weight and water intake are constantly being reset on me as well. So many bugs in the premium version. Hope they get this stuff figured out."
618,618,4,2019-07-25T04:03:20.000Z,Tayyvo,Brand New User! - But Slight Issue,So far I love it! I have been reading about Intermittent Fasting and was thrilled to see a 5:2 plan being offered. The one issue that was bothersome for me was that the Daily Progress bar is a day ahead of my tracked day. Ex: I recorded my meals on Wednesday July 24th but then see it portrayed in Thursday’s Daily Progress bar. It’ll then tell me I ate too many calories that day because it was meant to be a fasting day. I’m not sure how well I explained that but perhaps it was my own mistake.

620,620,3,2018-01-02T15:19:36.000Z,DustyBaker.78,Good Concept But...,I like the idea of this app-- tracking food/exercise weather it's to get in shape or stay in shape. However the food ratings seem to be way off. Whenever I add a healthy food it always has a frowny face saying it is high in carbohydrates-- honestly we NEED carbs for energy and I just find it pathetic that a banana has a frowny but a frozen food high in sodium has a smiley face. I find it upsetting and I think it could lead people in the wrong direction! Is there anyway to turn off the smiley+frowny faces because fruit+veggies+legumes+etc. are NOT unhealthy :)

But once I leave my house it’s stops loading everything! I go to look up foods in the search bar and nothing comes up, and it’s not like it’s loading, there’s no loading bar. And my service isn’t bad, even when I’m under a different WiFi or have 4 bars of service it still doesn’t even try to load anything.

I like to cook allot and Lifesum allows me to create recipes using the foods I use. It’s great! My only problem is I like to make my food for the day before but, when I go to enter in my food there seems to be some glitch that adds that food to the current day. I’m always have to go back and erase data and renter it on the correct day"

It makes tracking food is super easy and pretty fun actually. I think I bounced in and out of Ketosis a lot before I started using this app, I feel on track all the time now. I’m sure there are other good apps and this is the only one I’ve tried, but I don’t have any reason to look further."
626,626,5,2020-06-11T19:50:44.000Z,Scoopsequalslov,Best tracking app!,I absolutely love this app. I HATED tracking my food until I found this. I love that it actually grades your food and gives you a breakdown on how well you ate for the week and where you can improve. It’s a game changer. I’m so much more aware of how much I’m eating and it allows me to still have “balance” and not worry about eating perfect 100% of the time. I even upgraded to the premium version.
627,627,4,2020-06-25T00:57:15.000Z,violetdream666,Good app,She actually really like this app. I do t really have anything to say as far as changing the app other than maybe add just a few options of personalizing the color and also making a way to be able to change your profile picture. If there is a way to change profile picture than can we make it easier to because I’ve looked everywhere to be able to change it.

It helps me eat less calories and I have already dropped 2 lbs. The reason I got this app is because I am going on vacation and trying to slim down a little before I go. If your busy mom  like me you will love this app. Plus , you are able to scan the labels to food as well! Overall , I am very impressed ☺️"

It’s extremely helpful and I’m able to hold myself accountable.

It appears to have a ton of helpful features including meal plans and recipes. But my only gripe is that if I add my own food item I can only enter the calories. There’s no way to add fiber, carbs, fat, etc. I would love this so I don’t get frowny grey faces for cooking my own food. If this feature is in here and I’ve just overlooked it then disregard this and it would be 5 stars!"

But should work on making small things more organized. Ex. Your favorites by what kind of meal they are (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack), also should keep the plans page the same, but extend it so that underneath what it already has you can see all of the plans and not just the ones it shows. Don’t let this opinion get in the way of the app though. Definitely a great app!"

I appreciate all of the awesome diets and the way it motivates you to keep your diet balanced. Yet, it randomly stopped syncing with my watch, so it no longer tracks my active energy, and often times I have to update foods multiple times before it actually accepts the changes."
633,633,2,2019-04-18T22:55:11.000Z,jzjgzfjzjfzhfzfhzffj,Bad customer service,I would like a refund for this app.  I requested via email per lifesum instructions and received a response about longer than usual wait times. They have never responded back to me at all.  The app is pretty easy to follow but has limited capabilities.  You cannot pull in recipes which makes it impossible to track and very limited food choices after awhile.  Great things is ability to scan bar codes & ease of use.  But customer service is very important to me for any service so due to that situation I would not recommend it.
634,634,5,2019-07-11T21:48:48.000Z,chunsangmi4,Really liking it!,"After having tried a couple of other popular food trackers, I have stuck with this particular one because you can see the general macros for each day.  It also helps that the interface is pleasing to the eye and although the database for food isn’t as extensive as those from the other apps, I find that it’s enough for what I need."
635,635,4,2020-05-26T08:47:06.000Z,EWinWES,Pretty nice,"I’m mostly using this for a food journal, and I’m largely satisfied. However, it does glitch sometimes and randomly changes my birth date or my calorie goal (and not because of exercise, sometimes I wake up and haven’t done/eaten anything and it’ll have changed already). It also doesn’t always scan barcodes correctly (i.e. the wrong kind or flavor of drink even if the brand is correct). Other than that I do really like the app."
636,636,2,2020-05-12T14:58:05.000Z,Divergentdaydreams,Decent but a lot of glitches,"I decided to splurge & purchase the premium version of this app. The app seems easy to use at first, but once you start using it on a daily basis it fails, and fails hard. To put it bluntly, it’s been a big disappointment and I will be requesting a refund from apple."
637,637,4,2020-01-14T17:41:02.000Z,antlerblood.,More water size options,"Love this app, it’s beautiful, but I would love to see more water bottle size options, I always carry my 40 oz water bottle with me as it is a more sustainable and eco friendly option. I would love the app to encourage the use of refillable water bottles in various sizes, such as 8 oz, 12 oz, 16 oz, 24 oz, 32 oz, or 40 oz that way it is much easier to keep track. I also would love to see more options for portions such as measurement and weight options. Other than that I love it!"
638,638,4,2019-08-05T02:43:53.000Z,KevinAmiri,Ok App but could be a lot better!,There isn’t much explanation as to what the features are. It shows Carbs but doesn’t tell you if it is net carbs! Why not show both.

640,640,3,2018-01-04T19:35:19.000Z,Czinn123654,Good App,"This is a good app. The design is great. The problem is that the daily intake tab isn’t worked my correctly. I have my daily calories set to 2800 and it always says “/3000” to start. As I enter food throughout the day it rises. And usually ends up around “/3600”. This doesn’t make any sense? Also the serving size calculator is incapable of simple math and will say one serving of something is 200 calories, but when I type two servings it says 399 which is frustrating. Fix these things and the app will be much better."
641,641,2,2018-01-15T23:12:09.000Z,girdyt,"Great app, but don’t pay for it!",I like how this app gives you a rating for each food you eat so you are more aware of what you are putting into your body. However I don’t feel like it is beneficial enough to pay for it. The app doesn’t have tons of foods you can search like on MyFitnessPal which is frustrating. A lot of foods i do search are off on calorie count. Makes me question their accuracy on macros as well.
642,642,1,2018-04-05T04:42:06.000Z,karlaleja,Team MyFitnessPal,"I got a bit carried away with the aesthetics of Lifesum and purchased the premium version without much thought, I was quickly disappointed. I would scan in my everyday food items and the nutrition facts were off by a lot on about everything, taking the time to edit each item of food was enormously inconvenient! I’ve used MyFitnessPal since 2013 and I’ve never had any issues with it! It’s way easier to use and most importantly it is actually accurate which is the entire point of counting calories and macros. I’m currently waiting on my refund from Lifesum and will be back on MyFitnessPal ASAP!"
643,643,5,2019-05-18T02:21:46.000Z,Cheese gnome,dont worry i wont whine about water bottle sizes because this is great,"the app is visually appealing and nice to use.  i do wish they would add more diet plans like diabetic or other such restrictive, but necessary plans but I understand each user can still customize.  Peole need to think for themselves and tailor their plan to fit their needs, without the whining about customizing water bottle sizes or extreme maco counting.  think for yourselves and rock on"
644,644,5,2020-10-12T18:39:15.000Z,Teglia,Amazing I love it!,I previously used this app for free just to track my eating habits I love how it’s easy to understand and use. I recently upgraded to premium and omg best thing ever! The recipes are easy and quick to make and delicious and I love the shopping list feature were you can just tap the recipes and it adds what you need to your shopping list and you can easily cross off what you have. AMAZING !!!
645,645,3,2021-03-15T14:10:07.000Z,GingerZoe,"User appealing, less user friendly if free","I love the design, layout, & concept for this app, but unfortunately can’t justify purchasing the Premium version. Because of this, I can’t save recipes/meals I often make, so I have to manually enter each ingredient & estimate amounts... pretty tedious. The free version almost discourages home cooking & encourages pre-packaged foods because of this inconvenience. The Premium version seems awesome, and the app is cute enough I’ll keep it, but I’ve fallen off & on of using it because of the tedium of logging things."
646,646,5,2019-07-19T14:29:00.000Z,Boomwormwithheadphones,I love this app,It has so many great features! There are several plans to choose from to help you decide what your macros should be. The graphics are super cute. It’s very easy to track food. But it’s also great to track weight and other body measurements. You can easily customize the measurements to include anything that you think is missing. The graphs are amazing for measurements and for food.
647,647,4,2020-09-18T15:00:12.000Z,shahfigoendisj,Like don’t love,"The app really won’t do much except track your food and exercise. Unfortunately after tracking a meal or work out, it will randomly disappear and either end up on another day or just be gone. It’s kind of frustrating."
648,648,1,2020-06-22T13:02:20.000Z,Shay 0223,Very limited weight loss/health resource.,"I have purchased apps that promote similar attributes to assist in weight loss and healthy eating. In all honesty, this has been the most disappointing. Here are my reasons:"

650,650,1,2017-12-28T23:28:49.000Z,Swoasis,Terrible,I'm greatly disappointed by this app. So after a few days of using the app I noticed that the app doesn't have customized foods like for example a hamburger with no bun and I bought one of the premium memberships and realized that the recipes that come with it are extremely limited for the price that I payed for. I could've bough 4-5 large cookbooks with the money I used. Other fitness apps like fitness pal is a lot better than this and it's FREE. Don't bother with the membership. Wish I could get my money back.
651,651,4,2018-03-04T00:56:42.000Z,Noel.000,Would recommend,"This app is great because you can set goals and get help along the way. Of course there’s premium like there is for everything, but they shove it in your face in a way that’s not as annoying as other things. You can also not get premium and still use 60% of it, unlike other apps where if you don’t get premium you get like 10% of the thing. It’s pretty nice overall and I would recommend it."
652,652,3,2018-09-10T14:53:16.000Z,runnergirl620,Issues Syncing Apple Watch,"I pay for a premium membership and sync my data via my Apple Watch, however, I very consistently have issues where probably twice a week the data and steps do not upload to the app. This is very frustrating as this happens quite often. Other than that, the app is great, but the issue with step and calorie tracking makes me consider using a different app. But I paid for a year long membership, so that is why I continue to use the app."
653,653,1,2019-01-04T05:56:01.000Z,Joshieeee2,Could be perfect but very deceiving at moment,The description sounds like you will be able to generate a grocery list from the recipes in your program to plan the week based on your meal plan. Why is this feature missing?
654,654,4,2019-01-10T16:08:34.000Z,MuzicMan294,Make tracking a little easier,"Love the app overall, have been using for quite sometime and love it. One suggestion I have that I think would tremendously helpful would be to be able to adjust the water settings for tracking. You have a glass and a bottle and that’s it. I wish we could change the ounces to match our reusable bottles or whatever container we use to make the tracking easier. Otherwise great app."
655,655,3,2019-06-06T15:16:32.000Z,thelovingchoice,Love but disappointed,"I’m a premium subscriber because I love the app and the various plans, especially the variants of Keto.  However....the foods “verified by Lifesum” are often wrong! This makes me crazy. I’m a weigh and measure person who knows food and labels. They’re wrong more often than they are correct.  I’m tired of reporting them in app.  For example, “1 cup” of pumpkin seeds is reported as 170 cal—that’s the correct info for 1/4 cup.  Please have someone review the entire database, especially the “verified.”  Whoever did that work doesn’t understand labels!!!"
656,656,5,2019-11-01T13:32:06.000Z,WlkrHntr,Great app,Love this tracking app along with recipes and stats.  Keeps me on track.  I also like the varied meal plans.  Only comment would be if you select USA during set up to put the ingredients in ounce measures.  Everything is in grams and to convert most of the time is a bit of a pain.  Other than that I think this is the best tracking and meal plan out there that syncs with your phone and Apple Watch.
657,657,4,2020-09-20T02:54:08.000Z,antramusic,Really great but wish there were more plans,Really like the layout and aesthetic of the app and especially with premium. Only wish there were more fasting plans for “intermittent fasting” on daily basis and not just the extreme 6:1 or 5:2. So something like skipping breakfast and then having calories consumed during late lunch and dinner etc. just a thought hope to see more premium features!
658,658,1,2019-11-15T16:24:25.000Z,Emin Emini,Horrible experience + Free features made payable,"Waste of money! I payed for 3 months and I had terrible experience. There are only a couple of plans, like weight loosing. They say that there are different of plans but no, it’s a lie! Also you cannot change your plans after you choose it, cause there are tons of bugs. I contacted several times the support and they didn’t care about my concern. Time passed and they didn’t refund me. And what is the worst part, they offered some features for free, now they made them payable! I hate companies that does that."
659,659,5,2019-07-25T23:25:22.000Z,Hdtkfthfr,Cool app,Super amazing app overall if you’re trying to track calories and what makes this app even better is that it als tracks the calories you lost and matches it to the calories you still need to eat. Personally I think thats a really neat trick and also I love the fact that you can sync your Apple Watch to this app to track the cals you lost on the watch !! Pretty amazing if you ask me !
660,660,1,2018-03-10T14:17:41.000Z,Vgz,"Good app, terrible support.","I ran into an issue where I had an empty account attached to my email and was trying to attach that email to the app to avoid losing the data I had already logged. When I emailed support about the issue, making it clear that I wanted to avoid losing the data in the app, they responded a day later telling me to logout of the app, which would erase the data. When I responded stating that was exactly what I wanted to avoid and asked them to delete the account attached to the email they never replied back. If you’re worried about ever needing tech support, avoid this app and look for another option."

I’m noticing that when I try to add food/ingredients to a meal, the app will not update that meal. I created a meal recently and tried to add more ingredients (after the app unexpectedly shut down). After an ingredient was entered, the app wouldn’t let me exit to update the meal. As a result, I haven’t been able to accurately track my meals. A little frustrating, but I’m still keeping the app 😊"

My disappointment is I can import recipes from online like with MFP... that is annoying and cumbersome. As a health coach, I also can’t see my clients profiles like MFP. This tool would be much easier for them to use but without being able to check in with them... it can’t serve as a tool for them. So close! Some slight improvements and this app would be the ultimate!"
663,663,4,2018-10-10T12:27:00.000Z,AZJaguar1,Not enough customizing food,"The app is very nice, been loosing weight after downloading it. The only thing that I have an issue with, is the adding calories. That’s all it dose, is add the calorie count. I do a lot of cooking. I know the nutrition values, but can’t add those in. So if you eat something high in proteins or fibers, the app will not recognize that when you manually enter the calories. If they add the option to write your own nutritional label I will give it a five star instead."
664,664,3,2018-12-06T02:17:16.000Z,Snarkymom23,It’s Okay,"This app is okay. I like the look much better than My Fitness Pal, but the servings are difficult to figure out. Who is eating 1.5 servings of bread? It’s either one or two slices, not 1.5 servings. I’ve no need to try to figure out the math of what I’m eating. I bought the premium for the recipes, but am probably not going to use it for tracking."

The only thing that I think that should need to have , its the option to add  your own recipes and get the calories, like my fitness app”. But for the rest it’s a great app, the scan food it’s excellent.  I want to remark that I am using the app without the membersy, only the free options."

It has everything you need to get started. The only thing I have to say is that just make sure to use it all the time for yourself. Great free app! Will be getting the prime version soon! I have started to feel better and started working out more. Thank you!

It’s fun to use. However, the fact that you need a paid premium membership to customize your macros is a huge let down. Especially when there are free tracking outs out there that let you do it. It’s the reason I always go back to MyFitnessPal. I would switch to LifeSum if they let up on this feature and made that free.  My nutrition goals change and I need the ability to change it myself."
669,669,3,2019-10-02T21:06:27.000Z,DessiDiva 👸🏽,Good app but...,"The app is visually appealing and easy to use. I love the fact that you can take pictures of your food and it gives you the calories for it, but when it comes to logging in workouts it’s annoying. Some workouts you don’t time, you do reps (Ex. Squats, push-up, etc.). It’s annoying that you can only log in the amount of time that you did that workout for. If this gets changed then u would give a a five star rating but because of this issue I can’t do that."

However, 1: The age that you have on the App Store doesn’t match on the app. 2: It was quite confusing to navigate at first. If a tutorial was created that walked the user through everything before letting them access the app, I feel that it would be less confusing."

Then they told me, essentially, ‘Too bad, so sad, you’re SOL.’ They don’t know how to fix the problem and don’t know when it will be fixed. And, no, they won’t refund what I paid. I’ll have to go through Apple for that. The moral? Don’t give them any money."

Typically vegan is also high carb, low fat, whole foods (whole foods meaning fruits, vegetables, nothing processed). Keto is a low carb, high fat, meat galore diet that I am so not interested in. I was excited for this app until I realized their diet plans are entirely tailored to low carb keto. It’s infuriating. This app is exactly what I wanted until I realized they are front runners for keto. I want a plan for EVERYONE. Meat eaters, paleo, keto, vegetarian, all the other diets out there, AND VEGAN. It’s not fair to push one diet in an app that’s made for people looking for options."

I always double check new food I track, because I have found several incorrect foods. I would love to see the ability to create a manual or custom plan based on your individual macros. I think that would make it a five star app for sure."

I just wish there was a way to set up your own macros. I know the ones in there working really well, but I’m trying to play around with mine and wanted to enter them manually, but can’t. Do you know if that’s a future feature you plan on adding like a “customize your own”?"

All it shows you on your watch is what you’ve logged on your phone with no option of adding intake through the watch itself. A little bit upset since I’ve already paid for a premium account had I known I can’t log right through my watch I wouldn’t have purchased premium. Other than that the little Apple character is a cute touch.

I think it will go well but I have two complaints. I’m the calorie tracker it has the amount of calories on the wrong days. Saying I skipped somedays and ate on days I haven’t started yet. Also on the plans tab it no longer has a summary of my plan just the “take a test” screen. I liked the meal layout the 3-week had. Not saying it needs meals but maybe tips and goals for the diet.

Screwing around counting everything in an app is a pain, and I am disappointed that this one is no different. Half the things I track have incorrect values, when you click on “edit food” it won’t let you change the mistake in the database. It is also common to scan something and have it come up as another. Sorry guys. I had high hopes, now I feel stupid for paying the fee. Maybe I’m just hangry."

I couldn’t and had to email the app developers it’s been a week in a half with no response from them, and I still have no access. I’m upset because this app is not cheap and I have been needing to use it. I’m very disappointed and would like a refund. I only have 14 days, but idk if they’ll even see it by that time. Who knows?"

Of course, you don’t know this until you pay the $30 for a 6 month subscription to their service. I attempted to contact the company to get this remedied, they offered a refund, but Apple is not working with me on this. I am so annoyed I wasted $30 on a program I can’t even use. I really like the design and other functions of the app too, if only it worked as expected."

When you buy it, you find out that there are not a lot of recipes that are keto compatible (less than 10g of carbs per meal). There are less than 20 recipes. They are still working on building their database for tracking macros, so it’s difficult if you are in the US to just find a meal that already has the macros. It’s also difficult to find very common foods and ethnic food. Yes it is pretty and the user interface is better than MyFitnesspal — but I will take function over UI any day! You also have to at minimum get 3 months. Save your $20!"

I have a vegan lifestyle and that would make this app loads better! I will probably give a rate of 4 so as long as the premium is worth its price. That’s really the only complaint I have! Please look into that, I would really love to see a vegan option on the app. Other than that I really like it so far! :)"

I purchased the upgrade and I’m very pleased with it. My husband downloaded a different app and it’s not nearly as good. The design is nice and it’s very user friendly. I just wish so bad that I could add my own recipes, it would make it so much easier! I find myself entering lots of ingredients and guessing the quantities I ate."

687,687,3,2021-01-12T13:39:46.000Z,malkon67,Great for Calorie Counting,If you are counting your calories and generally keeping track of your carbohydrates the app is great. It’s low profile and integration into Apple Health is pretty seamless. My chief complaint is the ability to to count my Active & Exercise   against my carbs and not just my calories. I find that counting carbs and using my net carbs is a great way for me to lose weight fast. I signed up for the year and after six months I dropped the app. That alone is a testament to how many good features the app has.
688,688,3,2020-05-18T17:54:58.000Z,kae248,Several bugs are inaccuracies,I got really frustrated having to look up calories elsewhere to confirm them - sooo many foods are listed incorrectly in the database. Measurements for foods are all wonky too. Weight tracker kept reverting to my starting weight. You can’t edit or remove favorite meals.
689,689,2,2019-10-14T01:37:11.000Z,roamingzia,Don’t bother with premium or maybe this app at all,"I just paid for premium. I started a planned meal program and there is a button to add things to a shopping list... but that shopping list doesn’t exist anywhere that I can find. Also looking through thing they just recycle about 4-5 recipes so really repetitive. Finally a future start date to plans would be cool. From what I see these are things others have said for a long time, so probably not changing. Sad I paid now, but glad I did it for the shortest amount of time."
690,690,1,2017-12-22T19:24:46.000Z,bsmejkal,New details interface ruined the only reason I used this app.,The details interface used to work perfectly for tracking my macros intake and ratios. I eat a keto diet and need to make sure I always have enough fats and protein and not too many carbs. The old interface showed a pie graph and the exact macros already consumed. With the new chart you can only see what you have left to consume according to the diet you’re on. Now you have to pay for the premium account to see any graphs and change the diet so it fits your needs. The current free version of Lifesum is merely a sampler and no longer works for my needs.
691,691,4,2018-06-07T17:48:09.000Z,Freckle Perry,Keto Repeat entries,There are no Keto recipes in the program. My husband and I are both trying the Keto Genic diet. He eats different things than me but we eat the same stuff a lot of the time. I prepare the food and he enters the food items on both our phones in our logs. I wish we could just enter the food items one time and not have to re-enter entries. Though we’re glad that it remembers our recent entries. Now our phones need to connect.

I just wish we could still choose our own plan while using free but have to pay for access to recipes and other things in the plan. The app also doesn’t accurately track my step telling me I had 0 when my phone said I had 10,000. I wish we could connect it to other apps so it could be more accurate but otherwise great app"

That’s a feature I forgot to look for before I hit yes to sign up. Now I’m gonna have to look for another app that will do that ugh buyers remorse.
694,694,4,2019-01-07T03:53:03.000Z,Gouyhbdd,So far so good,"So far I like this a lot! Last year I used MFP which I love for all the food options and how good it was to save recipes. But this is visually appealing and helps me more with macros and other health goals. Hopefully as it expands more foods will be added. I also wish I could manually enter the number of categories burned from exercise, I have to play around with minutes/such until I get the right amount (or close enough)."
695,695,5,2019-03-08T15:58:45.000Z,YL143,Helping me lose weight,I really enjoy this app.  I needed something where I could put in my weight loss goal and it could tell me how many calories per day to consume in order to meet that goal.  It connects with other work out apps to keep track of calories burned that ways as well.  It’s exactly what I needed and so far I’ve lost 1 lb per day since I started using it.

I would upgrade to a Premium account ...but the calorie tracker links to data that’s not always clear or accurate (e.g. multiple options for a Coke - some correct, some wrong such as 140 calories for 0.4 ounces of coke?) App relies on users to report incorrect info but this user sourced approach does not seem to be working."

I cannot connect my fitbit to it without paying a subscription, which I dealt with, but I just updated it and now it closes itself out everytime I open the app, before even making it to the home screen. It is a great app if you do not want to use a Fitbit with it, but if you’re on a budget that is not feasible. They also should really do a better job ensuring that their updates are not going to ruin the app experience completely."

If this app had a more robust and dependable database of foods, the ability to enter in more foods with more specific measurements, and the ability to enter eaten servings by more specific measurements it would be perfect. Maybe I will check back in a year or so, but for now I’m sticking with clunky old MyFitnessPal. It’s ugly, but at least it is flexible and accurate."

First of all, you cannot put custom macros in this. It does their own calculation for you. Secondly, the way it calculates net carbs is different than any other app (and way) I have seen, and you cannot change it. The meal plan is ok. Food is good. BUT they had some food on there that was 7-10 net carbs. I cancelled it and downloaded Carb Manager instead. I’m mad that I bought someone that I’m not even going to use for 2.5 more months."

The only problem is that I have type one diabetes. And I have to take a certain amount of carbs a day.

707,707,1,2020-12-20T13:54:05.000Z,danielrnyc,Extremely unreliable food database,"The app is visually appealing and user friendly. But the food database is extremely is unreliable. Almost always, the database is different that what the label says on common packaged food. Many, many times the nutrition facts are correct, but the serving size is wrong. For example, the label on Organic Valley Cottage Cheese (4%) says 1/2 cup = 110 calories. But the Life Sum database says 1 cup = 110 calories. And, to make matters worse, there is an icon that says “Verified”. Clearly they are not verifying anything. Unless you are willing to manually enter your own nutrition facts for everything you eat, this app is pretty much unusable."

My one problem is that the calories on the app are usually never right when going to put food items in. Even the ones with a verified check mark are wrong 98% of the time. If this issue were to get fixed I would give it five stars. But for now 3 stars will do because one of the most important things about the app is constantly wrong.

In the response it say that they can’t cancel your subscription in order to do it you need to go thru what ever way you payed and cancel thru them. I don’t usually rate any things I buy but all the stuff that I need to do just to cancel (now mind you it was only to cancel, not even get a refund back) is not worth the app. It does not make any sense to me that they can’t cancel your subscription.

Uninstalled app. Useless if the calorie count add another 30% error to the errors we already get from processed and restaurant food.  This was while using it on the iPhone.  Then I checked the sync on the iPad app. It showed the correct calorie count. Looks like a bug. A big one. Also the iPad app does not go to landscape mode.

Lots of built in foods and the ability to custom add my own is a plus. I wish this ability to add custom items extended to exercises as well. I’d like the ability to create an exercise and routines with weights and reps completed including the option to add calories burned if they are not calculated properly through the app. I would like this app to continue sending all the info to the Apple Health Kit.

You also can’t adjust the servings. Example: peanut butter 1 serving = 2tbsp but the app was set at 1 serving =1 tbsp and there was no way to change it. Sure you could just change it from 1 serving to 2 but the very few nutrition facts that were actually right would double. It’s not accurate that way and will mess you up! I deleted and went with another app that’s all been accurate. Would try again if this was fixed.

It could be because it is newer and has less wrong input from the world. However, I have in just two days found calorie data that is incorrect.

However because of this issue, this is basically a calorie calculator (they have many of these available on the App Store that have imperial measuring system).

Maybe showing if you are on track for how much weight you have lost(or gained) each week so we know if we need to eat more or less. Also, it said that “Dave’s Killer Bread; Good seed” is unhealthy, but I don’t see why at all. I eat it everyday and it lowers my score because its “unhealthy”. But all in all, really good app"

Unfortunately, Lifesum doesn’t allow you to set your own eating times (for things like intermittent fasting) and ends up telling you that you’re bad for eating too much for lunch. I also can’t create my own recipe meals with a higher detail and I can’t input nutritional value. So, I’m sticking with Samsung Health until updates are made to fit multiple lifestyles"

They don’t tell you until you’ve already created an account and given them your information that nearly every feature of the app is locked behind a premium subscription pay-wall. The only thing that’s free is the food and calorie tracker. If that’s the only thing I wanted I would just use the basic health app that comes preloaded on my phone. I’m tired of things that pose as free and end up requiring premium plans and “in-app purchases” to access. We’ve officially reached the technological version of “nickel-and-dimed to death.”

My only complaint is not being able to add another snack and rename the labels in diary.  I’d like a spot for post work in the morning and an afternoon snack.  Currently snacks all have to be lumped together.  It’s not a big deal right now, but I’m amping up for a marathon.  I need to see food for preworkout/breakfast, postworkout/snack, lunch, snack, dinner, and pre bed recovery."
724,724,3,2020-12-23T16:22:07.000Z,GutsyHat,Pretty good,"I like the tracking system for food. Simple and easy to use. However I can’t change any of my notifications for when I need to log my food! Every change I make, I leave the app, come back, and they have all reverted to defaults."
725,725,2,2020-05-06T10:08:42.000Z,Lowblow99,Mostly ok,"Overall design is well conceived, but there are an unusual amount of errors when it comes to calculating calories, specifically with macros."

Daily updates and “scores” help keep me motivated and on track. However, I feel like several functions don’t work properly. I am unable to delete certain measurements and if I am able to, it does not save. It also does not upload my Fitbit data despite being connected and synced. As a premium member, I would love to see these fixed."

From the diet choices to the daily support with my exercise programs, this is the best app for the day to day support of my health. You can change your plan whenever you want.

729,729,4,2019-06-28T15:22:20.000Z,notatrumpster,Easy to use,"I really like how easy it is to use with one exception, it’s not always possible to edit the amounts of foods/calories.  You just have to pick something close. I like how it breaks down carbs, fats, and protein. I like the quiz which helps you pick the right diet for your lifestyle.  The connection to Fitbit needs a little work but after a few syncs the information pulls in.  It is much more encouraging than Weight Watcher’s app."
730,730,4,2018-02-24T02:26:09.000Z,Brittany Buchanio,Wish you could customize,"I really like this app, WAY better than 3 other macros tracking apps I’ve tried. I will say that my protein goal needs to be way higher than what his app allotted me and there’s no way to customize it. So I’m technically like 50g over my protein daily but i know that going into it. Still a bummer though."
731,731,2,2018-05-29T22:22:44.000Z,Stupidreviewingreqs,Don’t subscribe,"Very disappointed that there are all these diet choices to cater the app to but there are so few recipes to chose from. I’m trying to follow a ketogenic diet and am not losing weight. I upgraded hoping there would be more recipe choices to help keep me on track but there’s like maybe 10 recipes for each breakfast, lunch, and dinner and they’re not even appetizing or common foods. Vanilla cod tartare?  Very limited selection.  Atkins has a free app and actually has a decent recipe selection. The only positive is seeing the breakdown of the micronutrients for protein, fat and carbs."
732,732,4,2019-01-08T16:27:32.000Z,American in Paris9,Great in general; could use consistent serving size measures,"I’ve enjoyed using the app and generally have found it easy to use, but it would be great if each food item came with the same suite of measurements. Too many of the foods only allow for measurements by weight (ounces or grams), which aren’t intuitive or easy to know for all users. Adding cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons for everything would be really helpful."

This app keeps things appealing and so far has had all the food I’ve eaten so far.  I am dropping 1 star because it has been very pushy about the Keto diet.  I’ve gotten emails, taken the test (which does not give an option to choose if you’re a vegetarian) and it’s always the Keto diet."

However, fourth day comes, the app is no longer connecting with my iwatch to track the exercises. I can’t use your exercise tab on the app because it’s not accurate to my workouts. Please let me know what to do step by step! (Btw my iwatch is not even a year old it’s a 5.3 version)"

I enter my meals to the app on my phone, however it rarely syncs the information to my watch. For example- right now it reads the caloric input from breakfast. However I entered information from all of my courses. I want to purchase the upgrade however, I am unsure if this glitch will repeat itself during the upgrade as well."

Dissappointing, but they have to be paying health experts and healthy chefs in order for their work to appear on it. The little quizzes they offer are free though, so you can take your results and research what to do separately."

The only problem i’m currently having is that ever since the recent update i haven’t been able to log my water intake. To try and fix this i logged out, deleted the app, then redownloaded the app but now my email is invalid and when i try to make a new account any email i put in is now invalid."
738,738,4,2021-06-21T17:44:09.000Z,Cutler Lane,Love It!,"This is a great app and fits my needs almost perfectly. My only issue with it would be in the workout section. For some things (swimming, running, etc.) having it so you can set it for __ minutes is perfect. However, for things such as sit-ups, push-ups, etc. It would be better if you could enter how many you did, instead of how long you did it for."
739,739,1,2019-09-10T14:45:26.000Z,dsauceda3,Very unsatisfied,I bought the app on 8/26 and was quickly prompted to get the Premium upgrade. I unfortunately decided to do the year because it said $3.99 a month well it charged me the whole this.... 1st strike. Then I realized that I really didn’t need the extra stuff as there are support groups and Pinterest for Keto recipes and decided to unsubscribe from the Premium before the 14 days were up. I have reached out on the App several times and no response I have emailed only to get an automated letter saying they will get back to me. Beware don’t do the Premium Upgrade you can find the recipes free on Pinterest

The only thing that’s making this not a five star review is the fact that finding the right foods is a little bit tricky in the search menu option. I haven’t really used the photo capturing method, but I’ll give that a try and give another review. So far so good, I’ve lost 5 pounds in one week!! yay!!!"
741,741,4,2019-01-05T22:04:48.000Z,JGILMORE790,Solid.,"Good app, visually very nice. Obviously a competitor to MFP. A couple things, aside from the library that I’m sure LifeSum is working on, that MFP has over this app is the ability to manually add protein carbs and fat. Currently LifeSum allows adding only calories. Also, the Apple Watch compatibility, MFP allows adding calories/water consumption via the watch, which LifeSum does not. Overall, good. I’ll keep trying it out until I find one to stick with."

I’d love if there was a diet catered to that, since I’m finding it hard to reach my 2,000 calorie goal/day. I’m sure this feature would be useful to many other people who are either on this diet temporarily (like me) or long-term."

I emailed about it and they needed all this info from me and it wasn’t fixed. Also my recents are never available for each meal it’s only the ones I had for that specific meal. And sometimes my recent food is not available at all and I have to scan it again or find it again. Last but not least I have to go back one step every time I want to change the amount of servings of the food.

However... recently the app will randomly kick me out so I have to log in multiple time. Finally after logging in five times in a row, I just deleted the app. Hopefully that “bug” will be fixed."

When I set my calorie intake to be 1800, I want it to stay there, no matter what my workout is versus increase calorie intake! It is so frustrating!!  Is that only an option on the premium version? If so, I am considering other apps that hold the calories once set versus having to remember daily to input food for the day BEFORE I workout, else it is going to change."

Wrong. I’m not finding it very accurate when it comes to nutrition labels, many foods aren’t even stored in the app unless they have a barcode, and it seems like people add things in but have many typos so it makes it difficult to find the right foods. I really wanted this app to be my go-to, especially for the price, but I may be going back to my old tracking app."

Please fix whatever problem caused this. It took me only 4 days to gain 4 pounds and now imagine how long it will take me to lose those 4 pounds and get back on track?? A very long time and I am very disappointed right now. Please fix this. I don’t want anyone to go through the same thing as I did.

It is by far my favorite tracking app, however, I’ve recently switched back to another app. I do a lot of my own cooking, using recipes from internet sites. The other app makes the input of recipe data much more simple and less time consuming then Lifesum. I was spending too much time putting in every ingredient to get an accurate count. If Lifesum ever gets this feature I’ll definitely be back!"

On the screen, it said I could buy a 12 month subscription by paying about $3.50 a month. That would be fine with me, $3.50 is no big deal. I could easily take a small amount from a part-time job paycheck. I look at my bank statement later today and it says that it billed me THE WHOLE $44 ALL AT ONCE! What the hell??? So now I have no way of getting my money back and have to pull from my savings just for a stupid app."

With MyFitnessPal, I can share those sorts of things on Facebook, and several apps I use also syncs with my friends list to show me who else is already using them...but not lifesum.

I am very upset and disappointed because this seemed like such a great app to become more healthier but I can’t even use it anymore. Please respond quick because you will be continuing to bill me for three months and I know I cannot cancel it so I would like to know what is going on so I can continue to use this app.

Including the supposed Black Friday sale. That’s the same sale they have every month. Black Friday sales are supposed to be enticing. I’d love to try premium, but I’m not really interested in the price tag they’ve got. I’ll stick to the basic option. My Apple health app lets me manually enter in the info this app won’t track without me paying for it."

Had used ww for years love this app too. I wish you could manually adjust your calorie goal and also if u track something at wrong time just hold on it and change from breakfast to lunch without deleting and then rewriting. But that is minor. There are a few apps less expensive but On the whole I like this app!!

It’s also great how it’ll sync to other health apps on your phone / watch. Inputting food is also easy, whether it’s already in the system or something new! I just wish you were able to use other meal plans besides the classic without paying for premium. I’d like to be able to adjust my macros!"

This would be the best app if you can save custom meals with all the nutrition information, not just calories. Their food choices are are very limited and it can make it hard to track all of your meals. Hope they fix it."

Would love to see caffeine tracking added and an expansion to the food catalog. Also would love to understand what the little green guy is doing on the watch. Doesn’t seem to be consistent with my food and water consumption, so would love to understand how to make use of it."

I’m not sure if it’s because my phone is newer, but it just seems to be super buggy and crashes and freezes a lot. It’s to the point where I can’t even use it. It’s also not tracking my calories burned and my eaten calories stay the same (it doesn’t update when I add food to the day) so I’m still having to manually track a lot. Kinda defeats the purpose of having an app."

But over time I have noticed that some things are not accurate. Like serving sizes for different foods and the calories in those foods. I ate some Waffles by Kodiak cakes this morning and went to enter the calorie information and found that on the box the calories say 250 however the app tells me 230.

Also the portions on like a raw onion you don’t get to put in your  portion only the few options they give u and I don’t have a scale and u better know fraction decimal conversions if you want to put in your portion.

While the app interface is nice on my mobile devices, without a synchronized desktop app the program just doesn’t work for me.

However, it rates your food choices with smiley faces and frowny faces...I eat very healthy, I just wanted this app to help keep track of protein intake. I entered a banana as a snack and it showed me a frowny face...so now bananas are bad for you!?? When I clicked on the face to get more information as to why it is labeled with a frown face, ofcourse it says you have to upgrade to premium. It’s EXTREMELY LIMITED if you don’t pay for the premium. Disappointed. Don’t need an app telling me I shouldn’t eat a banana. Going back to LoseIt app."

I've heard many good things about this app and I'm have really"
782,782,4,2020-07-19T09:19:57.000Z,that one orginal,No cal count,Even though it is a counter I like this app because it helps make it easy for me to log in my food every time I eat and is more of a food journal also the people help and give you some good advice and is very nice on this app too. I had this a few years ago and now I’m decided it’s best to just keep it on my phone so I can stay in track of my goals.  Go forth and wander. ✌️
783,783,2,2021-05-12T12:31:12.000Z,Relhon1,Ok so far but needs improvement,"I just got done with support and was told the app cannot log exercise correctly that’s imported from partner apps. That’s a pretty big issue for a weight loss app. I have to manually log each exercise even though the information is being imported. Also, the nutrition information for several foods I’ve scanned for meals is highly inaccurate according to the label on the food. I won’t be renewing my premium subscription if these issues aren’t fixed by then."
784,784,3,2020-11-10T02:25:03.000Z,Hawaii123211,Great app but...,"This app is absolutely amazing and I love the easy way to use it. Sometimes it hard to find the exact food that I am eating but that is fine. My one complaint is that, I know that you need to make money but, there is an option for “how to make this meal healthier” and that is the one thing that I think should be free because without this the app doesn’t really help you with losing weight, because it doesn’t tell you how."
785,785,4,2020-05-14T13:51:04.000Z,Contest buddy,Love this app,This app is great. I love the habit trackers for things like fruit and fish. I just wish we could set meal frequency (6small meals rather than 3 and a snack) and the weight tracking goes back to your starting weight every time you don’t enter your current rate. Would love to see that addressed. Other than that I love this app. It is motivating without leaving me with a guilt trip when I forget to do something.
786,786,4,2020-05-09T21:32:28.000Z,Hm102690,Super simple way to track meal habits!,"Love how easy the app is to track daily nutrient intake, especially with the built in barcode reader! The recipes are also tasty and made with ingredients that that I am already familiar cooking with."
787,787,3,2020-04-09T20:36:29.000Z,xtox_cameron,Great but needs a few adjustments.,I like the way the app is set up it’s really cool and I haven’t seen a calorie counter quite like this one. But I am concerned for the users of this app. This app is very popular among young people suffering with eating disorders and anorexia. It is very easy to use this app for the purposes of starving yourself. It would be great to see a diet option for eating disorder recovery available on the app considering so many people use this app to track their eating disorders.
788,788,3,2020-03-30T11:16:38.000Z,lauracrans,New to the app,"Just downloaded this app today and was super excited about the grocery list planning! But when I chose my meal plan and swapped a couple meals, it would still add the old meal’s ingredients on the grocery list. So even though I chose veggie omelets for breakfast, it would add chia seeds and bananas and coconut flakes to my grocery list when I clicked the add button on the omelet... I really hope this can get fixed soon ☹️ if it gets fixed, this app would be great!"

For example running 6mph for 30 mins does not burn 500. It’s 300 at most. Or climbing for an “hour” which the climber is not excepting full force during the full hour will not burn 1000 calories."
790,790,4,2017-12-18T23:35:22.000Z,Laaaanj,I love lifesum!!!,Lifesum is so versatile. Every app I’ve tried using is strictly for weight loss & there’s such a minority of small-framed people looking to gain weight and Lifesum has this option! It tells me how many calories I need to eat for each meal as well as in a day. So far I’ve gained five pounds & counting since my fitness journey :)
791,791,2,2018-02-04T03:12:20.000Z,Pugmite,Terrible Food Data Base,"I bought this subscription because I loved the format and layout of the app way better than others I have seen before. But after buying the subscription I’ve noticed that the food data base is very flawed. There is limited food options listed, and often it will not pull up options for simple searches such as “egg” or salad. In addition, there is little to none data of any sort of fast food. So overall I’m pretty disappointed since I payed for it."
792,792,3,2019-01-05T01:18:46.000Z,Lucas123xewp,Food database is too small,"I like this app but the database is too small. I like how it keeps track of my calories, fat, protein, etc but when I try to add food items they aren’t always there. Also, if they are in the database, the portion doesn’t match and you can’t change it. I’ve used other diet apps in the past that had a much larger food database. I think if the food choices and portions were altered it would get a higher rating."

794,794,3,2019-01-25T20:25:24.000Z,redbait,Promising but buggy,"Overall great app for keeping a food diary, good database of food although relying on customers to input nutritional data leads to lots of inaccuracies. The biggest downfall is the lack of consistent syncing with Apple HealthKit in both directions and must be fixed to make this a top-rate app. Tips and game-ification aspects are pretty tired in 2019, but you can turn them all off. Personally less interested in their diet plans and recipes so I can’t comment on those."
795,795,3,2019-01-30T20:51:04.000Z,Zizzlex,"UI is awesome, nutrition tracking is not",I’ve found that some of the barcodes scanned don’t show the accurate nutrition information.

This app is SO user friendly and has the largest database of foods I’ve seen yet (for the daily diary). It’s extremely detailed, informative, and versatile. I like how you can track everything from water intake to exercise. It’s also quite visually appealing!"
797,797,1,2019-07-21T17:11:46.000Z,Mrufka,Premium is simply big disappointment,"It seems very promising from non premium look but once you get the premium it’s not what you are expecting it to be! Not all meal plans have the “shopping list” option (only about 10%) and their meal preparation instructions are super simple, most of the time it is just 2 sentence instructions 🤣 you might as well just write nothing. I wish they let you try it for a day to see what you are signing up for. And it was featured in “app of the day” ?! It should be on top list of worst premium apps! They need to change a lot."

The food database is leagues above what else is currently out there. But best of all are the diets and meal plans — they make it super easy to test out different ways of eating. Also, love the iPhone widgets. Simple and helpful, that’s all I want for a nutritional app."
799,799,3,2020-10-21T04:22:34.000Z,MikedubII,Pretty but less functional than it should be,"App looks nice, but doesn’t write to Health and you can’t export. Competitor apps do. Widget is nice but I assume that other apps will catch up to that. In their FAQ there is a question of how to share data with healthcare professional, and their answer is to “give them your log in info, then change ASAP.”"
800,800,2,2018-02-28T22:23:18.000Z,RyScoAn,Wanted to use,"It was starting to grow on me, after switch from my fitness pal, however to the best of my knowledge you can build recipes/meal and that’s a deal breaker. I don’t want to input every food item separately when I eat the meal frequently, or calculate a portion of a recipe I cook for my family. For me, being able to do so really gives me a better understanding of what I can and can’t eat, while tweaking the recipe to fit my needs. Hope this can be added some day, I’ll probably be back if it is."
801,801,3,2018-05-01T11:34:07.000Z,imnottryinganothernickname,Helpful but limited,I like how easy it is to plug in calories and exercise - extensive data list. I’ve not found anything not in there in the 2 weeks I’ve used it. However it keeps pushing to buy the upgraded version. App should give a sample of what the upgrade offers. I’m curious to know what the different smiley faces mean but enough for that price. So the smiley faces are ignored. I am disappointed the recipes aren’t really available on the free app either.
802,802,5,2018-07-13T14:26:56.000Z,LydiaG123,I love this app!,This app has been so helpful for me to track my calories and eat the right amount of foods! It also helps me to get my exercise in and can connect to your healthy app if you have an iPhone and can track the amount of calories you burn by walking or exerting when you have your phone with you!
803,803,3,2018-11-04T22:09:59.000Z,Rmf703,Not the greatest but okay,"I like the fact that I can track my meals and it gives some recipes but I think it would be better if there was a meal planner and shopping list included. Could that be added? In fact, I bought the app thinking they were included bc the pictures include a shopping list pic but I can’t find it. Thanks. Will continue to use the app for my year membership but after that year, we’ll see."

I like to intensify my workout on the treadmill to burn more calories. What it says on the treadmill vs the app are totally different. And also crunches. You should be able to record how many you did. Not go by how many minutes. Please fix this."

I have been staying on track and have loved it. However, today I have been unable to add any meals. I have tried deleting and re-downloading the app, I even had to delete all of the progress that I have made so far. It is very frustrating and it doesn’t help that there is nobody to call or get in immediate contact with. Very frustrating. Although I really enjoy the app, the customer service needs work along with the technical issues."

They said if I got the premium it would be like 12-14 a month, I thought it wasn’t a bad deal until it charged my account over 50 dollars when it said the charge was monthly. I tried to delete it and receive a refund but the app is awful to navigate if you want to actually delete your account. On top of that it said I had to get rid of my subscription before I deleted my account and they gave me no information on how to do it. Overall this app is something that you shouldn’t get."
807,807,1,2020-02-03T12:50:28.000Z,bluemelmichael,Do NOT get Premium,I think this app is visually appealing and it makes me want to use it. So much so that I purchased 1 year of premium.

I love that Lifesum has recommended recipes but when I go to actually make them the recipe instructions are usually confusing or lacking information. Would also be great if you could see recipes from other diet plans without having to switch your plan."

I like the food plans it has an an option, it has synced to my Fitbit, and has been user friendly. I'm excited to see how this plays out. I'm always a skeptic, but off to a great start!"
811,811,3,2018-06-06T11:42:47.000Z,ls usernickname,Database is lacking,"I switched from MyFitnessPal to Lifesum so I could follow a keto diet plan more specifically and see my macros more easily. Layout and aesthetics of this app are great. But the database is seriously lacking compared to MyFitnessPal, which makes tracking a hassle. Even creating your own recipe is a lot of work bc of the small and sometimes in accurate database. It would be nice if things you logged as one meal would auto populate for other meals as well."

My problem is when it tells you to take a pic of your food, it's almost always wrong and they only give you a few options of what they think it is. You can't take a pic and say what it is. So I end up putting each ingredient in one by one and it gets a little annoying. I like the day ratings and the little advice they give. Overall it's a good app!"
813,813,3,2019-03-25T04:57:31.000Z,Cyn719,Easy to use but has some bugs,This app is easy to use but I have been having some issues. For example I selected a food and it said “5 calories” per serving.  This seemed off but I continued using the calories I knew I had eaten.  Upon leaving a renter if the app my calories were way off and it when I went to edit the food the calories per serving was 350.  I have to close the app and restart it and the verify my entries every time.

It is very easy to use and makes calorie tracking very convenient. That being said, the weekly statistics of the calorie intake never matched up with the 1-month or 3-month view. Worse, all of a sudden my history of the calorie intake got corrupted with some meals missing now and other meals shifted to random days. In other words, the whole history has become useless."
816,816,1,2021-04-22T13:13:35.000Z,Fellfell,Don’t waste your money,"This app could use a lot of work. The nutrition information isn’t always accurate when you try to log items by scanning barcodes. The app constantly glitches and disconnects from my Fitbit, so my exercise calories are rarely correct. It usually takes me 4-5 tries to get the app to show the correct information. You also have limited access to features if you don’t buy the premium version. Which is a waste of money due to all the glitching. Sure it looks cute, but myfitnesspal is a better app."

Along with eating healthier includes not eating out as much. Home made meals are near IMPOSSIBLE to track with this app unless you want to take out a ruler and measure each noodle of spaghetti you eat. I feel like this app is more tailored towards people trying to get in shape and have a healthier diet, because to a lot of people a healthy diet is one you cannot simply buy at the store."

Compared to MyFitnessPal, the search option to find foods is awful.  When searching for a food item, your list is littered with nonrelevant or incorrectly entered items by other users.  There is also no option to find only verified items which is disappointing.  will be switching bad to MFP until Lifesum improves."

The free pay off the app only had the one plan, Classic Dieting. However,it didn't let you customize it and you are locked into the calories and macros it sets for you. I don't follow those guidelines and would need to change the macros to what I do try to follow but couldn't find any way to do that.

It’s not in my subscriptions on iTunes. Not only I have to contact multiple parties to cancel I can’t even do it manually because I did and they still charged me. Just don’t do it.

If I have a meal planning system or a recipe, I don’t want to enter each ingredient of the recipe, I just want to enter the calories and macros."
841,841,5,2018-07-22T04:18:33.000Z,Okay wait,Awesome app (one suggestion),"This app is great and I love all the features only thing I would suggest is that on the app icon the ring around the “L” should move as you fill up your calories for the day, kinda like how the hands on the clock app move. I think it’d be a cool detail and it’d mean I don’t have to open the app to see where my calorie intake is"
842,842,5,2020-05-08T17:46:14.000Z,Armando_v94,Lost 10lb in 1 month,I followed the keto diet plan on the app and lost 10 lbs in 1 month. This app really helps! Having a diet plan the whole time and giving you step by step cooking instructions made this diet effortless! The meals are all tasty and simple to follow. I highly recommend doing any of the diet plans from this app and using it amazing features!
843,843,1,2021-02-09T19:30:42.000Z,threeedgedsword,garbage,"This app doesn’t deserve a single star. MyFitnessPal’s free version is way better than this garbage. Lifesum doesn’t update your weight when you update it on apple health. There’s no way to customize your food diary meals setting (I like whole day instead of worrying about each meal and ONE snack) or customize the micronutrients. Why did I pay for this again?! The premium for MyFitnessPal allows you to customize so much more, even MyFitnessPal’s free version is more customizable. I want a refund. I used this app for a total of maybe four days. I hate the UI."
844,844,3,2021-01-04T18:16:35.000Z,Crousifier,Why can’t you plan and make grocery list with classic,One of my favorite functions of the app is that it can create a grocery list based on the recipes you like for you..... however this is unavailable for the classic plan - which is the only plan that shows all the recipes. Please make a plan that allows all recipes to be used and you can make grocery list of everything you need for those.

Recently though, I’ve had trouble with the calories updating needlessly though. I’m supposed to be a certain deficit, I try entering another plan and suddenly my deficit changes wildly, and hasn’t changed back even though i switched back my plan. Very infuriating."

The only issue (and it’s major) is that I don’t have the premium version of the app, so I can’t access what feels like 80% of the functionality of this app. I wish that you could buy certain parts of it, such as the day rating, without shelling out $50 a year. Otherwise, Lifesum is clean, functional, and helpful!"

My biggest and really only complaint is that the foods are inaccurate!! Like very very wrong! I would have to enter all the specs from every food myself for the accuracies which honestly defeats the purpose of entering! I have used my fitness pal for years and it was WAYY more reliable. Unfortunately it doesn’t pair with my Apple Watch, but I would take accuracy over luxury any day for my health!! I want a refund for this. Waste of money for premium."
855,855,3,2019-02-23T19:44:57.000Z,sarbear10101,Frustrating as a MFP user,Using this app after being spoiled by MFP is frustrating.  If you frequently record the same food unless it’s an every day thing you have to search and search for the food again.  The way the serving sizes are displayed are also confusing although I’m not sure how to explain it.

My main complaint or suggestion would be to add a setting for those who are currently pregnant (or breastfeeding). In that situation, tracking your meals is still be hugely important, but your goals, acceptable weight, and intake of certain things will naturally be different."

The past week or so my app has been glitching and resetting my weight to my starting weight every day ...so I am unable to track my weight loss. There have also been a few times where I enter my meals and they do not save. Other than this I really love the app....I just wish I could consistently track my weight loss.

I have a water bottle that is 20 oz so idk like to add 20 oz at a time but it’s not allowed. So my water intake is off on the app. You can also scan the barcode of your foods and so far everything I’ve scanned has the wrong nutritional facts! It’s so useless. And you can’t edit them. I hate that I paid for the year subscription, wish I could get my money back. There are more useful and accurate apps out there. Don’t waste your money here."

When food is scanned in or even put in manually the macros are way off. For some not all of the foods scanned in. So it’s hard to track everything consumed that day. I do like that you can set your macro preferences and keep track of water consumption. Although I do with it would let you manually input the oz of water drank."

However, I have noticed on several occasions that my exercise is automatically tracked and imported from the Apple Health app but then disappears when I reopen the Lifesum app. This causes my calories burned and left to be inaccuywhich is one of the main reasons I downloaded the app so I unfortunately will no longer be using this product."

The serving size of “verified my Lifesum” items are almost always incorrect along with the listed macros. Otherwise, this app is pretty cool for monitoring progress. I just wish they would either fix these discrepancies or allow more freedom when manually entering food items."

I’ve always used MyFitnessPal and wanted to try something that grades good, but, I was having difficulties inserting my meals also I choose an affordable payment plan for me but then ended up not even a month later getting charged for a whole year subscription, which has really set me back, when I never chose that option. I see no way of getting my money back and I had already went right back to using MyFitnessPal. It was a lose lose situation."

My own complaint is it has a limited number of body measurements that can be added, and there’s no way to remove or edit the added measurements once you’ve hit save. Fix that and this app would get five stars for sure!"

I wish. 160 calories for a whole cup of roasted pumpkin seeds? No. Someone needs to really fix this information - isn’t this a large part of the value of the app? And those were “verified” listings! I bought a 6 month subscription but I’m seriously considering canceling it until this issue is fixed.

I upgraded, it said 5.99 a month I think for six months. I got access to plans like keto things, which I wasn’t interested in the diet plans they have and more diagnostics for your fat,  calories, etc and it wasn’t worth it. Then I tried to cancel my subscription and it charged me the full amount that would have been charged in six months."

At the end of the day, my calories were off by more than 200. Some days it said I burned more than what my watch and phone said, other days it said I burned less. Aside from that, I REALLY like this app and hope that this issue is resolved soon!"

I found the food I wanted to add when searching, but it didn't have the right number of calories. So I decided to manually input my food instead. But it only let me put in the calories and nothing else, so I'm on track for my calorie count for the day, but all the other nutrients are lacking. It also won't let me go back and edit or delete anything, so I'm stuck with the mistakes."
893,893,5,2018-05-28T17:14:24.000Z,Vin a libre,Great app but at a cost,This is a great app but really buying the premium package is the best option.

I have no clue what’s going on but we’re not getting off to a good start. I’ve emailed the company but I got a response back that they have a high volume of emails so who knows when they’ll get back to me. I’m so disappointed.

899,899,1,2019-02-07T18:15:02.000Z,LookAtACellBioTextbook,This app recommends STARVATION,"Hi, prospective doctor here. For people attempting to lose weight, this app recommends you undergo “two days of fasting” or the keto diet. Both of these options cut out sugar which is necessary for glycolysis, the metabolic pathway that fuels your body and synthesizes the ATP and Pyruvate that is used for Pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. All these processes keep your body alive and functioning. Eliminating glucose long term will lead to muscle deterioration and in severe cases, keto acidosis or self-canibalisation. Both are LIFE THREATENING. I suggest seeking a nutritionist who knows the bodily processes and not a trendy app that favors body image above health."

I did not want to renew my subscription, because the functions of a paid application are not worth the money. I wanted to cancel my subscription a couple of days before the end, but I was withdrawn on January 14th! In customer support, they was answered that this is not their concern and need to contact the app store. So I do not advise using the paid version."

904,904,3,2021-01-15T06:03:36.000Z,LuMc19,Beautiful app but could be better,"I love that i can track fruit and veggies. However , since I enter those in the log I think the fruit and veggie trackers could be automatically updated."
905,905,5,2020-12-26T15:07:48.000Z,DonikaDonna,"No doubt, THE BEST","I wish I could start using this app when I first installed 2 years ago. This app is the best, I've lost weight, and my sister also. I reccomend to all my friends, family. Calories intakes, water intakes, daily steps. wow!"
906,906,3,2021-01-04T22:34:32.000Z,ildmangreefg,Not worth premium,"I love the calorie counter portion and all the tracking! I paid for the premium for 12 months for the meal plans and recipes, but I am so disappointed. The recipes aren’t awful, but there is very few that I would eat. Many of them are vegetarian (which is great), but I wish there were more options for normal, easy and healthy meals. I would totally give the app 5 stars if there were more recipes!"
907,907,3,2020-09-28T13:29:01.000Z,jhawk8121,App is fine,The app does what it tells you but theres a SUPER annoying part about it that keeps me from using it more often. For some reason if I’m on the previous day and try to log stuff it will automatically put that log in for the day of instead of the day before. Its a huge inconvenience because you’ll fill in a full meal just to have it show up in the day after.
908,908,3,2020-04-03T08:19:12.000Z,herroimseto,Some potential frustrations,I just started using Lifesum. One of the first things I noticed was that i could not input the specific amount of water I drink. Personally I drink from a 40oz hydroflask and I would like an option to click 40oz of water vs clicking 8oz or 16oz multiple times.
909,909,3,2019-06-29T02:17:33.000Z,jellyromero,Why can’t people customize their macros?,"The app is nice; the only thing I can really complain about is how there is no option to customize our macros. Everyone’s different and everyone’s body requires different macros according to their goal. There should be options where you can create your own goals for fat, carbs, proteins, and calories for the day. I don’t like that I have to have the options set for me"
910,910,5,2018-02-02T23:34:02.000Z,Yassinperspective,A big feature missing to help making this App Perfect!,I have a huge problem adding my food to the diary after 12:00AM the target resets itself to the new day while this should be optional (when to start or finish the day) according to the different timezones and cultures. Much appreciated. Thank you!
911,911,5,2020-05-21T00:59:40.000Z,Tori3535,I LOST 10 POUNDS IN UNDER A MONTH!!,"I love this app, and I don’t even have premium! I lost 10 pounds! (including walking, workouts and more like that) but this app really helped me!! It tells me when I should eat more, less and reminds me to drink water when I need it!! I love this app and will keep on using it even after I reach my goal!!❤️"
912,912,3,2021-02-11T04:00:57.000Z,midnitebluez,Frustrated,"I paid for a year of premium and have stuck with it; it’s a beautiful app and does have many pluses.  The issues I have are: you can’t edit any of your saved meals and the calorie count is often wrong, making it kind of pointless.  It’s very rigid and not customizable enough which is discouraging. When I reached out to support in the app, my question went unanswered. Not horrible but not great."
913,913,5,2020-05-19T15:34:58.000Z,misterpeeisme,Normal person recipes that are easy & delicious,I love this app!  I have used many other apps thru the years and am so glad I found Lifesum!  It makes tracking so so easy and intuitive. And the recipes are for actual normal people vs needing random special ingredients that nobody has on hand!  5 stars all the way!
914,914,5,2020-02-27T18:03:51.000Z,bosslady2.0,"Effective, interactive, foodie approved",Loving the app and its many functions! Simple to use and interactive make it more enjoyable to log
915,915,4,2020-03-11T23:00:19.000Z,Bduce4355558,Decent App,Love how easy this app is to use. But it doesn’t save things. If I change how much food I ate. It doesn’t save. If I update my weight. It doesn’t always save. Super annoying. I wish there were more recipes and a way you can add your own recipes. Or import them. For as much money as I paid up front I wish it was a little more user friendly.
916,916,5,2020-02-04T02:34:37.000Z,RoundMan45,My only request,I’ve been using the premium version of this app for a while now. I love everything about—however it is stressful getting some barcodes to finally scan. The biggest thing I ask is for Lifesum to have a way to count calories and macros from homemade meals.
917,917,3,2019-09-20T11:26:45.000Z,RisaMHonda,🛑,"I just got this app yesterday and I’ve liked it so far, but opened it today to track my stuff and a pop up for 30% off keeps popping up even after I closed it, it’s every second I barley can even get a chance to track anything it’s plain out annoying I get it you have a 30% off going on right now stop telling me every second no sooner I hit the close button."
918,918,1,2020-01-10T08:46:42.000Z,allofyournicknamesaretaken,Great idea but horrible customer service,"I downloaded this app and paid for premium. It worked great for a bout 10 hrs and then all of a sudden I didn’t have premium anymore. I have reached out on multiple platforms, and it has been a week and no one has responded. It’s a shame because this app was just what I was looking for. $50 down the drain and apple keeps telling me to contact the app provider for a refund... YET THEY DO NOT RESPOND. I have contacted the Lifesum customer support and it’s all just automated responses. What a joke. Thanks for nothing."
919,919,2,2019-10-16T15:13:38.000Z,berglas612,App thinks I’m lying about my weight,"Just downloaded this app and it won’t even let me put in my weight of 75lbs. I’m pretty underweight, but this is a calorie tracker, right? Shouldn’t you expect people to be coming to the app with drastically low or high weights that want to change that?"
920,920,4,2018-01-05T02:08:23.000Z,CastleCatsGirl,A Problem...,"When I want to change my profile picture, it will start to glitch and log me off of the app. It gets me a little upset. Could you please fix this bug? Thank you. I got a little frustrated with it, so I'm calming down. Once again, if you could fix this as soon as possible, that would be very helpful."
921,921,2,2018-06-04T16:15:10.000Z,Emagine_1974,Ok app could be better,I paid for this app to go full on keto strict since it had the settings. What I can not stand is it has a section to add calories in keto. I am tracking carbs. You can key in long recipes if you have time and have it broken down per serving. Who wants to always key in recipes? Not everyone eats barcode items all the time. Please add a function to add carbs to your items for those of us who cook from scratch or follow meal plans. Please make this more keto friendly.
922,922,1,2018-10-13T02:06:29.000Z,devynleon,Hate.,"I have requested to have this removed shortly after signing up, no more than a week. I have yet to hear from the developer or anyone else for that matter. I figured out how to remove subscriptions through my settings however it will not allow me to remove this one. I am not happy and I do not want to pay for an app that did not work for me. Nobody just has $44 laying around when going to college full-time. I really wish that there was a trial that I could have signed up for to get a feel of the app."
923,923,2,2019-02-05T17:43:38.000Z,AngLeena,App is great but not worth buying premium version,"I have used this app for a while, on and off. I liked it, easy to navigate and track your food. I figured I would upgrade to premium and get even more features, but they weren’t all that great. I paid for the full year, tried to contact their customer service via their website and just getting kicked out. I think the free version is 5 stars, but paying for it just wasn’t worth it."
924,924,3,2019-02-16T18:35:43.000Z,coachleahco,Was better before...,"I used to recommend this app to my clients all the time and I would use it a lot too, and now you have to go to Premium to do a lot of the features you could do before. You used to be able to adjust your macros and now you have to pay. I won’t be able to use this anymore since mine are changing. Otherwise it’s a nice looking and easy app to use."

Then day 2 came around and my goal weight changed from 185lbs to 0lbs, which is screwing up everything. I can’t even go into my profile and change my goal weight because it glitches and won’t let me click next. Fix this please. I was considering purchasing a plan, but not if the app is gonna be as trash as this. Disappointing."
926,926,5,2020-10-02T17:00:37.000Z,freshnisar,Great app to track everything,I use this app and I’m so glad because it honestly reminds me to log my calorie in take and it’s easier to look for the food just by scanning the barcode or typing it in I’m am making progress with my weight loos and with the help of this app too!
927,927,2,2019-08-05T02:12:37.000Z,Arazonan,Looks nice but wrong info and mostly useless,Food nutrition info is wrong for most foods I  scan. Doesn’t integrate much or at all with apple health. Diet plans are sparse and don’t include popular options. Doesn’t give detailed nutritional information on food beyond (usually wrong) Carbs/Fat/Cals/Sodium and Potasium. I should have saved my money and used a spreadsheet. I could do better myself in Excel in 4-5 hours. I seriously can’t believe they charge $9.99 a month for this.  This is a total rip off.
928,928,5,2020-09-08T21:16:49.000Z,fridarpb,We love it!!,"My husband and I are premium members and love how easy this app makes counting calories, tracking them and adding them to our “my diary”."
929,929,4,2020-05-23T11:29:49.000Z,Colman45,Good app but it glitches,"After buying the subscription the app was working great, but now it is messing up my weight inputs. Two days in a row it has put me back to my starting weight. Yesterday’s weight data is just completely gone. I wish it would let me edit weight data because now it looks like I lost 7 pounds in one day!"
930,930,4,2018-12-03T01:49:25.000Z,Jbhchi,Mostly great,The features are good (with premium) and the app is easy to use. Would be nice to be able to see macros per meal so if I'm short or over for the day I could see which meal needs to be adjusted. Also would be nice to be able to quickly move a food item from one meal to another when viewing it in the diary.
931,931,4,2019-02-06T22:12:26.000Z,kasey.l.kb,Pretty thorough,"This is the most user friendly app I’ve found for fitness so far. The only thing that it’s missing is ‘exercise ball’ under the fitness tracker. Most of my workouts involve a ball of some sort, whether it’s the weight or stability ball. That would be an excellent addition to be able to track and would make he app flawless."
932,932,1,2019-03-08T15:09:08.000Z,Licie10,Horrible App!,"Please do not use this app to track your nutrition for weight loss. First do not get the premium, total waste of money and if you pay for more than one month to get the discount they off and you want to cancel the 3 month subscription after one month you don’t get your money back for the remaining two months. Then you can’t adjust your calories and macros to what you want if have to keep them to whatever meal plan you selected. The meal plans do not have any variety and are never updated."
933,933,4,2019-03-29T20:42:01.000Z,elisabeth808,One problem!,"I love this app but the default number of calories for me in a day is definitely more than I need, but when I tried to change it in the settings, it doesn’t work. I’ll type in a new number of calories, tap save changes, and then it doesn’t actually change it. Other than that great!"
934,934,5,2020-03-18T05:06:13.000Z,daniellllllldandan,This app WORKS!,"I love this app so much. Now, I am not obese or overweight or anything of the sort. I am an average size, however I really wanted to tone my legs and just lose a few extra pounds. This app helped me do that. You tell it your fitness goals and it tells you all the information you need about your diet."
935,935,5,2020-02-24T11:33:30.000Z,Traveling DO,Well done! Visually appealing and works well for Keto Strict!,"This app is great, and would be even better with a daily intermittent fasting plan (I do OMAD, or one meal a day). Of course, I can use this app easily by only entering data for one meal, and maybe that’s enough. Is it silly that I want my meal to have a green smiley face as well as my day?"
936,936,4,2019-08-15T13:40:49.000Z,Joseph5598,Great app!,"I love this app so far it has been great for letting me track what I eat and teller me how I could have improved it! I do hope that in the future you add a functionality to the Apple Watch to be able to add how much water I’m drinking, because it’s a lot easier to just tap my watch than to pull out my phone, especially when I’m at work."
937,937,2,2019-11-28T17:47:30.000Z,cablegonewrg,Nutrition & Calorie Information is 90% inaccurate,"Just a heads up this has a great format, the different diet plans are great BUT the nutritional information is horribly incorrect. You can scan Sara Lee 45 calorie bread, pretty clear how many calories, right? Not on Lifesum and this is the norm. Once I started tracking with another App I discovered how bad the info is on Lifesum and alerted them, including examples. It’s too bad as I really did like the layout. Just not willing to use multiple source tracking..."
938,938,3,2019-10-24T19:55:25.000Z,jocelyn524,Good overall frustrating nutritional inputting,I do love this app but I find the nutritional info to be very inconsistent. Sometimes I will look up an item and it will have different nutritional info regardless of serving size and preparation method - just the raw item itself. I only find the nutritional info to be accurate when I scan the barcode. Also I find it difficult to input a complete meal that isn’t in the vault.
939,939,2,2019-07-14T13:26:03.000Z,Sheoftensaid,Only good if you pay for premium,"This app used to be a decent free app, but it is now useless unless you pay to upgrade. I paid for a year subscription but didn’t stick with using it enough to pay for a second year. Since the last time I used it as a free app, they have significantly reduced the available features to non subscribers. If you will use it daily, it’s worth the $45/yr. otherwise, there are many better free options out there."
940,940,3,2017-11-05T15:14:19.000Z,8303772350,Share meals and recipes,"Decent app, needs a better food database.  Would be great if you could share meals/recipes.  My wife and I are both on a Keto diet and frequently dine together and eat the same thing.  It would be great if we could “eat together” or at least I could send her my meal so she didn’t also have to manually build out the meal or recipe.  You release that and this’ll get updated to 5 stars for sure!"
941,941,2,2018-02-19T04:51:36.000Z,Cbqwz007,Macros are not accurate,I was really excited about this app. I even signed up for the premium membership. After a few days of logging my food I realized that the macros reported on a lot of food is not accurate. I would have to go to MyPlate app to get the accurate macros. I understand allowing users to add foods but it should show if the macros have been verified like the MyPlate app does.   Also I signed up for the Keto Medium plan but many of the recipes are not even Keto. Very disappointed 😢
942,942,4,2018-04-28T22:31:04.000Z,Mckayla10210,Motivational,I downloaded this app because a had vacation coming up where I would get to see my family after Lamont 13 years. I love the water tips because it applies to the problems I’ve been having. It’s also shows you the right and wrongs of dieting and whether what you’re eating is good or bad. I highly recommend this app.
943,943,1,2018-07-18T06:58:37.000Z,MalloryW84,Not worth it,"There are so many free apps out there that will do the same thing as the “premium” subscription of this app. I thought I would be able to do a lot more with it if I upgraded for 3 months. Nope. Just basic features, a waste of $20 (non refundable). Within a month I canceled my account and deleted the app. Half of the foods I scanned would be incorrect entries. I’m glad I double checked labels because my calorie counts would've been extremely off. Defeats the purpose if I’m having to manually enter everything."
944,944,3,2018-08-27T18:48:33.000Z,kawaiikitsu,Eh,"So far I’m enjoying the app, the only thing that’s annoying is how there’s no way for it to account for the hours I work so my eating schedule is always off on the weekends since I’m a server. Also I eat at my restaurant so I’ll put in what I eat but I modify my food to take a lot of stuff off and there’s no way to modify the food you get in restaurants. You have to search each item individually and input them."
945,945,5,2021-01-27T18:24:50.000Z,jab.adam,"A good app, but I would like to see how close I was to my goal weight.","This app is great for overall health. Lose It displays pictures of every added item, add so to log it on any given day, you need only click on that picture. Would you consider such a function?"
946,946,4,2021-06-15T12:04:51.000Z,333kh,Doesn’t import recipes from web,"This is a great app and it syncs up better to my Apple Watch for my workouts than myfitnesspal does, but it does not allow you to import recipes from the web directly you have to input them manually which is very frustrating. Other than that, it works well"
947,947,4,2021-05-16T06:42:44.000Z,Shoosh4,Love everything except water!,I love this app and have grown to depend on it. I just hate the water options! It should be more detailed or we should be able to input our own.
948,948,5,2020-07-17T00:49:19.000Z,Selvitelle,Just learning,So far the app is pretty succinctly accurate. I study assiduously nutrition and am scrupulously learning about anti aging properties. This app helps to track things and offers wonderful suggestions for beginners in their wellness journey. I recommend paying the small fee for the year to enjoy all the app has to offer.
949,949,2,2020-03-19T05:03:22.000Z,Sallykiller1133,No thanks- doesn’t work,"You have to pay for anything that isn’t just a notepad to track what your eating, honestly id rather look up meals that’ll taste good and track it on paper and the app doesn’t even work right, I’ll log my 2nd or 3rd bottle of water for the day and check back an hour later to see that it says I haven’t drank it, or today i logged that I’d lost 2 pounds and it tried to reset the score to my original weight starting this, ITS BROKEN!!"

Of your personal water bottle to track accurate water intake , I use a 40 oz bottle and it’s hard to track it accurately with the app. Otherwise this app is amazing."

I thought I cancelled during the trial period just to find out I’ve been charged $50. It took a Google search for me to figure out how to manage the subscription and there isn’t a cancel button- it’s just on auto renew! BTW I’m calling my lawyer to see if that’s even legal. I should be able to opt out at any time with the guarantee it won’t auto renew. Also, you have to pay to connect the app to your Fitbit- boooooo!"
953,953,4,2019-01-11T04:14:13.000Z,deadass honest review,Needs net carbs,"I’ve done keto and used a keto specific app to track. That app subtracted fiber and sugar alcohol from total carbs=net carbs. I am currently carb cycling and the carbs are throwing me off b/c I forget to remember how much fiber/sugar alcohol to subtract. Maybe it’s in the premium version? Idk. Other than that it’s the only tracking app I keep going back to. This app would be SUPERIOR if you could custom set your macros. Whew, what a dream."

I paid a lot of money for the features not to work, such as the camera, improvements for my life score etc. Everytime I click on it it says download premium, yet when I click on the option I have it says I already downloaded it. I also have already been charged so I am not very happy. If this issue could be fixed ASAP that would be great."

Generally I track my food on my phone but if I want to build meals or read recipes on my iPad. They do not always sync right away is there a way to force sync so that both devices are on track with each other?
959,959,2,2019-10-17T14:22:24.000Z,MaggieMay1920,Tricked by Instagram Ad (again),"The ad made it look like this app planned meals tailor made to your needs. Instead it just gives you the calorie count you need to hit in order to achieve your goals and then tells you to pick out meals. The entire reason I downloaded the app was because I’m not sure what I should be eating and was looking for guidance. So basically the app is sufficient if you’re looking for a calorie tracker but beyond that, you’re on your own. Def wasted $ Wee!"
960,960,4,2017-09-25T13:58:02.000Z,Mattgn1,Good app if you’re serious,"This app, like other fitness apps is only good if you are serious with your health. The premium does an excellent job of helping you track more than calories. Hey I had really helped me push into my fitness goals. But the app is sometimes clunky to use (things can be hard to find and it occasionally crashes.)"
961,961,1,2018-02-27T23:56:50.000Z,prteof4,Not what I thought,Looks good visually but after I purchase premium and started looking at recipes and trying to import my own in there.  First off it’s too difficult to import your own and there is not enough variety of the recipes that I’m looking for.  Should have stayed with my other free apps instead of wasting the funds on this only find out it’s not what it seems immediately after I purchased it.  A lot of the things that I scan don’t even show up.  Would really like my money back.
962,962,2,2018-08-25T23:35:59.000Z,TheStevess,Potential but flawed pricing,"Seems like a fantastic app, but I can’t stand how you can’t do much at all without a premium plan, and most importantly, that the minimum plan offered is three months. Would prefer to see a one month or one week commitment, even if priced high (per month), with the ability to cancel sooner than three months. I don’t want to be roped into something for that long until I can at least spend a few days on it."

Also, I did something goofy with my Apple ID/subscription/deleting my account and their support team got me fixed up within an hour. Will absolutely be sticking with Lifesum for my 2021 New Years resolution 🎉"
966,966,2,2021-03-12T13:33:39.000Z,Nevereatpakuchi,Macros cannot be trusted,The biggest single problem is recording what you eat when the nutrition data cannot be trusted. More often than not I research with google. And yet the diary is the main point of the app. Just take a bottle of red wine for example: 100 grams (silly claim with 95% carbohydrates !!!and a wopping 210 gr. of net carbs!!! ) I pity someone who believes this.  I’ve used the app for a couple years but I wish I had shopped around for one with an honest macros tracker. This one has never been edited.
967,967,5,2020-03-09T19:44:40.000Z,brawj,Fantastic Interface to Apple Watch & Health data,I am very impressed with how this APP interfaces with the Apple Watch/Apple health App. A very large range of foods to enter with flexible volumes allow me to keep exact count on the calorie deficit I want to maintain to reach my weight gain goals each day/week/month and the app is super easy to use.
968,968,4,2020-04-15T20:05:21.000Z,alex marese,I love this app but they need to add something,I really love this app. It helps me alot. Im currently using it to gain weight and muscle mass. I just wish there was a way to put in our own recipes or atleast change the macros to our desired food. I want to add a dish that i found online that isnt on here. But i cant add the macros thats in it. I think that would be a really good feature to add

It would be so much easier if there was a 12 oz option, or even the ability to set your own units."
970,970,4,2018-05-28T02:37:21.000Z,Rizzuth,Would recommend,"I love this app, but have run into a couple issues. One is that I haven’t found a way to add meals straight from a plan into my diary. Another is that I changed my calorie intake number, but it still won’t update in the diary and is still calculating the old number. Other than that, it’s been really really helpful."
971,971,4,2018-05-29T14:53:47.000Z,Hanna112235,Premium payment,"Love the app, but I just bought the premium for 3 months. It said it was $7.33/month and that I could cancel anytime. Thought I would be paying for each month individually, but got charged the lump sum for the 3 months. Wish the payment was more clear or there was an option to pay each month separately"
972,972,5,2018-06-24T16:09:37.000Z,Heatherm91,So disappointed!,I am so disappointed with this app... I got it and paid for the premium for a whole year just to use the keto strict features... however! It STILL does not track net carbs! Totally defeated my purpose and I am really sad about my purchase if I could get a refund I would! Do not buy!
973,973,1,2018-08-07T00:13:11.000Z,Lemmaion,Not very good,"Unfortunately this app looked beautiful but only partially worked. I even got the premium version but it doesn’t work. I reached out to to customer service but no assistance. Basically I can use the food diary, look at recipes and other diet plans BUT it will not sync with the fitbit and add in steps SO none of my steps count. This is so disappointing because exercise is a key component if you’re trying to lose weight. Basically don’t buy this, it’s useless if you’re looking for something that will do it all."

You have to pay to receive the same quality as premium. A health journey is arduous in itself and I don’t appreciate how it’s limited to those who can’t afford premium."
976,976,3,2020-06-16T14:27:57.000Z,kaygaines,Pretty but pointless,"Paid for premium and I thought it was pretty, but the diets plans weren’t able to be edited. I wanted to check out all the plans out of curiosity but no matter what answers I put, I got the same plan. I also found putting certain foods into the app for tracking much more difficult than myfitnesspal. Eventually I just ended up going back to that."
977,977,4,2019-08-06T17:07:02.000Z,acortez0512,Good but could use some new information,I love the app and paying for premium but I wish the app also tracked vitamins and minerals. I am a vegan and I need to make sure I am getting all my vitamins as well. Myfitpal tracks vitamins but I picked Lifesum because it takes my workouts right off my Apple Watch. If you guys could add vitamin tracking this app would be amazing.
978,978,2,2020-02-01T04:26:25.000Z,Twest153,“Instagram” Food,"The app is user friendly, but the foods and recipes are super impractical. They’re “Instagram” recipes, with unrealistic ingredients. There are not options to input your specific food preferences (i.e. I don’t like salmon, beans, or avocados) so the meal options can be limited. Also, I really dislike that you can’t change the water input quantity to a specific ounce number. I find myself not tracking water at all because it’s so difficult to keep track of!"
979,979,1,2019-09-02T01:39:02.000Z,etm42,Nutrition Information is Wrong,"I purchased a one year subscription because I was interested in the health quiz. However, when I started to try to log my food I found out that the most basic ingredients have incorrect nutrition information. Old fashioned oats are 150 calories per 1/2 cup. Every entry that I could find for old fashioned oats says 150 calories per 1 cup. This is off by a factor of two. I could adjust but I shouldn’t have to. I will be seeking a refund. Avoid this app. I am going back to my fitness pal."

And it would be great if when you accidentally put food in the wrong time of the day to have an easy way to just switch the meal time rather  then RE enter it!
981,981,2,2018-07-04T02:23:22.000Z,KatieBow90,Fasting options,"Hi, I have been doing longer fasts in a row recommended by my doctor and I don’t really have an option for that on this app. It would be cool if you could add more days is all cause some people do 2-5 day broth fasts and there’s awesome studies on it right now. My app currently tells me my friends would be happier if I ate more and it just seems a little aggressive. The rest of the ability to see what I am eating and the break down of nutrition behind it all is great."
982,982,3,2018-09-08T04:14:42.000Z,LadyDocFL,My recommendations,"I am a new user & so far, I like it. Busy schedules do not allow sufficient time to log in with each meal."
983,983,5,2018-10-10T12:32:40.000Z,jmeurer,The best app,I am using the free app and it is so easy and convenient. If I can stick to one month of using the app I will buy the premium for sure. I have already lost 2 pounds and it has only been 3 days. Nothing has worked for me until now! Get this app you can lose fat!
984,984,5,2018-11-28T13:15:37.000Z,Drake_papa,Tracking,This app makes tracking macros easy. The data base is Immense and accurate to the nutrition label within just a few calories if not completely true to label. Turn on notifications to get frequent reminders to stay on track.
985,985,4,2019-01-16T15:31:48.000Z,Bokehgirl,Good looking app,I love the variety of weight loss plans my one thought though is that for intermittent fasting plans if you could also offer ones like 16:8 where you fast for 16 hours then eat. I am more partial to a plan like that but could use guidance and the ability to track it accordingly on the app. Is there any possibility to add this soon?
986,986,5,2019-01-25T06:50:20.000Z,scurrrvy,Liking it so far,I like the diet recommendations; this is the first app I’ve used that has a high protein option that still lets you also tweak your macros. Really nice design also. I like that it reads my exercise date from Fitbit. My only wish is that I could sync my calories to the Fitbit app.
987,987,3,2019-03-27T11:48:16.000Z,Kharanshu,Buggy,Not sure what happened the app was working great but after the last upgrade I’m having issues with burn tracking and the having to remove then reinstall the app because it changes to gain weight instead of lose and it won’t let you change it back any other way.  Really liked the app otherwise. It’s one of the best trackers I’ve used.
988,988,4,2019-04-10T02:35:26.000Z,allieee0708,Gorgeous App,I really love this app. It’s easy to use and visually appealing. The only thing is I’ve been using it for a day or two and I wanted to switch from the Keto burn plan to the Keto strict plan so I had more freedom with my meals. Every time I go to switch the app crashes. I’m sure this will be fixed with time and I still highly recommend the app.
989,989,3,2019-08-02T23:01:26.000Z,sarkatlab,Overall I like it,"I think it’s a good app, the design is impeccable and the biggest pull for me. My only big let down is that if you want to go premium (which you probably do) there’s no trial option to see if you like it, and you only have packages where to pay at least a few months up front but nothing where you can pay monthly which I would like."

Now everything I select Plans at the bottom menu, the whole app crashes!! So frustrating. I can’t access my shopping list or meals for the week now. Hope this gets fixed, otherwise it wasn’t worth upgrading!!!"
991,991,5,2019-02-19T23:43:58.000Z,matteson66,Where’s the planned meals?,I paid for the premium. Selected the diet plan. Went into the meal plans and can only see the first day. Can’t see any of the consecutive days and don’t see where I can create a shopping list for the week. Disappointed. Beginning to think I wasted my money.

Easy to use and aesthetically pleasing so I enjoy logging everything. Unfortunately, it suddenly erased all of my progress and now has the goal as “gain weight” and I cannot change it. So, I was extremely happy with it but now I can’t track my progress."
993,993,5,2020-03-10T05:55:33.000Z,CaseyGirl1987,Doesn’t work,I would type in all info on “basics” page and it doesn’t let me move on to the next screen. The “next” button wouldn’t work when I clicked it and if you can’t advance to next screen nothing happens.
994,994,2,2021-07-20T02:46:26.000Z,Curt J,"Cumbersome, confusing, and judgey","I really tried hard to like this app. I logged my food daily for almost a month and after almost a month I’m done. Not only is it excruciating to find the right calorie counts, the counts you finally find are inaccurate and the app judges you for what seem to be reasonable lifestyle choices. I don’t think I can handle another frownie face that I’m eating natural sugar."
995,995,2,2021-01-16T03:33:06.000Z,sereenybobeeny,Keeps changing setting,I loved this app so much so I updated so I can have better look on what I’m eating. It keeps changing my calories and macros for the day. Idk how many times I have to go back into my personal setting and see if it’s set at where it should be but it keeps glitching and adding more calories and macros. It’s very frustrating because it requires me to do so much double checking and adjusting when it should be a quick glance.
996,996,2,2020-11-14T19:34:55.000Z,thistletan,Looks nice but does not work well...,Dont let first impressions fool you... the UI is not up to the standard of other diet trackers and a little more expensive annually.

After spending almost 3 days to get the hang of how the app works and actively using it for almost 2 days it suddenly quit working.  Didn’t offer my meal plan, I tried emailing tech support- no response.  I deleted the app and then reinstalled, would send me an email to reset my password even!!!  So frustrating"
998,998,3,2020-04-05T13:53:46.000Z,tjidd417,Can’t share with friends,The biggest problem with this app is that there is no social networking feature. The biggest contributor to sticking to a diet is doing it with a friend and this app does not support sharing with friends. Big disappointment especially because after searching the web this feature has been requested since at least 2016.

This is an issue I’ve never experienced before. The individual meals tell me I’m under my calorie intake by 400 and the large number for calories under says I’m under by 100. Very dis motivating to see it displayed as such in a large way when the number is not correct. Please fix ASAP"

I like the simplicity, but if you dig around the app has so many features. I’ve had issues syncing with my FitBit but Lifesum has been very responsive. I love this app!"
1001,1001,3,2018-05-27T20:50:18.000Z,pthomas99,"Ok, needs changes","I purchased the premium version of the app and felt like I still did not get the ability to design the diet the way I wanted it. You can’t change macros, you can’t really change your own calorie intake and I felt like the plans were very one size fits all when in reality that doesn’t work. Wouldn’t recommend and I regret purchasing the premium version!"

However, this app is what led me into my eating disorder. It’s the reason I’m still a recovering anorexic. The age limit should be much higher and there needs to be a relook at how they make things bc I put in my weight and height only to be told I could eat 1200 calories a day, at 12 years old. Insane. If I ate more than I could, I was told to workout. If I didn’t, the weight would go up on the app which made me feel awful about myself."

Once I complete a workout and it is recorded by the third party app, the calories burned from that workout is imported into Lifesum but then the calories burned from just my steps is removed. This then throws off the amount of calories left for intake. Is this a setting I can correct, or is it something wrong with the App?"

1014,1014,3,2018-10-16T05:45:16.000Z,teenageguru,Sorta Good,I’ve used this app for about 3 months and it helped me lose weight but I don’t think it accurately tracks motion even though connected to my health app. Perhaps it’s a bug or just one less perk from not being premium? It says I only burn 7 calories and I have other apps that say otherwise and are more concise. Needs work on tracking movement and such to correspond with eating habits.
1015,1015,1,2018-10-30T14:04:54.000Z,Vulgar demos,Bad functionality,Search of food is terrible. Have to scroll for 5 minutes each time to find anything relevant. Also makes really bad mistakes when entering food for previous day. Automatically adds it to today every time and you have to keep deleting and correcting it. Super unreliable. Also lots of junk stats in random entries that need to be cleaned up. Very few products actually verified by Lifesum. It’s pretty. But bad functionality means: Overall my least favorite diet tracker so far.

I’m sure if you purchase the premium version, you won’t have any issues. However, I didn’t want to commit to premium version immediately. Unfortunately you are bombarded with ads/pop-ups ‘encouraging’ you to upgrade. Literally every time I tapped on the screen, another ad/pop-up would appear. It’s annoying. I’ll stick with MyFitnessApp."

There is a recipe called vegan mushroom pasta and it calls for vegetable cream. Wtflip is vegetable cream. I’ve looked on the internet and nothing comes up as vegetable cream. Then I tried to make a recipe called vegan cauliflower garam masala and it called for chili flakes and then when I read the instructions it never tells you when to use the ingredient! I’m getting tired of trying to follow these recipes.

Since then I gained weight, and lost 16 pounds once using the app. However, it used to say “gained 2 pounds” since I was 2 pounds heavier in total than I was a while ago. Now it says “lost 3 pounds”. It would be nice to update my weight retroactively so it accurately shows “lost 16 pounds”"

I am a breastfeeding mom which means I need to consume 500 extra calories a day. I’m sure the people who created the app just don’t know a lot about post partum dieting so I probably should have kept looking for something else. I regret purchasing the three months.
1034,1034,4,2018-09-16T18:24:41.000Z,Mrslpez,Keto and this App has helped,"So let’s start off by saying that KETO works. I’ve used MyFitnessPal and it’s helped tremendously to know what I’m putting on my mouth. HOWEVER, I’m a sucker for layouts and organization. Lifesum beats them in that. MyFitnessPal biggest issue for me was NET carbs not calculating correctly. I had to use 2 different apps (carb manager and MyFitnessPal), to figure out next carbs."

They get to be really confusing where items I put in my meal get big smiles but the meal grimaces. Or if they could give you more info than just “off track” as to why they’re grimacing, it can help me learn instead of rolling my eyes at the innocuous rating system."

I’ll scan a barcode and the information that this app gives me is about 10 cal off from the packaging. And it’s like that for so many foods, and it doesn’t have nearly as many foods as MFP. Also, the interface, while pretty, is not as intuitive as it thinks it is. Back to laggy MFP I go."

A piece of the app has time/date issues if you live in America. At 6pm my time, the app’s journal and food log have already shifted to the next day and you can’t select for it to go backwards in time. The grocery list is ridiculous and doesn’t exist if you aren’t on a specific diet plan. The macros are incorrect and display properly. Be aware!"

It totally limits your ability to use the measurement you need (eg, doesn’t offer cups, tsp, etc for all foods); many of the measurements are crazy incorrect (eg 200 calories for one cup but 5,000 for one TBSP); and it keeps deleting my exercises linked from FitBit.

My only complaint is that you can’t do a meal plan without getting Lifesum premium. That bothers the heck outta me. That was actually one of the main things I got this app and I can’t do it without having to pay. Like I said that is my only complaint and everything else is great. I would still recommend it to others.

What turned me off was that the max starting weight one could enter was 300lbs. I’m 360lbs, and the app didn’t believe me, it asked if I was sure I put in the right number. Is there a certain algorithm in the app that is unable to compute anything higher? Sorry, maybe I’ll check this app out again when I’m below 300."

What I don’t enjoy is within my first use of this app I was given three negative judgements: I was told I gained weight, I was overweight, and that olive oil deserves an “ugh” face. Losing weight is fraught with feeling bad. This app needs to adjust its symbolism and approach to the user to lean more towards positivity."

I’ve used lots of calorie counting apps and this one is especially frustrating for logging the basics, like an egg. It seems to reward eating out — the top items in search results are for restaurants etc. I eat mostly at home and prefer apps that are more geared to that."

There’s no free trial and the developer’s FAQ says that I can get a refund from Apple if I request it in 14 days. Turns out that isn’t true. It hasn’t even been 24 hours and I put in a request for a refund to Apple and it was denied because it didn’t “meet their criteria” for a refund. Turns out the truth is all sales are final. I’d avoid this app at all costs unless you’re 100% certain that it’s exactly what you want.

I’ve reached out and have even sent an email to tech support but they never bothered addressing my issue or even responding to my email. Great app but horrible customer service.

I bought a year subscription and I can’t tell you how many times the app has said I have burned 500 more calories than what my Apple Watch has said (which is where it’s connected at). Not only that there are several calories wrong based off the actual nutritional information off the box itself. I just would not waste my money. Pretty sure that’s exactly what I did too and they won’t give me my money back.

I want to be able to use both — app for meal entry and quick tracking, and website for meal planning and cooking."

App requires an internet connection, and Lifesum’s servers are frequently down. Also, database of foods is wildly inaccurate, sometimes comically so. You absolutely cannot rely on it for correct calorie or protein counts. Which means you’ll be using Google all the time to look up nutrition information, causing you to ask why you bothered to download this app and subscribe to the service."

These devs don’t care what looks good, but only for your money. MyPlate app dashboard is easier to quickly read without squinting and is more visually appealing because everything is bigger. Lifesum guys stared out making a quality app and then evolved into not giving a crap only wanting your money. I wouldn’t buy the Lifesum if it was 75% off."

1095,1095,2,2019-05-21T07:33:40.000Z,SamTheTechNerd15,VERY Inaccurate,"I absolutely love the layout of the app, everything is extremely easy to use! The advertising is, however, quite excessive if you’re not a premium member. The worst part about the app, and the reason I no longer use it, is because the nutrition facts for food items were just HORRIBLY inaccurate! I have yet to find a food item whose nutrition facts in the app match the nutrition facts for the same serving size listed on the bag."
1096,1096,5,2019-08-02T11:58:54.000Z,Chase_345,Best macro app I have found,"All around very good app. At first I was a little disappointed because I was un aware that I could create custom meals and enter custom macros for at home recipes, but a developer informed me of that ability! That, plus the extensive food database makes it easy and fun to count!"
1097,1097,5,2021-05-05T17:10:54.000Z,Poopugs,Great for keto or regular healthy eating,I used this before I started Keto and it helped me manage my healthy eating.

I tried different ones before landing on the Mediterranean diet. By using the app, I have improved my diet, gained awareness of what I am eating, and lost weight. Thank you!"

It offers plans along with grocery list. Therefore price is reasonable. Very happy with this app great design, great attention to detail."
1100,1100,5,2019-05-04T17:42:04.000Z,Stephanie Unick,Lifesum is Great!,"I really enjoy this app. It’s hard to stay motivated in eating healthy all the time. I love the way it shows you how much fat,carbs, and protein you’re eating so you know how much you need to get the right proportions. If you are struggling with the discipline to eat healthy, try this app."
1101,1101,3,2019-05-21T12:37:36.000Z,SRP2018,Good app- would like one more feature,I’ve been using this app for almost a year now and whenever I am actively tracking it is really helpful. I saw on some old blog posts that you can share your progress/meals with friends but it does not look like an option any more. I would give a 5 star review if this were an active feature.
1102,1102,5,2020-01-05T17:23:46.000Z,ChelseaMederes,I need to speak to someone!,The app is great so far and it makes it fun and motivates you more to add the amount of water intake throughout the day.
1103,1103,1,2020-12-31T01:55:30.000Z,AnnH1977,Most frustrating app,"Coming from MFP this app is way less user friendly, has way less items when you search for stuff, just all around painful.  The only reason people are even giving any more than one star is because it’s pretty.  Such a frustrating app.  If you reverse the word you search you get completely different results.  Half the times the searches aren’t even in there and you have to manually enter all the info."

The recipes aren’t the greatest but the part that we dislike the most is we can’t share our custom recipes so we can stay on track. Maybe something can be added a little down the road like carb managers app.."
1105,1105,4,2020-05-06T17:36:18.000Z,Prince Flare,Good but incomplete,"The calorie tracker is amazing for calorie intake. But it falls off for tracking calories burned. The limit on the type of exercises is damaging to the performance of the app. Also, if there was an option to switch from minutes done to reps/sets done, it would increase the accuracy of the workout portion."
1106,1106,2,2020-04-08T03:02:13.000Z,ticked off tammy,Good... but could be better,"I don’t hate this app. It’s a great way to track your meals and water intake, but it’s lacking in some areas. Maybe it’s because I didn’t get a subscription, but almost all of the exercises I do were “unable to be found” when I went to log them. Also, some of the foods I logged were completely different on the labels than in the app, and I did not enjoy the massive discrepancies."
1107,1107,4,2020-01-07T00:55:58.000Z,Brettnee,Good App,I like the app because it has most store bought items. I wish it had more meals and way to edit them. I use the paleo diet and I see meals and I would like to add them but state items I excluded so that it gives me a better reading. Just a feature I would appreciate . Including more meals on the paleo food.

Also when you switch the goal, it won’t recalculate the calories again, but when you change the weeks needed, it will eventually recalculate the calories."

However, after new update there is a glitch that won’t show calories burned. It sets to zero for a couple seconds then shows calories burned. Not a big deal but is kind of annoying."

I also wish they had a larger exercise library. Small wish list for a great app. The smiley faces that let me know how I’m doing are too cute as well
1112,1112,1,2018-12-16T13:35:56.000Z,Pony0413,Poor performance for a great idea,"Calorie count, fat count, protein count, carb count... nearly twice a day I add a food to my diary and the counts are all off. Milk doesn’t have 30 grams of sugar. The conversions are not calculating correctly either. This was such a waste of money and there is no way to get a refund. If the developers spent more time on getting accurate information and less time on looking pretty they would make a real difference, otherwise this is just a sham. Really disappointed."
1113,1113,5,2019-01-15T16:22:42.000Z,LetMeSayThis,Honest opinion,"I like the layout and ease of adding a goal and foods to my daily log. However, I want to keep track of the total water I drink, not just the suggested goal. I surpass that water goal when I make it the max. I’d like to just keep adding oz by oz to my daily intake."

I thought it was because I have the free version so I paid to see if that would make it start tracking my calories burned again. And it still doesn’t! I googled it and it seems to be a reoccurring issue with users. Please fix this!!!"
1115,1115,2,2019-04-09T03:11:14.000Z,jen from lv,Beautifully Bad...,I wanted to love this App so much bc of its visual appeal- I stop using it a couple months ago and switched to a different app. Today I used this one again with high hopes but the database is still messed up. I scanned some barcodes and wrong nutritional value comes up.  Also the measurements are random on different items so I find myself looking thru multiple items to find what works best.  Too much of a headache.

I don’t think I’ll be able to use it very effectively because the food plan I follow is not available. Please offer a Lectin Free option for those of us healing with the Plant Paradox program.  I don’t want lectures about how healthier unhealthy it is, it works for me. I will delete the app soon if I cannot use it. Otherwise, I think it’s helpful for a lot of people."

It won’t let me login through Apple ID, email, nor facebook. It keeps telling me that it doesn’t match the client secret. Which makes no sense to me because i have never used this app before so i literally have no idea what any of this means. I tried searching for what it means and I found absolutely nothing. I dont see the point in using this app if I can’t even sign in at all."
1120,1120,1,2017-10-23T18:20:27.000Z,Mrsyogi3,No need for premium!,"Kind of annoyed that I upgraded to the premium to get the ""plans"" however they are not plans at all, rather a generic overview of what that type of diet consists of. Why would I pay the subscription when nothing changed! I could have still tracked my food intake without upgrading! Seems just like myfitnesspal. I was hoping for something better with this app and was hoping the plans were actually going to be something you can follow."

If I’m in settings and tap “Personal Details,” for example, and then swipe back, I won’t return to the Settings menu I was in. The app will glitch out and send me back to my “Profile” page. Please fix!"
1122,1122,1,2018-05-02T13:24:23.000Z,Shakti Devi,Major lack of thorough accuracy,"First, there’s no way to connect with a support team or person. I’m not able to deactivate a plan so it’s changing my daily Caloric expectations, which I don’t want. And, I am also trying to change the protein, carbs and fat ratio for the meals that I create, because their system is not calculating anything correctly. There’s no way to change that, so what’s the point? Now I have to go through the inconvenient process of canceling and getting my money back."
1123,1123,5,2018-06-09T22:02:25.000Z,Blur23,An Idea,What if the app on your home screen had the circle actually fill up according to your actual calorie intake. So if I was half way to my calorie count for the circle would be half filled on the front of the app on your home page.

1126,1126,2,2021-01-27T02:09:05.000Z,ronniebev,:),"The design of the app is very user friendly and the overall layout is appealing. My only issue with this app was the use of smiley/frowning faces next to the foods. The whole point of calorie counting is to know the macronutrient breakdown of your food and the appropriate portions. There shouldn’t be an emotional connection to the food itself. There’s no “bad” food, just food that needs to be eaten in moderation. It seems like an eating disorder in the making."

Not only did it not allow for a refund after I decided within 8 minutes that the upgrade was trash, but it also doesn’t take into account different types of diets, allergies, and dislikes. DO NOT BUY THIS APP because it is a scam. I’m so mad I’m out $30 for an upgrade that was the farthest thing from helpful. Give me my money back & make it possible for people with different allergies to succeed with this horrible app."

U,Wish I could edit,If there was an app like this that let me put I’m disabled and can’t do the exercises or amount it wants I’d be happy and it would be the perfect app. I love everything about this one except that it takes points off because my exercise and walking is low.
1132,1132,5,2020-04-23T10:45:21.000Z,MigALora,Something is wrong,Pretty easy app to use once you get into the rhythm of recording everything. I would suggest perhaps having the ability to separate the different snacks and not just have them altogether.

Why have recipes but not organize them into meal plans to make things easier on people.  The entire purpose of the app is to make eating and living healthy easier but good lord it’s such a terrible UX.  The whole favoriting and pulling recipes is terrible.

This plan has meat recipes for it though? Why would it even ask if i eat meat or not if its just going to reccomend meat recipes. I thought it would give me recipes and a grocery shop list(definetly should if you pay a subscription) but it just gives me recipes that dont even align with my diet.

I use a different app to track water and remind me to drink water. I don’t want to track my water via lifesum. PLEASE fix this. It’s such a small thing but it would make this a 5 Star review.

My calorie intake and exercise calories are consistently mixed up and every few days I have go into the settings to manually turn on the exercise tracking again. It has the potential to be a great app but honestly it’s a little frustrating to use daily. Bugs need to get fixed - especially if people are expected to upgrade to premium.

That is not the case until after your initial payment of the full year...I don’t appreciate being misled into purchasing a full year upfront when I really only wanted to pay monthly. Now I basically have to ask for permission to get my money back from apple...who knows how long that’ll take...

1163,1163,5,2018-08-10T07:27:13.000Z,Taco with goku,Great app,Was really under weight and was constantly worried on how I looked (15 year old boy) After getting this app it Helped me stick to my goal went from 75 pounds to 125 in a little over a year great app helped me bunch would highly recommend it
1164,1164,2,2019-01-09T20:30:59.000Z,User123484727,Decent. Just not for me,"I like simple. There's SOO much going on in this app that it makes it unintuitive. Also, I had chicken breast and scrambled eggs for breakfast, how is it that there's like 3 options for scrambled eggs? 1.8oz, 1.9oz, etc. Then you have to make sure you add the right one the next morning or it'll throw off the consistency of tracking calories/what you eat anyway. Like I said, it's pretty, just not what I was looking for. So 2 stars for pretty."
1165,1165,1,2019-01-11T14:58:15.000Z,Jskdgcqaiyefbvfeeibvfruivu,Didn’t even start,"I used to use this app a while ago and just recently re-downloaded it after I put in my email to make a new account and put done it shows me that it’s loading but never does. I tried deleting the app and re-downloading it I’ve tried changes WiFi setting, going to a different location to see if it loads and it won’t load. Everything else on my phone is running just fine so it has to be the app."
1166,1166,2,2019-03-03T20:01:33.000Z,Shelbydevil0,Wish I could get my money back,Entering in food is not as easy or accurate as MyFitnessPal. They do not have a big enough database. I do like that I can scan items but I wish I could create my own meals and save them.
1167,1167,5,2019-03-22T01:17:09.000Z,Classy ginger,Just started using this app,"First let me say it is a gorgeous layout and very visually appealing. For me, it makes me WANT to log my food and normally I get bored with journal entries. I did sign up for the premium but the price was fair. I’m looking forward to using this. Nice job to the developers!"
1168,1168,2,2019-03-25T18:05:29.000Z,Unkwn 2327,Fix the bugs!,It was working just fine but it started to change my settings on its own! I selected that I want to lose weight and it continues to change to gain weight. If this bug is not fixed I would like my money back. I paid for the full year so at least refund me the other 11 months worth cause it’s pointless for me to have paid for an app that is not doing its job.
1169,1169,5,2021-07-21T13:24:32.000Z,real mom life,Post partum,This is so helpful when I was postpartum for eating more healthy  meals. But what I really loved is as a busy mom I forget to eat and this would remind me now I just need to have the practice of food prepping it all before the week starts! 🥰thank you so much!
1170,1170,4,2019-06-08T05:23:34.000Z,kaydeedid850,Good content at upgrade levels.,Seems like a great app. Have to pay for the most useful content. Free version doesn’t provide much support. A great added feature is the ability to choose a status specific for nursing mothers as they burn and should consume added calories.
1171,1171,5,2019-10-02T01:19:20.000Z,dandilionflowers,Love love love it,"I’ve never wanted to pay for an app before but I am def upgrading for this one! Easy to use. Gives me tips, sync with my watch and tracks my exercise. Totally recommend to anyone wanting to track calories, carbs, fat. Helps tailor a diet plan for me! Love it"
1172,1172,3,2021-03-12T20:35:51.000Z,dorothy1229,Calorie intake,I just got the app and I am struggling as to why my calorie intake changes daily. I am starting around 1600 because I am cutting and then after lunch today I check my nutrition and I am suppose to eat over 2k.
1173,1173,3,2021-03-04T18:27:43.000Z,jaclynherbert,Took away all features.,"I have been using this app for 2 years now, and I log in to track for the day and not I have to pay a subscription for the features I’ve been using for 2 years already! Kind of annoying that I need to find a new app now. Great app I loved using it, not worth paying monthly for it though."
1174,1174,4,2021-01-26T18:24:44.000Z,Lillywastaken,Amazing but....,I love Lifesum! I found it from Chloe Ting! It tracks my calorie intake and tells me what I should be eating! I also love how it gives a reaction to the meal you eat. But... I don’t like how you have to pay to eat access to the meals. I do understand they need to make money! Over all I recommend even if u don’t get premium!
1175,1175,2,2020-04-21T20:39:23.000Z,ToriAnne1214,Beautiful and Buggy,"The app is beautiful and well designed but the performance is subpar. I often have problems adding food to meals, there’s no easy way to just input macros from a recipe you make outside the app and when I do try to create a recipe on the app, it will crash or cancel making me have to redo all my work. Getting frustrated and only staying to use because I already payed for a subscription."
1176,1176,3,2020-03-10T16:46:05.000Z,Tinnie117,Visually appealing but lots of bugs,"This app is great for tracking macros and food intake and has a lot of healthy recipes as well as plans to help kick start your health journey. However, there are a few bugs that don’t make it a perfect 5 star:"
1177,1177,3,2020-01-06T20:10:58.000Z,ciaramont,Awesome but could use some work!,"The App is really great to keep track of everything which is supper nice! However, when it comes to the food and meal plans it would be nice to be able to add food allergies, or add a list for good substitutes for certain foods because I am not able to eat certain ingredients that I’m supposed to be eating in the meal plans!"
1178,1178,5,2019-07-23T15:46:04.000Z,jaimelees,Great app,"I have been using this app for about a year and a half.  Easiest app I have found for tracking macros, especially Keto macros. Well worth the premium. I just recently switched to an iPhone and I love it even more. I recommend it to everyone!"
1179,1179,3,2019-06-28T12:13:53.000Z,I once was Fat,Average tracker,"The app is an average tracker. Has plenty of food options to choose from, has good reminders etc.  For what you pay the only way this app will spring into a superior tracker that is above the rest it will need to have a way to add personal recipes and nutrients, without that it’s a guessing game with what you choose and if your macros etc are correct."
1180,1180,4,2017-10-11T17:25:45.000Z,Beachiigirll,Love,"I love the app over all, it's user friendly and I love the smiley faces to tell me how I am doing. However, I HATE that it doesn't count net carbs especially because that is so important for a keto diet, since this app has the setting for a keto diet I would think it should be able"
1181,1181,2,2018-03-10T18:49:36.000Z,Arabellaaaa,Crashes a lot,"I like how nice the design is, very easy on the eyes. However it is not very intuitive to use and a little clunky to delete food after you’ve input it but decided to eat something else. It also crashes all the time, even though I keep it updated. It closes randomly all the time and one time made my phone shut off because it crashed so hard."
1182,1182,4,2018-06-02T20:14:52.000Z,tevelyn,New Feature Idea,Great app! helps me to be aware of what i’m putting in my body and to drink more water!! i have a suggestion for a new feature: a reminder to take any pills you need. for example a little button like the water that you press when you take your pills to help remind you!!
1183,1183,4,2018-06-30T00:41:12.000Z,jenny.k.macleod,"Beautiful app, but please add customization for the number of meals!","Love this interactive, beautiful app.  I do wish I could customize the number of meals I eat per day.  There is only the option of breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack, but I eat 5-6 small meals per day.  And when I add my 4th meal into snack I get a sad face for going over my calorie target... :("
1184,1184,5,2018-07-05T17:07:32.000Z,Vivian7T,Helpful Tool,I wanted a visual representation of my weight loss journey and Lifesum works very well for this job. I’m able to achieve my goals with this handy app. Very simple to use and customize. I would recommend this to others who want a food/habit tracker.
1185,1185,3,2018-07-15T05:22:11.000Z,Jarom Allen,So much wasted potential,"This app is pretty good, but could be so much better. Logging meals is inferior to MyFitnessPal by a wide margin, and it’s one redeeming quality is syncing other fitness apps to track calorie burn and update daily calorie goals automatically. However, this feature is extremely inconsistent and unreliable. If it became stable it would get five stars from me."
1186,1186,5,2018-08-14T18:01:23.000Z,Spvkurup,Lifesum is my health consultant,"I strongly recommend everyone to upgrade to premium who are currently using this app as you will unlock a world realization and awareness. Those who are not using this app, you are really missing something. Kudos to Lifesum for coming up with such a great app."
1187,1187,3,2019-01-11T16:16:37.000Z,kaykeez,Nutrition info is off on a lot of items,I love this app but I really want the options to have reliable nutrition info. Maybe it would help to add an option to punch in your own nutrition info if you are looking at a box or your out to eat where the nutrition info is displayed? I was going to pay for premium but then I noticed how off the numbers are.
1188,1188,4,2020-10-27T18:05:26.000Z,Taco club,Just a little suggestion,"The app is great but the only thing I found slightly difficult was the water tracking, I wish they could add an option to where you can adjust the oz to your desired amount rather than the one they set for you"
1189,1189,3,2020-08-18T21:40:37.000Z,Hvance1990,Needs the ability to make your own recipes,The apps is simple and clean. I like the better than MyFitnessPal which has gotten way to expensive. But what I do miss and was hoping this app would have is the ability to create your own recipes. It would make it more flexible for diets the app doesn’t necessary seem to include.
1190,1190,5,2020-05-25T17:24:02.000Z,melodias 2.0 is coming,Lifesum,It is a wonderful app that lets you get heathy in the pace that you want and it tells you how much fat and protein it has and it has help me and other people it is the best diet plan app that you will find. if your looking for a diet plan app all ways use Lifesum.
1191,1191,4,2020-06-21T15:17:16.000Z,jreyno40,There are some bugs,One particularly annoying bug: the weight on my goal will revert to the starting weight every few days and lose the weight that I had input the day previously. I then have to go into “Me”->”track measurements” and then update it manually.
1192,1192,5,2019-12-11T02:39:11.000Z,Suggestion Man.,Great app,I would like to say i love this app but i also have a few suggestions. I would like to see a more in depth custom meal option. And also an intermediate fasting plan involving 16 hours of fasting and 10 hours eating window please and thank you
1193,1193,4,2020-05-19T14:49:40.000Z,kelsemarie,Love this app,I love the life sum app because it gives you a grade on what you eat and helps to better pick quality calories. The only thing it’s missing is it doesn’t have an option to add if your pregnant or breastfeeding. I wish it would help to add in those breastfeeding calories.
1194,1194,3,2020-04-12T15:38:58.000Z,The Creative Curtis,Hasn’t improved much,"I got this app a year ago. The food database is awesome, but they haven’t given any love to the workout section. Also, I don’t see a way to group items into a favorite meal. For example, I may have a protein shake with many different ingredients like oats, fruit and veggies. Doesn’t seem to let me group them together and give the group a name."
1195,1195,3,2020-02-27T04:30:19.000Z,LadyDhestroyer,Great App Needs a Few Tweaks,This app is great but the ability to make edits that show up immediately would be helpful. Also the ability to make meals and foods right from the diary/food entry screen would make it pretty close to perfect. All in all I love the dark color scheme and the information the app gives in one place. Keep up the good work.
1196,1196,2,2020-01-21T19:45:51.000Z,Supercomicgirl,Can’t  edit nutrition,This app seems like it could be great except when you add a new food there doesn’t seem to be a way to add in any nutritional information except calories. I was wondering if this a premium feature except looking online it seems this has been a issue for years. I may go premium any ways to test the meal plans but as is I’m probably going to delete it soon
1197,1197,5,2019-10-01T02:50:09.000Z,Breezy4240,Love this app! So motivating!,This app gives real time feedback with everything you eat. It’s motivating me to improve my diet with slight adjustments that I hope will make a real lasting impact on my weight loss journey.  I would highly recommend trying this app!
1198,1198,1,2019-10-15T14:04:15.000Z,MJD Crappy App,Don't buy this,"Most ridiculous non-intuitive app ever. Needlessly complicated, inconsistent, lack of any help or useful instructions to help you get started. Good luck trying to create s shopping list. I finally managed to sort of figure it but when I went the grocery store the next day and tried to open it, it did I had no list. Waste of money.  I regret buying a subscription because I've struggled enough and am tired of the constant frustration. I'm trashing it."
1199,1199,4,2019-08-17T18:41:52.000Z,BrookeAnn2292,Love this app... need a pregnancy option,"I love to use it to track the amount of carbs and protein and fat I’m getting. Wish there was an option to put that you’re pregnant so it can adjust accordingly. Otherwise, this app is great for people who aren’t pregnant and looking to be/stay healthy or lose weight."
1200,1200,3,2017-12-07T03:03:38.000Z,thewangone,Okay but can’t edit or add food,"Overall, I like that I can set the app to my goals. However, a lot of foods on it are incredibly wrong. Comparing a label to what the app says shows a huge indiscretion, so I doubt a lot of the numbers I get. I also can’t seem to find a way to edit or add new foods. It’s a bit unfortunate since this is one of the few apps focused on the Keto diet."
1201,1201,4,2018-03-23T17:06:05.000Z,Cinnamon Mamma,Love it,I just bought this app and am on day 2 of using it.
1202,1202,4,2018-06-05T03:38:33.000Z,Bystech77,It’s okay!,"I like almost everything about this app but there is one thing you can improve on. It won’t allow me to add my foods from Pinterest with all their nutritional values. I can add calories or take a picture, but nothing else. I can’t get an accurate reading because of it."
1203,1203,3,2018-07-26T06:50:02.000Z,hihealthy,Ok but not super user friendly,App is ok but not super user friendly. It doesn’t seem to create a base of items entered in the past unless you mark as favorites. Additionally I paid for the premium subscription because of the meal plans but there is no plan except for weight loss. Not all of us need to lose weight! The opposite is also not that easy.
1204,1204,5,2018-08-11T13:58:06.000Z,AdventureGirl 68,So helpful!,"I love this App!!! It has so many diet options, it’s perfect for anyone. Very intuitive and easy to use. I’ve even used it to scan foods in the grocery store...I get immediate feedback on whether it’s a good choice for the diet I’m following (with a happy or sad face)."
1205,1205,5,2018-12-06T00:38:58.000Z,SolinTheSecond,Fix the sync with Health,The app with randomly not add the steps tracked by Health into the exercise tab for the day. This is annoying. I thought it had been fixed with the last update because it hadn’t happened for a while but nope.
1206,1206,5,2018-12-08T13:53:04.000Z,Darcy-Loves-Karla,Awesome,"Was really iffy for this app but i actual was able to keep track of everything and inclusively you get so many great tips to reach whatever goal you’re out to look for, well done thank you developers 🙌🏻"
1207,1207,4,2019-06-03T21:18:49.000Z,Halfbuc,Some needed Improvements,I love this app and the layout but there are some features I wish they would implement. Some little features like when
1208,1208,2,2019-07-22T13:40:38.000Z,PissedJB,TRASH TRASH TRASH !!!,"I’ve been using this app for two years now. They started charging you for most of the features. However, I still use it as a free user. This whole weekend the app has been acting up. Not logging food items in correctly and then switching the servings on its own. I tried reaching out to the developer haven’t received any response.   Get it together developer 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"
1209,1209,1,2019-06-16T10:01:04.000Z,Gledism,???,It doesn’t even let me write my own weight the right way. Im from Europe so we use kg not lbs.
1210,1210,4,2019-04-06T17:58:12.000Z,#1 harrypoterfan,love this app!,"Really easy too add food and workouts. I’ve tried other apps and really didn’t like them, but this one has me hooked. The only thing I don’t like is when trying to access the recipes it wants me to get a membership. No, Honey no, I ain’t paying. Overall I really like the app."
1211,1211,5,2020-11-16T03:45:55.000Z,Dee-princess,Just wow,Sometimes it’s really hard for me to be encouraged to be healthy and to exercise. But this app has really made it easier for me to loose weight. My family suffers from obesity and now I feel like my best self. Thank you so much for this app.

1213,1213,3,2021-01-08T14:21:27.000Z,Kingtravis309,It won’t let me edit my numbers,I am 6’3 and it was saying I was 6’0 I tried to fix this and everytime i move it im told “Are you sure that’s what you meant? Please try a different number. It’s the same with the weight it asks me to adjust it but I can’t because it gives me that same message like I’m supposed to weight .01 lbs or something.

1215,1215,1,2020-09-11T12:10:32.000Z,Big bad bear13,Update your app!,"Lifesum doesn’t do nearly enough bug fixes and updates to their app. I am enjoying the free version for the most part but the most annoying problem is when I spend 15 long minutes logging a meal from yesterday, it glitches and moves the entire meal to today. So then I have to add it all back in for yesterday with fingers crossed that it doesn’t repeat the same glitch. This happens every day so fix the app please!"
1216,1216,1,2020-07-18T14:35:32.000Z,Cecila Dee Bean,Junk,"At first I liked the app, but on the 6th day I tried to update my weight and suddenly all of my entries for the last three days were gone (weight, good, water intake). I tried to update  at least my weight for the previous days for the sake of tracking and it simple would not save my progress for previous days. I’ve spent ten minutes trying to do something that simple and the app won’t let me. Also, no place for notes."
1217,1217,3,2020-06-16T23:50:28.000Z,Ahgddfcfuhdt,Change the Weight Settings,I am trying to lose weight but the app does not allow me to set my target weight because it is too low of a BMI value. Please change this because the weight I am trying to get to is still considered healthy to me and my doctor and using BMI as an indicator of what weight is healthy/unhealthy is outdated and misleading.
1218,1218,2,2020-03-11T19:27:38.000Z,Jerrycherry27,It’s ok,Since it’s a paid app I figured they would have more options. I don’t see many recipes options for paleo style I wish they had video tutorials on how to make some of these meals. They have wayyyyy to more fish  and shrimp options and for a person like me allergic to fish and shrimp I’m left with very little choices but even with the shrimp and fish they still don’t have that many varieties of food recipes
1219,1219,3,2019-08-21T13:34:34.000Z,hskskendd,NEEDS A MONTHLY PAYMENT OPTION,"This app is extremely appealing to me because of the sleek design and the simplicity of the app that also provides a lot of information but I was hoping that there would be a monthly payment option in which I would then purchase premium, but for the time being I will not use this app much."
1220,1220,2,2018-10-28T20:19:57.000Z,vie.pac,Pretty but not practical,"I originally downloaded this app because I like the graphics and organization of it all. I understand why the menus and plans are only available with upgrade to premium, but there is no reason why adjusting your macros or caloric intake on the classic plan should be a premium setting. I refuse to pay  for something I can find for free on the internet. Switching back to lose it."
1221,1221,2,2018-11-30T16:27:01.000Z,rexerr,Great but bugs and not regional to US,"I love the app for its design and UX but some things are hurting it. First it does not match my local time. As a diabetic this is not great as it ruins my data I use to track my blood sugar. Second, being in America the recipe are difficult because they are not converted to our standard measurements, making them not very useful. If these things could be addressed I would be really happy with it!"
1222,1222,2,2019-01-03T01:33:41.000Z,Jsm1198,"Great interface, terrible food library","I really like the app interface and the feedback it provides based on food entries.  But the food library is terribly inaccurate.  Even when scanning barcodes, most entries do not match nutritional information on the food labels.  Yes, users can update library entries, but who has time to do that with every entry????  Not me.  Fix the library and I’ll give it another try."
1223,1223,1,2019-01-05T00:58:38.000Z,Native Code,Privacy policy makes me sick,"You charge people to use your service, and then use their data for marketing? What a joke. There is no reason to have to “opt out” if it’s a paid service. What’s more if you valued your customers you would have a straight forward bullet point statement of what you collect, what you do with it, and how you protect the customer. Having to waste 10-15 minutes reading what you “are not obligated to obtain consent” about is soulless corporate crap."
1224,1224,5,2019-01-11T23:26:43.000Z,Kabdbtioakjnebb,Love the app,"Helps me lose weight by keeping track of my calories and giving me helpful hints along the way. Try it for a month and see how well you can do. It’s not easy, but you’ll be proud of yourself for doing it."
1225,1225,3,2019-01-21T02:54:07.000Z,Little boo boo 👍🏻,Plans won’t open- app quits,"I just added the Premium option for the Keto plan. When I hit plans, it goes to my home screen/app quits. Tried multiple trouble shooting steps- nothing. This is the whole purpose of paying for premium.  Disappointed.  The rest of the app is user friendly and well done. 3 stars and I’ll keep using it."

1227,1227,1,2019-02-20T06:58:42.000Z,Kfn1810,Doesn’t work anymore,I really liked this app and I even bought the premium version before 1 week. But since a few days I have problems with the app. At first I couldn’t log in and they said that my account doesn’t exist. I created a new account and now I can’t use the premium version anymore. When I want to buy it they say that I already have the premium for one year but then I still just have the basic account.
1228,1228,3,2019-02-24T05:08:10.000Z,lilcrunk,Limited on Apple Watch,"Biggest problem I have with this app is that they made it too fancy with breakfast lunch dinner and snack stuff, which it makes tracking more complicated. If they can tracking meals according to the time then life is much easier, for example if we eating from 5am- 11am that’s breakfast, after 12:00-4:00 that’s lunch. And after 5:00, is dinner."
1229,1229,2,2019-03-09T22:11:30.000Z,Thayris,"Try, try again","I used this app a few years ago and ended up getting annoyed because the food info (even the ones that were “verified by Lifesum” weren’t accurate. Since some time had passed I thought I’d give it another try. Nope. This could be an amazing app, but the inaccuracy in the food database is inexcusable. I spend more time trying to fix the data than I do adding data."

This only allows you to enter calories but if you are on Keto that doesn’t do you much good. This app also doesn’t have the feature to “build a meal” that would be great for items you repeat weekly.

1235,1235,4,2021-01-12T10:42:38.000Z,Cad.princess84,Great tracking app,I am really liking this app. I love how it remembers what you are previously instead of having to change the amount each day. One thing I would love to see in the app though would also be the net weight feature that MyPlate has.

On average that burns around 200 calories per day and requires extra hydration also. Currently I just have to remember to add 200 calories to my daily allowance, which then shows me as over on calories for the day."

The search function brings up obscure results, the measurements and calorie counts are never for average servings and I have to triple check every time I enter a food, very few recipes in the library, I’m so disappointed in this purchase.  I tried to get my money back and Apple said my purchase did not qualify for a refund.  DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY it’s a ripoff."

I’m not going to eat strictly from the designed plans every time at every meal so there needs to be a way to substitute options when needed and I couldn’t figure out how to make the app do that so that was very disappointing.

I’ve gained a small amount of weight back but I can’t find any app that has diet plans with the type of portions we need.

If they had this one thing they’d get nothing less than 5 stars from me.  Maybe in time they will provide this.  If not, I don’t know if I’ll stay premium."

I thought it would actually give me a meal plan and what to eat and recipes for how to make it. If I wanted to simply track my food I would have stuck with MyFitnessPal since it’s been around forever and many foods are already logged in there."

I am trying to eat around 300 to 500 calories more than I burn each day, but this function is hard to track with this app. It should include a feature allowing you to see your caloric surplus."

1253,1253,5,2019-08-13T13:32:17.000Z,Fix the app PLEASE!!!!!!,Great app,Great app for beginners. Helps to keep on track and stay motivated for first time keto dieters. Diet guidelines are very effective. I started Keto Burn last Tuesday and am I week I’ve already lost 7 lbs without exercising. This has been the most successful diet I’ve ever used and I’m never hungry.
1254,1254,4,2020-05-11T14:39:04.000Z,notyoMommasNickname,Good app,This app is very easy to use. I just wish i could add the macronutrient breakdown to foods that I add to my Diary rather than just the calories. I also wish there was an option to adjust my calories and macronutrient goals for times that I want to carb cycle. That would make this app perfect.

Don’t Be Fooled:  $48/year,"Unless you opt for an added cost subscription, i.e. $48/year, this diet app is nothing much more than a simple calorie counter.  Sure there are links to recipes but there are no “plans” or meal suggestions available in the “free” app.  Also, no way to plug-in your own food recipes for simple entry/selection for subsequent meals.  A much better choice for a truly free diet monitor/calorie counter would be MyFitnessPal."

Fitbit is listed as one of the health tracking apps that it can be synced to, but when I try to connect it I get an error message that says that Lifesum is not compatible with Fitbit. I’m not sure why Lifesum falsely advertised but it’s a shame because the app was very nice otherwise."

I would like a refund, but I attempted that through Apple(?) and they denied it. Thought I would try here. I’d be willing to pay a month, seeing I used it for a day. No other way to get a hold of anyone but to write a review. Thanks!"
1259,1259,2,2021-08-25T23:43:40.000Z,PhoenixFish,Not great,"It has an excellent database for foods and nicely organized with a pleasant interface. My biggest gripe is it doesn’t sync well with Fitbit and kept deleting my workouts so when I would go in to log my food, I had no calories left to eat because it kept deleting my exercise. I realized this after starving myself all day afyer having had two workouts. Do it yourself sensibly."
1260,1260,3,2018-08-15T15:08:58.000Z,SRMccar12329,Good app not as good,Looking up foods is harder in this app than other apps because the lists are not as extensively designed as other diet tracker apps. And the options for portion size are limited. I often use my fitness pal to really look up a food and the portion I need and then manually put it in this app. May stop using because of this.

My one big issue with this app is you can’t manually add macros for foods not in the database.....so any recipe I make I am out of luck. Super frustrating but overall a good app."

Would definitely benefit from some UX and QA expertise."

While on Keto you are suppose to count grams of carbs but minus the grams of fiber from your carbs which will give you your total “carbs”. Well this app does not subtract the grams of fiber from your carbs so the total carbs are WAY over your goal! It makes it so you deprive yourself from good carbs like veggies which you need in order to fuel, and it causes binging on bad carbs cuz the good carbs are so beyond lacking that you spiral out of control!"

1303,1303,1,2020-07-22T03:17:33.000Z,täbbÿ,Trick,"I hate this app I thought it was cool at first, but it took my money. I didn’t get to choose the plan and when I saw the plan it was $44 bucks that’s crazy for a app! And then when I tried to change it it already took my money, and I’m probably not gonna get it back. The app is not even worth it and I also thought it was gonna be  like a free 3 day or 7day trail but nope it just took my money don’t get this app there’s better ones out there ."
1304,1304,1,2020-03-11T20:16:12.000Z,brooke.k475,Cute but horrible,When I downloaded this app I was excited that I would get fit so I started making a plan then I finished and it would not let me do so until I paid I pressed no but I automatically charged me  and it is ridiculous that you can’t use the app if you don’t pay I do not recommend this app for anyone and if you are willing to pay keep in mind they charged me without approval and it is not letting me cancel
1305,1305,4,2019-10-29T03:09:50.000Z,stupid jerk head,Thank u,I have had thought that I should be more healthy but I never go through with it. I have been eating a lot of junk food and with this I’m trying to turn my self around and be more healthy and positive. So for that thank you and hopefully I can do this. : )

I’ve found other users have had similar issues; For me it worked for the first entry, then all the data was wiped from the Health app."
1307,1307,4,2019-07-24T23:49:16.000Z,Sup+56,Expensive,I really like this app a lot. I think it is helpful to see what food you eat is healthy or unhealthy. But I just wish you didn’t have to pay to just see why it is unhealthy or what is in the food. I wish they can make that less expensive.
1308,1308,3,2019-07-05T21:42:04.000Z,casey947,Beware macros,"I really, really want to love this app. The interface is nice, but the recipes + macros provided don’t match. I’ve been using the app for 4 days for keto. I have found 2 versions of the same recipe that are identical except the macros listed 🤷🏻‍♀️. I’m also able to swap recipes in and out w no bearing on my daily macros...it seems like there’f be some kind of ⚠️."
1309,1309,3,2019-06-30T05:29:40.000Z,Don't take this nickname,Some Major Bugs,"This app would be a 5 star if some of the bugs would get fixed. There is a bug that doesn’t allow you to update your goal after you reach it, and another bug that unsyncs the apple health data even when it says it is synced. These need to be fixed ASAP."
1310,1310,3,2017-12-23T09:01:48.000Z,TheStormTrooper,Won’t work on Apple Watch,Im liking the app so far but I can’t get the app for the apple watch to work. It just tells me that it needs me to sign in on my phone. I am signed in on my phone and I have signed out and back in. Im wondering if the developers know what going on. Nothing on the internet seems to help with this simple problem.
1311,1311,4,2018-04-06T15:51:04.000Z,Hot Venezuelan,Love this app,"Love this app. A couple suggestions : add restaurants like other apps. It would also be helpful to be able to take before and after pictures to see our progress. Also the print is really small and I do wear eyeglasses, still tiny."
1312,1312,2,2018-07-20T18:53:24.000Z,prettysmart95,not worth the purchase,"i really liked this app, until i purchased the premium version. i purchased the premium version because i liked the idea of it tracking my exercise automatically from my watch. but after several months the premium version has not worked consistently at all. i delete and re-download this app at least once a week to get the tracker to start working again. after contacting customer service they suggested that i refund my app before the refund period passed. doesn’t sound like they have any plans to fix this issue. so in short, great app. just don’t waste your money on the premium version."

The only thing that has me truly upset is that after I paid for a year’s worth of premium, if I try to choose a meal plan, the app crashes and I can’t see my meal plan. I need some sort of help because now I feel like my money is simply thrown away for a feature that I have no access to"

Good thing I could just use what I scanned the previous day. Also, I was adding a product that didn’t exist, but I still can’t find it even if I’ve tried to put it in the list 3 (!!!) times. Super annoying! I payed $30 for 6 months and I don’t feel that it was worth it at all... disappointed!"

1320,1320,5,2017-10-12T14:49:41.000Z,App_Man_105,Best app ever!,"I am not a premium member though I love this app! Something I like is that even if you don’t have a premium account to get some recipe recommendations! The one thing I suggest is, hide the recipes tab if you don’t have a premium account."
1321,1321,3,2019-01-05T07:37:24.000Z,Ceismommy,Okay,"I wish the app would allow users to add their own food with nutrition facts along with exercises and calorie loss.  Nutrition facts also doesn’t add correctly, I can eat the same breakfast as the day before but the protein and carb count is completely off.  There was also things on the app that was free before and now isn’t."
1322,1322,5,2019-02-25T00:57:46.000Z,Mrs Hawaii,Easy and keeps you fully aware,Great app! It keeps you in the know and accountable for your calories consumed and burned. My main suggestion is more options for food and excercise. Measure by reps and not just minutes.
1323,1323,3,2019-04-23T02:50:11.000Z,Musadolley,Crashing,"The app is constantly crashing upon clicking on plans category. I’ve deleted the app and re-downloaded it multiple times.

That’s gotta be fixed—especially if you’re gonna charge a subscription to use the app."

I would log my meals and get the straight face when it almost parallel the meals in the plan.  Most of my x’s would say “processed food”; well duh, there’s not a food you can pick up in the grocery store that isn’t processed in some way.  I wish I could get a refund on my yearly subscription."

I’m pretty upset because I selected that I wanted to gain weight so if I want to gain weight I’m probably going to be a bit below average. Other than that it probably would have been a good app."
1328,1328,4,2020-01-10T23:55:30.000Z,Holli07,Love it but wish it had recipe import,Love how easy this app is to use but wish it had a recipe import feature.  Whenever I input the nutrition values I get a poor food rating even though it is made with all Whole Foods.

In addition, I would like to maybe be able to ask a nutritionist or someone questions and get answers right away.

The database leaves much to be desired compared to MyFitnessPal."

However, there is glitch when attempting to add a recipe. This is really frustrating as I tend to make big meals for meal prep and have no idea what to put without the recipe option. Without the glitch I’d give it 5 stars, with I give it only 3, but I am rating it a 1 to get their attention."
1335,1335,2,2019-02-03T00:17:26.000Z,RudyroLav,Crashes randomly,Was pretty excited to use this but it keeps crashing on every other action. I logged out and now I can’t log in anymore telling there’s something wrong with my internet connection (which clearly is fine since I’m writing this review). I’ll keep it installed for a few days to see if an update comes through tho’.

I was stupid and bought a year subscription but I canceled it yesterday. I was hoping I could get a refund since they made me pay the $45 up front and not monthly like I thought. I used it for a week. And now I’m out $45 because of it.

1338,1338,4,2019-05-01T04:44:20.000Z,bookofswans,So far its great...but....,I’m enjoying this and possibly considering an upgrade but it doesn't have a widget and that would make it better for how I set up my phone. Similar apps are easier to use due to that feature. Sticking to free version for now.

1340,1340,1,2017-09-07T03:53:17.000Z,nielle,Why aren't the macros always customizable??,"The app is good, I much prefer the interface on Lifesum to that of MyFitnessPal. HOWEVER: for anyone following a specific diet, there is no macro customization, and it counts TOTAL CARBS. So if you're lchf you cannot set a specific carb limit on the two Keto plans. That leaves you to the Standard Diet which then doesn't account for the fact that fatty foods are healthy. This app is a waste of your time and money, do not pay for it."

I’ve tested this one out but I’m going to back to MyFitnessPal. Cool app, very creative but spent too much time trying to search for food I just ate even from chain restaurants."

It’s pleasing to the eye and separates my macros into meals according to my calories! But to find all those delicious recipes and connect to my fit bit, I would have to pay $$ that I really can’t afford! But still good! 💕"

They give me a “scale” and it frequently skips numbers. For instance, today I need 155p/180c/55f. But I had to put in 154p/181c/55f. This is often off by 4g or more!"
1344,1344,1,2019-01-01T22:50:39.000Z,Emsdot,Very limited,I’m an athlete and I track macros. I also have food allergies. I’ve used this app for three minutes and it’s completely unusable. I don’t need a plan with recipes because I don’t eat what everyone else can. I don’t want to upgrade to premium because you haven’t shown me the app is useful yet. I want a beautiful app with flexibility that puts MyFitnessPal to shame. You took all the unnecessary things from MFP and turned it into an app.
1345,1345,5,2019-01-21T12:52:50.000Z,Gram-Gram5,I luv it!,This app is spot on. It allows you to keep good track of what you’re eating.  The water part is the only drawback. You have no option of changing the amount-say to 12 oz. instead of 8.
1346,1346,1,2019-01-30T21:57:43.000Z,Taylor Williams 2019,Highly Deceptive Subscription Model,"I’m concerned about the legitimacy of the in-app subscription advertisement. The 12 month subscription was described as “$3.75 per month ... cancel anytime.” Immediately upon purchase I was charged $48 and my only cancellation option was effective January 30, 2020. False, or at best, misleading advertising like this should not be tolerated in the App Store. I’ve requested a full refund. At that time, I would happily give the unpaid version of the app 5-stars."

It’s been a few days and the lifesum app is way off when I compre it to my Fitbit calories burned and steps. It would be fine if it was even by 500 steps but they are differences of up to 4,000 steps. Is there anything I’m doing wrong?"

I do like the sad or smily faces on this app though because it makes me think twice about how I’m choosing to acquire my calories.
1349,1349,5,2021-08-21T16:53:34.000Z,HarvestMoon lover,Loving it so far.,I love the multiple built in diet plans. But can we have a auto fill coffee and creamer option? Coffee never changes I always drink the same amount just can’t be bothered to add it every day. 🤷🏻‍♀️

1358,1358,4,2019-07-17T15:20:41.000Z,MrsBobbyV,Good app- needs Apple Watch sync,So far I really like the app. I like how it tracks water consumption and you can change water cup size. So far it seems to have a good food database. I’d have given it 5 stars if it would sync to my Apple Watch and track activity.
1359,1359,3,2019-07-31T12:57:37.000Z,nicole331,Seems cool,"The paid subscription is tempting, but there should really be a free trial option. You get very few features without the subscription.

You can add the calories, but that’s it, and I have to redo it every single time. It’s very frustrating and I may get a different app for this reason."

The app basically doesn’t work. It shows every day only allowing 800 calories when my nutrition plan is 5:2 and should be 2200 cal and 600 cal. Also changing weight tells me I’m not the appropriate age and my height is stuck at 0’0”. Please correct all of these new bugs ASAP."

It needs to be accurate, because the Lifesum guide returns the favor with “accurate” critiques based on the food entered."

Telling people to not eat is NOT healthy. I find this app repugnant. The “Nutritional Advisor” said “when you befriend your hunger, you can lose weight without changing your lifestyle”. What??!! If this is really what you are telling people and saying it is healthy you should rethink your entire life."

The goals it sets are not clearly defined and potentially confusing. You have to read the fine print of the goals to actually know what you need to be doing (is it a maximum or minimal goal?).

Also all the measurements are in grams and so I have to constantly use a conversion calculator to make the recipes. Too inconvenient. I wish I could get my money back. Also you can’t add your own recipes and calculate the nutritional values.

1407,1407,5,2018-10-22T16:05:14.000Z,travellingtexan,Helpful,I love this app. It breaks down your macros and what you should be eating Caloric-wise for each meal. I also love the fact that it rates each meal giving you a smile or frown letting me know which meals or snacks keep me on track.

The app says 12+ I don’t think they should put it as 12+ if they are going to decide for me on if I’m old enough to eat healthy. And I’m not going to lie about my age because I wanted a true answer it’s not like I’m trying to starve myself I’m trying to cut out unnecessary sugar and I would like help remembering and tracking so I can look back and see improvement.

I tried it out but it doesn’t have enough recipes etc. It’s not great so I stopped using it then of course I get auto renewed for it. I realize many companies do this but it doesn’t make it any less sketchy. They say it’s more “convenient” for you - really all they hope for is exactly this - you’ll forget to cancel and they can take your money.

I have to double check everything I scan into the app because most of the foods in their database are extremely inaccurate. It would have really great potential if it didn’t have this major flaw.

I tried resetting my password but never got an email from Lifesum. I then sent an email to their customer service more than a week ago and haven’t heard back. There apparently is no number you can call so I’ve requested a refund with Apple.
1418,1418,1,2020-02-05T19:10:54.000Z,Mr. Poed,"Overpriced, underdeveloped",I tried the app and thought it was useful for a while. Typing in items and getting what I thought was a generally correct tabulation of nutrients and calories.  The more I used it the more random I realized the numbers were. I stopped using it and deleted from my phone. Then a year later they charge me $45 to renew per some fine print when I did the free trial.  They refuse to refund the money. Scam.

When you search for an item very random foods come up rather than common foods. The only way I can actually track my food is if I scan every barcode which is not practical. I requested a refund but of course they cannot help out.

1421,1421,1,2018-10-09T20:42:14.000Z,Nimblegreg,No way,I downloaded this app just so I could submit a review. Before downloading any app I always read the reviews and see how the developers respond. After reading the reviews and seeing how the developers responded to people arrogantly in my opinion I refuse to download an app where the developers blatantly tell people we’re just not gonna do that when it has been strongly requested by the users so bye-bye life sum you lost my money

1447,1447,3,2019-09-05T00:40:24.000Z,llama_walrus,Great idea but not so vegan inclusive,I like how the app is easy to use and how it tries to help you to form better habits.  However it doesn’t have very many vegan recipes which is very disappointing especially as a person new to veganism. I feel like this app could improve by including more vegan recipes.

I’ll just change it back. Nope! EVERY single time I try to change it, it just jumps back to 2106. That’s a whopping 500 cal MORE than even my maintenance calories! For weight loss I am supposed to be creating a deficit, but it just won’t let me. Starting to regret paying. Outrageous! 😡"

However, I already had a premium account and the settings wouldn’t sync.  After becoming frustrated with too many bugs in the software, I tried to cancel my account and had to go through Apple to do it.  The subscription model billing through iTunes is flawed and created unnecessary frustration."

1466,1466,2,2020-08-18T10:48:33.000Z,Egghead360,Not for everyone,So I went ahead and wasted $21 on this app. It restricts you too much and doesn’t allow you to create a plan that works best for you. The protein calculator is inaccurate. I am 200lbs and it was saying that 1.25 grams of protein per pound would be 130 grams. I thought I would be able make it my plan and get away from the MyFitnessPal pal cost. Guess I was wrong.

The app won’t sync with my watch and it’s always making errors when calculating calories. It’s small to complain about but spending money for something to always be broken can be frustrating.

Last night I cheated and had breaded chicken wings with ranch dressing and got a smile rating but when I have a healthy snack like a RX bar I get a gray sad face. Doesn’t make sense to me. I wish I hadn't paid for the whole year. Also I find it very time consuming and exhausting trying to come up with meals that will fit an equation that doesn’t make sense.

If I am cooking a whole meal for a few people (such as a soup) it would be nice to be able to save this recipe to track a serving as opposed to entering a portion of each ingredient

After using it for a few weeks I'm realizing how lacking in features and actual function the app is. It’s pretty but I really wish I could get my money back.
1522,1522,3,2018-10-27T13:40:31.000Z,Hfcjjggdfgjjjj,Pregnancy,I’ve always preferred this app over others until I became pregnant. It does not help me keep up with my information as a pregnant woman and not a regular person. Adding a feature like that would be very helpful. Can’t purchase premium without it unfortunately.

The app itself is fine but the happy faces and sad faces based on whether you ate something good or bad makes me feel a bit guilty when I indulge in a treat.  Since I typically make healthy choices, I don’t need to feel guilty when I do not.  Not sure I’ll continue using....."

1527,1527,3,2019-09-17T22:46:41.000Z,AILAPL,Missing so many foods,This app could be great but there are two things that really frustrate me. First thing is that if you make a lot of your own food you cannot create your own recipe. Second is that so many things are missing nutrition information.
1528,1528,3,2019-08-10T22:49:24.000Z,Lindsayjopersonal,It looks almost amazing...,"I can’t seem to change my meal plan without buying a subscription? I just feel like this app prioritizes the Keto diet too much. I love the simplicity of it and the foods that are calculated, but it’s kind of annoying not being able to change my meal plan."

1533,1533,1,2019-04-03T16:15:40.000Z,jmwith4k9s,Worst customer service ever!,I used to love the app. I paid for a year of premium status that went away after a month. I tried to contact the company several times and they just never answered. They completely ignored the fact that I was charged for a year and only used a month’s worth. Don’t buy their products if they can’t even support their own apps.

1543,1543,1,2020-11-01T14:25:17.000Z,Jlw6905,Inaccurate Nutritional Information and Serving Sizes,This app was really disappointing. I wanted it to be great! The recipes looked decent but every single thing I added didn’t make any sense. How would I possibly know how many grams of something I’m eating when I’m out and about. When I would try to switch to tablespoons or cups it would completely inaccurately change the calorie count.

Half of the foods they recommend aren’t keto friendly and have way too many carbs in them. I tested it and switched to Vegan bc that’s what my boyfriend is doing and they recommended meals with meat! Also, when you track food 8/10 the nutrient info is incorrect."
1549,1549,1,2019-09-13T13:05:06.000Z,Navy Planner,Bought Premium but keeps dropping it...,I have a premium subscription and every few hours the app how’s the banner at the top asking if it want to buy the subscription. When I go into my profile it says “free” but I clearly have a subscription. I have tried contacting support but the chat screen just hangs at the “bot collecting data...” prompt. When will I get my value here?

1551,1551,3,2018-09-01T01:23:39.000Z,La Dame de Monsoreau,Should offer a free Premium trial,Seems like a decent app that meets my needs. Though a lot of features are covered under Premium subscription. The shortest one it offers me is for 3 months. I wish there was an option for a free 30 days trial so I could really see what I’m buying.

My Fitness Pal lets you build a recipe and gives the nutrition info, I just went with the lower priced subscription so I could see my daily net carbs. If you want to adapt your own meals this app doesn’t work for that."

This app counts total carbs for your daily allowance instead of net carbs! What?!?! Even with the correct macro distribution, the carb intake is always over for me. For instance- hass avocado has 6gm of carbs and 5gm of fiber. Net carb is 1gm so that is what the app should count towards your daily carb allowance. But it doesn’t! Soooo disappointed!

So I have no idea which is correct and if I wasted my meals as a result. I requested a refund. Very disappointed.

1598,1598,1,2019-10-09T12:41:35.000Z,JT!80,Worst app I’ve ever paid for,"I’m truly flummoxed. How did this app get such good ratings? This app is nearly useless. I’ve used free tracker apps that have more features. It doesn’t even allocate the calories earned from exercise. I  purchased a 3 month premium subscription and canceled in the same day, though of course I’m stuck with it for 3 months. Spend your money on something more useful."
1599,1599,2,2019-07-11T01:23:19.000Z,Bjacobo4,Need to pay for full access!,Even to be able to use the bar scanner you need to pay for a subscription! The app looks great and works great but the fact that there are another apps completely free that offer more than this one just not as visually appealing made me give it a 2 star.

1601,1601,1,2018-02-07T02:47:19.000Z,theprofyte,Reduced features since update,"I've been using the app for over a year. Recent updates have stripped away features I was used to having. Specifically, Marcos pie chart for goals and actual intake for the day. This is now a premium feature... I'm disappointed to find the app trending toward either bloatware or overcharging for previously free features. It's a bit scummy for a business model"
1602,1602,3,2018-07-15T00:08:26.000Z,S/E/R,Importing issues,When I first started using this app it was fantastic and worked very well.  Recently it has started not reading activity data from the “health” app.  Is there a fix for this or will I need to find another tracking app?
1603,1603,5,2018-09-18T18:03:55.000Z,Anonymous Nischal,Great app,Can we add some pictures? Or drawings. I’m not paying so I’ll see how much it works out and if I reach halfway my goal maybe I’ll consider. But otherwise thank you great app.

The in-depth questionnaire to analyze your health goals in relation to where you are is a lovely touch. Tracking food and water intake and more is a breeze. Integration for Apple Watch? Excellent.
1608,1608,1,2021-01-27T13:24:59.000Z,donperreault,"The review nagging is disappointing, considering I paid.","Every day morning after launching Lifesum  application I am prompted to submit a review. I submitted a review at first and yet it continues to ask me day in and day out. I find this very annoying, considering I paid good money for the yearly subscription. If this continues, I will have to reevaluate which application I will use for food track and next year."

1611,1611,1,2019-04-17T22:00:01.000Z,Tweet0320,Used to be,Sadly I’m deleting the app. It used to be good at allowing you to adjust your macros all on the free app. You would just upgrade for a specific diet. I choice this app over myfitnesspal for that reason and it just over all seemed better put together but now the free version is pointless. Nothing but a calorie counter and I can get other apps to do more. Sad to see you go 😢
1612,1612,5,2020-01-20T23:42:36.000Z,familywall,Wonderful App!,"Easy to use. Worth the annual fee for the upgrade. Using it for 5:2 and it’s perfect. The emoji responses to food choices are great and I love that nothing gets a “bad” response, just neutral. Like 😐 instead of ☹️ or 😠."

For for many times in a day, I cannot start this app. It’s stuck at the splash screen. Often at a time I mostly want to look up nutrition or record down my intakes. What a bummer."
1616,1616,5,2020-01-08T19:24:15.000Z,Alsandoir,Review changed to 5 stars,"Awesome app, I had to update my settings. Very easy to use. Customer service was patient and walk me through the process."

So my calories are probably off by a lot, which isn’t great to say about a weight loss dieting app."
1618,1618,1,2019-10-11T01:38:25.000Z,mdobb,Premium does not include all meal plans listed,False advertising! Premium only includes meal plans for 4 of the daily suggested nutritional valves. Why would I purchase an app to spit out macros I can easily obtain online for free?!?! Do not purchase this app if you’re simply looking for something to generate meal plans tailored to your goals. This is only for those wanting to lose weight or try out a vegan diet for a week.
1619,1619,3,2019-06-17T16:29:46.000Z,Scmsmezzo,"Love the meal plans, but...",I haven’t used it very often as of yet but it looks like a good app. My biggest issue with it is that you can’t easily add your own recipes like you can in MyFitnessPal.
1620,1620,4,2018-04-15T15:59:17.000Z,mediterraenian max,Great Help,This app is great. It’s the only calorie counting app I’ve found that also helps me follow a Mediterranean Diet! I love the veggie and fruit trackers it as. I wish it has a tracker for alcohol that helped you keep yourself under so many drinks to help with weight loss
1621,1621,1,2018-04-27T20:01:36.000Z,Stephaanieex3,Very difficult to find food,"Even for large retailers like Trader Joe’s. I think more time should be spent making logging food easier. I find it a bit lazy to make the users in charge of the database, and as we can all see it isn’t working out. If other apps managed to do it I’m sure lifesum can too. And as I’m paying to use the app I think resources should be delegated to this."
1622,1622,1,2018-05-22T12:41:49.000Z,Stonerchicsrule,Be careful,The app says that your subscription is $2.99 a month which although is true is charged all at once!!! Which is confusing when using apps because we assume it’s per month and then you can cancel. Now I’m stuck again with an app that I won’t use probably!  Doesn’t even provide that many options for the price. Don’t buy
1623,1623,2,2018-09-20T19:10:00.000Z,OMD1225,Ugh,Seems like a cool app but there should be a free 30 day trial for the premium features. Tons of other apps out there you don’t have to pay for to see nutrition details. I need to see if I like the premium details before spending money on the feature. Wanted to love the app since I count my macros daily. What a let down.
1624,1624,5,2018-10-18T23:43:28.000Z,rennera,"Best App for Tracking Calories, Macros, etc...",The free version is great; gets the job done. The premium(I think $40/yr) customizes a plan for you and is super easy to follow. Very smooth and calming appearance to the app. Great download!
1625,1625,5,2018-10-26T20:10:51.000Z,Damo5000,Carbo loading goal needed,Good app but needs to have a goal option called Carbo Loading.
1626,1626,5,2018-12-30T17:25:11.000Z,Toby Brutus,Love LifeSum!,I find this app easy to use. Visually appealing and well designed. Responsive and quick to load.
1627,1627,3,2019-01-06T03:15:05.000Z,ifoundmyfitbit,Good,"1 suggestion:Maybe y’all can make it support logging recent,frequent,and be able to search for food in the Watch app."
1628,1628,1,2019-01-18T19:14:28.000Z,P-Wunder,Please Fix The Apple Watch Complication,Everything else about this app is great. But the Apple Watch complication does not update reliably. Even deep pressing the watch and pushing refresh does nothing for the complication. The only way I’ve found is to switch to a different complication and then switch back. I’m using Apple Watch Series 4 with the latest OS. Bottom right complication on the info graph modular face.
1629,1629,3,2019-03-22T18:18:14.000Z,Roseskywalkerrrrr,Worried,I’ve been experiencing a lot of glitches lately. I’m worried because I paid for a year long subscription and as of recently a lot of the features have not been working for me. I was in love with this app but it’s just been aggravating me as of late.
1630,1630,5,2017-09-18T05:02:34.000Z,Mashrur Khan,User friendly and visually appealing effective app,Helped me loose 16 kg over 1 year (from 89 kg to 73 kg) by religiously tracking food and workouts. Highly recommended for those who want to loose weight using a free app.
1631,1631,4,2018-03-16T03:11:42.000Z,Biglustypan,Decent App,Good decent app comparing to myfitnesspal. The UI is beautifully done and Easy to use. End up not using this because it doesn’t give me an options to display total carbs/protein/fat intake. Only show me how much I go over and not net gain.
1632,1632,5,2020-10-21T23:33:22.000Z,Mom’s-don’t touch,On Point!,This app makes it so easy to track
1633,1633,1,2021-07-02T16:46:53.000Z,Olyaraven,Useless,"So, if you’re on a smaller side and don’t have too much extra weight but just want to get rid of last couple of stubborn lbs and tone your body the app won’t let you put in your weight and set a goal. It won’t let you proceed and will demand to change your starting weight (meaning lie about it) and the goal, making it completely useless."
1634,1634,3,2020-11-07T02:13:13.000Z,AMN27,Missing important information,"The app is great, but it’s missing important information specially during these COVID-19 times."
1635,1635,3,2020-11-06T05:29:28.000Z,Phnina the first,It’s a good app,It’s a good app but the reason why I gave it 3 stars is because there isn’t an option to only pay once monthly..it only has 3 options for 12months 6months and 3months plans...at that point why not just charge the $50 to download the app instead 😒😒
1636,1636,4,2020-02-04T05:15:33.000Z,fryuryu,great app!,i’ve been using lifesum for 2 years and it’s going great. it’s very helpful for loosing weight and focusing on a diet. just got a gym membership too and this app has definitely helped me stay hydrated. however i’d like to see more options in dietary requirements. for example dairy free or gluten free instead of it only being an allergy. also the recipes they’re very helpful but i’m not able to get some stuff for the recipes i think there should be alternatives recommended.
1637,1637,3,2020-05-23T11:16:32.000Z,Ksulli81345,Great app with some bugs,The update my weight button that appears on the diary doesn’t seem to function right.  Maybe this is in a scenario when someone has gained weight not sure but it resets back to my old weight anytime I touch it
1638,1638,3,2020-04-23T12:42:55.000Z,r.rozzay,Annoyed,App isn’t working after an update from yesterday and exercise part needs an update but for the most part I like this app just wish they fixed the bugs it takes away from the app.
1639,1639,3,2020-02-04T20:40:45.000Z,Derek Arruda,App is good. But the lack of a single feature makes it unusable for me,"You only have 4 meals!!! I eat minimum 5 meals a day, maybe 7 some days depending on my plan for that day so I would like to just add more meals. The design of the app and its features are amazing but that’s a deal breaker for me."
1640,1640,3,2018-01-07T00:53:21.000Z,Precious163,It’s okay,"I love the concept, however the biggest drawbacks are the water intake calculator and the scanning. The water intake calculator does not allow me to adjust the size of the water bottle I’m using to track my intake. Additionally, the scanning feature isn’t properly scanning my food."

1674,1674,4,2018-12-05T17:06:37.000Z,jezizabo,Love it! Just started using it.,I love this App however it’s hard to know exactly what to eat to be “on track” I wish it had actual meal plans. Other than that it’s great. I just started so I’m not 100% familiar yet.
1675,1675,4,2018-12-13T14:25:26.000Z,Purpleranger MamaK,Awesome but,I would like complete control over the plan. Or add an Optavia plan or a 6 small meals plan. I like the accountably of my ratings but I can’t “rate” when I follow my plan.  Other than that truly one of the best trackers available.
1676,1676,3,2018-12-23T18:36:19.000Z,DuSTiX,Missing HealthKit integrations,"App is worthy of five stars, If only it had health kit in a integration. For example, I don’t understand why it can’t read body weight or water intake from health kit. My digital scale updates my weight every morning but I’m forced to input into app.  Only real flaw in app."
1677,1677,3,2019-01-01T15:31:00.000Z,Mariska369,Has potential to be great,"Easy to navigate (except food doesn’t have the Star to mark as fav), love the daily diary.  Hard to trust the food you add when building a meal. There are many different listings with vastly different nutritional info. That’s my main reason for 3 stars."
1678,1678,1,2019-01-10T23:55:02.000Z,Dave Sobin,Are you sure that’s what you meant? Please try a different number,"Ok so I got this app for my fitness goals, and apparently I can’t put my right height on the app! I’m 6’2” (around 6’2.5” actually) and I put 188 cm on my height. It asked me multiple times if I put the right number! It’s keep giving me this error! Either the devs can’t handle my height! Or the app just doesn’t work! Please fix"
1679,1679,5,2020-07-10T19:19:58.000Z,Spinnerlyless96,Love this app so much,"Literally the best app for people how have a hard time planning out meals. Super easy, convenient, and so affordable. Totally worth the the one time a year fee"
1680,1680,2,2018-03-10T00:07:33.000Z,Marita ;),Premium 😡,"This app is pretty good in general. However, there is SO little functionality without premium!!! You can't get recipes, see nutrients, take picture of food, see insights on anything! There are premium ad reminders EVERYWHERE! I'd rather have a full calorie tracker with ads than with premium and no ads. Come on, Lifesum!"
1681,1681,5,2018-07-20T19:53:26.000Z,Fireman Cox,New user,I really am enjoying Lifesum. It has been life changing thank you. I’m a career firefighter and I’ve struggled with eating right. But Lifesum has me taking back control of my life.
1682,1682,4,2018-11-17T18:33:22.000Z,chjjbvf,Rating,"I wish that the app would specify which foods contribute to carbs, fat etc. it tells you the rating of the overall meal, but I wish it would show Per food choice too."
1683,1683,1,2019-01-25T03:58:17.000Z,Kate Connell,Waste of money,"Save your $44 even the free version of myfitnesspal is way better, it’s user friendly and accurate. This app was more frustrating than helpful I gave it multiple tries after reading several reviews. But as someone who is dedicated to counting macros it was way more of a headache because of the layout and other pointless features."
1684,1684,4,2019-03-16T03:10:59.000Z,Crystalleyezedreams,Suggestion to add a vitamin section!,I love this app! Could I suggest a place to put in daily vitamins and supplements? Perhaps a daily checklist for them? I take gummy vitamins so they do have calories but I did not see anywhere to input them.
1685,1685,1,2020-06-19T03:44:43.000Z,Yourbabypimpmama,Garbage,They just want your money. Don’t download. It doesn’t even deserve one star. Doesn’t even have a free trial. You can’t look at the recipes either. You can’t set any goals. Basically useless. Doesn’t give you the opportunity to even see if you like the app without having to pay for a stupid subscription. Extremely disappointed.
1686,1686,4,2020-06-08T17:09:57.000Z,Tallahappy,Fix net carbs calculation,"Love the app for planning and tracking keto but app is adding fiber, sugar alcohols and sugar when it should be subtracting fiber and sugar alcohols from added and natural sugars. Either call it total carbs, but better would be to fix it to true net carbs."
1687,1687,1,2020-01-14T01:25:45.000Z,thisiskiki,You can’t get a refund!!,I literally bought the premium membership 5 minutes ago and I can’t get my money back. The features on this would be fine if I didn’t know what the hell I was doing concerning nutrition but that is not the case. I can not adjust the macros at all and that just doesn’t work for me. Thanks for making me throw $30 in the trash!
1688,1688,4,2020-01-07T04:28:33.000Z,redbullgiveyoulegs,Needs a widget and a trail period,The design is so much better than MFP!! Lovely app and easier to use with less lag than MFP too.
1689,1689,1,2019-06-29T16:10:15.000Z,Caged.canary,Judgmental,"This app judges everything that you do. Didn’t eat often enough? You’re clearly hangry. You couldn’t be intermittent fasting. Ate something it deems unhealthy? It gives you a little sad face. Up in weight a bit? It gives you a condescending pep talk. Thanks, that’s just what I didn’t need. I know what’s healthy and what isn’t, I just needed a calorie counter, not the heaps of guilt that came with it."
1690,1690,4,2018-01-30T03:31:02.000Z,ystian,Read weight and body fat from apple health,Can you read weight measurements and body fat data from apple health? This way we can Auto track and sync data.
1691,1691,3,2018-03-02T01:24:58.000Z,Nickalo3899,Frustrating!!,It’s a great app but it crashes constantly! I will give the developers credit for trying to fix the problems. Hope they can get it running smoothly! Like I said before... it’s a great app and it offers lots of great tips!
1692,1692,5,2020-03-05T21:01:50.000Z,Bemder,Amazing results,"I’ve lost so much weight, my mind is right when I’m able to neatly organize all my drinks and food consumption. I just love this app!"
1693,1693,1,2021-01-03T05:11:23.000Z,Sflowers21,Sneaky with charges,It’s really my own fault for not being more mindful. But I deleted the app long ago....and just got a charge to my account for “premium”. I forgot I signed up on their website so it wasn’t on my radar in the subscription section of the apple play store. Wish I would’ve saved my money and never subscribed in the first place.
1694,1694,2,2020-09-26T00:19:06.000Z,unahu2025,Paid no access,I purchased the premium 12 month membership .. Apple took my money app only gives me the basic options and keeps trying to sell me the premium package again. I will be canceling the membership  and using the basic options only
1695,1695,2,2020-09-21T04:49:35.000Z,Markus Weldon,Keeps crashing and closing app!,When adding or editing food entry’s the app constantly freezes and closes out. This is basic use and should function for the premium paid.
1696,1696,3,2020-07-23T15:44:04.000Z,Red Rozy,Too many details to lig,Great app! Lots of good info - I lead a busy life and haven’t had the tome to do the test or really look at the whole app
1697,1697,3,2020-06-21T22:53:46.000Z,ENDWARO7,Annoying,Can you please stop the app from changing the day I’m inputting foods for? It is annoying to log an entire meal to fine detail just to find out it auto changed to “today” rather than the day I initially starred logging food to.
1698,1698,2,2020-04-14T19:48:07.000Z,helioseres,Weight tracker resets your entries!! Beyond frustrating,"Yes, the app is sleek with features that would be cool if they worked properly. Every few days or so, the app resets the weight entered. It’s so frustrating as whatever you did enter is erased, plus the weight tracking graph is totally thrown off. I won’t be using this app anymore."
1699,1699,2,2020-03-15T20:52:29.000Z,Beblake12,Unimpressed,I got this app mostly for the meal plans but unfortunately there’s absolutely NO OPTION to remove certain items if you’ve got dietary restrictions. For myself it was extremely inconvenient.. I have celiacs disease and am highly lactose intolerant..
1700,1700,3,2018-02-19T19:18:21.000Z,r0ckstarr83,Just started but confused,"So...i liked the app and decided to upgrade, especially for the FitBit tracking my steps.  However, even with it connected and synced, it still says I have taken zero steps.  Am I doing something wrong?"
1701,1701,3,2018-02-23T22:58:14.000Z,up105,Wish the food database were better,"When I type in something like “spinach salad” I get a zillion results that are pretty unrelated, or show like 1 oz of raw spinach which isn’t helpful. That’s a pretty important feature but is an obstacle to me using this app more often"

1703,1703,3,2018-06-14T02:01:21.000Z,MariaSoledadMedina,Not counting steps,"The app is having problems synching the steps from the health app. I don’t know how many times I’ve reseted both apps, the settings and deleted and downloaded the app again. None of the calories I burn throughout the day are displayed 🙄"
1704,1704,4,2019-05-21T16:08:29.000Z,Nora Spell,Love it!!,Great app! Only downside is their food database isn’t as extensive as more popular apps such as my fitness pal. But it also has many more functions in the free/paid version compared to my fitness pal.
1705,1705,5,2020-02-22T19:27:57.000Z,mmoomi,Fix it,This app used to be good but since the update it won’t show how much calories burned when I put in my exercises.
1706,1706,1,2020-01-28T09:53:55.000Z,ScottytheMenace,so sick of shady developers,I wish one—JUST ONE—developer would be honest and respectful enough to tell users which features are free and which are paid BEFORE I DOWNLOAD THE FREAKING APP!!!
1707,1707,2,2020-01-02T03:33:38.000Z,phxpaul,Horrible restaurant data,"I have had little luck getting this app to log restaurant meals. With Competing apps, it’s almost like the entire menu is in the database. Not LifeSum. Very sorry that I did the 1 year subscription. I have already gone in and pulled the renewal"
1708,1708,1,2019-11-20T15:08:45.000Z,Kristenjf,Disappointing & No Free Trial,"I got this app based on all the good reviews. It is not intuitive and the number of recipes is minimal for what you are paying. The worst part for me is since there wasn’t a free trial of the premium, I signed up hoping it would give me access to more recipes and tools. Overall disappointing and now I am out $21 after only a week of using it."
1709,1709,2,2019-09-11T18:35:46.000Z,tcoyne89,Still No Way to track Vitamin Intake,"Decent app, but considering I paid for it and to date, to my knowledge it still has no way to track vitamins, I think this was money wasted."

1711,1711,5,2017-12-31T09:27:49.000Z,Salmakki,I love this apppppppp my fav BUT,I love this app however after I updated the water intake and the fish intake disappeared and when I checked the sitting it’s ON but I can not see it !!!!!!!!!!!! Please please fix it
1712,1712,5,2019-10-12T16:38:08.000Z,Vicavica42,Super helpful,The app really helps me keep track of everything consumed through the day. I’ve lost over 25lb thanks to the app!

1714,1714,3,2021-04-12T10:11:03.000Z,LauraLatour,Ounces are an issue,"The app is pretty good, but a lot of the food is listed in ounces, which makes it too difficult to track your food intake. Do you know how much 1.8 ounces of popcorn is? Also, too much variance of size and calories with the same food."
1715,1715,4,2021-03-01T04:44:49.000Z,notanotherusernane,Could be better,I think the recipes are lacking and could be improved

1718,1718,1,2020-05-01T15:27:13.000Z,hopiemv,WASTE OF MONEY,I have had continuous problems with the app not working properly or not letting me use premium features despite paying TWICE and the money pulling from my bank account. Support did not help me. I want this app to work so badly it has such potential but it’s been over a year and I give up. back to the ugly my fitness pal app at least it will work.
1719,1719,5,2019-09-01T16:15:06.000Z,🍜🌯🍝🌮🥫🥙🥘🍖🥗🍕,Lifesum is a good motivator,This app has made me more conscious of what I’m putting into my body. I’ve already lost 5 lb with just cutting out the snacking I was doing throughout the day!
1720,1720,2,2018-01-18T13:15:46.000Z,Yvette 94,Annoyed,I am too annoyed with the app to even try it. It is constantly asking me to update my weight every 2-3 days asking me if i have lost any weight. I put in my initial weight when I downloaded it 2 weeks ago but i dont weigh myself everyday so there is no reason to ask me so many times.
1721,1721,4,2018-01-23T14:45:23.000Z,Gregcheersykes,Good,Good app!
1722,1722,3,2018-06-12T11:02:17.000Z,vmv11,Not bad but needs improvement,Good for keeping track of stats and has a good list of foods.  Exercise options are sparse and I haven’t yet figured out if/how I can add foods to the list. They don’t seem to update correctly and the serving sizes are not captured accurately.
1723,1723,5,2018-07-27T02:48:20.000Z,FernandoAle34,Amazing App!,This app is a huge help for everyone who wishes to eat healthy without having to pull the calculator every time you're going to eat!.

1725,1725,2,2018-12-13T13:52:51.000Z,celty400,Beware metric measurements only!,"This is a beautiful app, appealing in many ways. Unfortunately, the usefulness of eating guidelines and recipes with measurements only in metric units is limited. Contacted the company and no setting for ounces et al. So good if this is native to you, otherwise need to convert or estimate...not likely to be my go to, sad after purchasing a year of premium access."

1727,1727,2,2019-04-01T20:13:10.000Z,Brandys Books,Tedious and terrible,There is so much crap to go through just to get to Where are you could use a diet plan which doesn’t really exist. You keep having this ad thrown up at you every other page that makes no sense whatsoever. I never did find a diet plan to help get set up
1728,1728,1,2019-05-06T16:01:57.000Z,My rap,Wouldn’t open,I just downloaded the app and tried to open it through Facebook. I was instead sent in a crazy circle of repeating pages trying to get me to log in. Nothing worked. There are far to many nutritional trackers out there for me to deal with a bug before I can even get the app opened. So I am moving onward with another app.
1729,1729,2,2019-06-02T14:12:38.000Z,I hate nicknames/passwords,Impossible to cancel membership,The app itself is useful for what it was designed to do but it seems virtually impossible to cancel my membership. Lifesum’s website tells me to cancel through my method of getting the membership (App Store or Lifesum App) and I’ve tried canceling using both and nothing.

1732,1732,1,2021-06-17T18:13:51.000Z,harmrmrmk,Annual charge despite cancelation,"I subscribed through their website foe a discount instead of through Apple. Big mistake. I thought the app was just OK when I used it for about six months. It was kind of a pain if you do lots of home cooking. So I canceled my subscription. However, yesterday they renewed my subscription at the full rate without any warning. Trash behavior!"
1733,1733,5,2020-09-03T13:34:53.000Z,NutELLAsaltines,Amazing,This app is so useful! I’ve struggled finding a program that tracks macros and water and exercise for free and this is exactly what I want. Highly recommended!
1734,1734,1,2021-01-22T11:05:54.000Z,madmomtwo,Nowhere to cancel subscription,I’ve tried it for a bit but found it to be too much of a hassle as a mom of two. I want to cancel my subscription but can’t find anywhere to do it within the app or in the App Store. I hate feeling trapped like this. If it’s easy to sign up it should be easy to unsubscribe. Definitely don’t recommend

As soon as I log it into my diary it gets deleted! Up until this point I have been so happy with it so I hope it gets fixed soon :(

1741,1741,1,2019-03-13T12:49:35.000Z,26S_1995,Waste of money,This app isn’t nearly as helpful as it should be given the cost.  I have used a few other macro tracking apps and I’m unsure as to what I paid extra money for with this one.  It’s difficult to find foods even when you search them by their very specific names.  Do yourself a favor and use MyFitnessPal or MyNetDiary instead.
1742,1742,1,2019-03-18T00:40:22.000Z,Grannnd,Hard to read font,Perhaps this wasn’t made for boomers’ eyes. It is impossible to see the font. I don’t see a way to make the background darker so I can see the white lettering. This is so frustrating because I paid for a year subscription. Tried to get a refund immediately after installing. iTunes doesn’t allow cancellation. Ugh!!!
1743,1743,1,2019-04-03T05:51:29.000Z,Megami76,Terrible App,"I wish someone would have wrote in the description that this was more euro-centric in both lexicon and recipes. I did not connect well with this app at all. It was so simplistic for the price to need to pay, and I was not impressed by the content. I’ve seen better weight loss and health trackers (Noom). I deleted this app. Wish I could get my money back."

1746,1746,5,2019-12-14T12:34:34.000Z,Kay3393,Great feedback,I really like how this app is interactive. LifeSum is like having a friend who talks to you about the choices you make or are about to make....

I thought I would give it another shot but once again it’s doing the same thing. I try to open the app and it won’t load through.

1752,1752,1,2018-11-26T15:34:40.000Z,jsjsnabshs,Not what I expected,I didn’t realize this was a UK app. I can’t find the names of typical foods and you can’t adjust the portions as you can in many apps. If a standard meat portion in this app is 3oz you can’t adjust to 4oz as you can in many other apps. Unfortunately I paid for 3 months but it’s fairly useless for me. Hard to track things like milk with 1% milk and 1 sugar etc.

1758,1758,2,2021-02-23T12:40:17.000Z,Narbua,Pretty but inaccurate,The interface is pretty and easy to use but its database isn't accurate. I've been using Lifesum for two days and have already reported multiple foods (including verified options) for incorrect nutritional information. I wish I hadn't paid for premium.

I was hoping for a way to enter quick  basic food information from my Apple Watch so that I didn’t have to keep picking up my phone and entering the information there. I saw the screenshots and it looked like I might be able to do that, but I can’t."

If you don’t click something, you can’t continue the test. Ridiculous. Then there are serious issues setting start weight and goal weight. Seems a little bit important.  Loaded and reloaded. No help. I’m done."
1763,1763,5,2020-05-20T20:25:13.000Z,Anonymous_rnslfbeo,Good app,This app has helped me start my own dieting plan. It has also allowed me to regulate my water intake along with helping reduce my bloating and maintain a weight that is manageable for me.
1764,1764,4,2020-06-20T02:16:28.000Z,AlyssaJean325,Please make maternity friendly.,Love the app but i wish their was a setting for pregnant women. I’m always “overeating” but i actually need an extra 400 calories and more protein everyday. That would be a really cool update.

Every time you turn around, they’re pushing their premium service at you. I guess that’s the only way to make this app work. No thanks, back to MyFitnessPal."
1768,1768,3,2019-09-03T17:35:18.000Z,Jaimeb818,Great but needs more features,There app has been easy to use for the most part. It would get 5 stars if there was a recipe builder where you could put in your own ingredients to make a recipe with the total macros calculated.

1775,1775,4,2019-01-02T06:08:10.000Z,Junaid76,Good but...,It is a very beautiful app but it’s very annoying that you always give add about premium. You can’t do anything if you don’t go premium which is very annoying.

1778,1778,1,2019-02-25T14:22:21.000Z,kitebarbie,Have to pay for EVERYTHING,"Although this app is free to get, you can’t really use it unless you pay for premium or buy one of their plans. Without proven results or at least providing a free trial period, I’m not paying for something I am not certain works well. Too bad bc it is a well laid out app, but useless and proves to be yet another fishing app without a free trial."

1792,1792,4,2019-02-08T07:01:14.000Z,sse06239,Great App!,Overall great so far. Hope there is a way to customize calorie goal and the percentage of those three: carb fat and protein. And also create own shopping list without following the diet.

It’s so frustrating when you get an app and then find out after you get it that it’s out of sight on costs. If your not trying to trick us just put the price on the app before I download it...Geez

I also dislike that it does not give me the option to choose how many calories i would like to consume a day.

1848,1848,2,2020-04-07T20:02:10.000Z,Lord Poo,Confused,"How does this app calculate the macronutrient breakdowns? I’m 105 pounds, 5’4”, on the classic/maintain weight plan, and the app says that I should be consuming 93g of protein a day? 🧐 That seems like a ton, especially since I don’t eat meat... some more transparency on this would be helpful. I don’t want to lose weight/diet either."
1849,1849,4,2020-03-25T21:17:37.000Z,Serenity1177,Amazing,This app is amazing. But it’s hard to track down exercises that you can’t search up in the app. So just a little constructive criticism. Thank you though.

So now it has my name, Birthday, email, password and God only knows where it went! There should never be an app you can’t delete if you no longer want it! Wth?!? This internet grave stealing info is getting old af!!"

All in all this app is terrible for dieting because you can’t customize it for your needs"
1853,1853,2,2018-10-01T19:01:03.000Z,chandini,Pretty But Greedy,The app is beautiful but you need to be a premium member to actually get full use of the app. I downloaded this to see the recipes and when I found out you need to pay I deleted it. I can log my calories with MyFitnessPal. It's is way better y'all. It works and it's free.
1854,1854,1,2018-10-28T22:26:54.000Z,MamaBear2710,Cute interface but actually kind of depressing,"The little happy faces are less on the side of encouraging and more on the side of shaming. I am proud of myself for eating any amount of food at all as this is a challenge for me, and the judgey little less than happy face makes me not want to use this at all. Going back to a more minimalistic interface like MyPlate."

But as I switch to iPhone XS, this app just can’t stop quitting and quitting so I have to uninstall it and change to other diet tracker apps. Other than this huge con, the features and the design are amazing. But I can only give it a one star cuz I can’t use it now."

I was looking forward to being able to use the app but now I just regret it.

Hard to give up something that just works like myfitnesspal for sparkly shiny circle graphics. Substance isn't here. Waste of time, and it's $44 to set up macros. On the plus side great app for fools and imbeciles."

The Apple Watch complications don’t sync correctly unless the app is also open on the iPhone at the same time...which is pointless.

1874,1874,2,2018-04-15T01:43:15.000Z,Please1215,Uninstalled after they charged for macro goal changes,Great app until they decided to get greedy and charge customers to edit their macro goals. Very disappointed. A monthly charge is not how I would like to keep track of my macros...switched to a pay one time app.
1875,1875,5,2018-07-12T18:53:09.000Z,jujubeanez,This App gets two thumbs up,This app is amazing I’m learning so much about food. It feels like I have a personal nutritionist all day with me.

This app would be great if I could trust that everything I’m logging stays logged and could believe the calorie/macro stats at the top without going back and double checking every meal every time I open it.
1878,1878,4,2018-09-01T16:25:22.000Z,JMA47,Tracking,I like the app.  It’s easy to use.   I do find the daily reminders to weigh in annoying.   Trainers are always telling you not to weigh daily it’s about inches not pounds
1879,1879,1,2019-02-12T14:42:39.000Z,Both thumbs down!,Meh,"Great app actually, but the prices for premium are ridiculous to me. It’s hard enough fir some people to afford a gym membership and then we have apps like these whom charge an arm and a leg to help track stuff. It just isn’t worth it in my eyes. I understand y’all have to make a living and profit as well it just shouldn’t be a killing to others."

1882,1882,2,2021-08-19T13:32:23.000Z,Babagaga123,So so,App does not have extensive calories information. Some of the calories are off a bit and the recommended calories to loose weight seems to be more than what other trackers would suggest. A bit misleading and not good for losing weight.

I’m not really sure why I’m giving it two stars- probably because I never tried to use the content you have to pay for so I don’t know the whole of the app."

1886,1886,1,2020-05-03T01:12:21.000Z,ENBDW,So frustrating!,"I got this app two weeks ago. Its very pretty. But it doesn’t track well, doesnt sync and is incredibly frustrating. Today, i tracked my water 3 times. I opened it just now and of course, its not there! Same with vegetables and my fitbit. I’ve look at tech support and none of it helps. What a waste of money."

1913,1913,1,2018-07-23T23:43:57.000Z,Kristinnnnnnnnnnn,Too expensive.,"This app is easy to use and has great aesthetics but won’t give you access to important things such as grams of fiber, sugar and sodium without you paying for Premium. If premium were $10 a year I’d pay for it, but $50 is expensive as hell for an app. Insane that there are no good free or reasonably priced macro tracking apps anymore."

1925,1925,5,2020-05-12T14:28:17.000Z,Baileyhood54,Great app,"This app is amazing!! I love that you can track everything from water to calories, carbs, proteins and all that good stuff!!"
1926,1926,2,2020-12-14T07:05:09.000Z,ajhqt,"No way to log food on the web, pathetic water tracking","The fact you cannot log food over the web and the inadequacy of the water tracking (two set sizes, and no way to add just a # of ounces?) is pretty ridiculous."
1927,1927,1,2020-07-22T01:45:20.000Z,TheaterCrazy,Problem with portion sizes.,"Hi, I’d like to get my money back. I use tablespoons for pecans/peanuts etc"
1928,1928,4,2020-05-16T00:26:53.000Z,DevinC2205,Great but needs more free features,This app is great but please let us see more of our food macros for free. You shouldn’t have to pay to know what nutrition facts are in your food.
1929,1929,1,2020-04-21T19:24:04.000Z,Mr.Jaxson,Great at first,"I purchased the 3 month premium subscription and the first few days went well. Then after a few days for some reason the app stop allowing me to add my food. Every time I add something it immediately disappears, making the app useless. Unless this gets fixed then idk what I am going to do."
1930,1930,3,2019-01-16T01:07:24.000Z,shaneeeeeeere97,Good but pricey,Everything more than just food tracking on the app requires a monthly membership - I would just stick to Under Armours app as it has better value.
1931,1931,1,2019-03-24T14:28:11.000Z,Alexiss Adams,Not worth the money,"Do not get premium. It basically does what the free version will do for you. The app glitches all the time, has limited results for daily food options, and i rarely use it because it is frustrating and rarely helpful for a healthy lifestyle. Would give 0 stars if I could."
1932,1932,1,2019-03-28T02:55:11.000Z,customeriPhone,Refund,"I have selected a monthly plan but has been charged for whole year. I have cancelled the subscription and did not get a refund back. It took time to find the e-mail to contact Lifesum. After I sent an email, I got a reply that the replies are very slow as Lifesum got lots of emails. Refund is still nit resolved."
1933,1933,5,2019-11-02T15:23:25.000Z,AuraliDi,I am actually obssess with this App,"It connects to mu apple watch and has almost all the brands that I eat, and I am realizing I eat a lot of junk 😂"
1934,1934,1,2020-01-02T13:13:45.000Z,Vayta,Needs to be updated ASAP,Wasn’t able to even log into app because my weight is too high kept asking me was I sure and to change the number like what I Weigh I would lie about especially being the number that it is could definitely be unmotivated if my skin wasn’t thick.
1935,1935,3,2019-11-07T15:05:29.000Z,brenna siler,It’s just ok,I think it could be better I feel like I’m over eating because the app told me I needed more calories. And I’ve gained wait instead of lost it would seriously like improvement
1936,1936,1,2019-09-17T17:36:10.000Z,ebonibianca,Useless Nutrient Info,"I was sorely disappointed in this app. Aesthetically it is beautiful. However, scanning a barcode could not even bring up correct information. Isn’t that the main purpose of the app? To track calories and what not? Wish I could get the money back that I paid for premium."
1937,1937,1,2019-08-19T22:08:09.000Z,Riggsy boi,"Nice looking app, very misleading program!","I was recommended this app from a friend, took the assessment and wanted a vegan diet plan that was clean eating, it kept choosing plans that recommended to incorporate meat and also when I went to go look at meals for the week, it wanted me to figure everything out and track it myself."
1938,1938,1,2019-07-10T15:03:47.000Z,MinSeattle,Don’t waste your time or money,This app crashes constantly. When I emailed the company for advice the gave none. Not worth the time or money. Which is a shame because this app was exactly what I was looking for. Advice to the company: work on your customer service and you could have saved a customer.
1939,1939,2,2019-06-29T21:49:27.000Z,sydney_summer__,Not great if you only have free version,"I got this app to count my macros and calories, but ever since I’ve downloaded it I’ve been very agitated at the fact that everything the app advertises as its features are all in the premium version, which is expensive."
1940,1940,3,2018-01-05T02:19:01.000Z,WhyDoIHaveToChooseANickname???,Good but not worth money,"Too little food data, especially for a paid app. Also needs to read out body metrics from healthkit instead of forcing manual entry each time."
1941,1941,2,2018-03-28T04:07:52.000Z,Lilililililululikililililil,Loved the app at first!,"It was a great app, I even started to like it more than MyFitnessPal but then they stared charging for a lot of their features. For instance you can’t adjust the macros settings unless you want to be charged monthly, which kind of defeats the point if you ask me."
1942,1942,5,2018-06-20T21:05:29.000Z,D Speaks,The friendly diet app,I like the gently encouraging messages and the calorie counting is great! My first healthy lifestyle app and it’s working great to help me track my intake and exercise.
1943,1943,3,2018-06-28T18:37:01.000Z,flwrgirls,Weird Workout,It’s good but tracking the workouts is weird why use time instead of the number you do of the workouts. Plus not all workouts are in the category.
1944,1944,5,2018-10-27T16:19:24.000Z,nimi20,Go lifesum,I love Lifesum because it helps you lose weight and  get fit and it really works and helps me a lot.
1945,1945,4,2018-11-23T15:41:39.000Z,ThinkSecret,So far so good,Excellent for calorie counting and really monitoring and controlling macros. Needs a bit more flexibility to be able to add meals. Restricting the app to 3 meals and 1 snack compromises its ability to diet plan and meal prep. Other than that good app.
1946,1946,5,2019-01-03T13:09:31.000Z,Gilbert 161,Fonts and colors,I’m 49 and love the app but on an iPhone it’s hard to read because of color contrast and font size!
1947,1947,5,2020-09-17T14:06:08.000Z,Hero of Elements,Love it just needs 1 thing..,Health app integration... it reads the water part but you can’t export any of the other dietary info.
1948,1948,2,2020-10-17T17:57:15.000Z,Morgan Carlile,Good potential but...,Excellent tracking system but the visualizations on the “daily progress” screen for previous days are completely inaccurate. I’m very disappointed for this expensive subscription.
1949,1949,1,2020-10-05T10:44:54.000Z,milobernard82648293,Measurements don’t save,What an awful ap. Measurement adjustments often don’t save and sometimes I don’t notice until the end of the day when I’ve over or under eaten. You’d think a small kink like that could get fixed. Very small issue that makes a HUGE difference when tracking macros.
1950,1950,5,2019-10-21T12:51:05.000Z,BeautyOhh,The app for keto,"This app has made the keto diet so easy for me! Helps me track my carb and fat intake. Also I barley drink water, and when i do. This app encourages me to do so!"
1951,1951,2,2020-08-16T15:09:04.000Z,heyjrob,Features to improve,"Please, there are 2 main features that you need to improve with this app:"
1952,1952,1,2020-08-04T02:29:54.000Z,Rhunae,Bought the premium but cannot get the features,I bought the premium and it will not give me the premium features. I have tried everything the support page has said to do and nothing works. So I deleted my subscription and will be deleting the app.
1953,1953,1,2020-04-21T03:58:15.000Z,Newuser24543,Lots of bugs,This app has lots of bugs. Calendar view shows a number of days as green that should be red and the view that shows calorie graph per day has missing days even though I entered food for those days.  Very disappointing because it’s demotivating not to see your real progress.
1954,1954,2,2020-02-10T21:22:58.000Z,Leathersoul,Fancy Recipes....NO TIME!,"I don’t have much time to put these lovely picturesque meals together. I only have time to shove meal components that can equate to a decent meal. Wish there was a pop that said,”Need Ideas for simple fast lunch?” Click it you get suggestion like egg salad or peanut-butter and apples, slice of cheese, etc. components."
1955,1955,5,2019-09-24T11:44:29.000Z,Bugs R,Life sum,I love the apps and I want to buy the app but why a  monthly prescription needed I just like apps that I can purchase and that’s it lol  like dark sky lol
1956,1956,4,2019-09-28T19:07:53.000Z,Cherry🌹,Y’all charge me extra,"I just purchase the promotional price which is $30 but y’all change me the full $44, can I get my money back please and thank u 😬"
1957,1957,5,2019-08-13T13:58:37.000Z,Hcundbcj,GREAT APP,lifesum really helps me stick to my goals and lose some weight along the way. highly recommend
1958,1958,4,2019-09-24T01:37:26.000Z,shineeangee,So much more potential,"This app is great. I paid for the subscription almost right away. I’m enjoying it a lot so far. However, I think there’s so much more it could do."
1959,1959,5,2019-07-29T02:19:08.000Z,Lgiselle,Question?? Lost ...,Does it charge the full price or only charge per month. Quite confused
1960,1960,2,2018-04-26T21:38:13.000Z,MiseesMules,Sugar not taken into consideration,"This would have been the perfect app. I cannot use it because while protein, carbs and fats are important, the most important thing is controlling sugar. I wish I would have looked Into it further before buying the subscription."
1961,1961,3,2018-06-16T12:12:38.000Z,Bella brucie,Changing prices??? Why?,"I think this app is as beautiful as it is functional. That said, I looked at the premium pricing last night, coming in at $34 annually. This morning I go in to purchase and it’s $10 more. Not appreciated."
1962,1962,4,2018-07-26T15:18:55.000Z,Miss__natalieee,Nearly perfect,"I love the different plans tailored to my goals with recipes integrated into it. I’m on the intermittent fasting plan, and my only wish is to be able to modify my calorie goals. Great app!"

1964,1964,3,2018-09-14T14:14:13.000Z,adgkrehk,Measurements,NOT CONVERSION friendly!
1965,1965,1,2019-01-16T13:53:06.000Z,eriquebec,With new update I cannot add any recipes,"Every time I click to add more recipes the app turns off and sends me back to my home screen on my phone. I have liked using this app, though have only had for a short time and would really like to add more recipes so I can properly track my food! Thank you!"
1966,1966,5,2019-02-08T12:21:43.000Z,Natal-bug,Love it,Love it!! My life is getting back on track! Like if I forget to eat breakfast I feel bad when I submit that info into Lifesum.
1967,1967,5,2019-04-01T14:34:25.000Z,Chocolate Sun 69,It’s On!,I’m loving 🥰 this APP! It’s easy to follow. Graphics very pleasing to the eye. I like the breakdown of Carbs vs Fat vs Protein. Amazing 😉 I am so pleased with Lifesum I recommended this to a friend she signed up the same day!
1968,1968,1,2019-05-01T02:02:02.000Z,mkelmra,Not worth it,Accidentally subscribed to the yearlong membership. It was impossible to get a refund from Lifesum or Apple and I really couldn’t afford to pay $40+ for an app I never used. There are so many other apps that offer meal plans and health tracking for much more reasonable prices (or for free). Don’t waste your time with this one.
1969,1969,3,2019-05-01T12:49:33.000Z,knabuvuabubs,Not accurate,Does not have accurate information when it comes to a lot of products.
1970,1970,2,2018-01-11T23:59:27.000Z,ccstar1421,Should have read reviews first...,I paid for the premium and I’m still trying to figure out what I paid for. Same features I had with myfitness pal for free. Most frustrating thing...I can’t input my own recipes. Disappointed. Want my money back :(
1971,1971,2,2019-03-21T21:38:54.000Z,Maisy40,Latest update screwed up,I have really enjoyed this app but its latest update is not tracking burned calories and some of my favorite foods are missing. Also noticed that it’s not calculating the right amount of calories.
1972,1972,3,2019-03-22T15:34:12.000Z,marti_maraschino,A little help here..,"I purchased a year of premium membership on January 4, 2019. For some reason now I keep getting ads to go premium and can’t view the premium features anymore."

1974,1974,2,2020-11-25T00:49:21.000Z,Martinassffhj,Unreliable sync,The app has a great UI so far the best I've seen in the app store.

Y’all should be a little more up front about this!!..therefore y’all get 1 Star!"
1976,1976,1,2020-07-18T10:59:29.000Z,alephgimmell,Won’t load,"It won’t allow me beyond the terms and conditions. I thought perhaps I scrolled too fast and needed to scroll through slowly enough to actually read them? Nope. I tried restarting my phone. No dice. Every time I push “ok” to accept T&C, it looks like it’s going to load, but then just goes back to the T&C."
1977,1977,1,2020-06-05T23:02:49.000Z,hdunj,Annoying weight section,Every day when I go to enter my weight it goes back to square one (resets) and I have to manually decrease the weight by oz (you can’t type in your weight). I just had a baby so I lost like 30 pounds off the bat so it takes like 10 minutes just to add my weight in.
1978,1978,5,2019-09-15T03:06:39.000Z,Carebear1119,Best Keto app I have found!,I love how the app tells me if my meal is balanced. It has really helped me define my meals to get all the right macros. Worth the yearly subscription!
1979,1979,2,2020-04-02T20:53:44.000Z,Kskxinevehuebvsgsh,Still buggy,"Reverts weight to original weight, super frustrating.  Charts often don’t display.  Search for food doesn’t bring verified items to the top.  Verified food doesn’t match what’s on the label often, understating calories and servings."

1981,1981,1,2018-03-12T22:42:15.000Z,Dad Duncan,Waste of time and money,"This is with out a doubt the biggest waste of money and time yet from the Apple store. Charge a lot from the outset so only opt for one month until your sure you agree with me. Calories useless, exercise pointless, if you are as serious as I am about getting in shape spare yourself another iscam."

Turned into a bad, money hungry app."

I would mind if I had a chance to try it out first. But that's not an option and I'm not in the business of giving money away
1984,1984,1,2018-07-17T12:10:04.000Z,ValerieD312,Don’t bother,"I thought this app looked promising. Upon realizing you cannot access much without subscribing, I decided to give it a try. For the price you pay, you get VERY little. I was also extremely disappointed that the barcode scanner doesn’t work. I wish I could get my money back."

1987,1987,1,2019-01-05T20:54:47.000Z,PseudDaemonum,Offers weight loss options only,There aren’t any ‘diet plans’ for gaining weight and your stupid find your plan quiz asks what your goal is let’s you choose that you aim to gain weight and then the next question about your main problem all imply you’re overweight or you overeat instead of the inverse
1988,1988,5,2019-02-23T15:48:00.000Z,Abril4vfr,Lifesum,This app is the best it helps me know how many calories I have burn and since I am a gymnast i need to know what I am eating in daily basis
1989,1989,1,2021-02-23T12:41:25.000Z,En-go,Cool look needs work,I have used this app on off of the last few years. I finally decided to buckle down and pay the premium for the app. I’m really disappointed because the sync between my phone and iPad app hardly ever work and my watch complication never updates.

The app incorrectly states that chicken breast is 52% fat when google says that there are just 3.2 grams of fat per 100 grams of chicken breast.

Don’t recommend the upgrade can just search the internet for free to get a lot more structured and better information.
2006,2006,1,2019-10-09T14:44:38.000Z,nharv000,Upgrade,The free app is only good for using the diary… With every  Move within the free app the program encourages you to upgrade… If you want to look at the recipes upgrade if you want to look at your nutritional components upgrade if you want to do keto measures upgrade… Plan to delete program and look for another…

2014,2014,5,2018-11-08T16:01:07.000Z,HappyValerie,Super!,This app is exactly what I needed to know if I was eating too much or not enough or something!  Great job to the developers!!

You can’t buy half a tomato or a drop of soy sauce. Wasted my money on this app. Impossible to shop this way unless you like to throw out food and waste more money because of thus app."

The ideas are there, but most of the foods don't have the correct nutrition information. I ended up doing the calculations and recipes myself, except $50 short. Drop the price or do a better job."

I tried this app out around a year or so ago and had to give up due to so many bugs. After giving Lifsum another try, it’s clear nothing has changed."

The problem is I paid $45 for the premium plan and it never activated.  I cannot access any premium content and am directed to upgrade- which is Infuriating!  Also, I have had no response from customer service."

I don’t want anything but tracking and recipes... super disappointed that there’s no way to just get recipes with this"

2029,2029,1,2019-07-17T16:32:03.000Z,BosnianAJ01,Wrong nutrition info,Looks great to the eye  but that’s the only thing you’re going to get here nutrition information is wrong if you eat half of something it’s next to impossible to put it as half or decrease the cal intake. My fitness pal or lose it is just much simpler to edit sorry guys deff not coming back to this!
2030,2030,5,2018-07-19T16:00:57.000Z,SarvenazB,Calories,Some calories (for example for cherries) are not accurate.

2032,2032,1,2018-08-18T21:37:47.000Z,Locogreen915,Judged me on my goal weight,I tried to insert my goal weight and it would not let me continue because it said my BMI was too low. I felt very judged....by an app. I’m essentially skinny fat so who’s for this app to say I shouldn’t lose weight.  BMI is not a good judge of a healthy weight. It’s an approximation so why not let me input my goal weight? Deleted the app.
2033,2033,1,2018-11-05T12:31:47.000Z,..........….………,Overpriced and not helpful,The meal suggestions are all very complicated and things I would never think to make even if I did have the time. Other than the meal plans there really isn’t much this app offers that you couldn’t find in a free app. No refunds for iTunes purchases so $30 wasted.
2034,2034,4,2019-01-02T01:45:15.000Z,Jackilayne,Nice,Would be nicer if we could enter in the barcode number if the camera can’t seem to scan a barcode.
2035,2035,3,2019-01-08T18:30:03.000Z,MDeter67,The premium banner,I love the app it works wonderful and is designed beautifully. The one thing that kills the look for me is the “Go Premium” banner that hangs over my head the whole time.
2036,2036,1,2019-02-01T23:02:29.000Z,Lewdduck,Misleading,"First off, my bad for not realizing it was a Keto Only app. I found a lot of their advice to not work for me as I can’t be on a Keto diet."

However, clicking on the plans tab causes the app to crash.  The app Carb Manager is a better Keto macros tracker especially if you take blood readings.  I was willing to pay for this just for the meal plans but instead I wasted $30."
2038,2038,1,2019-03-23T00:53:32.000Z,K95yle,Broken App,"This latest update crippled the app. I can’t tell if it’s an actual bug or if they stripped even more features from the basic plan. I used to have the premium plan, but since stopped as I have attained my fitness goals. This app USED TO BE excellent at helping with muscle gain, fat loss, etc., but now it’s a broken mess."

I bought this specifically because of the macro tracking for keto, and am hugely disappointed."

2043,2043,3,2021-04-26T00:14:25.000Z,ldrx3,Water measurements,I like everything about the app EXCEPT the fact that water is measured in ml no oz. That means that I have to keep track of my water all day and enter it in the evening. Most people don’t usually drink 8.45 oz per 8 oz glass.
2044,2044,5,2020-09-08T19:12:36.000Z,Louise1957,Itemized Nutrition Log,Lifesum is great and their customer service was prompt with helping me learn how to put in homemade items. Thank you!

2047,2047,1,2020-08-17T01:00:09.000Z,no thanks74,Not worth it,"Don’t buy the subscription that lures you in by talking about customized macros, recipe plans, etc. the macros are basically the same regardless of what you enter (I entered multiple weights and goals to see). And the recipe plans are ideas you can see online. They don’t plan out sample days for you, etc."
2048,2048,2,2020-04-10T05:57:00.000Z,xChasity,Pointless without paying for subscription,Very very very limited use without paying for subscription. There are other apps that can help you with their free version better than this one can.
2049,2049,2,2020-02-27T23:54:18.000Z,lizsmom,Too judgy,I was looking for an app to track my food. I wasn’t looking for a hard core diet. I found this app to be incredibly judgy. If you eat just a little too much or too little you get frowning faces looking at you when you open the app.
2050,2050,2,2019-04-23T00:07:29.000Z,BlueStitch666,Disappointed,"I don’t have the extra money to pay for premium, and the free version is no help whatsoever. I keep GAINING weight instead of losing it. I’m feeling even more hopeless/helpless than before, since it gives me no advice on how to eat better."
2051,2051,4,2019-05-05T21:08:03.000Z,vaa33,Ok nutrition app,Very large data base of foods and easy to use and appealing layout. I just wish that you could personally edit your goal macros.

But trying to synch it with my FitBit has been a total pain. It just errors out every time. I emailed the company a couple times and never heard back. I’ll be searching for a new app unfortunately."

2057,2057,1,2019-08-12T19:26:38.000Z,rufkap,Not free at all,They scam you to free option but you can’t go beyond log in it keeps you on the screen for picking premium PAID version without even option to try basic. You can’t escape or explore until you pay for premium subscription . Bad advertising

Also, the app doesn’t correctly calculate net carbs.  Also, it recommends steak and eggs even if you say you’re vegan."
2059,2059,1,2019-06-17T17:51:52.000Z,sandydaniel123,Bad,"The app won’t actually help you unless you pay for premium. It’s also telling me I should only eat 2 calories per meal?? It won’t let me change my goal to lose weight, it will only let my goal be to gain weight. So I’m definitely deleting this app because it really did nothing for me."

I restarted my phone but that didn’t work. I deleted the app and redos loaded it but that doesn’t work. It only opens to a green title screen and won’t do anything after that.

One is called ketogenic easy and it allows 100 net carbs daily and 1500 calories.

Unfortunately unless you pay for premium it doesn’t allow you to select/track anything other than Classic Dieting.

2135,2135,1,2019-01-28T16:15:32.000Z,Matiroxs,Disappointed,I paid $15 for the premium and I come to find out their calorie calculations are completely wrong. I literally scan a barcode with the label that states it’s 170 calories for 240grams of the soup but the app generates that it’s 150 for the amount. Calorie counting is what I paid for but accuracy is apparently not a priority.
2136,2136,1,2019-03-15T17:24:17.000Z,Kayaknana17,Disappointed,This apps consistently over estimates carbs when compared to my carb counting books and other websites. There is an edit button but it won’t allow you to save your choice. There is no recipe builder. Look for another app before you purchase this one

Overall I’m really disappointed in the app, particularly the logging food portion. Half the time the app is unfamiliar with foods and plugging in macros is a nightmare.

Also some of the foods they have are off on the nutrition for the serving size given. Myfitnesspal has more options already recorded and is far more accurate

It claims to be a keto app but is just another garbage app with no real focus on keto. Generic features, and expensive diet plans. Even the diet selection quiz is just a bunch of sales for diets that aren’t keto friendly. Pushing fasting plans is dangerous and irresponsible."

2189,2189,1,2019-08-27T03:54:13.000Z,JRT6185,Renewed with no notification,I had liked this app when I was using it.  Hadn't used for months and the subscription renewed with no notice whatsoever.  Every other subscription I have lets me know the renewal is coming up so I can choose if I want to keep going. Total rip off!!😡
2190,2190,4,2017-09-11T14:30:37.000Z,bre 10,Great app!,Love the color scheme and very straight forward once opening the app. Also like how I can change water consumption into bottle form.
2191,2191,1,2017-12-11T12:00:23.000Z,Ali6191,Disappointed,I was so excited to find an app geared towards use with the ketogenic diet! What a disappointment to see that I cannot use any of the features the app has to offer without making monthly payments. Truly upsetting that the app is only a good log unless you pay a fee. 👎🏼
2192,2192,2,2017-12-28T02:16:01.000Z,stacyjb,Not what I expected,"The food choices in the 3 week start up are not very appealing and an hour after I downloaded the month for 12 months, I see where it is 30% off now! So, I wasted that money!!!"
2193,2193,1,2018-02-16T23:56:18.000Z,Mr. Apoeodjvjd,Not accurate nutritional info,"There is literally NO benefit to this site over other free food tracking apps and I had to “upgrade” to the keto version! Nutritional info not accurate, scanning feature doesn’t work. Upset I had to pay for three months worth!"
2194,2194,4,2018-10-16T13:22:28.000Z,Ladybuterfly,Would give five stars,I would be nice if the app would allow for the user to enter nutrition manually.
2195,2195,1,2019-01-12T18:42:48.000Z,Ginaira,Can’t even use it,I’ve put in my information about 5-8 times now in attempt to try to use the app. It’s really frustrating that it just stays stuck and I can’t get into the app. I’ve deleted and re downloaded. I just wanted to use the app and explore it :(
2196,2196,2,2019-01-18T21:10:51.000Z,OnSundayMorning.com,Every button leads to a premium link,This app is more difficult than it needs to be and every time you press any button at all it’s a pop up telling you to go premium.
2197,2197,1,2019-01-28T08:31:09.000Z,abedzaza,Why do I need to sign up?,Their user agreement and terms of service is shady and appalling. ABSOLUTELY appalling:

There are other free counters out there that do a lot more without forcing you to pay, even some that give you healthy recipes as well!  I would not recommend this app"

I even tried using VPN and it still won’t work."
2209,2209,1,2019-11-05T06:49:57.000Z,RGMomma13,Crap,"I would honestly give this app a zero star review. It was nothing I though it would be, unsubscribed the same day, well the same hour & I’m not able to be reimbursed. Contact with the app is crappy they don’t respond.

2212,2212,3,2018-07-17T01:14:26.000Z,Mega979,Lifesum,I like this app but I wish you could really customize your own recipes. You should be able to import recipes and to adjust the grams manually.
2213,2213,5,2018-09-13T16:27:53.000Z,Happy Pappy32,So easy to use,Not a fad solution but long term plan. App. Is very simple to use. Has most foods in data base.

2215,2215,5,2019-06-25T19:10:35.000Z,Sugar Ribbon,Easy,Love this app.  I’ve tried others and this one is easy and fun!
2216,2216,1,2019-07-21T19:55:53.000Z,HuskerJosh,Premium doesn’t offer easy input for meals,There’s not an easy way to input for meals unless you use one of their recipes. I’m so bummed I paid for the premium upgrade and now am having trouble getting a refund after only having it for less than a day.
2217,2217,4,2019-07-19T21:06:17.000Z,j.lopez161,Oof,I wish the premium version didn’t have everything
2218,2218,3,2019-07-08T18:50:31.000Z,kmhunt96,"Great potential, could use a few tweaks",The Keto diet plan doesn’t account for NET carbs.  High fiber vegetables and leafy greens count against you due to this and give misleading results for people who may not know better.

2221,2221,1,2019-02-14T17:40:16.000Z,Pynuts,Bad data,Great design; however 9 out of 10 items have incorrect data. Some of the items have been verified by Lifesum and are still incorrect. These items are locked down and you can’t fix the data to add to your diary.

No matter what I do, the app never displays where my age is, and it says that I’m too young to use this app."

Which was part of the deal with the plan I purchased. There is no contact info anywhere. So now I’m stuck with this plan, that I paid for!!, that won’t help me achieve my goal for my wedding!!! Not happy!!!!"
2229,2229,1,2019-09-16T20:42:24.000Z,hmetzy,Cannot manually enter macro goal,I paid $ to upgrade to premium.  I thought I was getting the functionality to enter my own macro goals.  That’s not what this is.  You have to complete an assessment and it give you the goal.  Requested a refund 1 week in and was denied.  I find this unacceptable.
2230,2230,3,2018-04-19T10:46:04.000Z,Laynie21,Great App a little expensive,Really like this app. Subscription plans are a little pricey especially since others are free. Hoping they add a recipe import feature soon.

The database is rarely ever right.. I always have to edit the macros on my foods.. I’m frustrated.. and honestly wish I could get my money back.

2235,2235,3,2021-07-12T00:45:37.000Z,codstradamus,Solid UI. Great for Beginners,The lack of flexibility and customization in setting my own specific goals really limited the use of this.

2282,2282,1,2018-03-06T22:47:28.000Z,Cass0120,Subscription fee,I opted for the year subscription at the monthly rate of 3 dollars and change. Instead I was charged the full years price which I didn’t want to spend 45 dollars at this moment. And trying to get it refunded seems impossible.

2284,2284,1,2018-07-05T15:29:46.000Z,ashleyr91,Removed Features,The app is beautiful and I really used to love it but they removed the ability to personalize my macro settings for non premium users. The main reason I got this app was to track my custom macros so I will be deleting and switching back to my fitness pal.

I’m a senior in high school and I don’t have that kind of money. That feature should be included in premium-everyone deserves to know how their food affects their health regardless of financial status.

2320,2320,3,2017-09-29T13:11:53.000Z,Le jej,A fine tracker,The iPhone app is five-star and really great. The Apple Watch app is lackluster and doesn’t really allow basic input of info (at least not intuitively so).

I can more easily keep track of my calories on a piece of paper— and that IS free. Shouldn’t even give it one star.

I paid $25 dollars for this to tell me to eat within a 500 calorie limit per day. THATS NOT EVEN ENOUGH For MY BODY TO MAINTAIN ITS SELF. That’s so insanely unhealthy. I just can’t even.

Unfortunately unless you subscribe you are constantly bombarded with invitations to subscribe.  So not so good if you want to have the basic free plan.

If you are doing KETO or LCHF that is very important. Emailed the customer support and ask for my money back. Not a peep. Don’t waste your money. Much better apps available to count net carbs!
2453,2453,5,2018-04-11T14:34:05.000Z,dandelionlion,Incredible and perfect,"This app is with every penny. I purchased the annual subscription and have been using it for only about a week but so far it's been incredibly valuable. I have been entering in every meal, snack, and my water intake. Drinking water has helped me to be healthier and stay hydrated! I've been hitting my goals every single day. I love the design of the app, it's so beautiful. The designer did an amazing job at creating a very nuanced and detailed experience. It's a joy to use this app and it's fun! The illustrations and colors are fantastic. I was a MyFitnessPal user for years and since they were acquired by UA they stopped updating, improving, and evolving the app in any way. This is fitness and food tracking at a new and modern level. It's really a wonderful app. It is absolutely helping me to reshape my lifestyle. The added bonus is the integration of recipes that you can easily add to your meal tracking, not to mention the food is actually pretty good and simple to make. What more could you want? Also it's really nice to be able to choose between different types of diets, with each adjusting the calories you should be having at each meal. A feature that's really awesome is being able to see a summary of your intake for the day, which is broken down and categorized across protein, carbs, and fat, in a beautiful infographic of graphs and pie charts. I love just looking at this app!  So in that way it's quite personal, which makes the whole experience far more engaging than any other fitness app I've ever used. It's well worth the price and I will continue to use the app throughout my day to stay on track and be as healthy as possible. Keep up the amazing work Lifesum!"

Try a different number” like... ummm okay? Made me feel disgusting. Wish I could use this app to help with my weightloss journey.

2474,2474,1,2018-04-19T11:21:30.000Z,pkh63,Disappointed,Wasted my money on this. Recipes are too complicated for a busy person who doesn’t cook very well. Also there doesn’t seem to be a way to exclude seafood or narrow down likes and dislikes. Very disappointed!

2480,2480,1,2019-04-17T23:17:34.000Z,AlfonsoGalindo,Premium broken.,I bought the 1yr subscription but the app keeps asking me to buy premium. Not sure what’s going on but I just lost $45. I’ve already contacted support to no avail. Gonna look for a better alternative.
2481,2481,5,2020-08-22T03:43:01.000Z,Pegasister23,READ THIS,"So I think everyone can agree that losing/maintaining/gaining weight or just even remembering to eat healthily can be a very tough thing for anybody. This app, is honestly the HOLY GRAIL of nutrition tracker app. AND YES I SAY NUTRITION, because it is not just a weight loss, cal counter, water tracker, it’s so much more than that. I know this because I can probably say I have used every freakin app to try and make the habit of healthy living stick. So there is a few bugs here and there but nothing I can say that would make me stop using it. Mainly just certain calories not matching up etc. but I doubt the makers of this app can control that due to it probably being inputted from other resources, BUT I will say, it’s almost 75% accurate if you’re not specifically measuring anything out. I’m saying this because I do measure everything out, and honestly if you do measure your food and put it into the app, it is extremely accurate, some of the work has to be put on your side because a phone screen cannot accurately calculate how much your eating. It is a tool!!!! An extremely useful, well made, and STUNNING tool to help you along whatever health journey you are going on. My FAVORITE function of the app of all is you can create your own recipes where it calculates the calories in what you made, let me tell you, an absolute game changer. If you have an Apple Watch, it pairs the app to your activity😍. I lost 14 lbs and toned up (of course with exercise and such) but with this app by my side I honestly felt like it was effortless. Just try it for yourself I promise."

2554,2554,4,2020-04-26T13:41:26.000Z,Brookliey C.,"So many great features, but can be difficult to use.","I’ve actually enjoyed the many many features that are all bundled into this one app, and I don’t think any app can compare! However, I think there’s still some bugs and things that make it less easy to use. For one, sometimes you can scan the barcode of the food you ate (thinking it’ll be faster and easier), but then the calories that Lifesum logs are actually different from the calories on the package with the same serving size. I’m often having to jerry-rig the serving size to make it match the package because even an extra ten calories can make the app give you a frowny-face for the meal. Secondly, maybe it’s just my account specifically, but my weight is never recorded in permanence in the weight log. Everyday that I log my weight, it starts me right back off where I weighed before I started using the app, saying “wow you lost 5 pounds today!” when really I lost one pound and the other lost pounds were logged on previous days. In my calendar of weight statistics, it’s a stagnant, flat line from my goal weight for about a week and then will drop down as soon as I update it. Tomorrow, though, it’ll pretend I never logged a change yesterday and go right back to my starting weight. Lastly, I wish that the units the servings were marked in was more clear. Often “pieces” will actually mean the one serving size as mentioned on the package of the food, yet pieces makes you want to type in te NUMBER OF PIECES you ate. Like pizza rolls. “One pieces” is actually 6 pieces and 220 calories. In spite of all this, I think the app is beautiful in design and I love how many features are available. I also think that premium might not be worth it... I’m using premium now during a free month trial, and I don’t feel like it gave me a whole lot more. I don’t feel like having this premium month gave me a taste of anything I’d consider buying after my free period is over."

2564,2564,1,2018-12-23T13:41:42.000Z,JLAlbany,Do not buy it if you want your data in HealthKit,The app is still not able to import your data for your nutrition. It make the app completely useless for monitoring your daily intake and get insight.

2567,2567,1,2019-03-23T14:03:08.000Z,Cmh45,Latest release is so buggy,The app is unusable. It erased my goals and I can’t update my goal weight. It’s not properly setting my target protein intake for the day - currently says 1 gram is my goal. Not sure what happened in this release.
2568,2568,2,2019-03-25T11:26:09.000Z,slimOlive,Doesn’t add my weight of the day,"Also, I’m trying to “loose weight” vs. other options, but the app stays on “ gain weight” goal without possibility to change it."

2570,2570,2,2017-10-20T20:14:17.000Z,Jai41004,Inaccurate suggestions,Some of the pop up suggestions of things you should be eating contain recommendations that actually go against a great deal of research.

2580,2580,1,2017-11-22T13:07:08.000Z,Hamburgler10,Disappointed,It looked like a nice app but being forced to pay a subscription for this is BS. I’m going back to my fitness pal. I just wanted to see a breakdown of my daily nutrition without giving them my money 🙄
2581,2581,1,2018-01-17T19:02:42.000Z,Narcoleptic Goat,If only it would stay open,I can’t give a real and honest review of this app because it constantly and consistently crashes every time I try to open it.

2590,2590,1,2019-04-05T00:15:28.000Z,as8264@$&,Food log,This app is basically a food log. If you want actual keto diet recommendations… You have to pay for the upgrades.  I deleted it a few days after I downloaded it.  :(
2591,2591,1,2019-05-01T00:56:40.000Z,Bourjasc123,No customization,There is no way for users to customize their own diets. Seems so simple that I don’t know why they haven’t added this basic feature. Great UI but unusable.

2595,2595,1,2020-05-01T11:00:59.000Z,Lemongrasshaze,This should say in App purchase,You have to pay for subscription and it doesn’t tell you until after you’ve signed up.
2596,2596,3,2019-09-10T05:16:40.000Z,Stacischu,Plan on purchas,If you don’t plan on purchasing the premium plans.... don’t bother. It’s worthless without one.
2597,2597,1,2019-07-25T20:19:01.000Z,powerwülf,Looks good but extremely buggy,Daily data randomly disappears. The health integrations ($) barely work.

2600,2600,5,2018-06-01T14:54:39.000Z,robbreed2112,Love it!,Super simple.  Best I’ve found and worth the money!
2601,2601,1,2018-11-02T19:59:11.000Z,ajgovea,Regret purchasing,"This app is fraudulent. It makes you think you’ll get access to tons of recipes and provide a shopping list. However, it does not. Save your money!"

2604,2604,1,2019-03-28T02:22:24.000Z,Dills2214,Broken App. Not functional. DO NOT buy premium.,Was a great app for a few weeks. Bought 1 year of premium. Update broken many aspect of the app. Not functional at all. Feel scammed. Never again.
2605,2605,5,2021-03-05T22:06:32.000Z,courycourt,Love it!,Best app I’ve ever used for tracking food 💗
2606,2606,4,2021-04-18T22:20:03.000Z,Brunette #1,Great app for wellness,Great nutrition tracker. Much easier to use than other similar apps.
2607,2607,5,2020-05-30T18:57:52.000Z,usisisehwcheh,AMAZING,Helps me get on track and goes above and beyond!
2608,2608,1,2020-11-28T13:18:37.000Z,JM1541,Premium is not worth it,Yes the app is visually appealing but the meal plans are infuriating to use. There is no way to add additional food preferences (many people are keto AND dairy free) and the swapping process is tedious. I bought an annual plan specifically for the meal plan and it is useless. Waste of money.
2609,2609,1,2020-06-20T23:55:45.000Z,PMommy3.14,New user,As a new user I am unable to get past the “what else inspires you” screen. The “continue” button appears but does not respond to bingeing clicked.  I have even attempted reinstalling the app.
2610,2610,1,2018-12-28T14:58:59.000Z,Elizabeth Hatch,Not working...,So I paid for the year subscription and the Lifesum app won’t let me use any of the premium features. It recognizes that I have paid for it but won’t let me restore payment.
2611,2611,1,2019-01-20T21:50:15.000Z,Shawnleem1027,I would like a refund.,I didn’t realize that the subscription would charge me for the entire year. I realize that it’s my own fault. I requested a refund and was denied. $48 just seems like a lot for an app.
2612,2612,1,2019-06-08T19:34:28.000Z,laurie kb,Paid version very lacking,It’s not worth the money for the paid version. Highly disappointed in the app and was refused a refund. Save your money and avoid this app purchase.
2613,2613,5,2020-01-07T05:36:22.000Z,Lizette💜,This has helped me a lot,It’s amazing

2615,2615,1,2020-04-21T19:56:22.000Z,rubyjane1423,I’m confused,I downloaded this app to keep track of what I am eating but for some reason I cannot add in anything anymore (it worked for the first couple days) and I don’t know how to fix it
2616,2616,1,2020-02-20T13:17:02.000Z,lolxoxoing,App says i dont weigh enough,App told me my weight was too low so i had to fake a higher weight ! I feel bad about my weight as it is but the fact that even the app that’s supposed to help me cant do so.
2617,2617,1,2019-11-20T22:12:30.000Z,CoalBlackCat,Very disappointed,"Pretty app.  However, for the money, very few recipes.  Many of them have poor instructions on how to make the dish leaving out vital information.  I’m sorry I subscribed."
2618,2618,1,2019-10-14T18:14:50.000Z,Justjoshing101,Pushes premium way too hard,Apple looks great. but is pretty much much impossible to use without constantly getting ads for their premium subscription.
2619,2619,1,2019-08-23T11:34:20.000Z,xwb1989,It used to be great,It used to be great but now it’s buggy and slow. They don’t even bother changing their release notes for each new version. Very disappointed.
2620,2620,4,2018-09-28T03:35:06.000Z,jazzcb85,Good,I love this app. However it needs to expand the food data base.

2628,2628,1,2019-12-23T20:48:49.000Z,lets get it people,Good but bad,I really would love to use this app but I can’t pay for it so maybe if this app I could use without paying then I would definitely use this everyday
2629,2629,1,2019-08-23T01:27:35.000Z,iamtgifridays,Bad explaining,Says they charge about $3.85 for the premium every month for 12 months but I was charged almost $50 for the whole year. I have never spent money on something so stupid.
2630,2630,2,2017-10-19T18:18:37.000Z,Buho9221,This app keeps on crashing,Can’t open it for more than 20 seconds before it crashes.
2631,2631,3,2017-12-09T15:20:52.000Z,Hfrdhnhgghh,Ehh,It’s a great app but I feel like having to update to premium is pointless for the users
2632,2632,2,2018-04-07T00:37:28.000Z,Freakingoutmang,App info.,This app has really great features but the writing is way too light and very small. It needs a facelift. I like it I just can’t read it.
2633,2633,2,2018-05-20T15:54:40.000Z,Sam S D 82,NO CUSTOMIZATION!?!?!,They only have predetermined macro ratios and you can’t customize the tracking based on your goals. Waste of money for the paid version.

2641,2641,1,2019-01-08T04:56:39.000Z,moondaisy1229,App does NOT WORK,At first I like the app. Then I made the mistake of buying the premium membership and now all it does is kick me off anytime I try to look at the meal plan. The app is very defective. Don’t make the mistake I did. Save your money
2642,2642,3,2019-01-09T20:34:20.000Z,cyrsa,Readability,Wish font was bold. Difficult to read on cell phone.
2643,2643,4,2019-01-20T15:44:01.000Z,No breasts,Overall good,This app is good but has no place to account for breastfeeding moms.

2646,2646,1,2019-11-05T16:54:46.000Z,jljesse,Mediocre at best,"This app is okay. The very first food item I entered, Trader Joe’s Rolled Oats, I scanned in using the barcode feature and the nutritional data the app displayed was wrong by a significant margin. It’s sloppy and feels marginally more useful than a paper tracker."

2648,2648,1,2019-08-28T08:03:37.000Z,Gabsara123,No free trial or 1 month option,I really don’t like there’s no 7 day trial or 1 month option. I don’t want to pay $21 for something for 3 months when I may use it for 3 days and hate it.
2649,2649,1,2021-04-23T07:35:51.000Z,Ohayo_liao,Too many bugs,Unable to open the app until airplane mode turned on and off.
2650,2650,2,2019-02-10T18:32:19.000Z,EdwardAppEater,Collecting your personal health metrics,Very concerning “privacy” policy. Otherwise seems like a very basic app with a lot of frills. Realigned apple health with some moderately helpful food ideas.

2658,2658,3,2019-08-15T11:45:03.000Z,Mariiiiiiaaaannnaaa,Good Food Diary,This app is good but without buying the pro version all it is is a food diary. And not an accurate one.

2661,2661,1,2018-06-07T18:23:27.000Z,ErinBearbear,Okay app,You can’t use it without having one of their few diet plans. It also charged for forty dollars for a year subscription and I haven’t even used the app.

2777,2777,1,2020-01-08T02:14:44.000Z,cvlynnn13,THE WORST !!,I did a free trail for the app. I needed up canceling it before my trial was over. It just wasn’t a app for me. However.  My account still got charged 45 dollars and it overdrafted my account!!!
2778,2778,1,2019-10-21T01:48:06.000Z,SanPippie,Useless to me,Will delete my profile. I subscribed in order to use premium features but even then the app cannot be customized for my 3 food allergies.
2779,2779,1,2019-09-02T01:07:17.000Z,Anger bear,Apparently costs money,I just need a tracker that understands I’m not “over” on fats doing Keto. Cannot figure out how this works without joining the paying version. Annoying.
2780,2780,1,2018-06-02T12:06:24.000Z,bearded dragon girl<3,Ehhh,This app is ok but you have to pay for everything. It won’t even let you have a few recipes. You have to pay to for it.

2789,2789,1,2019-07-10T14:47:31.000Z,NicaRinda,Fake marketing - total scam,Total rip off. Charged immediately for program that offered zero of what I was looking for. My Fitness Pal is free and better. The library has free Keto books.

2797,2797,1,2021-01-02T14:05:45.000Z,Cindygarnold,Cancel,Unfortunately payment first then find out it is not a good plan. I entered food allergies but recipes do not reflect needs. An example I am gluten intolerant but the 1st day breakfast includes barley which is gluten.
2798,2798,2,2020-09-17T03:21:49.000Z,NaeChism90,Buggy,This app has a lot of bugs. Really disappointed considering I’m a premium member.

2805,2805,1,2020-04-21T18:13:48.000Z,kj45698,Eh. Not great.,the app continually is unable to save entered meals. The entered calorie amounts will be there when you first enter then disappear and you have to re-enter it. It does this over and over. Not worth it.
2806,2806,3,2019-06-25T12:08:51.000Z,Nivesj,Not enough branded food no scanner,This doesn’t recognize as many branded foods as carb manager app.

2809,2809,1,2020-01-21T05:08:22.000Z,Eternalgil,Over charged,I bought the annual membership to include a 30% discount. I was charged Full price. Can you please check this issue?
2810,2810,1,2018-01-03T09:01:59.000Z,Kels k.,Poor diet recommendations,Deleted immediately after it told me not to eat two days out of the week. Unhealthy and dangerous. No educated dietician would ever recommend this

2816,2816,1,2020-10-10T23:29:59.000Z,Anon-ay-miss,Very limited,I found the app to be very limited in what it offers. I wish I hadn’t paid for a subscription.  Little to no automation. Very simplistic. I am stunned this is considered award winning.
2817,2817,1,2020-09-18T23:01:37.000Z,Não é canja não,Very disappointed,"I regret subscribing. It looks nice but I cannot add my own cooking. The subscription is more expensive than others and offers less. Not happy at all!!! DO NOT SUBSCRIBE, YOU WILL REGRET!"
2818,2818,1,2020-07-29T12:43:28.000Z,Tinasz,No Room For Alternative Diets!,The app asks about your diet and I checked vegan! All food suggestions were meat. I would stay far away from this app!!! It clearly discriminates!!!!
2819,2819,2,2019-12-01T04:20:39.000Z,Alessandra otero,Signing up,Wouldn’t let me choose any number for my goal

2822,2822,2,2019-06-10T00:30:06.000Z,k2a2y2l-4a,Great UI,Seems like a beautiful app but the best features require purchase. Put in the purchased section.
2823,2823,5,2021-06-09T10:14:01.000Z,Some omnisexual Frog lover,GREAT APP,I love this app! I have an ED whiten I’m trying to tame and this is helping a bunch! Great app!
2824,2824,3,2020-10-24T21:04:44.000Z,Jen 22,Not for Keto,Entered all my info and realized I was under “Classic diet”.
2825,2825,3,2020-10-16T22:02:25.000Z,miraiza63,Not what I expected.,"I decided to do the 3 month Lifesum. I've had enough time to determine it is not for me. (I only used 1.25 months) It doesn't scan food items correctly. I will scan in the package and the calories and protein wouldn’t be accurate to the item I just scanned per serving. I’d either get the calories right or the protein but not both. Over half the time, you have to measure your food by weight instead of doing it by cups. I have to tweak most of my stuff and you can't look up uncommon food items a little under half the time. And I haven't once used there meal plans because at least one item in the recipe we don't have in our home. It normally is an uncommon ingredient that poor people wouldn’t have in their cupboard. They don't set up planning for a weekly bases or grocery lists like I was hoping. And there recipes aren't exactly set to your style. Chose clean eating and most recipes still lacked the protein factor which is my hardest obstacle. (I can never seem to eat enough in my diet) So don't get this app unless you are only counting calories and if that is the case don't do the upgrade. Not worth it. But I'm glad I did it so I now know what it all entails. This was a good step to finding what I AM looking for. Calorie counter and meal planner combo. But even that isn’t needed if you have the Fitbit app. PS it also doesn’t hook up to MY version of the Fitbit which was disappointing. If you still decide you’re going for it and want to pay for the upgrade double check in your Fitbit app to see if you’re Fitbit is compatible. And if you DO have a Fitbit I highly suggest you just pay the premium for that."

I started using the app again a month or two ago and I love how even on a free account, there’s a lot of trackers like water intake, exercise, seafood, fruit, and veggie trackers. I think all that’s great, and I love that if a food I scan isn’t in the database, I can quickly add it in and add it to my food diary."

2925,2925,3,2019-08-06T17:08:21.000Z,Kree8vkim,Need help/suggestions,"Hello! Thank you for what appears to be a really good app to get me on track for losing weight. However in just starting out it hasn’t been very user-friendly. For instance I wanted to input a burger, with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise, no bun. It would be helpful if, next to each item I need to track, there was an “increase” or “decrease” button. For example, currently,  to input 2 slices of bacon, I have to type the word “bacon” in the app two separate times and add it to be tracked, where it would be much simpler and less time-consuming if you had the ability to hit an “increase” or “decrease” sign next to each food to indicate that you’re having two slices of bacon (or three or four), without having to go back and input the bacon slice two, three, or four times (If that makes sense!) Also, the ability to delete anything on the “pre-planned menus” that the app suggests. For instance, on the “beef burger and lettuce leaves” dish, I do not eat onions, and I cannot eat cheese. There is nowhere for me to subtract those items from the “track this item” so then my calories, etc, will not be accurate. Also during the “test questions” there is no place to put foods that I wish to specifically avoid (ie in my case, cheese and fish). I’m not vegan/vegetarian;  I do eat beef, poultry, pork... but not seafood. And I don’t care for cheese and yogurt. So it would be nicer to have the ability to input foods to avoid so that I don’t get the suggested “salmon” meal ever! This is just my first day of using so I may have more thoughts as I go along but these are what jumped out at me to begin with! Thanks!"

At first look this app tracks what it needs to and has a nice I terrace to watch your progress. All of this can be seen before you pay the subscription fee. It’s only after you pay that you find all that is lacking. Most important, you cannot go back and add or edit past data. I missed entering my weight yesterday and now it’s impossible to enter it. Lifesum has such little integration with health/fitness products that, yes, I had to enter my weight daily. My Garmin watch and scale had zero integration with Lifesum. And because of the lack of integration with standard fitness products I was unable to even track my steps or enter my step count from my Garmin watch. It is unbelievable that Lifesum doesn’t integrate with any of the  Garmin products. The list of fitness products Lifesum integrates with is unfortunately very small. Basically, if you have an Apple Watch you will get some benefit otherwise forget it."

Plus I liked being able to log the recipes they provide so I don’t have to type in every recipe like myfitnesspal. So I paid for premium. I feel dumb."

I’m recovering but still struggling with my appetite and have to stay on top of my caloric intake to ensure that I’m eating enough, and my doctor suggested using an app. I was looking for something that would be easy to use so I would be motivated to keep using it, and made the mistake of immediately upgrading to the paid version of LifeSum. Aesthetically the app is well-designed and functionally easy to use. However, the glaring flaw with the app is that nearly every food item plugged into the app has wildly incorrect calorie/other macro information."

My biggest complaint though is as an extremely active person I do my own macro and calorie calculations. Lifesum’s app though (when you aign up) tries to be helpful and did them for me and they are not correct, and there does not appear to be any easy option to manually edit them. So while the app gives me an accurate calories and macro count, the “goal” total that shows whether I hit my marks or not is always off base. If they added a simple update to allow a manual altering of it this app would go from decent to great."

Lifesum not only allows me to track my calories but it calculates macros and gives food/meal ratings. I really enjoy the food and meal ratings and the tips it gives to balance your diet. It does more than the average app. It feels more like a change for a healthy lifestyle than just a fad diet. I purchased the premium because it goes more in depth with ratings and how to better your “score/rating”.

Most apps give the option of testing out premium for a week for free which gives the user the option of purchasing a membership if they found the app to be phenomenal. I kept trying to see if there was a free trial period, but all they offered was a 30% off premium and like a dummy, I caved. Now, I’m stuck between continuing the membership for the $30 something I paid for or just dealing with the fact that I wasted $30 something dollars on an app I feel like I got stuck with because a lot of the reviews claim it’s hard to get the refund. Aside from this, the app is okay."

I feel as if I was a bit misled while researching an app. I needed a meal plan for every day with a grocery list. Well, guess what? You’ll get that, but with only certain “plans.”  I’m not vegetarian. I’m not into paleo. I surely don’t want to eat like Denise every day. You’ll get enough meal options for a week.  I tried all meal tracts that came with grocery lists  (you’ll get grocery lists for 4 plans, you’re on your own for the rest). I really did. For a month. The recipes provided are horrible. No taste, bland, and quite frankly, I’d rather pay $10 for bulk unsalted butter than a 4 oz container of ghee. I cooked enough for my family of four. We ended up throwing over half of every meal in the trash. The dogs would not even eat it. Money wasted because the recipes tasted like trash.  What chefs approve of these recipes? Please let me know because I’ll keep an eye out for their names and avoid them. I’m open minded about different styles and food preps, but this is just bad. I 100% wasted money on this app and on the grocery store trips. The turkey on rye sandwich was the best offering of the bunch and even that’s a stretch. Yeah, I lost weight, but it was because the recipes were unappetizing, tasteless, and with the money wasted on groceries, I did not want to eat. If you are really and truly looking for help with weight loss and meal prep, please look elsewhere. This app could be great, but it’s not. So much potential, just not there yet"

3109,3109,1,2020-01-14T23:16:10.000Z,CCW223,Misleading,"My family and I do a Paleo/Whole Foods lifestyle which means we eat very clean with sugars that are non-processed like honey, maple syrup, and dates in limited amounts. I found this app very misleading because certain carbs are rated unhealthy but it then tells you your carb count is low and to eat more???? Which is essentially what the paleo diet is: low carb and higher protein with healthy fat choices. As an example Cassava flour is 100% carbs so it is rated as 😐 but your total daily intake of calories will tell you to eat more? If your rating certain carb foods as 😐 but pushing increased carb content how in the world is someone supposed to eat carbs unless it is essentially fruit based. I will state white potatoes are rated 88% carbs but are also a great nutrient source which is misleading again. So I do realize the app is pushing a healthier choice of carb but when food is mixed in the right proportions cassava can be a healthy choice so again??? Secondly, cashews and other nuts are not a healthy choice if they are in flour form but again in the right proportions they can be. Third, Ghee, avocado, and olive oil are not considered healthy choices either. Lastly, you can eat meat sources on the app (red meat) which drastically increases your fat intake for the day which is rated as a great source of nutrients and minerals. The concept is a good idea but very misleading and costly if you pay for the in app purchases which I will not do. I will be going back to my FatSecret because there is no “food shaming” going on in that app. By the way if your going to rate foods based on “healthy” maybe developers should consider a system that rates the use of pesticide and herbicide exposure along with nutrient depleted farmlands that have even vegetables highly unhealthy!"

But, do yourself a favor and use it for a month before committing to a $50 year long plan.  I really wanted to like the app, but the macros were incorrect on the food about half the time. If you caught it, you could report the error, then look through the database until you found something similar, but that’s about all you could do. Also, it would incorrectly tally up negative net carbs.  There were several times I ended up with more net carbs left to eat than I started with, all because the app calculated a food and gave it a negative net carb total.   The serving sizes were often incorrect for the macros given, as well. That can really throw your Ketosis out of wack."

It does not deliver on the basic functions, so do not waste your money on the upgrade if you choose to try this app. It’s nearly impossible to personalize your goals since it works on a percentage system. If you want 60 grams protein, the fat and carbs are calculated for you based on the “type” of diet that you selected. You can’t scale these yourself. I have also had difficulty getting it to use the calorie goal that I input. I have tried over 20 times and it just doesn’t work. It currently has me on a calorie goal of 1600 when I chose 2000 and selected my goal as high protein, maintain weight."

They thought alot about what operations will take the most time and tried to make them easier. You can create custom foods, then create meals (sets of food items) and add them to the directory. The dirctory is well organized with features like searching and marking favorites. People complain about the food database, but these things take time to develop and it sounds like they will be user submitable, so they will be handled by the community. Also the nutritional information varies a lot between different brands, so you are going to have to end up entering in a lot of custom foods anyway, I don't see this as a problem or an issue that iShape could possibly solve aside from doing what they have already done and make an expandable database."
3164,3164,5,2017-03-16T18:03:05.000Z,Brodak,Excellent and Easy to Use,"I use this app every day without fail. It has made me exponentially more aware of what I am eating and how much I snack throughout the day. By tracking what I eat carefully, I have been able to make smarter food choices and I snack mindlessly far less than I used to. I also love the water, fruit, and vegetable trackers because I have also been consciously drinking more water and making a point to eat more vegetables. The app is beautifully designed and very user friendly, and I enjoy it so much that I paid for the full subscription. I use this app more than I use social media. I appreciate that the app helps making healthy choices fun and simple, and I would highly recommend it regardless of whether you are trying to lose weight or not."
3165,3165,4,2017-04-05T19:41:48.000Z,CE360,I'm enjoying it!,"This is the first time I've ever tracked my food or paid close attention to how many calories I'm consuming every day. I'm not trying to lose much weight.. just working to get into better shape and improve my overall health. I really like using Lifesum so far. It integrates nicely with the Apple Watch, and my suggested intake changes based on my activity throughout the day. I love that you can add your own recipes and save meals! These features, along with the ability to save favorite foods will eventually save me lots of time logging food going forward. I also find that I save time by planning my meals in advance vs. logging each meal throughout the day. I haven't tried any of their recipes yet, but it looks like they have some good ones! Suggestions for improvement: This might be too complicated, but I'd love to see some integration with Allrecipes / the ability to quickly add favorite recipes from this site. I would also like to see more nutritional data (vitamins and minerals). I feel like most of their plans are a little crazy with the suggested daily protein intake (it's usually very high). All in all, though, the only thing that's really disappointed me is that I recommended this app to my mother and after a few days it wouldn't let her use it anymore unless she upgraded to a premium membership. I was under the impression that you could still use basic features without upgrading."
3166,3166,3,2017-08-01T00:57:13.000Z,semperes,Love a lot of aspects but definitely still needs to grow!,"As soon as I downloaded this, I loved how easy it was to use and how the interface was so visually pleasing and quick to get the hang of. I also loved how I could track my water intake as well as my exercise of the day. But as the days went by, some issues popped up that I really wanted to address in a review. Firstly is the accuracy of the food you can track. There have been more than a few times that the nutrition label read differently than what Lifesum had listed and because of that, I find this app not all that trustworthy on the nutrients I'm getting day to day and that's disappointing. I would also add that I wish the database had a more rigid system, it's a little weird to see more than one listing for a banana and not knowing which one would be the most accurate. Secondly I wish the targeted calories could be adjusted by the user if they so choose. I don't exactly want to follow what this app suggests when it comes to how much I should be eating for weight loss, I definitely think it overestimates. Lastly I wish there was an easier way to track meals you ate days before or ate for dinner one day and ate it for lunch the next. I will still continue to use this app but I hope in the future to see some changes!"

The new design is nice.. BUT!!! why take away the nutrient macro pie chart?!?!?!?!?!? That is just as important to know either you are slimming down or putting on some mass!!!! Doesn't help when you take in 3000+ calories when the majority was fat, or you didn't take in the amount of protein you needed. Please please please bring back the macro pie chart... That's is the only thing I ask for... Thanks...."
3171,3171,5,2015-02-12T18:28:22.000Z,pgscg,"So easy to track calories, protein, fat!","I used to do this in a spreadsheet. After adding foods I eat frequently that were not already in the huge database, I can easily set up my day and make changes if my schedule, dining out, grocery shopping changes. It's so clear I need to add exercise, as I know my precise intake and don't want to eat less. Things I would like added: ability to add a food to My Things when after scanning, finding it barcode was already in the database and verifying the food had been correctly entered, instead of only having the ability to add it to my diary. I had searched for it before I tried to manually add it, but it didn't show up. If it's in My Things, it will show up quickly at the top. I would also like to see a schedule of my nutrition, exercise and weight progress in addition to the progress bar that shows my starting, current and goal weight."
3172,3172,1,2015-11-17T00:32:34.000Z,arual9109,Disappointed,"This app has great potential but after using it for less than 24 hours (yes, that's all it took), I must admit that it is a letdown. I entered my personal information, updated my goals, connected to my Fitbit, logged my food and exercise... Only to find out that the information I was inputting was not saved accurately. Regardless of how many times I changed it, my birthdate and starting weight kept reverting back to an incorrect amount (that wasn't entered by me at anytime). This led me to doubt about the application saving the other information I was entering such as calories or workouts. When I spoke to a representative, I was told this issue would be fixed in about 3 weeks. That is ridiculous! Don't launch your app until it's ready to be used. Especially one that customers pay for! Another complaint is the meal logging. It is very difficult to determine meals based on ounces or grams. There are few foods that I found that were listed by serving size or quantity. Lifesum's selection of meals is not very expansive and most days, I found myself looking up the meals with another application to ensure I was accurately logging them. NOT WORTH THE TIME."
3173,3173,5,2016-01-29T05:46:39.000Z,Jstew88lifesumfan,Fan of Lifesum it's helped me a lot,"So Lifesum has seriously helped me. I haven't had any glitches with my app and don't struggle with added food to my food diary tracker. It's really easy and simple to follow, it does the math for you, to figure out how many calories your eating, how many grams of carbs, protein, and fat your consuming and how many you have left to consume. I've done the ketone diet before I got Lifesum... I only lost 2 pounds a month and was completely confused why I wasn't losing more! I got the Lifesum app and it showed me (by tracking everything I ate) that I wasn't eating the right balance of carbs, protein and fat for the ketone diet. I was floored when I found out certain brands of food that I thought were healthy was totally ruining my diet. I lost about 10 pounds within less than 6 weeks solely by using this app. I can scan in barcodes of food items I get and see how much of it I can eat. It's great, Lifesum rates it for me too to see if it's a good fit for my diet. I'm gonna keep and use this app for a while. And they have awesome recipes too."
3174,3174,4,2017-02-09T12:48:42.000Z,D. Hill,Lifesum,"Lifesum to me is an application that represents the potential of how our mobile devices can assist in us reaching the best physical version of ourselves. While my initial review is only based on the free version, I believe I can note how beneficial this application is. The application begins by asking about your age, gender, height and weight. Lifesum incorporates a beautiful colorful yet simple to navigate design. The bottom menu tabs are where users can bounce from category to category whether it be diet, nutritional facts or another section. The app makes it easy to input your diet with a comprehensive database that caters to any meal of the day as well as water cup diagrams that fill up and mark your progress with a simple tap on the image. Users can read daily nutritional facts and articles to better determine what is best for you. The premium version allows you to receive specialized recipes. I feel I have only touched a tip of the iceberg when it comes to the effect Lifesum can have on my life and many others."
3175,3175,3,2017-02-12T19:38:38.000Z,Henryjperc,Lots of potential but improvement needed,"I recently upgraded to the premium version after using the free version for about a week. I was very happy with the free version but found that the premium version has left me slightly less satisfied. One reason for this is the fact that you must constantly answer the 41 Life Score questions to get an updated score. To me, this is an annoying process and I wish it would update automatically from the foods I've recorded in my diary. Secondly, I also wish the fruit and vegetable trackers would update based off the food that I've recorded in the diary. It seems redundant to have to press an extra button to record this information. Finally, I was under the impression that the premium version would provide some sort of ""eat this, not that"" feature for the foods it deems unhealthy. I haven't seen this feature and I think it would be great. In the end, I really like this app but I don't feel like I'm getting a the best value for the premium version. I truly believe that it can get there with some updates and adjustments but for now I remain slightly unsatisfied. The app seems pretty new so I am more than happy to stick with it with hopes that it makes adjustments in the future."
3176,3176,4,2017-02-14T03:39:39.000Z,Lo-sim,Near perfect,"This is my favorite app for tracking calories. It blows My Fitness Pal out of the water in terms of its ability to teach you how to eat right for your fitness goals and how to generally lead a healthy lifestyle. The only flaw is that it has crowd sourced some of its nutrient data from users, which means there is some noticeable human error as you start searching for foods and looking at calorie counts and serving sizes. As long as you are being conscious about your foods and understand the basics when it comes to measurements and serving sizes, you'll avoid improperly tracking your meals. As with anything in life -- it's on you to think critically even when you want an app to take care of the bulk of the work. Trust that Lifesum does a lot for the small fee you pay to unlock those features. It's incredibly well designed. They thought deeply about UX and how to drive reengagement and motivate the user to make good choices. Well done Lifesum!"
3177,3177,1,2017-02-18T16:34:27.000Z,Whirlygirl13,Hugely disappointing,"No room to customize, not even with the upgrade (based on the description of added features). We prepare a large number of ingredients and dishes from scratch, so logging food in Lifesum is not accurate, as we're restricted to what's in the database. Also, the inability to see what's in the upgrade, specifically diet plans is frustrating. The default plan limits users to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack, all of which are calorie restricted. So for users who consume 5-6 small meals/snacks a day, this isn't helpful. If I log meals as meals, then I'm WAY under my calorie allowance as dictated by Lifesum, and some of my snacks don't get logged. If I log all of my snacks under the single ""snack"" tab, my meals are way under and my snacks are way over, according to Lifesum. There also isn't a way to log times food is consumed. Lifesum is probably alright for someone interested in very basic nutritional record keeping, but for someone needing to log for medical or serious health/fitness tracking, Lifesum has completely missed the mark. And to charge ridiculous monthly fees for a product that is mediocre at best is just ludicrous. Save your time, money, and frustration and use another method."

It is very easy to navigate and I like getting the little smiley face by my meal when I made good choices. I have many reasons why I need to keep track of what I eat, mainly because my skin tends to react to what I eat and I have been recently cutting out dairy for health reasons. That being said, since this is a overall ""healthy lifestyle"" app, I would LOVE to see more options for tracking, such as dairy-free diets, as well as maybe incorporating other lifestyle habits such as hours of sleep (it plays a big part in our lifestyle!) I would also loooove to see a way to track specific symptoms or reactions so a clear connection can be made between our food and how it affects us, such as how well your skin is doing (breakouts specifically), energy levels, cravings and how to target them, ability to focus, and things of that sort. Overall the app is great so far and I'm looking forward to seeing it's growth!!"

I actually like the fact that the entire database of food is not on here, there is a bit of a setup getting the foods you eat entered but once it's in it's easy and you don't have 50,000 others to go through to find the one you want. Having the database online didn't make a lot of sense to me at first but after using the app it was a well thought out way to go. A simple points calculator would be helpful so I don't have to leave the app to get to my other calculator and I'd like to see a notification icon telling me how many points/calories I have left for the day but these are extras that would be nice but are not necessary. The quality of this app makes me excited to see what they do with the updates as they perfect their already great design."

I liked that you could customize it to work with whatever diet you are on.  So when Lifesum kept pushing to upgrade, I thought, ""it is the New Year. Why not?""  I anticipated that the Gold version would be even that much better. It is NOT!   Adding food and snacks to this app is a nightmare. User-friendly it is not. I even tried to edit ""My Food"" on my computer by logging into the program via the internet.  It was no more helpful. In fact, it was a little bit more frustrating doing it that way. I do like how it imports my data from my Jawbone Up app &  how it relays information to the Jawbone app. It is very frustrating that there is no quick way to add food. I noticed that even when I scan the food items, the information uploaded to the app is incorrect. If you can't use this app to easily track and accurately record your food intake, what good is it?!"

The positive part of the app is that it integrates the Apple Watch and the tracking feature works well. I could have gotten that from the free version however. The paid version gives you a few recipes and a bit more nutritional information about your food. The app is designed to make tracking an obsessive behavior, which is great for those trying to achieve their health and fitness goals. I can certainly say that I am much more aware of my diet now that I use Lifesum."

Being able to track everything on a device I carry anyway was a huge difference maker for me. Quickly realized I was not eating enough on my workout days and over compensating on the rest days. Also does a great job keeping me honest on the weekends. Every improvement I can think of such as coordinating with say Subway to put all their data in is probably beyond the price. I usually end up manually putting in one meal a day so overall I spend 10-15 minutes a day which is way less than I exercise, but those are the minutes that are making a difference for me on the scale."

For one, the app randomly changes my date of birth for no reason. No big deal, but it also will change important things. For example, on Friday it'll say that I can eat 1200 calories. Then on Saturday it'll say that my Friday calories went way over the limit - I was actually supposed to only eat 1000! There are a lot more bugs, like not registering changes I make to my personal details, not syncing properly with the web site, and this one really small but irritating thing it'll do in the search, wherein I'll type a search query and then try to go back to change it, it'll delete the whole query automatically and force me to type it again. Pretty sure that's what the ""x"" on the right side of the search bar is for. Anyway, until the MYRIAD bugs get fixed, it's more irritating to use than anything."

Then, when I go to scan barcode, or search for the food, the food item does not show up on the list!!! 2) after successful food entry, I go to the webpage and the numbers dont match up?? For example, I go and add some Russell Stover’s sugar free candies, and instead of the calories reading 210 for 3 pieces, the total shows 99 calories/3 pieces, and all my macros show as decimals??

They want you to eat healthily, not less, because they give you how many carbs, and how much fat and protein you've had that day. They have it automatically set to a certain amount, but if you don't feel that's how many carbs you should be eating, or how many cups of water you should drink, you can change that! There's even help for gaining weight. I don't like the grading system, but I can ignore that. This app isn't magic, you have to have discipline and patience to enter everything you eat, but it works. Dropped 5 pounds the first week. After I stopped needing to lose weight, I kept it around just to help me eat healthier. This app is 👌"

I was so excite when I saw it tested me to see which diet is good for me based on my wants and needs. I gave four stars because the scanner is a bit wonky and they need to expand the food from groceries stores like publix, Whole Foods and popular restaurants.

After playing with the free version I opted to pay for the full version to get a more personalized plan and recipes.  That where my disappointment came.  While I loved the questions to find a right plan for you.  The recipes are very intricate and not family friendly if you have small kids.  Not only that, but there are only a handful of recipes to pick from.  Add the fact I don't eat pork, and the list is cut even smaller. It does seem there's a bit of a rotation to a few.  And at least half look delicious.  If you're a foodie looking to get healthy.  Or don't have the constraints of super busy evenings and early bedtimes, this may be a good app for you.

I think this app should allow you to either choose the amount of calories you plan on eating or how long you want it to take for you to get to your goal weight.  This would  be cool because if you chose how many calories you plan on eating each day, Ishape would tell you how long it will take you to to get to the goal weight.

If I input that I ate whole grain toast with Nutella and strawberries (pretty healthy I would say) it gives me a frowny face because I was supposed to eat 30g of protein. The amount of some of the nutrients it expects you to eat are actually unhealthy. The recipes they give you are not easy. They involve buying very specific health related ingredients only found at some stores. The only reason I use this app now is for tracking how much water I drink. I think you guys should really re-evaluate what is considered healthy and what is considered excessive. Make the goals more reachable for an average human."

It's definitly helped me keep better track of my caloric intake and burning.  I thought I was doing ok with pen and paper, but I would forget sometimes to write things down -- this is so easy, I have stuck to it without a problem.  The updates with this new version are great.  CONS:  It only saves 7 days (bad!!) and there is no way to email/save the data.  I work with a personal trainer and I don't have anyway to give him a copy of my log and it's hard for me to look back to see my progression week over week and analyze.  Please FIX!  If that doesn't bother you too much, it is WELL worth the $$."
3211,3211,2,2009-01-09T07:12:28.000Z,i [ heart ] code,Super Frustrating,"Those are the first two words I would use to best describe this app. I spent HOURS trying to get this thing to work and finally had to use notepad to log my workout. The one good thing about this is the food database it has; it's very extensive. However, in terms of workouts it lacks - A LOT. Some of the most frustrating things are the way it logs workouts. You can ONLY use time and not sets, reps, weight - the main things I was wanting to use this for and figured that it would be there considering they do have workouts you can select from. It is only helpful if you are doing cardio. Other than that I would strongly recommend you pass and get the free app ""Lose It!"" which does the same thing but its FREE."
3212,3212,4,2009-07-14T20:44:37.000Z,SarahG0529,Great App!,"This is a great app! Works much better than trying to keep a paper food journal. Love the ablity to take before and after pictures. BIG + is being able to start over and erase profile. I downloaded this a few versions back and used it for a while then kinda got off the bandwagon. Well, I am back on and it's great to be able to have a fresh start with this app. Food library is great. I did notice with this latest version when you add a food it won't let you scroll all the way down to enter sodium and fiber. Also, the custom minutes on exercise is not working quite right. Hopefully these minor bugs will be fixed so they work right again. These developers are doing a great job and I expect them to keep up the good work!"
3213,3213,4,2015-06-01T16:51:29.000Z,Christopher.3,Pretty Good Overall,"I wish I could do 4 1/2 stars but since I can't, I went with 4. The app is pretty good. I switched from MFP after they added the gaudy Under Armour logo to the app icon. The design and functionality is great and it's very easy to add food and recipes. The one problem I have is that when making food, you're locked in when you try to add the serving size. For example, I added peanut butter whose serving size is 2 tablespoons. I could select different units like cups or teaspoons but it would only let me have the serving as one unit like ""1 tablespoon"" or ""1 cup."" This isn't a huge deal for this, I just cut the nutrition in half but there are plenty of times where this becomes inconvenient like when the serving is ""11 crackers"" or ""6 ounces."""
3214,3214,3,2015-10-23T00:22:28.000Z,emma_stone,Really good start to a great app,"The app is so easy to use and very helpful in tracking meals and exercises for diets. It could use a lot of upgrading though. More diet plans would be nice, such as vegan and paleo as options instead of the standard, ketogenic, and 5:2. It also needs a A LOT more food tracking options. I can barely find some of the foods when I eat out if they're on there at all, or even basic foods that I eat at home. Also the suggested recipes could be a little easier for us cooking challenged folks. I don't have easy access to obscure ingredients and it's hard to tell how to substitute them for the recipes I really want to make. Most of them are labeled as ""medium difficulty"" but I wouldn't be able to make them if I have a culinary degree. Very great potential for this app, if only it was about 3 years more mature."
3215,3215,3,2016-04-16T00:28:14.000Z,Sarah's thoughts,Food log/input should improve,"This app needs to get it together/ generally make the food log better. It's great that we can see brands, but it's really hard to input things that are not logged as brand items. For example, today I had a bacon egg and cheese breakfast Sandwich on an English muffin. I typed that in and no results would come up. I searched just ""breakfast sandwich"" and it was mostly all Starbucks entries or other random things but not any homemade or prepared food items to select. I ended up just logging each piece of this food separately, which I find myself doing pretty often."
3216,3216,3,2016-07-23T01:42:46.000Z,BJWPost,Up until now was my favorite diet app...,"Before it became Lifesum this WAS a great diet app, and finally with all the updates it impressed me from my last review in 2014. However, something bugy has happened with accessing the food database when off line. I've always been able to access the data base when off line but all of sudden I can't seem to do that anymore. I'm not sure if an update with fix the problem but if it doesn't then it's really worthless to me. I travel internationally a lot and mojority of my time is not around easily accesseble WiFi. There are other quirky things that many of the users find frustrating but I've been able to do a work around with those, and having been an avid user since 2014, I'd say up until now it was the best diet up, regardless."
3217,3217,5,2017-01-15T02:09:15.000Z,Elegant Swirl,Pretty good 👍,"Lifesum is a great app. It offers so much and helps me make better choices on what I'm eating. It is hard to follow up on. I did it for about 3 days, was super happy with it, then quit doing it because it took a lot of effort for a busy person like me, then started again a few days ago. It has helped me a lot overall. Another issue I have with it is that it has so many plans and recipes, but only premium members can use most of them. I have to pay for the food that it tells me I should eat to be healthier or reach my daily goal, and paying for premium is too much for me. Overall I think it's a great app that helps a lot, but there should be more options for free members."

3219,3219,4,2017-08-01T10:31:39.000Z,stae301,Stae has choices,"This app is very good. I say do because there are many option to choose from regarding diet plans. The diet can be high protein, low carbs, healthy, etc., just to name a few. It reminds you to enter your meals, snacks, activities for the day along water intake. It breaks down the nutritional components for the most part. You can choose calorie count or not, that is great there are options/choices. What I do notice is the app will freeze at time where you have to log out wait a few and the log back in to put your information in. For a few days I was unable to put anything in at after updating the app. I must say, the company need to work on that part. Overall, I like the app other than that one major glitch."
3220,3220,2,2008-12-23T07:36:55.000Z,blind826,Great idea but a lousy app,"I don't write app reviews often. This app would be so great, if only for a few things. The graphs are great and I live the tracking tools. But, the app doesn't follow Apple's standards and it is extremely difficult to use. The touch screen is very unresponsive in this program, and there is no blinking cursor to inform the user where try are typing. This, and about a million other bugs, makes this app very hard to use. Many times I will click on a touch region and it won't respond. I have been having these problems since I bought the app months ago and they haven't been fixed. Also, the database could have more foods and it would be cool if it could track points. I love the idea an without bugs it would be 5 stars. The bugs are just so bad that it affects usability. P.S. I am on an iPod Touch with 2.2."
3221,3221,1,2014-10-26T23:05:52.000Z,Xander the Grey,Unreliable app,"I switched to this app from my fitness pal because the UI is much better and seemed less buggy. However, after purchasing a 1 year subscription, I found that while the UI is better, the app has huge problems with properly recording your data. Whenever I input a meal it will not show up until I force quit the app and reopen. About once a day, all of my data will disappear and the only thing that brings it back is restarting the phone.  Activity tracking has just as many problems. When it stops working even a restart doesn't work. I have to turn activity tracking off in the app and then remove all syncing in HealthKit to get it to work again."
3222,3222,2,2015-11-30T20:49:05.000Z,WontonDestruction,Latest update going in the wrong direction,"The latest update moves away from the initial simple design. It now takes at twice as many touches, or even more, to do anything."
3223,3223,5,2015-12-06T15:58:33.000Z,AbsentRadio,What more can you ask for?,"Keeps track of food, calories, weight, water, exercise, and macronutrients - all in one easy-to-use app. It even connects to step trackers and has a barcode scanner for food so you don't have to look specific stuff up, though you can. The design is appealing and easy to use.  Reminders are somewhat customizable (turn em on or off for food, water, or exercise). That's all the free version. There's even more stuff in premium that I have not explored. I saw something about tracking measurements that looked interesting but thus far I'm still too cheap to go for it. Honestly, it's the best app of this kind I've tried.  I highly recommend it."
3224,3224,5,2016-03-26T13:36:59.000Z,Sirinecee,Let me explain why,I love this app because it grades me based on ABCDE Grade on every single thing that I eat it essentially teaches me how to eat how to shop I use the skin option to scan every item that I might purchase at the grocery store. It syncs up to my fit bit my iPhone.
3225,3225,1,2016-10-11T05:06:49.000Z,Heoskehxikfbekskdbfb,No no no no,"I cannot begin to describe how angry and disappointed I am in this app. This app is working fine for me until I scrolled past their ad for their monthly subscription which said was three dollars and something cents a month. How misleading. I bought the subscription thinking I was going to pay three dollars a month, and they charged me the next day for $50 for a full year. Not to mention, they also say in their ad that you can cancel this subscription at any time, but that is awesome misleading and untrue because there is no option available for you to cancel it. And even if I was able to cancel it I doubt that I would see a penny of my money back. I have already emailed them I hope to get my money back, but with the experience I have had with them already, I doubt it will. I seriously would never ever recommend this app for anyone to use or buy from."

I feel as though it is more accurate, it does a breakdown of everything including sugar and sodium and it lets me know if my diet is balanced or not. It tells me to eat more fish or if I need to eat more calories. It is all based on the plan you pick and there are many to choose from. It also has a water tracker that you can track either glasses or bottles. usually I will start tracking my food and then quit but with this one I stay tracking, even if I eat bad. It sends me reminders to log my meals but it doesn't hound me with notifications. Like my title states, it's my go to."

It has a food database that I can use for some of my foods, but I LOVE being able to make my own foods and meals. Especially the meals, since I can set up all my meals in the database and then just chose that one when I have it. No need to constantly enter each item individually! The charts, graphs, and photos make a great addition to the program, that makes using it all that much more fun and informative. I would reccomend this app. to anyone and everyone, definitely worth the money. Anything that makes tracking your diet and weight fun is worth every penny. ;)"

The features are great, as I'm using the free version.  The gold version is only $3/month, so it's really not expensive at all.  Daily plate and the others also charge for pro features, so nothing different in regards to having to pay for additional features."

Until the last two days. I finally got a FitBit and synced the accounts, and since then the app consistently freezes up when I open it up to add a meal or snack. I shut down the app and try again, same thing. I've restarted my phone multiple times, freezes up every time still. I'd love to try to unsync the accounts to see if that changes anything... But they're syncing is set up through LifeSum, so if I can't open it, I can't do it. I'm grouchy and frustrated. Like I said, this is my only complaint, so you still get my four stars, but this is driving me nuts."
3233,3233,3,2016-03-29T03:11:37.000Z,aventyr,"Beautiful, useful, yet frustrating","I love the design and the idea behind the app but it falls a bit short. I found that if I search a meal or food item to add, there aren't a lot of choices and most often I can't find what I'm looking for. This being the case, I can't add this to my daily meals, thus negating the usefulness of this app. I am also very disappointed in the rating system in that I could have multiple A items but it equals out to a D or E because of the total calories. I feel like the rating should be based on healthy choices and not the number of calories, seeing as I could eat nothing but raw vegetables and still get a low grade. I think this whole system needs re-thought and is sadly becoming another app that wasn't very well executed."
3234,3234,5,2016-06-06T04:53:31.000Z,petekrueger,Great for diabetics,"Recently diagnosed diabetic, so I tried the Ketonic diet in this app. Also tested a couple other apps side-by-side. Deleted the others. And lost 20 pounds so far. They make it easy to make intelligent food choices, even when eating out with friends, by putting all the data about your options right in front of you! And the recipes have been the real time saver. They really understand the different diets and push recipes to you that fit your diet, unlike the other apps that are totally calorie-centric (and completely untrustworthy for carb-sensitive people). A few more tweaks and they'll be the perfect app, but it's already a 5-star app."

3236,3236,3,2016-11-22T04:32:36.000Z,MrSchatz,"Great at first, but inevitably too time consuming","This app is great. It focuses on doing deferent diet types, gives a relatively small list of recipes that work with said diets, and allows a certain amount of customizability. But there are some functionality that seems clunky and slow, which makes this app more of an obstruction, than help. They have a custom meal feature, but it's not convenient. I'm not going to take the time to input all the products that aren't in the database, and the ones close to what I have seen strangely too healthy. It would be great to have more features that build custom meals in a less round-about way and an expanded database. Having a feature that recognizes nutrition fact stickers would be amazing. Now that is a premium feature."

I've been trying for the past day to be able to get it open again but it won't. So it's awesome until it quit working. You put in your height, weight, age, your goal weight and it'll estimate how much weight you should lose over a certain period of time. It also keeps track of what you eat by entering in the name or scan the barcode and just hit The button and it'll calculate all the calories you had for that meal. It'll tell you if you've had too many or too little calories for that day and it will also keep track of how much water you drink by just tapping on a little picture of a glass."

I'm not too hot on the fact that it only shows active calories on the main screen next to consumed calories. It would be nice to have all calories (resting plus active) so I can quickly see where I'm at calories in/out instead of having to look up my resting and do the math myself. The biggest problem though, and this is a more redent one, which has caused me to cancel my subscription is the glitch that resets a lot of my food entries. I enter my dinner and the app says 1 serving = 300 cal then I go back to check it later and it says 1 serving = 1 cal. So I constantly have to reenter food in creative ways in order for the calories to be correct (ie 300 servings/300 cal). That's if I can remember what the nutrition facts were on the frozen dinner I had a few hours ago."

Highly recommend using with a Fitbit or similar unit though, because you are constantly burning calories, not just when you're exercising. My favorite part of the app is the database of foods and the bar scanner tool. It's good for keeping track of caloric consumption and how much fluid you drink. But it changes the calorie limit depending on how much you exercise which can be misleading or confusing. I like that you can add unlisted foods. I also like that you can add your own exercise activity and calories burned, but you can't put how many minutes spent on that exercise. (It always just says 1 minute)."

You have only one thigh machine, even though there are at least 8 that I know of. I'm sure they all burn different amounts of calories. Bicycle kicks not on the app; no planking, amazing exercise & still not on your app! Lying leg lifts? No. Flutter kicks? No. Leg raises? No. Russian twist? No. Plank kick throughs? No. Plank knee to elbow? No. It's really concerning the amount of exercises not on your app. CHEST PRESS!? How can you not have something so fundamental?

Most of the questions were unintelligible the rest were not applicable to what i was trying to do.. but whatever about that. The database is pretty big and im not worried about being 100% accurate with my calories so i just put in approximates. Id really like a tutorial on like, what an ounce of food looks like, or like how much is an average glass, idk but i dont know that stuff. But it wasn't that hard to look it up.

The team continuously makes the app better every month and actually listens to user feedback on what could be improved on. It's super easy to log what I eat during the week and be able to balance it out with my workouts. Some of my favorite features include a useful(though somewhat limited) recipe book and the seamless integration with Apple Health Kit and other smart health products(such as my withings scale).

The only complaint I do have is sometimes the specific items listed do not have accurate nutritional information (Ex. A certain brand of something says 1 cup has X amount of calories, but it actually has Y amount of calories per cup). And fixing the inaccurate information is a process because you have to report it and it has to be approved before it is changed. Highly recommend this app, though.

There are options for everyone, whether you ARE trying to lose weight, maintain your weight but eat healthier, or even gain weight (muscle mass). Also, there are so many options for different foods you can put in to your log, including brand names so you know that the macro count is accurate.

Also would like a tab to view the entire day and sum of all the macro and micro nutrients like myfitnesspal does so I know how many macros I have, or don't have left."
3253,3253,5,2016-03-01T02:27:14.000Z,Eman's son,Fantastic,"I have used Lifesum for quite a while now and just loved how it is set up. I switched to MyPlate because I heard some hype about it, but found even with its features it just isn't nearly as nice as Lifesum. Lifesum is simple, easy to navigate, and has just enough on it to tell you what you need without clouding up the dashboard with things you don't want. It has nearly every exercise already on it (though I found when I input my climbing the calorie burned count seems high).  This app is amazing! If you need a macronutrient tracker or a calorie counter or a fitness tracker, use Lifesum! 100% recommended!"
3254,3254,3,2016-04-19T17:17:27.000Z,Lauuurennn,Things to fix in next update,"This app has a lot of positive qualities and great potential. I have had a lot of success losing weight since this app sets a daily caloric intake goal for you based on your current weight, your goal weight, and the amount of time you want to lose the weight in. I also like being able input recipes and meals that I make often so they're easy to track. There is also a good database of foods and their calories."
3255,3255,4,2017-01-05T23:48:02.000Z,Made2k,Good but with inaccurate food info,The app so far seems great. I wanted to get this to try and eat healthier in general and also have a way to see nutritional info for things I'm eating so I can take insulin for all the combined ingredients (I'm a type 1 diabetic).
3256,3256,4,2017-03-16T00:00:23.000Z,Hannah Bircher,Mostly satisfied,"It is a great and thorough app. Lots of features and plans. You can track water, exercise, food. It helps you set goals and it also tells you how you are doing at each meal and how to improve. It also has a quiz that shows you what you eat enough of and what you need to intake more or cut out. I have premium and it's $45 for the year which is cheaper than fitness pal. I think this app is better than fitness pal by far."
3257,3257,3,2017-06-02T18:21:11.000Z,The Sometimes Healthy Teacher,Would Love to Love It,I adore the smiley faces and meal/food ratings. They are so encouraging! I love the water symbols. Just touching the glasses to fill them up make me feel like drinking more.
3258,3258,5,2017-06-16T21:48:18.000Z,Rubym:),Great app!!! Review from a nutrition profesional,I am updating my review based in the new update.
3259,3259,4,2017-09-01T19:32:53.000Z,Vio9000,Fun with a little clumsiness like all apps,"Fun calorie-watch app.  You can choose from a variety of ideal diets like paleo, low carb, balanced meal plan, whole grain emphasis,  etc and you get little smiley faces when your meal confirms to your plan.  You can find recipes that got with each plan to inspire you."
3260,3260,5,2013-01-20T04:38:02.000Z,Whoiswhose,Keeps getting better,"I've used ShapeUp for years, off and on. At first you had to add everything yourself and the app crashed often or was slow, but I've been delighted to find that every time I pick it up again it just works better. The copy from previous day is a dream and I love typing in recipes and having calories per serving automatically calculated -- saves guessing from similar foods on the web. Plus, the app is speedy and hasn't crashed in a long time. Thanks for continuing development and making this a great, reliable app that keeps getting easier to use!"
3261,3261,5,2013-11-10T23:24:03.000Z,Lady M2011,Great for a freebie,I agree with most of the reviews.  I too wish there were more choices for exercises.  I really wish there was a better way to pick from recent meals rather than join a club. I am losing wt using this program.  Thanks
3262,3262,4,2015-04-17T00:06:25.000Z,KublaiKan't,Nice but sync unreliable,"I've used this app for about a week now, very intensely, tracking everything, even water."
3263,3263,5,2015-07-01T03:06:04.000Z,Bryce Ipad,This is great!!,"I'm in love with this app! It's (VERY) easy to use which is great and it has a lot of food and exercise options which is great because all you have to do is look up the food, and click on it, it counts the calories for you! And he exercise options are great, especially with sports practices, because it has a lot of options like if I did easy, medium, or a hard workout! It also gives you tips and tricks to help motivate you, if fact it just told me a second ago, ""you just danced, you need to stay hydrated! Grab a glass of water!"" Sry for this long review I really just enjoy this app"
3264,3264,5,2015-09-12T17:54:48.000Z,(-*sprinkles*-),Get This App!!!!,"Amazing app to keep track of your diet and exercise! This app asks you your age, weight, height, and gender to calculate just the right amount of calories you should be eating. With notifications turned on, this app will remind you when its time to eat or drink some water. If you are willing to pay a monthly fee, you can go even deeper into your calculations by tracking the intches around your body parts. You can also get access to tasty and healthy recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Even if you dkn't want to pay, this app will benefit and enhance your life to the very fullest! Get this app!!!!!"
3265,3265,3,2016-02-04T15:42:32.000Z,Marieb52,Best app BUT too expensive,"Come to find out you can only save 2 recipes with the free membership.  So I'm thinking, ""No problem,  I'll get a membership.  $3/month is doable.""  Come to find out it's $9/month unless you buy 12 months.  Ridiculous!  This is my favorite of all the food logging apps but what is up with the ridiculous price tag?  I like getting grades for my meals although I feel like it wasn't always accurate.  There is also a problem with the accuracy of the food that I would scan in.  I was constantly having to double check that the calories and servings were right.  I'll probably go back to my fitness pal or 'lose it'.  Too bad because I like this interface the best."
3266,3266,4,2017-01-17T04:00:12.000Z,J_n_1112,I like it!,"I just started using this app, I usually use my fitness pal. I have been using both and comparing both. I do like that this app has recipes and a specific plan based upon you desired goals. I do feel that there's a good amount of features though that you must pay for which is quite upsetting. Just to track my measurements I have to pay, yet my fitness pal, I can do all of that. I do wish there was a way to customize your water intake. I maybe not finish all my water and prefer to just input the correct dose. I do love the smiley faces next to the each food and for each meal, as well as, the recommended calories for each meal."
3267,3267,5,2017-02-15T04:22:50.000Z,Argira,"Love it, love it!!","I hate calorie counting, this app goes beyond. Is not about just the calories but the quality of food you eat and Lifesum does that."
3268,3268,5,2017-04-29T14:40:20.000Z,megggxo,In love,"I seriously love this app. I've never been able to consistently track food and I've been at it almost every day since march (2 months) and have been on and off since January. It's been so helpful, so easy and Kees me motivated. I've struggled with counting calories before. It made me feel super restricted but this app somehow makes me feel in control and makes me want to stay on track to reach my goals. I love tracking my food as crazy as that may sound! This app makes it fun and easy and gives you helpful, informative guidelines along the way!!! 10/10 recommend"
3269,3269,5,2017-06-30T15:38:44.000Z,Rose guide,Absolutely Wonderful!,"I have been using this app on and off now since the beginning of the year, and because of it I have lost a grand total of twenty two pounds. I still have some ways to go, but it is completely worth the time and effort. Although, I never did use the premium packaging because I cannot afford it, I do believe that this app has truly changed how I feel about my eating habits. If there is anyone reading this who feels nervous or humiliated about the awkwardness of using a fitness app, don't. It will get more natural and easier the longer you use it, so don't be worried."
3270,3270,4,2008-10-14T17:26:27.000Z,Gotti Santorini,This App is SICK! But....,I just got this app a few days ago and I LOVE it. It is exactly what I was looking for since Calorieking has nothing coming out for the iphone. The only thing I would like to see improvements on are:
3271,3271,5,2009-01-07T05:26:45.000Z,larrybeo,Updated With HUGE ONLINE FOOD DATABASE!,"I paid $9.99 for this app and will not complain one bit about it. It is worth every penny. The GUI is great, it responds nicely, works as promised, and they have just added a *HUGE* online database of food. Yes, I no longer have to skip over foods because I don't feel like typing in the nutritional facts myself! How great is that? Searching for words like ""Stuffing"" and ""pot roast"" will bring up numerous choices that you can chose from, then once you pick the one you want, you can add it to your database with one click. It works seemlessly over the 3G, great app. Let's lose some weight!"
3272,3272,4,2016-02-09T04:03:20.000Z,whatmakesmesmile,Great...but you  can tell it's a new app,"It's a great idea, love it much more than lose it, but like everyone has said, the system has a lot of flaws that seem weird for an app that looks as good as this one does. Biggest issue because it's crucial to what the app is for: Because portion sizes are really confusing to set when you add a food, calorie values are just all over the place. If I hadn't been tracking calories so long I would have no clue how many calories is actually in anything. Finally, navigating is a bit tedious, even when entering food. If they can work on the above this app will be in a much better place."
3273,3273,3,2016-07-09T18:16:58.000Z,rcarter236,Arguably one of the best nutritional apps out there but needs better price options!,"I love this app so far. The interface is clean, simple and easy to use. Adding food is a bit tricky at times but this is the best attempt by an app I've seen thus far. My only issue is the subscription options. I'm not one to sign up for monthly plans. Especially via the App Store. I like to purchase in blocks or buy 1 time and done. I also wish they would offer the first month or 2 for free. I can't see the full potential of the app until I buy it for a month. If they offered the first month free, I probably would have loved it so much that I would have subscribed. IMO. Other than that, love this app!"
3274,3274,4,2017-01-21T18:41:29.000Z,Kels7289,Just what I was looking for,"Let's be honest, I'm terrible at paying attention to what percentage of my food intake is carbs, protein, etc.  With Lifesum, now i can have that information with the least amount of effort!  You can document your meals consisting of raw food (fruits, eggs, etc), homemade meals (honey balsamic chicken with broccoli and cheese), and even dining out!  They make it so quick and easy to keep track; there is even a barcode scanner for expedited food entry.  Props!  You also get recommendations for items that would benefit your diet, such as adding peanuts or a specific protein like fish.  It's like having a professional nutritionist right at your fingertips!"
3275,3275,5,2017-01-29T12:58:05.000Z,I'm Bri,Much More Than A Journal!,"Lifesum is absolutely the most useful app I use. This app does not sit idly by, forgotten, like so many that are cumbersome to navigate with little reward for the work. With Lifesum I jot what I ate or scan the barcode and the app automatically notes all of the nutrition info for me. Even better, it syncs seamlessly with apple health kit, and also provides a range of nutrition plans (they are not ""diets"") to choose from to help you reach your own goals! It also ""learns"" your usual foods and keeps them at the ready for selection. Exercise log/calories burned? Water consumption? YES! It has those too!"
3276,3276,5,2017-02-08T17:42:55.000Z,dpac90,Switched from MyFitnessPal,"I'd been using MFP for more than 6 months, and started growing tired of its poor user experience - too many steps to log entries, slow loading times, and not to mention random crashes."
3277,3277,5,2017-04-01T16:57:10.000Z,miranchard,40lbs lost and counting,"I love this app and have tried a couple other fitness tracking apps. This one is different because of the day ratings & food ratings which gives you a better idea of the overall health of the food at a glance, without having to do calculations. I like the ability to see the breakdown of fat/carb/protein and set goals for yourself based on these values. The app itself is very well designed, has great graphics and feedback, which makes you want to open the app and log your food every day!! Buying the premium membership is so worth it!"
3278,3278,5,2017-05-27T00:39:51.000Z,mmmmmmmmia,Have been using it for more than one year,"Just like I said, I've been using this app for more than a year and it works for me most of time. It helps me tracking down my everyday intakes, though the seven day calories calculator is never correct, always missing somedays' exercise calories. But the one month or three months count are quite accurate. Though after several updates, it didn't show (or lost) all the data from three months ago. So far, there's still space for improvement and I will keep using it. :-)"
3279,3279,4,2017-08-28T02:28:50.000Z,ReggaeMuff1n,Love it but needs tweaking,I love this app and bought the premium version to put myself on one of the diet plans the energizer which is very similar to what my personal trainer suggested as a diet for me.
3280,3280,1,2011-01-01T19:41:00.000Z,ColoDave,A versatile application,UN NO!!!! -----UPDATE JAN. 1st------ !!! Very very sorry I used now. I had many notes each day n used all things well without subscription based!!
3281,3281,4,2012-08-10T19:30:55.000Z,JASM74,Good for the price,I have used other food trackers and I like the simplicity of this one and the lack of ads of the website version. I upgraded to hold and I have no issues with it linking to RunKeeper. In fact I love that I don't have to manually enter my exercise!
3282,3282,4,2015-07-20T20:31:03.000Z,SynthesizedLife,Perfect for What I Need!,I love this app. I'm trying to track my diet without obsessing over it and Lifesum makes it so easy. I like that I can search their extensive database and even scan barcodes!
3283,3283,5,2015-08-23T19:37:42.000Z,Criviere,"Great App, Read My Review.","This app is great for tracking calories and the amount of water you drink during the day, also, If you exercise with your phone or Apple watch it will account for the calories you burned during your workout and add to the amount of calories you may consume for that day. The only thing that can be tricky with the app is when you eat out at privately owned restaurants which do not list calories. In this case you will have to add each individual food item. Overall, great application and I love that they have the app for the Apple watch!"
3284,3284,5,2015-09-19T23:46:45.000Z,Illuminappy,One of the best trackers available,"Ease of use is an understatement. You can scan items into your daily log. Track and understand how your food choices are meeting criteria for your chosen diet. Recipes are ok, could use more on the daily feed or a database to directly access anytime, include shopping list too! Easy to log exercise and water intake. Add foods or recipes if the library doesn't have it. Never had a functioning problem, this app opens and works perfect every time. I strongly recommend to anyone who wants to track their food and exercise. Thank you!"
3285,3285,1,2016-01-17T16:22:31.000Z,alainafuata,Not worth it!,"I was very excited about this app because on top of being able to track my meals and work outs each day, it would provide me with suggested recipes. The catch is though, that in order to unlock all of the recipes, I had to upgrade to the gold version. BIG mistake! Logging anything is difficult. It's nearly impossible to get accurate food portions or even exercises for that matter.  There's some type of arbitrary grading system that makes no sense whatsoever. On top of that, I haven't gotten any new recipes! I can't believe I bought a year-long subscription to be told how to put avocado on toast everyday.  The most disappointing part is once I paid for my subscription, I'm stuck with it for the full term. There's no way to cancel it until it's over. Save your money!"
3286,3286,4,2016-01-25T20:54:47.000Z,Nickname67686960,"Beautiful UI, Good functionality","I've been using this app for a while now and find it very useful for it's purpose. I have seen a lot of bad reviews for this app from people lacking knowledge of how to properly use certain features (deleting food entries, update vs adding food, favoriting food, creating meals) all of which this app includes. My only suggestions are the following:"
3287,3287,4,2016-09-10T21:19:29.000Z,MichelleBinAK,If I could give 4 1/2 stars I would ....,I purchased the paid version so that I could take full advantage of the app.
3288,3288,5,2017-06-16T05:44:26.000Z,haleighshell,LOVE this app,"I have been using another calorie-tracking app for a couple years now, but downloaded this to try it out. LOVE it so far. I did buy the year subscription, but I feel it was money well spent if you're serious about eating better. The interface is very simple and intuitive to use, and is very supportive and informative on what to expect from your body with your desired plan. I strongly recommend this app. The only suggestion/desire is for the app to have a weight tracking function to keep track of personal progress."
3289,3289,4,2017-07-30T03:48:28.000Z,Ajbtabbjvmavrkv,Great but...,"This app is awesome! Helps me keep track of how much water I drink a day, how many calories I'm actually consuming with a snack, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also helps me keep track of my workout and how long I do it for. This app is great for losing, or gaining weight but also maintaining the weight you're at. It also offers the option to help with eating healthier and getting leaner.  The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the fact you have to pay a fee to be able to get the full use out of the app. Overall it could use a few minor changes but I really do love this app. Highly recommend."
3290,3290,5,2008-10-09T19:23:00.000Z,Slimgoodie86,"seamless programing, great interface","I really enjoy this app and cannot wait for more updates. They listen to all of the feedback you submit and I have never been so satisfied with a digital food diary. I mean they even have the activity calorie count for body pump! The database will soon grow, but I have put in plenty of foods already so Im not complaining. I love how you can track calories, point, grams of carbs and just about anything. I have waited two months to write this review so I really hope you take my advice and look no further for another diet program."

I'm in my mid-forties now, and work plus family makes it challenging to be as physically active as I used to be. Portion control had not changed. Add in a slower metabolism, and my doc recently informed me I was 35 lbs overweight."
3292,3292,5,2015-06-08T03:19:25.000Z,MrNocturn,Pretty great,"The only thing that's a bit iffy with this app is the portioning and the averaging, but otherwise it's great. It's just how am I supposed to know how much of something I ate? Oh well, it's still good to keep track and useful for developing better eating habits. Especially once you realize what you've been cramming into your face hole. Another great thing about this app worth mentioning is the fact that it also has a lot of the different brands of certain foods too. I really recommend this app, it's very worth while and worth a try. Give it a chance!"

3294,3294,5,2016-06-11T17:20:31.000Z,Ragrig,Useful for Bodybuilding,"I love this app, because not only does it help you track your macro-nutrient requirements and caloric intake, it gives you ratings of the food you're eating. It reminds me to stay hydrated as well. You can also track your exercises and it will change your macros based on exercise. The only problem is that it doesn't have all the exercises you would do in the gym, but I usually assume all chest workouts under the ""push-ups"" category. Also negatively, you have to pay to be able to track all the micro-nutrients."
3295,3295,5,2017-02-13T03:26:49.000Z,Blank_screenname,Teaches you how to eat correctly,"I'm kind of ashamed that as a 29 year old guy I had trouble keeping track of meals and making sure I ate enough food. I work on the computer a lot but I'm also physically active, this app makes eating good well-balanced diet a lot easier. It helps, it has become such a habit and helps me keep on top of my calorie and nutrient intake. I highly recommend Lifesum if you want to step away from eating so much processed or junk foods, the food ratings make decisions a lot easier and helps reaffirm my food choices throughout the day."
3296,3296,5,2017-02-24T06:12:24.000Z,KristiPerr,Best Nutrition Tracking App EVER!,"This app is the best app for tracking not just calories but nutrition! You can see your macronutrients, calories and foods for the day. Very easy to find any foods you have eaten in their database. Also LOVE that they give you an option to be on meal plans and rank your day based on the plan. For example, I eat low carb so I'm on their Keto diet program that way it tells me when I've eaten too many carbs. Most apps will only tell you the standard American diet recommendations, but this one has multiple options! Highly recommend!"
3297,3297,5,2017-05-23T04:41:40.000Z,_belinds_,Great and beautiful app,I think this app is awesome because it holds my attention and the design is something I enjoy looking at everyday (unlike myfitnesspal). My only complaint is that the inventory of food they have is quite poor. I've noticed that entries done by real users are not accurate and then get circulated around. Example: There is a sweet potato entry that at 0 grams is over 2000 calories! Clearly incorrect... with that being said this app is great and I use everyday! Super easy to customize the setting to your needs without upgrading to premium.

I have been able to loose 20  pounds so far! It's easy to use, and you can personalize everything. The in app purchase is a must if you are serious about weight loss though. I used the free vision for the first two months which is great for calorie tracking and logging exercise. I then decided to buy the 6 month subscription which now allows me to make and log recipes, coaches you on food choices, gives awesome meal idea, and much more!"
3299,3299,1,2017-08-17T01:06:04.000Z,RachelaNY,Too many bugs for an app that I am paying for,"This app is a great concept. It's easy and user friendly, when it isn't crashing. It gets me to drink more and eat more vegetables and fish. However, it crashes multiple times a day for me. It will not allow me to input food for the next day, as it puts that food on the current day. It's so frustrating. Also, recently it is not correctly searching for food products that it has brought up in the past. I am very disappointed. With each bug fix, these problems get worse. In fact, ever since I started paying for it, I have had more issues than before paying. I will continue to use it since I paid for 3 months, but at this time I absolutely cannot recommend it.  Use any other app."
3300,3300,4,2008-09-22T02:09:06.000Z,gswans1,very good,"This ap is really pretty good.  Not perfect.  You will run into situations where what you eat in not really covered by the included data base.  You can usually fudge it by putting the components of what you ate into the log separately.  Just takes a little more time. However, I will say that the ability to track what you are eating really helps.  That extra piece of cake, nope, gonna push me over the limit.  I think that the new update and the ability to add foods will add to the utility of the program.   It might sound fussy, but no olive oil, really...  For us short fat white guys it is a hope for redemption."
3301,3301,1,2009-01-08T08:57:38.000Z,Dauidus,Great Weight Watchers Tracking App!!!,"After looking around extensively for an app to track my weight watchers points, I am very pleased with iShape.  Not only does it let you keep a calendar that tracks points and daily percentages for you (with some effort), it also allows you to search an online database and save submissions as favorites.  Then, you just need to add that favorite to your daily food list.  I also like the weight tracker with added charts to see how you have progressed.  It even lets you add exercise points, though adding the info yourself is sometimes necessary.  I have found that this app works great alongside the free iPoints app, which allows you to calculate points based on calories, fat and fiber.  Definately worth the money if you are serious about losing weight."
3302,3302,4,2016-01-07T15:43:01.000Z,Milaka83,Love it!!!!,"I just started using this app about 3 weeks ago. I always knew how to eat healthy, but this teaches you how to balance a meal. I was down 5lbs by the end of week 1. Not because I did anything out of the ordinary, I just kept better track of what I was putting in my body. I like that it links with the health app and automatically inputs movements in a day."

The fact that there are friends on Lifesum helps keep us motivated to log, and we can each other's food. if they didn't log, we sent each other reminders to do so. Our first day on Lifesum we were surprised on how many calories we usually eat and got many E and D ratings!!! Long story short, I lost 9 pounds in 4 weeks! Get this app if you don't already."

But needs ironing out.,"Lifesum has helped me to be more conscious of my eating habits, and gives me a greater sense of how many calories I am eating. However, the Apple Watch app doesn't always keep up with the iOS app; for example when I track water and exercise in the iOS app, the Watch app shows that haven't had any water and have not exercised at all! I'm not sure why this happens but it is a bit frustrating. There is a lot of potential in Lifesum, I suggest that the developers keep at it! I would recommend this for anyone who wants to eat better and drink more water."

3307,3307,4,2017-01-27T14:31:01.000Z,j.ruiz_isenberg,I'd love to love your app but..,"Unfortunately Myfitnesspal is light years ahead in the size of the foods database. I've given you guys a chance many times throughout time but the food database continues to be seriously underwhelming. While the app is beautiful, I much rather not have to enter foods and nutritional information manually as it takes much longer in time than I can afford which is the reason I've kept on renewing premium with Myfitnesspal.. Get your food and nutritional database to match Myfitnesspal and I'll switch over and go for your premium. In the meantime, bye bye again for now. :("
3308,3308,2,2017-07-08T13:51:57.000Z,Franklin fluffy pants,Calorie and weight tracker not working,"I saw the great reviews and started using the app a week ago. I was excited to use it but have been pretty disappointed with the glitches. 1. I have it synced to Apple health for steps, and on the day I walked 8000 steps, the app told me I burned about 200 calories. Then, the next day when my phone only recorded 2000 steps, the app said I burned 500. 2. I have been trying to record my daily weights, but instead of adding it into the chart as a new weight, it changes the starting weight. 3. The faces seem to have no correlation to the food I eat. It told me that grilled zucchini was bad but rice is ok? I'm debating whether to keep using this app or just switch to another one."
3309,3309,4,2017-08-06T02:37:37.000Z,ProudOfLouis,WAS IN LOVE ... until,"i was so ready to give this 5 stars and say how in love i am with this app, it's your average calorie counting app BUT IT ISNT . i have the free version because i'm broke but it's still amazingly helpful and way more aesthetically pleasing than other ones i've use, so that makes it easier and nicer to use. i'm terrible at drinking water , but the little water glasses filling up feels like a game to me, I NEED ALL OF THEM FILLED FOR THE DAY! but now after about a week of using it every single day, it's crashing and exiting the app when i try to click any of the features. please fix this i love this app so much ::(("
3310,3310,2,2013-10-17T13:31:52.000Z,Iceybales,Stupid update!,Ever since last nights update my app has been completely messed up. It has pushed everything a day back. Apparently i ate nothing yesterday  and what a actually ate yesterday it says i ate the day before. And it has doubled everything i have eaten. It's all on there twice so it messed up my averages and my goal date. And so i deleted it and redownloaded it hoping it would fix it but then it pushed everything back another day. So with the original day and this one everything is two days off.  And if i try to delete one of the doubles the next time i open it both the double and the one i left are gone. Fix your crap before you release it!
3311,3311,3,2015-01-05T14:19:57.000Z,Allie Jajoendn,Nice but could improve,"I am currently doing IIFYM and I really like that this app quickly shows my macros. However, I think there could be some improvement with tracking food. I think you should be able to quick add calories and carbs and protein so that if you go out to lunch and look up the nutrition, and they don't have it on the app, you can still track it. Also, the exercises could use some improvement. I like to track everything with my workout, like how many lunges I do and with what weight. That exercise is not on here, and it doesn't give me an option to create my own like My Fitness Pal does."
3312,3312,4,2015-05-12T09:59:02.000Z,NP-4752-7000,Impressive Improvement,"This update has really increased my motivation to track my meals and drink more water. I love the notifications and graphs! It's improved so much since its last update. My only concern is the lack in the food library. I've been using other resources to create my own foods and it doesn't have enough diversity in cuisine. Also, the built in step tracker is very inaccurate, which doesn't bother me as much because I have my own pedometer. But it can be inaccurate in calorie burn with its built in system or when adding my own exercises."

I tried counting calories with the app ""myfitnesspal"", but I always got frustrate or unmotivated to use it. With Lifesum, I'm excited to see how my macros are divided from my calories with a beautiful layout and encouragement!"
3314,3314,5,2016-02-04T22:44:50.000Z,Shelvasha,"Great, but a few suggestions...","I love this app and I am more successful with it than any other food tracking app out there. That being said, the food database needs to be expanded. Having to put in foods by hand can really be annoying. In addition, it doesn't sync my Nike+ workout (probably because it's a Runkeeper), even after it's exported to Apple's HealthKit. I really enjoy the grading system, but if the Lifesum team could work on those two things, it'd be enough for me to be a paying subscriber."

I'm not an expert not claim to be on nutrition, however, it has given me awareness in what I'm consuming  and makes me think twice about certain meals. Since I've started I've lost 9lbs in 3 weeks.  I love this app."
3316,3316,3,2016-09-18T00:18:15.000Z,Thenamesholes,Awesome concept with some flaws,"The app closed on me when I tried to make my own meal. I sadly paid for the year today without checking out some other apps too. The app does not help you figure out how to tweak your ideal carb, fat and protein intake or your calorie content - but if you're fine researching it yourself then it's very easy to adjust."

Not a lot of food info yet in the database so alot of the food I was eating had to be entered in manually. Overall it is a good app. Simple interface and easy to use. But not as detailed as the MFP app. Will give this a couple weeks of further use and update my review. But if you're looking for something simple and easy to track your calorie, fitness, and water intake. I do recommend this app."
3318,3318,5,2017-01-24T23:53:20.000Z,Paige349,An app that ACTUALLY works,"This app is a must get, whether you want to lose weight, gain weight, or simply eat healthier. It's easy to use and can connect with your health app to sync all data. It can send helpful notifications (only if you want), and it doesn't bombard you with ads. It allows you to input your entire diet on a day to day basis, and allows you to take quizzes to customize what you need in order to get your diet and body exactly how you want it. Plus, it's super fun to use. Overall, such a good app."
3319,3319,5,2017-07-31T17:16:53.000Z,Whittni33,Love Lifesum!,"I really love this app. It is the first all in one fitness and nutrition app that I have found with a great layout and ease of use. The way you can save your foods to favorites and it also pulls up recent foods saves so much time food logging, and I love that it automatically tracks workouts and steps through my Apple Watch. I wish the premium wasn't so expensive, being a college student it is hard to pay a monthly subscription but I feel like it would be worth it so I do want to try it soon! :)"
3320,3320,5,2008-08-27T23:49:30.000Z,dsm25,Outstanding!,"The weight loss program I'm following stresses journaling food intake and exercising.  iShape enables me to do that efficiently.  I don't care if I have to add some of my own foods.  I can put them in a Favorites list and access them again and again with ease.  I like that this app has macro-nutrient info as well as calorie info.  And best of all, before I decided to spend $10 on a app, I was able to visit the developer's web site and get a full video tour of the program.  Made the decision process a breeze."

You can also add your own foods & excercises. The other weight loss apps in itunes do not have all the features that ishape has, this is totally worth it! Since using it I have lost weight & I am on my way of meeting my goal."
3322,3322,5,2015-01-08T17:24:52.000Z,Passthepickles,Love this app!,"I wish I would have found this earlier. I had my last baby three years ago, and instead of losing weight after he was born like I did with my other two children, I have continued to gain and gain. This is the first thing I have found that actually works AND is convenient enough to use without it seeming like a hassle. It's motivating and it's helping. Three days in and I am already down four pounds. Great app- I paid for the gold version (subscription) and it is worth every cent. :)"
3323,3323,4,2015-11-05T15:30:47.000Z,lilliejl,Love it,"Ive used this app for a few years now to track various things - calorie intake, weight, & help get in the nutrition I want in the percentages of fat, carbs, & protein, plus track exercise. It's got it's flaws in that you have to dug around to find things sometimes, and i still have problems with trying to add a food & it telling me the food is already there, but I cant see it. But 98% of the time I'm pleased with this app & use it daily. Being able to plug in ingredients of a favorite recipe & not having to re-enter a portion each time is time saving."

I WANT to use this app. But the ux is cumbersome: a lot of extra clicks and taps and swipes to get your food added to your meals. Meal database is limited when using the search function compared to myfitnesspal or lose it. Adding weight should be available from the plus button so it's easily accessible at all times. Lastly, the ratings are strange. Oatmeal breakfast got a D and vegetable and chicken soup got an E (worst grade possible). I will give it a few more days but will probably switch back to myfitnesspal. Shame. Hope you guys can get things straightened out."

With this app, I was able to set myself up for success once I decided to change things for the better. I suggest it to anyone that needs a nudge in getting started with living a disciplined life.

I would like to see if it's for me, but I'm not paying the premium price to do that.  If I could buy maybe one single month then ....possibly.... But the lowest they go is over $8/mo for a three mo min.  That's over $24 just to try it for three months.  The full year is like $49."

I am losing weight with it.   This is the best I have ever used.    I like it better than weight watchers.   Wish it had more exercises but I manage with what the have.! Do not upgrade.   It is very inaccurate on its grading method of foods. Same item can be entered twice with different values.  Tap water is a bad choice because of too much sodium, salad dressing,  very poor guidance on which to choose."
3331,3331,2,2016-01-25T18:12:17.000Z,Rockboice,High hopes turned bad,This app was sent to me in an apple email. I was excited to use a calorie and nutrition app with my watch. I normally use fitness pal but it doesn't work with the Apple Watch. The layout it great I love how it rates the food and the easy dash board. I know it needs new members to add more food but it's a lot of work. And if you add a new food the measuring system is weird. A handful is not a good measurement. Also because I am going out to eat tonight I tried to put in my planned meal but nothing even close came up. At least with fitness pal I can usually get a pretty good idea of my meal based off of hundreds of other options. This app needs a lot of work

I like that you can track your daily, weekly, and monthly eating habits, exercise, and water intake. The app has reminders it sends you which is nice to help you stay on track. It seems pretty simple to use and is a helpful tool when used often. Overall, I enjoy using this free app which helps me stay more organized and progress in my short and long term goals of losing weight and becoming healthier. Thank you Lifesum!"

I feel very comfortable with my weight and the food that I have been eating. Also, the food and recipes that the app has recommended and provided me with taste delicious, are simple, quick, easy to make, and are extremely low in calories, carbs, and fat. I will be using and loving this app for years to come, and that it is a guarantee."

Woke up this morning, and now my diet plan changed, all my ratings for the past few weeks were significantly lowered. I looked at updating my diet plan, and when I found what was most like my original plan, now it is rating nearly every day as an ""A"" when there is no way that the lasagna I ate a few days ago should be an ""A"" meal on an LCHF plan!? Plus many meals or food options are reading ""(null)"" next to them when before it would read how carbs. Also, I miss my meals telling me my carb goal rather than a calorie goal for the diet I'm on... My subscription is up soon, so I may cancel of this what I am left with."

So in essence, this app integrates with Peloton. The barcode feature is really awesome. I can scan most items and it'll pull it from its directory. This saves a lot of trouble. The only draw back is when you go eat out and it's hard to record correctly (e.g. Korean BBQ). I have the premium version. Overall, I recommend and hope they continue to improve it. First heard about it from Megsquats."

I eat 6 times a day and smaller portions later on in the day. But this only has the option for breakfast, lunch, dinner and a snack. I love have beautifully it's designed and how easy it is to use. Also, I love the smiley face ratings, so cute! I would gladly pay for the year subscription if it would allow me to customize my meals and their calories a little more."

I looked at a lot of them and this one seemed to have pretty much everything I was looking for in the basic/free app. The only thing that we make it better is if the activity tracker actually synced w the apple watch tracker like it can w Jawbone and Misfit. And add a barcode feature for food labels. I don't think I've seen that yet, but it's only been 2 days. Thx guys and keep up the good app!"

Lifesum still doesn't have nearly as many options in that sense, but I love the recipes and the provided plans! Plus the little grading system is surprisingly really encouraging! I think with time, the app will really come together. And it actually isn't very expensive at all compared to other tracking apps!"
3347,3347,5,2017-07-12T02:32:03.000Z,lynoby,I love this app,I am so happy with the premium version of this app. I normally don't pay for apps but the additional features like offering recommendations for not only calories but also the macronutrients for the day makes it so much easier to eat right. Doing the questionnaire led to an eating plan that matched my needs perfectly. The tips are very helpful and the day rating are really helping me learn how to make better eating decisions. I definitely recommend!

You can still scan your food and it rates each of you meals so you can figure out your average day without paying to get that bonus. You don't get recipes with the free one, but that's no bother to me. The app is helpful and if you keep up with logging things in, then it really helps you at healthier.

I was surprised to find so much more available than just a good journal. I'm on a month of the premium membership and love the extra details provided in the ratings and the recipes I've tried have been fantastic. I've had a couple instances where the app has frozen up with bad timing but overall highly recommend it.

I'm Italian and I find food better than in My Fitness Pal. Same story when I buy food in Germany, the barcode reader always find the right food. Very good to manage your recipes, your favorites and frequent foods. If you cook your own meal with fresh ingredients this app is the best choice. Try the subscription plan just for 1 month to see what this app can do."
3351,3351,4,2016-01-13T05:47:35.000Z,Me not you,Good exercise app.... Not great,"It's great that it tracks your diet but doesn't do much to help you improve what you're doing. You set a goal, tells you how healthy the food you add is, and tracks your calories intake but gets annoying if you eat the same thing everyday and have to search for the same food. It would be helpful if they add a ""favorite"" list or an easier way to add the food you eat on a daily basis. Overall it's worth it if you have a little time to add your diet and info. Would recommend"
3352,3352,5,2016-05-14T13:17:30.000Z,40'something,A great App!!!,I have been using Lifesum for about 6 weeks. But is a simple free way to track what you are eating.  It syncs to the health app which will keep your weight and steps.  You can add exercise and activities which allows your to see what calories you have burned through the day.  The scanning tool is great for home as you prepare meals.  I would highly recommend this app for anyone looking for a easy and simple to use for beginning to get healthier!
3353,3353,1,2016-11-14T13:17:32.000Z,Frustrated Premium Member,Calorie counting completely off - Health App,Ever since last weekend the calorie count has been completely off. It appears that the Health app is syncing days from my Apple Watch and iPhone. There has to be a way to only count my Apple Watch the way MyFitnessPal does. I purchased the premium version of this app in October because I love having food plans. However ever since the update I'm frustrated that Lifesum is over-counting my calories and making it hard for me to leverage the great things about the app and making me do double the work by figuring out which exercise values I should be using. I would like to see a fix soon because I really do love this app when it works well.
3354,3354,5,2017-01-10T15:45:59.000Z,Tatiana11xo,User friendly.,"This makes dieting so much easier. Calorie counting, macro counting, clean eating, whatever you're into this makes it easier to do. Also helps you see how big potions should be. I love how it helps me keep track of my meals and what areas need improvement. One downside is that once you add your exercise it recalculates your goal for the day and that throws me off so now i do not add exercise and that helps me stay on track. Otherwise i love this app!"

It's super easy to track food with the barcode scanner! There's plenty of information about how I did on a particular day and everything. I love almost everything about this app. The only downer, for me, is that I haven't been able to add friend or family because of a strange glitch on the invite page. If the Lifesum crew were to fix this it would be the perfect app!"
3356,3356,4,2017-01-23T03:14:03.000Z,MissHabs97,Great but fix the bugs!,"I really enjoy this app. Even with the free version, I've managed to lose almost 15 pounds in about a month. It's really awesome at not only helping you with calories, but evaluating the overall quality of the food you eat. It's also very aesthetically pleasing. The only issue I have is that lately I can't log anything, because as soon as I finally find the food item, it crashes and takes me back to my home screen. Please fix this guys! I don't wanna have to stop using it."
3357,3357,5,2017-04-02T20:54:41.000Z,Smcleod2508,The free is totally fine,Lot of bad things said about the free access but I've been using this app for a month and have never had any issues! If you notice a discrepancy with nutrition info there is an option to connect your own set of info to the barcode as well! Remember this info is put in by other users and you should double check for accuracy on your own part. Works awesome for personal nutrition tracking!
3358,3358,3,2017-04-21T16:39:10.000Z,cbldavis,Work Around Needed for IOS 10.3.1,Let me start by saying this app is the best visual food diary apps developed. No other app comes close to what they have done. The point of a food diary is to want to use it to become more aware of what your eating. Lifesum has accomplished this for users. At this time the app is ill for anyone with Apple iOS 10.3.1.
3359,3359,3,2017-08-08T16:22:57.000Z,SadieBelle26,Buggy & too focused on weight loss,"Seems like a good app, but after only the second day of using, it's freezing up and crashing. Was already on the fence since so much of the data and motivation is focused on losing weight, no matter how I set it up. I don't want to lose weight, I'm working more towards a holistic process for pain management, taking into count WHAT I eat and how it can relate to pain/inflammation. It also seems to only share some data with the iPhone Health app. May try again with an updated version, but will keep looking for the right app."
3360,3360,5,2009-05-05T03:19:39.000Z,Niki Mulé,Best Calorie/Exercise Tracker,"I've tried many, even online, but this application has been an integral part of my daily life. It has enabled me to ""budget"" my calorie intake and adjust it for the desired results. So far, I've lost 18 pounds since I've started. To lose one pound a week, calculate your BMR (basal metabolic rate) and input your desired cals per day. Easy-peasy. Weight Watchers? Never tried, never will. Don't need it. This is the most basic tool you'll need for effective weight loss."
3361,3361,5,2010-03-15T05:01:47.000Z,losinweight,"Useful, best so far, needs bigger food database","I like this program. It's pretty user friendly. I believe it's worth the money. However, I don't like that grams is the default measurement system when entering foods. I want it to be ounces. It takes extra time entering foods. So, I would like the program to remember the amounts and units I usually enter for my favorites. That would reduce input time. Please put more national chain information in the database (i.e. fast food chains, restaurant chains)."
3362,3362,2,2016-08-07T16:02:34.000Z,Robyn171,Not a fan,"Pretty user interface and nice diet plan options but I'm ditching my premium subscription and going back to myfitnesspal. I have a ton of complaints- the Fitbit calorie adjustments are WAY off, they have a much smaller food database than MFP, you can't see all your food for the day on one screen, you can't easily import a recipe and when you try to adjust serving size it sometimes throws the calorie count off (my 1/2 c of yogurt is not 1,300 calories). I do like the diet plans, the meal grades, the look and feel, and the way they make carb and calorie recommendations by meal. But until the bugs are worked out its not useable."
3363,3363,2,2016-09-21T14:50:56.000Z,xLeaaaB,Everything needs to be FREE!!,"It's a great idea for the app, but the free version only limits you to so much stuff. If everything was free on this app, I believe that more people would use this app on their day to day basis. Especially since the app is to supports ""healthiness,"" why not just make everything free so more people can benefit from all the food plans and recipes?"
3364,3364,4,2017-01-20T15:11:26.000Z,Ashlizmcc,Pretty good. Emphasis on pretty.,"The app is very aesthetically appealing. It is easy to use. I use it to track my caloric intake and macros daily. The setup is great as well. The major downfall is the discrepancy in the food stats. For example, this morning I logged a fiber bar and the app says it was 120 calories when the box says it is 140. This can make a big difference in your results when it happens on a regular basis. Hopefully they will work it out so that the app is accurate because the app is really well done otherwise."
3365,3365,3,2017-05-19T19:57:27.000Z,zbju,Step counter needs attention,"I have found this app very useful and I am on it daily. One concern is that the calories burned from steps (synced from Health) vary wildly from day to day. One day may be 2000 steps and 888 calories burned while another will be 6000 steps and 31 calories burned. It is inconsistent and inaccurate. This should be addressed. I will echo others concerns with inability to add foods and exercises. You must rely on logged activities with questionable calories burned, or food with fishy nutritional info. If these issues were solved there would be absolutely no complaints. All in all, a good app."

Integrates well with the Apple Health app, one of the few apps that seems to be fairly accurate with nutrition information. Versatile diet options with the paid membership. Speaking of the paid membership, it is a little pricy at almost $50 a year, not sure if the paid membership is worth it."
3367,3367,4,2017-08-03T18:18:19.000Z,ZELLA!!!,Great for tracking macros!,"This app is fantastic because it allows your to adjust your macro intake to your specific needs, even on the free version. Though, I think it would be awesome if they adjusted the water tracker so that you can input the fluid ounces rather than the set 8oz or 16oz because various water bottles hold different amounts. I also think it would be great if you could update your water intake on the Apple Watch app. The suggested recipes are also delicious, even the low card options!"
3368,3368,4,2017-08-17T21:39:06.000Z,ClaireFutrell,"Good App, but could have more customization.","I really enjoy this app (especially the recipe section). It's easy to use and visually pleasing. My one suggestion would be to allow more customization with your macronutrient goals, especially per meal. I always get enough fat and carbs throughout the day, but my meal ratings are often imbalanced."

Not only does it correctly calculate your BMR and how much you actually need to eat (a concept so easily lost with people-it's more than you think!!) but it is a visually pleasing set up to show you your goals compared to your current  eating and exercise. The only room I see for improvement here is more eating plans. Especially when you're a paying customer. There's a few, but I'd really like to see a ""bulking"" and a ""cutting"" plan. Simple!"

The app helps me to keep track of EVERYTHING that goes into my mouth, and the exercise that I'm getting on my treadmill.  I've lost 5 pounds since I started using the app, and I don't have a Shape-up account.  It's very easy to use.  I could go on and on about what I love about this app.  I just find it the perfect solution to changing my lifestyle."

The app continuously changes my age for whatever reason. My selected diet resets to standard every hour or so. Water/food tracking from Apple Watch doesn't work at all."

I feel it does a better job at helping me prepare for my future meals instead of eating, entering, and realizing I went over. Haven't used it for more than a week so I can't say I've lost weight on it yet, but I love the water reminder, and the free version is already very useful! I can only imagine that with all the paid features you would be set up for success!!"

I have been trying to lose those additional ""Christmas"" pounds and was looking for an app that would give me that motivation. Not only has this app helped me lose those additional pounds, but it had given me awesome tips and they make it easy to track the food that you eat without counting the calories your self. I love the notifications too! Helps remind me to drink more water, which I don't do enough. Obsessed."

Most importantly you can't set your macronutrient goals, so if Lifesum thinks you should have 35% carbs there's nothing you can do about it. Also their product data base is much worse and less accurate than MyFitnessPal's. Lastly, it doesn't always make sense, like when each individual meal is under my protein target for that meal, yet I am over my protein target for the day. It's a shame such a nicely designed interface is going to waste."
3375,3375,4,2016-11-10T10:00:33.000Z,Angry demographic,Pretty good,"This is a calorie counting tool which came recommended by CGP Grey. Assuming most of your meals come from the grocery store, you can easily scan product bar codes and log what you're eating. You can in some cases look up fast food, too. There's more functionality if you pay money for the upgrade but my free experience has been fine. I do wish they'd better develop the exercise tracker but just pulling walking data from my phone does well to show what I burn daily."

It's really convenient to have everything all in one place and I love the visual for fruit and veggie tracking and the quick summary that keeps me on track throughout the day.  Meal feedback has been very useful in making small tweaks and improvements each day.  👍👍

If this team cares about ALL of the people who use and recommend their app, they should stop constantly limiting functionality for those who don't pay."

No crashing. No bugs. Clean interface. Worth every penny."

I'll be testing this app to see how well it complements my lifestyle. The free version is very good and the Gold membership features seem well worth the price. I only wish that they will add support for the Garmin line of fitness tracking devices. That would be amazing, considering that I use a Garmin Vivoactive; not any of the devices currently supported. 4 stars; 5 if/when they add Garmin support!"

Also I would love maintenance so that people can't put the same item or foods twice. Makes it very cluttered and hard to know which one is accurate. If Lifesum can get a team to keep the items people add accurate and organized; so that once there's an item added correctly, It can't be resubmitted, that would be great!"
3383,3383,4,2016-04-22T18:10:50.000Z,spilwill,"Simple, easy calorie tracking",This is a great app for simple and easy calorie tracking. They've done a good job getting big food brands in their app for more accurate tracking. I don't agree with how they add calories back into your diet after working out but really that's my only criticism. I can't really even complain there because without paying for the service it's more a personal calorie tracker than anything and its great for that. The water reminders are awesome too!

It takes the work out of calorie counting, tracks exercise, suggests recipes, helps set goals for nutrient distribution, tracks water consumption, and lays everything out on an easy-to-use interface. My frustrations are that it doesn't have every single food accurately graded (which I'm sure will get better in the future) and there are typos in some of the recipes. I would highly recommend this app!"

With many healthy meals, I still get a C or D rating, simply because my portions aren't large enough to fit the magic number required by Life Sum. When trying to loss weight and find what lifestyle modifications work best, this is extremely discouraging. I'm very disappointed that the company still has not taken this into consideration especially with how many people have complained about this in previous updates."

I've always been heavier then most people, and I didn't feel good in my body. So I went out in search for some fitness apps. I looked online and a YouTuber that I like watching suggested LifeSum. So I tried it out and I love all the great features you get even without paying. The only con is, I wish you could get more features without paying money. Other than that, I love it!"

"" etc. I just think it's annoying that there's so many things that you can't use or see without having the premium. That's too exclusive and you should be able to see more, it makes people not want to use something when they can't use half the app without paying monthly."

Some days it's smooth and easy to record meals, other days it sticks and crashes, bringing my iPhone 7 Plus to a screeching halt.

What might be useful would be some type of nutrient tracker as well (vitamins, minerals). I am a vegetarian and it's difficult for me to recognize which nutrients i'm lacking. But this is a weight loss tracker after all, so it's not entirely necessary, I guess."
3391,3391,5,2013-02-06T15:40:50.000Z,Happylai,Great Calorie Counter App,I love this app the most because you submit your target weight and it gives you a set calorie limit and how many wks it could take if u stick with your calorie intake. The only thing I would change is maybe having to pay for full access but the limited works fine for me. I have been using this app for 11wks and have lost 27lbs so far so I highly recommend this app.

If I go back to the app or close and reopen the app the same thing happens. I can't do anything on it now because it's so buggy, but when it's not, it's a great app."
3396,3396,5,2016-12-05T03:30:13.000Z,Babvkitten,Love it!!,I recommend this to all my friends looking to eat more healthily! It's so great at getting you to alter what you eat to be better for your body with the way it grades you. The key to benefiting from the app is logging what you're going to eat before you eat so you have time to rethink your choices if they generate a low grade. Overall I find the app much more health oriented than other similar apps.

3402,3402,2,2015-06-20T17:09:50.000Z,Abit-ti-tar,Awful for tracking carbs,A lot of the carb counts are wrong. This is a very big deal if counting carbs. So with those wrong I question everything and have to look at other sources so I end up not using the app for that. It also has lots of names brand and restaurant food. Which makes looking up just basic raw food you cook or prepare at home a chore. If you already do not eat processed foods and rarely eat out this app becomes tiresome. On a good note they said they would refund my gold account since I contacted them right away and the one good thing I like is drunk water reminders.

Also when you add an item, it also puts half the info you put in behind the paywall too. You can't even view nutrition info that YOU PUT IN. Also when I scan a barcode, app says it's not in the db but after I spend time entering all the info, it says it already exists! So frustrating! Two stars for app and UI design only. Functionality usefulness is next to nothing."
3404,3404,5,2016-05-05T20:04:38.000Z,Zesty wings,Great app that could be more!,Really love the app! It really gives a visual way of tracking calories and your diet rather than having to just put numbers. I was maybe thinking of adding a budgeting part of the app because we all know how costly it can be to eat healthy. So adding maybe a price range or just by putting how much each meal cost could be a benefit to healthy living and saving money.
3405,3405,5,2016-07-22T21:41:59.000Z,Bigdogs83,Love it,Life sum really helps me stay on track.  It has you take a quiz and configures a diet plan that works for you. I like how it encourages me with little reminders throughout the day to drink more water and if you haven't been very active.  I so far have lost about 20 # in about a month
3406,3406,1,2016-08-16T13:11:34.000Z,AbraxasTrevor,Do not pay for this app.,"Not worth the money at all. The # of recipes is laughable and you're better off just using Yummly. The meal and day rating system is generic (not tailored to the plan you're on as is implied during the sales pitch, very vague and not helpful). The scan barcode feature to register food items almost never has the food items in the system and in the rare event it does the nutritional facts are always wrong. I have to spend a ridiculous amount of time manually inputting the nutritional facts for each ingredient I use. Basically, you are paying to build up the database for them. Very unhappy customer."

Only downside is that if you want to keep it free, you have to deal with TONS of ads telling you to get the paid app not only in the app but through emails as well. It would be much smoother without the ads but I'm not paying monthly just for those to go away."

It would be nice to have more freedom to just enter caloric intake on some items rather than to have to estimate oz's etc. till I get close to the actual calorie amount.  I keep close tabs on what I am eating - and watch labels.  I would be able to enter more precisely what i've eaten if the app allowed.
3412,3412,5,2009-03-30T21:09:47.000Z,Jusco,Works great!,I've used it for about a month now and it works great. It all depends on how much you're willing to put into it. It can be a bit tiring putting in how many calories you eat every meal but it's eye opening when you realize just how many calories certain foods have.
3413,3413,2,2011-12-18T18:57:03.000Z,newnewbie,No longer free,"I have had this for a few years BUT when I got a new phone & had to download it again significant parts REQIRE you to join their ""shape up clu"". I wrote to them but have received no reply."
3414,3414,2,2016-05-15T14:04:48.000Z,bnjmarquis,Just downloaded it,Well I downloaded this thinking it looks like a pretty cool app but I can't really do anything with out paying. And its reoccurring payments but there isn't anyway to turn off automatic payments on the app.  I would rather have a free trial before fully committing to something I've never used. I would however like if the app had a lifetime buy. Where you pay for it once and that's it. I don't want to pay for months or years. I would like it if they made a free trail for this before I invest money into it. I can't even look at the recipes. 🙁
3415,3415,5,2016-05-15T16:14:31.000Z,FiddyFit,"Lost 19 lbs in 5 wks--and counting, literally","Lifesum works better than any other food tracking app I've tried. Love how it supports different diets with guidelines, suggestions, macronutrient targets and good recipes (although some recipes need to be rewritten for clarity and/or missing steps or ingredient amounts). I've tried eating Ketogenic before, but this is the first time I've had success with it, because of Lifesum's encouragement and knowledgeable guidance."
3416,3416,1,2016-07-06T17:53:43.000Z,BlindPhoenix,Accessibility Lacking for VoiceOver Users,"I love the promise Lifesum for iOS holds out; but since its developers consider requests by users who are blind to make the app accessible as feature requests to be voted upon according to overall popularity and awareness of the issue, I can't actually use the app The developers' attitude toward accessibility, seeing it as an additional feature that might be nice rather than an essential element of good design, means that the company loses customers because of its effectively discriminatory attitude, and that people like me, who rely on VoiceOver and accessibly designed apps, can't benefit from the promise of Lifesum's otherwise enlightened approach to wellness."
3417,3417,5,2016-08-30T07:58:48.000Z,Patrbai12,FRIENDLY USE app,"Great app to keep on track your food and water intake as well as mark the amount of workout exercised per day. You can scan the barcode of almost every food available to get accurate info on calories, fat etc..The app allows you to customize your PERSONAL GOALS. Easy to use. I wish some of the recipes could be for free as a sample to see whether to upgrade or not :)"
3418,3418,2,2017-01-05T01:37:52.000Z,Jab-OH,Broken,"I tried Lifesum for a few days instead of my usual trackers. I liked the interface and layout. I also liked how it broke out vegetables and fruit instead of just calories like other apps. It made you focus on a balanced diet. Now to the negatives. The ""health algorithm"" for meals is broken. I get a poor rating for a healthy salad with tuna but Hostess cupcakes and combos get the highest rating for a snack? Today the app started crashing after exactly 8.2 seconds from opening. You could use the regularity to set a watch. I chose to delete and return to my normal, less colorful, app."
3419,3419,3,2017-07-28T02:30:18.000Z,gracie and aj,Easy to Use fun app,"My boyfriend and I love this app. We are both very competitive and thought downloading a fitness app would be a good idea -  that it would push us both to eat healthier - and we were right. My only issue is the free version has barely any features. It track our food, gives basic recipients and remembers my weight and that's about it. I wish there was a test trial to see if we would like to buy the premium version. 25$ is a steep chance to pay for a college student ya feel?"
3420,3420,4,2008-08-11T18:00:56.000Z,lyclpz1,It is actually a good app to have,"Even though that it is an application that I can't used supposedly because of my height and weight, thid app doesn't give me the accurate BMI.  However, it is a very good design.  I had the chance to play with it and I like the graphics and it has many exercises available.  I hope in a future update there is a fix for the BMI Calculation.  Overall, excellent application to keep track of your calories and exercises."
3421,3421,3,2009-01-03T13:04:10.000Z,LAW-GSO,Like this so far,"I have only been using this app for a couple days.  It is easy to add additional food items.  It does seem to have a little math difficulty (I entered two beverages at 4 calories each, and it is showing the total so far as 7?)  It would be nice if they would add a place to enter cholesterol, if you are watching that in your diet as well.  For under a dollar, it's a good little ap to keep careful track of your calories - something I have never been able to do with any consistency!"
3422,3422,4,2009-11-29T17:49:06.000Z,fdlgrl,Works,"Of course it works. The most comprehensive weight loss studies show that measuring calories out vs. calories in is the best way to lose weight. I've lost 5 pounds the first week and a half by keeping careful count. I would like to suggest getting verifications on nutritional information input by users. There are some numbers that are wildly off and I edit them when I can, but it makes a tedious process (counting calories) even more time-consuming."
3423,3423,5,2014-05-31T23:36:49.000Z,Belrogamy,Simply crashes,"As others have said, this app just crashes upon opening. Specifically, when I attempt to enter my dob. I can enter all the other information just fine, and even let it sit open for a little while, but as soon as I attempt to enter my birthday, bam! It's crashed. The app looks good, though, so I'm going to keep it on in the hopes that a fix is on the way!"
3424,3424,5,2015-12-31T05:05:18.000Z,Ess713,I love it!,I have done MyFitneesPal and it was pretty good but I love this one because it's a simple clean design and very user friendly. You can do the free version or choose to do one of the paid options. I am doing the $3.33 a month program and I get great recipes and tips that really take the app to the next level. And you can also taper your suggestions for different types of dies and lifestyles. It's a great app!
3425,3425,4,2016-03-18T15:16:58.000Z,Gosox997,Great app,"This app is pretty cool!!! I recently lost a lot of weight and I needed something to keep the weight off, the water reminder is cool. The only issue is the connection to my Apple Watch. It seems like there is a bug somewhere that's preventing me from updating and it keeps reminding me even when I click dismiss. However, I am continuing to use this app every day. Also the food recommendations are awesome and I've tried a few of them and they taste amazing!"
3426,3426,4,2017-01-11T01:20:27.000Z,tomatillo22,Great app for the most part,"He app is awesome and the interface I find to be much cleaner and more attractive than myfitnesspal. Premium appears to offer a bunch of neat diet plans and the app will help you see how well your meals are in line with your chosen diet. However, I don't like that you can't even track basic nutrition information like the sodium of a meal without premium. Myfitnesspal beats them on that. All in all though I like the app and will continue to use it."
3427,3427,5,2017-02-28T20:59:19.000Z,Cooperererrr,New Update Won't Sync and Crashes,"Since installing the new update the app refuses to sync with my Fitbit and while this has been solved by logging out and back in, the last time I did that it completely corrupted a day to where it wouldn't boot up until the next day and every time I try to access the bad day the app crashes. Very disappointed by the new update!"
3428,3428,5,2017-08-14T20:35:48.000Z,A2theE2theB,Great tool,"I really enjoy this, especially that you can scan an item. I feel like their calorie expenditure is off on the workout side- the treadmill/elliptical says one number and this app says another. It makes you miss out on food! I have been telling everyone this app has changed my life, and I mean it. I LOVE THIS APP!!!"
3429,3429,5,2017-08-18T02:46:01.000Z,edlaurs,Highly recommended to get fit LOVE THIS APP,"This app is so much more than just counting calories which wasn't my aim to begin with, it also keeps in mind carbs protein and fat while creating a personalized plan for you. The quiz at the beginning was so accurate and I've been eating so much better even after a couple days. Never thought I would be able to do it."
3430,3430,2,2010-08-04T04:09:45.000Z,Aakaash,Shape Up,"The old version of shape up was great and probably my most used app as a bodybuilder. The update removed custom water intake, pie charts, and entering anything takes an extra step."
3431,3431,5,2015-03-30T17:46:52.000Z,BaileyKelley,Love this App,"Lifesum has been super easy to navigate and enter all information. It has a lot of information about recipes and foods for you to stay informed. I also really love that it keeps track of your water intake and reminds you to drink more! It's really cool that Lifesum also gives you charts for your daily intake of protein, carbs, etc.. This has been the easiest app for me to keep up with so far."
3432,3432,5,2015-05-20T02:06:16.000Z,Peachies7,Almost The Best,I absolutely adore this app and I just started using it a little while ago. I find it to be both visually appealing and easy to use. The only thing I ever wished an app like this had was the ability to put blog posts or information into the app and look at it for inspiration or advice and exercises. Like how you can use the app pocket to save or bookmarks things you like.
3433,3433,2,2016-04-04T03:36:49.000Z,bob124324,"weak app, better ones available","The app is extremely simple, making it almost unnecessary for any diet, but it could help for simple weight loss. Any function besides just tracking calories and making a bad preset goal is locked behind the gold version. Ive used Myplate for a long time now and that works much better, it allows me to customize my goal calories and my own macros, while having a simple to use and decently sized archive of foods. This app has potential, but it is far too basic for most people who care about their nutrition."
3434,3434,5,2016-05-01T05:54:25.000Z,WalterXavs,Wonderful app,"This is one wonderful app! Very neat and nicely arranged features, and 60+% off if you purchase for one year! It is considerate for your health and help you build health. Really reminds me of a lot of foods that would help me!!! Keep getting better and better by widen the range of it so I can easily obtain food recommended in MY region, Chinese and Indian and Mexican people can find it hard to obtain food recommended!"
3435,3435,1,2016-06-19T10:58:17.000Z,Done widdit,Uninstalled,"My favorite is when the calories burned goes backwards. Now I'm suddenly allowed 700 extra calories in my diet? Nutritional information relies on individual input, which is often (read almost always) inaccurate. Not sure why sausage and egg on an English muffin has an ""A"" rating and a steak and lettuce wrap gets a ""D."" Also math is wrong - my breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack can each be 200 calories under individually and my overall calories will only be 200 under. This app is getting worse. Not reading calories burned from my tracking app. Walked the city yesterday and it says 3 calories burned. Customer support are boneheaded."
3436,3436,5,2017-01-25T02:09:51.000Z,Thfit,Beautiful + Functional App,"Discovered this app after hearing about it from a few of my favorite YouTubers. Lifesum is a beautifully designed app. The interface is highly functional with loads of customizable features. Perfect app for those looking for support in living a healthy lifestyle. I love that you can adjust the nutrition tracking tools, track water intake and workouts all in one place!"
3437,3437,5,2017-02-04T06:01:37.000Z,NickiDominates,Great App,"This is a great app, it's sad to see it compared to myfitnesspal (which didn't even let me register smh) since Lifesum deserves more credit. It's really helpful when tracking calories, and I just started the free trial which has helped me balance the nutrition distribution in my meals and be smarter about eating choices. Please download this it's much better than any other nutrition or ""diet"" apps I've used."
3438,3438,3,2017-07-18T17:53:01.000Z,Shanwing,It's hard to tell...,"I think I would like this app, if I could do more with the free version.  Everything I want to look into makes me buy premium.  I don't want to invest if I don't like it.  Right now, I'm ready to uninstall after trying it for less than a day because MyFitnessPal gives me more options in the free version.  I think this app would be better than MyFitnessPal in the premium, but I can't tell.  A trial run would be nice, but until I know, I'm going to stick with MyFitnessPal."
3439,3439,4,2017-08-03T21:44:54.000Z,Luckylexy18,Very user friendly,This is the only calorie tracking app that I have stuck with. The beautiful interface makes it seem like less of a chore to log all of your food and exercise. I use the premium and I love how personalized it is on all fronts. I can edit my macros and it offers recipes that fit my dietary restrictions. I think it could improve in an area or two so I gave it 4 stars but overall I love this app. It's really changed the game!!
3440,3440,5,2009-03-03T05:31:55.000Z,pixellava,Great for Gainers too!,"I love this app! I am coming back from some health issues and have been using ShapeUp Club to help eat more balanced, healthy meals and GAIN weight. I especially love the water tracker - that was why I bought it in the first place. The charting is great, love the before and after photo, I use it all day long! Excellent job developers! Thank you, your app is really, really making a difference in my life.."
3441,3441,3,2015-08-01T23:41:34.000Z,lml277,Disappointed...,"I paid $40 for a one year subscription but this app needs some work.  Please convert recipe and food measurements to the country in which the user lives.  I hope there are plans to add some sort of a recipe builder so that the carbs, fat and protein can be calculated for healthy recipes outside the app.  Also, I've had daily issues with Lifesum syncing with my Fitbit.  Sometimes it records my steps and sometimes it doesn't.  Very frustrating... With some improvements, I would give it 5 stars."
3442,3442,4,2017-02-02T17:55:53.000Z,Burtyyyg,Awesome app!,Lifesum has really helped me put in perspective what is going into my body and how much I was really consuming. It also motivates you to work out and burn more calories especially if you have eaten over what you should have that day. To see your overconsumption go down just by working out it makes you feel accomplished. It's a great app and I would recommend it to even those who aren't watching their weight.
3443,3443,5,2017-03-02T23:28:35.000Z,SallyMonster,Love it! Easy & teaches healthy eating,"Super easy to log food. Visually delightful. Lifesum makes it really easy to learn about the nutrient balance of my meals. It tailors your calorie and nutrient guidelines based on your current weight, height, goals, etc. I have it pulling activity data from my apple watch so it adds caloric needs based on that day's activity level."

I love the interface of this app, it's so cute and helpful and the little tips somehow feel more personalized (""you're going to crave carbs if you're stressed this weekend, try taking it easy"") than my fitness pal or spark people. The meal plans are great and overall just really enjoy the app. Only thing is I wish they had more recipes up and indoor workouts you can do at home."
3445,3445,3,2017-05-26T21:16:07.000Z,SpiritSoul11,Vegetarian....hello?,"I do not understand why this app does not understand that I am a vegetarian after indicating that I do not eat fish meat eggs or other sources begotten of cruelty.  Why does it still insist, to recommend recipes with fish and meat? One can eat a healthy diet without killing sentient beings. I would love to take advantage of the other diets, but I am forced to use the classic die because the other ones insist that I eat meat.  After this free trial, there will be no premium subscription for me, until the developers figure this out."
3446,3446,4,2017-06-15T20:14:07.000Z,notmontana70,App has helped me change my eating habits,"This app gives clear view of how many calories I'm consuming and the amount of each macronutrient I'm consuming. Also helps track water, exercise, vegetables, fruits, and fish. I also appreciate the different diet plans you can choose from when a premium member. Last but not least is the weight loss. I've lost over 30 pounds since I started with this app in March 2017."
3447,3447,4,2017-07-12T16:31:26.000Z,bighousegoblue,Great App But....,"I do think this app takes the cake in interface department. Easy to use, the layout is great. I wish some of the things in the premium version were a part of the free version. Some things won't sync unless you pay for the premium, you don't get some of the details of your full days tracking without premium. Signed up for the 30 day free trial of premium and makes a world of difference I think."
3448,3448,5,2017-08-01T16:48:48.000Z,BaseballLefty6,Helpful App,"Started using this app a while ago to help when I started back working out and trying to cut down before vacation. Paired it with fitbod workout app to track both food and workouts since I don't have a Fitbit or Apple Watch and it works great. Wish there was a little more variety/customizations in some of the diet plans, but overall a very solid app"
3449,3449,2,2017-09-05T03:12:48.000Z,tawkinhedz,Plagued by bugs since day one,"Notice every release emphasizes how they've fixed all the bugs. This app will never improve because they keep focusing on useless things like recipes. I just want it to track my meals and i dont want to pay to track unsaturated fats! Recipe inputs are complicated, but once you get used to it very versatile."
3450,3450,5,2013-02-25T15:12:34.000Z,Marti127,Easy to use,Great program. Easy to use and track meals. There is a place for personal recipes to be stored and edited if needed. The free version really is nice. I chose to update because it included so much more. Ive lost weight because of this program. Its hard to eat on the run when ive committed to track my meals and the ease of the program on my phone meant success for me. This app works.
3451,3451,5,2015-10-08T00:49:21.000Z,Aaaaaalice199222ee,Helping out a lot with meal planning,This app has been awesome so far! I've only had it three days now but it really has helped to keep me more on track with what I consume and when I consume it. I especially love the water feature that tracks how many cups of water you drink. I could definitely see this helping me with fitness goals well into the future! 🙌🏽🍌✨

The format of this app is great and I like that aspect a lot. However, the rating system is very, very poor. How can coconut oil be rated an ""E"" or an organic fully green juice a ""D""? It seems this app takes data from the early 90's to rate the food rather than current nutritional information. There should be an option to turn off the rating system as it has me questioning my meal choices when, in reality, they're some of the healthiest options."

I love that it can accommodate my celiac disease/lactose intolerance. (Can't have bread or milk) and how accurate the products are. I like how easily you can add products that aren't there. I kind of wish I had the paid stuff for free, but that's kind of the point. 10/10. 😊"
3455,3455,1,2016-10-18T05:15:48.000Z,KTBell13,Not for broke people,"This app seemed very nice and very simple to use. It looked like a great tool to start helping me try and become healthier all around. I created an account knowing that there were parts that required payment to use, but I assumed that still meant I could use most of the features. I was wrong. With not spending any money, I couldn't do very much or track very much. I didn't even keep the app for very long because almost everything I clicked on was something I had to pay for. I'm a college student that can't afford to spend any extra money. Overall a disappointment."

After using this app for a few months I continue to experience the same issues over and over: my date of birth keeps changing, my weight keeps changing and my goal calorie intake keeps changing to ridiculous values. I also noticed that a lot of the nutritional values for commercial foods are incorrect. I'm also disappointed that it doesn't connect to Strava."
3458,3458,3,2017-08-08T18:47:08.000Z,frustrated km,Like app but...,I purchased the premium version of Lifesum on 7/29. I downloaded it on my iPad but cannot get the premium version on my iPhone without it needing to upgrade to premium. Anyone else have that problem? I've deleted it on both devices and reinstalled. I do not have more than one apple I.d. or account so that's not the issue. I've wasted literally hours trying to figure this out. Appreciate some help installing the premium Lifesum without paying another premium upgrade.

I depend on it immensely to count my macros, track my water intake, and (sort of) track calories burned. I do have to say that the calories burned might need some work because I don't think it's super accurate. I wish the app had more foods available to choose from but otherwise, I love it."

They don't always seem quite reliable or correct. I like that you can choose between a couple different diets (for premium users). Nice look and easy to use to stay on track with your diet!"
3461,3461,5,2015-11-21T14:15:23.000Z,Some Irish fella,You need this,"Great app. The upgrade is well worth the extra though. I thought ""no way do I need to spend $8 per month on this""... As I drank a $9 whiskey at a bar. Perspective kicked in. A surprisingly large number of restaurants and food retailers have already inserted their specific data for you so your food diary is extremely specific."
3462,3462,5,2015-12-18T19:34:07.000Z,Mari.Jo.,Makes me want to get an A,I've tried other apps that just count calories but that doesn't do anything for me. I love that it grades you for each meal/the day. If I get a low grade on my breakfast it motivates me to pull myself together the rest of the day so I can get an A or B!! Preferably an A! I've tried other apps that just track calories but that doesn't do anything for me.

I liked that you could set the number of pounds you wish to lose/gain, as other apps don't and they pick by their best option. This really made me think about how I eat and how important it is to get an A! ;)"
3464,3464,5,2016-09-09T00:09:54.000Z,Itssarakang,I usually don't bother to write reviews,...but this app is sooo handy especially for a young college student who does not know much about portion control and nutrition value!! I'm trying to lose the weight I gained from freshman year and I'm surprised I found an app I like more than Fitnesspal and Lose It! I'm even considering paying to upgrade to Gold/Premium version of this. Looove this app!

I've tried to track my food before and have always given up but this makes it easy and not feel like a chore. The food library is huge and has everything I eat. It's super comprehensive to know what I'm putting in my body. I only have the free account but am thinking of upgrading.
3467,3467,4,2017-02-04T18:42:38.000Z,Ckpointe11,Easier to add recipes,"I am really enjoying this app. The way it looks and function are both mostly great, however, it would great to be able to add your own recipes and foods from the home screen. It doesn't make sense to have to go through ""add to my diary"" to get to favorites when I'm actually just adding recipe and not to my diary. And it may not be a favorite either. To simply add a recipe would be more ideal."
3468,3468,4,2017-03-28T15:35:10.000Z,HoneyB925,Needs to be fine-tuned,"It has made a huge difference in my eating habits, but the calorie tracking is questionable. It doesn't let me add my own nutritional information or at least let me import the info from a recipe I used online (one that wasn't provided by the app). That would make things helpful. All in all, the interface is great and I enjoy tracking the water, veggies, exercises, and meals that I eat daily."
3469,3469,4,2017-06-01T17:26:41.000Z,visiobsbycara,I love the app....,I love this App! I wanted to give it 5 stars BUT there are a few reasons why I couldn't bring myself to do it. The first is that it's was spendy. $45 A YEAR to get the plan I wanted and one of the main reason I buy the bullet and bought it was for the recipes and there honestly weren't enough to justify the price. 😕
3470,3470,5,2008-08-08T17:16:49.000Z,xxjt123xx,Great App.,"This app is great. Really well designed and looks great. The database is full of preloaded foods helps getting started. It is very user friendly and some features that help you analyze the data you have input into the app. This company is really responsive to emails, support, and seems like they want input. I would recommend to others and buy again."
3471,3471,3,2008-09-13T19:51:25.000Z,CnC Pocket Protocols,"Other Diets: Nutirsystem, Jenny Craig, etc.",This is a very helpful application. I have tried all the applications that iPhone offers regarding nutrition and diet plans. All have their pros and cons.
3472,3472,3,2008-10-20T00:54:54.000Z,jimmyjabe,iShape,"Good start on a potentially great program for a food/exercise diary, but some tweaking and bugs need to be addressed. Entering data for food items can be frustrating and confusing. For example, entered data disappears when moving to another field. The diary page is way too busy! It needs to be simplified. The database is quite inadequate and lists many food items I've never heard of.  But, I bought it and hope that improvements are made in the near future."
3473,3473,1,2015-12-06T10:41:11.000Z,Mau'ra,Not worth it,"I have long used Loseit. But I decided to give this one a try because of the Apple Watch compatibility. These app does not play well with others though. It links with up, but wasn't actually pulling data. It barely communicates with Apple Health. It could write weight and water, but could not read anything and could not write food. The one thing it's for."

3475,3475,3,2016-08-05T05:32:27.000Z,Lynnyousosilly,Needs improvement,Signed up for gold and was bummed to see all the recipes using the metric system as well as British lingo (aubergine for eggplant). Existing recipes use ingredients that are not all readily available at my nearby grocer. Recipes are also limited and food database limited vs other apps. Would be nice to have an option to see what would be a healthier option before we ingest the food. I.e. Scan a cookie and then an alternative pops up or a recipe. UX is def warmer and design is beautiful.
3476,3476,4,2017-02-24T05:15:03.000Z,amiakiko,One dangerous detail,"This is a clever app with great graphics but I am alarmed at how it seems to encourage undereating. I have it set to the ""maintain weight"" setting, but the best daily ratings I get are on days when I go to bed hungry. The best day rating I've gotten so far, I was 500 calories under the recommended value. Please fix this -- as a person who has struggled with being underweight in the past, this feature makes me very nervous."
3477,3477,4,2017-06-04T23:22:37.000Z,Jester42242,Love,"I absolutely love this app, I bought it after a month of trial. I love that it helps me really keep track of all the exact grams of things I'm eating. With out it living a keto lifestyle would be impossible. I love the new step counting feature. I would love if the tips and words of encouragement would vary more, it would be nice if there was an accompanying blog or community for all the lifesum people to communicate with each other on."
3478,3478,4,2017-06-26T17:23:25.000Z,NeedABudgetNow,Love this app,"I've tried other apps for food tracking and didn't stick with any very long. I love the ""reward"" of getting the smiley face when I make healthy choices and it encourages me to stick with it. For some reason today the app keeps crashing. Which is frustrating bc I use it multiple times every day. Will definitely upgrade to 5 stars once the glitch is fixed. 😊"
3479,3479,4,2017-07-06T17:06:56.000Z,NoFreshman15,Great for Anyone!,"I'm an upcoming college freshman. I'm very fit but want to keep it that way and this app is really helping me. I take medication that messes with my appetite so this app really helps let me know when I need to eat, what I need to eat, etc. You don't need to be a bodybuilder or nutritionist to find this app useful. It's a great way for you to become more familiar with how you're fueling your body! I highly recommend it to anyone."
3480,3480,3,2009-01-19T21:29:14.000Z,pnutpusher,Please update with these capabilities !!!!,I would say this app is between a 3 and 4 star > I wish is had a better search. I use it for weight watchers and I wish it had a point calculator built in  !!!! and I wish you could manually add  food and points > like for breakfast I have kellogs corn flakes with strawberries and I know its 2 points instead of having to go to all the trouble of searching and getting a very generic answer . If it had these 2 capabilities it would be a 5 star !!!!
3481,3481,1,2014-04-27T03:04:28.000Z,Mjm572,Had to request my money back,"I purchased the full version so that I could sync with the Moves app. BAD DECISION. This app is insufferably glitchy. The biggest of which is that you can enter a food and have no idea what date the app will log it in. Could be today, yesterday, or 3 weeks from now. Seriously. They even acknowledge this massive glitch in their FAQ section. The second biggest nuisance is that the website does not interact with the app. Log a food online and expect it to sync with the app? Haha, good luck!"
3482,3482,3,2015-09-05T18:59:07.000Z,ToughBastahD,"Great app, some serious bugs","I signed up for the 1 year subscription, and it works fine, when I close the app, next time I open the app it says I'm a standard member and it offers me to sign up for gold again, then I hit yes, it says I'm already a member and shows me as gold, until the next time I open the app again, same thing. This is amateur and not very user friendly. This needs to be fixed, makes this app look like it's not ready for prime time yet."
3483,3483,4,2016-05-01T13:26:23.000Z,DrawRiot,Finally the perfect app!,"I have tried a lot of apps on the market to count calories, exercise and life. This is by far the best and it makes me happy just to interact with it! Great UX/UI and it has almost everything I need. The only thing that would make it better is a Vegan diet option. I have already tried some of the vegan recipe options and they are awesome I would love to get a whole diet for us vegans! Thanks for the awesome app!"
3484,3484,5,2017-03-10T20:35:01.000Z,Stepheeeezy,Love this app!,"This is, by far, my favorite health app!! I rave about it to my friends. It has changed the way I diet and I am seeing lots of results. I can't wait for what changes will be"

For years I have had a toxic relationship with food, and Lifesum helps me plan and see what I eat. It is so easy to use. You can just enter the brand or scan the barcode and all of the health related info is there. A must for me"
3486,3486,1,2017-04-19T02:42:52.000Z,Gexaethbca,Save your money and go with MyFitnessPal,"After a short test run, I decided to purchase a subscription (splurging $50) so that I could enter my own recipes (otherwise, you can only enter a maximum of 2). Lifesum doesn't have a website so all ingredients have to be entered on your phone-- it's a hassle, but I could deal with that. What I can't deal with, however, is the total lack of structure. Anyone can enter anything, and then you'll have to weed through it all when you search for foods. If you try to enter a zucchini, for example, you'll get 50 different entries."
3487,3487,5,2017-04-29T15:23:53.000Z,Sawyer925,"Seriously, this is an incredible app.","This app was worth every penny. I payed the full amount for it and I don't regret it at all. It has everything you could need: a meal plan, a layout of the nutrition facts, a scanner to scan your food products, and reminders. For anyone who has no clue how to eat healthy, this app is for you. It's basically ""eating healthy for dummies"". Love it!"
3488,3488,5,2017-08-19T19:09:50.000Z,Native_Mommie,Love this app!,This is the only app that has ever worked for me. I have never been someone that can use an app to help with my weight-loss goals but since I started using this app I've lost 47lbs! It is super easy to use and I love that I can track my exercise even when I do at home workouts like Jillian Michaels. I've recommended this to many other.
3489,3489,3,2017-09-05T00:06:06.000Z,jenjenjesus,Good but needs some work,"Good app, however, doesn't have a food database to search from, so you have to manually enter or scan a barcode.  Also crashes a lot.  There is also only a 3 main meal and 1 snack option, so those of us that he 5-6 meals a day have to log it under the same category.  Won't rotate to landscape when using on ipad either.  Wish they would allow for free trial period, i would have probably got my money back."
3490,3490,5,2009-01-27T21:32:36.000Z,Pocket monitor,Excellent Program,Have been using this program for only two weeks & have lost 10 pounds.  This is a great tool to help one become aware of what they are eating.  A graphic way to teach better eating & exercising habits.  There is a short learning curve but well worth the investment of time.  The tutorials are excellent as well as the prompt response to questions.  This is a great motivator!!!    THANKS

3492,3492,5,2017-01-02T00:54:34.000Z,Katiestevers,Love this app!,I have been upset about noon weight loss coach not being in the App Store. I've refused to keep trying apps because none of them were as great as it was! I decided to try one finally after seeing it on Facebook and I love it! It has everything I need to track foods and exercise! I love having all the healthy living articles too!
3493,3493,4,2017-01-08T08:08:03.000Z,AnshinCychro,Gonna be healthier!,"Love this app! It's making me more conscientious about my food intake and can't wait to gain my body back!!! Only thing that is lacking is the way the food listed isn't always what I'm eating. If there was a way to put the food I'm actually eating in a search bar that can research the internet so I can be more accurate, that would help more. Maybe offer it in the premium package?"
3494,3494,3,2017-03-14T17:27:21.000Z,ZeroStar.hX,Almost perfect,The only thing preventing me from giving this a 5 star is how annoying the app can get if you're not subscribed to premium.
3495,3495,5,2017-03-27T02:00:16.000Z,Paleo ballerina,Glitchy but great for macros,Love this app it makes it so easy to track my macros! It usually runs super well although lately it's been glitching on my IPhone 5s (maybe it is unable to keep up with older systems). I love the ability to scan foods in and also add water and exercise! All in all really love this app (and right now I only have the free version)
3496,3496,5,2017-03-27T23:34:35.000Z,Zoe_boo_99,Don't even need pro,"This app is so amazing! It counts calories lets me know how many carbs, how much fat, I should eat though out the day! You can Search up almost any food and it will tell you how many carbs it is and which category (fats, proteins, carbs, etc.) the food goes under. I love it and it's can be like a game! I love it and it keeps my diet in check."
3497,3497,4,2017-04-20T19:26:16.000Z,ericsisk,Mostly good. When it works.,"I really like this app, but very recently it has either arbitrarily stopped including data from my Apple Watch or iPhone, or went crazy with too much of the same thing (I.E. doubling my steps, etc.) This throws everything off. If it gets fixed, I'll change my rating. I would go with another app, but this has the best interface out there."
3498,3498,5,2017-07-11T19:03:32.000Z,h greed,App is dope!,Awesomeness! I love this app. I get reminders to drink water. Update my weight. A bar that lets me know when I'm staying on track or doing well based off what I currently ate. I can't complain. I like it. I will upgrade at some point. And I don't feel pressured to upgrade either. That's the best part. I can stay with the free portion and still monitor my weight if I like.
3499,3499,4,2017-07-27T23:37:08.000Z,KetoKali,Awesome but....,"Two really great things that my fitness pal has is the ability to copy and paste a website recipe into the app and add it to your daily logs. Also, it would be fantastic if I could create my own recipes from scratch on this app and have the nutritional info calculated for you. Please consider doing these two things bc right now I'm still using mfp to do these for me!! Otherwise it's a great app."
3500,3500,1,2013-12-26T03:02:37.000Z,Chabo519,Disappointed with the changes,"When Lifesum was ShapeUp Club, all my gadgets were synced. When I entered it into the iPad, it synced with the iPhone and my computer site. Now, it does not. I do not want to enter everything more than once, nor do I want to wait until I have access to the iPad or computer. My iPhone is the quickest way to keep track, but I like to review and keep notes on the iPad or computer.  If everything would sync again, it would be the perfect app it was before. As of right now, I will not be renewing my Gold Membership. It's no longer worth it."
3501,3501,4,2014-05-23T13:30:19.000Z,Crazy Jae,ALMOST five stars,"the calorie count in this app is perfect!! very realistic and effective. I was able to break through my plateau with the limit it had set up for me. my favorite thing about this app is you are allowed to lose more than 2lbs a week. that is heaven for me. the only bad thing about this app is the food inventory, and exersice inventory, that needs to expand and be updated. please. it's this apps only downfall!"
3502,3502,2,2015-11-16T02:47:11.000Z,rabbitshavefangs,Would be a good app but fails,This seemed to be a good app the first couple days I used it but then I accidentally added an exercise and could not remove it. When I tried it kept adding the same exercise again and again. Now my entire diary is all jacked up. Read directions for app and online and could find no guidance for this other than swiping left to delete which I tried and didn't work. Reset app and phone to no avail. Going to delete this and find something that works.
3503,3503,3,2016-01-12T18:04:22.000Z,Smwatson914,Needs work,"I love this app, especially for the water tracker but trying to put in food is sooooooooo frustrating. Most of the info for the food that I scan is wrong and it doesn't give you the option to fix it so I can't even put it in. & what's the point of using it if I can't track my food as accurate as possible. I hope this is fixed soon because I'd really like to keep using the app & was considering upgrading."
3504,3504,5,2016-04-29T20:39:41.000Z,Shannongardens,I like it!!!,I've used a few different apps to track my eating and this is the best one I've found. It's easy to work around. I enjoy the reminders and the diet categories. I've been using it for 2 weeks and I've been consistent with tracking every meal. I would recommend it!!
3505,3505,4,2016-07-15T00:12:28.000Z,2LG2Z,Excited so far,"I have been using the app for a few days now, and I am really enjoying it. I tracked before with weight watchers and myfitnesspal, but lately I'd given up on tracking because I just found it too demanding of my limited time. This app is fun to use, and the integration with my apple watch is great. I hesitate to add another monthly expense, but I am seriously considering upgrading to a paid membership."

I tried reset everything and no luck so far. I have a premium account and use an iPhone 7 with the latest iOS 10 update available."
3507,3507,5,2017-03-01T19:19:02.000Z,Squrillllle,Good,"The design is very cute and vibrant. Without a premium membership you can't do much, but is a very good food/water/exercise tracking diary. Based on lifestyle quiz, you are given meal suggestions (not recipes unless you're premium), and you can look up how to make it if you don't feel like spending $45 on a membership. Good app overall."

I love the look of the app as well, it is fun to look through, and the recipes are very easy. When I am not making my own food and out eating I have a hard time trying to find different foods or brands. That is the only reason for the 4 stars, otherwise a great app. Disclosure: I paid for the full features"

There is an ability to edit foods, but it's bulky. The portion sizes are very clumsy--in ounces, in many cases, for example, rather than teaspoons. I came from a Treo background, where I had used CalorieKing--which is MUCH better, but sadly not available for iPhone. I've tried a couple of other apps; this seems to be the best of the bunch."

The one thing I would love to see (unless I missed something) is a reminder notification setting for water . I've been trying to increase my water intake so I don't get dehydrated & having a little nudge would be good. 😊"

However, after a few days with it, I’m not convinced that the ratings are worth anything. My fried egg in the morning earned me an A, but the fresh blueberries were rated a D because of added sugar. I’m not sure the developer understands what added sugar means. This app also seems to have some issues with internationalization. My 42 mile bike ride on an American English system was listed with a comma as the decimal separator. I’ll be cancelling my gold membership."

This app, and service is a deep dive into thinking about food in a healthy way every time.  Yes, I am losing weight, but I also feel great!  I am more active and feel like I am winning.  Lifesum is a tool and if you use it, you can build healthy habits and change yourself."

Some how it just gets me motivated. They have different diet plans to suit your needs such as ""Low Carb"" and ""High Protein"" but right now I'm still on the standard diet."

3517,3517,4,2016-11-04T12:57:26.000Z,AtownDown,New update messes up exercise calories,The app update inaccurately tracks your activity data.  It drastically increases your steps.  They are pushing an update soon but in the mean time follow these steps that worked for me.  1. Turn off automatic tracking 2. Delete the app.  3. Re-install app 4 turn on automatic tracking.  It fixed my issue.  Other than that great free app and the yearly subscription is cheap.  I love it!

The UX/UI was the first thing that grabbed my attention, after that I found that it was highly functional as well. It syncs with Fitbit and apple health so all my data is consistent in every app."
3519,3519,3,2017-01-25T14:55:46.000Z,eastboundtraffic,Good but room for improvement,"I've really enjoyed my experience with lifesum thus far but there are definitely aspects of the app that could use improvement. Entering new foods to the database is clunky and confusing at best and frustrating at worst. The diet options are more limited with less information than I expected with the paid membership. Also, I wish there were more vegan recipes and encouragement as that is the diet I'm doing."
3520,3520,4,2011-06-24T03:08:53.000Z,Birdfanoftheangry,Overall great app,I really like this app makes it easy to add things quickly. The only thing I've had a hard time with is the calories for exercise. It seems inaccurate to me. I have verified the calories on other sites too and typically those sites are less calories than what it does here. Any update to this would be greatly appreciated since I like using this app so much.
3521,3521,5,2015-10-07T17:47:11.000Z,Bs812,Excellent for my limited use case,I am really benefitting from this app but I must say that I'm only using it to track food consumption and water consumption. It does that very well. I find many of the foods I eat already in the database and I have added a few custom recipes of things I often eat. It's really raising my awareness of my food intake.
3522,3522,4,2017-01-07T21:25:49.000Z,Ashigirl3040,Pretty good app,"Super fun and easy to use! I love how you can easily add foods you eat, and it tells you the nutritional info. The only thing I don't really like is that there is limited workout information. Whenever you try to add the exercises you've done, the only ones listed are machine workouts, and you have to add them manually. I would recommend using the 8fit app along with this one :)"
3523,3523,4,2017-03-08T19:03:27.000Z,Shepton2,Great when it doesn't freeze,The food tracker is great but the app freezes and crashes every so often. You need to delete it and then reinstall to get it working again.

I like that my fitness pal has a community on it this doesn't you have to request for your friends to join and I don't have friends who like to work out and watch what they eat. I didn't see a huge difference in the pro and the regular but this is a good app just not amazing. I would probably download it but not go pro."

However, it doesn't seem like there's any way to sync data to a second device (like my iPad) even if both devices are signed into the same account. Not really sure what the point of having a separate account that doesn't sync data is..."
3526,3526,5,2017-07-19T04:10:48.000Z,JoyfulPilgrim,Wow. Just wow,I have used the app for a couple of months now and like it more every day. I can see exactly how I am doing with carbs and other nutrients. I have tried several of the diet plans before I settled on low carb. I couldn't have done that without this app. Thank you so much Developers for the time and effort you put into this app.
3527,3527,4,2017-08-01T20:18:38.000Z,Piglover🥑,Amazing! But....,"I went on a 30 min walk and before it I activated the Step Tracker but it didn't track my steps. 🤔 I still love this app though, but I also wish I didn't have to pay monthly for premium... and not having much on the free version. Other than that I love this app! 👍"
3528,3528,5,2017-08-08T19:32:53.000Z,krismus,Love this app,"So far my fave nutrition app, and I've tried a lot. Beautiful, simple interface (no ads/clutter like the leading nutrition tracker). I've tried premium and enjoyed the benefits but am currently using the free version to save money. May upgrade again in the future when I'm back in weight loss mode (currently pregnant), as I think it's worth it."
3529,3529,5,2017-08-08T21:19:26.000Z,Nordodo,Life changer!,"This app can literally change your life and help you get in shape. I use it everyday! I don't care to buy a full version because I cant stand any subscription type purchases, but even the light version is a great help."
3530,3530,3,2008-10-22T20:13:54.000Z,withanx,Needs a better food database,"This app is exactly what I was looking for in all aspects but one.  When I'm on the go and stop somewhere to get food, I usually don't have time to ask for a nutrition sheet and enter the information.  I'd love to see an online nutrition lookup added with all the common restaraunts accounted for.  For now, I'm sticking with mynetdiary specifically for this feature, and would love to switch back if this feature is supported in the future."
3531,3531,2,2015-09-30T21:38:16.000Z,Alabama Jay,Had high hopes but terrible experience,I started out already kind of being skeptical about this app. But I read the reviews and downloaded it. Then I saw the potential it had so I upgraded to the Gold version. So I thought anyway. They charged me for the upgrade but never converted me over to Gold status. Contacted customer support by email and got the run around with computer generated messages. It has been a week now and still no refund or anything. I don't recommend this app to anyone
3532,3532,4,2016-06-03T03:11:34.000Z,Simsmaniax,Why is this still free!?!,"I love this little app! I've deleted all the other apps I had like 'lose it' because this one does it all. Keeps track of my water intake, workouts,food, what portions are carbs,fat, protein. Lets you know how much longer you have until you reach your goal weight. Gives you healthy food recipes depending on what diet you follow. And it's really easy to use!!! Try it!!!"
3533,3533,5,2016-12-31T01:57:54.000Z,Bandicoot23,Simplifies tracking of everything!!,"Awesome how simple it is to search for various foods and beverages for meals. Then it also pulls in my exercise from my watch and phone to give me my caloric intake to meet my goal of losing 15 lbs. Seamless, simple, and very useful if you have always found it annoying and troublesome to track what you eat."
3534,3534,5,2017-01-28T22:31:46.000Z,Mermikey,Obsessed,"Perfect for my obsessing over what I eat. Helps me keep my sweet tooth in check and I have yet to consume a food that isn't in their catalog, which was a problem I've had with other apps. They even have menu items from popular restaurants. Barcode scanner is also very handy. Will continue to use forever."
3535,3535,3,2017-02-16T06:00:44.000Z,ludoviclandry,"Great App, missing HealthKit integration","App looks great and good design which makes it easy to use. Unfortunately there is no HealthKit integrating which makes it pretty much useless. Pleeeeease add this! Every fitness and health app should have his by now, I have to use MyFitnessPal in the meantime but their UI is a total mess (Oh, and also fix the terribly old Facebook connect WebView you are using where you have to re-login, and just redirect me to the native FB app like everybody else does)."
3536,3536,5,2017-03-01T01:25:23.000Z,Casey Chicken🐔,THE REVIEW OF LIFESUM,I downloaded this app when I focused more on eating healthier. This app really helped me with that and it's very helpful for those trying to lose weight. Lifesum is great for tracking the foods you ate every day and gives you and honest daily rating and honestly tells you how healthier you have to eat. Lifesum really does help your LIFE. Hope you enjoy!
3537,3537,5,2017-04-12T13:37:55.000Z,5stars LOVE IT,Recipes,I wish you could add your own recipe or add one you found on Google.
3538,3538,5,2017-06-16T00:28:10.000Z,PRienzi,Great for someone like me,"I've never kept track of anything I ate, or the water that I drink until I started using lifesum. I've used this app for almost a month and I'm down 15 lbs. I did upgrade so that I can have access to everything. I highly recommend this app to anyone to wants to be healthier and/or lose weight!"
3539,3539,5,2017-09-08T21:25:59.000Z,JLG103091,Best food tracking app I've used so far,This is the best app I've tried so far - including Weight Watchers and My Fitness Pal.
3540,3540,3,2009-04-12T01:30:30.000Z,MoonSinger,Not Bad,"This is not a bad app but it does need a bit more functionality. Not everyone wants to lose weight at the rate of 2 pounds per week. That is the MOST the average person should attempt to lose (or you are actually losing muscle as well). There should at least be additional options to lose 1 pound and 1.5 pounds per week. Also you should be able to adjust the percentages of protein, fat and carbs if you are following, say, a lower carb diet."
3541,3541,3,2014-10-17T15:09:53.000Z,6ryph3n,Has potential to be the best,This could be the best food diary/tracker I’ve found if they didn’t push so hard for Gold upgrade. The interface is much better than MyFitnessPal but basic functionality that MyFitnessPal does for free costs $3/month or more in Lifesum. I understand paying for a subscription if I want an ongoing meal plan but why can’t I just pay a one time price for basic functionality like logging my own food?
3542,3542,5,2016-03-28T16:44:49.000Z,PC Purist,One of my favorite tracking apps!,"I really like it so far! It's a quick and easy way to track food and activities. I love that it tracks water intake too, that's such an important component to a healthy lifestyle that I think sometimes falls by the wayside. I'll likely stick with this app whenever I'm looking to manage my weight."
3543,3543,2,2016-05-09T04:23:34.000Z,ohthetrees,Latest release is worse,"This most recent version has made some changes for the worse. For example, searching for a food doesn't result in your favorites showing up first. You have to click on the favorites tab, and then search for your favorites to show up. Second, I can't figure out how to make a new recipe. I've been trying for the last two minutes. I did this just fine in the previous version, but can't figure it out now."
3544,3544,5,2016-08-19T15:56:36.000Z,maymes,Great for baby boomers,"As a 50-something woman, I really like this app.  It's easy to use.  That's so important for my generation.  In addition, I am learning a lot about better choices with the food rating system the app uses.  I don't feel like I have to stress when I enter my foods.  I just choose the closest option on the list. Good job guys!"
3545,3545,3,2017-03-03T12:32:10.000Z,Gingerbread113,Apple Watch vs phone app,"The apps are somewhat different and do not sync correctly. When I input water intake on my watch it does not sync on the app on my phone. Also, if I add an extra glass of water by accident I can't remove it. Minor things like this make the app very annoying to use."
3546,3546,5,2017-07-16T03:53:32.000Z,TrayC's itunes,Gets Use!,"I don't find many of these kinds of apps that keep my interest, but this one totally does. Totally easy to use. I adore how the water cups fill up with the lil' sound and everything~ I think there is plenty of use in the free bits so i get good use, so good that i'm planning on actually getting premium. Worth my while anyway :)"
3547,3547,2,2017-08-17T00:58:49.000Z,Hoola h00p,It started so well,I really loved the aesthetics and graphics and I liked that you could choose a goal instead of just weight loss. Things got rough when I saw how few foods were pre-logged and ready to add. They got rougher when I began to add recipes and found out that on the free version you can only add two of your own recipes. As a grad student I cook a lot of my own meals and paying for the premium version is not a bill I need right now when there are other free apps on the market.
3548,3548,4,2017-08-19T20:03:17.000Z,JRE987,Easy to use fitness/nutrition app,Very user friendly interface and layout. This app introduced me to consistently tracking calories and I've had good results from always knowing where I stand in terms of caloric intake during the day. One drawback is the app is a little glitchy at times but this really hasn't had a big impact on my daily use. I recommend.
3549,3549,5,2017-08-31T18:26:22.000Z,Sncox,Love it!,"I started using the app on a Monday and tracking my food, choosing my plan, and being super honest."
3550,3550,2,2009-04-21T16:25:13.000Z,Archeron,Taking away features,"They recommended an update with ""important issues"" and all they did was take away the option to track points. That is fine, but at least *tell* people you are nerfing the program. Without that feature it is of little value to me. If you just want to track overall calories, this will still work for you, but beware the next update, when they do more things to the program WITHOUT telling you!"
3551,3551,5,2012-01-09T03:36:13.000Z,Spabody,Great help,Shape Up is a great tool to keep me motivated and informed.  I've not yet to stump the search feature.  I eat a lot of sushi and it has it all.   If I want treat myself with something extra I can quickly figure out how much extra time I need to spend in the gym to cover it.  I have recommended to all of my friends and family.
3552,3552,5,2016-02-09T17:50:24.000Z,AmandaNOtero,Best fitness app I've used,"Lifesum is honestly the best app in comparison to other fitness apps. It's organized, clean, super easy to use, and most importantly, it's extremely helpful. It recommends meals according to your health goals and provides calorie counts so you can keep track of the food you eat. There's a lot more to it, but so far I am very happy with Lifesum."
3553,3553,4,2016-02-26T00:19:07.000Z,Lymanzaar,"Excellent way to count calories, protein, fat","Trying to gain weight, and now I can evaluate what I eat and how to balance my diet. You can use the barcode feature to scan items, and some fast food items can be searched for. However, its hard to add homemade dishes with multiple ingrediants, or add items from University dining. I wish they could add a custom food feature"
3554,3554,3,2016-04-06T17:29:53.000Z,Blacksunn-Aggramar,Much more potential.,"I love using this app already, but I fear down the road it's not going to work for me the more serious I get. One major thing: it doesn't sync ANY information with the health app for iOS, which I and several others use frequently. Macros and a feedback ability to even just submit new food, brands, et cetera would be huge. I love it now, but later on it won't work out unless it gets upgraded."
3555,3555,5,2016-10-29T05:54:26.000Z,graceee_isabellaaa,Lifesum,"OMG! Lifesum has helped me soooo much with keeping track of how many calories I put into my body each and everyday!😱🙊🌸💕 Who ever created this app has to be a genius! 5/5 stars⭐️ I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this app for someone who wants to take control of their eating and not starve themselves. Back at it AGAIN, with full force, anonymous😒"
3556,3556,4,2016-11-06T17:19:52.000Z,WhoKnowsY,Bugs Fixed! App works great again!,So great to have this app back! The Nov 6 update seems to have addressed all the bugs with exercise tracking and Watch syncing that occurred with the Oct 31 update.
3557,3557,5,2016-11-28T20:20:14.000Z,Lighter&Happier,This app is great!,"This app helped me figure out just how many calories I need to consume to lose weight by a certain time. I've lost 10 pounds already in a much shorter time than if I had just been trying to alone. Additionally, I like the feedback it gives on the quality of food that I am eating."
3558,3558,1,2017-01-09T01:46:49.000Z,jonesingsimba,Garbage,"So far this app does not work well at all. After just one day I realize that the accompanying watch app is completely broken and does not work at all and even though I set up Lifesum to write data to the health app, it's missing a bunch of the data like water intake which seems pretty important. Something as simple as water intake in which I straight up tell the app I drank one glass of water and it can put even get that right. In an effort to some eating some much garbage food I have come to realize that this app is itself, garbage."
3559,3559,5,2017-02-09T03:10:29.000Z,Night Mer,Great app can use some updating,I love this app! It is great to track calories and I love that it teaches you what to improve on eating. The calories for some things are really off. Someone needs to delete and filter through most of the food so just be careful when logging. Other than that it's a great modern calorie tracker!
3560,3560,5,2009-02-11T18:45:42.000Z,Mark1977,One of my most favourite apps,"I got this app originally to help me with my daily diet to help reach my goal.  Been using it everyday for the past few months.  Found a few bugs, and reported them.  Response in emails were great."
3561,3561,1,2011-01-24T16:04:52.000Z,Bigmedmac,Ruined,"The system is junk since the update in December. It won't sync with mobile devices 50% of the time. Get a message about 20% on the web that system is being updated. Already looking at other systems.  It is so frustrating because you get an email back from ""martin"" 1 or 2 days after being submitted.  By then the problem might be resolved or you have lost two days on the system tracing calories & exercise.  Would not recommend due to the sporadic nature of service and very generic customer service."
3562,3562,5,2011-09-19T22:18:42.000Z,Mummy2twomunchkins,Great Weight Loss Tool!,This is an excellent tool for losing weight by tracking calories.  I have been using it for 5 weeks and have lost 10 pounds and it's free!  Don't really need the gold.  Only negative is that the exercise calories are WAY off.  They are much too high so I have created my own exercises with mote realistic calories burned.
3563,3563,5,2013-02-04T14:50:54.000Z,AoHines7,Great way to hold yourself accountable!,I have really been able to keep up with what I'm eating & it helps me make better choices. I love being able to scan  barcodes too. Before this I would try to mentally keep track of what I was eating & that was ineffective. Definitely recommend this app!
3564,3564,4,2015-09-09T21:16:13.000Z,Woodenfreakbot,Great app but I have one suggestion,"I really like the app because it helps me focus on how much and what I need to eat to live healthy. I just wish that the Apple Watch version would support voice integration. For example, it would be great to just tell the app on the watch what I just ate, instead of just giving me the option between small, medium, and large meal input."
3565,3565,4,2015-09-27T12:54:44.000Z,Jewel Daab,Switched from MFP,I've used My fitness Pal for three years now and have managed to lose 70 lbs and manage it. I recently discovered Lifesum when browsing apps and decided to check it out. I like the interface and design over MFP and it seems like this app is on the right track. Looking forward to updates and improvements in the coming months.
3566,3566,4,2016-01-19T14:54:51.000Z,Valerie__Hogan,Still needs work,"Love the design, UI is alright. Adding food via scanning is nearly always incorrect and won't let me edit it if it's ""already in the system"". Doesn't  sync correctly to my Fitbit and I can't see my calories burned until the day ends. Customer service has been no help. Also, I wish there was a way to track cups of coffee / caffeine intake."
3567,3567,5,2017-02-13T00:14:31.000Z,Ardenchild22,Love!,What a great app! I love that it helps me see not only how many calories I've had but also the nutrients and if I'm on track or not with my healthy choices. I did opt to not have my exercise count in with my calories for the day because it was saying I needed to eat more due to my workout. Easy fix. I love it!
3568,3568,3,2017-06-26T12:20:02.000Z,Mllekathy,All About Premium,"I get that they need to make money, but this app doesn't make it possible to accurately track your health without paying. Shouldn't it still help, regardless? I could get a similar app (fitness pal) and get some of the features that this app locks up. The only reason why I stick with it is because of the little smileys and the overall appearance is a good change from the other app."
3569,3569,4,2017-08-31T20:29:35.000Z,AMTom13,"So far, so good...","I like the app and ended ip paying for premium so I could personalize it to my needs. It's been a week and I feel better, healthier. However it bothers me when I end with the right amount of Carbs and it says ""over"" at 0 remaining. I would like this updated because I look for the overs and when I'm on point, it's frustrating to see ""over."""
3570,3570,5,2009-01-01T18:27:06.000Z,PBRaven,This Program Is Amazing!,"I can't tell you how much I love this program!  I went to your website first, and watched all the instructional videos before I began using the program.  It keeps so much information - and is so easy to use.  It couldn't be more perfect for my needs.  Thank You Thank You!!"
3571,3571,4,2010-08-13T12:58:33.000Z,remymartin22,Love This!!!!,"I use this app every day!  The functionality is great and it really helps me hold myself accountable. Also love that it keeps track of calories burned. Just wish that my calories burned with exercise weren't added back into my ""left to eat"" calories since I am working on losing weight, not maintaining it.  Other than that, I love it and all of the features!"
3572,3572,1,2011-01-06T14:04:48.000Z,zerocharismo,Forced gold account signup is obnoxious,"The new version will not let you into the app without signing up for a free trial of their ""gold"" account... I do not want a free trial of something that will be paid later on, so the app gave me no choice but to go through the trouble of throwing it out and reinstalling the previous version. Now of course all of my data is gone. I paid for the app a long time ago when I bought it, making me pay more in order to continue to use it is just obnoxious. Zero stars would be better."
3573,3573,5,2011-05-23T13:29:01.000Z,Sharron Mathews,Great App!,Very helpful with weight and calorie management. My whole family uses the app to keep calorie intake and portion size control in the right limits. I've used this app since March 2010 and not experienced many glitches at all. No glitches in the past many months. There have been many updates.
3574,3574,5,2016-06-09T03:43:05.000Z,HappyDieter,Helpful and user friendly,This app makes it so easy to track calories and input exercise. It has so many food choices and portion sizes. Being able to favorite foods also makes inputting meals much quicker. Would highly recommend over other calorie counting apps
3575,3575,5,2016-07-18T04:17:24.000Z,Chffmllc,I have never left a review for something in my life,But seriously this app is amazing. They have thought of everything! I love it! I'm a whole new woman! I've never counted calories in my life. I had no clue how much I was putting in my body! Thank you the free version! Although I will probably upgrade as my addiction continues! :)
3576,3576,5,2016-08-11T13:10:00.000Z,The_shinndig,Great App! Meeting my calorie goals!,This app is great. Very modern looking and you can find just about every food item you will eat! The barcode scanner is super clutch too. I love that is tracks my water intake and exercise as well. I've been able to meet my calorie goals by tracking and I couldn't be happier with LifeSum!
3577,3577,3,2017-01-20T20:43:13.000Z,tofyneforu,Nutritional information needs to be updated,I like using the app and I think that it is great that they help you choose a meal plan that fits your life but when entering info for lettuce the nutritional info is hilarious there is no way romaine lettuce has so much sugar in it. I like the tracking and accountability but accurate this app is not. I will continue to use the app mainly because I paid for the year after that I am not sure.
3578,3578,2,2017-01-22T21:48:48.000Z,Ahamel21,Not all aspects of the app work,"I pay for premium and I expect it to work, I tried taking the life score test and I'm at 97% complete and it won't load I've tried multiple times I've tried closing the app and restarting it I've even tried shuting my phone down and it still doesn't work, also I invited a friend who downloaded the app and it won't let us be friends through the Lifesum app. for a customer paying $50 for this app it really should work"
3579,3579,5,2017-01-30T14:38:46.000Z,XXXDWXXX,Love interacting with this app!,I really enjoy entering my food and activity into this app. I've tried to be consistent with it before but this is the first time I've continued to do it more than a few days. I've been consistent for about 2.5 months now and it makes a huge difference in my training.
3580,3580,1,2013-11-23T01:56:29.000Z,lisag_nz,"Ugh, don't update to the new version",I loved this app but the update has just wrecked it.

However recently this has been killing my battery! I would open the app it would ""froze"" my battery is at %67 i wait couple minute and force quit the app and my battery is below %50 please fix this. Also I think it started when I hooked it up to my Jawbone Up"
3582,3582,5,2015-06-26T19:30:27.000Z,Lbates82,This app is a huge help,I really like this app. It helps me stay accountable and keeps track of my food for me. Make it so easy.  Especially when I can just can a barcode on food package and all the info is right there without me having to type it all in. I highly recommend Lifesum.
3583,3583,4,2015-11-10T16:01:55.000Z,Ams5213,Easy to use,I think that this program is very easy to use and I love how it tracks the water that you drink and reminds you actually drink because sometimes I forget whenever I'm busy. I like the recommended recipes that they have I wish that they would use a larger variety and maybe even show community and start a blog section.
3584,3584,4,2016-04-18T10:36:25.000Z,Britters❤️🌷,Not what I thought but love it,I absolutely love the app!! It's wonderful for keeping me on track with calories and nutrient distribution for every meal!!
3585,3585,3,2016-07-15T21:53:16.000Z,Tiny-dancer-27,Meal grades are off,"I like a lot of things about the app, but the way it ""grades"" your meals and your day seems inaccurate. It's based on a balance between carbs, protein, and fat, which seems like a good idea. However, it doesn't work in practice. I put my lunch in today - a salad and some steamed vegetables and it gave me a D because it said both were heavy in carbs. So, I add in the two chocolate cookies I had, and it jumps up to a C! How does that make any sense?"
3586,3586,5,2017-06-07T18:45:42.000Z,VeatVeat,Best app I've ever used for tracking,This app is awesome!! You choose what your overall goal is and it gives you a daily caloric intake goal and provides you with your macros needed for the day! If you get premium which cost as much as a fancy coffee at Starbucks every month it's definitely worth it!!
3587,3587,3,2017-07-05T14:15:37.000Z,psach2003,Needs Landscape Mode,"Lovely app! Switched from LoseIt to Lifesum and even started moving my recipes over - however, I realized on my iPad I can enter everything into LoseIt in Landscape with my keyboard and LifeSum does not have this feature. Unfortunately, it is not easy for everyone to type easily into phones. 😔 I would strongly suggest adding this feature to the app to make it easier for more folks to use it."
3588,3588,1,2017-07-21T00:04:33.000Z,NicknamePlz,Significant Bug,"I like this app. I've only been using it for a day and I really enjoy the free features and have been considering premium. HOWEVER, after merely a day of use I can no longer use the app. When I open it, it is very slow and unresponsive. It stays frozen until I close the app or until the app crashes on it's own. Nothing on my phone has changed between these past two days."

I have the paid version, am using it to follow a ketogenic light diet, and it's been an essential part of my success so far. My favorite part is tracking macro goals throughout the day."

3591,3591,3,2015-03-12T17:35:48.000Z,Princessgamble,Has Potential,"The app is easy to use has great tips and tools but the nutritional information is not accurate even on branded items. When I attempt to add an item via scanner it tells me the item already exists, asks if I want to go to the item but when I click yes the app crashes. When I go back in and look for the item I find it but nutritional information doesn't match."

It is fast, simple, and intuitive. The most notable feature is its all-new water tracker, which sends you reminders and encourages you to stay hydrated with your diet. It also has an Apple Watch app that brings quick productivity on the go."

This app is helpful for seeing what your eating down to carbs, protein, and fats. It's quick and easy to in put my meals. I can put in snacks and exercise. It balances my calories and gives me info on how to do better. I use this app all day and everyday. Love it!"

My only complaint is I can not get the Apple Watch glance to update. Even after opening the app on my watch. The app updates but the glance still shows no data. When this is fixed it will be my go to health app.

UI is beautiful & intuitive, but what's keeping me from rating this five stars (and from buying a subscription) is the inability to create a recipe and apply it to your diary like in mfp. Until this happens, I'll just have to use Lifesum and mfp on different days, depending if I'm cooking a dish for multiple people or just myself"
3596,3596,2,2016-09-17T04:04:27.000Z,Evynstar,"Looks nice, but free version is worthless",Recipes are locked if you are not a paid premium user. Additional meal planning suggestions are locked unless you pay for it. All you really can do is log your own food and personal recipes - I already know what I eat and that its not working for me. I could have written my meal planning on paper faster than using this app.

So, I don't have to calculate the macros myself. Lastly the recipes are great! I can search by an ingredient too. For example, if I want to cook something with cottage cheese, it will pull up recipes I can make! My new favorite app!"

I am required to eat a minimum of 500 calories more than the normal amount in order to account for the calories burned while breastfeeding and yet it shames me ( so to speech) for doing exactly that."

There are 4 different graphs to track your progress and an online list of foods to compliment those that are standard in the database.  You can also add and share foods and track water intake.  I love it!
3601,3601,3,2015-05-20T17:44:36.000Z,Xowawaox,Pretty perfect,"This app is great for tracking your meals and reminding you when to drink water. It helps me be more aware of the calories and fat I'm taking in as well as how much water I should be consuming. However, it is inconvenient that there are set meals installed in the app, even if the meal you had doesn't match any of theirs. That is the only problem I have found. Other than that, great app! I use it every day."

I needed an app for some guidance on diet and this seems helpful. Update: man honestly it's great, the only problem I ever have with this app is m forgetting to fill it in. Needs a reminder notification but"

I'm looking to lose fat and gain muscle and since this let's you track your macros it helps me understand how well or poor I'm eating. I did have to upgrade to premium though to get all the bells and whistles that I wanted, but it was worth it."

I used this one while I was pregnant to set goals to gain weight, ensure I was eating the calories and nutrition my baby needed, and now an using it to track weightloss. I've only used the free version, but have used it for about 2yrs. I highly reccomend this one!"
3611,3611,3,2015-12-05T21:55:15.000Z,Hahdjfuuuejdb,Guilt trip update,I would've given this app five stars until they did the update. Before the update I felt like I was doing a good job and it kept me motivated even if I went over my calories for the day. But after the update it has this weird rating system that makes it almost impossible to eat a perfect meal. It doesn't even average correctly. Please change it back!
3612,3612,5,2016-03-08T00:59:40.000Z,TylerAllBee,Great app!!!,"Even using the free version, this is the best way I've found of counting calories and water intake. As someone trying to gain weight, it's great to see visually if I need to eat more. I also love that it connects to my iPhone's built in health so it counts my steps for exercise. Def recommend this to everyone trying to diet."
3613,3613,3,2016-06-26T01:46:34.000Z,I love Sky Burger...1 problem,Meh,"First of all, when I entered my weight, it wouldn't accept pounds. I deleted the app, restarted the phone, then downloaded it again. It still would work. It did accept kilograms, so I guess it's ok. Second, I didn't find it that helpful. I don't really need to track every single bit that goes into my mouth, that's just sad. Although the interface was very simple and easy to understand."
3614,3614,4,2016-09-07T14:02:27.000Z,deirdre_lyon,A couple suggestions,Beautiful and helpful! I love the ratings - they really motivate me and educate me about what a well-rounded day looks like.

3617,3617,3,2017-06-08T01:17:42.000Z,TheGirlOnFire_0413,Eh it's ok I guess,"The app tracks your meals, calorie count, calories burned, water intake and exercise, and gives a daily score of what you ate. The app always said I wasn't eating enough, and I knew I was. It also gives invalid health scores, saying Doritos and pizza are healthier than grilled chicken and organic corn flakes w/ no added sugar. Besides that it's an ok app if you really want to track your weight, but idk what I really expected from it since I'm in shape."

I will give the rest of the percentage if end up working as it states. Now one down size I can said is recipes they are only give daily u cannot reader has more ahead. Then how I suppose to prepare meals ahead if I work. I will stay in touch and keep potential prospect posted of any updates in this app.

The typeface and colour choices make this app feel fresh and new, which is exactly what a health app should have. I can't comment on its effectiveness yet, but whether it be a placebo effect or something else, I already feel a lifestyle change falling into place."

I use it to track my food intake, and sync it with my Misfit, Workout app on iwatch, and Health app. They all work together to give me a full fitness picture. Lifesum makes you accountable for your food intake, but it doesn't take much time to drop a few pounds. Highly recommend."

The one suggestion I have though is to add a section for DRINKS. I typically list it under snacks, but then my calories for snacks will go over. Sometimes I have OJ or some juice in the middle of the day. So a DRINKS section would be really helpful."
3628,3628,2,2017-04-30T19:10:43.000Z,Lady Pepperell,Paid version not worth it,"I am trying out the paid version for 30 days. The free version is ok-though not much better than many other apps. The dietary plans are very limited. No way to select dietary limitations like vegetarian/gluten free, etc. also I don't necessarily eat three meals plus snacks but the calories are strictly distributed in these categories. Recipes are limited and not very interesting. No way to customize anything. Not worth the money."

I do wish it would export more data than just water to Apple Health. The user interface is nice and it is good at planning for your dietary future.

I mean, really? I'm willing to add an item to the app repository and make the product easier for the next person and I get penalized? Which genius came up with that?"

I wish they would partner with myfitnesspal or something to update the food database, though -- so many things are missing and the search function isn't smart enough. Worth the Gold membership though!!"
3633,3633,4,2016-08-30T00:32:39.000Z,Kflyy,Just a little improvement,"I wish you can specify what your nutrition goals are. Sometimes it will give us food a bad rating because it's calorie dense, but what if your goal was to primarily eat things that were calorie dense, and therefore get more caloric bang for your buck? It would also be nice if you could specify your own goals per meal."

What happen? As the old saying goes don't try to fix what is not broken. The last several updates have caused many changes and complications. Can you guys please fix it so that the app works properly.
3636,3636,4,2017-01-09T22:55:18.000Z,Seantoney,Overall Great App,"I would give this App a 5 start rating if it gave you specific meal plans. I am so busy constantly, it's hard to make meal plans and I thought with the Premium, we would get even a basic plan. I understand it's a lot to put in so that's why I still think this is a Great App! I have been recommending this o everyone."

I loved how the the app was set up, it's all organized and very easy to find everything. The one thing I had a problem with was that I'm allergic to fish and they kept suggesting salmon. I don't know how to do that.  But other than that the app was superb."

I would like to see more metrics for instance I don't always see when I'm measuring a cup, tablespoon, teaspoon. Also I did pay for this app because I loved the idea of it synching to my Fitbit. It does not do so accurately. For instance I worked out for an hour tonight burned 458 calories according to my Fitbit, I did synch it to Lifesum on Lifesum it says I only burned 229. I am NOT happy I paid for this app. Since the metrics and synching with Fitbit is not accurate."

I agree with others about the reliability of some of the numbers. I do appreciate the healthy recommendations in the upgrade. The earlier version recommended an unhealthy daily calorie goal. Thanks for the great product!

I like seeing the progress at a glance and it keeps me on track. My only recommendation is after a typed food search entry a window should come up to ask if you want to make it a Favorite.

The barscanner doesn't seem to work and creating a new food item that doesn't yet exist on the app is very difficult and most of the time won't even work. If you could fix this up it would make the experience a lot better."

I would like it if the graph for tracking your weight had all the way down to your goal weight on the y-axis instead of just your current weight. It would be nice to have that visual. Also, on the keto diet it counts dreary fiber for carbs, which you don't do on the keto diet."

This visual for each food item is great, and definitely does assist in me getting to know what foods are best for the particular diet I choose (I.e. Ketogenic extreme). I also like that it allows you to track your water intake."

I love this app, but it also doesn't subtract fiber from carbs giving you an inaccurate carb count.  At least make this an option for people!  It's great for deciding which foods to eat but right now the current version won't even allow you to do that.  Fix these issues and this app gets 4 or 5 stars!"
3647,3647,5,2017-06-20T00:23:04.000Z,nati5241,Great nutritional info!,This app is really teaching me to eat smaller portions and healthier food. I've been using it for about a month now and have already started losing  excess fat without working out! My only suggestions are to add a shortcut to add water intake and a widget for the lock screen.
3648,3648,2,2017-08-16T02:08:22.000Z,lizziemerk,2 for freezing 4 for features and usability,I like how this app looks and the features it offers but I have problems with it working and running properly every other day or so. To fix it I have to uninstall and then reinstall it. I have been using it for one week and have had to do this three times now. I would most likely pay for the premium platform if these problems were fixed.

All of my favorites are gone, all of the foods I created are gone, I can no longer copy from a previous day, which was so helpful.  This version is difficult to use.  I tried it for a few days and its not growing on me.  So I'm going to use another app I found.  Go with something else and stay away from this!  Some things don't need fixing or upgrades."

Add exercises and ability to edit calories burned from places like Orange Theory Fitness.

It shows up in my apple subscription and everything. I had someone helping me. He said to try the password he gave me. When I said it didn't work, I have no response. So I've emailed again to him and to the company with no results. I want either a refund or some support. $40 for an app is expensive, especially if it won't let me log in and use the features!"

And I am not sure how big a serving of vegetables counts as one broccoli icon. However I did get a good idea what I was doing wrong food wise. First time I found out I was shocked. Overall I am happy with it."
3658,3658,5,2017-03-29T13:54:23.000Z,sydddd:],Love it,"I really like this app. It allows me to track calories and macros to make sure I'm keeping myself on track and meeting all of my goals every day. If you pay extra I think it's like $3 per month, they offer a bunch of healthy recipes to try. It's a really great app!"
3659,3659,5,2017-05-30T19:35:47.000Z,Apple App Store Customer,Very Content,I downloaded this app and had issues with crashing. Upon sending a review and mentioning my issues the developer promptly answered. The app is functioning well at the moment and I would definitely recommend it to other. Wonderful app.
3660,3660,5,2012-04-27T00:15:45.000Z,Marksmanwolf,Love this App,"Works great! Easy to use, the online search for food is quite useful, may be time consuming in the beginning but once you start adding foods to your database or tag them as your favorite it moves along quickly, I've lost 10 lbs, only 5 more to go!"

The free part is good enough for me because of my background with nutrition science, but I'm sure the pay portion is good for those who have a hard time figuring out what is tasty and still meets their goals. Love it!"
3662,3662,4,2015-09-24T12:49:14.000Z,Dikico,Great amazing app! My favorite,"I love this app, it has helped me to track my nutrition and lose 20 pounds! The only thing is hat it keep changing my birthday? Also when I put in any food occasionally it tracks the calories as 0, or just a far less number than it actually is. So I have to delete it and add another one. Please fix!"

This site has helped me realize how little protein I eat. I've been using the free version for about a month and I'm going to upgrade."
3664,3664,5,2016-06-15T04:46:06.000Z,Cmdove83,Great app,"Easy to use and the most accurate. I have combined this app with my fitbit and I am proud of the results I have achieved thus far..( Weight loss, portion control, meal plan)."
3665,3665,2,2016-09-21T02:28:51.000Z,Musicians Guild,Works and doesnt work,I was immediately pretty impressed with what it could do but it needs improvement - like the foods you choose. There are duplicates in the lust but some it marks as healthy and others not. You can't see why without the premium.
3666,3666,5,2016-10-20T15:19:44.000Z,He.za,Helped so much,Helped me loose the weight in a healthy way. Super easy to use as well! I believe counting your macronutrients is the way to loose weight not through a diet and this app helps with that. I highly recommend this app even if you don't buy the full version.
3667,3667,4,2017-03-04T17:43:46.000Z,Wyokelly,Really good!!,"I was starting to eat healthier and workout more with other apps. Those apps let me document what I did, that's it. This app tells you what to eat and how to workout. When you document what you did it gives you a face with your day, and emotion, telling you what you did wrong and right. I love that aspect of this app."
3668,3668,5,2017-05-09T00:24:32.000Z,Pup*79,Highly Recommend!,"In past calorie watchers, I never entered in my food. I put it off. I love Lifesum though. It's like they are there and actually care! They gently push you to enter your meals. And this is the only app that I've never missed a daily entry! 10/10 recommended! Best one there is!"
3669,3669,5,2017-08-04T12:31:53.000Z,jpdc8,Great App!!,I absolutely loooove this app to track my macros. I've been doing it for a month and it has helped so much with staying on track. I also have an Apple Watch so it helps showing the calories I've burned as well. Absolutely love it and highly recommend it!!

It's really easy to add food and exercise and most food is already included in the database. To ""imoeris"" I'm using this app to track in Metric System, it works perfect. You can switch between imperial and metric in settings. :) Thanks for this app!"

3672,3672,1,2016-01-15T07:29:46.000Z,raftergirl,Tricky,I wanted to try the gold membership for one month to see how much I used it. I was thinking if I liked it I would continue the membership. Something went wrong in purchasing and I ended up with the year membership. I have emailed them to help me correct the error and have yet to hear back. It's an alright tracker program. Nothing more special than others I've used. Although I do like how it incorporates with my Fitbit. I just feel a little like they tricked me into more than I wanted.
3673,3673,3,2016-05-07T20:31:53.000Z,kaylieciri,Great but..,"I loved mostly everything about the app, but the grading is a bit strange. I would have 4 A grade foods in a meal and 1 grade C and get an overall of D, or I would have a day filled of grade A and B foods and get a day's grade of C or D. I know that I shouldn't look at that and be discouraged, but it's a bit difficult to think you've had a great day and have something with a few grams of sugar and be given a poor response!"
3674,3674,4,2016-05-20T14:28:02.000Z,5 star to my butt,Love this app!,"I love how quick and easy it is to log food and exercise with this app. Overall, it is a great way to track your progress. The only complaint i have is that it suggests I have 154 g of protein, which is triple the amount that is recommended for by myplate or any other normal diet. i don't like getting rated ""E"" on my meal because im not a body builder!!"
3675,3675,5,2017-04-18T17:39:25.000Z,StephS24,Easy and fast to use!,"Every food that I've scanned with their barcode has registered, so that's definitely a nice feature! Everything is quick, easy and accessible! It's super easy to add workouts and different exercises. I'm really loving this app!"
3676,3676,5,2017-05-28T17:24:37.000Z,JaredHamy6969,Great,"Overall just a great app for tracking calories to help you lose weight. The free version is adequate for what I needed, but for someone who wants to track more extensive things (like fiber and such), you might feel the need to upgrade. A good app and it serves its purpose."
3677,3677,5,2017-06-26T09:33:14.000Z,butterflies101,Love ... but,I love using this app.

I was able to make sure I wasn't starving myself by trying to eat less, even better made me eat more but with healthier meals. Thank you Lifesum."
3679,3679,3,2017-09-05T02:32:51.000Z,PolkabotBB,"Okay, but a big problem","I like that you can do a lot with it without having to pay for a premium version of the app, but it's not funny when you go to track calories and the app opens and crashes within 15 seconds. It was working fine the first day I had the app, but now it's the second day and it will not stop crashing."
3680,3680,1,2009-04-04T05:35:53.000Z,Emmy Winner,"Without Weight Watchers Points, it's a WASTE!","For 6 weeks, this program was my life as I started the new year off on weight watchers. I spent hours tweaking my options, developing meal plans and putting in my points. The results were amazing! Then the software update came along and took away points! Without the points option or the equivalent of it, this program is absolutely useless! Find a way to bring it back or sign a deal with Weight Watchers to license legally. You will make a fortune! The demand is HIGH!"
3681,3681,5,2011-08-22T00:44:42.000Z,Air1fan!,Perfect!,"Does exactly what it's meant for. Tons of food choices and it's very organized. I only wished they don't limit so much stuff to those who'd pay, but I completely understand why such a good app would make you pay some money for more features."
3682,3682,5,2013-06-16T17:07:38.000Z,Tony B.,One Happy user,Been using it for two year snow and am very happy with it. Lost almost 60 pounds so far. Have another 20 to go. I've gone off it twice so far and as soon as I stop counting calories I start to gain slowly. The secret is to keep portioning the food and counting the calories. Thanks ShapeUp.
3683,3683,5,2015-09-20T19:18:08.000Z,shortone2010,Great App,"I love this app. It makes tracking so easy, and I love how encouraging it is, even if you go over your calories by a bit. I also love that it gives you an idea of how many calories should be in each meal. Wish I would've found this app sooner"
3684,3684,5,2016-01-12T03:09:36.000Z,Keriann2011,Keeps me motivated,This app has changed my entire diet/exercise routine! I am on the ketogenic diet and working out 6 days a week and I only have the motivation to stick with it because of Lifesum! The diet is super challenging but helps me hold myself accountable. I recommend Lifesum to everyone that I know!!
3685,3685,4,2016-04-17T02:41:26.000Z,taken by the ice,"Good, but...","I bought this app initially to watch calories. The app is actually very good, and I defiantly recommend it. When I decided to buy gold, the premium version though, they had a 50% off sale on 6 months. It wasn't true, and I spent 3 hours with apple support that night. In summary, it's a good app, just beware of its sales."
3686,3686,5,2017-03-10T18:08:14.000Z,amylynnehayes,Best health app I've tried!,"Discovered Lifesum after trying lots of other fitness tracking apps, and enjoy it more than any of the others by far. Easy to use, love the interface, and love how it syncs with other apps like Apple Health and Runkeeper. Use it every day!"

When I first got the app, they would give me my daily rating ( happy face, okay face, bad face) but now they took that away and only Premium members get that and it's kinda annoying."

The design is pleasing to the eye, making it fun to log in food or water or exercises. This is the main reason I love this app, among many others. Highly recommend!! Thanks Lifesum!!"
3689,3689,3,2017-08-14T06:03:32.000Z,Dedeatburton,Great at first,I loved this app soooo much when I first got it. It's helpful and really easy. Until about 2 days ago when I started the free trial of premium. It just completely stopped tracking my steps and calorie burning. I thought it was something wrong with my phone but it did the same thing to my mom on her phone! This app is so great but incredibly frustrating.
3690,3690,5,2016-01-06T01:57:19.000Z,Ekneads,Great App,"I was a little skeptical, but after trying the free app I upgraded to Gold. Love that I can pick the ketogenic diet with choices of how many carbs a day. I don't have to count calories and that it grades my food choices to make picking something better for myself easier."
3691,3691,4,2016-01-19T17:10:29.000Z,Coteurres,It's ok,"I like this app. I have the gold version and it really helps me to know if I'm doing it right. But, I agree with previous comments that there's no enough space for healthy snacks, when actually you have to eat every 3 hours."
3692,3692,5,2016-06-03T01:20:34.000Z,Ms. McG,I like it!,"Today is my first day using LifeSum and I was surprised at how bad my eating habits are. I got quite a few 'C' grades for my meals and I was actually trying to follow a low carb diet. It's interesting how little we know about food and diet. Anyways, I look forward to using this app and so far I am hooked."
3693,3693,3,2016-07-29T02:07:27.000Z,Missyjay11,Takes forever to connect my Fitbit,It will only update my Fitbit info (calories burned) twice a day. Once in the morning time and once at night. It makes it EXTREMELY difficult to plan meals since I don't know how many calories I have burned until I'm already done eating for the day! Someone please fix this so it updates more periodically throughout the day!
3694,3694,4,2017-02-06T23:20:49.000Z,desiree.simmons84,Love Lifesum,This app is great! I love all of the posts give feedback as I add foods and activities throughout my day. I love that I can connect it to other apps to track my fitness.  I thought no it would be nice to be able to have a way to bulk add ingredients in the recipe feature AND be able to import recipes from websites.
3695,3695,5,2017-02-14T02:49:51.000Z,lanea1019,A Good Calorie Counter,"When I count calories, I don't expect to be on the dot accurate. I definitely think that Lifesum is interactive and a good guide to beginning to record meals and dietary habits. A constructive thing I might add to the app is the ability to edit items, meals, foods added (interns of nutrition tables)."
3696,3696,5,2017-03-16T16:41:00.000Z,Frannieks,Love it!,This app has helped me keep track of what I'm eating. It seems silly but seeing the little smiley face when I have a healthy meal really motivates me! I don't want to eat bad because I don't want to see the frown! Haha! I wish the premium version was free as well but overall love the app.
3697,3697,5,2017-03-19T16:28:55.000Z,Literally way too random,LOVE!,"I'm a teen and trying to lose some weight and just live healthier in general. This app is super helpful mainly because it's easy to use! I love the smiley faces that rate your meals- makes me feel guilty when I eat a doughnut for breakfast vs my normal oatmeal, and that's the encouragement I need! The exercise tracker is awesome two!"

I like how it gives you a life score, so I can continue eating the same meals. I would buy the premium if I wasn't a broke college student!"
3699,3699,3,2017-07-04T17:25:09.000Z,Tipmto,User friendly but not really a monthly subscription,"So far I like the app, food list is decent but certainly not exhaustive. I would love to buy the premium but it is advertised as $3.75 a month, but instead you have to pay all of it up front, close to $50. If the subscription was really a monthly payment option I would get it."
3700,3700,3,2008-08-13T03:54:14.000Z,Longdix,"Like the program, could use some minor additions","Used the program only 2 days now.  I like the daily charting and disply.  It's an app worth $10.  Having said that, I do wish you could create separate profiles and weight loss plans.  The preloaded foods needs to be expanded as well, perhaps a tie in with the restaurant app allowing the calorie info to import into your daily count."
3701,3701,5,2009-01-29T01:47:52.000Z,{BobaJohn},Great app,This is a well designed and very functional application. I have been using it for three weeks and I open this more than any other application I have. Plus it has helped me lose 10 lbs. My wife wants an iPhone just for this application.
3702,3702,1,2009-03-12T20:15:10.000Z,dave8183,I want my points back!,"I LOVED this App until today. I am doing Weight Watchers and loved the way this app tracked my meals and workouts. Even if my food item wasn't in the database there is an easy way to add your own food by entering calories, fat, fiber, carbs, protein, etc. I have lost 15 pounds since Feb. 1st using weight watchers and this app. I LOVED it, until the new update today took away the ability to track points! Does anyone know of a good app that tracks points like this one did? I am seriously so disappointed!"
3703,3703,3,2014-10-17T23:19:57.000Z,subgenius66,Would be better if...,"I like the presentation, but frankly I like MyFitnessPal's food database a lot better. It would be nice if this app would allow bidirectional sharing of nutrition info with other apps. A key advantage of HealthKit, in my opinion, is to allow users to get the best combination of features thorough multiple participating apps. No information silos. LifeSum isn't quite there yet, for me anyway."
3704,3704,5,2015-09-05T19:26:25.000Z,Fabio San jose,Great app!,"Easy to use. You can even scan a product barcode to get calories info! Great calories tracker. The free version also let you track fat carbs and protein. I haven't tried the gold version , but it is really amazing as is. I totally recommend it !"

This app is so helpful and it allows us to share it with each other! I love the reminders and that it cheers you on, even if you're forgetting some entering!"
3706,3706,2,2017-02-03T15:23:22.000Z,Eirura,Spotty app on both phone and watch,"They don't seem to sync properly on both devices and every time I add a bottle of water info on my watch, it gets deleted immediately. I can't delete info either cause the data will still appear on both devices or one device. It's so sad since the app has potential. I'll pay for a premium if it actually works across on both my phone and watch."
3707,3707,3,2017-06-08T03:27:36.000Z,Elieaime,Overall good app,Overall good app and it encouraged me to buy the annual membership. Question for the developers: it seems like the data from the Apple Watch activity and iPhone activity app get added up together in the calculation of calories burnt when they are the same thing. I noticed that this translates to calories burnt count that is higher than reality
3708,3708,3,2017-07-27T17:28:35.000Z,Loveitbutlikeits,A bug and premium,"I really enjoyed this app for the past couple of days- then it started freezing my phone when I opened the app. I don't know what it is, but fix it. I like that I can track my meals and see my intakes, but a lot of the stuff on here is purchase-only a.k.a. $34 premium. I am aware that this is normal for health and fitness apps but 90% of the app is for premium only."
3709,3709,1,2017-08-17T15:08:00.000Z,Shinranshoni,Buggy to where its unusable,"I love this app and the UI is great but the latest version has been buggy to where it's almost unusable. Adding a previous days meal causes multiple entries and tediously having to manually delete them. And the app freezes or crashes at least 20 times a day. I've sent multiple feedback reports and emails to let the developer no but I've received no follow up or reply. Makes me reconsider my yearly fee for going ""premium"" for a broken app."
3710,3710,5,2009-09-12T00:06:26.000Z,Elli in America,Excellent,"This app has helped me so far to lose over 10lbs in 7 weeks. It is simple to use and even though it took time to adjust the food database, it has definently been worth the efort. Having a export option like Spent and Spent lite would make it perfect."

3712,3712,3,2015-05-27T03:00:00.000Z,Joe robber,Beautiful but....,"They price it like a SaaS not a mobile app. $8.99/mo for one month of Gold. Or $36 for the full year. Kinda outrageous compared to other apps. It's a pretty and ok app but not worth that. ESPECIALLY because the calorie counts are all over the place and not accurate. You can only create 2 meals if you don't have gold. Overall: looks - 5 stars, nutrition data - 2 stars, price - 2 stars, UX - 4 stars."
3713,3713,4,2016-11-03T15:09:29.000Z,Maddiekdgal,"Good app, keeps crashing though","Great app, I really like it for calorie counting. Can be a little hard to pick out which food you want to choose because they have a BUNCH of options but not all of them are what you have and you can only add a couple foods on your own. But a really great and encouraging app."

I am trying to use points instead of calories, but it can't seem to add the numbers up.  It must be doing to some rounding behind the scenes with halves.  But it is very annoying since it doesn't show the halves with the food.  Just stick to whole numbers."

This is peoples' health we're talking about here! How can you be comfortable providing people with so much erroneous data?!?"
3725,3725,1,2016-03-05T17:03:41.000Z,Prycefam,SCAM!!!! DO NOT USE!!!!,"I saw this app appear, read about it seemed descent so I bought the 'gold' membership.  This was almost a week ago. Purchased the membership for $6 or so. It said that it would renew at $20 in 3 months May 4th was my renewal date and at that time I would be charged $20, cool no problem let me test drive the app. This morning I get an apple receipt thanking me for my renewal purchase of $20. So in a week Ive spent close to $30 on a an app. Lifesum, thank you for taking my money you freaking liars!!!!"
3726,3726,1,2016-07-21T01:42:38.000Z,ItsBrij,Not helpful.,"I've been using this app for almost a year now and today, after updating the app, I'm done. The newest features prevent me from logging my meals in one setting so I can't plan my meals out. Also, I workout in the evening or before breakfast not afterwards so I cannot log my lunch until I make up some fake workout. I really hope this is just a glitch and not how the app will function going forward, otherwise I'll be going back to my old meal logging app."
3727,3727,5,2017-06-24T03:12:17.000Z,Hump16,Great app,"Lifesum is a very useful app when tracking meals for weight loss. It's simple to use, the recipes are great, and the post are informative. No matter what I eat it's listed and that makes meal variations possible to post. I've tried similar apps for health and wellness but Lifesum by far is the best!!!"

It's helped us find holes in our diet, as well as track things like water intake. Lifesum puts other similar apps to shame. I absolutely recommend this to anyone"

3730,3730,4,2008-10-12T23:03:17.000Z,Me2004,Nice App,"Nice app - does what it says. Very helpful and easy to use. Check out their video - it answered my q's before I purchased the app. Some recommendations - can you add additional measurement field, i.e. arm, thigh or the option to add addtl measurements; a notes field would be nice too."
3731,3731,4,2009-11-30T14:24:46.000Z,Nptnagl,Better than lose it,"I like this ap so much better than lose it. It's more user friendly, it tracks more than just your weight and it has an online function option for searching products in addition to the reg data base. I'm happily surprised."
3732,3732,2,2014-10-13T21:45:02.000Z,Daniel Sochor,Cumbersome to use everyday,"The app is well designed and the barcode scanner is able to understand most foods. However, if you eat similar foods each day you can't copy them from the day before, you have to start from day one each time which is a major chore.  Similarly, there isn't a good way to adjust servings sizes when food is entered. The app has potential but it needs work."
3733,3733,3,2016-01-07T03:50:46.000Z,DevDiaz,Missing much needed features,"I love the interface but it's limited even with the premium subscription. I would like to see support for 3D Touch, the ability to put in our own recipes, a much wider database of food choices or the ability to manually add foods. Much of the nutritional facts are inaccurate especially when it comes to sugars."

Only wish they had the advanced option of 5:2--intermittent fasting so I could properly calculate my macros. Instead I'm following the macro and calorie count of the fat burner light program.

So if you're a fat nerd like me and you don't want to gain the freshman fifteen, I highly recommend this one:)"
3737,3737,4,2017-02-17T07:48:31.000Z,NellieBah,Great App,"I love the app, it helps me track my food intake. I personally do not believe in calorie counting, but logging my food intake helps me keep track of how much food I eat and therefore I am eating less. The app needs some improvement, I don't like the ""buy premium"" part, but I guess that's normal. I def recommend the app!"

The only downside is that there's so much food out there to keep track of but I use the ""create own food"" feature a lot to be sure I get the right nutrition facts."

I won't ever use another app. It's beautifully designed and easy to use. I'm gluten free and a lot of apps don't have a great selection of gluten free food to input. Lifesum has so many! I love it.

I can't create new items by entering all the nutrition information  and I don't understand why this isn't available. Also when I scan new foods if there is 0 grams of sugar it will say I have missing information and won't give a grade, super annoying. Wish I hadn't paid, if it fixed these things I would love it"

It's hard to track and log my calories and food intake if I can never even stay in the app for more than five seconds. Kinda disappointed because otherwise I would have given this app a five star rating😕"

I would also like to suggest a points calculator for those of us who are on weight watchers and a badge that shows the remaining amount would be nice too. I am putting this app in reserve in hopes that improvements can be made. For now, I'll have to stick with my cheaper, iTracker."

I still think the app needs some work though...I'm having a problem where all of a sudden all of the food i am entering for today is showing up in tomorrow's log! I don't want to be constantly recording food on the wrong day, so as far as I'm concerned this app is now useless to me.

This app is great and as soon as I can I'm upgrading to premium. Much better price than MFP's price with much more features.
3796,3796,1,2016-08-02T11:01:10.000Z,Lady gator78,App not user friendly,I'm very disappointed in the app. I signed up for a year Gold membership and the app turned out not be so easy to use. Don't be fooled by the free app. Buying a membership won't give you that much more advantage. Also I could not get past the daily tips to actually log any food or activity. Then when I asked for a refund they sent me to ITunes support. I'm still waiting for my money back from this useless app.
3797,3797,4,2016-09-23T20:32:37.000Z,qsam,Great but needs options,This app is really easy to use and has a good deal of foods in the database. I wish it had the option to turn off the day rating and I'd like to be able to use it to track the every other day diet instead of just 5:2.
3798,3798,5,2016-12-28T19:45:13.000Z,Maddie_b_h_,Amazing app🐶,Lifesum has helped me so much with getting back on track. It's very helpful with tracking my food and made me more aware of what I'm feeding my body. I found this app very useful in helping me get fit again. It's a definite must have app.

3801,3801,5,2012-05-23T03:46:04.000Z,ILoveSteve,Easy tracking of calories & exercise,LOVE this app--helped me lose 18 lbs and I still use it for maintenance.  It's really remarkable to see how many calories you are consuming every time you eat something--it helps you make healthier decisions.
3802,3802,5,2015-06-29T19:35:38.000Z,Angelaols,Love this app,"I have used many different apps of this sort and have found this one to be my favorite. Easy to use, helpful notifications, and has a layout that I love looking at. Highly recommend."

3804,3804,4,2015-10-07T15:29:06.000Z,OMG what a fake,Seems great so far!,"I switched for myfitness pal to this app. I've only had about two weeks, and so far I really like it! Considering upgrading to Gold but concerned. I've seen some good reviews and bad about gold. I'm a single mom, in nursing school; so while 2.99/month isn't much, it is if it is wasted!"
3805,3805,5,2016-03-05T18:30:18.000Z,Pancho Kachondo,Best app I ever tried for sure!!!,"Very useful, a extremely appealing app. I love how it keeps things very simple and organized not unlike other apps I've tried, I use it everyday I it has helped me a lot tracking my progress so far."
3806,3806,5,2017-06-20T21:23:03.000Z,Kawaii:),Really good,Very helpful for health because it can be used keep most of the data about the food your eating and the amount of exercise you do. It also provides healthy alternatives and meal suggestions.
3807,3807,4,2017-07-13T16:41:05.000Z,liftwithliv,Wonderful app,I've been using this app for about 6 months! I love it. Only thing that's tough is sometimes what I've eaten isn't in the app and I haven't figured out how to enter it so I can track it! Also wondering how to change the amounts as well! Otherwise I love it! Super easy to use!

This is the reason I deleted another health app and installed Lifesum, because the other app had this same problem. Please fix!!!"
3809,3809,2,2017-08-30T22:48:46.000Z,Rosegonz,"Good concept, too many glitches!!",I got the app due to a makeup guru recommending it. It doesn't let me finish adding food when the app closes and I have to start all over. I also noticed that the calories in the app do not match those on the product box. If this app didn't have all those glitches and if it would let me out in food without closing it would be great!

3812,3812,4,2016-05-01T21:42:51.000Z,Altavelocidad,Great but lots of room for improvement,"I love the app and it has great potential but there's a lot of features such as an ""add drink"" feature, a better scanner, and more accurate data and more products added to the list,much more exercises. otherwise it's awesome"
3813,3813,5,2016-07-24T16:51:14.000Z,MUCHIE-PAWS💋,Love it!,This app has really helped me with loosing weight. I like how they can select a diet that's just right for you. Since I'm going to be doing track as well as volleyball this has helped me maintain a healthy weight so I can be better at my sports.
3814,3814,5,2016-07-26T23:50:55.000Z,Cheleighknee,Love love it!,"I used MFP for years before switching to lifesum. I love the UI here so much better, it seems cleaner and easier to navigate. Also loving the recipes and helpful guidance. Best of all it seamlessly connects to my Apple Watch to grab activity, steps and calories burned. Fantastic!"
3815,3815,1,2016-11-08T05:55:14.000Z,East Bay Girl,Consistently Getting Worse,"App started off well enough with some bugs. But now app consistently freezes. And the biggest gripe is it won't save when exercise and water is logged in; or will save on the wrong date. The second you close out app and reopen, exercise info that was previously logged disappears. Extremely frustrating! Either revive previous, better working version or fix current bugs."
3816,3816,5,2016-12-03T15:44:19.000Z,Ross805,Great so far,Was having issues with getting enough/correct calories while cycling and this has helped a lot. No longer feeling like I need to eat all the sugary things in the house late in the afternoon.
3817,3817,5,2017-02-05T06:28:32.000Z,Jinxha,The premium update was TOTALLY worth it.,"I have had trouble reaching my ideal weight for a while, and I knew what the problem was. This app is wonderful for helping self control, especially if you are motivated by a clean, pleasing aesthetic. Great recipes, all around 5/5."
3818,3818,5,2017-05-09T03:21:07.000Z,Hurkljiff...:),Awesome!!,"Really helped me to track my calories and goes into more detail about how much protein and all that I need a day! It's really helped me to lose weight!! Also the water tracker is super helpful as well, and I completely recommend!"
3819,3819,3,2017-05-30T14:50:30.000Z,Em_51,Needs some work,The UX design is really nice and user friendly.
3820,3820,5,2009-10-20T08:22:32.000Z,my dog ate the radio,My favorite calorie tracker,Easier to use than others. I like the combined online database which allows me to find foods others jave added so I don't have to. Would like to see an option for entering entire recipes.  Love it
3821,3821,5,2010-03-04T20:54:44.000Z,Odd Ferret,I LOVE this app,"I use this app everyday. Just by counting calories, I've lost 8lbs since the beginning of the year and am making better food choices! I never realized how much junk I ate during the day until I started using this app. Awesome!"
3822,3822,2,2012-04-23T20:14:20.000Z,Georgyos85,Not fun to use,I think it is a nice app because it counts protein and carbs at the same time it counts calories but the database for food is frustrating to use. It definitely needs a barcode scanner and better description in food database so that we know we are choosing the right food we are eating. I just found it time consuming to search for the right food...maybe other people won't mind.
3823,3823,4,2017-04-30T16:08:38.000Z,nam946,Great app!,"I super love this app. Very user friendly and motivating! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to the limitations on the free version. I understand the desire to keep some options available for premium members only, however at least make the recipes free. Overall great app."
3824,3824,5,2017-06-08T13:46:26.000Z,Jannetmari,The best,"I've tried many apps of this kind and this blows the rest away. Easy to use, yet feature-rich. I'd be hard-pressed to come up with any suggestions for improvement."
3825,3825,4,2017-06-10T22:17:21.000Z,Ruth5692,Good but has bugs,"I just created an item that had 80 calories per serving. It saved it and all seemed well, but when I went back a minute later it said the item had 79 cal per serving and I can't find out how to change it back. :("
3826,3826,3,2017-06-19T19:00:06.000Z,LoVe3182,Premium,"This is a great app but with this new update, determining if overall I ate well for a day is now I premium feature. The reason I liked this app so is much is because there were still many great things available without needing a premium membership, and now that doesn't seem to be true."
3827,3827,4,2017-07-11T21:55:43.000Z,liloh_cando,Sync with Fitbit,"The app has a clean and attractive layout with a very comprehensive list of your macronutrient intake. My only complaint is that it only syncs your steps/calories burned, but not your food/water intake with Fitbit. I'm hoping an improvement on this issue will be present on the next update."
3828,3828,2,2017-08-03T03:46:07.000Z,Lily738373,Good app but could use improvement,"The like the concept of the app but logging the food part is kinda sucky there isn't very many options. Especially paying for it, it isn't really worth the money as a member. I did 4,000 steps and it logged it but said I only burned 1 calorie which isn't right. I've had that happen to me more than once, needs to improve."
3829,3829,5,2017-08-29T22:07:54.000Z,Btonnic,Great when it works!,"I loved this app and have been using it for 4-5 months now.  It was user friendly and convenient. HOWEVER, it has some major bugs and it keeps crashing."
3830,3830,4,2012-02-06T23:18:59.000Z,AssKickedbyKids,Fun and easy way to track calories,It is the easiest to use out of all the apps like this I've tried. The pay stuff really isn't needed unless you need to track nutrients. The other pay features can be worked around if you don't want buy in.
3831,3831,5,2015-02-26T01:41:36.000Z,SandyVanDerWalt,Awesome app!,"Beautifully designed, easy to use and incredibly helpful to track your health. It has everything: barcode scanning, integration with other systems and nutrition plans. Easily the best calorie tracking app out there."
3832,3832,5,2015-03-31T17:43:48.000Z,thisisdallas,The best tracker,"By far the best app to track food and water consumption, as well as exercise, very quickly and accurately. The design is clean and functional, and it'll be incredibly handy to have an iWatch companion app to go with the already easy iPhone app."
3833,3833,5,2015-10-06T16:03:17.000Z,house fan81,Amazing App,I love the barcode feature so I can scan my food/snacks!! I'm not sure why people are having such a hard time deleting items as I've had zero issues. The app is just incredible 👍👍
3834,3834,5,2016-04-23T22:28:26.000Z,Rllcrowe,LOVE IT.,It's amazing. I think that if you are looking to get healthier or lose weight or both you should use this app. Great for keeping track and will tell you how many calories you need to eat lose weight.
3835,3835,4,2016-10-29T01:12:42.000Z,Colorme6,Ratings,"Love the app! It helps me stay on track and teaches me what are good choices for my diet plan. One thing I wished it had... to be able to search food ratings so I don't have to constantly get frustrated in finding what I can and can't have! Yet over all, still love it 😊."
3836,3836,5,2017-01-29T21:40:42.000Z,Alex_Dynda,Excellent Apple Health Companion,"Maybe I'll sound made up for this, but this does more than I wished for and I'm all the better for it. A healthy recipe collection! It seems this system has been streamlined well. Would recommend"
3837,3837,4,2017-03-10T16:24:57.000Z,mizjai,Has me working for smiley faces!,It's funny how a the type of smiley face I get makes me curious enough about my choice of food to make a switch or two. Lost 5 pounds so far. Tracking my food seems to be a major part of the process for me and this app makes it a little more fun.
3838,3838,4,2017-03-13T03:46:30.000Z,carol98puuuuuliiii,It's great but could be better!,"The app is really good, but it would be a lot better if you could add some more nutritional information in it, like the types of fats, vitamins etc. Would make me feel a lot better about buying the year subscription."
3839,3839,4,2017-09-06T15:40:31.000Z,Njvtcocawa,Good app but won't stop crashing!,I decided to try this app out and I like it..I paid for 3 months to get a diet and I'll probably cancel when I'm done cause it's useless to me. Only annoying thing is that I can't ever input anything because the app crashes non stop!!!
3840,3840,3,2011-05-27T16:31:07.000Z,IzGrey,"Love the interface, but Calorie Count is free for the same features","Interface is fantastic. However, you can use the same pay for features with Calorie Count for free.  I would actually happily pay a one time price to use this app, but not a membership.  Calorie Count isn't as pretty, but it has all the features you need."

3844,3844,2,2015-09-12T14:32:09.000Z,Blueyes4,Not good for dietary restrictions,"Giving it two stars because the idea is great, but I couldn't find any way to accommodate for dietary allergens/restrictions. Thus the meal recommendations will not really help someone with Celiac's (like me) or another allergy as there are no substitutions or preferences to help personalize this for you."
3845,3845,5,2016-01-11T18:01:39.000Z,Grace voorhies,Great App,"Has great data base, good quality info, love the rating foods - very helpful, easy to use and sends reminders about drinking   or logging meals but does not give grief when I go over the plan!!!!! Enjoy having  it in my phone and IPad!!! Thank you!!!"

3847,3847,5,2016-05-10T23:27:51.000Z,Etta is amazing,I used to love it...,I used to love this app before it updated! Now I have no way to track my calories and my water intake. Please fix the issue or I'll have to start all over again on another app.
3848,3848,5,2017-05-08T16:06:16.000Z,BopalLep,Very helpful!,This app is perfect if you are you're trying to be more aware of what you're putting in your body and make better choices. I like that it's free and that you can do it with friends.

3852,3852,5,2015-07-28T18:41:08.000Z,Ctvdw,Great app,Syncs with the activity app on the IPhone to count steps and exercise data. Large database of various foods including protein bars that it reads with the camera by scanning the barcode. Even some chain restaurants are listed such as Red Lobster detailing the calorie content in their meals.
3853,3853,5,2015-09-24T03:02:39.000Z,Alex Novik,Love it,This app is genius. I've used it for about a week. I should upgrade by now but don't know if I want to pay monthly yet. Still testing it out. But I definitely recommend it. Real quality stuff.

3856,3856,5,2017-01-02T20:46:24.000Z,ThatNoobJacob,Amazing!,This app has helped me so much on my journey to losing weight. I've lost almost 30 pounds so far and I think it's the best tool for someone who wants to become a better version of themselves. Five stars from me!
3857,3857,3,2017-05-01T21:08:05.000Z,Evbae,Inaccurate calories,All of the calories are off by at least 1. I had a 100 calorie protein yogurt and it logged it as 99 calories. Some things I scanned would show up in myfitnesspal but wouldn't be recognized in this app. They need to fix these issues before I would think about purchasing it.

Also, that the menu is updated. Chick-fil-A serves breakfast now but there's no breakfast menu in the app to choose from. I'm sure they'll have an update later for it though.

3870,3870,4,2015-09-19T20:17:31.000Z,cealaska,Great app,"I love this app for a few reasons. It makes calorie counting easy, you can also record your daily exercise, and if you're looking to drop some lbs, you can specify how many and Lifesum will make a ""daily calorie goal"" for you to help achieve your weight loss goals."
3871,3871,4,2015-11-20T04:27:23.000Z,Pasnyc1,Good app,"I have been using it to track my calories, works great. My favorite part is that I get to scan barcodes of products on my daily intake notes, most products are scannable. I recommend this app for anyone wanting to watch what they are eating!"

Unfortunately I find the exercise data to be a little lacking. But I fully anticipate that with more time and updates it will get better. Loving this app.

When seeking support to fix the problem there has been no response, every time I go to send a email it says ""cannot process right now"" do not get sucked into there fake promotional price. They will just  charge you full price."
3874,3874,5,2016-05-03T17:31:59.000Z,Carmennnnnn_,Great app,The app is great. The only thing I didn't like was that I had to purchase the gold package in order to add more recipes/food but it's so cheap if you do the full year that it's worth it. I feel as if I'm doing pretty good with my calorie intake. 👍🏽👍🏽

By the end of the day it says I burned 1000+ calories just by walking which isn't accurate. I usually get 500 tops. It really messes up the calorie counting and makes me feel like I'm losing track.

I also can't find the custom calorie option anymore. The barcode scan is not working properly, won't scan products anymore that worked before. For me the app became pretty much useless because I can't count on the data anymore that I put in. I'm really disappointed."

When I returned to Lifesum, although the appearances look prettier, the product is almost impossible to use intuitively.  There are also many, many, just bugs (e.g. selecting US measurements but seeing only Kg in weight and food values.  The product has declined in usefulness over the last year and I had to give up using it."

Some highlights: Water Intake automatically setting itself to 8 cups, Meals being duplicated, daily calorie allowance changing for no reason, inaccurate weight chart showing current weight duplicated...

Not sure if it's easier to work and navigate since I've been using MFP for over a year now, but it wasn't too tough to figure out. My problem is that 1) to lean out it had me eating too few calories for my output level and had me eating 50% Carbs/30% Fat/20 % Protein (anyone that tracks macros knows that's way too little protein) and 2) I couldn't customize my macro goals."

I deleted this app last year because of this issue and I tried it again in hopes it'd be a little better. The barcode scanner also needs more accuracy. It will either give me the wrong food but the right calorie count/measurement or the right food wrong calorie count/measurement.

Oftentimes the program simply crashes out in the middle of adding a new food.  This is frustrating, and I suspect is reasonably common, as it is very rare to find shared updates to the food database for download."

However the grading system seems unfair. I could have a very greatly breakfast which earns me an ""A"", but as soon as I drank an 8oz glass of orange juice, Unhealthy! Chicken and rice with an Apple? ""C"". I don't think the grading system is very balanced. I would recommend having true nutritional experts weigh in on the grading of meals."

3909,3909,2,2017-09-04T02:35:19.000Z,C Borden,Potential,Started just fine on my iPhone 7 (with latest updates) for a whopping ten minutes...  now it opens and crashes.   And help?  Directed by the developer to go to support within the app.   How are we supposed to do that when the app crashes almost immediately?   Disappointed because I was excited at its easy setup...

Great idea but unreliable/buggy!,"If I could actually rely on this app to sync consistently with the iPhone app, as well as enable quick updates from the watch it'd be great. But, you can't... It crashes, freezes and is rarely responsive from the watch interface. I really like the integration across other apps, as well as the user interface, but without a reliable watch app it's somewhat of a nuisance."

Finally I am not sure if it my imagination but the food database looked French based."

3913,3913,4,2016-02-05T21:14:49.000Z,Teflonthadon,Almost there …,This is a beautiful app and very easy to use. The UI is bar none the best out there. The food grade is helpful not sure how accurate it is but non the less gives you an glimpse why it's a D grade. My ONLY gripe is the weak food database. They need to seriously fix this

3948,3948,2,2017-05-25T18:44:01.000Z,megankay48,Not loving the new update,"I've had this app for a few days & was loving every part of it, but the new update for the apple watch removes all of the interactivity that was available and makes the watch almost useless.  Please remove the avatar and revert back to the old version and I will definitely change my review back to 5 stars!"
3949,3949,5,2017-06-26T16:07:44.000Z,H_Smo,Great app,"Not only does it track you, but it sends you motivational messages too. It gives you a detailed health plan to fit your specific needs."
3950,3950,1,2008-10-26T20:35:13.000Z,AlexW..,Great idea. Terrible execution.,"I want to like this app, but can't. It took three tries to setup my profile. IShape is slow, buggy and doesn't work. The food percentages are wrong, and adding food doesn't seem to work right.   There are numerous spelling mistakes throughout the app. I'm going to put it on the shelf. Hopefully an update will be usable, otherwise I wasted $10."
3951,3951,3,2012-05-15T20:14:47.000Z,Jmaddox1213,Not so much,"I used this app everyday for almost 6 months and then it stopped letting me ""create food"". So every time I needed to add a food that wasn't in the database, I had to get on the computer and add it. I like Myfitnesspal way better, because you can scan the barcode on whatever you eat and add it that way."
3952,3952,5,2015-07-09T03:35:57.000Z,Swaggorilla,So fun and useful!,After 90 days on MFP I switched to lifesum and love it so much I wish I had used it in the first place. It's super easy and artsy (especially the little water glasses ;) ) and it is such a fun way to track my health. Keeps me goin man!
3953,3953,5,2015-10-28T00:14:17.000Z,mcowell526,Update is great!,Simple to use and great features.  Definitely my favorite health app thus far.  HealthKit integration is awesome.
3954,3954,1,2016-03-12T01:28:28.000Z,lucaskd,No!!,"Let me start by saying this is a beautifully designed and user-friendly app. I used it primarily as a food journal, but I can't get behind the injustice it's doing to people accepting and acknowledging these food ratings as accurate. Frankly, it's unethical to (mis)lead users to believe that a Diet Coke is an 'A' and regular Coke is an 'E'. Tisk, tisk... Hoping for a moral update 'cause the app is otherwise a great tool for tracking intake + outtake!"
3955,3955,4,2016-12-30T19:58:23.000Z,11010 Steve,Great!,"It's a great app, but I have one problem. When you choose the weight loss plan, it asks you for your weight, and what your ""goal weight"" is. So I entered both it said ""try a different number"" for my goal weight. But that is my goal weight......."
3956,3956,5,2017-01-03T13:29:39.000Z,Zigoat,Easy and simple,I am surprised that the free version offers as much as it does. The food tracker has a wide range of options making it much more accurate.
3957,3957,3,2017-03-15T21:48:51.000Z,Sammcbettis,Great if you pay for it,I caved and bought the premium account for 3 months to see if it's worth it and u suppose it is. My main gripe is that all the recipes are in metric measurements and I'm a xenophobic American and I need my dumb imperial measurements that I'm used to! Idk what the heck 200g looks like! An option to convert inside the app would be awesome.
3958,3958,3,2017-07-21T16:40:06.000Z,vpqm2,it keeps shutting down!!,"I have been using the app for 3 days and I was loving it, but now I can't get it to stay open!! it opens for a few seconds, then just shuts down. I was going to upgrade but I will probably delete it by Monday if the problem isn't fixed"
3959,3959,4,2017-08-22T12:32:51.000Z,CVespa,Normally enjoy,As of lately this app has really helped me track my macros which has been a little difficult in the past.
3960,3960,4,2009-11-06T14:31:41.000Z,sbharris,What can I say!,I have had this app for about 6 months now and I have lost 25 lbs.! The food database is huge! The only thing that I would like to see different would be it's ability to calculate body fat %. You have to rely on an outside source.
3961,3961,5,2013-02-12T18:31:04.000Z,MoseyD24,Love it!,I can really say I love this app! I have been using it for three weeks and I have lost 9 lbs in this short amount of time! It has changed my life on how I eat and I am very happy with my weight loss!

I will def give five stars if some of these get fixed thanks id love it more!!!
3965,3965,2,2017-04-14T20:17:21.000Z,girlyrita13,Keeps Crashing,"I just downloaded the app last night and really liked it - it worked great.  Today I tried to open it and it keeps crashing - every time I try to open it.  I'd love to continue using the app, but when it won't stay open for more than 10 seconds, it isn't usable. :("
3966,3966,1,2017-04-30T06:20:26.000Z,JCDearest,Bugs!,New to Lifesum first week went smoothly. Now I'm having issues with the weight tracker. I update my weight every morning but the app has gone nuts and changes what I entered to 30 pounds less!!! I keep switching it back to what's it should be but every time I open the app to log meals and water intake it has dropped it again to 30lbs less that what it should be. This is becoming very unreliable
3967,3967,5,2017-07-31T14:55:50.000Z,Poppyksimpson,Great app,"I really like using this for my Keto lifestyle. Keeps me posted on where I am throughout the day and easy to use. I haven't had any bug issues yet, so everything is great so far!"
3968,3968,5,2017-08-02T00:22:11.000Z,JenJensMac,Love this app!,I love that this app keeps me accountable for what I eat. I have a goal in mind of how much weight I want to lose and this app really helps me stay focused. I love that it talks to my Apple Watch and tracks my workouts!
3969,3969,5,2017-08-02T17:01:11.000Z,Ellaxio,I love,I've use this app for two weeks to track my caloric consumption and I have lost 10 lbs. it's amazing how much of a difference one can make tracking what they eat
3970,3970,5,2014-08-03T06:20:58.000Z,yamyx,Best app I've used,I've used several apps before but this is 100 times in front.
3971,3971,5,2014-12-24T08:09:08.000Z,Dutch latte,Just awesome,Best way to keep track of all the calories you eat a day.
3972,3972,4,2015-05-22T01:47:08.000Z,Polevata314,Great app!,"For some reason the syncing with the Health app is a little off...it gave me 3 repeats of the same exercise. It should be possible to delete them like on the website. Other than that, it does all that I wanted and more! Very sleek and very useful."
3973,3973,5,2015-08-21T13:56:55.000Z,KatePiv,Easy to use,"I have been using different apps, but Lifesum was the easiest! It takes me less then a minute to put in all food for the day. Really nice advises and reminders. Simple, easy!"

3976,3976,4,2016-05-29T18:55:30.000Z,Jenmgrace,Better than expected,I have been using my fitness pal for a while. I wanted to see what the difference was and have been pleasantly surprised. The app tells me where I'm being deficient in my nutrients and gives good recipe suggestions.
3977,3977,2,2016-08-16T17:54:44.000Z,K2M2Pizzle,Wish it was more user friendly,"I really wish this app was easier to add recipes. If it was, it would be perfect. I cook a lot and having to add each item is too time consuming. My Fitness Pal has an option to import recipes from online. If this was the case, I would keep my subscription and continue to use it."
3978,3978,5,2016-10-20T12:49:52.000Z,Chocolate addict SK,Very accurate,It's amazing how detailed this app is I've downloaded some other apps before which had a bad quality but this one hasn't failed Me it is amazing
3979,3979,4,2017-01-11T21:42:12.000Z,Ms6339,Love the app but.....,I love this app and how it rates your meals. It would be extremely helpful if it gave suggestions to go with the meals to make it a better choice. I have yet to get a complete healthy rating and I don't know what I'm missing or should omit from my meal.
3980,3980,5,2011-02-23T08:57:50.000Z,Janey_Girl,I like it a lot!,I think this application is the one I use the most. The interface is very simple to use and I like that you can find all the foods you need by searching. Thanks!

3982,3982,5,2016-04-30T15:01:58.000Z,flowerp,Macro counting made easy,"While I don't use all of its features, lifesum has been the perfect companion to an important body composition change.  I will probably keep using it indefinitely."
3983,3983,5,2016-09-22T01:23:21.000Z,Wickawickawhaa,"GREAT APP! However,",If they were able to make monthly payments an option for premium that would make it more attractive to buy.

Doesn't refresh/update weight even if entered. Would be nice to have option to check food nutrition without going into a meal - if I'm grocery shopping shouldn't have to pretend I'm entering food for breakfast."
3990,3990,2,2013-11-06T02:30:33.000Z,Okkony,New Upgrade is a Disaster,I've been using this app for a while and always liked it until this last upgrade. The new graphics are pretty but it freezes and crashes constantly. It can take five or six attempts to sign on and them freeze in the middle of an entry. Very unhappy with this as it's so hard to use.
3991,3991,3,2015-09-21T01:35:43.000Z,Jaimeleigh426,Good but inaccurate,"I like the app. I like that it reminds me to track and drink water. I love the motivation it provides. However, the amounts and calories in many of the foods are inaccurate and the exercise isn't able to be customized with time and calories burned. Needs a few updates"

Now it does it by steps. So for example, if you exercise first thing in the morning, you can't enter it before breakfast. Not everyone is on the same schedule. Take off the steps and it's perfect again!"

But after paying for premium I realize now all the problems with it. Some of the nutrition information is wrong and it seems to not even know how many ounces there are in a cup. In addition the search function in the diary is very poor. Save your money on this one.
4025,4025,4,2016-07-14T12:29:50.000Z,Pintrestforlife,User friendly,It's easy to use. The lookup list is what keeps me using it. I'm not a serious calorie counter but this keeps me aware. It has helped me to make more conscious choices. There's a lot of useful things in the free version.

I feel like it happens when you go back and fort between days to compare your progress. I just want to highlight that this should be fixed and if it is, this would be my go to health app"
4027,4027,5,2017-02-01T22:58:18.000Z,Evejoe2,Food Tracker,This is a great way to jump start your weight loss.  Tracking your food is the number one way to lose weight.  I'm a fan!
4028,4028,4,2017-02-24T03:17:42.000Z,Марго_МК_0000,Good!,Great app! The only thing is I wish it would suggest meals/foods based on the carbs/fats/protein intake.
4029,4029,3,2017-07-28T18:25:29.000Z,Crazychickidae45,"Used to love it, now it's kinda glitchy","I started using this about 2 weeks ago and it was AMAZING! But over the last few days, it's started to become glitchy. The app freezes, the walking count is always off and keeps resetting. It's too bad, LifeSum was so good!"
4030,4030,5,2011-08-23T19:38:06.000Z,*.:Abby:.*,Loves it!,I love this app! I use it everyday! I've lost 4.5lbs and I've only been using it 2 weeks!! I only wish they had more food options and more workout options..
4031,4031,4,2015-03-18T15:09:16.000Z,TrisBanshee,Could be better,It's very easy to use but it is a little hard to find some foods on the app and especially hard to find the correct workouts
4032,4032,5,2015-04-19T18:55:07.000Z,jpleno,Love!,I loved Lifesum and it's interface so much that I upgraded to the gold membership within the first day that I got it! It holds me accountable and lays out everything in front of me to clearly see. 😊
4033,4033,2,2015-07-21T00:29:09.000Z,Omnine,"Good, but currently buggy","Though the gold-level prices are a little steep, it's a good app marred by bugginess. The worst is a newer issue wherein adding saved meals to the daily diary adds them to the following day instead. Not great when 50% of the time the app fails its most basic and critical function."
4034,4034,5,2015-07-21T07:23:12.000Z,StefanWülf,"Solid, extendable calorie tracker","Easy UI, extensive food database which is simple to add to. Wish units of measure were more consistent. Good goal-setting options. Have been using it daily."
4035,4035,5,2015-09-08T19:06:54.000Z,Sam razian,Completely satisfied--highly recommended,It absolutely worth the price...you can gain or loose weight or be more healthy...it organizes your life in order to having a great shape...enjoy
4036,4036,5,2015-09-18T19:44:40.000Z,Fitfirst231,Great,"Great app to meet goals for strength training. Most apps just try and get you to lose weight. Not here, you can program meal plans to put on size and strength and not just cut down. Great stuff."
4037,4037,4,2015-09-24T17:36:58.000Z,Happy go lucky lady,Love the reminders,To track meals & drink water etc. will not upgrade as i've been on this app for 1 week and i usually have trouble staying connected or motivated soon.  Maybe with the reminders it will help.
4038,4038,5,2015-09-28T23:43:44.000Z,Jacklovee,Such a great app!,I like this app better than any of the other apps that track calories. I hope they also input the Paleo/Whole 30 in the diet book for the CrossFit freaks!
4039,4039,5,2015-11-07T19:33:59.000Z,SolitaireSerenity,So far so good,I'm in love with this app! The key to it is to stay proactive and motivated or else it won't work for you. This is the first app I saw that catered to weight gain which made me hype! And so far it helps to keep me on task.
4040,4040,5,2015-09-10T11:21:47.000Z,ZennyHein,Losing weight!,Great app. Helped me to stay motivated in order to lose 17 pounds in 7 weeks. I am from another country and many of the dishes we eat are on this app.
4041,4041,2,2015-09-27T03:31:51.000Z,Cürran,Lame,This app needs work I would like to be able to delete items I accidentally added. For the example I entered a generic item but actually found out listed the real item. If this could improve and also not be so expensive for something that's easily done in another app.
4042,4042,3,2015-12-26T18:05:59.000Z,sjcpilot,Good app but upgrading is pushed too hard,"Like the app, like the motivation. However, upgrading to a $10 per month plan is not worth it and pushing it on the user so aggressively is annoying and distracting. Myfitnesspal is a better choice for a completely free and fully usable app."
4043,4043,1,2016-06-28T11:52:10.000Z,Leahbee232323,Don't purchase - they change what you purchase and no refunds!,I purchased this app (full year membership) specifically for the keto feature and one day I open the app and they no longer offer the options for that diet! When contacting them they would not refund or help out in any way! Don't purchase theirs tons of free apps that are much better out there like myfitnesspal!
4044,4044,5,2017-01-07T04:25:42.000Z,Robrogan,Finally a useful combo,"I love the diets and suggestions, but the recipes really make this more than just calorie counting which many others don't go beyond."
4045,4045,5,2017-01-11T20:55:47.000Z,Get it do it,Fit is sweeet,"Very good app but the only thing is not to many exercise options like when you go to the exercise option but  ""excellent"""
4046,4046,5,2017-01-30T03:39:13.000Z,A. Mata,So far so good,Learning so much about food and how to have a more balanced diet. Already losing a little weight- excited to see where it takes me
4047,4047,4,2017-07-25T17:44:56.000Z,dawoodmansour,So far so great!!?,"Hello first of all amazing app, great layout and good features. I've just started and I really want to lose weight do you guys promise this will actually help me? And does this app notify me when I lose a pound? Good tracking system 👍🏼"
4048,4048,3,2017-07-28T02:29:44.000Z,Zincabarone,App crashing,Hello not able to contact you thru the app because it shuts down after opening and you do not have an email on your website for assistance. Upgraded to premium and now app closes after opening. Please advise. Thanks.
4049,4049,5,2017-08-25T13:48:21.000Z,Brnbor,Bugs,"All this app does is crash my phone and watch.  Please fix, I just upgraded to a paid membership and now I can't use the app."
4050,4050,5,2011-09-20T22:09:12.000Z,gk001,Great!!!!!!!!,"I like this program alot, but i would like another update that could include what time the food was input. This would help ppl space out their meals during the day..."
4051,4051,3,2013-02-25T02:35:06.000Z,MrsGreenJr,Good App,"I like this app. It's easy to use and keeps you on track. However, I wish you could use other features without having to upgrade. There should also be more diverse exercises in the database as well as food options. Overall, I love it!!"
4052,4052,1,2015-06-25T08:37:50.000Z,Leonard Cooper,In app purchases are broken,"In app purchased is completely broken. I have bought year membership almost a week ago, and still do not have it. Tech support claims I was logged into different account while purchasing. This is ridiculous. Taking into account that they answer once a day this is getting really annoying."
4053,4053,5,2015-07-15T22:17:02.000Z,Ldisme00,Love,"I love this app very much. It is simple to use and very efficient. I don't get bored with logging foods, and I have definitely lost weight from using it. 10/10 recommend 💘"
4054,4054,4,2016-10-13T00:41:56.000Z,Queen yogurt,❤️❤️❤️❤️,I love this app! It is perfect for tracking foods because they have every brand in their system so you can record exactly what u ate and it's calories! The only thing I would change is to have the app GIVE A ONE-TIME PAYMENT OPTION INSTEAD OF MONTHLY!
4055,4055,4,2017-01-15T08:17:12.000Z,GirlyBaseballChick,Very Handy App,I'll probably purchase the premier but I'm still just getting started. The app really gives me the ability to track everything I want. I can also link it to the iPhone health app.
4056,4056,5,2017-05-09T19:14:08.000Z,gepper247,Great app,This app is great for understanding food! One small thing is it's hard to pick the exact right brand of things sometimes. But other than that great!
4057,4057,4,2017-06-02T14:52:00.000Z,Boudiccacruz,Confused a little,So far it's an amazing app and I love using it. BUT the subscription says $3.75 a month or $40+ a year. Do you only have to pay by month or the whole lump sum at once? Just a little confused on that.
4058,4058,3,2017-06-18T01:36:48.000Z,kittenmitten245,Great Graphics but...,"The sleek design is refreshing, but everything useful costs extra. The silly thing is- these extras are free in other apps. I'm not going to pay $30 upfront for a 6 month commitment to an app ""extra."" I can get the same info for free pretty much anywhere else."
4059,4059,5,2017-07-11T18:59:24.000Z,PittStateRocks,Trial,It was great at figuring things while still researching macronutrients and how it all works. So much more efficient than counting calories. Will definitely upgrade soon.
4060,4060,5,2012-01-26T18:44:08.000Z,AtillaZI,Love the shape up,It is a great tool to use to know how much calories that you are taking. This helps to see what kind of food selections I need to do to loose wait. Helps me big time.
4061,4061,5,2013-03-20T08:18:31.000Z,MarinaSn,Very easy and simple,A huge database of foods it what i appreciate the most. You can take advantage of using  foods that other members created and also add /create your own
4062,4062,1,2013-12-18T03:11:25.000Z,DavisFlyer,Don't buy it!!,I was ver happy with shape up. I had almost one year with the golden subscription but they recently change to this and change everything. Nothing works now!
4063,4063,5,2015-08-21T19:55:34.000Z,Maggie schultz,Helpful and easy,"I just started today, but this is so simple to use and I think it will help me on my journey to lose weight and improve my health."
4064,4064,5,2016-03-04T01:04:44.000Z,Anime rocks 4ever,Review,"This app works very well. Though I have just downloaded it, I can not wait to see my weight loss process with the help and guidance from this app."
4065,4065,3,2016-03-17T15:34:57.000Z,Splunket,"Works, but not very user friendly.","Downloaded for the iWatch compatibility. Missing a few features, and user interface is a bit difficult to use, but overall, performs the desired function."
4066,4066,5,2016-04-21T19:49:03.000Z,Rnprac,Amazing,Best health app out there period! The choices in diet are perfect and so essential because not everyone can follow the same diet plan. I have gluten allergies and I tend to eat more fat than carbs . This app rocks my life
4067,4067,4,2017-07-01T19:57:43.000Z,CHIEF DANK,Exactly what I was looking for,App has it all you really can't go wrong with all the features it has for free. The premium seems like it's something I would purchase in the future.
4068,4068,4,2017-07-21T21:39:57.000Z,Former Fitbit Loyalist,Love it,"The experience is great, intuitive.  The look and feel is modern and easy.  Love the idea of the different plans and feedback on food logged.  Please add more food plans and recipes.  Also an integration with Hidrate water bottle would be great."
4069,4069,4,2017-07-25T12:44:56.000Z,mel.adventure,Handy and Easy to Use,"The app is very easy to use and is super insightful. I would like to see ""vegetarian"", ""vegan"", or ""whole food plant based"" as diet options. Mine is currently set to standard although I eat a whole food, plant based diet."
4070,4070,5,2015-11-21T02:31:56.000Z,Ewinen01,Very useful and straightforward,This app is great for not only helping me to see what I'm actually taking in but also to keep my on track with a healthier lifestyle. Keeps me motivated.
4071,4071,4,2015-12-27T15:02:20.000Z,Ani886,Great app,I'm really enjoying the app. I just downloaded it yesterday and I'm loving it. It has almost everything I would like to see a place for vitamins and supplements on the tracker though. That would make it the best!
4072,4072,5,2016-03-13T15:29:30.000Z,CreativePiglet,Amazing,"This app is great! You can insert almost any food or exercise. The calculations and response time is immediate. The only suggestion I have is to add more types of exercise (i.e. playing with kids, washing dishes)."
4073,4073,5,2016-05-22T23:42:42.000Z,Isabella HC🐘,Great!!,The ability to scan barcodes makes tracking calories so much more convenient.
4074,4074,5,2016-05-25T11:48:57.000Z,Jmandala,Awesome support for ketogenic diet,"I wanted to try a ketogenic diet and this app has been a fantastic support. Honestly, after 6 weeks using the tool, and eating keto, I can say I've never felt better!"
4075,4075,5,2016-07-04T20:03:24.000Z,Erin2127,Great so far!,I've only been using this for a few days but I'm really liking all the features and food choices so far!
4076,4076,5,2017-01-17T16:14:57.000Z,JessamynGilbreth,Love it,"This app is amazing, it makes me feel better about how I eat and that I'm makeing the right health choices. Can't wait to upgrade it to the full version. 😍"
4077,4077,1,2017-01-23T12:38:57.000Z,UYA002,Crashing Every Few Seconds,I really really wanted to love this app but I haven't been able too because it keeps crashing before I can get anything done!! I like that you can see your calories and macros at once and it's beautifully made but I haven't been able to log much because it keeps crashing. It's ridiculously frustrating!!!
4078,4078,5,2017-02-09T21:53:06.000Z,Leleshreds,Feeling healthier than ever,Helps me keep track of my daily activity and how much food I should be eating to keep up with my workouts
4079,4079,5,2017-03-15T14:53:17.000Z,Rytheguy71,Stick with it!,"Great app that helps you stay focused on you. Dieticians all say to notate your caloric intake and monitor your exercise routine, this so does it all. Stick with it, and be honest with yourself and YOU WILL see results."
4080,4080,4,2012-01-26T18:21:52.000Z,ereckert,Solid App!,I like this app better than some of the other calorie-tracking apps I have used. The list of foods in the database is extensive and pretty accurate. I have recommended this app to several friends.
4081,4081,5,2013-06-18T23:27:54.000Z,Bailey7875,Easy to use,"Easy to keep track of daily protein requirements, which is a challenge since I love carbs and am vegetarian. I like that I can create favorites, meals, and look up foods online. Great app."
4082,4082,5,2015-05-18T17:43:10.000Z,Missyharm,Logging food easier,Makes logging meals so much easier and let's you know if you need to eat more to keep you on track. Awesome!
4083,4083,5,2015-09-15T00:13:06.000Z,Almighty Goddess,Track your day in food & exercise,"Makes it easy to track food, calories & water each day!"
4084,4084,4,2016-07-07T15:29:50.000Z,Fitandfabandfun,Improve,Love this app!! Would like to see more connections with restaurants though so I can log my food better and see which options on the menu are the best for my meal plan!
4085,4085,4,2016-11-15T20:02:28.000Z,Awqdmhfvwegfsrhgeg,Me gusta,Very helpful just two inconveniences. 1) sometimes it doesn't have the food you ate and you can't add it and 2) I'm not going to pay to see meal plans and stuff but I wanna see them! No big deal though lol
4086,4086,1,2016-12-14T17:09:25.000Z,vm911,The New Look is Horrible,"I've been using Lifesum religiously to track my food, water, and exercise this year, and have been loving it. However, I HATE the new look. Smiley faces instead of grades? Not only is it not as accurate, it's also really childish, and not as motivating. I don't like the new color changed from the original green either."
4087,4087,5,2017-02-03T00:50:09.000Z,Kkkkaymck,Get this and reach your goals!,So easy to use and fun! Offers a lot of different options to help you stay on track. Get it.
4088,4088,5,2017-03-13T13:59:08.000Z,Jwinar,Great for Change,This is a great app with a bunch of eating programs that you can change to keep things fun and interesting and it syncs with everything!
4089,4089,3,2017-07-31T21:17:39.000Z,StevieYouin,You have to pay for everything now,"The app used to be pretty good for everyone, but now you have to pay for premium to do basically everything and I feel like I'm not getting much out of it anymore."
4090,4090,2,2008-08-18T03:23:10.000Z,lunastarxo,Can I get a refund?,"This app most definitely has potential..  but right now it's a total waste. I spent $10 expecting a wide array of foods to choose from.. and it figures that nothing I eat is in here! Update the foods! People eat out, people eat and drink name brand foods! I uninstalled it until there's an update. It's gotta get better than this!"
4091,4091,5,2010-03-17T23:06:13.000Z,Muslim girl,Super helpful for diet and exercise counting,I really love this program I think it's my dream to keep all what I put in my mouth writen down now it the chance to do it and free thanks for this app makers I love u diserve 5 stars.

4093,4093,5,2011-11-02T00:31:03.000Z,Amy Bray,Live This App,"It is super easy to keep track of everything I eat and see how many carbs, fat, and protein I eat in a day. Easy to search the online database and find foods to add."
4094,4094,1,2014-12-06T06:39:38.000Z,Bangkoker,Many Inaccurate calorie counts,"This is basically a calorie counting app. Since its subscription based, I expected it to be extremely well designed AND with an excellent food database."
4095,4095,2,2015-12-05T18:25:20.000Z,Slovesdisney,Slim variety of food to choose from,"I love the look of this app. However, the lack of food and exercise listed in the data base makes it difficult and time consuming to use. I have to look up and manually enter most foods that I eat."
4096,4096,5,2016-04-10T23:32:49.000Z,Terrial1180,Love this app,Fantastic app. Easy to use and so many different ways to count food. Love that I can check out other ways to diet and or eat healthy.
4097,4097,5,2016-06-19T02:44:47.000Z,Hoepe16,Favorite health tracking app,I love this app.  It is clean and easy to use.  This is the first app to really encourage me to drink more water.  I like the different diet options and recipes and the scoring of my meals.
4098,4098,5,2017-08-06T18:17:20.000Z,KyleHorkley,Looks and works great,I care about how apps look and this one nailed it. Not only is it easy to use but it's everything I want in a fitness tracker.
4099,4099,4,2017-08-20T19:35:42.000Z,Rowil07,I am loving the app,I am loving the app but it seems to start glitching and shutting itself down every once and a while along with twice today before I could add any data.
4100,4100,4,2016-01-11T17:24:45.000Z,docs user,Lifesum,This app is great because it does the basics of tracking calories and exercise but a lot of the features aren't available unless your a gold member or something. Overall this app is great
4101,4101,5,2016-01-25T23:02:15.000Z,02deathscythe,Very satisfied so far,Of all the food log/diet apps I've tried I find this one to be the easiest to work with in terms of both user friendliness and utility.
4102,4102,5,2016-07-18T16:41:42.000Z,Kajonejo,Lost 50 pounds using Lifesum,"What more can I say? So easy to use, let's you focus on your day-to-day health efforts without spending much time recording information."
4103,4103,3,2016-12-12T20:15:18.000Z,continuousboredom,New version is confusing.,The new version has smiley and frowning faces instead of letters to rate the foods and meals. I like the letters from early versions 100 times more because it's so much more professional and less confusing. Otherwise the app is pretty fantastic.
4104,4104,5,2017-02-16T03:48:49.000Z,Reviews4You,Easy to Use,I always come back to Lifesum when I start tracking calories again.

4106,4106,5,2017-07-01T14:39:09.000Z,Neiszy,Love,So far I'm loving that this app focuses on nutritional value and not just calories also love the happy and sad faces for some reason makes me want to get all smileys and the water consumption
4107,4107,5,2017-07-13T00:07:56.000Z,Mhopman31,Great,An easy convenient way to keep track of what and how I eat.  I feel more confident with my body and the calories I consume on a daily basis to maintain a healthy lifestyle!!!
4108,4108,4,2017-07-14T12:07:37.000Z,emmy_louu,It makes me feel a little healthier.,I'm tracking my exercise and calorie intake for my wedding. I was recommended by a friend to use this app. It does a pretty good job with tracking the food. The exercise is another story...
4109,4109,2,2017-07-23T22:38:20.000Z,DarlingDollface,"Just downloaded, app keeps crashing","I don't normally write reviews but I was really excited about this app. I've had it for all of 10 minutes.

4113,4113,5,2012-01-29T14:03:51.000Z,Kalmstone4,Great App,I love how everything you need to help you lose weight is all in one app. I even can keep track of inches. I recommend this one for everyone.
4114,4114,5,2015-04-27T21:17:45.000Z,AZ Hkergirl,👍,Love it!  iPhone app much better than on computer because water tracking is really helping my compliance and success.
4115,4115,5,2015-05-14T01:35:03.000Z,Highimjustme,In love with this app!!!,Easy to use and understand. Love tracking my calories and seeing how many calories I've earned with my exercises. My new favorite app!
4116,4116,4,2015-07-12T19:06:13.000Z,kingfish225,So close,There is not one good tracking app that has it all. I've tried loseit and myfitnesspal and I don't have the confidence they know what direction to go in. Lifesum is getting close and I feel they are focused enough.
4117,4117,3,2015-07-25T20:32:24.000Z,bobojan,Syncing,I got this app because it's compatible with Apple watch. Unfortunately it doesn't always work. You get some of the info but not all. I paid for an upgraded version and that doesn't seem to help either.
4118,4118,4,2015-09-17T13:11:06.000Z,lgeiger5280,Functionality,Needs to have a diary portion so you can track how you feel while experiencing the new diet.  Also agree that it should sync with the Bodyspace app to include all the lifting routines I have built for caloric burn.
4119,4119,3,2017-08-01T01:05:25.000Z,suzeroonie,Needs option to make your own recipes,"I really love this app so far, and I would be willing to switch from myfitnesspal to this app IF they let me build my own recipes and track how many calories are in the things I cook!"
4120,4120,1,2016-05-18T23:03:03.000Z,DanFruhauf,They just want Money,"They keep slowly taking features away unless you pay for the monthly subscription (which is super expensive, for a few mediocre features)."
4121,4121,5,2016-08-30T18:00:49.000Z,Phtephen G,"Great functionality, fun to use",Easy to get started and use.  Would be nice to see more options for variation in the water intake screen.
4122,4122,1,2016-11-01T19:36:00.000Z,CakeOrPie,Recent updates = duplicated activity,"In the past two days, something has happened (10.1.1? 10/31 update?), and Lifesum is now recording multiples of iOS activity -- both iPhone and Apple Watch -- rendering activity tracking (and, thus, calorie counting) useless. I would love to have walked 38 miles yesterday, as the app said I did, but those were calories I'm afraid I didn't earn."
4123,4123,5,2017-01-16T16:07:47.000Z,Shaina21,Easy to use,I like be the barcode scanner and all the extras like recipes and things that come with this app. Even just the free version is amazing!

4129,4129,3,2017-06-18T14:51:56.000Z,Rachgutz,Whhhyyy,I really like this app but I have a Fitbit and it won't let me sync my steps or workouts without having preminum. So because of that I'm gonna give it 3 stars and I'm gonna delete it😞 without my exercise syncing it's pointless. My fitness pal I can do it on the free version 🙁
4130,4130,4,2011-08-29T17:30:02.000Z,Jroddy4,Great app for great health,"I have used the ShapeUp app for about 14 months and recommend it enthusiastically and without reservation. I have lost and kept off 20 pounds. It's still up to you, but this is an excellent tool to achieve and maintain a healthy lifestyle."

For a free app best one I have used!!

The design of the app is nice but the fact that the barcode scanner still forced me to manually input the info of a Sierra Mist bottle just proves how much work the food database needs. It's useless to me otherwise. Everything else was solid, but this is crucial. I wish I could get my money back, to be honest. Most terrible investment yet..."
4133,4133,5,2014-12-08T16:13:28.000Z,martin-nyc,Looks slicker than ever!,This app has really helped me to take actionable insights towards my health goals. iOS HealthKit integrations is great as well as data import from Withings and Runkeeper. Big fan!

4136,4136,1,2015-11-05T21:36:28.000Z,Kristinsmith22,You can't cancel,"It's not a bad app, too much work for me, but when I tried to cancel, it told me I have to stop payments via the source of funds - so I have to contact my bank or whatever. I can't even figure out how to change payment methods. This is completely scammy. I would never recommend something that clearly does not care about the consumer."

4140,4140,5,2010-07-11T07:35:23.000Z,Sktowery,Love this app!!!!,Perfect app to keep myself in check and it's really nice that it shows an estimated time in which to reach your goal...keeps the motivation level high:)

The grading on meals is very inaccurate. For example, I don't understand how a meal of Greek yogurt (A), blueberries (A), and raspberries (A) averages out to a D grade. This doesn't make sense. Please fix soon or I will be asking for a refund!!!"
4145,4145,5,2016-07-24T20:25:07.000Z,celiakagan_88,Much better than Fitbit,I love this for tracking my macros. I'm an avid home cook so I use the recipe feature CONSTANTLY! Worth the premium membership and love the recipes in the community.
4146,4146,5,2016-12-29T14:23:01.000Z,RoenW,Awesome little app!,"Finally, a fitness tracker that doesn't have ads! It also delivers what it says it will! Apple watch app is pretty bad though."

4148,4148,3,2017-08-07T17:06:21.000Z,Fhdodfbfj,Good idea but not for everyone,This is a genius app but it won't let me input the weight I want to be. I'm 70 now and I would like to gain 10 lbs. It won't let me use 80 lbs as my goal. I don't want to gain 30 lbs soon as I am still growing and that's pretty unhealthy for me. Please fix soon!

I'm healthier when I don't track my weight or focus on it, so that makes this app useless for me."

4151,4151,3,2016-11-22T01:53:05.000Z,Sassmann,Good parts and annoying parts,Overall great app and idea. It is nearly impossible to log food. I cook and do my weekly meals. It's very hard to log all the different ingredients. Logging food is hard and if simplified I would change to 5/5.
4152,4152,4,2016-12-20T03:08:51.000Z,merisadesu,Frequently crashes,Love the app but the new version crashes so much that it does not allow me to do anything!!! 😭 Once that issue is resolve I'll be able to rate it five stars!
4153,4153,5,2017-01-22T21:07:54.000Z,Katttieeee021,Aesthetic,With the newest update it looks really nice and it's easy to use. I like the sound it makes when you fill in a water glass.
4154,4154,5,2017-01-23T02:53:46.000Z,Rizzys,This will help me lose weight,I just started using it and it is very informing and does the best with telling me what I should eat and what exercise I should do

I've had an experience where it didn't update at all for the entire day. Should I just switch back to myfitnespal?
4171,4171,4,2016-05-21T20:06:53.000Z,Daniellei30,Good app,App really helps you see what you're eating in a day. I wish it allowed you to modify the recipes it suggests to reflect what you may use so that calories and nutrients would be correct.

It's integration with Apple Watch has been shaky. It's impossible now. It rarely imports my activity from the watch. It's so manual intensive now I'm switching apps.  Also been charged twice for subscription. Was 3-4 stars at one point. Now worse.

4174,4174,3,2016-08-16T23:18:34.000Z,Frank1716,Great app,This app is shows a preview of the paid app. This free app is very limited due to the trial version but it calculates calories and all. The downside to this app is having a lower diverse choice of food. This may not have your food if its not a top brand. This app is still very beneficial.

4201,4201,4,2015-04-13T02:19:27.000Z,Wakes Up for Class,Pretty sweet - definitely helped me become healthier,"The water feature is ESPECIALLY nice. I do wish the they subtracted calories when you input workout information, though."
4202,4202,5,2015-08-25T01:51:33.000Z,K!k!..,Very convenient,Just starting and I'm looking foward to losing some weight over the next few weeks..!!
4203,4203,5,2015-09-16T22:59:43.000Z,Blackwater49,Great at guiding weight loss!,"With an Apple watch, the Health App, and Lifesum's interface for tracking what goes in my mouth and how that relates to exercise and steps, it makes loosing weight predictable and sensible."
4204,4204,2,2016-01-24T02:05:48.000Z,WhereWhy,Had high hopes,"I use this app for two days, and now I'm deleting it. I have the Apple Watch, and the data will not properly sync between the watch and my phone. Everything that I logged on the watch gets overwritten, as soon as I open the app on my phone. Sorry. I tried."
4205,4205,1,2016-01-29T04:42:08.000Z,Awesome7182626,Don't Buy It,"Don't get suckered into buying the Premium version. The free app was promising so I expected the paid version to be better. Wrong. I can't even tell what's different except they alter the macronutrients slightly. $50 to tell me a ""high protein"" diet has more protein than a balanced diet. Canceled my subscription and will never even use the free app again out of disappointment. Snake oil salesmen."
4206,4206,5,2016-03-20T05:24:29.000Z,Shawn Mc278,Great little app,"I like the variety of diets, allowing me to track my plan based on my preferences. The regular reminders are really great, too!  Worth the upgrade!"
4207,4207,3,2016-04-28T04:54:04.000Z,kindannoyed123,Its aight,"This app is average at best, there are other very similar apps that so more and work better. Im disappointed that there are very little exercises you can add in for example I simply tried to put ""side crunch"" as an exercise I did and it couldn't find a result!"
4208,4208,5,2016-05-06T18:38:59.000Z,Piper kitty,Great app,I've been using this app for about a month now and it's really helping me stay accountable for eating healthier and to lose weight!
4209,4209,1,2017-08-09T23:31:22.000Z,LadyDrakina,Useless,"While this app is aesthetically pleasing, functionally it's a mess. When it works, it works fairly well and has the potential to be THE food/ activity tracking app. Unfortunately, it crashes, freezes my phone and is utterly useless more often than not. I'm quite dissatisfied and thankful that I'm not paying for the frustration."
4210,4210,1,2016-02-27T16:57:51.000Z,stexanie,Hilarious,"You have to buy a membership just to have the ability to pair fitness trackers (heart rate monitors, Fitbit, Apple Watch) to the app."
4211,4211,3,2016-05-12T15:54:36.000Z,Fun guy?,I like it,I do like this but it needs to be easier to use. I want to be above to easily creat foods that this app doesn't have. Also choose how much water I specifically want to drink. I do like this up but it needs some improvements
4212,4212,5,2016-06-04T02:41:36.000Z,HeloVeganBlondie🍌,Best Nutrition App I've Used,This is probably the only nutrition app I have ever used consistently in my life. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
4213,4213,5,2017-01-09T05:42:11.000Z,Ellabella2017,Love it!,This app is great!! Very easy to use and has a visually pleasing design. I use this app daily to help track everything I am eating to help gain weight. I am very grateful for this app!
4214,4214,5,2017-01-20T03:51:33.000Z,Drover and Missus Boss,CRASH,"I love this App but today it keeps crashing and I can no longer use it to log my day. Please fix, I really need it!! Thanks."
4215,4215,5,2017-02-22T04:03:49.000Z,Tculv,Awesome,This app has been an amazing way to keep track of water and everything I eat and enjoy doing it!!
4216,4216,5,2017-02-22T19:43:02.000Z,MylesParrish'sWife❤,Amazing & Helpful,"Definitely download this app, it's easy to use & keeps you motivated. I've never felt healthier & I'm going to keep going"
4217,4217,2,2017-02-27T17:21:03.000Z,Linettex3,Not better than my fitnesspal,You'd have to buy the premium of Lifesum to get the same free stuff AND more with the free one of my fitnesspal. My fitnesspal also has a premium version which offers even more things for you. Lifesum looks nice but it's not as smooth to put everything in as MyFitnessPal. Just not a fav.
4218,4218,5,2017-03-28T04:01:55.000Z,lubibul,Really motivates me to be healthier!!,it's amazing what tracking your food will do to you mentally. I've learned so much about how healthy or unhealthy the regular foods i eat are. Lifesum is great!
4219,4219,4,2017-08-01T17:53:31.000Z,Compelling!,Great food tracker!,"Great app for logging my macros and fitness.  The smiley faces are a huge bonus! I highly recommend this app.  Can be a little ""glitchy"" and sometimes get stuck but recovers quickly."
4220,4220,5,2008-12-05T05:04:44.000Z,Cubantico,Amazing,Great app. I was looking for something like this for a long time n I got it on sale ..it may not have all food info available but it is a great app.
4221,4221,4,2009-01-31T05:18:21.000Z,gimme my iphone,luv my I phone,I just love this app.  I have had it for about 2 weeks now and couldn't do without it.  It's a fun way to track what you eat and how you' re coming along with your diet.
4222,4222,5,2014-12-08T16:02:30.000Z,l_f_richard,I like it!,I have been using it for a while now and love that it’s getting better for each version!
4223,4223,5,2015-06-08T22:08:25.000Z,Girl.Next.Door,Great!,I usually use my fitness pal but I tried this and now I'm hooked! I love that it tells me if I'm over for a meal and that it reminds me to drink water throughout the day
4224,4224,5,2015-10-25T21:32:40.000Z,Loc Lyrics,Highly recommend this app,This app is user friendly. It records and help keep track of all meals and water intake and fitness activity.
4225,4225,5,2017-02-25T23:12:31.000Z,--Kurtis--,Love it!!,"Not only is it super cute and visually pleasing, it's really helping me figure out how I can become a healthier vegetarian, soon to be vegan, and (mostly) raw vegan sometime in the future! Thank you!!"
4226,4226,5,2017-04-10T12:38:20.000Z,Musicgirlychick,Love it!,This is the only app that actually helps me with weight loss in a efficient way! Highly recommend
4227,4227,5,2017-06-17T07:43:46.000Z,Kellyann4444,Thank you Aspyn and Parker,I've always used my fitness pal but Aspyn was talking about this so I decided to try it! Use this as well now and so far I like it.
4228,4228,5,2017-07-02T19:44:19.000Z,Fellowship of the Blaze(ps4),Lifesum,Lifesum is an amazing app for anyone who wants to be healthy and for anyone who cares about their nutrition! Is extremely easy to use and has a wide variety of foods in its database.
4229,4229,4,2017-08-18T02:15:27.000Z,class101:),Love It,"Unlike other apps, Lifesum makes it very easy for you to keep track of what you eat without having  to spend extra time counting calories yourself. I love it and this is THE OPPORTUNITY WORTH TAKING!!!!👌👌👌"
4230,4230,5,2008-09-02T02:39:35.000Z,Deoji138,Great App!,"I tried to just leave this feedback, if it goes twice, oops... I love this app! It has been very motivating.  Please add other measurements (like cups, ounces, etc) to the ""add food"" part."
4231,4231,1,2008-12-22T14:09:35.000Z,crd3818,Horrible,"Very few selection of different kinds of food. They don't have a simple turkey sandwich as a meal option, but you can sure select anything from Arbys or mcdonalds menu. Seriously, anybody on a diet or trying to keep healthy shouldn't even think of eating anything from a fast food joint. Not user friendly at all. I want my money back."
4232,4232,3,2012-06-23T15:29:24.000Z,Jean-Marie Vogel,Please adjust exercise calories to weight!,"OK but calories lost per exercise should be adapted to weight, which doesn't seem to be the case. If you are little, it will overestimate by up to 1.5x or do the amount of calories you lose per exercise."
4233,4233,5,2015-05-22T17:17:05.000Z,Jaylam evAns,I love it,"I love how this app allows me to keep up with what I eat and what I burn. Thanks to this app, I have managed to loose 30 pounds. Keep making lives better lifesum."
4234,4234,5,2015-10-19T01:31:02.000Z,Jwoo1273,Love it so far,Easy to use. Pretty design. Wish I could easily swap items from one meal to another though.
4235,4235,1,2015-10-27T01:47:07.000Z,NaffyTaffy,Don't Pay for This!,"The advertisements for the purchase options are gravely misleading. You get exactly the same thing you would get on a free app - maybe even less. The only nice thing is that you can pick diets, but good luck finding recipes on the app. In addition, the math for allotments is crazy. No one should be eating only 800 calories a day! Not worth a penny."
4236,4236,5,2016-03-23T05:27:47.000Z,CelesteandTravis,Awesome app,I really like this app. It allows you to create you meals. Also you can scan barcodes and it puts the info in for you.
4237,4237,5,2016-04-10T15:00:18.000Z,Bpeeler7503,Love it,Great app . Only improvement needed is on iOS having to force close it for it to pick up steps from iOS health
4238,4238,5,2017-01-22T19:30:11.000Z,MackAmber,Love it,I love this app! The only suggestion I would give is maybe change some of the intervals on things
4239,4239,2,2017-07-29T10:39:15.000Z,haileymariah,Nothing special,"I find this no different than MyFitnessPal pal. I actually prefer MyFitnessPal. The only outstanding thing I find with this app is the recipe section...which you have to upgrade to the premium to use, so nothing special with this app. I would just op for MyFitnessPal if I were you!"
4240,4240,5,2015-09-19T15:04:36.000Z,Bodiya,Super App,Recently added Lifesum to keep track of calories and fitness. Keeping me on track the pounds are dropping and I can login on the go 👍🏻
4241,4241,5,2015-09-20T23:21:37.000Z,Tracking food and exercise,Lifesum,"The best app for tracking your food. The new part that you get graded for your food is really awesome , I would recommend this app to everybody"
4242,4242,1,2015-11-07T00:14:57.000Z,KristinaYogi,Use Runkeeper and Pinterest for free!,"There is nothing convenient about this app, it imports data from other workout apps or you have to manually input it. It offers you recipes - but I can tour Pinterest for a more tapered appeal. And there are No Refunds after two weeks. Plus customer service is less then charming. Major thumbs down!"
4243,4243,3,2016-01-11T21:58:59.000Z,idiot_dogbrain,Could be better,"I’ve used My Fitness Pal for years, and I liked the look of this one. Especially the letter grades for foods or meals. But the database is small and inaccurate. The recipe builder is so bad, it’s not usable. It could be the best food tracking app ever, but it’s not there yet."
4244,4244,1,2016-04-16T18:50:59.000Z,ceejayy3,No customization,A fitness app that doesn't let you customize your macros or calorie count MSU use the standard diet. I should be able to make my own custom diet. Terrible. The only good thing about this app is that it is good-looking. Also canceling your subscription or trial is almost impossible. I am really unhappy with this and immediately uninstalling.
4245,4245,3,2016-08-26T15:41:51.000Z,Ale j.,Good but needs some work,I love this app to keep track of my food and help me meet my goals. I do wish the app worked better with my Fitbit. I would definitely give it 5 stars if that part worked properly.
4246,4246,1,2016-09-26T17:27:26.000Z,cccccccollin,Don't switch from MyFitnessPal,Thought I'd make the switch after using MFP for a long time. I won't make that mistake again. Every thing I eat throughout the day is not logged correctly into this system so it makes everything difficult to log. If it's difficult to log then I'm not going to do it. Total fail.
4247,4247,5,2017-01-11T13:50:08.000Z,JayAbq01,Great App!,I've tried a couple other apps and this one is best! Simple interface and easy to use! Thank you!
4248,4248,5,2017-05-21T18:40:31.000Z,Meggers😍😘🤗,Love this app!,"This app is amazing! This app is keeping me inspired to workout, drink water, and eat healthier. I love how you can find the food you ate and it shows the carbs, fat, and nutrition percentage"
4249,4249,5,2017-06-03T22:24:14.000Z,Professor Kliq,Well Thought Out,This app does a great job of making it VERY easy to keep track of things.
4250,4250,4,2013-03-24T18:42:23.000Z,KimberlyAnnAb,Very useful,Very useful. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because there isn't a flat price to get the full version you have to pay for the service monthly.
4251,4251,5,2015-04-19T19:05:08.000Z,devinreams,Best tracker I've used,Tried many others and love the style and functionality of this one.
4252,4252,5,2015-07-18T17:29:57.000Z,swanson215,Just started today,So far so good. I've done other apps like this but so far I'm liking this the best. I love the reminders for water.
4253,4253,5,2017-03-02T00:25:20.000Z,Beeonker,❤❤,"Here after I saw it on Jamie and Nikki, and I absolutely love it. I don't mind paying the 5 bucks, this app is very helpful and keeps me on track!"
4254,4254,2,2017-03-09T12:57:35.000Z,Shudson8808,Disappointed,"Wish I wouldn't have paid for a year subscription. Creating meals/recipes are very time consuming, you can't share a meal with friends and I've had a lot of products that are no in the system. Cancelling subscription..back to My Fitness Pal."
4255,4255,5,2017-03-13T18:05:31.000Z,Lo Slye,No Macro Left Behind,Once I got use to using this app I realized just how easy it is and how well it keeps me on track!
4256,4256,5,2017-06-18T00:07:51.000Z,Nish__Supreme,Tough App To Top,I've never experienced a nutrition/fitness app like this! This offers so much and it breaks it all down. It's highly motivating and fun to use.
4257,4257,2,2017-06-30T04:46:30.000Z,yesnomaybeso86,Be ready to spend money...,"Love the ""idea"" of the app, but it is overpriced. You can find free (MyFitnessPal) and cheaper apps that do the same thing and don't cost to view nutrition value. That is basic information that you shouldn't have to pay extra for to track."
4258,4258,5,2017-07-25T01:50:22.000Z,1947392819,Great app.... just one thing,This app is the best calorie counter app I've ever had. The only thing I would love to see would be if it could connect to SWORKIT.
4259,4259,5,2017-08-31T02:36:09.000Z,Sarahannlady,Awesome app to track intake levels!,"I practice a plant based diet, so his app really aids in tracking my protein intake and helps balance everything else involved!"
4260,4260,5,2015-10-26T12:49:10.000Z,theonewhoishteone,Better than my fitness pal,"Super simple to use, and better than lot other apps"
4261,4261,5,2015-10-29T13:47:30.000Z,Rachesthetician,Amazing!,This app keeps me on track. I'm trying to build muscle so I love that I can just enter or scan a barcode in for each meal.
4262,4262,5,2015-12-22T20:42:20.000Z,Balqa,Love it ❤️❤️❤️,"I've lost 6kg in one month since i started using this app 🙆🏻✨. It's very useful,, limits your daily cals and gets you into the habit of drinking water,,"
4263,4263,5,2016-03-26T00:11:57.000Z,Geezylouisy,So far so good.,This app has more features than lose it. It has good tools and incorporates my exercises into the calorie count.
4264,4264,1,2016-10-06T01:41:19.000Z,Kbc610,Misinformative,"Lifesum oversimplifies the information it tries to present, and in doing so it ends up giving you a very warped understanding of your diet. Healthy, wholesome foods like bananas, hard boiled unsweetened applesauce, and mushrooms are given poor scores for ""high in natural sugar"" or ""calorie dense."" Also, the nutritional facts such as serving size and calories are wildly inaccurate. There are many better apps out there!"
4265,4265,4,2016-11-25T21:43:16.000Z,Shabbys,Great but....,Lifesum is awesome. I have make lots of healthy decisions with this app. The only issue is that to get most of the good stuff you have to subscribe. It costs a lot of money but has a ton of fetuses that come with it.
4266,4266,1,2016-12-12T09:43:59.000Z,Rex Maximilian,Still lacking for watch support,Mammoth update? ...but no functionality added or bugs fixed for AppleWatch? Kind of a joke...
4267,4267,2,2016-12-22T02:23:43.000Z,tdnvl,Giving up,"I've tried the premium plan, I've engaged with support, I've waited for updates, but now I give up."
4268,4268,4,2017-02-09T14:36:52.000Z,Kat1509030,Awesome App,If I wasn't a broke college student I would buy the premium version. I use this app everyday to count my macros and keep myself on track. It's easy to use and I absolutely love it.
4269,4269,1,2017-02-12T17:35:59.000Z,Mollyruiz12,Not good,"Not a good app, l was looking at this app as a trial to see if I liked it when the subscription thing came up. I was only looking at the subscription when it subscribe somehow and now I can't cancel it. Be aware that once your subscribe you won't be able to cancel it and will be stuck with an app whether you like it or not"
4270,4270,5,2011-04-27T04:30:01.000Z,K@r0L @nDr3@,Amazing!!,"I think think this app is great! It keeps me aware to where I have to be and track in order to loose weight, in a healthy way!!"

4277,4277,4,2017-07-09T07:16:17.000Z,Dudepremiumtho,I want to be healthy but also not broke..,I have seen other comments about this and I completely agree. This app is helpful but to extent of you can't afford the upgrade.
4278,4278,5,2017-07-13T17:06:25.000Z,Mar731,It needs...,To let user put in the amounts of water. The two choices don't match the fluid oz if using a 20 oz glass or cup or bottle...other than that I love it!
4279,4279,5,2017-07-14T17:39:54.000Z,N.r.r.,Best comprehensive nutrition app out there,I have tried most all of them and this is the best and most positively motivational for a variety of users
4280,4280,3,2015-09-04T06:51:40.000Z,Rachel671,Pls fix,"Sometimes when I scan items, it will show the correct calories but when I look back, it will only show a portion of the amount. Doesn't make any sense. Pls fix"
4281,4281,4,2016-01-04T03:22:24.000Z,GrayRat,"Easy to use, Good interface with Health App",I like using this app to stay accountable and follow trends in my food and activity. The grading system is good but sometimes misleading. It gave my kettle chips an 'A' and my fresh carrots a 'D'!
4282,4282,4,2016-02-02T19:56:28.000Z,Jarbesu29,Please fix instructions for recipies,They are not showing up. You can only see a few lines and then its cutoff. Im anxiously looking to make some of those recipes but cant. Please help!
4283,4283,3,2016-02-13T15:18:11.000Z,Agent 003,Can't upgrade,Same problem as other reviewers. No way to upgrade. Page highlights benefits of upgrading but no button to click.

4291,4291,3,2009-01-31T19:45:28.000Z,Elizyhill,Need to adjust calorie goal,"Had this app since 10/08 and it is ok. I really need to be able to enter a daily total calorie goal and this field seems autocalculated and fixed. For me, this would be big improvement."
4292,4292,3,2014-09-28T13:34:51.000Z,bbbbbllA,Can't upgrade,I really like this app but it won't load the page for gold. I have tried for three days. It's just a loading symbol. If this gets fixed it will be a great app & I can give it more stars.

The look of it and scanning capability are nice. It would only let me create 2 recipes within it for free though. I'm going back to my fitness pal :)

4323,4323,2,2017-02-22T01:13:28.000Z,KyEdMiPy,Great app if you want to pay for a subscription....,Absolutely useless unless you pay for a subscription. At $4 a month I feel the app should at least automatically input the food I eat for me and knock me on the back of the head when I go for my ninth donut.
4324,4324,5,2017-02-24T00:26:56.000Z,DRose209,Recent update,The recent update makes my app fail to sync with my Fitbit app. Even if I sync it manually. Fix this.

Also, while you may set you macro percentages, your settings are not reflected in your daily diet plan.  Overall"

4329,4329,3,2017-07-23T19:19:32.000Z,Bbarrentine,Good app but....,Does not accurately detail your steps and calories burns. It also starts over like in the middle of the day and erases all my calories burned. That is annoying. So I know I won't use it past the 30 day trial. Fix it please :)
4330,4330,5,2012-04-18T17:13:24.000Z,ShapeUpAddict,Love it!!!,"I really enjoy this app. Used to write down calories in a food journal. But with this app, pen and paper are no longer needed, much less a calculator."

4352,4352,1,2016-06-15T00:00:34.000Z,kimbuda,Automatic renewal,I don't even remember signing up. They charged me a year in advance with no warning they were going to renew a so-called gold membership. I searched my emails and found a few uninspired recipes and the same old diet advice. I'm sure I never agreed to pay $42 in advance for a years membership. Another scam you out of $$$ company.

You must enter the calories per 100 grams, then enter how many ounces you ate. Great for anyone with a scale handy. Very inconvenient otherwise.

If your looking to have the same great tool try Loseit.... It's the does the exact same thing (minus the cool profile before and after shots) but is free!
4382,4382,3,2012-12-20T22:23:59.000Z,maxfxmusic,Good but,Good but a lot of useful stuff is locked and works with a monthly fee only. Would be better to sell the app for 9 bucks and then give full access to everything.

4384,4384,4,2017-03-13T03:25:22.000Z,Kool K.,Lifesum is a godsend for exercisers!!!,I think Lifesum is really an experienced app that helps people with everyday health and fitness routines by watching their dietary habits and seeing their body intake of how they see themselves and their lifestyle.
4385,4385,3,2017-04-05T05:37:40.000Z,TDechance,Needs improvement,The app started out working good but now it keeps adding cals and tells me I need more throughly the day even if I go over. It would be nice if it stayed at the amount of cals you set per day and when you go over the circle becomes red.
4386,4386,1,2017-04-13T02:27:24.000Z,missjeanbrodie,Up -sell City,"No use even getting it. Constantly asks you to upgrade. App is designed to just get to you buy upgrade. So annoying to have buttons on every screen saying,""hey loser, why don't you upgrade?!? How about now? How about now?"" Oh, frowny face- you ate a cookie. Upgrade to premium to get rid of that cookie weight!"
4387,4387,5,2017-05-01T17:09:20.000Z,Skyler Meow,Good,Does everything its supposed to do and runs smoothly. Plus the design of the app is very pretty.

4394,4394,3,2016-03-17T18:41:45.000Z,Daisy64!,Love the app. Not happy with recipes.,"So I started this app today. I saw the lunch recipes and decided to try the tomato cilantro avocado. Well when I added it to my lunch diary, it gave me a D. Why is that? I mean if it's not that great to eat, why suggest it? Doesn't make sense."
4395,4395,5,2016-05-13T21:49:32.000Z,Youdawongone,Lifesum app is great!,"This app is very useful for your everyday health. Although some parts require gold, it's still a pretty good app. Keep this up."

4399,4399,5,2017-01-07T02:08:19.000Z,Ghoulscout619,Awesome tracker,I am really enjoying this app. The barcode scanner makes tracking your meals so convenient.
4400,4400,3,2009-08-23T17:53:30.000Z,Shoetr,Great app...but needs some fixes,"Really good app for tracking calories and workouts, but it crashes everytime you try to enter a custom time for exercises. Once that's fixed, it'll be a five star app."
4401,4401,5,2011-04-24T13:37:30.000Z,Happy___user,Great app to keep you on track!,This app has all I need to keep up with my daily food journal and more.

4404,4404,5,2012-05-29T14:53:23.000Z,KJB17mom,Great app,"I am having fun with this app.  I have not had any problems.  I don't have the gold, the plain one works great."
4405,4405,4,2013-10-20T14:09:08.000Z,MBAS2010,Fantastic update!,Shapeup now remembers the foods you usually eat at each meal which makes entering them even easier. Love the new look as well.
4406,4406,4,2015-03-28T17:41:42.000Z,Me2965,Umm....,This was a great app before the new update but now I can't even open it on my iPhone 4s and it irks me. Why does it crash every time I try to open it?
4407,4407,5,2015-05-02T22:56:49.000Z,Archangelofonyx,"It's such a great, fluid, and perfect tracker app!","I switched from ""Lose It!"" to this app and I couldn't be happier! I love the water tracking section!"

4410,4410,4,2008-11-13T02:23:29.000Z,Chrizy33,Jbl,This really has everything that I'm looking for but I can not figure out how to change to counting points not calories.  Can anyone help please
4411,4411,3,2016-02-11T13:01:38.000Z,Melanie-Kay,Upgrading to gold!,It won't let me upgrade I click on the buttons and then it takes me to a screen that explains what gold is but doesn't let me upgrade.
4412,4412,4,2016-06-14T08:59:37.000Z,mte1234,Great app but with some bugs,"When I try to open an account tab the app crashes, and I can't add more than 2 liters of water a day?!"
4413,4413,5,2017-03-08T01:23:04.000Z,yeahdudefed,A1,I highly recommend this. Better than anything out there. It's responsive and it looks GREAT!

4415,4415,1,2017-03-29T22:39:25.000Z,Mygirls0709,My fitness pal is better,"I personally like my fitness pal better. It has more a variety on brand name foods to choose from. I couldn't find my starbucks drink which is very simple, and they didn't even have an option for me to track my smoothie king smoothie so i had to just put the calories."
4416,4416,2,2017-04-14T01:15:49.000Z,Monstaballa,It's okay.,"Helps keep me on track with my diet. I just wish you didn't have to pay month by month for the app, or else I would probably pay for it. Also, it has been crashing a lot lately."
4417,4417,1,2017-06-11T12:20:25.000Z,ZonieGirl,Not worth it,"Advertised low carb recipes. So u downloaded the app. Oops, recipes cost money. Seriously? I can find free recipes on the internet all day long. Myfitnesspal free version does everything I need it to do, and doesn't try to lure me in, only to charge me money for the advertised feature. Deleted after 15 minutes. Bye, Felicia."
4418,4418,4,2017-07-08T15:59:39.000Z,Gay boy45,Works well,Too many ads for the premium version
4419,4419,4,2017-09-05T00:32:50.000Z,Alanabana11,Pretty good,Works well. Wish it had a better way to calculate calories for meals. Overall it works well for my purpose
4420,4420,5,2008-11-27T05:18:22.000Z,Jack Knightly,Great App,"Best app out all off the food trackers. It is easy to use, update, and has tons of foods already listed. This is by far the best one."

4423,4423,5,2013-02-23T20:44:41.000Z,Joao Caetano,Great app,"I tested many calorie counters. Shape up is the best and most flexible one. I lost 8 pounds in 8 weeks and will lose 10 more, thanks to Shape up."

4426,4426,1,2017-05-28T23:56:21.000Z,Tulltill,Don't get if your 12 or younger,My friends' cousin couldn't use it because she was 12 years old. I find that at any age you can set goals and you don't have to be limited by your age. It says 4+ on the AppStore but I guess it was a lie. She was so upset and she wanted to try it out because she had an AppleWatch of her own.
4427,4427,5,2017-06-02T15:59:06.000Z,Afro_Alex,Convenient,Great for keeping track of calories
4428,4428,1,2017-07-05T01:34:31.000Z,Hdec,Must have premium,"This app would be fantastic but you have to pay quite a bit each month for all the features. You can log your food without it, but you have no access to the other features like recipes etc."
4429,4429,5,2017-08-07T23:08:56.000Z,Momma carter,Love this app,Super easy to use. Love to just be able to scan the barcodes  and love the flexibility of the plans
4430,4430,1,2016-03-14T20:20:52.000Z,Bkalexj,Incredibly disappointed,"Paid for the gold membership and have seen no benefits. The ""meal plan"" are just one meal per day with no option to choose something else or plan ahead and see upcoming days. There are no exercises. And worst of all, no way to contact support. Buyer's remorse is strong with this debacle of an app."
4431,4431,5,2016-05-03T05:02:57.000Z,Jojodiggs,"Easy to use, informative.",I really appreciate the upgraded version of this. It's also a way of keeping more cognizant of what I'm eating.
4432,4432,2,2016-08-02T17:01:48.000Z,Popomerk,Server error (500),I LOVED this app but recently it disconnected my Fitbit and every time I try reconnecting I get a server error! It's super frustrating not having accurate data on the app and therefore not consuming the correct macros!! Please fix this problem!! Thanks
4433,4433,1,2016-09-10T17:36:41.000Z,Player45732587,So mad at myself,I can't believe I actually paid for this app.  It might be OK as the free version but don't go spending money on it.  There are so few recipes and additional information that is truly not worth it.  And they make you sign up for at least 3 months and it's not easy to cancel.
4434,4434,5,2016-11-21T08:20:16.000Z,Lukeness213,Love it,Helps me track everything
4435,4435,5,2017-01-06T02:41:58.000Z,Rebecca90,I like it a lot!,It's easy and kind of cheerful and I like it better than myfitnesspal for sure.
4436,4436,1,2017-01-13T03:38:46.000Z,Ahjisai,Worked once 😡,I used the app last night and it worked beautifully. Tried to use it tonight and it crashes constantly after a few seconds. Force quitting and delete/reinstall did not help at all. I was so hopeful this would be something to help me.
4437,4437,3,2017-01-30T22:55:29.000Z,starr274,"Good App, UI aggressive ad prone",The app is pretty good in its basic functionality but it's gotten fairly aggressive with the ads for premium in recent updates to the point of feeling like a car salesman or a gym membership
4438,4438,5,2017-02-03T20:41:08.000Z,Health maniac,Good,This app has really help put my food intake into perspective. My only complaint is the price for premium.

4440,4440,5,2009-03-11T21:28:29.000Z,soul4souls,Great App!,The two key advantages of ShapeUp over similar apps are: the abilities to backup and restore your data and email summary reports in PDF format.
4441,4441,5,2010-12-04T14:25:05.000Z,Jay1971,Best app,I started using this app 3 weeks ago and gas already lost 8lbs. It really guides you in the right direction with your meal.

4443,4443,2,2015-03-10T01:23:19.000Z,Raymond Brigleb,Good but not great,It only has a few basic diets and they're kind of obscure. HealthKit integration seems okay.
4444,4444,4,2015-04-26T12:53:28.000Z,Chole1518,Very good!!,This app has made staying on a diet so much easier. I have already lost 4lbs. I will continue to use this until I reach my goal!
4445,4445,5,2015-04-26T17:54:52.000Z,JBBmeomyo,A great app,"I've only been using it for 24 hours, but the app is more than just a calorie counter. It's very cool."
4446,4446,4,2015-09-17T23:51:32.000Z,LizMarLee,Pleasantly surprised.,The free version is actually really good without the extra perks of upgrading. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to have a healthier diet.
4447,4447,3,2015-10-19T15:31:39.000Z,Rowla1ee,Calorie counts are way off,I like the look and the ease of use of the app however the calorie counts and serving sizes are wrong on  a lot of items I've noticed. Won't be paying for the gold.

4449,4449,3,2016-02-12T03:38:08.000Z,Slax464,Add features,Make it so you can add a glass of water from the Notification Center so you could add a glass of water from the lock screen or anywhere without opening the app.
4450,4450,5,2008-09-04T01:07:59.000Z,kcharper,Helps me a lot,I love this. It has really helped me stay on track with my diet and exercise. Very much worth the price.
4451,4451,1,2016-12-23T14:48:22.000Z,Cpenelope,USE CAUTION,When you upgrade to premium (I paid for the 3 something a month for 12 months) it takes the money out for EVERY MONTH AT ONCE. I had christmas shopping to do that I can't do now cuz it took nearly 50 dollars out of my account saying $3 a month. They need to be honest about their charges. I'm pretty mad.
4452,4452,5,2016-12-29T04:28:35.000Z,CrissyLikeIce,Will Blow Your Mind!!!,"I weighed 185 pounds. When I started using this app I took a test that help me figure out the best way to lose weight. Now, I weigh 122 pounds!! 👍😁👏"

4454,4454,4,2017-02-23T23:28:44.000Z,Cape2tx,Great app but...,Maybe it's just me but I find it frustrating to calculate serving sizes. Too many entries available for the same food item.
4455,4455,3,2017-04-29T19:42:34.000Z,ALISH2000,Friend option is bad!,"Please help. Please fix this. Having a friend use the same app and help you is amazing, but it doesn't work. I sent invitations and she sent invitations, but it never works. Please help."

4457,4457,2,2017-07-11T16:59:20.000Z,woohoolulu,App won't open after update,The app won't open since it updated. I just started a new diet plan yesterday and am SO excited because lifesum is really helpful but it because much less effective if I can't open it!

It doesn't seem to be a problem to anyone else but it is debilitating for the chances of my using this app."

4469,4469,5,2016-09-29T13:40:29.000Z,Djdarling,I like the grade,One of the features of this app is that it grades your meal. Therefore it makes me work harder to get better grades.

If you want to have these things without paying, I recommend getting Fooducate and myfitnesspal. Don't waste your time with this stupid app."

Repeated emails to support with full details were ignored. This is a known issue per the FAQs. Do not upgrade to premium unless you want to pay for nothing. This needs to be addressed.

4595,4595,2,2015-12-12T03:17:01.000Z,Ldodge24,Lack of flexibility,"This app does not allow the user much flexibility in diet plan. It teaches users that potentially unsafe diets are normal or ever healthier than simply eating a diet of moderation in everything. Additionally, it restricts important health information like sodium and saturated fat intake to the paid subscription."

Could be extremely demotivational for someone with disordered eating or someone without nutrition knowledge to understand that Lifesum's food ratings don't reflect any actual science.

4687,4687,2,2015-09-10T19:17:10.000Z,Xxvgsggebhsytw,Options Lacking,Needs way more options! Not at all in any competition with mfp. Until it gets more options for food and exercise I can't use it.
4688,4688,4,2015-10-12T09:34:36.000Z,Lindsay 💕,Vegetarian,"I love this app, but I'm vegetarian and I'm not sure if I'm able to change that in settings. Most of my suggested meals right now include meat."
4689,4689,5,2016-01-29T02:28:45.000Z,Temper boy,Love this,I tweak the food sources until I hit the nutritional goals.  Then I eat it. 👍. Super easy and fun. Love this. Feel great too.

4700,4700,1,2012-08-16T15:59:00.000Z,HardRoc102,Misleading,"Says Runkeeper and Withings integration but does not mention that this is only with a Gold account which is not cheap at all. Definitely would be better as a paid app as opposed to ""free"" with most features locked behind a subscription wall."

To promote a diet where protein is only 25% of someone's diet is really unacceptable."

How about spending time updating the food log entry choices so we don't have to deal with garbage like ""1 one serving"" because of limited ""portion"" options.

4726,4726,1,2016-05-20T00:41:00.000Z,Etkdl,Need to pay to use most features,May as well find another app. This one won't let you sync with a fitness tracker unless you pay monthly. Can't get recipes unless you pay. Can't even get suggestions. Pointless.
4727,4727,5,2016-09-02T15:58:35.000Z,Buiiiiiiii,It is awesome,"I just love it, it has all the features I need to keep my health good"

4755,4755,1,2017-03-14T01:38:09.000Z,Whitt1991,Not happy,I downloaded the app and purchased the premium version for the diet plans. There are only a handful of recipes and no information about the plans. For $8 a month I would expect more. This is a complete waste of money.
4756,4756,1,2017-03-26T14:29:33.000Z,bbryno,Makes you pay for everything.,You are not able to try any of the features out without going premium. If you want to see if it works be prepared to fork out some cash.
4757,4757,2,2017-03-29T16:53:57.000Z,ChandiraG_2000,Essential feautures missing,You should gove the free users the ability to sync with 3rd party apps as well. Earlier you did that but now you've moved the feature to premium members.

4760,4760,5,2008-10-01T02:19:33.000Z,Kris223,This is a great app,"I really like this program.  The graphs give great feedback, and the diary is easy to use. The food database is great to get one started, but I like to use the labels and serving sizes from the food I'm actually buying in the store or restaurant (if the establishment has a nutritional chart otherwise I look up equivalents on the web for my entries).  These are easy to enter and once you have a few meal items (or meals as the food entries are easily defined either way) in the database it takes no time at all to do the diary.  The program works great and is very intuitive."

4791,4792,2,2015-09-15T03:34:11.000Z,mface,Impractical,Useless unless you bring measuring tools everywhere you go. Default serving sizes are completely impractical. Doesn't group together extremely common things like cereal and milk.
4792,4793,4,2015-10-18T21:47:23.000Z,Milo🌌,Easy,Simple to use. I need more reminders however
4793,4794,4,2015-11-02T22:06:54.000Z,duckfisney,Friends?,I just upgraded from a 5c to a 6s and my friends feature is gone?
4794,4795,1,2015-11-13T03:58:48.000Z,Hmgunter,Overall poor,Database is very sparse compared to my fitness pal. Seems impossible to add personal recipes. Quantity is very difficult to understand most times and the app is constantly telling me to drink water. I'm very sorry I subscribed it's been deleted!
4795,4796,4,2016-02-08T00:34:55.000Z,RaGeAfLiXeR,So far so good,If what I am having isn't exactly on there I just us the closest. I just started so I will see. So 2B continued!
4796,4797,5,2016-03-14T19:03:01.000Z,ColiRavioli,Amazing,Helps you stay healthy and consistent...I freaking love it
4797,4798,4,2016-04-20T04:17:03.000Z,Okayipad,Very helpful,It helps me pay more attention to what I eat and how I should eat.
4798,4799,3,2016-08-18T12:40:39.000Z,Megan_Mary,It's nice...,I'd buy the premium version if it was a little cheaper. Or have a trial so I can check it out before making a commitment.
4799,4800,1,2017-01-17T20:12:48.000Z,Hellcat66,Don't pay for it!,"I paid for 3 months to unlock the premium features... and they weren't even close to worth it. The ""Meal Plans"" were simply changing how many carbs vs protein vs fats you should eat in a day. You can do that with most apps for free!"
4800,4801,5,2013-09-26T02:01:10.000Z,Petiepab,Awesome app!,There are plenty out there but the ShapeUp app is the best! Easy to use & useful! Make it work for you!
4801,4802,3,2014-03-14T10:53:13.000Z,LordSethicus,"Terrific app, but needs to be cleaned up","It's a little buggy, it makes yesterday's info today's. Please fix that."
4802,4803,1,2014-05-30T10:29:00.000Z,TexasToon,Looks fun...,I was really looking forward to using this app but it fails to get past the registering screen.  Every time I try to register my birthdate actual or otherwise it sends me out of the app and back to my home screen.
4803,4804,1,2014-10-20T21:39:32.000Z,THEE MILLERS,features become locked without subscription,Was enjoying using this app for several days only to find all my food entries locked unless I start a subscription.
4804,4805,4,2014-11-12T00:51:48.000Z,Jackie1822,Helpful,"It helps me keep track of what I eat, especially restaurants"
4805,4806,5,2014-12-24T20:05:41.000Z,Aleks Misery,Love it,Easy to use and track!
4806,4807,4,2016-11-14T19:25:40.000Z,"Paid for, can't play",Best Cal Count App -- Crashes Too Much,You can customize so much. I love it. However.... it crashes way too much.
4807,4808,4,2017-01-26T08:49:26.000Z,Hallie_Sawyer,Great health app,"Love everything about the app so far, but I wish I could sync it with my Fitbit."
4808,4809,1,2017-03-01T18:44:03.000Z,Sarah2420,Not worth the money.,"I had upgraded so I could track a specialized diet and not sure some changes came with the latest update but now, I have to upgrade again to get any macros besides protein, carbs and fat. Ridiculous."
4809,4810,5,2017-07-14T22:29:31.000Z,m4pockets,Works for me!,Best weight loss app I've used to date.
4810,4811,1,2014-06-13T14:34:55.000Z,isaquec,Awful!!,"Worse app ever!! Can't believe I bought-shame on my blind faith. Data base of food is either none existent or wrong!!! Lots of work, not easy to use, glitchy. I will not recommend to anyone serious about tracking!!"
4811,4812,1,2014-11-19T13:01:02.000Z,vedtopkar,Don't make me laugh,"""If you're serious about changing your lifestyle you should go for gold..."" WHICH COSTS $7/MONTH."
4812,4813,5,2015-06-02T19:11:20.000Z,Tamv118,Amazing,Definitely the best health tracker out there. Worth the subscription!
4813,4814,3,2016-02-16T00:47:32.000Z,Jbarrera7787,Inaccurate,"Overall the app is decent but I feel like some stuff is off... For example, I'm not sure how ranch and thousand island get A/B ratings and balsamic vinaigrette gets an E..."
4814,4815,5,2016-05-18T03:09:07.000Z,Roya***,Lifeawesum,Great app. Helped me balance my calorie intake and helped me loose weight. Two thumbs up!
4815,4816,5,2016-10-08T06:11:29.000Z,NikkoRico,Problem,It's sscond day i sm filling dairy and it shows my yesterday mesls. I can't delet yesterday' s info.
4816,4817,1,2017-01-18T00:39:55.000Z,Tay warch,Premium Promo,I downloaded this app while looking on Pinterest at healthy recipes. I already have a calorie tracker app so I was like cool a place I ca get a bunch of healthy recipes but nope need to sign up for a premium account. For that it gets a delete and a one star. Sucky advertising.
4817,4818,5,2017-01-18T23:11:10.000Z,D@nny2002,Love it!,I love this app way more than the other blue one they have!

4820,4821,5,2015-07-25T14:07:09.000Z,giegie99,Essential,It helps me stay conscious of what I eat and my water intake.
4821,4822,1,2015-10-01T04:10:02.000Z,Kaybay1235421,Disappointed,"The app is so disintegrated. The Apple Watch does not sync with the phone. You cannot delete mistakes recorded after the sync decided to take place overnight. Emails registration complications and my favorite: non response from the developers! And yes, I paid!!!"
4822,4823,5,2016-02-02T00:34:01.000Z,Workhard9,Amazing,Fantastic motivator! Really help me get back on track of eating healthy
4823,4824,4,2016-03-21T03:30:18.000Z,Stephen Perteet,Easy,This is an easy app to use and keep track of you're day
4824,4825,1,2016-11-01T00:36:09.000Z,TheCraziestOfThemAll,Horrible bug,My calories burned goes up for every day every couple of seconds rendering all of the data useless. This didn't happen until the recent update
4825,4826,1,2016-12-02T03:39:19.000Z,Destiny-85,Great app but...,"I love everything about the app but, since the last update it closes after about 15 seconds after first opening it. I'm about to delete it because, at this point it's useless to me 😕"
4826,4827,3,2016-12-12T19:26:13.000Z,Ek12987354,New update isnt as good,"I dont like the new update from LIFESUM! Loved it before, now they dont have the ABCD foodcategories anymore, thats what makes it more complicated as easy for me!!!"
4827,4828,1,2016-12-27T03:05:43.000Z,Haha this is good,A dud,"Nothing syncs properly from the phone app to the Apple Watch app. The calories are incorrect compared to what was input from the phone. The water count doesn't sync, and it doesn't show the exercise like the phone app. It's a total dud."
4828,4829,5,2017-01-03T20:30:56.000Z,midcenmodmillie,Great app,"For what you get for free, this is an amazing app! Totally recommend it! Also sort of fun tbh.😛"
4829,4830,5,2017-01-13T23:04:59.000Z,Paige OBrien,Love this app!,"I've finally found an app that helps me, and motivates me!"

4831,4832,5,2014-12-29T13:49:55.000Z,JTmail,Awesome!,Helped me lose over 30 lbs. I recommend it to friends! I love it
4832,4833,1,2016-11-01T18:25:46.000Z,MoonChild98,Latest update extremely buggy,"Seeing other posts about latest update, calories burned and steps counted are increasing every time I sync, something is really wrong & needs fixing ASAP"
4833,4834,4,2017-01-02T21:15:55.000Z,Thaipenny,Cool App!,I'm enjoying the app so far! Only problem is the app will randomly close on me. Big fix please?
4834,4835,4,2017-01-28T01:42:03.000Z,Swan843,Lifesum Review,I really like Lifesum - it helps me to know what my goals are and then know what to eat to reach those goals.
4835,4836,5,2017-01-30T09:49:15.000Z,Alilililililililililn,Essential app,Love this app... not so much over the weekend but keeps me aware

4837,4838,1,2017-03-19T13:36:48.000Z,Salomeannes,Don't pay for this app,I upgraded to premium and it's the biggest waste of money. Won't sync with my Fitbit or my phone so it never tracks my activity and all around isn't user friendly.
4838,4839,5,2017-06-17T08:23:00.000Z,Rina.m,Loveee,Found it through Tammy Hembrow and I'm obsessed with it. It's super easy and helpful

4840,4841,5,2015-01-04T19:35:25.000Z,Swimgirlz200,Great.,Finaly something that made me eat less and be healthy.
4841,4842,5,2015-08-12T23:06:59.000Z,Fletchy Music,Get this app,I love this app!!! It makes calorie counting much easier
4842,4843,5,2015-08-27T16:51:30.000Z,Kylie alcazar,Amazing!,I love this app! It puts what I eat on a daily basis into perspective for a visual person like me.
4843,4844,2,2015-09-14T00:27:33.000Z,DARKPHOENIX!,Needs more food options,This app is great but most of the food I try to enter is not in the system. My fitness pal has almost everything on theirs
4844,4845,5,2015-09-14T23:17:01.000Z,Auntbal,Good for healthy lifestyle,Keeps me on track with my water intake
4845,4846,4,2015-10-13T17:38:16.000Z,Sharkfin58275,Good with Apple watch,Overall good calorie tracker with options for different types of diets.
4846,4847,1,2016-01-25T14:17:35.000Z,Carmel1965,Connection issues,Asks you to connect to the Internet while you are already connected. Restarting the app or the iPhone does not solve the problem.
4847,4848,4,2016-03-09T17:13:45.000Z,Bbalee,Great app!!!,I just joined and I'm already in love with it!!!  This is exactly what I need to monitor my food intake and count my movements per day!  Good one
4848,4849,3,2016-08-01T00:19:08.000Z,MaggieHughes23,Great interface but not very flexible,"If you offer ketogenic program, then you know how important net carbs is"

4850,4851,5,2013-12-11T13:23:06.000Z,Jmossinca,Perfect.,Much more than just a calories tracker ...
4851,4852,1,2014-05-30T01:27:29.000Z,Rollingstone805,Crashes during sign-up,How did this get featured on the App Store home page with such a glaring and annoying bug? This app sounds promising but needs a lot more under-the-hood work before it's ready for prime time.
4852,4853,1,2015-09-17T19:54:36.000Z,John haren,Not worth your time.,The app seems useful only to gold members (having to upgrade and pay for the app) there is little to no customization for the free membership. My Fitness Pal is 100 times better.
4853,4854,5,2016-05-23T23:05:24.000Z,Apollorion,Great app,Really got myself started on the track to a healthier lifestyle

4856,4857,1,2016-11-03T04:12:43.000Z,Lifsum,Ridiculous unrealistic increase in activity,"At the beginning it was working fine syncing...but after a couple of days, it started to go crazy! It said in one day that I hade taken 289,000 steps! And went 600 miles!"
4857,4858,4,2016-12-20T23:20:11.000Z,Haleighbuggaerey,Great app!!,I absolutely love the app. I'm actually a gold account. But some of the ratings are off. But I still love it!(:
4858,4859,1,2017-02-10T23:45:52.000Z,Frufrucakes,NOT HAPPY,"I've been using this app for over 2 months now but as I log my food, most of it is save incorrectly! For example: say I eat an onion ring... it says it's a healthy choice. This is saved by different people and is horrible"
4859,4860,2,2017-03-12T03:46:04.000Z,MersaJo,"Great, but it broke",I tried to auto-connect it to my health app but then it immediately closed the app. Now the app wont stat open no longer than a second.

4861,4862,4,2009-09-25T17:29:28.000Z,Dzzzxx,Great application,Developer: Why does the diary have a red X even though I am below the calories for the day?
4862,4863,4,2012-02-03T13:12:51.000Z,Marcel424,Its good,Like the favorites you can set up plus the stuff others contribute on meals.
4863,4864,1,2013-06-19T02:50:10.000Z,CaneZMD,Language changes?,> We've made several language translation changes to make sure every sentance makes sense.
4864,4865,2,2016-11-06T03:37:19.000Z,NerdyEnderman,New update duplicates activity calories,This is a real problem and needs to be fixed asap. It makes this app useless.
4865,4866,3,2017-01-20T21:02:33.000Z,Bobberssjdjdj,Lifesum,The app is pretty organized& easy to use. The exercise options are a little narrow but overall I love it

Hard boiled eggs and grapefruit might get a grade of D while cheeseburger might get a score of B. Does not help refine your diet at all. Just an aesthetically pleasing logging tool."

4900,4901,4,2008-08-04T03:53:46.000Z,Hoopin,Pretty sweet,Would be perfect if one could track points (alla weight watchers) as well as calories.  Great app nonetheless.

4933,4935,1,2015-10-20T16:21:52.000Z,القحطاني ,Not Impressive / sends spam!,This is a basically calorie counter app that wants you to pay for recipes and workouts.  Immediately after I joined I had spam in my inbox. Some from a company in Estonia.  Do not download this app.

4939,4941,1,2016-11-02T01:01:36.000Z,michellearnett,New update,The new update messed up my exercise tracker. My steps are being counted multiple times and my workout doesn't stay when I submit it. So my calories burned are wrong.
4940,4942,1,2008-09-30T01:06:53.000Z,Witinho,Ok but way too much work,"It takes a while to get started and is a little hard to use... I wanted an app that kept more track of workouts, not food. Way too much money too."
4941,4943,2,2011-07-28T04:24:53.000Z,Terry Franklin,Okay.,Not enough exercise choices. Wish there was a scanner for food labels. Website is down often.

4944,4946,5,2015-09-19T15:02:02.000Z,Juniebug06,More veg recipes,I generally like the app; the major lack is veg recipes for high protein diet.
4945,4947,4,2015-09-25T19:31:03.000Z,Just Call Me Jerry,Lovin it,I love the way you can sync all my iPhone data with the app

4955,4957,1,2017-05-01T06:31:42.000Z,Scmm09,Face first into a pay wall.,Everything except the calorie tracker is locked behind a pay wall. There are a ton of cool features that look helpful but it's useless if you don't cough up the cash.
4956,4958,1,2017-05-21T12:52:40.000Z,Bander908,Horrible,"I am 100lbs and it wont let me choose my goal! I want to be 90, but it say ""are you sure that's what you mean? Pick something else"" so then I do 91lbs then 92lbs then 93lbs then 94lbs then 95lbs then 96lbs then 97lbs then 98lbs then 99lbs and every time it says that😒"

4993,4996,1,2016-02-22T23:21:33.000Z,emilywantmoneyback!,You REALLY need an iPad version,The app you have currently is NOT an iPad app.  It forces one perspective (portrait)... Horrible since 98% of what you use an iPad for is landscape.  I don't honestly know why you would even suggest you have an iPad app.
4994,4997,1,2016-12-20T23:02:28.000Z,thenotebooker,Annoying,Latest update seems to have broken the syncing of the active calories with the Apple Watch.

It is SO motivating for me and I'm so thankful I found it, because it has helped completely transform my eating habits. The app itself is designed very well (love the graphics, colors, and animations). I really love the food diary, meal and day ratings, lifescore, the different food/water trackers, as well as the daily and meal-specific calorie tracker. The ratings are what really help me, because they guide me on what foods are best and not-so-good for my health and for my goals. The smileys are awesome. Lifesum even has a weight/body measurement tracker so you can see how many pounds you have lost/gained, as well as an exercise tracker so you can see how many calories you have burned, which is so helpful. I purchased the premium version pretty quickly after downloading, and while it is a little more than I'd like to pay yearly, it's definitely worth it in the long run for me personally."
5007,5011,1,2017-06-21T03:13:32.000Z,"7,/05",Only useful with subscription?,I was excited to try this app but sadly it seems like it's only useful with subscription. Bummer because I really liked the layout

5019,5024,1,2017-05-31T21:15:21.000Z,Raquel93dlr,Not actually free,This app's free price tag is inaccurate. You are required to pay to upgrade to premium if you actually want to use it. There isn't even a free trial to see if it's worth the money.

I can track my exercises, snacks, meals and know at any time, what calories I’ve consumed and how many more to my target.  I’ve been using it for 3 weeks and 1 day and I have officially lost 7 lbs."
5031,5039,1,2015-12-09T19:44:06.000Z,Petshot,New update cause for discontinued use,To assign a letter grade to each meal is incredibly defeating. You are doing more damage than good. Go back to the original format; it was better and honestly more accurate.

5133,5143,1,2016-05-18T00:22:22.000Z,JacobDude,Day Rating??,Did I miss the update where day ratings are only for paying customers?  Is this a glitch or an official change?
5134,5144,1,2016-09-21T17:11:31.000Z,Joe frankle,Free version is worthless,You have to pay to get any recommendations and the monthly fee (if you wanna try it out) is pricy. I'm not going to pay $8 for an app I might not like.

5142,5152,1,2015-02-10T14:48:33.000Z,Snicshake,Not much help if not the subscription version,This application is a bait and switch product. It doesn't even accept a negative weight gain for weight loss goal in its setup.

5360,5372,2,2009-06-21T17:16:57.000Z,Goody2211,"User updatable online database a good think, but a fiasco in practice; Cumbersome to add food/recipe","Tracks water. It does not track sodium although screen shots of the upcoming version suggest that sodium will be trackable. While you can enter total fat, you cannot break out the saturated fat or trans-fatty acid numbers. It covers the other major nutritional items and gives you the daily totals of each. Foods are in categories and that works most of the time. However, why are muffins under snacks and not under breads? You can edit just about everything, and there's a trash can where you can go and undelete an item you've deleted. I can add an exercise and edit it. I can ""edit"" a database exercise but the only thing I can change is the name. Can edit everything about custom foods as well as database foods. When I add a new food to the database, I can't enter the nutritional information by serving as it is listed on the food label -- I have to enter it based on 1 of whatever measurement I've chosen. While on the one hand this makes sense, on the other, I now have to have a calculator so I can convert the nutritional information from the food label serving size to 1 of my measurement. That's what computers are for -- I don't want to have to have a calculator on hand when I'm doing my data entry into the app. I could enter a recipe from a cookbook that already has the nutritional values as a custom food. However, if I'm cooking a recipe that does not already have the nutritional values I have to figure it all out manually before I enter it as a custom food in this application. When I add a food to my diary, one of the categories I can select is ""Brand Name"" but it's empty. When I search for a brand food, for example ""General Mills"" nothing is found, so I have to do an online search. I saved a cereal from my online search for ""Genera Mills""; *now* if I go to ""Brand Name"" category I see an entry. If I search for ""Cheerios"" on line, there are tons of entries for ""Cheerios"" -- all different (two different ""1 cup"" servings had totally different nutritional information) -- so I either have to sift through them all to find the accurate entry for my serving type or I have to create my own entry, which would then end up as still another ""Cheerios"" entry in the on line database, adding to the chaos. The on line database needs more brand foods and restaurant foods and once that's done, the on line database needs to be cleaned up. That would solve the problem of everyone making their own entries a la this ""Cheerios"" example. We cannot use this app right now because some of the nutritional items we need to track are not available. When the next version comes out and if tracking the additional nutrition items, cleanup of the online database, food entry with ""per serving"" data entry of nutritional values, and recipe entry with generating of nutritional values are added we'll be happy to use this app and will change the score."

There are some things I'd make a bit easier or change w/regards to adding my food intake and also to whatever data source the lifesum food library is based off - pretty sure it's only user created and not any info from a say, the nutritional facts published for a Starbucks drink on the actual Starbucks website... but it's fine I end up adding a new food or quick add the Val's myself so atleast that's always an option?"

What an excellent app,"I never write reviews, but this one is so good that I felt compelled to applaud the developers and company in general. Can’t believe how robust this app is and how simple it is to compile “meals” out of individual ingredients just by scanning a bard code, and saving them for use later. Beautiful UI and fluid and intuitive UX. Love the detail of verifying nutritional information with a little check mark next to each product as with most calorie tracking apps you’re given a slew of products and never know which one to choose from the search results."

5583,5597,3,2021-07-24T21:12:12.000Z,Erica Jenkins,Not Suitable for Vegans,"I wanted to start counting calories in order to lose weight. I saw that this app was highly suggested by a lot of doctors that I watch on YouTube. So, I gave it a shot. Spent money for the premium version and it’s not able to track my vegan food that I scan into it. Waste of money for me."
5584,5598,4,2021-07-11T15:20:03.000Z,krn20!,Not Bad,"Design of the app is good, but it should be more customizable to input my own measurements. The water log on the watch app is supposed to be easy, but it’s needlessly frustrating, making you choose between a full cup or a full bottle for one-touch input. You have go into the settings to change the amounts each time you want to log a different type. I assume this is because goals are set as cups/bottles per day, but people don’t always drink water out of the same size containers every time every day. I don’t know why I can’t just input by ounces. It’s also not possible to edit your intake via the app, so good luck if you don’t have a watch, and don’t have a 8.45oz cup or 16.91oz bottle. Most of my daily logs are inaccurate so the water feature is pretty irrelevant and needs a major overhaul."
5585,5599,4,2021-06-20T01:23:08.000Z,Soccer girl113,Review,Great app as far as calorie recommendations and healthy advice. I love the bar code scanner and it makes tracking a lot easier. The calories burnt during a workout seem a little high and it’s difficult to track restaurants
5586,5600,4,2021-05-28T15:18:05.000Z,mike hdhdjdkshshshd,Love the app but could use some tweaks,"I have been using Lifesum for exactly 347 days according to my ongoing streak. Everything works great for the most part other than some rare times the app doesn’t boot and my phone requires a restart to get it working. My main problem lies in the lack of sharing towards others who use the same app. For example, my sister made a different more low calorie lasagna but even after making the recipe and putting the steps on Lifesum, she couldn’t send it to me. I know there is a feature coming where you can share recipes with people, but if we could add to that and make a way to also friend other people, it would allow some cool features like looking at more creative recipes other people might’ve made, as well as ingredients people have favorited."

5589,5603,5,2021-04-16T22:51:10.000Z,Cmyoung01,Great app!,"This app is very easy to use. I am a person horrible with the conversation of the food that I am eating to oz, cup, pounds. This helps me to figure it out.  It's so cool to be able to scan the bar code on products right into my phone to get the nutritional value."
5590,5604,4,2021-03-23T19:14:48.000Z,AngelaElizondo252009,"Good, but needs some work","Great calorie counting app that has a bar code feature to make calorie counting super streamlined. I also like that is breaks down your meal into grams carbs, fat, and protein.  I don’t like how it rates food by smiley faces because it is not very accurate. I am not diabetic and using the classic diet plan, but it rates a medium apple as not a good snack food. I can tell you that an apple is a much better snack than chips, yet they get practically the same rating?? Other things that don’t make sense or could be changed: it adds your calories from exercise to the total number of calories you need to consume. In other words, the app wants you to eat as many calories as you burn???? The whole point of exercise to help you create a calorie deficit to lose weight. If you burn 600 calories working out and then go eat several slices of pizza you just defeated the whole point!!! Because of this the app always shows that I am consuming only 700-800 calories a day, but in reality I am consuming about 1300 a day and also exercising. I also don’t like that you cannot adjust your daily goal calorie intake— I would like to choose 1300, but the app is set at 1500, so I just watch the total number of calories consumed instead of looking at how many calories I have left. If you are total novice at portion control, healthy eating, and exercise this app could make it difficult to actually lose weight. I also don’t like that I have to manage my progress by weight unless I wantto purchase  the deluxe version. I don’t need meal prep plans, meal ideas, or all the other bells and whistles. I would like to track my weight by body measurements, which is a much more accurate approach since a person can gain and lose up to 4 lbs on average during a day in water weight alone. Also measuring by inches instead of lbs is less disheartening for the above mentioned reason. I just track this on a weakly basis on my own, but the stupid app asks me every morning to input my weight. Overall good for calorie tracking if you are mindful of the pitfalls."
5591,5605,4,2021-02-03T23:54:24.000Z,D4d0ch,Add more fasting options,I would like to add more fasting options. I do OMAD which is one large meal (1200-1400 calories) a day and 22 hours of fasting and weekends I eat like normal. You don’t have this as an option so I’m forced to go over my intake for the day when I’m fasting since it’s a 500 calorie limit. Please update this.
5592,5606,3,2021-03-23T18:27:46.000Z,OBTam,Good tracker poor synching with apple health,Most food that I buy at the supermarket is available to track in the app which makes the bar code scanner feature very practical. The process to add foods that aren’t recognized is pretty simple. Only thing is the app inconsistently syncs with apple health. Sometimes the calories match most times it doesn’t.
5593,5607,3,2021-03-17T23:57:17.000Z,MBPDR82,"Good for casual use, but not best",I tried Lifesum premium a few months ago and it was pretty good. I am not sure it is worth it to pay for the added nutrition facts and nutrition goals. If I’m doing the work to scan an items bar code (that I have in front of me) why wouldn’t the app show all the nutrition facts? MyFitnessPal pal is definitely the better app if you are not looking to pay a premium fee.
5594,5608,2,2021-03-10T16:47:40.000Z,LanaIsPretty,Limited control,"When I saw this was voted “best health app” I wanted to give it a try but it turned out to be so much less than I expected. The food tracker is so dumbed-down, it lacks the option to customize your entries in the most basic ways. For example, you tap a water glass icon to enter your water but you can’t adjust glass size- it’s 8oz or nothing. My glasses are 12oz pints. Yes, I can do the math but for a $49.99 app, I shouldn’t have to. It also doesn’t sync accurately with my Fitbit. Only a fraction of my steps show up in Lifesum- it seems to sync once early in the day but doesn’t update. I do like the look of the interface and the way it shows your macros- very easy to read & understand. Just overpriced for what it is- I have found it more frustrating than helpful so far!"
5595,5609,1,2021-03-01T18:02:56.000Z,Ninja 636 Girl,Discouraging,I wanted to start counting my calories so I started the day off with 400/535 calories I ate a snack to catch up on the missing calories it was TWO calories over and it criticized me for it. When I start planning lunch it tells me my snack was now 21 calories over I know for a fact that it said 525 calories before. Not to mention that you shouldn’t have to PAY to be healthy. That’s ridiculous. I’m incredibly disappointed and feel even more discouraged than before.

5597,5611,1,2021-01-14T21:09:06.000Z,malbu08,Doesn’t work as expected,"I initially was trying to download the Myfitnesspal app and this one popped up instead. I decided to purchase it after reading a few reviews, and I’ve only been using it for days now, but every time I open the app my calories that I have remaining change.It’s like it basically keeps syncing and un-syncing with my Fitbit so whenever I want to eat something and I open up the app to see what I have left Calorie wise, it shows negative because it’s no longer sync’d with my fitbit.

I tired weight watchers once and promptly became anorexic, which they praised me for.  The counting and tracking brings out the worst in me.  How low can I go?  When I got back some lab work that made it clear I had to watch my nutrition more closely and switch off the high protein diet I had been following (history of kidney disease in my family and routine blood work showed some early detection red flags) I started looking for a way to track my protein intake and maintain my sanity."

5605,5620,5,2020-09-02T04:19:27.000Z,Mrskiley03,Beautiful App but really buggy,"So the app itself accomplishes everything they were aiming for and even more. Helps you in every aspect you can account for when you’re trying to plan or follow a diet. But the major drawback is the app is bug-ridden. For instance, when you add food to a meal and leave the app and come back, that good is shown 2 times. Also if you remove one, you come back to see that the item is completely removed. Then the total calories will show 400 or some random number cals left even though you have had 1500/1500 cals."

The recipes are great but if you pay extra for the meal plans it’s a bit odd. Sometimes when you log the breakfast from the plan In the diary it says you are “off track”.  It’s a disconcerting way to start the day.  It would be great if you could enter and save your own recipes so that you don’t have to enter individual ingredients every time. The bar code photo is a very helpful feature. Overall it’s a  decent app but I’m not sure the meal plans are worth the extra money."

I am trying to get a lot of calories everyday. It recommends I have about 900-1100 calories for dinner but the highest calories dinners are only like 500-600 calories.

It didn’t bother me with the personal questions but they kept on saying stuff like ‘did you mean that’  or ‘your weight to low for BMI’. What irritated me the most is when the app said 12+ and I had to move it all the way up to 13.

However, when purchasing a subscription I was confused because I thought I had bought the one year subscription, for only $3.69/ month, but I was charged $47.80. I say this was confusing because these numbers were right next to each other and I thought I’d only get charged $3.69. This was extremely inconvenient and I think they should definitely clarify what you’re paying for and how much will be charged instead of just throwing both numbers out there."

I have been using it for 2 years (the free version) and recently upgraded to premium after trying other apps as well. I was very disappointed to see that there isn’t a complete nutrient distribution like Chronometer has (including individual amino acids in each food, etc.); it just shows you the nutrient breakdown as it appears on nutrition labels, which is not that useful to me. Additionally, it has a giant box that says “eat healthy, not hangry” at the top when you don’t meet your calorie goal, and this isn’t something I appreciate given current food shortages in stores from COVID-19. I also think saying I should eat “healthy, not hangry” because “my friends will appreciate it” misses the mark. I get that it’s a joke, but this food tracking app calling me a b*tch is not my favorite. Thanks tho."

The recipes use European names for food but I even enjoy looking them up because I am a word nerd🤓. The paid price is affordable as well at $29.99 for 6 months.  Looked at another vey popular weight loss app but too pricey for my budget. No downside.

I started making huge pots of veggie soups and eating that throughout the week but it wasn’t changing anything; if anything I was gaining MORE weight! So I figured it wouldn’t hurt to download this app and see what happens.
5631,5647,1,2020-02-19T14:29:05.000Z,Limited1,Never Works,"The app should be great. And if it actually functioned it would be. I get pretty angry at this point when I get prompted to spend money on this thing because I’ve had the basic app for ages now and every time I resolve to use it I’m reminded why I stopped before the day is even out. I can never even add all of my food to my daily intake because it just will not load anything for days at a time. Then it magically works for maybe 24 hours, and then asks me to pay for their subscription. I say no, and the app won’t load anything again. I don’t know if this is intentional but honestly it’s frustrating because I want to be able to use it, and I pay for other health and fitness apps, but this thing just never lives up to expectations. Editors choice my butt, I don’t believe all these 5 star reviews aren’t just fake with how shoddy this app actually works."

I actually came across this all from a YouTube sponsorship from YouTuber Morgan Adams and I decided to give it a try. I got a decent discount on the premium and went for a weight loss diet plan.

Weird, I just downloaded the app in 2 seconds without issue. So okay maybe my connection. Then I go to set up my weight, etc and the screen keeps popping up the text bar when I need to click the next button. I never get that done. So I find a different location to enter my info, different formatting so I assume it’s going to work. Nope! So I delete the app and redownload it. Same problems!

My only problem is the lack of fine tuning for your personal goals. For example I’m following the 5:2 diet plan and for the 5 days that I’m not fasting during the week I’m expected to eat close to 3500 calories a day? That’s absurd considering I put in the same information (height, weight, etc.) on a separate website and I was told I needed to take in at the most 1700-2300 calories a day depending on how active I am during the day, to lose weight. The math doesn’t add up and it’s kind of frustrating to have the app telling me I’m failing at meeting my daily goals outside of my 2 fasting days. I suggest a future update that allows members to pick their diet plan and then be able to fine tune it to their individual needs. Other than that it’s an outstanding app that’s been really keeping me committed to eating healthier!"

It really was for about a month then I got a new phone and re-downloaded the app. Suddenly, not only was was I no longer able to connect to my premium membership, the app said my account no longer existed at all. So logically, I went down the “reset username” and “reset password” routes multiples times each, but the emails never arrived. I’ve given up on the app. Biggest waste of money I have ever spent. The app was great until that, so beware they just steal your money then act like your account never even existed and ask you to sign up for premium all over again."

The app had me eating way more calories (1600 if I was not active and 2000+ if I had an active day) than any other food tracking app I’ve used. Other apps I have tried such as My Fitness Pal and Lose It! would have me only eating 1350-1600 a day (I am a relatively small person so these numbers make more sense for me.) I thought the app was very visually appealing and I saw a lot of positive reviews, so I trusted LifeSum over the other two apps when it came to the calorie goal it set for me. It was obviously way too high."

I purchased it because of all of the great reviews and feel taken advantage of now that I have the app. Go with a cheap food tracking app and get recipes on Pinterest.

There is not an option for me to select my ideal weight. Maybe this gets fixed and I will be able to use the app. Anyone else have trouble on iOS

You can only change the units and the amount of “8.45fl.oz” cups of water you drink. My cup is 8fl.oz, so when i input my data, its inaccurate.. This is same with other foods and drinks.

I know it’s healthy to do so, but I’d rather it allow me to lose weight faster by limiting my calories a lot more. Other research has shown me that it’s perfectly reasonable to eat less than the 1600 calories LifeSum believes I should eat to “lose” weight as fast as it will let me. I end up gaining weight instead even if it’s perfectly clean eating because that’s A LOT of food. Sometimes I’m sedentary so I logged my lifestyle in to fit a diet for that, but 1600 is impossibly high for my low metabolism to keep up with & I start to feel bigger and bigger & the scale reflects that. I do want to be more active, but that has nothing to do with the app so any progress I make that way is now help from LifeSum. Many other approved sites suggested I subtract 500 calories a day from my regular intake (about 1600 more or less) to lose 1 lb (3500 cal) a week. And then raise my cal intake back up to 1300-1400 to maintain my weight once I reach my goal. So if I don’t BURN 500 extra cal per day while eating 1600 cal, I’ll never see progress, and I may actually see worse. It’s annoying that it will not let me lower the counter one bit. 1600 cal is hardly a weight loss diet for anyone! It’s just about normal for maintaining for most people (especially sedentary) & easily well fit for GAINING for sedentary or less active people in general."

If you’re looking for any sort of accuracy in the recorded nutritional content, you're best using a different app like My Fitness Plan, Senza, etc. So utterly disappointed that nearly every barcode scanned calculates the wrong information. I can accept some errors here and there since the data could be user submitted, but holy hell, how many things could be so far from what the nutritional content is for mainstream products like Fage yogurt cups. 17 carbs in 5 ounces of yogurt?

For several weeks I used the Ketogenic Strict diet plan and then tried out several other plans in the app. After a few months I fell off the plan. I never deleted the app but did log out. I am now attempting a lifestyle change again and logged in to my account using the email I originally purchased my membership under. The app now tells me I need to resubscribe to premium and am only on a free access account. On the free account you can’t use the Keto diet plans. I should not have to resubscribe when I already purchased a subscription that has 2 more active months. This app stole money from me by changing my account status without my consent. I do not recommend this app due to this shady practice. No telling how many thousands of other people have had this happen to them without realizing it."

I’ve literally downloaded 8 different apps developed for the purpose of losing weight and/or living a healthy lifestyle. I downloaded and learned this one, sadly, last. It’s so straight forward. I just wanted a little push to help keep me on my goals. And I’ve seen the competing apps, some I didn’t even understand what they were asking for me to input. This one has everything I need, in a comprehensive and straight forward layout. It’s detailed but simplistic. I think the only way I could do better is if I hire an actual nutritionist and personal trainer to follow me around everywhere, and goodness knows I’m not doing that. Thanks for the great and easy to use app!"

When I selected this premium package, willing to pay that amount a month for their services and if I ever decided I didn’t want to use the app anymore I could just cancel the subscription, right? Well when I selected this package and allowed it to charge my card, the total said $47.51. At this point it had already processed through and the only thing I could do was cancel the subscription, which I did immediately. I also immediately contacted the app support and informed them of the situation. I didn’t hear anything back from them, and the next day I got a receipt from apple saying the charge went through. I contacted them as well and only received an automated message back saying they could do nothing about it. I now am dealing with overdraft charges and can’t get through to a single person about the situation. Leading people to believe they are going to pay minimal prices and then charging $50 is completely ridiculous. And anyone who thinks paying that amount for an app that simply calculates your food intake is insane. Worst app experience ever."

But for water intake, please, please, please give an option to set the amount of water per cup. I drink from only a 24 oz water bottle and I can’t customize the amounts. The only options are 8.45 and 16.91. It makes accurate tracking really difficult."

5684,5705,1,2019-01-15T14:57:05.000Z,a.red8,Unhappy with customer service,This app is advertised as being a certain price per month so I purchased the one advertised as being $3.99 a month for a 12 month subscription which would be $44.99 for the year. I expected that I would be charged monthly as it was advertised but when I received an email with my bill I was charged the full $44.99. I reached out via email to ask about this and get a refund and the company responded that I must get permission from Apple iTunes to get this refund. So now I have to jump through hoops to get my money back and what is their response when I ask why it is advertised that way instead of “I’m sorry” or “how else can we help?”?? That I should have read the purchase before subscribing. Now that is just sneaky. Do NOT advertise your company as being a monthly payment then charge people the full amount. I’m sure it was written somewhere in tiny font that no one can even read. That is just bad customer service too. I am very disappointed with this company and how they handled this.

I do wish the smiley or “meh” faces were optional to remove from the diary and that it would split the difference in calories between meals for the day as the android version did. As in, not telling me I’m 100 calories over for my lunch meal when I had 15 calories for breakfast. I still give it 4 stars because it does truly help me stay on track either way, I just hope future updates will help it match up with the android version."

You need to do a way better job of keeping it cleaned up. Users beware - make sure you double check everything or use the bar code scanner most of the time.
5688,5709,3,2019-02-14T16:55:22.000Z,weathergal08,Inaccurate,"I’ve only had the app for 8 days. I really liked the idea of the app and the layout. I even got my boyfriend to download it because he was curious about it. After a week of tracking our food, water intake and steps. We realized that it was inaccurate on certain items. For instance large sonic fries said it has 57000 calories but when we looked it up on the app because we thought that seemed high it says only 470 Calories. Also I dislike the fact that I can’t customize the meals I make and it gives me options for meals in restaurants that I’ve never heard of because we don’t have them in the south. As well as the water intake. It only gives you options for 8.45 & 16.91 fl oz. The cup I use is a 32 oz. I feel like there are a few things that need to be fixed if they’re going to charge for a subscription."

I love the setup, the meal ratings, the tips & the ease of use but I’ve found that SO MANY food nutrients are incorrect, even when scanned. For example: International Delight Sugar free Coffee Creamer is labeled on the bottle as <1 carb per tablespoon. When scanned it says 0 everything & even when I go in to manually edit the food for correct information it changes back to the original incorrect information. I was trusting the info in the app when scanned & thought wow I can have more than I thought. Come to find out my few cups of coffee with cream that I thought was no carbs was actually 9g of carbs! That’s half a days worth of carbs in 3 cups of coffee 😳 also Ground Cinnamon says you are -2.5 per teaspoon; also incorrect. I scanned the label & got so excited that I was negative carbs! Wrong again. I had to go out of my way to find the correct nutrients online & come to find out it actually was adding carbs. Too late though, cause I had already ate the food. I feel that paying $49.99 for a yearly subscription is extreme when I have to go out of my way to research anyway to ensure what is in your system is correct. I really loved this app until I found out that information on things I’ve been eating was wrong. Now I’m questioning if I’ve even been in ketosis at all because who knows now what my carb intake, fats, & proteins really were for all the times I just scanned & trusted your system. Also with the exercises, there are so many standard ones that aren’t even listed. I’m just really disappointed."

Shared it with a table of friends at dinner who couldn’t stop asking me questions about the app and my results. I chose the Keto Strict, and will move to Keto Moderate when I’m ready however there are many great options with inspiring meal plans, Mediterranean, etc.   I never knew how sated I could feel. Ever. The app showed me how much fat, carbs and protein it wanted me to have at any given meal for my “daily diary,” and even made adjustments to allow me more food after exercising. This makes me want to buy myself more calories and fat just by exercising—again and again. The app made me feel good about not following it perfectly. (Since when was guilt never part of dieting?) anyhoo, I love the reminders and alerts. Know that Keto is not the “high protein low carb” and this app has made all the difference in my education on the issue. I have found that Healthy fat is King and is probably the vital nutrient missing in most people’s diets these days. ...Never knew how much fat one could/should have in a day on a Keto strict diet. Freaking amazing! Once I got up to par on my daily intake needs, the rest was a piece of cake, without the temptation!"

I like that it tells what is good and bad in food choices, and that it reminds me to eat fruit and fish. I paid for the premium, to get the most out of the app, but these are some things I would like to see: 1) I can edit my macros to my ideal goals. Right now my goal is kinda in the middle of being healthier/cutting fat and gaining muscle. I’m skinny, a tad muscular but have some fat to lose. My macros I like to aim are 30-50/30-40/20. 2) more choices/variety for the “how much”. It’s pretty difficult to exactly see how much I eat or drink but how I would measure it isn’t on the list so it’s difficult to track on the app. 3) recommendations for food products. If it’s saying the slice of bread I’m eating is high in sodium and is processed, show me breads that would be better choices."

I wasted $30.00 trying to get it to do the protein diet accurately and the way it’s supposed to be done. Canceled it but no refund."
5709,5733,3,2018-03-06T17:45:14.000Z,Ugvicmk,Needs net carbs calculation,"Pretty good app. Recipes are great. What is seriously lacking for Keto diets is the calculation of net carbs. For a day that is limited to 20g carbs, the app calculates based on carbs and not net carbs (g carbs - g fiber), so you have to manually calculate how many carbs you have left and be “out of sync” with the apps recommendations. The food nutrient database and accuracy of bar code scanning also needs expansion and improvement."

But I don’t know why every time I add an item and put in the calorie number that the app retaliates it as a way way higher number than it is. Today I only ate about 748 calories but it’s showing me that I consumed 16708 calories.

Literally even SCANNING the food’s bar code produces incorrect data,and there’s so way to change or update it, which is incredibly frustrating."
5714,5738,3,2018-04-24T02:22:04.000Z,Moet101,It’s a pretty good app,"This app is laid out pretty well, it takes the guess work out of hitting macros and has a pretty large list of single food items in its data base."
5715,5739,2,2018-04-25T22:37:36.000Z,Vivland,Ripped off,Downloaded this and decided to go for the premium. Said it would be a monthly charge.  Nope they charge the whole $ 44.99. Wouldn’t have got it if I had known.
5716,5740,5,2018-05-09T16:53:40.000Z,CianosWay,Highly Recommend,"I never write reviews for apps, but this one is an exception. I’ve been going to the gym a lot lately and wanted to start to balance out my food calories and burned calories. I downloaded LifeSum and MyFitnessPal just to see which one helped me better - LifeSum exceeded my expectations by a long shot. The layout is aesthetically pleasing and super easy to use. To be fair, it might take some time to get a hang of logging certain things, but I keep finding new features and I love it! As a rule I never buy premium versions of apps (with the exception of Spotify) but I bought the premium version of LifeSum and I don’t regret a penny of it. This has helped me out so much - I highly recommend the Clean Eating Plan, or the Keto Easy Plan (even if you aren’t keto — I’m not, but I am trying to cut down on carbs and Keto Easy helps so much). I love this app"
5717,5741,3,2018-05-15T16:25:59.000Z,Caaaaarliiiita,Premium Pricing.,"The app is great in itself, but in order to make it more accessible and reasonable, instead of charging the full price for a subscription to Lifesum premium at once (i.e. $44.99), simply just charge the basic price ($3.75/month). It’d be more preferable to make recurring payments of that small amount and be able to cancel your subscription at any time, rather than cancelling your subscription and losing an entire $45 for an app."

This app allowed me to be mindful of my food and exercise habits. I’ve simply done calories in calories out."

The daily diary format matches your day, but more importantly you can choose any measuring system or unit. Try it for 1 or 2 days and you will see what I mean. ;-)"
5721,5747,4,2017-09-11T12:39:30.000Z,Faranga25,Great Way to Keep in Shape!,"This app is great. It helps you to monitor what you eat and drink on a daily basis. You also can input your weight goals and what type of nutrition plan will best fit you. The only thing is if you want to see some of the meal plan ideas, you have to upgrade to premium which is like $24.99 for the year... which isn't bad !"

When I first started this app it was great......as of the September 27th update, all of my history is gone and when I type in my meals the options that come up for names of foods and company's are vague, very few options. I DON'T LIKE THE UPDATE! I was going to upgrade to the premium version.....not now......$44.99 for 12 months is too much for a bunch of recipes I probably won't use."

The user interface is awkward.  Features are not logically arranged to make entering data convenient.  The bar code scanner does not work most of the time.  The developers leave it to the user to enter food and create their data base so you see the same food entered 20 different ways.  The button layout should walk the user through the process of using the App. Instead you spend a LOT of time back tracking.  It’s a total mess...but hey, it’s free. You get what you pay for!"

Oh and then they have it advertised in the App Store as $29.99, but they only give you the discount if you go from the App Store and buy the subscription there. Super screwed up way to do business."

I just the iPhone the end of December and the app was working fine until now. When I click on the app it’ll stay open for a good 5 seconds then shuts off. I turned my phone off tried it again, didn’t worn, deleted then redownloaded and it’s still acting up. I love the app but that’s getting on my nerves."
5727,5753,4,2018-02-22T16:22:29.000Z,MR1958,New user... impressed so far,"I decided to try this app since it “integrates” with the Apple Health App which my previous food tracker did not. I like the bar code scanner feature and the GUI is growing on me. The customer service is top notch, I had a concern and they messaged me to educate me on how to use the feature I couldn’t find."
5728,5754,5,2018-03-06T05:04:28.000Z,Conypaz,Wanna give it a 4.999999,So I looked into every nutrition tracking app Apple’s Health app collabs with and actually tested 4 of them out. This one is hands down the easiest to use and has the most appealing design/graphics/animation.

Se da ipad aggiungo cosa ho mangiato, sull'iphone mi trovo i cibi inseriti nel pasto del giorno successivo rispetto a quello inserito su iPad. Inoltre le attività importate da moves sono incomplete. Se anche si va nelle impostazioni e si clicca su 'sincronizzazione' non tutte le attività sono importate. L'app comunque ha tanto potenziale (utente con account gold)"

Most of the functions now require you to buy a ShapeUp Club Gold monthly subscription account or go to their website for their ""online food database, containing 400,000+ foods."" Umm, I think that defeats the purpose of buying an ""app"". If I wanted to go to my computer & browse the web, why would I pay you a subscription to be limited to just you site?...because it syncs to your app?

5792,5818,3,2011-01-04T18:25:12.000Z,Bri_something,Basic but very helpful. (pre-update),"I am happy with this app. Not thrilled but happy. It's helped me lose 5 pounds in 4 days (since beginning my New Year's Resolution) but that is a testament to counting calories in general. I enjoy very low-cal crash diets and this app doesn't hassle you about not eating enough like others do so that's a plus. I often have to enter my ready-meals myself as this app doesn't have as many entries (brands and varieties) in its database as I would like. It doesn't do anything special but definitely serves its purpose and was free when I uploaded it. However, I am reading the newest reviews and see that it is no longer a free service as of the update. Some have mentioned a recurring membership fee?!? I'm sorry you guys were duped but I thank you so much for warning me before I updated this app. I do like this app but it is not worth paying for. Sorry. If you folks are willing to pay, I'd recommend the Calorie Counter Pro by MyNetDiary which is much more comprehensive and user-friendly. No recurring membership fees, just $2.99 up front and worth every penny. I was unable to transfer that app to my new iPhone4 because my MacBook operating system is antiquated so I tried this app instead. I will continue to use this for as long as I can without updating but I would not pay for it. It just isn't worth the money. Especially since I have no interest in joining their club. I just want to log the calories I eat and burn and there are other apps that make doing so simpler and more fun."
5793,5819,5,2011-01-05T19:32:00.000Z,Amyn119,Calm down people,"I updated this app to v3.3.1. My backup data is still saved within my iphone. You only need to sign up for the account and get the Gold feature for 3 months such as complete sync etc. After gold expire, you'll status is just back to free account like before, and you still can use this app for its core feature. The free account is only lack feature of complete sync(etc.?), and you can only backup your data for last 1 month(maybe?), the data older than that will be deleted. I still love this app."

I generally get tired of entering everything I eat individually and wish the database had more commercial items, like common restaurant items at major chains. Even if the exact item I ate wasn't in there, I could more easily find a substitute. It's a good program overall and for the price I think it's a great deal."

The two searches I did--eggos and Illy--were found immediately by the MFP app, but this one required the qualifier ""waffles"" to be appended to ""eggos"" and only found ""Illy"" as parts of other words (e.g., Philly). You've got the form nailed--make the function match it, and you'll have a 5-star app."
5800,5826,5,2010-12-11T19:13:28.000Z,An_lib,Great app!!!!,I lost 4 kilos since October) it's very useful)) now I just can't live without this great app! Thanx)
5801,5827,4,2010-12-11T20:59:02.000Z,Livy Lou 42,Overall good app.,"I like the app. However, I think there should be away to manually write your own fat, protein, and carbs in as a custom meal. It will allow you custom calories, but why not further that and also allow the fat, protein, and carbs which should then auto calculate the calories. There are times when there are unique foods you cannot search for, and would be easier just to estimate the fat, protein, and carb grams manually. If you could do that, I would give it 5 stars."
5802,5828,5,2010-12-13T15:50:17.000Z,Ej_lookin_boy,Wonderful management tool,"I like counting calories instead of points (too complicated). This is easy to use, has an extensive food database plus you can add your own favorites and custom meals. I've tried other apps but keep coming back to this one for its simplicity."
5803,5829,4,2010-12-14T00:34:10.000Z,Marie8171673,Good program,"This is a good program for different weight loss Programs since it easily tracks protein, carbs and fat along with calories on the home screen.  Lots of settings for goal planning and like yhat you can go online on pc or Mac and print stats out for a week or month, etc.  Food database isn't as robust as others I've used, but still good.  Highly recommend for low carb dieters."
5804,5830,4,2010-12-30T04:18:23.000Z,Lexi 👱🏾‍♀️🎀,Mommy,Like the program very much.
5805,5831,5,2010-12-30T17:57:41.000Z,Khalid Mehmood Butt,Love it!,This is a great app.  It would be even better if you could add a way to track exercise over time and show the carb/fat/protein breakdown for specific foods.
5806,5832,2,2017-08-26T03:45:49.000Z,lookin_for_the_best_band_09,Better tracking apps out there,Other food apps have been better and provided more info free. And there are constant bombardments to upgrade--to the point where I'm going to accidentally hit the button and have my card charged $34.00. Changing back after my trip I need tracking for. Does trap exercise and food. My fitness pal is better and provides more info.
5807,5833,2,2017-08-29T18:20:42.000Z,maralove22,Has potential but free version is horrible.,This app looks good and is more fun than a normal diet tracker. I had awesome features like life scores.
5808,5834,4,2017-09-05T17:47:29.000Z,Lopa72,Needs Widget,I really love the features of the Lifesum app. I only wish we had a widget for iPhone like the one that is on Android (I have both types of devices.) It would be nice to have the shortcut to add water and food.
5809,5835,1,2017-05-29T21:57:52.000Z,SDMFdisciple,It won't let me make an account,"So I can sign up, neither can my spouse. Say we have spaces in the username and that is NOT the case."
5810,5836,5,2017-05-31T18:02:33.000Z,Janxjcj,best app for counting macros!,i just started learning about Macros a few days ago and i searched everywhere looking for a decent app to help me keep track of the macros i eat and couldn't find anything. luckily i stumbled across a youtube video where a woman raved about this app! i totally agree with her. the app is so helpful and sleek. love it.
5811,5837,5,2017-06-03T17:28:07.000Z,Zoem5679,Using for ketosis,"Great UX. Wish we could modify macros for ketogenic plans (to 75/20/5) without it making you switch to a generic plan. The keto tips are helpful but following the Hopkins ratios can be tough for ""civilian"" use. Also wish net carbs are the carb counting."
5812,5838,5,2017-06-15T18:48:14.000Z,🐶🍗🐻,My honest opinion,This App is great and on the rare occasion it isn't.
5813,5839,4,2017-06-15T19:12:02.000Z,SavageSD,"Great app, but","Very useful for weight loss or gain efforts, but since I'm also trying to monitor my water intake I'm frustrated by the fact that the container sizes are fixed. I don't own any glasses or water bottles that hold exactly 8.45 or 16.91 fluid oz. and try to avoid mental math where I can, so for now I'm using a seperate app to log my water intake."
5814,5840,2,2017-06-29T14:41:11.000Z,madhatter1605,"Better, but premium is not worth it","I am a premium member. Aesthetically, this app is leaps and bounds better than MyFitnessPal. However, it's extremely biased towards on the calories-in-calories-out paradigm. There are very few customization options for paying members. For instance, there is no way to easily view net carbs, and viewing the carb breakdown takes several clicks. The weekly graphs dont display much more than your caloric intake, which is frustrating if you are trying to figure out how you did on your macros. There's some weekly test that a)doesn't work most of the time and then b)grades your responses by some pop culture nutrition nonsense. There is also an annoying emoji that reprimands at ever.single.meal if you for not adhering to the standard American diet. Most of the navigation options are useless. Why are plans so incredibly persistent? I don't need to see that all the time after I've picked a plan. Strangely, low carb and keto plans are listed, but they lack any customization options. You're stuck with whatever white girl nonesense the app has decided is good for you."
5815,5841,5,2017-08-01T03:26:06.000Z,JaxieDdd,just started using,very useful and i love the bar code scan!
5816,5842,1,2017-08-07T23:33:59.000Z,Caligurl1382,Seems to be ok,"I have struggled with my weight all my life. Got up to 410lbs. Trying to loose weight has really taught me something. It is cheaper to be fat than to loose weight. This app proves that. $44 a year. Every app cost a fortune. Add to that the cost of eating healthy, which is much more expensive than eating junk food. No wonder so many people die fat. Waiting for the day when it is cheaper to eat healthy and to loose weight. Until then, guess I need to look for another app to help me.Edit: Fitbit sync fir free would really be nice. But your response shows you have no desire to help, only make money."
5817,5843,2,2017-08-10T04:08:25.000Z,Cjlrx,"Okay, but paid version is a no","Downloaded this because I heard good things but upon downloading it, it wants me to upgrade to Premium just to sync this with my Fitbit app. I don't really see a point in having to input exercise when I already have a tracker. I thought ""whatever, I'll buy the premium version"" because like I said, I had heard good things AND because the little upgrade screen says ""$3.75/month""."
5818,5844,4,2017-08-22T02:24:55.000Z,Rarararareavdjjdbsgsj,Almost perfect but great!,The app has been crashing recently and the share a meal function isn't working at all. I send it to my boyfriend because we cooked it together and he gets the link it opens his app and then nothing. The meal I shared is no where to be found.
5819,5845,5,2017-03-15T18:15:54.000Z,Stevemezz,Best app ever used!,I have used my fitness pal for about a year now and I was watching Rachel Austs YouTube the other day when she mentioned this app. I decided to give it a try because honestly MyFitnessPal stresses me out. I ended up falling IN LOVE with this app and the design of it. It's so clean and user friendly. Going to recommend it to EVERYONE! ❤️
5820,5846,5,2017-03-23T11:18:32.000Z,"Fahrenheit, Celsius, ... you know the rest",LOVE Lifesum,Purchased the yearly pass one month ago and have loved having one location to manage my weight loss. Diary with the bar code scan so easy to use. Haven't spent a great deal of time in the recipes but would love to dive further into those in the near future.
5821,5847,2,2017-03-25T18:57:46.000Z,Mitchellteam5,Would be awesome if I could use it.,I had this on my android phone and loved it with no issues. Now I've got an iPhone 6 and the app only stays on about 10 seconds at a time and shuts itself down.
5822,5848,3,2017-03-31T10:20:12.000Z,CreemCheez226,"Awesome, but could be better!",Hey!
5823,5849,5,2017-04-03T16:06:45.000Z,03sarah87,"Love it, can only get better","Invested in myself with the premium version and use it on both my android and iPhone. Slightly different interfaces but both good. Some nutrition macros are off, but I don't mind correcting them. I Iike how I can add recipes, and the ketogenic ""fat burner extreme"" meal plan tool offers exactly the kind of tracking I was looking for. After years of different eating plans, this app has been a tool that helps me stay on track, its day 12 and I'm 8 lbs down in ketosis. I like the graphics and feel of this app more than others. A desktop version would be great for rapid entries, but I'll still use this without it."
5824,5850,5,2017-04-09T18:00:13.000Z,B_LAG_O,I'm here because of Monica Church,I saw it in her YouTube video and was interested in trying it out !
5825,5851,5,2017-04-26T03:47:22.000Z,Wolfgang Amadeus Beethoven,Amazing,Really good features. I found out about this app threw my favorite YouTube channel. Bramty Juliette. I love this.
5826,5852,5,2017-05-02T03:44:08.000Z,Ig: @shanell.eshe,I Definitely recommend this app to people tying improve their lives.,This is a great app if you are trying to lose gain weight or maintain a good lifestyle.it helps keep you trying and keeping up on your goals you set .

5828,5854,2,2017-05-26T03:55:36.000Z,Memeelyn,2 Stars,I used to love this app but now that there constantly asking me to get there premium version I'm starting to not like it before they came out with it you could look at any recipes you wanted but now they made premium you can't it's not that special if you can tell they just want money. I need a diet and they're trying to make me pay for it ugh no. And I barely have any storage and I don't want to get a new app unless it's worth it and doesn't make the people who have premium the only privileged ones so if anyone can recommend/Suggest something for me I'd be so happy and I suggest you not waste storage on this unless your looking forward to paying $5 per month or $29.99 p.s I was gonna rate 3 star but I decided to do 2 cause this made me rethink my options

5832,5858,4,2017-02-06T17:33:14.000Z,ImYourDoom,Great App,Similar to the MyFitness Pal app. Sends notifications if you prefer. Enables you to log your food/water intake. Has the bar code scan feature to make logging simple. It has different meal plans for you to follow.
5833,5859,5,2017-02-06T17:50:29.000Z,xXxAndyxXx,Great.simple.easy,It is totally easy to use and motivating in itself. Keeps you logged and healthy.

It is fast to add food to your diary and easy to make improvements to your diet by keeping track. It is missing a few features and could be improved but it serves its purpose."
5835,5861,2,2017-02-22T16:50:00.000Z,The Magno Collection,"Still searching for a single, smart app","Out of the nutrition apps I've tried this one is the most visually pleasing and easy to use.  However the simplicity overlooks features and makes this app unappealing to me.  I just bought myself and Apple Watch and want a system that is fully integrated without redundancies, but Lifesum comes up short in its integration."

5837,5863,4,2017-03-04T00:39:10.000Z,Cindy VAC,Pretty good,I used to use MyFitnessPal but I heard about this app on YouTube. The only issue I found is that you can't manually add food or exercise that isn't in the app data base
5838,5864,5,2017-03-08T20:42:21.000Z,KAYG08,Love this app 🍗🍗🍗,I love this app because i can mark everything I did like exercise and foods
5839,5865,4,2016-01-26T01:28:04.000Z,Andresitoo90,The Best,Savage App. Very useful.Price should be lower or great updates should be made frequently.
5840,5866,4,2016-02-15T07:40:17.000Z,Patrick smart,With every new update this app gets less stable,Now i have to close the app in order to see the foods that i've add.Updates are meant to fix bugs not to add more of them.
5841,5867,1,2016-05-30T17:58:04.000Z,Peabody42,"Well, it's a good try.","They layout and interface are beautiful, gave me hope for over all experience. But even with an upgraded plan I still wasn't able to adjust my macros, I was just given three choices. I like being able to set my own protein/fat/carb instead of having to choose what they give me and then having to figure it out on my own. The app also has a very limited database of food with the bar code scanner. It also does not sink with Fitbit/garmin. Also, some food is WAY off. For instance it told me that 4 large eggs had 135 carbs. Ummmm...escuse me? I didn't eat Cadbury eggs, just regular 'ol chicken eggs. That was more carbs than I was supposed to eat for the day. Since I KNEW that was WAY off it made me wonder about the rest of the food."
5842,5868,1,2016-06-08T12:47:32.000Z,shagunster,Don't pay to upgrade!!!,It's not worth the money to upgrade. I also misunderstood the subscription terms and paid for 3 months and thought it would be paid per month and not all at once for $21.99. Big mistake. The recipes are very limited and that's pretty much all your paying for. Definite waste.
