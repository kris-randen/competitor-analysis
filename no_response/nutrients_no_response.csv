Makes it easy to track food quantities. Some people have complained that it doesn’t  show summary totals in grams, just percentages—but you can just go to the apple health app to see that over time, which is really great. I wouldn’t change the interface on this app. Wish the health app could also display the DV you set in this app for comparison on those charts."
1,1,4,2020-11-13T22:02:35.000Z,mnh16,A few problems,"I didn’t see a tutorial, which I could really use. I find it frustrating that when I want to create a recipe, there are often only brand name versions of ingredients that should just be raw. Since I am not sure what the brands represent nutritionally, this seems odd. I made a sweet potato soup for instance. When I tried to indicate that the recipe calls for 1.25lbs of sweet potatoes, I could not. Instead, there were many brands of sweet potatoes listed and none were available to input in quantities greater than 200 grams (pounds were not an option). I had to calculate grams to pounds and then input several different brands of sweet potatoes at 200-grams each. I had no idea if these were all plain, raw sweet potatoes. This seems really weird."
2,2,4,2017-07-18T22:41:51.000Z,0161019,Simple and Accurate,"Some time after using this app, I've realized it frequently miscalculated percentages of nutrients. The app is basically useless if it tells me I'm getting 0% of a vitamin when I'm actually getting 50%."
3,3,5,2019-04-08T20:00:06.000Z,Mljohnson1123,Eh..,"This app came soooo recommended that I pondered for a long time about buying it since it’s 4.99!!! I don’t normally just randomly pay for expensive apps. Yes the library is very extensive. However after journaling all my foods, all the nutrient information is smashed and you can’t see it. I am not sure if I’m missing a feature in the settings that I need to turn off or on. I have no idea but for that reason I am not impressed. I seriously think I just wasted 4.99. I would like a refund. I send a feedback to the company hoping they might fix it or tell me what I’m doing wrong but I haven’t heard back yet. I am not pleased!"

I teach an online nutrition class for a community college and have been searching for an app that is inexpensive, user friendly and not bias towards weight loss, that I could recommend to students."
5,5,3,2018-09-07T01:30:13.000Z,Maricat823,"Good Idea, Poor execution","There are a lot of requests to see the grams rather than % on journal. Keep color bar to determine percentage, and replace # with mg."

7,7,3,2021-02-13T15:16:31.000Z,MindyMart33,No copy and paste feature!!,"Just downloaded this app today, to help me track sodium, iron, and potassium. I am surprised that nobody complains that all recipes have to be entered the long way!! I would much rather have a quick copy and paste option, after finding a recipe I like from a website."
8,8,3,2020-09-20T14:39:32.000Z,dduukkiiee,Wish it were more accurate,"Either the nutrient listing on the back of the bag of Brad’s Crunchy Kale is way off, or your nutrient listing is way off. Whereas the Brad’s package says that there is 30% daily value of Vitamin A in 2 ounces of their product, the App says that there is over 2000% daily value of Vitamin A in 2 ounces of their product. I’ve noticed some other discrepancies as well, which tend to lower my level of trust in the App. I don’t regret buying the App, as it has helped me see where I am lacking in my diet, and it’s fun to see the bars on the chart increase when I add a certain food to address that issue. I just wish I could trust it more and don’t have to keep second guessing it."
9,9,3,2018-03-06T20:42:45.000Z,nathanwiens,"Works, but pretty buggy","I love the concept of this app, however I’ve seen numerous instances where a recipe I’ve added has a total calorie count, then the calories from fat are massively larger number than the total cals. E.G. pasta dish that’s 459 total kcals but from fat it’s over 1,000 kcals. Curious if it’s calculating the fat kcals from the whole dish and not dividing by servings as is the other nutrition metrics."
10,10,2,2017-07-03T02:23:21.000Z,Super annoyed subscriber 10001,Not for home cooks,"As a home cook, I'm disappointed in this app. Its food journal feature will let you choose between any number of commercially available, processed foods (i.e. Digiorno's pizza), but won't let you select basic ingredients that go into a home cooked recipe (i.e. pizza dough). I'm confused about this because presumably people who want to keep track of their nutrition are not the top consumers of processed foods like Digiorno's pizza? Also, the app seems really unscientific to me because it tells me how much of my recommended protein intake I've achieved per day without having ever asked me about my weight. My understanding is that your recommended daily value of protein is directly tied to how much you weigh so this feels sketchy to me. Would not recommend."
11,11,5,2017-07-19T13:18:19.000Z,buzzer0913,Best App For Tracking Nutrition IMO,"I have tried multiple other apps for tracking calories and this one is my favorite, hands down. The very simple search interface allows you to find the ENTIRE nutritional profile of an exact portion of food including total calories, total protein, fat, carbs, vitamins, and minerals. On top of that, you can add individual food items or even ENTIRE CUSTOM RECIPES to ""your journal"" which then keeps track of how much you have eaten for the day. Very happy I purchased this."
12,12,2,2018-01-17T02:10:58.000Z,Lhomey,Big disappointment,"I was so hopeful when I found this app! I wanted to input my own recipes and see a breakdown of nutrition per serving, which it does have the capacity to do. However... 1) the ingredient library is VERY limited, forcing me to input brands I didn’t use and just “hope” the nutritional value was similar to the brand I did use; 2) the only measurements option is metric (no option to measure in imperial measurements and, unfortunately, I don’t know the conversions off the top of my head, so I need an additional conversion app to use this app!); and 3) its not very intuitive in its setup and menu options. I wish there were a way to return an app... I just wasted $5 on this and I’ll never use it!"
13,13,2,2018-11-18T22:54:57.000Z,TiffanyGrace87,Great idea! Horrible execution!,"If this app had more food options this would be my favorite app. I love that it breaks down all of the nutrition within food and not just macros and carbs, fat and protein. I wanted a more intense look at the food I was eating and the nutritional value."
14,14,3,2018-11-30T15:02:16.000Z,Saussha,Would rate it a 5 but...,"Offers the very best tracking of all nutrients in food.  Other so are mostly concerned with calorie breakdown.  If you are like me, you are trying to see a bit more than that and you need to know about iron, calcium, minerals, etc...this is the app for you.  I’d give it a 5 for sure but it badly needs an update to allow the barcode scanner to work better.  All the times I have tried to scan, it’s only worked a couple times.  This ability to enter food and supplements is really important.  Please fix!! :)"
15,15,5,2018-12-09T11:24:13.000Z,4ZTYM,Best App Available!,I am so appreciative and grateful for you to give this app away for free. I am diabetic and need it so much and it has helped me to figure out the nutritional breakdown in my recipes. I have been having problems with kidney function and need to limit potassium and your app allows me to see exactly what I have in my recipes so I can add or eliminate certain ingredients.
16,16,5,2021-02-05T00:44:05.000Z,thankful1000,"Great App, Pantry has glitches",Great app for tracking your total nutrition picture. Easy to enter.  Perfect for I what- to make sure I am getting a sufficient amount of micro nutrients.
17,17,3,2020-11-20T00:52:03.000Z,scourge2bunnies,Bug Needs Fixing,"So far this is a very good app, but I’ve come across a few bugs that need fixing.  First bug: I tried to add a new item to my pantry, and it overwrote another item I had in the pantry.  I ended up with 2 versions of the new item and the other item disappeared.  Second bug:  I was adding a new item to my pantry, and the nutrition values were being stored in the wrong places.  The item had 300 mg of sodium.  I entered the Sodium, but the app displayed it as 300 g of sugar.  I entered the amount of sugar, and it wasn’t displayed at all. Since I’m diabetic, this bug really concerns me.  Can you please fix it?"
18,18,3,2020-11-28T18:45:26.000Z,veggieeater97,Works sometimes.,"The app glitches a lot. You can’t add your own custom foods, you can’t make recipes with the foods that are already listed on the app. When journaling sometimes it’ll get stuck and put the wrong nutrient info no matter what portion you’re journaling it may say something like 4000 calories for .5 cup of beans. I normally don’t write reviews but paying for this app, and not having it work the way it was designed to is frustrating. It’s not completely bad, but there are a lot of limitations I’d like to see fixed."
19,19,1,2020-05-05T23:18:01.000Z,.::D-JayDizzle::.,Not worth the time,"When I saw the barcode scanner, I was pumped because I thought it would be something I could scan in my supplements, pre-packaged foods, etc. You can’t. Their database support for this app must be extremely limited, because I have yet to find something I can scan in! Then, to try and stay on track, you spend hours (if you’re me) looking for ingredient equivalents on their app, which only gives you a roundabout estimation of your consumption at best! Finally, since I paid for the app, I waited to see if they would upload more stuff to their database. It doesn’t appear that they have. Overall: 1/5, do NOT recommend."
20,20,1,2017-10-15T16:40:12.000Z,NeedsAccuracy,Limited foods... no option to add your own food brands,"Nice app if you're not concerned with accuracy. The food journal nutrition information doesn't tell you the total quantity (mg, mcg, IU, etc.) of the vitamin or mineral, it only shows a percentage you have consumed. The total vitamins and minerals needed for males and females is different and the app doesn't ask for sex to calculate the correct RDIs."
21,21,3,2018-05-02T12:23:48.000Z,twigatano,Needs Work,I’m not confident that this a very accurate tracker. It has a wide range of values for example for peeled potatoes. Seems that should be pretty straightforward per gram...
22,22,4,2018-09-13T15:38:36.000Z,Julia98-16,Very Detailed!,"I really like this app for the most part. I wanted to track my nutrition, but most apps are based solely around calories and weight loss... not good for someone recovering from an eating disorder."
23,23,4,2018-10-30T22:58:14.000Z,Kittymyuri,Overall exactly what I was looking for,Just what I was looking for- an easy to read macro tracker. I just wish it were easier to use the other features of it. It would be nice to be able to scan bar codes or to have suggested ingredients to make up for any deficiencies. It would also be nice if it connected to some kind of recipe site and helped with nutrient analysis of the recipients too.
24,24,3,2019-01-06T20:56:59.000Z,jasovi,Helpful Overall But Still Need to Supplement (pardon the pun),"Overall, I like the detailed nutritional data the app provides. It does fall short in some areas. Specifically, the app:"

26,26,3,2019-02-27T01:17:28.000Z,heatherMSRD,"If you fix this, it would be great!","I’m a dietitian and I enjoy a lot of things about this app EXCEPT that it gets some nutrient values totally wrong. For example, if you enter a sizable portion of raw sunflower seeds, the vitamin E level doesn’t budge a single percentage point. This is clearly inaccurate, as sunflower seeds are quite high in vitamin E. I’ve seen this happen with some other values around folate and zinc as well. There are some definite gaps in syncing up foods from the list and their corresponding nutrient content. If you fixed this misleading element, it would be nearly perfect!"
27,27,1,2019-05-28T15:28:34.000Z,penh,Not a useful app at all,"I wanted to track my nutritional intake to make sure I was getting enough vitamins, and was put-off by how “weight loss” focused other apps were, so I gave this a try. I cook at home, and input my recipes, but was confused to learn I could only use their library of ingredients, which doesn’t have a lot of my products. There’s no way to manually enter a product yourself. Once you manage to piece together a recipe that’s similar to what you make, there’s no way to add it to your daily journal of what you ate that day. A total waste of $5."
28,28,1,2020-02-15T17:15:15.000Z,Sunil Jaiprashad,Limited,So the app is limited on sizes for items when creating a recipe for example you cannot enter 413g. You either get 350g or 465g(which you have to use a cups because the most grams you can enter is 200g using their options.
29,29,4,2020-05-24T22:52:24.000Z,Food Allergy Friendly,"Very useful, would like to see more foods in the journal","Great app to track vitamins, minerals, calories, etc especially if you have to avoid certain foods and want to keep a balanced diet. Only recommendation is I would like to see more unusual fresh fruits/vegetables listed like broccolini, bok choy, various sweet potatoes (white varieties like Japanese yam or Hannah yam-they have less vitamin A than the orange varieties). Although for raw arugula they have several “brands” which throws me off?"

32,32,4,2018-06-11T19:14:51.000Z,ratermayor,App meets realistic expectations,I love this app. I need a general over view of the nutrients I intake. I eat mostly whole foods. This app takes time to get used to and a discerning eye for what you’re actually inputing. I’ve found everything to be functional and fairly accurate. Recipes work really well and cut down on inputing data. Especially the daily intake calculator. Often times I use the app as a database to plan meals. I use a scale at home to measure my food and it makes using this app much easier. Thats actually true of any tracker though.
33,33,4,2018-12-28T16:01:50.000Z,Pernà,Love this app!  Want these features...,I love using this app!  It is great for helping me to understand nutritional values of foods I eat.  I would love these features:
34,34,4,2020-07-05T22:36:01.000Z,FiFi__1985__SXO,Great App but need help with Pantry,"This is a great dietary app with all the details you allow for. I just used the new pantry feature to add a food, I went add a second food, I could not figure out how to do so. I was expecting to see a plus sign that are elsewhere in the app.  Also, in a future release would you incorporate “added sugar”."
35,35,4,2021-08-18T14:53:02.000Z,Doris43321,Good app,"I purchased this app because I wanted more details about the nutrients I was eating that other calorie counter apps just don’t provide. Specifically my iron intake since I am anemic. It works well and gives you a general idea, but don’t expect 100% accuracy since many foods aren’t listed and you need to find a close match."
36,36,3,2021-07-28T01:31:51.000Z,lenarodifer,Good concept but somethings off,"I wanted to like this app, and at first use I thought it was great. But after paying close attention, the daily analysis values do not match up to the totals from the journal entries. also, the daily values I set up for myself in my profile don’t carry over to the daily analysis either. If the analysis was accurately carrying over the data from profile and journal I would love this."
37,37,3,2020-11-07T22:37:24.000Z,Andrew Vegan,"Good, but...","So I wasn’t a big fan of FitnessPal and I like the look and feel of this app.  The biggest drawback is when you enter in something into the Pantry, it goes out and grabs information that may already be in the database.  If I am adding something to my Pantry, I want it to reflect the nutrients that I put into it and not something in the database, that is incorrect."
38,38,1,2021-01-26T16:33:15.000Z,BatmanLex,Waste of Money,"There are better trackers available for free. I purchased this app because I didn’t want to pay the expensive subscription fees for other tracker apps to track more nutrients such as fiber intake, etc. The app doesn’t recognize half of my frequently eaten meals and snacks so all of that would have to be manually entered and it’s just not worth my time to do so when there are plenty of apps I can use that do this automatically."
39,39,1,2020-06-24T15:30:24.000Z,ABK1319,Disappointed,"I paid $5 for an app that I was only able to use for two days. I have tried to use the app on my iPhone AND my iPad. Both devices software are up to date.  I have had it downloaded for over a week and since the second day I’ve had it, it will not even open. I emailed the support email provided last week and no one has responded. Great concept but a complete waste of money and poor customer service."

There’s such a tiny catalog of food options almost none of the food I have in my cabinet or drinks from fast food places in my car have a profile on here."

44,44,2,2019-08-09T13:28:57.000Z,Dodgeman4700,Not user friendly,"It does not have many brand name items.  So I have to use generic items most of the time.  The data is not that accurate when used in this manner.  The database needs to include brand name items I get from the grocery store.  I shop at target for example.  No target brand items exist in this database.  Also, a barcode scanner option would be nice."
45,45,1,2020-08-02T01:21:46.000Z,GWGregg,Wasted $4.99,"Just downloaded this app today to find it’s very buggy on my iPad.  Newly created ingredients don’t add well to recipes.  Existing ingredients don’t scale nutrients properly when adding partial or multiple servings.  And as of ten minutes ago, the app is now crashing on launch.  All other apps are behaving fine, so it’s definitely a problem with this one.  Have tried restarting iPad, with no help.  Wasted $4.99 and wish I could get a refund."
46,46,2,2021-03-05T17:23:19.000Z,ffka,Could be so much better!,"Great info but it is missing so much! You can’t add food to past days (if you forget something) and there are hardly any “whole” ingredients. Like dried fruit, nuts, grains. It’s mostly highly processed/packaged foods. Also the barcode scan doesn’t work. There’s no way to change your settings. Very frustrating app. For $5 I expect a lot more!"

52,52,5,2019-01-24T18:51:50.000Z,Ninja McQuade,Excellent,The app tracks all the basic nutrients and is nice for saving recipes. Best I’ve found. I only wish the journal view had an option to click on a day to see amino acid values!!

There was no free trial because you would not purchase this app when the free ones available are far superior with a live selection of foods that can be scanned in. This app only offers the most common brands such as Quacker. Save your money and get a free version or at least one with a free Trial. These reviews c  as my be legit.
59,59,3,2020-05-26T03:55:14.000Z,An's Review,Good app but 1 false claim,Cons; advertises support of family sharing but This app Does not support family sharing. Some of the nutrients listed per food   Is not it a complete list.  Pros: It works and is useful to manage diet and provides all nutritional content and sync with apple Health.

I was very excited about having this feature available.  Unfortunately, however, whenever I do select a nutrient to be sorted, the list which populates is not in the correct order from highest to lowest.  The results are all over the place.  For example, (And I'm just making up data here to illustrate my point) if you decide to sort by highest fat to lowest fat, the number of grams of fat for the sequenced items will go from something like 40 to 39 then up erroneously to 62 then back down to thirty something then back up to some random number...If this problem could be fixed, I would happily give this app 4 or 5 stars.  It would also be great to see more types of food added...Again, nice idea but the app needs some work put into it to make sure the information is displaying and sorting correctly."

I am willing to pay more for ""pro"" features and even in-app features when one knows in advance what is offered and what isn't.  But there is something sneaky, unpleasant, and really, really expensive about the features in this app and the way one learns what one does and doesn't get in the free version.  All the apps these folks develop are on the high side, but combine that fact with a rather high-handed marketing strategy and I (and others, I see) in the end will not purchase features on principle (and on price) that we well might have bought otherwise."

I think it would be nice if they could list foods that have the most to the least of that nutrient based on typical serving size of each food item.  Right now it compares 100 grams of each food and you can adjust individually for serving size; ex cup or fillets) It's nice, but comparing typical serving sizes of each item as well would make things clearer quicker.  While an herb may have a lot per 100 oz when we eat less than a tsp is not the same as a item that we eat a whole cup of;  Just an idea for updates, but I like the app and am grateful for the information on nutrition it puts at my fingertips."

What's awesome is it's customizability for those who can't or choose not to eat certain food groups, and it is specific enough to where you can really make educated decisions about certain things. I would like to see further expanding on types of foods, as well as grass-fed vs. grain fed and more beef choices, but other than that, this is the best app anyone looking to improve their nutrition could ask for!

It's nice I can finally look up yogurt (a food missing from previous version), but I have to scroll through like 50 versions of yogurt before I get to plain, whole milk yogurt. It would be worth it if additional nutrients were added (like choline, omega fats, etc) but they weren't. And some foods I eat still aren't listed. Sigh. Hopefully it will be worth it for the foods I eat that weren't in the previous version but made it in this one."

Can't you have a drop down menu so we can change the portion size, like they have on the Self Nutrition facts website? It is awkward. You can't do comparisons. Still useful, just much less so than it could be. Search function is clumsy too. It took me 5 minutes to find an egg because it was listed as ""whole egg"" alphabetically. I would expect when I type in ""egg"" to have an egg pop up first, rather than eggnog and egg mix (a USDA commodity, in case you didn't know).

However there are a few things that would make this a great app!  First, my purpose is to track my nutrients every day. But the journal does not allow you to go back and edit a day's items. This was a real bummer.  I woke up this morning and was forced to enter my food items from last night, on today's date.  Also, I am using this for the purpose of tracking my vitamin needs during my pregnancy.  So it would be extremely helpful  if there was some way to calculate everything daily.   There is no other app out there that does this.  If these two functions were added, I am sure you could definitely increase your revenue.  Especially if you would promote it to the pregnancy community.  Finally, it would be great if you simply added a notes page. Where users could take personal notes. Ideally, integrated into the journal page some how.  I am calculating my nutrients and storing key details in a notepad.  I am sure this one is probably an easy add."
109,109,3,2016-06-13T20:38:14.000Z,Cococove,Some obvious fixable shortcomings,"1. The food list is too limited. This really needs a custom food function so users can add their own foods manually with the nutritional information. For example, as part of my diet I got no natural source of B12 so regularly eat nutritional yeast flakes fortified with B12 - I can't record this and my micronutrient journal will always show a major vitamin B12 deficiency. This obviates the point of nutrition tracking. There is no reason to keep users from adding personal custom foods to their pantries."

If you need to measure out your foods to determine Carbs, Protein, and Fat levels, this is the app for you.

You can even manipulate the amount of the food and it will automatically recalculate the nutritional values based on the amount you selected. Try it!"

I tried to sort the list based on calories, and by sodium and by Potassium, and the levels are never really in low-to-high order. They're a bit scrambled up. And it seems to exclude the foods that have none (zero) of the nutrient in question, which would be extremely helpful when trying to follow a restricted diet."

I'd be happy to input the nutritional information of some of my commonly eaten foods  that aren't listed, but as of right now I have no way to accurately record them.

138,138,1,2016-05-02T21:44:41.000Z,Desert_mike,ALMOST,"Good source of raw info but not useful as it could be.  A very disconnected and buggy.  You can waste so much time you're likely to forget why your trying.  Adding food to the pantry doesn't work, so you have to search each ingredient over again.  Create a recipe and there is no way to know the collective nutrient value.  The iPhone & iPad work independent so plan on doing it twice.  After three emails to support and no response, I guess there is none.  I am also disappointed in Apple for allowing this inferior app. For profit"
139,139,5,2017-04-26T13:14:34.000Z,Zeloso musicophile,Great app for whole foods,"I have been using this app for years and I rely on it more than my other nutritional trackers. The info is robust and accurate, the list of whole foods is great! I would like to add my supplements, but I am forced to use another app for that feature & refer to the tally in the health app. Still, overall an excellent app!"
140,140,5,2011-07-01T14:08:51.000Z,iron bridge,Keep going!,"This is a helpful app. If you don't see the food you want be PATIENT. There are updates. Just got one that added things people requested.  Please add CHOCOLATE! Different kinds; dark, milk, etc., for those of us who want to dissect our chocolate lives. Keep adding more foods. It is so interesting to analyze what you eat."
141,141,5,2012-07-03T18:29:39.000Z,FlagHag,My New Favorite App,I recently started a weight training program that requires a high protein diet. I have been searching everything I eat individually to ensure I ingest what my body needs. Now that I have this app I all the food and info is in one place. I recommend this app to anyone who wants to keep it simple.
142,142,5,2012-12-16T12:37:28.000Z,Crystalina19K,Tell everyone!,"I tell everyone I can about this app! With so many people complaining about food allergies ad sensitivities and missing out on nutrients, I think this app is the best way to find out how to get to the nutrients they think they can't get anywhere else. So worth it!"
143,143,5,2014-05-02T11:26:40.000Z,RBJ54,Pedantic Food Planning,"This app is for you if the heading describes you. Knowing empty from potent calories can make all the difference in food choice. It's possible to actually achieve 100% of the RDA on a 2000 calorie diet, and not depend too heavily on vitamin/mineral supplements. I only wish I could synch my lists between devices or a cloud database."
144,144,3,2014-10-11T23:04:46.000Z,EB Hiker,Useful but needs other features,Pros:  the app has fairly extensive food lists and I like that it is integrated with the Apple Health app.
145,145,4,2015-07-22T11:59:25.000Z,MarsX99,Wow,I'm really impressed with how comprehensive and easy to use this app is.
146,146,5,2015-10-14T02:58:22.000Z,Centrallanding,Excellent!,"I am really impressed with Foodle. It tells me everything I need to know about just about any food. All of the nutritional information you would find on a label (calories, carbs, protein, vitamins, minerals) plus amino acids. I could quickly see why a pear is a much better choice than an apple. Love it!"
147,147,5,2016-05-20T00:50:00.000Z,ChiRunner,Perfect for what I needed,This is a great app particularly if you find that geeky moment in life where you MUST know (approx) how many of what kind of nutrients you are taking in per meal.
148,148,3,2016-09-13T00:05:38.000Z,ZXDERTV,Disappointed,I was looking for an application that would allow me to enter recipes and give me the nutrient value for those recipes. It does do this. However I can find no way to add recipes to the foods item or the name list therefore I am not able to put it into the journal. I would like to keep track of all the nutrients I eat per day. Is there anyway of doing this on this application?
149,149,5,2016-10-28T17:25:40.000Z,_Gary.F,What I needed,"I wanted a food app that isn't just a calorie tracker. This is a nutrition app including calories. I don't need to watch my weight. I'd just like to know what's in the food I'm eating. This app seems to provide that information in great depth. Also I can keep a record, although I don't really need that."
150,150,5,2011-12-24T20:26:15.000Z,Galway22,"New, but.....","Just started using this app, but very impressed, so far...."

Only suggestion would be to be able to compare two different vegetables or fruits side by side..  Thanks or an awesome app."
152,152,3,2012-05-24T14:58:57.000Z,Wishfuljules,Just one thing missing,"Attractive app with lots of useful information, all virtually unusable because everything is categorized in terms of 100 grams per serving.  The average consumer has no idea what 100 grams means when it comes to per serving quantities.  Store labels typically provide ""per cup"" or ""per Tbs"" etc. in the nutritional information.  Can't the makers of this app do the same?"
153,153,4,2012-07-17T22:21:19.000Z,MichellyNerd,Great app - just 1 or 2 holes...,"Fabulous app. You can look up complete nutrition info for a variety of whole food, plus you can look up specific nutrients to see what foods contain them. Mysteriously missing from the meat category is the range of beef items - save for one, ground beef. They have bear and bison and caribou, but no steak or roast beef? Seriously!"
154,154,1,2013-06-07T03:30:57.000Z,Nurse230,New version lacking key items,"Unless I'm missing something they new version has two glaring omissions from earlier version. First is search tool. Second is a correct list of foods highest in specific nutrients from most to least. For instance vitamin a or protein. You can select it but the order is no longer starting with the item with the most. Since his was one of the main reasons I liked this app, really don't like it now."
155,155,5,2013-06-30T06:42:37.000Z,CHODEFUNK MCBLASTCHUNK,Awesome food guide!,"Everything about it is very useful. I have an idea though, to make it more of a one-stop guide: for each vitamin/mineral, include a short explanation of what it does for you. Obviously it's an easy google, but it would be convenient. :)"
156,156,1,2013-08-26T23:39:52.000Z,Heisenburg von Calrissian,Am I confused? What?,You have to pay to sort the foods by type or category.
157,157,4,2014-10-22T11:28:43.000Z,Lyndsbelle,"Love the app, but","Love the app! It has become where I turn to for my nutritional counts, but it doesn't write enough data to HealthKit. I would like to see it write all possible data to HealthKit so that I can track everything it provides :). Other than that it's DEFINITELY worth the money!"
158,158,1,2015-05-23T14:38:17.000Z,Havrosha,Disappointing,"It is not what I expected. Very limited and not user friendly: if you give top 100 foods with a certain vitamin, it would be logical to place a food with the highest content of the vitamin at the top of the list and with the lowest content at the bottom. The app is just an attempt to categorize random information about food. If I need just information, Google and Wikipedia are sufficient. I wish I could try the app before purchasing. I would never purchase it."

This app makes it possible for me to eat! Strongly recommended for anyone on a restricted diet and especially for folks, like me, on kidney dialysis."
160,160,5,2011-06-04T05:05:58.000Z,Artemis23,Great App!!,"I love this app, which has an astounding array of foods listed (wondering why, however, that while it lists foods as obscure and unlikely as caribou rump and acorns, they overlooked pumpkin seeds and sesame butter, which I eat often). The in-app purchase for nutrients is definitely worth getting too."
161,161,5,2012-06-05T03:00:16.000Z,Gun Man on the grassy noll,PaleoQueen,Awesome app to check carb content on uncertain foods. FYI- You can change the serving size by tapping the top right corner that says 100g. You can then choose multiple serving sizes. I would LOVE to be able to enter my food for the day to see all nutritional value.
162,162,5,2012-12-25T17:16:13.000Z,Liferndob,Amazing!,"My brother, who has type 1 diabetes uses this app to count carbs. It's really helpful for him. I also use it all the time to ensure that I am getting enough iron/protein/etc with my vegan diet. This app is amazing and I recommend it to everyone!"

Somehow Meat Only has 200+ calories where Meat with Skin only has 173 calories?  I compared the information with a website I normally use and it shows the Meat with Skin option to be the closest.  I was hoping this app would provide an alternative to the website I use."
164,164,5,2013-07-21T06:11:56.000Z,Dannix128,Great for diabetics,"Being a type 1 diabetic, I have to count carbs in everything I eat. This app has made it easier to look up the nutrition information on many foods. Truly an amazing app!! Every diabetic should have this app."
165,165,3,2013-09-03T04:14:52.000Z,ilovenewwave,"Absolutely great, BUT ultimately high cost","So convenient to have, but I didn't realize each individual section costs a dollar or two. There is a section to keep more than three food favorites (one or two dollars) search foods by nutritional content (extra couple bucks) and even more. Ultimately a $10 app"
166,166,5,2015-02-26T21:04:36.000Z,Petite add,Good app need more features,"I love the detailed nutrient info, but I wish they had a search bar and easier to use journal where you can journal by meal and an automatic steps counter and add exercise otherwise this is a knockout app!"
167,167,5,2016-01-18T20:55:18.000Z,LarryJS33,Top Shelf App!,"After using this app for over two years it does a credible job for all my searches. I personally have added many items to the journal. If I could, I would give ten stars!!!"
168,168,3,2016-06-23T00:11:13.000Z,Bambimiller,Needs more,"I like a lot of the features, however allowing the user to add and save products and nutritional info would be better or even to scan them into the system. I'm vegan and there aren't any protein powders that are plant based or plant based cheese either. So my journal shows me having a protein deficiency."
169,169,3,2017-01-15T02:09:29.000Z,FitBliss,Limited,"Been using for a week and like the app however it needs to allow the user to input their own recipes/ingredients with nutrient info if the food item is not in the app database. Can't track nutrients accurately if you can't input data, a barcode scanner feature would be awesome too!"
170,170,5,2011-08-03T03:15:55.000Z,Srm22180,Serving sizes,Best feature are the selectable and ver practical serving sizes like 1 medium banana versus 100g which nobody can relate to - purchased both paid addons for $3 that allow me to rank for example all leafy greens according to rank in any given vitamin or mineral - very eye opening!
171,171,3,2012-08-15T02:43:31.000Z,Jeneveseel,"Paid, but it locked again! Huh?!","I do like those apps idea. It is helpful to look up in nutrients and number percent what fruits & veg contain.. However, I'm very disappointed with this apps!! Because I had paid to unlock, they are lock again. It's not 99 cents! It was 1.71. Im not gonna pay n pay again n again!"
172,172,5,2013-02-06T01:18:10.000Z,Alfred760,Great quick nutrition info!,This app makes it very simple to keep track or just have the information required to keep track of nutrition intake. I mainly use it for the fruits and vegetables!
173,173,5,2013-03-05T01:43:22.000Z,D-rej,Very helpful,"Exactly what I was looking for - a simple, quick way to look up whole foods instead of specific products like other apps do for you."
174,174,5,2013-04-03T23:04:52.000Z,Dward4904,Great app,This app is very handy. It is great if you are looking for more than just calorie or fat content. You can look at the food to see its nutrition or you can search by nutrient to find which foods are the best sources.
175,175,3,2013-07-21T06:12:33.000Z,Karolyshka,Too many options,"I don't have a paid version but w this one there are way too many options for commercial foods. Hard to search and some items are hard to find. I think I was happier w fewer options. I do like the cooked vs raw options, amazing how many nutrients are lost in process."
176,176,2,2013-08-05T20:26:39.000Z,Zedsdeadbaybee,"great idea, but...","almost every ""serving size"" is unrealistic and/or requires so much measuring and calculation that it's pointless to use this app.  i could just google ""nutrition facts for an ear of corn"" (or banana, or steak or whatever) and get the info i want much more easily."
177,177,5,2014-10-23T19:22:49.000Z,Protonik,Excellent source of information!,Very complete and each upgrade gets better and better
178,178,1,2015-05-03T16:45:08.000Z,esinopole,Needs a cumulative nutrition journal,The journal is nothing more than a list of foods you ate - it does not generate a cumulative overview of of you nutrition for the day and make the app useless if you are trying to track your vitamin and mineral intake. How am I supposed to know what vitamins I am low in for the day? The app is the best I have seen to itemize the vitamins and mineral for EACH ITEM but the journal ruins the whole app for me. Please add a tracking system!
179,179,5,2016-09-25T18:22:48.000Z,PowerObject!,Cool app using USDA's latest nutrient database,"However, not sure if app developer modified item descriptions to simplify search because searching for ""cashews"" on USDA site brings up bunch of results but not in this app. Your app finds only ""cashew"".

Sure it would be nice if everything we ate was listed, but I believe you are on the right track offering a quality research base.  Thank you!"
181,181,3,2011-05-06T21:40:42.000Z,Shaker,Very Informative,"Nice to have nutritional info at hand all the time & for free. One suggestion is that it could have an added feature of sorting or listing food in ascending/ descending order based on a specific nutrient, like food in ascending order of protein, or food in descending order of a certain fat, etc."

Having to watch the iron I consume (or other less common nutrients), this app is perfect for many specific sorting by nutrients."

It's all right there for you it's great!! I do wish it wasn't in g/mg. I'm having a hard time converting all that right now. But other then that I love it!

187,187,4,2013-06-23T13:32:02.000Z,Mike0522,Great App,This app is loaded with information. I love it. There is nutrition information on foods I've never heard of. It is over the top with good info.  The only thing it needs is a search feature and it would be over the top.
188,188,3,2015-01-26T08:04:36.000Z,"Moi, monsieur",Needed info,"Great thorough info and good selection on quantities of each item (eg: apple 1 /2 cup, 1 small, etc). I noticed unsweetened almond milk is not listed or traditional rolled oats. Also, caffeine isn't transferring to Health app when ""journal""-ing my coffee intake. Makes me wonder what other categories aren't being transferred accurately either."

190,190,3,2012-02-15T19:37:20.000Z,Ladomnias,Good but crashes,Solid info. Very nice to have. Would be a five star if it did not crash all the time and was a little easier to search and

193,193,4,2012-10-10T04:45:38.000Z,Squats are good for your knees,Great app!,"Great user interface, clean presentation, very informative and thoughtfully laid out. One thing that would improve the app is the glycemic index listed under each food (where available). Overall great."
194,194,3,2012-10-28T16:52:29.000Z,Aaronw1,Needs a little more,Informative and helpful app. It would be nice if you could tap the mineral or vitamins and it could give you a general rundown of what they are useful for. Possibly some symptoms of deficiencies even. Otherwise a nice app. It would be nice to have more updates.
195,195,5,2012-12-27T07:54:54.000Z,Cellist1995,A wonderful app!,A wonderful & helpful app!!!!! I would recommend this in a heart beat to anyone who is interested to find out what is in certain foods and the essentials!!! Thank you!!!

199,199,5,2016-04-21T12:25:26.000Z,MJB6919,All you want to know about the food you eat.,Very detailed app. It's a must for people on a diet. Makes keeping track of calories and carbs easy.
200,200,4,2011-04-22T21:55:38.000Z,PurpleChips19,Sort by nutrients,"I left off a star because I think you could improve by adding a sort field by nutrients. eg. Sort to see which food has the most Zinc, the most Vitamin K, etc. otherwise super app."
201,201,5,2011-05-31T01:18:44.000Z,Sugahfaced,Awesome tool,This app is great when counting calories or just when you need a little extra info about the foods you eat.
202,202,5,2011-06-02T02:54:16.000Z,Stephy.17,Fantastic!,"This app is very helpful, especially when one loves to indulge in food as I do while also being so interested in nutrition as a whole. Love it!"
203,203,4,2011-06-05T15:52:06.000Z,B_C_,Great reference app!!,Easy to use and look up with lots of info. Need to be able to enter your own serving size instead of just the preset options. Near perfect otherwise.
204,204,3,2011-07-20T05:36:18.000Z,Gio.ro,Good needs to b better,Great visuals. But can't figure out how allspice could have so many calories and grams of fat. All herbs are somewhat misleading. Also wish it had more variety of commonly eaten foods. Although I don't know if they r available at the paid version.
205,205,4,2011-08-06T22:39:55.000Z,Denunuke,What is missing.,"The app is nice and easy to use, however I would welcome a feature that told me what the certain vitamins etc are good for. For example: calcium is good for the bones, vitamin E for the eyes, and so on. Please, develop such an addition."
206,206,3,2011-08-08T14:22:44.000Z,FrugalHands,A little confusing,I'm not sure what the percentages mean. Is it percent in the fruit or my daily recommended percentage for 2000 calories. Also could use more foods. And ounces would be better than 100 grams. A gram is so small it is hard to know how much 100 is without a scale.
207,207,5,2011-12-13T23:03:42.000Z,iApple Freak,Best Food app EVER!,"This is the best food app ever! (as you read in my title) I would recommend this app for all iAppers out there! I had to use this app for a school project, and it totally helped me out!"
208,208,3,2014-11-28T20:00:21.000Z,Canarycreeper,Good info but needs a data synthesis feature,Lots of great info on nutrition of each food. Only 3 stars b/c I would like a way to process that info so that I can see how much of each nutrient/ vitamin/ mineral I am getting over the course of a day or week.
209,209,2,2014-12-08T04:56:10.000Z,ratonian,Needs variable serving sizes,"This app has a lot of information, but the serving sizes are ridiculous. First search for honey returned information for one cup. I really only needed a teaspoon.  Second search for bacon, one cup! I guess I could recalculate everything to size, but why? The addition of variable serving sizes would make this a 5 star app"
210,210,5,2011-05-25T13:55:29.000Z,Mondster,And it's free!,"Great app. Very pretty, easy to understand.  The only thing I could think to add to this would maybe be a meal calculator. Definitely worth 5 stars."
211,211,5,2011-07-31T16:18:18.000Z,chazrachelle,Perfect for me,I love this app for a quick reference for dietary qualities in the foods I eat. It is easy to use and fast. I have found myself using the app daily.
212,212,4,2012-03-13T13:09:42.000Z,Iworkinout,Beautiful Creative and Informative,I just don't like that in order to access the Full app I now have to purchase the rest of the information. I feel tricked.
213,213,2,2012-08-01T03:48:31.000Z,Sngglebune,Lacking content,Lacking a lot of variety in food choices available. The basics but searching doesn't allow for expansion of options to choose from. Too many in-app purchase options leaving this free app not worth the time to use.
214,214,4,2013-05-02T10:20:58.000Z,Thaedion,Beautiful app... But the name...,"I love the app always have, but the name change and the app icon that goes with it? I'm glad to see that the internal icons are still very nice. Whatever, you lose 1 star for external aesthetics."
215,215,3,2013-05-13T23:57:30.000Z,Andrew4549,Serious oversight!,"This app is great. It has an enormous amount of information. It is incomprehensible that, with all of the thousands of foods that are listed, they do not have a search tool. That's so important I have to charge them two stars!"
216,216,5,2013-05-31T17:49:51.000Z,By ,Fantastic App,Love this app. I use it constantly. It has so much information
217,217,4,2014-03-14T21:51:30.000Z,urbncwby,Excellent app!,Only thing this is missing is ability to enter custom serving sizes. Nice to finally have a nutrition info app that's not a meal tracker so people can check things out at their own leisure.
218,218,5,2015-01-02T23:46:31.000Z,GinooniG,Awe-some,Straight nutrition facts about basically anything you could eat. I'm using it as a plant-based eater to make sure I have it all straight. Great job
219,219,4,2015-05-30T21:07:22.000Z,=[Gh0st]=,Great app,Overall great app. I wish you could add your own foods and categories to really customize and track your nutrition. maybe with the next update.
220,220,2,2011-06-05T23:03:09.000Z,Oarboy,Disgruntled omnivore,"Useful information...as far as it goes, but seriously? There's no entry for tofu. I'm not even a vegetarian and I find that absurd. Maybe it's in the upgrade, but if the first thing I look up isn't in the database I'm not paying for something that still might not even have the info."
221,221,5,2011-07-30T01:45:41.000Z,vi of NorthernCalif.,Top in this category,Paid quite a bit trying to find what this free one has---for FREE !!
222,222,4,2012-03-08T05:01:35.000Z,Urbncwby81,Pricey,"Not a bad app but the in app purchases are too much. I like the way you can make your own serving size for example for grapes you can break it down to 1 grape, 1 cup, 100 grams, etc"
223,223,5,2012-06-30T22:35:22.000Z,Owen's mama 454,Great app,Easy to use and seems to have all common food listed. Glad I bought it.
224,224,5,2012-12-12T00:29:41.000Z,Days62784,Top 5 App,This App doesn't get enough credit for the amount of information that it provides. Love it!
225,225,5,2013-02-01T11:04:49.000Z,Judy of Centre Street,Meets my needs,Easy to use. Full of info on ingredients. I did not get charged anything for the parts I was looking for
226,226,4,2013-02-05T21:50:37.000Z,PaigeBeatrice,Helpful for the Educated,"Great app, wide variety of food options. I found the vitamin and mineral content particularly helpful. Make sure you know how to read food labels before investing in this app!"
227,227,5,2013-02-08T03:52:35.000Z,DannyinTX,Very nice app and easy to understand!!,I am new to exploring nutritional facts and found this app to be very educational. Definitely worth the upgrade!
228,228,3,2013-06-10T22:35:46.000Z,Hotside123,Like not love,"It's a nice app but not worth the paid version: too many obscure meats. I don't really care about the nutritional value of walrus, and I would rather not see it on the top 100 list for iron along with seal and beaver and 50 different kinds of organ meat."
229,229,5,2013-06-20T21:44:05.000Z,thagodfathr,Great App,Been using this app for a long time and the newest update added a lot of new food. Looks and works great!
230,230,5,2011-07-09T23:17:41.000Z,Nick GMZ,Great App for free,"It's free but some features do cost.  I enjoy using the free version, but I probably will buy soon.  Even free version is worth the download."
231,231,5,2012-02-13T04:45:37.000Z,Lisa25543,Suggestion,Excellent app i love it! You should include a feature wherw ou can record what ou eat each day and how much of eah vitamin and mineral you actually consumed.
232,232,3,2012-06-12T03:43:34.000Z,Krug j.,Grape juice?,"Looks and works nice, but it's lacking."
233,233,4,2012-10-03T04:07:22.000Z,Dukati plate,Four Stars,"Would give 5 stars except for all the locks...good way to get people to upgrade though. Good information, like the Wikipedia option."
234,234,2,2012-10-11T23:16:56.000Z,Gengaeldelse,"Nice app, crappy price","While the app is user friendly and fast, you have to pay $0.99 to unlock each food category. You could spend over $15 for this app!"
235,235,5,2013-03-17T01:02:54.000Z,Seema Rathore,Useful app,"Wonderful app, anytime anywhere you can check nutritional values of food item"
236,236,4,2013-05-31T00:51:44.000Z,ACrawl2,Awesome,"Very good resource. It's great. If you guys are looking for the search tool. Tap the ""names"" section, look at the top toolbar. That icon is awesome, hopefully the in app graphics will get refined a bit also. Great job"
237,237,1,2013-06-12T19:29:21.000Z,Elbieporter,My Food,"Very unhappy with update. Basic my food was all fresh and natural foods with good nutritional info. Will be looking for something to replace my favorite ap with. Don't know why this company can't offer both My Food and Foodle. Don't even like the name. As a professional nutritionist, I always recommended My Food to clients. Will be deleting this ap. :-("
238,238,5,2015-12-12T09:31:15.000Z,Brandon white,Great,"Extremely informative, accurate, and up-to-date."
239,239,5,2016-03-15T03:33:18.000Z,John Deere gal88,Very useful,Exceptionally useful for those special needs diets. Much handier than a printed book and is complete for my inquiries. Nice to have.
240,240,5,2011-04-27T12:54:55.000Z,G0j0,Suggestions,Add the ability to put in weight of item and have the nutritional facts calculated
241,241,4,2011-09-01T16:20:26.000Z,Nespakashuty,What is missing,If only it told me what Manganese is good for...
242,242,4,2011-09-07T22:55:47.000Z,2Specgirls,Protein dieters,"Easy to use. needs  beverages, teas, coffee etc. Def bacon, sour cream, heavy cream, pork rinds, things that are staples in the protein diet plans used by Diabetics. otherwise, very informative. Love the cup, slice, etc breakdowns!  Need better review of what I get if I purchase adtl add ons."
243,243,5,2012-05-08T17:14:23.000Z,Razzzie,Cool App! Thanks!,Pretty neat as I was always wondering what the contents of my foods were to accurately gauge for my sports diet.
244,244,4,2012-09-27T12:21:03.000Z,KBag,Fast fix.,Appreciate the fast fix of the previous update. It's working well again now.
245,245,5,2012-09-30T14:39:12.000Z,SteveBroxxx,Great for juicing,This is one of the best apps I have found.   We juice for a sick family member who needs certain vitamins and minerals. It is perfect!
246,246,5,2013-02-14T02:21:00.000Z,WRErwin1,Very useful,Good way to identify foods high in protein or any other nutrient that interests you. Nice that vegetarians and vegans can limit searches just to foods that meet their requirements.
247,247,5,2013-04-09T04:25:11.000Z,kcsenar,Good app!,Great app! Though I would purchase if it allowed me to find nutritional value for a homemade meal using the food database already loaded in.
248,248,5,2013-04-17T05:23:24.000Z,Awesome short stories,Great!,"Great app! Specially to nutritionist, when a patient ask for some random ingredient we don't know all its values! Works like a lucky charm!"
249,249,4,2017-03-14T11:45:39.000Z,auntielynn,One more thing,"Need food gram number measurements in addition to daily percentages for carb tracking, etc. Also ½ frank for calorie watching. More later..."
250,250,4,2011-09-08T01:59:30.000Z,EddieFourPaws,Pretty good,"I would like to see more dairy, specifically yogurt...plain, fat/fat free, greek, etc."
251,251,5,2011-12-14T23:13:54.000Z,annamagnerxo,Easy,This app makes everything about food easy to learn!!!!! I love this!

255,255,5,2012-06-18T20:44:57.000Z,Womanized,Best app ever!,Every thing you need to know about your food. Great for diabetics... Any one who wants to know what real food contains.
256,256,5,2012-10-03T00:47:34.000Z,SuzyShopper,Great!,Very helpful app for tracking ones health using various nutritional information.
257,257,4,2012-10-06T12:17:49.000Z,Muse 2 pharaoh,Great app,"I really like this app! It's informative, & I use it daily. I wanted to give it 5 stars but I feel like it's missing a few items like collard greens & chia seeds. I really like this app."
258,258,5,2016-04-09T15:32:11.000Z,peterparker62,Handy,"Love it. Wish it had details on fatty acids, but otherwise everything I need."
259,259,4,2016-11-23T05:38:32.000Z,Mholms,Love the details!,Great for tracking those detailed nutrient needs EXCEPT would love to see a way to add your own items and supplements!
260,260,4,2011-04-17T17:09:29.000Z,yedusany,Relatively Useful,"This should be two stars but since all of the other nutritional apps on here are so useless, I gave it four stars. It is the best one."
261,261,2,2011-06-13T22:13:03.000Z,galinam,"It's OK, but........","The concept is great, but there are many foods that are missing (pasta, for example). Paying for categories is ridiculous, but I would not even have a problem with that if the food list was more elaborate."
262,262,3,2011-06-17T17:35:54.000Z,legumeater,questionable...,at first I was impressed... then I looked up green beans. I question the accuracy of the data. green beans really have 46 g fiber per cup? not sure about that. now I wonder if the rest of the data is accurate...
263,263,4,2011-06-19T14:50:10.000Z,itsaflower,Very informative app,I find the app to have slot of good info I use it with my other app to keep track of my food and calories. Thanks
264,264,4,2012-06-02T19:43:31.000Z,PJ Santa Fe,Well designed,Useful app with direct access to wikipedia. I would recommend adding more detailed unsaturated info about oils.
265,265,4,2012-06-24T23:01:56.000Z,Panyan2333444,Nutrient,"I love the site. It has a lot valuable information, however I think 1.99 is a little pricey for just one nutrient"
266,266,3,2012-12-25T21:25:41.000Z,Purplestarz42,Could be better,"This App has great potential, with vast information on most food, but did not get 5 stars from me because it missed the basics such as categories for bread, cereal, snacks ect."
267,267,5,2013-05-02T02:29:09.000Z,Whatrix,Unreal!,An embarrassment of riches! The most thorough and complete nutrition atlas I have ever seen! If you want to know what you eat I strongly suggest this Greta app!
268,268,5,2015-06-04T00:05:21.000Z,Carb Guy,Carbs,"For someone who counts carbs all the time, this app saves me alot of time and helps with my diet.  This a great app. Thank You"
269,269,3,2017-05-01T21:10:38.000Z,Octocroco,Want to add items,I think Centrum Multivitamins should be listed so can be added to the Journal to know that those vitamins have been taken. I do not see a way to add it myself.
270,270,2,2011-04-23T04:00:26.000Z,Quintessence137,Ms.,"Not enough foods and not enough information. Should include everything in the food; antioxidants, phytochemicals, etc. And also please include information about how each vitamin and mineral is good for you and how much of it one should consume.

271,271,5,2011-05-20T00:23:07.000Z,Vviti,Very pleased.,This app is quite good. Easy to use. Highly recommend.

274,274,1,2013-02-18T05:39:14.000Z,Tokemusic,Very Limited,"This is a bait and switch app. The information is very limited and you have to spend quite a bit of money to get much use from this app. I have removed it after about 5 minutes. No beef steak, no bacon and why is it in grams? Useless."
275,275,5,2013-03-01T03:41:07.000Z,Mzad7,Love it!!,Absolutely love this site even if I did pay $1.99 to look up nutrients.
276,276,3,2013-07-21T14:09:26.000Z,Old scrabble player,Better then average,You have great breakdown of foods but the bottom line wish you would add many more food to our list
277,277,3,2015-12-11T08:13:38.000Z,A Piece of Cod,Pretty solid basics,"But needs a journal that can at least compute each day's total intake of macronutrients. As it stands, it's a decent reference tool but the journal feature is not yet useful."
278,278,4,2016-02-09T08:15:48.000Z,PansKnight,Great app,Gives you a lot of information on what's in the food you eat.
279,279,4,2016-02-29T11:28:53.000Z,SPerry1975,Great app,"This app is helpful for finding out nutrient levels of foods, but they need to continue to work on the varieties of fruits, vegetables, etc."
280,280,3,2011-04-14T23:42:19.000Z,Zenmommy,"Good, but needs updating","Decent app, but needs to update the food bank. For, there is no information on pork of any kind. Not bad over all though."
281,281,4,2011-06-14T21:55:24.000Z,I_<3_Jesus,Nutrition,Very useful app. I hope in the future you can compare foods and see nutritious ways to make substitutions.
282,282,1,2011-10-13T18:52:20.000Z,Badappattack,Inaccurate,"It displays chicken as having 21 carbs in a half chicken breast?!?! Nuff said! ... for all those people who know anything about nutrition, you know as well as I do that chicken is mostly protein and most all foods that are high in protein are low in carbs, especially meats. On this discrepancy alone this app deserve a bad rating."
283,283,3,2011-12-24T03:26:34.000Z,Juan Summer,Crashes frequently,"The concept is awesome, great app idea, but it's missing lot of foods and it crashes all the time, it's seriously annoying."
284,284,3,2012-01-26T02:24:13.000Z,Aquapup,Decent but some issues,"Would be nice to have serving sizes in ounces as well as grams...American items are typically sold by ounces. Also the beam stats are off, by approximately a factor of ten. Green beans are NOT 300+ calories per serving!!"
285,285,4,2012-02-07T03:32:42.000Z,angryshark,Okay,"Lots of data, looks nice. Crashes and is sometimes tough to navigate."
286,286,5,2012-12-08T05:44:57.000Z,Wondermetal,Great app for nutritionist,"Easy to navigate through, database of common natural food and what they offer!!! ...I love it!"

288,288,5,2014-12-02T02:52:14.000Z,not-a-lady-of-leisure,Terrific app!,Love this app. It has tons of information in very clear formats. Use it a lot.
289,289,1,2017-01-31T05:11:54.000Z,Vargas26,Worst App Ever,This is the absolute worst app. I paid 4.99 to use this app to calculate my nutrition facts for my recipes. It didn't even have simple products in the database for me to calculate. No cups or tablespoons not even servings. You cannot calculate anything right with this app. Best to not waste your money.
290,290,2,2011-06-22T08:28:46.000Z,Kdub22,This app blows and so does the add on fees,I was hoping that it would calculate what I ate for the day but it's more like a reference guide. There are a lot of calorie/fat calculators but I can't seem to find one that adds up all the vitamins and minerals intake.
291,291,4,2011-07-12T00:05:44.000Z,Izyya,Good app,Very useful for finding info about foods. Really like that you can select the amount/portion size.
292,292,3,2011-08-04T23:38:47.000Z,TimMcFarland,Needs work,"Nice interface. Very pretty. Good information. Many things left out, including Halibut, bacon, sour cream, tuna..."
293,293,3,2012-04-23T05:22:47.000Z,Need to include beef and pork,.,I think it's odd that they list odd meats like bear and elk but the only listings for beef and pork are for ground. I would like to see some more beef and pork choices otherwise I think it's a great app
294,294,4,2013-02-12T02:24:11.000Z,Not yet Fit,Give me time,I've barely opened the app - too soon to ask form a rating
295,295,1,2013-02-19T22:38:49.000Z,katbrain,Umm...bait & switch?!,"Seems nice enough, but when I try to look up which foods are, say, high in iron, it requires $1.99 to unlock. But get this, you have to pay $1.99 for EACH nutrient and mineral. (There are 30 items total.) That's $60 to ""unlock"" all info. No thanks."
296,296,1,2013-06-06T23:09:20.000Z,gniuxiao,Every basic feature needs money,"You have to buy every feature in this app, no matter how simple and basic the feature is, such as ""add to favorite"", ""search by nutrient"" etc."
297,297,4,2013-07-07T22:43:01.000Z,RHKona,Great app!,Very convenient! I use it a lot! Has a good selection of foods but could always use more.
298,298,2,2015-01-10T01:32:56.000Z,Kolennina,Useless for me,"Is only would worth my money if I could keep a record on my daily food consumption, otherwise I can check it all on a google search but for free."
299,299,5,2015-12-29T18:13:38.000Z,Flower purple,Foodie,An excellent source of finding details of food you like
300,300,3,2010-11-03T04:22:09.000Z,TefiTup,Depends,I think this app is useful especially if you're a beginner. It just doesn't have many of the foods that exist. It's only the basic. Good idea tho.
301,301,2,2011-06-21T01:30:03.000Z,Rozztone,Foodie,Much of the info is data driven. Hard to tell what is relevant about the  portions of fish.  Links to wikipidia r not accurate. Info that is here is useful yet still not extensive and I will not pay for partial info.
302,302,5,2012-07-18T20:19:39.000Z,daisy4904,Great,Love this App! My kids love to learn about fruit and veggies and this App has great information.
303,303,4,2013-01-02T03:37:19.000Z,PurEmageNation,Wonderful App!,Just downloaded this App and am very pleased. It's loaded with very useful nutritional information on so many foods.
304,304,5,2013-01-18T19:22:54.000Z,:)(:),Just what I wanted,User friendly and a good source for food facts.

306,306,1,2013-02-26T13:52:52.000Z,Debleavic,Awful,Thought i could categorize foods by category.  ie..list carbohydrates in order from high to low.
307,307,5,2013-06-04T17:46:54.000Z,Aberadwan,Very good app,I recommend that app for every one it's very helpful .
308,308,3,2015-03-22T19:39:10.000Z,-0112358-,Has limitations,"This app is great in principle, but is missing some common foods from its database. You can't add custom foods yourself, so the app is needlessly limited. I'm fairly disappointed."
309,309,1,2016-06-23T01:13:19.000Z,Pink.5,hate it for recipe building,"just paid for this app, only to discover it's extremely limited food library. when inputting ingredients to calculate nutrition facts of a homemade meal, I found it nearly incomprehensible. don't waste your money like I did."
310,310,5,2010-11-27T21:01:51.000Z,Ali729,Love it,I use it all the time to ensure that I am keeping a healthy and balanced diet

313,313,3,2011-08-13T17:01:27.000Z,AJSchroyer50,My food,So far so good.  Although I don't like that you have to purchase each section separately
314,314,5,2011-12-11T22:53:49.000Z,GemüseV,iVegan,This app makes being a vegan so much easier. <3
315,315,4,2012-05-21T13:52:05.000Z,Loollkjhjmn,Missing one thing...,"Good app, however needs to include monounsaturated fat content."
316,316,5,2012-09-17T12:10:23.000Z,The Good Life Tools,Very deep,"Finally an app that goes all the way with nutritional info; we need to monitor potassium, manganese, vitamins such as  E & K."
317,317,5,2012-12-06T12:28:25.000Z,urJeffe,Myfood,"Excellent app, love it!!"
318,318,2,2013-02-16T16:58:56.000Z,Sockmunki,Ok but many weaknesses,"It's hard to know what the sizes refer to. For foods that are cooked (for example grains, beans, oatmeal) do the values refer to 1 cup uncooked or after cooking? I haven't found it useful because of this. does 1 cup of chick peas really have 728 calories?"
319,319,2,2013-10-13T19:48:53.000Z,Omni618383,Where's the value??? Overpriced.,This app has set serving sizes so you must complete complicated calculations to find your own serving size nutrients. I do not see the value in this app. Waste of money
320,320,5,2011-05-14T19:13:56.000Z,Nena84,Superb!,Useful and easy to use. Strongly recommend it.

495,495,1,2017-12-17T15:03:12.000Z,dknj925,Confusing,This app is so confusing and complicated. Just trying to find a food is difficult. I also tried to scan a bar code on a very commercial bread and it couldn’t be found! Way too much work
496,496,2,2018-02-01T22:09:02.000Z,Anonymousrgb,Nutrients,This does not work on my iPhone. I think it was designed for Android.
497,497,2,2018-04-10T14:43:53.000Z,Faythstorm,I just wasted $5,"I wanted a food journal that logged nutrients as well as calories, that's all I wanted. This all appeared to be what I wanted."
498,498,2,2018-07-24T15:17:07.000Z,Jonesgirl3,Not great for recipes,First recipe I tried to enter I could not find an ingredient in the apps database. I did a search and bar code scan and nothing. I looked for a way to enter the ingredient manually but that doesn’t appear to be an option. I also looked for a help section or a website and again it appears neither is available. Website info I did find leads right back to the App Store so no help there. I gave it two stars because it has potential especially if you could manually or scan in a product/ingredient. But I’m really dissatisfied with what it is especially for the cost. I have purchased better apps that cost far less.
499,499,2,2021-03-07T18:17:02.000Z,Farzad-k,Kind of buggy and dysfunctional commands,"What else bugs me about this app is the list of manufactured products. If I want nutritional value of beans I don’t care about various products manufactured by companies - I just want beans. Take celery, for example. Why would I need to know nutritional value of cream of celery soup? Who knows what is inside of that? Or celery salad, I can figure out the values of a celery salad based on how I make it."
500,500,2,2011-02-16T00:38:25.000Z,Currycat,Still missing some obvious foods,"No peas, lentils,rice,oatmeal. I find"

608,608,5,2011-02-09T06:45:28.000Z,Bonzette,Great App,"This app really helps in supermarket, cooking & restaurant decision making.  I always check the calories & sugar to see if it fits for the day.

617,617,2,2011-01-25T13:52:01.000Z,Diana Bonafede Williams,Doesn't list carbs,The most important piece to dropping weight is lowering your carbs. This nutritional app doesn't provide this info.
618,618,2,2011-01-29T21:17:52.000Z,Mikemorgan1949,Ah,Not enough info
619,619,2,2011-01-30T14:05:41.000Z,q3erfqdf,Nice start,Needs customizable serving sizes
620,620,3,2011-01-09T12:33:18.000Z,Anna g13,Sorta helpful,If you want to be thin and healthy get it
621,621,1,2011-01-10T08:19:49.000Z,dsh313,Insufficient,Just nutrition info about foods that can be found anywhere. You could probably just find a website on your phone and save it to your favorites and it would be just the same as this app.
622,622,1,2011-01-10T22:21:23.000Z,MsRuby,Less than basic,Great idea.... Just not a complete idea!!!
623,623,2,2011-01-11T11:34:23.000Z,123xyx123,Not good enough...,"Good concept, but lacking many basic items. Also would be nice if you could sort by value. For instance, sort by ""vitamin A"" and have all the foods rich in that vitamin list. Can't wait to check back for an update on this app"
624,624,5,2011-01-12T02:53:47.000Z,My food,Awesome,This app is awesome I can see how many calories are in the food I eat
625,625,5,2011-01-14T21:08:46.000Z,miggy99,Great,This is a very nice application.
626,626,5,2011-01-14T22:36:47.000Z,Bj.daniels,Awesome,"I just did the download and took a look at it....like I said it's awesome it has all the fruit & vegetable it has a range of serving sizes I am impressed, and the to top it off IT'S FREE!!!!!. I compared it to some of the pay apps and their reviews....this is the 1 I'm emailing my daughter as soon as I finish this review. Get It, I wouldn't steer you wrong."
627,627,4,2011-01-17T13:10:00.000Z,Lisaanne:69,Informative,It provides a good resource

629,629,3,2011-01-20T01:38:43.000Z,IH8Zonists,Not enough stuff,Wheres the eggs?
630,630,2,2010-12-19T15:40:29.000Z,Lipperplump,Ehh...,"It's ok:/ I like it but you need to put all foods in there like meat,breakfast foods like biscuit cereal, so yeah please try and change that."
631,631,4,2010-12-21T15:42:40.000Z,Spare rib,Good start,Should include serving size and more food groups. But a good start.
632,632,4,2010-12-25T22:35:14.000Z,Exit Right,Good beginning!,"Very nice app, easy to use and find what you are seeking.  Keep up the good work, This site is a good beginning."
633,633,2,2010-12-27T14:55:16.000Z,Lil rawr,Not the best app.,Umm not what I thought....
634,634,4,2010-12-29T02:48:56.000Z,hanban,It's almost there,"I love how it has the vitamin content and the sugar content, and this app doesn't focus on the calorie content as much which I surely like, as I'm not worried about that stuff! But... It only has fruits, vegetables, cheese, and fish... If it had meat and grains, this app would be top notch! Great layout- interesting, easy to follow, and colorful."
635,635,5,2010-12-29T18:02:36.000Z,Jessica Bath,This app is so cool!,I love it how it shows all the minerals and vitamins each food has. Makes me want to be a calorie counter. Having wikipedia makes it 10 times better :) props to pom apps!
636,636,5,2010-12-31T00:09:11.000Z,Honest_Weasel,Great app,Love this app. My kids and I look at the nutritious value of what we are eating. Hope to see Turnip in the next update.
637,637,4,2010-12-31T04:38:45.000Z,Slevitoo,Food app,"Very good and easy to use.  I would like to see meats and cereals too, and maybe baked goods.  But for what's listed this is great!  I particularly like being able to pick the amount to get the readout on - ie - 1 strawberry or a cup of strawberries or a 1 inch cube of cheese or a cup of shredded cheese."
638,638,5,2011-01-03T22:28:34.000Z,ckkc16,Cool!,"We are doing the food pyramid and I wish that it had mire from the meat group and the grains group also the sweets, oils, and fats group otherwise it awesome!!!!!"
639,639,4,2011-01-08T04:09:38.000Z,Jess bikinis,Awesome,Awesome!
640,640,1,2010-12-09T02:14:17.000Z,RRME,Not enough info or useful,Not enough info or useful
641,641,4,2010-12-12T03:48:02.000Z,Rick from Wichita,Good info,"Perfect for finding veggie info, just wish more veggies and fruits were listed, like garlic!"
642,642,3,2010-12-15T03:14:28.000Z,Jesse Parker,Hmmm,There's no serving size...

646,646,5,2011-03-12T12:50:34.000Z,Addy06,Addy06,THANKS!
647,647,5,2014-06-08T17:31:26.000Z,tagger9,Very nice app,"I really like this app for getting quick and useful nutrition info on most foods you will eat. Goes way beyond what grocery store labels give you. Based on the USDA nutrition database. Works great on iPad Air, iOS 7."
648,648,4,2015-01-07T18:48:01.000Z,jschuric,Great App,This is a great app.  If it had a bar code reader it would be near perfect as a food register and journal.
649,649,2,2016-08-02T14:22:32.000Z,chaering,Good for free,Update: this app is falling behind other apps due to a limited food database and lack of bar code scanning.
650,650,5,2011-04-28T15:14:49.000Z,namasteaquari,AWESOME!,Having the free app and using it almost every day there was no hesitation paying $2.97 for the additional features on the new update. Not only is this app beautifully rendered but this app is very informative. This is IMHO the best food app out there. A effin plus
651,651,5,2011-07-03T01:56:20.000Z,blessedtammy,great,great software.Easy check and good for healthy lose weight!
652,652,5,2011-12-19T10:58:58.000Z,Sharybuldeo,Mrs,"Very informative, detailed info.useless though if you have no intention of counting calories."
653,653,5,2013-05-01T20:46:27.000Z,Deen1stApps,Best app ever,Love it! The update is amazing.Very informative app. Especially if you are trying to eat healthier or get more of one type of nutrient. You can eat more of that type of food.
