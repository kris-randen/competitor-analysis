0,0,5,2019-07-14T19:05:39.000Z,Hubert Aruba,Exceeded my expectations,"After searching for a while for a reliable app that I can use to record both my blood pressure and glucose level, I decided to try this one out. After 3 days of using and testing it, I was so amazed at the marvelous graphs, presentations and reporting details that I decided to go for a 6 months premium membership. I am very pleased with this app. It has truly exceeded my expectations. Very professional and well designed product indeed!"
1,1,5,2019-01-25T14:01:51.000Z,I got it right,Great tool,Recently I had a visit to my doctor that suggested I needed to monitor my blood pressure my weight and my glucose levels having never done that before I was a little low on sure as to how to proceed. This particular app does it well does it simply and gives me all the information I need to give to my doctor
2,2,3,2021-04-27T02:11:58.000Z,L to tha IZETE,Finally - an app that tracks it all!,"I have been tracking blood sugars, food, weight, exercise, etc. all manually and in different apps. This app does it all now with the exception of it not syncing with my smart watch. It’s super simple to use, the layout isn’t too feature heavy and I can easily share data with others (apparently there’s a limit to how many times I can share with the free version). Customer service is non-existent and offers no support when needed, and is why I’m not giving this the full 5 stars."
3,3,5,2019-11-19T02:34:32.000Z,Sheshowdew,Easy and intuitive!,"Have used several apps for tracking my Glucose and Blood Pressure! With automatic Bluetooth sync and easy notes, this is far and away the best that I’ve tried. Love the pdf reports as well for the trips to my doctor! Bought the 6 month and will renew each time!"
4,4,5,2017-10-01T13:58:45.000Z,Fisrtgent,New user,I am new to this device and app but from what I can see it covers all my recording needs. This eliminates me using two apps for recording information. I enjoy using this app which allows me to sync up with my laptop to send information to my doctor.
5,5,4,2020-02-29T16:14:34.000Z,TubaJim,Very disappointed - OK Now,I’m wondering how this app got such a high rating. I can not complete the setup on an iPhone 11. No keyboard comes up in the Personalization section. There appears to be no way email them on their website - the Submit button never activates.
6,6,5,2018-01-27T14:47:31.000Z,Tony 987654321,Easiest app out there!,"This is by far the best BG app I’ve found.  I’ve installed and looked at 9 others and Health2Sync is like taking my favorite parts of each and rolling them all together.  Reports are easy to send. Input is a breeze, and it even syncs to my meter via Bluetooth."
7,7,5,2020-05-10T03:32:29.000Z,dfhyrax,Love this app!,"I have type 1 diabetes and this is the first app that is easy to use and gives me the information I need in a simple format. Plus I love that I can enter my sugars in myself, rather than syncing with the monitor. This is truly a life saver for me!"
8,8,2,2017-10-07T16:58:09.000Z,drumswithcats,Bad form to gut your free version in order to force subscription purchase,I see that you have crippled your reporting function With the creation of your premium subscription. I will be leaving and I’ll be taking all of my diabetic family members with me into another application. It’s not OK to cripple the free version that people are using. I’d have been happy to pay for the premium version with added features had you not done so.
9,9,1,2020-09-06T15:38:33.000Z,Texas OD,Terms of use agreement,"After downloading this app I plowed through the terms of use agreement. After 15 minutes of reading, I finally came to the hold harmless, indemnification clause."
10,10,3,2017-10-17T19:27:57.000Z,"Joe O., Texas",Love the app,"I love the app, but won’t pay a monthly fee for it. Out of all the paid services, the only one I would use is pdf print. Maybe come up with a separate one time fee to add that feature."
11,11,3,2017-10-20T02:48:14.000Z,JuanCaceres,Access as doctor,I just write an email to control my patients on the web interface but received no answer... some email which we can write to have answer?
12,12,5,2018-01-20T13:24:04.000Z,d9dunn,Great device!,Syncs with meter so all readings show up dated and with notes!  Awesome device to keep track of everything easily.
13,13,5,2018-03-25T09:58:16.000Z,Saevalist,Easy to use,This is the best way that I have found to track blood glucose.
14,14,5,2018-04-20T21:44:01.000Z,sandy63050,Health 2 sync,Just started using app. So far I really like it.  Haven’t tried everything yet
15,15,1,2019-01-14T12:28:56.000Z,Tarbuck2006,User Name and Password Issues,My wife recently changed phones and had to download the app again.  She forgot her password.  Have tried to request reset link from developer 3 times and have not gotten a response.  Why can I not get someone to send me the reset link?  Very frustrating.
16,16,5,2020-06-10T19:55:24.000Z,ar-niteowl,Wow,I am so glad I stumbled upon this app!  It is by far the best app I’ve used to track BG.  It is very stable and response is quick.  Syncs well with my meter.  I love that I can track other data as well and the trends and graphs are just what I needed!
17,17,5,2020-02-26T04:47:34.000Z,bil4492,Great app,Been using for 2 months now and it was very easy and intuitive to get started and use. Very easy to input data and not overly complicated. I would highly recommend!
18,18,5,2021-03-03T01:56:05.000Z,1B8m1g,One stop shop.,"I love that I can track EVERYTHING on one app.  I haven’t tried the reports yet, but I’m confident that they will be great by the way the app is easy to use.  Thank You.  Brenda"
19,19,3,2020-04-20T12:44:36.000Z,plsalford,Confusing,"I am finding this app a little confusing.  Like meds.  I take a lot of meds.  Do you want all my meds or just my diabetes med, that is not clear. I also cannot find some of them.  I just feel like I am flying blind on how to use this app."
20,20,4,2017-12-07T18:12:53.000Z,TECHMARX,Food,I can not locate space to record what food I ate the night before.  App seems easy to navigate!
21,21,5,2018-02-14T14:25:32.000Z,Ej Jane,Great app,"When my daughter showed me how to use it, it’s been great, use it every day"
22,22,4,2018-03-27T01:25:39.000Z,N8ZKA,Health2Sync,I like the app and it tracks everything I want. I’ve had a little trouble learning to use it but I think that’s me.
23,23,4,2018-06-11T12:42:03.000Z,Papapat1,Good way to control weight and glucose,I find that by recording my daily activity I watch my caloric and sugar intake and as a result I’ve lost 7 pounds and lowered my average glucose count.
24,24,5,2018-12-05T18:12:25.000Z,miguelpr,Diabetes. Control,Helps me have trusted numbers for diabetes control
25,25,4,2019-02-28T15:56:40.000Z,Turnip Threat,Easy to use,Needed something to track my bg and this is perfect.
26,26,5,2019-04-07T10:24:25.000Z,g57cash,Best app out there,Best out there even my doctor wants to use it for his other patients
27,27,3,2019-05-12T13:25:09.000Z,ezyxyz,Download data,"Should be able to download data without a monthly charge, maybe a one time fee. Otherwise I like the app."
28,28,1,2020-08-15T13:11:38.000Z,MDL1022,Broke an excellent app!,"This used to be a great app, but they added so much complexity in clicking through screens to just add a reading! The latest version requires multiple screen clicks to just add a reading! Bring back the previous version! It worked great!"
29,29,1,2020-02-28T03:29:57.000Z,Modern Jess,Spammy Notifications,I made the mistake of allowing notifications for this app. Now the app is spamming me with promotional notifications.
30,30,5,2017-09-29T13:48:06.000Z,Grams1000,Blood test results,I like the simplicity and thoroughness of this app.

34,34,5,2018-08-02T00:26:27.000Z,gurkamighty,Second mother,Good group like a 24 hrs 7day mom lol
35,35,3,2018-10-04T07:10:46.000Z,GramereC,No units for medication,Does not have a way to enter units of insulin. So the medication portion is not useful at all for insulin dependent type 1.
36,36,5,2018-12-18T14:02:32.000Z,misgabby,Health2Sync,Very easy to use
37,37,5,2019-01-04T16:52:27.000Z,AbhiGullz,Perfect Blood Glucose Monitoring app,This is a perfect app for monitoring blood glucose and keeping the track of it.

39,39,4,2019-07-07T01:28:24.000Z,raylew1950,Ray Lew,Only app I use to track Blood Glucose. My Doctor like the 90 day averages.
40,40,5,2016-01-16T18:10:22.000Z,BikePunkmaggie,Great app,"I have been testing a few apps over the past year, not sure how I missed this app. So far, it beats the other apps."
41,41,5,2016-03-16T06:16:37.000Z,ItReallyHappened8899,Seems decent!,Just grabbed this and trying it out. My doctor wants me to keep a log for a week or so with my fingersticks but also what I eat and my mood and so on. It seems to have all I need fir that. Plus I can email her a PDF of my progress and notes! Looks like a perfect app for what I was tasked to do!
42,42,5,2016-05-24T15:06:25.000Z,Dark park1980,Best app,This is all In one app that helps trade weight vitals and your blood sugar after a loved one had triple bypass and had diabetes and I had to do round clock checks  I could print out the pdf from email and give to all doctors they loved the data keeping made there job easier so yes this app is the best app out there....... Thanks health2sync
43,43,5,2016-06-24T00:19:53.000Z,designrox1103,"Tracking Weight, Glucose and BP",It's important to use something like this app to track your blood pressure wait in glucose. Since this did all 3+ let you add the medications that you check the type of food that you ate and additional notes as necessary;  This application has been very helpful in doing so.

Blood pressure, weight, activity, food and blood glucose. This app has all that and more. I love the photo diary element! Great design thinking!"
54,54,2,2017-01-09T06:47:20.000Z,Okayhey,Wasn't crazy about it,"You can easily dismiss the notifications if you need to open your phone for another purpose, so it can be kinda useless in terms of providing a reminder to check. It's also confusing to set which times you measure your blood sugar."
55,55,5,2017-03-12T21:56:13.000Z,StanJaxsr,Stan,"This site helps to inform me how my diet effects my BG & BP. I've made it part of my routine to test twice per day and enter results quickly without writing. I'm planning to sync my meter when I purchase the cable. Try it, it is FREE, help yourself & your doctor. Entry of results is easy."
56,56,5,2017-06-03T13:19:17.000Z,DiscoveryBound,Finally found the one!,"So glad to find an easy to use quality product, I'm a believer!  If the developers add features for a small fee, I'm actually willing to pay.  That's a rarity as I've only purchased 3 apps in the last 15 years and only use one of them to date."
57,57,5,2017-06-12T21:35:53.000Z,Cherylawol,Does what you need,This does weight. Glucose. Blood pressure.  And suns with apple iPhone health. There is a good. Daily goal. Meter sync. A journal.
