0,0,4,2019-01-15T17:52:19.000Z,cprado23,Edit* improved,Edit**** the developers heard our concerns the glitches have been fixed. Since it‚Äôs a new app there‚Äôs always room for improvement. Some exercises are missing equipment needed before it starts. For example there‚Äôs some workouts where I‚Äôve needed a mat since there‚Äôs floor stretching but it didn‚Äôt have it in the equipment needed. But it do enjoy that the model doing the exercises is the same stage of pregnancy as I am to ensure the safety of the movements.
1,1,4,2021-04-13T01:58:09.000Z,lobabill,Repetitive but good for keeping you on track,I couldn‚Äôt decide if I should give 3 or 4 stars.  Here‚Äôs what I like: the tracking feature.  You are given a set number of workouts to complete in a week (I have mine set to four because I like to run/walk in addition to using this app).  The set number of workouts to check off my list keeps me motivated.  I like the pelvic floor exercises because otherwise I‚Äôd never do them.  There are also other features like audio workouts (I suppose people use these at the gym as opposed to watching along with the video) and you can always search and do more than your recommended weekly workouts.
2,2,3,2020-04-20T14:30:43.000Z,CoriiSuee,"Excited for this app, annoyed with loading pauses","I was so excited to find this app and have purchased the premium and been using it for a week now, but in the middle of the workouts the exercise will simply stop loading and I‚Äôm sitting waiting for it while my heart rate slows and I lose the burn. At first I figured out that if I click on the next movement it will load more quickly SOMETIMES, but mainly it just glitches more.  Another day I tried to let it ‚Äúload‚Äù aka sit for 30 minutes before I even click play to begin the daily workout, but that didn‚Äôt work either. I use 5G WiFi and have no issues with slow connection in the house, I have deleted the app and re-downloaded it and re-started my phone to troubleshoot at no avail. If this one glitch would be fixed I would be happy to rate this app a 5 star! The workouts are challenging and easy to follow along, and I love being able to track my progress. I do wish I could track what I eat in the ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù but I just had to download a separate app for that. I am a single mother and a lot of the recipes do not seem budget friendly, but the recipes are listed and arranged to make them so simple! I do hope to try some of them as my pregnancy progresses. All in all it is a very cool app!!"
3,3,3,2020-05-26T03:10:17.000Z,Alessandra Hirai,"Repetitive exercises, not exactly designed for pregnant women","I subscribed this app as an option for a home workout during my pregnancy and quarantine period. I added my goal of exercising 4 days a week for about 30-40min. At the beginning I noticed that the videos was always crashing, so an exercise plan of 40 minutes normally takes longer as it restart the whole exercise. The plans are pretty similar, over and over, and not only there is a slim model on the videos (not a pregnant woman on an exercise app designed for pregnant women) but also a bunch of lunges for example and other exercises not really good or comfortable for 20+ weeks pregnancy. There is a huge amount of repetitive exercises during a pla. I‚Äôm 23 weeks pregnant and it has increasing the number of lunges and other extreme exercises as well as sending longer plans (47 minutes). They offer repetitive shorter options in case you wanna reduce your time, but really, same exercises all the time! I will not continue with my subscription and I‚Äôm extremely disappointed! Do not recommend!"
4,4,3,2019-02-15T16:38:49.000Z,2222344556,Good exercises but long awkward video pauses,"I downloaded the app for the workouts and really new to the app, but first impressions are.... the exercises are great, but the transitions between each exercise are awkward. While the video example is great to have, they just start way too late! There seems to be a long pause where the model isn‚Äôt doing anything, like she‚Äôs almost waiting for the voice over to explain before she starts, so by the time she shows you what to do, half the time of the exercise clock has run out. I‚Äôd recommend the model should already be in action doing the exercise routine right from the second the time starts (not 5-10 seconds in). I also think the cool down is too long (almost as long as the main session, I‚Äôd rather send more time in the main session. I‚Äôm going to keep using the app for now and see if I get use to the awkward pauses and maybe as I get further along I‚Äôll appreciate them, but for not completely sold in this so look at other options too."
5,5,2,2020-05-09T11:20:39.000Z,cstell12345,Limited Variation and ability to customize,"I was excited to have an app to lead me through home workouts during pregnancy especially during quarantine. At the start (in second trimester), I was enjoying the app overall. My biggest complaint was that I didn‚Äôt feel I was getting enough cardio and there is no way (so far as I can tell) to customize the workout type (eg have more  cardio routines to select from in a given week) apart from repeating a workout. As the weeks have gone on, as other reviewers have noted, it seems the exercises are just recycled ‚ÄîI‚Äôm doing the same exercises I have been, perhaps just in different order, for several weeks without any new additions mixed in. In addition, the trainer in the video barely appears pregnant so in my third trimester I‚Äôm following someone that has a lot more range of mobility etc. it seems for a pregnancy dedicated app, the very least it could do would be to film instructors at about the appropriate prenatal stage...  there is a lot of room for improvement and I don‚Äôt feel I will continue with the app beyond the initial period I‚Äôve already paid for."
6,6,3,2020-04-03T12:51:51.000Z,lydiawwwhite,"Nice holistic start, could be more accessible and add more tracking","I am using the app primarily for workouts and pelvic floor exercises. I don‚Äôt have much at-home exercise equipment so I have to do a ton of modifications. It would be nice if there were more exercises that didn‚Äôt rely on special equipment or large exercise balls. In terms of UX, the pelvic floor exercises are buried in the overflow menu instead of accessible from home screen. And it would be nice to have more granular control over notifications."
7,7,2,2018-08-01T15:55:42.000Z,TMammoser,Seems Unfinished...,"I, at first, fell in love with this app for the weekly circuit workouts. They were a perfect addition to walking and yoga during my pregnancy. However, there isn‚Äôt sound and they don‚Äôt include transition time in between exercises so I had to be prepared to makeup those missed reps later. Well, now in my third trimester the circuits stopped. Are they not done creating them yet? So now I‚Äôve tried using the MyFitnessStudio portion and the workout orders are not correct. Today I did a workout that went from warm-up, to cool down, and then the workout. Do the creators not test these out before they post them? Also who creates these workouts? One had a lot of bridge exercises so I was on my back for a long time and then there was reclined twists which can be unsafe. I hope they have certified instructors creating these workouts because women are trusting you. Review your own app Baby2Body so you know you are charging women for the app you are intending to give them."
8,8,2,2020-04-13T22:43:18.000Z,stardus2020,"Too few exercises, not enough variety","I‚Äôd purchased the membership primarily so that I can get a variety of prenatal workouts in and now that I‚Äôve used it for a couple of months, I can say that there is definitely room for improvement."
9,9,2,2018-06-30T02:31:36.000Z,ËçâËéìÂ®úÂ®ú,App looks great... but most everything is locked until u pay,"I was really excited about this app and wanted to try it out. In my experience ‚Äúin-app‚Äù purchase apps still have some functionality without purchasing. And they let you test drive parts of the locked stuff to see if you like it before giving your billing info and having to cancel later. Very disappointed in this as you can‚Äôt do much of anything on the app unless you sign up for a 7 day free trial. And everything you click on leads back to a page asking for $7/mo. Makes it seem like a money grabbing app, not one out to support moms to be and their well-being. I would recommend ‚Äúwhat to expect‚Äù app if ur going to pay. At least they don‚Äôt seem like they‚Äôre reaching in your pocket every 10sec."
10,10,3,2018-01-30T20:19:52.000Z,Laurenvieira,Don‚Äôt waste your time unless you want to purchase,"The only reason I‚Äôm giving three stars is because the app is gorgeous and I‚Äôm sure its great once you purchase it. I‚Äôm trying to save as much as possible before our baby comes and spending $7/mo on an app isn‚Äôt worth it for me, regardless of how good the app is. I thought the free version would at least have some functionality but it‚Äôs a total waste of time. All of the content is locked until you purchase. It would be great if this app had at least some features that made the free version worth keeping. I downloaded it and immediately deleted it unfortunately."
11,11,5,2019-04-22T15:58:26.000Z,bellablaze19,Love It !,"Becoming a mom-to-be for the very first time is an amazing roller coaster ride . The amount of apps I have downloaded for this baby are definitely in the double digits but I have deleted some of them , I kept this one around because it‚Äôs the full package ! There‚Äôs Zen breathing which I just began doing ( it really helps ) , meal and recipe ideas , and full workouts ( did one today ! üí™üèæ broke a sweat and I felt amazing ) designed to your fitness level . You get a lot for it to be a free app but you get even more with the in app purchases ! I recommend this app to anybody that‚Äôs on their way to motherhood"
12,12,4,2019-10-01T15:31:42.000Z,ReginaPhalange93,Mostly Good,"I just downloaded today and I‚Äôm obsessed. However, I wish there was a way to add journal entities from previous weeks to the app. I‚Äôve been using Ovia and a journal app combined thus far and wish I could just add the information from those apps in previous weeks to this one and solely rely on this app from here on out. But I feel like I have to keep the other ones so I can remember how the first few weeks went. Maybe there‚Äôs a way to do this and I haven‚Äôt seen it yet but I feel like I‚Äôve searched all around. For example, I‚Äôd like to add my pictures from weeks 4 and 5 instead of starting at week 6."
13,13,5,2020-06-30T01:32:06.000Z,OpryFit,Download now mama‚Äôs,"I started this app during my second trimester and it was def worth the investment! Each week you get 4 workouts with 4-5 bonus workouts If you want to do more! I also love the weekly recipes and daily bites of information. You can also log your weight and water intake too. Looking forward to continuing this even post pregnancy as well. If you download this def use it to your advantage this app has so much to offer. I wish it had an option to save workouts, that‚Äôs the only thing other than that it‚Äôs great!"
14,14,5,2020-06-15T15:35:27.000Z,Metz Brown,This app keeps you motivated,"This app is amazing for pregnant women feeling lost on what things to eat, which work outs are safe, and it keeps you wanting to stay on track! It‚Äôs super important to eat healthy to FEEL good. Specially in the first trimester. Which in my opinion it‚Äôs the worst time during pregnancy because hormones can really take a toll on how you feel. I feel extremely tired and sick if I don‚Äôt work out and get good foods in my body, so this app teaches you different recipes that will help you through ‚Äúmorning sickness‚Äù which is all day sickness for me."
15,15,5,2019-10-07T21:44:16.000Z,shellster129,Easy to follow workouts,"It‚Äôs tough to dig through all the prenatal apps out there, but Baby2Body offers easy to follow video workouts that you can take with you on the go... to the gym, beach, living room, wherever. It can also be confusing as your pregnancy progresses to know what exercises are safe and accessible while still challenging. They tailor to your fitness level and desired frequency. I also love the pelvic floor exercise timer and recipe options. Worth paying for, but it‚Äôs great that they have free content available as well."
16,16,4,2021-04-22T06:48:21.000Z,SpicyTea18,"Great, But Also Repetitive",‚Ä¢ I like that this app has nutritional recipes for when pregnant. I think that‚Äôs a great idea and the recipes themselves taste good.
17,17,2,2021-04-16T21:43:39.000Z,preety224,Navigating through the exercises,"Good workouts, weird interface. I waste to much time navigating back and fourth from the list of workouts back to the workout. Theres a pause button that should be used for breaks when needed."
18,18,5,2020-09-10T01:11:43.000Z,kb8214jn,I love it,I absolutely love this app. I would recommend it to anyone that is pregnant for sure. I love everything about it... I would recommend if possible to add other music platforms to sync to the app as well. I love the zen den and visualizations if there were multiple visualization breathing exercises you could choose from per week that would be so nice. I‚Äôve been doing this to relax me after your recommended workout for the day and I absolutely love them. Thank you so much for creating such a wonderful app!!!!
19,19,5,2020-08-08T16:52:05.000Z,babybrain247,Great app!,"I never leave reviews but I wanted others who are considering downloading this app to know you have the option to keep this app 100% free!  they do offer premium accounts for less than a Netflix account, but they have plenty of tailored workouts and meditations to follow along with and I appreciate it SOO much. This is my first pregnancy and Fitness and well-being of me and my baby is my #1 GOAL and this app is great help and reminder for my baby brain! Download this app, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
20,20,5,2018-08-30T00:01:25.000Z,Sarah.k.Hau,Fantastic!,"I found this app during the last week of my second trimester. I am SO disappointed I did not find it sooner! As a very athletic woman trying to maintain fitness through pregnancy I was ecstatic to FINALLY find an app with real workouts that are challenging and yet safe to do. The advice and daily tips are absolutely wonderful compared to the outdated advice I found in other apps. Seriously, this app is worth every penny of the small cost."
21,21,5,2018-10-10T21:22:58.000Z,a_manderss,Love it!,"Definitely worth the $6.99 a month price tag! The ‚Äúthought of the day‚Äù quote helped me get through a lot of challenging and exhausted days during my pregnancy and postpartum period. My only complaint is that I can‚Äôt listen to music on my phone while following the workout. Makes working out at the gym a little boring since I enjoy working out to music. Overall, a great app with lots of yummy recipes, helpful tips, and great advice for staying emotionally, physically and mentally strong ‚ô•Ô∏è"
22,22,4,2018-11-05T22:23:01.000Z,PaigeNF,Love this app,Love this app! Having guided exercises for each phase of my pregnancy has been really helpful and has kept me motivated. Only downside I have is some of the transitions from one exercise to another is unrealistically fast. For example when switching to an exercise that has ankle weights it doesn‚Äôt allow you time to get ready and then the pause button doesn‚Äôt actually pause the exercise so you get behind. Overall love the app and if that was fixed it would have 5 stars!
23,23,2,2019-02-09T20:11:06.000Z,KarrahN,Bummer,"Do yourself a favor and just do the free days and write them down. Because once you buy the subscription, you‚Äôll be doing those same days over and over. I was so excited to have new content in the second trimester. I got so bored with the same workouts every week. There was two days of new stuff and then it went right back to first trimester workouts. WHY. I bought three months worth so I‚Äôll continue. Hopefully it gets better."
24,24,5,2019-03-07T10:29:40.000Z,Mama moonlove,I feeling great,"Even before I got pregnant I was trying to find a workout that wasn‚Äôt too strenuous for my back. I saw this app on an instagram Ad and checked it out, figured I would give it a try. I loveeeee it! It‚Äôs nice and short so it‚Äôs not too much, easy to fit in your schedule and great workouts to get you moving. I do it first thing in the morning and I feel stretched out and ready for the day! Thank you for this app!"
25,25,3,2019-05-24T17:03:57.000Z,Puneezzy,Love the app but needs improvement,"I have been using this app since I got pregnant and now I am in my third trimester. It has few glitches that need to be fixed specially if you are paying $10+ every month. While using the fitness studio, if you make it full screen, it looses all the time and is stuck on 34 seconds. So by the end it will show you that you have only completed 34 seconds of workout and not the actual timing. It‚Äôs kind of annoying, specially if you want to share your progress. Please look into it."
26,26,5,2019-05-26T19:58:47.000Z,New mama to be!,Love it!,I‚Äôm loving doing these workouts every morning. I‚Äôm super early in my first pregnancy and was trying to find an app that knew what I should do to stay fit and be safe for my baby! The workouts are simple but I am always starting to sweat by the end of it. Gets me in the right mind set every day! Love the recipes too :) I‚Äôve only done a few days so far and I‚Äôve noticed the warm ups are always the same. Do y‚Äôall add variety through the trimesters? Thanks for putting this together I really enjoy this app!!
27,27,5,2021-04-08T18:33:30.000Z,deevadev,Wonderful App,"Fully recommend this app!!! I used this app through my second trimester into my third. It helped me stay motivated when in my beautifully changing body. I thought I wouldn‚Äôt be ready to exercise postpartum, however, thus app is beautifully designed to move with you through recovery. I also needed to make a change to my account and received a personal response from the customer service department within 1 business day. Hooray!"
28,28,5,2021-07-13T17:37:53.000Z,nurseychelle,Stop thinking about it and get it!!!,"I absolutely love this app!  For a very reasonable fee, I‚Äôve gotten so many amazing features! Delicious and healthy recipes, a variety of very effective workouts, interesting reads about various subjects pertaining to being a mother and self care, and many ways to include self care in my very busy day. In just 2 months of dedication, I‚Äôm at my goal of weight loss. This app has also made me realize that exercise is my therapy. Thank you baby2body!!!"
29,29,4,2021-08-17T11:44:13.000Z,jbdubyeah,Good app‚Äîmissing key feature,"I did enjoy the app and would have done 5 stars, however, I dropped it to 4 stars because it does not have a function to report a pregnancy loss. Just ‚ÄúI‚Äôve conceived‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had the baby‚Äù. Miscarriage is hard enough, would be nice to have that function so I do not have to worry about pregnancy/baby related emails while I am grieving. Given statistically at least 1 in 4 women have a miscarriage, they are hurting a huge demographic."
30,30,2,2019-01-06T21:07:45.000Z,RunMocha,Fitness Studio is boring,"The concept of the mixed workouts and workout plans is cool, but the execution makes them extremely boring. Warm ups are monotonous and low energy, not enough to actually warm up. Moreover, I‚Äôve had to skip a bunch of exercises because they‚Äôre not safe for diastasis recti."
31,31,1,2019-01-10T22:41:24.000Z,Cdb14061,Subscribed and wouldn‚Äôt unlock the premium.,"Seems like a great app, but I paid for the $12 a month subscription and when I tried to click on the work outs they were still locked. I continued to try to keep buying the subscription thinking maybe it wasn‚Äôt working but it kept saying I was already subscribed??  Just confused as to why I paid and nothing was unlocking, guess it could‚Äôve been a glitch or something, but I‚Äôm not wasting my time on it."
32,32,5,2019-01-11T00:20:29.000Z,bcstu,Great app for motivation!!,"I‚Äôm really loving this app so far. I‚Äôm one week into the exercise program, and I am feeling so fantastic and proud of what I have accomplished so far. I paid for three months of the extra workout features, and I‚Äôm really glad I did. Definitely worth it. I‚Äôm enjoying the other features too like the articles and quotes. I‚Äôll be recommending this app to my pregnant friends for sure!!"
33,33,5,2019-05-02T01:51:51.000Z,Geleny rojas,OMG! Amazing!,Love this app! I hesitate it for a month to actually starting paying and now I regret it! The workouts are incredible so easy and short! As a moms we don‚Äôt have much time and all of the workouts are less than 30 min and it motives you that the person showing the workouts is actually pregnant! Completely love everything on this app. Must get it!
34,34,1,2019-06-01T00:09:56.000Z,Lindsey0316,Irritated with this App,"Wish I hadn‚Äôt purchased. Every time I start the Fitness portion, I get kicked out of the app when my screen goes to rest mode (goes dark) then I have to go back in and restart the fitness program I was already doing. I have to do this multiple times during the workout so I started taking screen shots of the workouts to avoid going back into the app which defeats the purpose of having the app. The app is fully updated on my end. I purchased the 3 month option which I wish I hadn‚Äôt done.  Overall annoyed with this app and would like to get my money back."
35,35,5,2020-06-08T00:21:44.000Z,MomofTomTom,Amazing for Pregnancy and Post-Partum!,"I love always having a pregnancy-stage-appropriate workout ready to go on my phone! Now that I‚Äôm 12 weeks post-partum, this app really takes away any excuse to work out and get back into shape. While I used it primarily for the fitness aspects, the food and general wellness tidbits are also great. Highly recommend for any expecting mom, and look forward to using it fo my next pregnancy!"
36,36,4,2021-05-23T18:23:22.000Z,CassHuf,TTC need ability to focus on certain areas,I enjoy using this app. I do however think you should be able to customize specific areas you‚Äôd like to focus on prior to conception. Not many abdominal workouts mostly squats and lunges. Warm ups are the same most days. I‚Äôve been using the app consistently for over three months now. Their health information and nutrition is great enjoy getting the daily updates. I would recommend this app.
37,37,4,2021-07-26T11:35:11.000Z,LaurelMarie,Need time between reps,"Overall love this app. BUT. I am almost seven months pregnant and have a big belly already. If y‚Äôall wanna switch between a looped band leg exercises and exercises that don‚Äôt use the band, I‚Äôm gonna need a hot second to take that bad boy on and off. Having to constantly pause the workouts to change equipment is annoying. Would love a quick break between each rep if we‚Äôre changing equipment. We are pregnant, after all! Thank you!"

39,39,2,2020-09-10T18:25:51.000Z,Kaylinrose,Safe?,"I am 5wks along, have endometriosis, Adenomyosis and pelvic floor issues. The first thing this app wanted me to do, was pelvic floor exercises. You aren‚Äôt really inclusive for high risk pregnancies and women whom have health issues. There isn‚Äôt even a place to put this information in like there is with other pregnancy apps. Within the first 30 seconds of opening this app, it wanted me to sign up for a premium membership, I haven‚Äôt even looked over the app and you already want my credit card information? I‚Äôll be deleting this app now."
40,40,2,2018-03-23T15:10:44.000Z,Miriampliego,What a disappointment,Ok first of all I would like to said that ok your app is good and all.... but most of the stuff is lock and you need to paid 7/mon is not worth to me I would pay only on time payment to unlock everything. As good as it is is my worth to me to download it if everything is going to be lock plus is not worth for me to pay that can of app ... to be honest you guys need to fix this other wise is not worth to download it mommas out there don‚Äôt waste your time with this app ... such a disappointment.

I‚Äôve checked all settings. How can I do a workout when I‚Äôm not sure when to move to the next move? I need a countdown, timer or something. I like the exercises but the app seems unfinished. Plus the workout girl forgets she‚Äôs supposed to keep going and she stops and starts in the middle of the move. That‚Äôs distracting. I have better apps for exercise and will continue to use those instead."

I absolutely LOVE this app and how they provide options for ability levels, tips on nutrition, and a fun way to track health goals for the duration of pregnancy (and after!) I highly recommend this app to expecting mamas for a fun and fit pregnancy experience!"
44,44,5,2021-05-14T22:36:37.000Z,izzy1155,Amazing!!!,"I had a few bumbs in the road with this app to forget but it was simple mistakes made by me. I set the wrong due date, so it threw off the app and I was stuck at week 3, day one for a bit. I contacted customer service, and a team member (Alyssa) was so helpful! The app is working perfect for me now! I am so excited to try the recipes and workouts ‚ù§Ô∏è"
45,45,5,2021-02-22T19:24:05.000Z,Jocey48,Enjoying this app a a lot!,I canceled my gym membership (pandemic and now expecting) to try this instead and really love it! I wake up every morning and read through the ‚Äúdaily bites.‚Äù The workouts are awesome and my legs were even sore (a good sore) after one of the lower body workouts. You can personalize the app a good bit and the creator is very nice! Thanks!
46,46,4,2020-11-11T13:41:20.000Z,workoutmama!,Great app!,"I really like this app, but I was surprised it doesn‚Äôt stop automatically when the workout was over, which is the only reason I took one star off.  I did the stretches at the end and then it started over at the top again.  Would be nice if it lets you know when it‚Äôs over so you don‚Äôt have to keep track.  My early morning mom brain would appreciate that! üòÅ"
47,47,3,2020-01-08T17:34:20.000Z,*RachelAnna*,Better for premium,I really like the features on this app. I thought some recipes and scheduled workouts would be included in the free app but it‚Äôs not. I was fine with not accessing the recipes. But when I started my workout routine I was only able to use one workout out of the 4 I scheduled. I wish I would have known that before I downloaded. I also don‚Äôt like that it doesn‚Äôt sync with any other of my fitness apps-not even apple health.

49,49,2,2020-11-07T11:33:13.000Z,Barclay22,Not ‚Äúfree for 7 days‚Äù,I JUST downloaded the app. As your going through it for the first time it makes you choose what subscription you want. I figured after 7 days it would pull it out NO! It pulled out immediately and I got the notification from my bank. When I went to cancel the subscription in hopes of getting my money back it‚Äôs not under my subscribed apps. Now I have to email and probably make a call to people in hopes I can get this canceled and get my money back.
50,50,2,2019-01-01T17:21:56.000Z,asbpeter,Only got the first week of exercises,"I started the premium fitness studio account last week and loved it! I did all my exercises and was looking forward to my new plan being delivered today for week 14. It says my new plan was sent today, but it‚Äôs still only showing me old exercises and that I‚Äôve completed everything for the week. The ‚Äúsupport‚Äù and ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù links on their website don‚Äôt work so I haven‚Äôt been able to get a hold of anyone for help regarding this issue."
51,51,3,2019-01-20T12:37:41.000Z,Tiff 1011,Disappointed,I have been using this app ever since I was pregnant and still use it 6 months after. I use to like reading the quotes at the bottom of the page which is mainly one of the reasons why I kept the app and now with the new update they took the quotes part out. I was so disappointed and still am. I guess you have to pay for that.....I didn't want to delete the app but I think I'm going to have to.
52,52,2,2019-01-22T23:07:14.000Z,Kailyn Spears,Can‚Äôt get the day counter off!!!,I downloaded the app and started tracking my pregnancy at about 5 weeks of pregnancy. I had a miscarriage and despite the MULTIPLE times I‚Äôve ‚Äúreported a loss‚Äù it will not stop tracking my ‚Äúpregnancy.‚Äù It‚Äôs hurtful to open the app and see that I should be at 8 weeks pregnancy now and I miscarried a week ago and the app still has not registered that I‚Äôm no longer pregnant. What am I supposed to do?! Report the ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù of my baby? Need to work this bug out ASAP.
53,53,5,2019-10-25T16:36:51.000Z,Mondragon813,Great Workouts,"I love this app! It‚Äôs really saved me the hassle of trying to seek out different workouts to keep myself motivated to actually do exercise. Especially now that I‚Äôm pregnant, I OT was hard to find motivation to actually get up and go workout, but they make it easy and simple, so you don‚Äôt have an excuse to not do it."
54,54,5,2019-09-10T06:13:09.000Z,rubiired,Just starting out,Just starting out and I feel amazing. I love how they are starting me off slow. I feel like when I have other people try to get me to start working out they push me to hard to where I don‚Äôt wanna work out again. This is definitely the start of something good.
55,55,5,2020-10-12T14:40:36.000Z,extrasmallburger,Love this app,"This app is fantastic for not only pregnancy safe workouts, but also workouts when you are trying to get pregnant. I‚Äôve been using this for many months now, and I love that there are new great workouts every week. It keeps things fresh. The developer is also very responsive. Love it!"
56,56,4,2020-03-28T16:25:11.000Z,Indy Pendent,I love this app!,"I was looking for safe and effective exercise routines now that I‚Äôm in the 2nd trimester. I use this app every day and really appreciate the at home workouts. I wish there were more recipe options (the info on the site makes it sound like there‚Äôs unlimited access to some things) and prenatal yoga added, but besides that I don‚Äôt have any complaints!"
57,57,3,2020-03-30T08:08:06.000Z,katiasand,Good exercises but the workout doesn‚Äôt progress,"The exercises look good, but the workout is frustrating and time-consuming (and not as effective) because when one exercise finishes, the next doesn‚Äôt automatically start. I‚Äôm having to go back, resume the workout, and hit play again in order to move on to the next exercise. Am I doing something wrong? I‚Äôd like to just play the whole workout."
58,58,2,2021-05-26T22:09:45.000Z,Krista117,I hate following videos,"I‚Äôd like this app much better if it were more reading based, or at least had options for reading instead of videos. I don‚Äôt enjoy guided workouts and find it too distracting to focus on form while trying to watch a tiny screen. I‚Äôd rather be able to download a list of exercises, have it say do 30 seconds of each with a 15 second rest between sets. I do that anyway, but I have to screenshot it and it‚Äôs a nuisance."
59,59,1,2021-03-24T20:05:47.000Z,webber2846284629,Rip off!,"Signed up for a free trial to see what this was like but failed to cancel in time. This app is EXPENSIVE.  I will edit that having it be a one year subscription, at over $100 a year, seems predatory to me. Options for month-to-month memberships or other models for membership would be better, as a persons ability to engage with physical activity during and after pregnancy can change significantly. I am pregnant and busy and exhausted and will now have to go through the App Store maze to figure out how to get my money back."
60,60,1,2018-06-20T01:04:01.000Z,Ann_renee17,Don‚Äôt download free version,I‚Äôm 6 months pregnant with my first child. I downloaded this app because I haven‚Äôt exercised at all during my pregnancy and wanted safe guided prego workouts and tips that wouldn‚Äôt hurt my baby. Every single article and workout is blocked from the free version. You might as well not even download it if you‚Äôre not going to pay for the unlimited because you can‚Äôt use ANY of the features in this app without paying. It‚Äôs sad because it seems like such a great app but I can‚Äôt afford it.
61,61,5,2018-11-20T03:41:49.000Z,SaraW5590,Worth the subscription!,I‚Äôm doing my free trial now and I LOVE it! Costs way less than a gym membership and the exercises are keeping my heart rate elevated without working that hard. I‚Äôm already pretty fit so having this get my heart rate up during my first trimester is really impressive!
62,62,2,2018-12-22T00:02:03.000Z,lisamarie0303,Free version is worthless,"This app seems like a great idea, and I was thrilled to see they offered a free version. However, almost all content is locked on the free version. I made my fitness plan to include 3 workouts per week, but only the first workout was unlocked. I would have to subscribe to get the rest if the workouts. As I have a new baby, I have better things to spend my money on. I have deleted this app and will go back to using 8fit for workouts."
63,63,4,2019-05-22T15:41:12.000Z,Prso20,Great prenatal workouts,"I‚Äôm on my second trimester and this app is helping me exercise frequently. The workouts are the perfect length and very balanced. I do them at the gym or at home. The additional exercises, meditations and kegel feature are also very helpful to do them when you just have a few minutes here and there."
64,64,5,2020-08-09T15:35:18.000Z,SandyG713,Amazing!,"I‚Äôve never written a review before, but this app was so great and I was too excited to not. I don‚Äôt even have the premium, but I have access to an awesome workout plan, recipes to try, meditations, and more! It‚Äôs so awesome that the free version has bits from the entire app. I‚Äôm really excited to do this!"
65,65,2,2019-12-23T15:02:51.000Z,kellyreview111,Don‚Äôt like most recent update,"I was doing these workouts through week 30 of my pregnancy but after the app updated, I had to switch away to a new app. The new exercises on this app are much harder to follow, the app has glitches every time I tried to use it and the woman doing the exercises was not pregnant herself. Too bad I had to switch away because I loved the previous version of the app but this new version is just not worth the money for me."
66,66,3,2021-02-16T14:26:02.000Z,RicanLyfe,No Apple Health App Compatibility,My biggest drawback about the app is that it is not compatible with the Apple Health App. I like to keep track of my exercise progress with the health app because I use multiple apps for exercise. I have to start my workout on my Apple Watch to ensure my minutes and calories for the workouts on this app to count towards my daily goals.
67,67,5,2019-08-14T19:45:28.000Z,krispypop19,My first workout,"Wow! first I learned I can do much more then some people treat us we can during pregnancy, it feels good from the zen den breathing that will kick start ur day like a cup of joe then makes u feel active when u use that energy to a calming mid sweat 20 min workout. Looking forward to the cardio section!!!"
68,68,5,2020-10-04T15:22:21.000Z,Emily Walrus,Thank you !!!,"Feeling so lost and under supported in my first trimester bc my pregnancy was a surprise and it‚Äôs taken me a moment to decide how to proceed. The supportive mantras, nutritional and lifestyle tips on this app are helping me feel strong and capable as I move toward my final decision. Thank you so much during this emotional time üíóüíóüôè"
69,69,3,2019-06-24T08:09:00.000Z,ireallycantbebothered,Need to evolve the exercise section,"I love the concept and was really excited to download the app. However I was disappointed with the workouts. There is little guidance in terms of technique (keep your knees in, toes back etc) and it‚Äôs very stilted, making the overall experience unsatisfactory. I loved the recipe ideas. If they improve the exercise section I‚Äôll get the premium but right now I‚Äôm looking for other alternatives."
70,70,5,2017-11-14T17:30:40.000Z,Elizabobb,Love the positivity boosts,I love going into the app and reading the inspirational quotes and messages. They help get me excited about the journey I‚Äôm on and always seem to make me feel better if I‚Äôm feeling low. Looking forward to using this app throughout the course of my pregnancy.
71,71,1,2018-05-28T22:29:58.000Z,AlyssaAllison13,App closes by itself when you actually want to use it.,"I finally paid for the subscription for this app and was thrilled to get more personalized workouts by week. I got to look at my workouts a total of two times before the app stopped working. I will click on my workouts now and then the app closes. I tried deleting and redone loading, my phone is updated to the latest update and so is the app. I am very disappointed"
72,72,1,2018-07-13T20:10:16.000Z,kel.c,Great features bad functions,"The app appears to have great features. However, I cannot get the app to connect without being on WiFi. I reached out to their staff and they were extremely friendly but the issue is still happening months later. The app also seems to be calculating my pregnancy week 1 week off from all of my other apps. For some reason it is one week behind even though I entered the same due date."
73,73,1,2018-09-19T14:57:20.000Z,stefstarx33,Unable to log in,"I would love to see what the app is about to have a healthier pregnancy my second time around but i cant make it passed the login with facebook. It keeps telling me i have no internet connection. I also tried to with my email and it wouldn't stop loading, then it told me I already created an account with my email. I cant get passed the beginning at all. Ive tried multiple times, multiple days and nothing."
74,74,5,2018-10-14T14:56:55.000Z,mrswooden,Love it!!,They have workouts that are fitting for all stages of pregnancy! I love being able to stay fit and have quick workouts to do at home! I have other children so it‚Äôs a great alternative to having to leave the comfort of home and packing everyone up!!
75,75,5,2019-01-08T01:58:58.000Z,nativimommy,First time to use today.,"first I would like to thank this app for being free. Secondly, the content is amazing, but it‚Äôs only been one day. It‚Äôs hard to find a good pregnancy work out app for free! Please try this app if you‚Äôre considering downloading it. So far, i dont regret it at all."
76,76,4,2019-02-02T06:17:55.000Z,ama11a,Great workouts for pregnant women- just wish there were more postpartum workouts,LOVE the workouts! They‚Äôre challenging without being too strenuous for a tired third-trimester momma. My only feedback is I wish they had more workouts for the postpartum period! That‚Äôs the only thing keeping me from purchasing the lifetime subscription.
77,77,2,2019-09-27T01:12:06.000Z,TayMC98,Exercises not recommended for third trimester,Everything has been great except the exercises. Most of the videos are performed by a women who is clearly not pregnant or maybe barely in her first trimester. I don‚Äôt really think the developers understood what a women‚Äôs body literally cannot do in the third trimester because their stomach is so big. It‚Äôs made for some petty uncomfortable exercise. App could be five stars with actual pregnant models and exercises that moved with your pregnancy.
78,78,5,2019-09-14T17:00:15.000Z,BonnielWood,Great app!,"On my third pregnancy and wanted to make sure to keep up with all the self care that‚Äôs helpful, this app definitely covers all of it- super sweet.  Haven‚Äôt gone premium yet but thinking of buying to get the recipes, they look very nourishing and satisfying."
79,79,3,2020-11-25T11:51:41.000Z,Neeeeessssshhhhaaa,Curious,"Honestly I‚Äôm giving this app another shot, when I first had it back in July I did the workout and started having horrible pains which lead to a miscarriage, not honestly sure if it was the workout just noticed it happened following. I‚Äôm now pregnant again and think I‚Äôll try to give it another shot but be careful"
80,80,5,2018-05-24T15:45:45.000Z,@heymace,love üòç,"this app is pure motivation for a healthy pregnancy. I love the organization and layout of it all and find new great tips and info daily. Can‚Äôt wait to get off bed rest, and start using some postpartum features once my babes are here!"
81,81,5,2019-01-14T17:22:18.000Z,Brenaee,I love this app!,I am 19 weeks pregnant and so far I love this app! It‚Äôs easy to do at home and I feel like the workouts are perfectly challenging. The workouts aren‚Äôt super long so I usually do more than 1 but that allows me to mix it up.
82,82,1,2019-03-12T01:03:42.000Z,swindledmama,Evil money stealing sham app,I don‚Äôt remember ever agreeing to a paid version. I just started getting noticed it was charging me $20 occasionally. Whenever I tried to click ‚Äúmanage subscription‚Äù to cancel the page would go white and never load. I finally was able to cancel my subscription today after I don‚Äôt know how many tries. This app took $60+ from me and I never used it once! Click with caution.
83,83,5,2019-04-29T01:04:47.000Z,MarBar80,So far so good!,"I‚Äôm enjoying the app so far, the workouts feel challenging enough so I know I‚Äôm getting a workout without wondering if I‚Äôm doing something that could cause an injury. Lots of cool stuff in the app to explore also!"
84,84,5,2020-08-04T21:17:19.000Z,MN Puzzler,Great tool for new moms!,I highly recommend this app for new moms! This has been a great help for me for tracking items for my OBGYN instead of resulting to paper and pencil. The guided exercises and pelvic floor exercises makes it so easy to get the time in! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
85,85,2,2019-08-23T19:49:05.000Z,jessicaroseholmes,This is why American women are fat,This morning I decided to use the apps work out instead of my normal work out routine. Let‚Äôs just say the work out are useless. The lat pull down is actually a shoulder press and rest looks similarly ill informed. None of these work out would really help anything except get your heart rate up. The daily dose information is neat but that‚Äôs the only cool thing about this.
86,86,5,2020-01-04T23:18:29.000Z,bmjo28,Really love it.,I‚Äôve had the app for a few months and the more I use it the more I love it. I love the formate. The workouts and recipes are great too. Bottom line - this app has made being pregnant easier for me.
87,87,2,2020-02-05T02:41:57.000Z,BlondeZombieGirl,Love and hate,The few work out Iv done have been great I would love to try the other functions or even other workouts but unlike other reviews that say it‚Äôs 7$ a month (which is reasonable and why I got the app to consider the membership) it is in-fact 17$ a month. I think I will stick to the free stuff till I find an more reasonable priced app or one that is free all together.
88,88,2,2021-05-12T17:45:45.000Z,CHSgirl949,Could be better,The meditation requires reading rather than a voice recording one can listen to which defeats the relaxation. There are many apps that do this much better.
89,89,4,2020-02-02T23:26:50.000Z,Obgyn res,Helping me stay fit even when l‚Äôm feeling tired,"Provides exercises I can do, even at 34 weeks pregnant. It gives me energy. Helps strengthen my pelvic flor and reminds me to breath and relax. I have recommended it and i think it will also be helpful in the postpartum phase."
90,90,1,2018-06-05T23:59:56.000Z,sanfilipa,Keep Getting an Error,"1 Star because I can‚Äôt even get into the app. After registering via email or through Facebook, it keeps giving me an error saying I need access to the internet. Try again when I get access. Clearly I have access if it verified my identity through Facebook and have full WiFi. I‚Äôve installed and uninstalled multiple times. Why doesn‚Äôt this work for me?"
91,91,5,2018-11-07T02:30:23.000Z,Ced1234567,Awesome app!,This app is exactly what I have been looking for. I am so grateful to have found it. The workouts are awesome and make me feel so strong. Look forward to trying some of the recipes.
92,92,1,2019-03-01T02:22:17.000Z,Rjmtanimals,Good so far!,"Got a little lost when the video starts over, every time; lol, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm going to get used to it!"
93,93,5,2019-04-16T20:45:12.000Z,libbysark,Amazing workout videos and voice over,"These workouts are amazing I loved how easy they are to follow, videos are great quality and the voice over are is so motivating and helpful."
94,94,5,2019-09-08T00:08:05.000Z,Bmones1988,Smart design,This seems to be a really well thought out app that‚Äôs easy to use and I think will be EFFECTIVE helping me be fit and healthy in pregnancy with how organized and easy it is!  Thanks!!
95,95,5,2021-08-21T11:32:47.000Z,thesunflowerss,Great app,"The app is professional and really well-balanced. I like its free plan very much. One thing, it would be great, if breathing exercises have sound, so that you could do it with your eyes closed ‚ù§Ô∏è"
96,96,2,2021-05-28T12:18:08.000Z,ShaanB,Beware,Not optimised for iPad - it looks horrible and you have to use in portrait mode.
97,97,2,2019-06-19T14:07:00.000Z,carcar89123,Keeps crashing,I love the concept of this app but I have to always close it and resume about 3-4 times in a workout because it just freezes.  Very frustrating when you are a Mom pressed for time and trying to be healthy!  The workouts are great otherwise but some bugs need to be fixed.
98,98,3,2019-08-17T02:37:56.000Z,hatshejewelz,Well considered app,"Good app would be better if there weren‚Äôt delayed transitions between the workout circuit. I wish the premium was a little lower for moms, I do appreciate how the workouts are different each day. I hope to use it and actually receive the desired results."
99,99,2,2021-03-22T14:34:23.000Z,Rach1195,Not helpful,You don‚Äôt get any recipes unless you pay first. Not even one to try. It also doesn‚Äôt let you add in dietary preferences and allergies. I‚Äôm a vegetarian and allergic to fish. Even the locked premium recipes were basically useless from what I could gather from their titles. I downloaded this solely for the nutrition portion. Very disappointed.
100,100,5,2017-11-20T02:32:54.000Z,Wilkins!!!!!!! ü¶Ñ,Best app for pregnancy ever,This app is so helpful with my baby. It has a countdown so I never have to check what day I‚Äôm on. There was so much useful and helpful information. Thanks!
101,101,1,2018-05-26T20:30:35.000Z,Kudjorocco1,Would love to love this app,"This is the second time that I‚Äôve tried to download this app, gotten as far as going to the fitness studio and it crashes on me. I have an iPhone and I‚Äôve never had issues with apps. I‚Äôm currently looking for an app to guide me and basically be my workout buddy through this second pregnancy but at this rate I guess I‚Äôll never know."
102,102,5,2018-07-19T14:39:25.000Z,mcparrack,Who purchased the $7.99??,Who purchased the app and actually enjoyed using it and noticed results during pregnancy?
103,103,5,2019-04-04T16:05:28.000Z,mokd2472:1,First time was great,Just finished my first workout with this app and I really loved it! I feel energized and accomplished!!
104,104,2,2021-06-14T18:04:36.000Z,marielarobpen,technical difficulties,"the program and app in general is well thought out- from workouts to self care, recipes and articles for pregnancy are a good mix. the reason i‚Äôm giving it a low rating is because of the video player they use. it is very inconvenient to not be able to rewind or fast forward while working out, especially since the videos mess up so much you have to constantly close and reopen the app to get them to start playing again. if it weren‚Äôt for this huge inconvenience of interrupting the workouts, i would happily pay for this app."
105,105,1,2019-07-25T17:21:20.000Z,KungPowAgnes,Excitment cut short,"I was really looking forward to this app and ignored all the locked icons I saw on exercises and recipes, thinking that they would get unlocked as I completed workouts and goals. Nope, pay to play. The amount you get to do on your free version is about 5-10% of what is potentially offered. It honestly isn't even worth it to have the free trial: one exercise regime and no recipes."
106,106,1,2020-12-31T21:58:40.000Z,AthenaMc:D,1 lesson for free,"It looked ok, I liked the first video.  However I quickly found out that was the 1 and only video unless I wanted to pay. I knew there were in app purchases, I didn‚Äôt know I had to pay to use it.  Why not just be honest and charge up front?  Again it looked good & I liked the first video, I did not like the misleading of it being a ‚Äúfree‚Äù app."
107,107,3,2020-11-05T18:07:45.000Z,EveryMFNicknameIsFckinTaken,Keeps closing out of the app,"I want to like this app but I just installed it and when I started the workout, after the video was finished it keeps closing out of the app. Huge inconvenience for when you want to get a good workout in."
108,108,1,2020-12-16T20:45:18.000Z,Deminota,Can‚Äôt get it to work,"I haven‚Äôt actually gotten to use this app yet, because literally every time I pull it up, it freezes. It‚Äôs practically just a wallpaper at this point. I don‚Äôt know what the problem is. No one else seems to be having this issue. But I‚Äôm not getting any use out of it so I think I‚Äôll just have to delete it."
109,109,4,2021-03-17T16:41:55.000Z,Xtina Archer,Some points,"I really like this so far I just wish the woman in the exercise video was pregnant, I feel a little self conscious working out to someone who isn‚Äôt pregnant"
110,110,5,2018-05-22T20:04:08.000Z,Lyric93,üòçüòçüòç,Well worth the purchase! Wish that was around when I had my son! I recommend to everyone üòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
111,111,5,2019-05-04T14:44:00.000Z,Dr.Collins,Workout,I am 25 weeks which makes me 6 months pregnant this workout was awesome challenging at times but necessary!!
112,112,5,2019-09-20T23:47:30.000Z,karlat88,Great app!,The app its really easy to manage and also for keeping track of your pregancy process. I'm so glad I found it.
113,113,4,2020-02-03T03:08:29.000Z,Ruski929,Great workouts!,Great workout routines! Love the other sections such as relaxation and food ideas.
114,114,5,2019-09-20T15:35:56.000Z,Jenniespinnies,Love the exercises,"I love the exercises, thank you. I joined a gym, but this app helps me still work out when my baby is sick or when he is napping."
115,115,5,2019-07-11T18:01:46.000Z,dmixo,Great so far!,"I have only used the app for two days, but I love it! I love the pace of the workouts and the zen section is my favorite!"
116,116,1,2021-01-13T22:31:56.000Z,EllieBelle11,Was expecting more,Pretty disappointed that there is very little offered without paying. I had read about a ton of stuff this app offered and I was expecting some additional cost to use all of its resources but I literally can‚Äôt do anything anymore unless I want to pay and I only did 1 video.
117,117,2,2020-09-28T11:05:15.000Z,Efggvjjjbhggg,Okay...,It‚Äôs kind of expensive. Especially when your saving up and preparing for a new baby I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to add another bill to my list. I just wish there was a few things you could look at on the free side of this app ‚òπÔ∏è
118,118,4,2020-02-14T14:34:02.000Z,Brightplus app user,Worth it?,"It‚Äôs great. Just only worth your money if you use it everyday. Otherwise, I think they‚Äôre charging too much for this app."
119,119,1,2020-03-04T01:06:21.000Z,Sew1989,Worthless Unless You Pay For It,I hate a app that is 100% set up to make you pay and is outrageously expensive for a application on your cellphone. This app fits that description. You get one workout free then anything else you need to pay for and they want a unrealistic monthly payment for the services provided.
120,120,1,2018-06-07T13:40:36.000Z,cookie_s,Loved it until it became corrupted,It‚Äôs been over two weeks and I can‚Äôt access the app.  I‚Äôve tried deleting and reinstalling but every time it says I don‚Äôt have internet connection.  I‚Äôve tried going to the website and it isn‚Äôt working either.  I‚Äôm probably going to delete it for good now.
121,121,2,2018-10-29T21:17:40.000Z,Sasha price,Terrible,The food options n info is good but the app only works in WiFi regardless of the phones data plan ... pointless! And I paid to upgrade for info I thought I was going to get but they don‚Äôt actually show you pregnancy workouts
122,122,1,2019-01-19T20:05:08.000Z,MapGurl,App keeps crashing,"I downloaded the app and started the 7 day trial today and when I click on the Fitness Studio, the app crashes. This is extremely frustrating. If I can‚Äôt try it out during the 7 day trial, I definitely won‚Äôt be purchasing anything."
123,123,5,2019-02-12T22:46:54.000Z,KF0528,Good at home workouts,So far I‚Äôve really liked the app. The workouts are well explained.

127,127,1,2021-03-03T13:09:15.000Z,Blue Eyes4,Not worth it!,"#1 I have pregnancy brain #2 I didn‚Äôt see anything on this app that‚Äôs worth $130, which is what I got charged after the free trial. I understand I had so many days to cancel, but I‚Äôve never been charged so much for an app. That‚Äôs absolutely absurd. I have enough to think about and this isn‚Äôt worth it."
128,128,1,2019-07-03T20:20:24.000Z,BetiL28,Not ready?,"I downloaded this app and was disappointed to find that it has not been fully developed yet. Besides encountering numerous bugs, I was not able to access parts of the app as an error message kept popping up: ‚Äúoops! We‚Äôre working on this, check back later‚Äù."
129,129,3,2020-04-30T15:41:01.000Z,gracieyi7,Nice way to keep active pre and postpartum,...but the exercises become too repetitive and predictable after awhile. Stretches also feel rushed at the end of the workout

132,132,1,2018-05-28T14:09:14.000Z,BW120217,High hopes,"I had high hopes, but every time I try to use the app it closes on me. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I try to do. I would have liked to see what it had to offer, but I couldn‚Äôt get that far. I downloaded and deleted several times. It is very disappointing."
133,133,1,2018-12-29T23:00:17.000Z,98652,Isn‚Äôt functioning,"I downloaded the app & enjoyed my first workout. I decided to commit to the first month to see if I would keep up the workouts. When I click on the 2nd workout, and select ‚ÄúTry for free for 7 days‚Äù it just spins and doesn‚Äôt do anything. Super disappointing."
134,134,2,2019-01-07T23:07:07.000Z,jtaylor1987,Deceiving,I enjoyed it the first time I used the app but then when I went to use it again everything was locked and I had to pay. That was extremely deceiving. Uninstalled.

138,138,1,2019-06-11T14:16:21.000Z,kikis_review,You have to pay,As it turns out mostly everything on the app is locked and requires premium membership to access. Don‚Äôt be fooled as they will get your data but won‚Äôt return anything useful to you.

143,143,1,2018-09-07T11:23:39.000Z,irishgirl22221214,Don‚Äôt waste time,Unlike other apps this one has you sign up and then any link or article you click on a pop up shows ‚Äúsign up for premium‚Äù. Other apps provide this info for free so why bother.
144,144,1,2019-03-01T12:51:38.000Z,drobi19,Won‚Äôt send reset link,"Got a new phone, re-downloaded app, wouldn‚Äôt recognize my email and password, tried multiple times to request a reset link, but it never came through."

151,151,1,2018-05-06T20:29:37.000Z,Lyseug,Expensive,There is not one workout you can do or see without buying the subscription. Not much you can do without purchasing the monthly subscription.
152,152,1,2018-06-10T13:29:19.000Z,jessytk3,Pointless unless you pay,"You get none of the benefits unless you pay a monthly rate. Not worth it in my opinion. There are too many free apps out there, I don‚Äôt feel the need to pay for one."
153,153,1,2018-11-19T03:33:05.000Z,chelseag88,Just keeps loading,It‚Äôs really hard to do a workout when the screen just sits there with the loading circle. No a fan. Wouldn‚Äôt waste your money

158,158,3,2019-06-13T04:13:37.000Z,Chala Mack,Should not be listed as free,The app should be free trial for X amount of days then be a purchased app. You can‚Äôt realistically benefit from the app without subscribing.
159,159,2,2020-04-25T00:56:08.000Z,k0t0b,Mostly not free,1 workout a week for free. To access additional workouts you have to purchase a premium membership.

200,200,5,2016-07-31T16:23:00.000Z,azz239,Informative and fun!,Love this app because I can keep track of everything!
201,201,5,2016-08-09T12:38:58.000Z,Shar Peters,More convenient!,I've been a fan of the emails and the app now makes it more convenient to access the content. I recommend it.
202,202,5,2016-10-06T22:39:15.000Z,21 days to go,Love love love this app.,"Absolutely love this. It's so much fun to see the daily countdown and I've been looking for fitness and food info for pregnancy for so long. At last I have it, and it's so cool to read. Loving it. üòÑüòÑ"
203,203,2,2016-11-28T06:48:15.000Z,JENicolC,Disappointed,Just downloaded the app and upon trying to sign up and enter my due date I found difficulty. As soon as I try to select a date they will will scroll back to today's date immediately. I guess the app is not gonna work properly if it doesn't know where I am in gestation. Needs fixing.
204,204,2,2017-03-19T11:12:10.000Z,Jlsenc,The app rarely works,I get the emails and whenever I want to read more and switch to the app it either kicks me out  it tells me I'm not connected to the internet ( which I always am). It has good info but they need to fix the bugs
205,205,1,2017-04-30T16:01:19.000Z,RelaxedGamer,Not worth the $$,"I have OVIA & What to expect apps, they've been so great. First time mama here. I come across this one & says I have to pay for an upgrade to see the content. It's ridiculous. For you interested consumers & especially for the first time mamas, this app isn't worth the purchase especially if you're trying to save for the baby & all that entails & already going through so much with doctors & your own preparation as a parent. Keep your $$ in your pockets. The information you gain from this app is dull compared to the apps I've mentioned above! I highly recommend OVIA or What to expect! üòÅ"
206,206,4,2017-05-18T16:08:08.000Z,LauraV2010,Lacking content,The developer promptly responded to my review so I've updated the stars and look forward to seeing any updates on this app.
207,207,2,2017-06-29T12:21:33.000Z,TheLoudChick,Upgrade for what?,"I gave 2 stars because it does give you a day countdown which I really like towards the end. However, the app wants you to subscribe for 4.99 a month to access its articles. The articles are short and not very useful or informative. There is so much information out there and so many other free baby apps that give you great articles. The 4.99 A MONTH is a joke. Other than the daily countdown this app is a waste of space."
208,208,2,2017-10-12T17:36:15.000Z,Ceci Rose,Crashing hard,Every time I go to use this app now it says to connect to internet or it instantly crashes. :( I‚Äôm at home connected to my internet every single time I try to load up the app.

218,218,2,2021-06-25T13:53:24.000Z,Mfantetti,Glitchy. Repetitive. Not motivating,I did 3 days of free trial and cancelled.  I have the intention of finding an app to pay for the remainder of pregnancy and postpartum.  This app is a big NO from me.  It‚Äôs incredibly slow moving and glitchy.  All the work out videos are the same movements so there isn‚Äôt a lot of variety (so why would I pay!??).  The voice that is used to describe the movements breaks-up and is so monotonous- it‚Äôs torture listening to it!  I tried to connect to Spotify to have background music playing but it plays random music that doesn‚Äôt go with the workout (it selected a Christmas song one time!!!). Also I don‚Äôt have a lot of the equipment that‚Äôs needed.  I have a yoga mat and a few lightweights- that‚Äôs it.  So it was hard to select from the very little workouts that were offered.
219,219,1,2021-05-11T08:08:50.000Z,xistytiee,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with the people who run this app, because I requested a cancellation and refund because I didn‚Äôt know how expensive it was going to be and without ever using the app they canceled my subscription but never gave me my money back. It‚Äôs been a hassle and I still have not heard from them.They charge me $119 and for what the app has it is not worth the money! Beware because if you want out they will not help you"
220,220,5,2021-03-22T15:23:25.000Z,AJ72097,"I love this app!  A bit pricy, but so worth it.","I love this app. The workouts are easy and fun. I am not someone who enjoys exercising, but this app keeps me motivated. I‚Äôve never had an issue with bugs or glitches (surprisingly considering I have an older iPhone), and I just love the general layout of the app. Everything is easy to find, and there‚Äôs a ton to do. You get a new selection of workouts every week, and most of them you need little to no equipment for. There‚Äôs also tons of other features like a period and ovulation tracker, different meal recipes each week, and a ton more. My husband and I are currently trying for our first, and there‚Äôs even a setting specifically for women trying to conceive."
221,221,5,2020-08-06T08:53:06.000Z,MonasticBelle,Loved and Used it Pregnancy and Postpartum,"I have been using the premium subscription of Baby2body for about a year‚Äîthrough my pregnancy and now well into baby‚Äôs 6th month, for postpartum weight loss."
222,222,3,2021-01-24T16:50:38.000Z,Lesty pesty,Spotify integration great! Not enough variety of moves,"I love that the narrator isn‚Äôt this hyped up, overly happy, shouty annoyance. She calmly tells you the exercises to do."
223,223,5,2020-06-16T20:00:31.000Z,Cate Stone,Loving this update!!,"I used this app for my first pregnancy and still use it for workouts every now and then because they always kick my butt, in a. Good way! I was on the app the other day and just saw there is now a section for if you‚Äôre trying to conceive (ü•≥) so I switched over a few days ago because we are trying for baby #2 (shh!).  I‚Äôm so relieved to have this kind of support right now just want to be in the best shape possible for this next pregnancy. So far it looks great, will update review the more I use this"
224,224,4,2020-06-26T20:32:22.000Z,anniehotdogs,On the fence,"I love that this app integrates with Spotify so I can listen to my own music while I workout. I can‚Äôt figure out how to access the downloaded workouts though. They spend a lot of time on warm up and cool down, which is nice, but I wish there was a way to skip through those if I‚Äôve already warmed up before the workout. I also wish there was a ‚Äúworkout library‚Äù of sorts, where we could do supplemental workouts on the days when we are feeling good. I‚Äôm 26 weeks pregnant now and some days I feel fabulous and want to do two workouts. One last thing - for an app that‚Äôs specifically geared towards pregnant/postpartum women, it‚Äôs a little surprising that the ‚Äúinstructors‚Äù are all thin, non-pregnant people. Overall it‚Äôs not a bad app for $13 a month. Just needs a little work."
225,225,5,2020-05-18T04:07:03.000Z,fanchastic1,Absolutely love!,"Love this app and wish it were available on Android as well. Beautiful interface, easy to use, practical. I‚Äôm even considering getting premium"
226,226,4,2019-10-10T11:03:51.000Z,Littlejus,"Helpful, with some room for improvement","I‚Äôve been using this app for about a week and it‚Äôs been a great way to stay active as my body changes. Some of the workouts are quite challenging and leave me sweaty; others less so. I like the day to day variety, although some workouts (like high impact cardio or step workouts) aren‚Äôt practical due to apartment living."
227,227,2,2020-04-23T20:07:31.000Z,jennrives246,Just ok,"I was pretty hopeful at first cause the format is really user friendly and pleasant to navigate. However the workouts and kind of blah, redundant, a little boring, and glitchy. The ‚Äúpreviews‚Äù of the next exercise are often just of the fitness instructor standing there. Workouts freeze often, and there isn‚Äôt enough variety in the week. I liked that you could link Spotify and listen to music, but workouts are still kind of boring just doing the same exercise over and over. One user said that it seemed ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù and I would agree. Not yet quite there, but has potential and hopefully with some work it will become an amazing app. However after the week free trial, it wasn‚Äôt work buying a subscription."
228,228,3,2020-02-18T13:48:49.000Z,Tsampson09,Seems good not free,"Seems like a good app, being that I am at home now 40$ a month is just feasible an actual gym membership is cheaper."
229,229,1,2019-12-09T05:49:58.000Z,saraa122,"Unless you buy, you get nothing.","I‚Äôm not sure who exactly is giving this app such high ratings but there‚Äôs LITERALLY nothing you can do on this app (not read most recipes or articles or do any work out) without buying the premium version, which, btw isn‚Äôt like 4.99 either, they‚Äôre asking 17.99 a month. It‚Äôs ridiculous. It seems like a cool app but it‚Äôs unfair that the only thing you get in the free version is ‚Äúbreathing‚Äù (literally!! That part is free) deleting now!"
230,230,1,2018-02-11T13:40:23.000Z,Mks2016**,"Lot of glitches, poor info",No matter what article I click on- every other page starts with the same header:
231,231,1,2018-05-24T02:55:23.000Z,MizJesyka,Terrible App,I tried the premium app to get the full use.
232,232,1,2018-10-22T10:55:42.000Z,jts0545,It‚Äôs pretty but that‚Äôs all...,"Looking for pregnancy health information and healthy workouts? Don‚Äôt even waste your time downloading this app. Treat yourself to quality free workouts on YouTube and downloading a free pregnancy information app such as Baby Center. If you try this app for free- be prepared to be disappointed. There is only one workout available unless you sign up for the free 7 day trial. The free trial( of course ) leads to automatic monthly debits unless you cancel it in time. The format and information on this app are not worth the price as far as I can tell. App designers- If you really wanted folks to try an app and determine the worth of it, you don‚Äôt make them submit their credit card information to access any of the worthwhile content."
233,233,5,2019-01-06T15:32:04.000Z,AmyKmommy,Great app for Prego Mamas,"I really enjoy using this app! I‚Äôm currently in my 25th week of pregnancy and have been using it for over a week now. I love that the workouts fit the week of pregnancy I am in, so I know my baby and I are safe completing them. I also like that you can stream music in the background (I use Amazon) or use your Spotify playlist. The workouts are all less than 30 minutes, so I‚Äôm able to complete them in the morning before work and my toddler waking up. They use minimal equipment I have already in my basement, or it‚Äôs easily supplemented with something else. For example, I don‚Äôt have a step, so I used my stairs. I really haven‚Äôt worked out much this pregnancy, but I‚Äôm going all out for the third trimester thanks to this app. I wish I had downloaded this app sooner! There are also lots of helpful articles and recipes. It may be cool to have some kind of communication set up with the ladies using this app, like a way to connect with other moms using the app also in week 25. Just a thought. üòä Thanks!"
234,234,5,2019-01-17T20:11:33.000Z,CayM0604,Love this App!,"So far, I am SO happy with this app. It‚Äôs exactly what I was looking for in my pregnancy to help encourage and motivate me to stay healthy and active. I opted to pay the money so I could use the fitness portion and I am not disappointed. I needed fairly easy and fast workouts that made me feel like I got a little workout with not too much intensity to make it hard on me in my third trimester AND shorter workouts since I‚Äôm busy running after my 2 year old at the same time. I‚Äôm a beginner when it comes to consistently working out and ‚Äúmedically‚Äù overweight for my height, so I like how simple they make it to follow along and workout in each trimester without it being too advanced to follow. I appreciated the videos portion in the fitness section and that it will link to Spotify for music to workout along to. I love all the little tips and advice and recipes. Overall- I think this is totally worth the monthly payment to add onto my yoga workouts and walking. I really enjoy it and recommend it to any of my preggo mommy friends! Thank you for this app!"
235,235,5,2019-03-23T17:04:22.000Z,EyRiLuLu,Awesome App,I am on week 10 when I found this app and everyday before then I had no motivation to workout and kept eating all kinds of crazy unhealthy cravings. I wasn‚Äôt fully eating good when I started the excercises but this changed my mood and gave me more energy to endure this pregnancy. I started eating healthy little at a time and used their food suggestions on this app to slowly get me back on the right track. I feel amazing and some days I‚Äôm lazy but i love the simple and short workouts. They still kick my butt and everyday I feel stronger using this app. It‚Äôs awesome.
236,236,5,2019-04-13T22:37:19.000Z,KellyKell2019,Amazing is an Understatement!!,"I am currently expecting & will be a first time mom, so I was on the search for a good fitness app geared specifically towards pregnant women. I searched and searched and couldn‚Äôt seem to find an appropriate app and then I came across this gem! I completed my 1st full body blast workout today & I seriously broke a sweat!!"
237,237,5,2019-06-27T03:48:41.000Z,Katybugluv83,Love love love it!!!,This app is great! It lets you pause when you need to and come back to where you left off or even start over again if you want. It‚Äôs reasonably priced. Love the option to link to Spotify my personal opinion I wish it connected to Pandora. The only thing that I‚Äôm noticing is that when I complete a workout it will show that I completed it directly after I do but when I open back up the app it doesn‚Äôt show that I completed it. Other than that it‚Äôs a wonderful app that works you up gradually which is great especially when your as out of shape as I am. I‚Äôm curious though if the workouts grow with you and become more intense.
