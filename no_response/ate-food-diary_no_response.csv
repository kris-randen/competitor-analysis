0,0,5,2021-04-14T15:59:01.000Z,SMKelsey,The little things are big...,"After YouFood ended, I was lost. I loved taking pics of my food to keep a journal, but at some point, I realized that habitually taking the photo just became habit and I always wished for more.  So far, it seems that “Ate” has it.  First, as simple s concept as it is, I love, love, love the on and off path option. Actively saying that I am “on path” is an motivator😇 that I did not anticipate. Likewise, who wants to admit that they’re “off path” 🤷🏽‍♀️? I also love the integration of my water and exercise efforts as well. I’ve only been doing it for three days, so I haven’t really gotten into all of the other benefits but I also like the idea of tracking why I eat, whether I eat at home or out, how the meal was prepared, how I was feeling when I ate and a big one...who I ate with 😉!  I have a feeling that in time, I’m going to see some real trends that will expose for me why I eat the way I eat and more importantly how much I eat. Aside from always saying “I just love food”, that’s a question that I don’t think I’ve truly figured out just yet.  Now, I just need to find some friends for more accountability.  I’m trying the upgrade and had marked my calendar to cancel after 14 days, planning to be unfulfilled, but I know already that I’m in.  Yearly plan paid for.  Wish me luck!  P.S.  I swear I’m not a developer or a friend or family member of theirs and I can prove it.  Just try it and see for yourself!  😂😂"
1,1,5,2019-07-17T17:11:21.000Z,foxesnoxes,Most useful and efficient food tracking,"I’ve tried myfitnesspal calorie counting, daily photo journals, and also just writing out the food but the interface of this app is aesthetically pleasing and visually appealing as well as directed. The option to chose “off path” or “on path” with the reminder of what your current goal is at the top of the screen is brilliantly simple and helps me to minimize obsessive food thoughts like “I ate so bad I’m so fat” or “i ate an apple today so that makes up for the ice cream and chips and cookies I ate the rest of the day” etc etc. It even lets you make a collage of your food pictures at the end of the day, which is a perfect way to visualize what you’re putting into your body. Oh, and you can track calories in the comments under your picture but you can also track where you ate, if you ate alone or with people, why you ate, and how it made you feel which is a genius way to help people make the lifestyle change into eating healthier (instead of forcing yourself to eat ‘healthy’ foods you despise you can focus on the healthy foods you adore). I’ve been searching for an app like this for years and I’m very happy I’ve finally come across it. I hope to use it for a while, and I really appreciate that it’s a free app with no ads. Hands down my favorite health app."
2,2,5,2020-01-12T19:37:43.000Z,Amber Waves Hello,"So far, so good!","I’ve been using ate for about a week, and there are several things I love about it:"
3,3,5,2020-10-16T00:23:49.000Z,zgrooms,Great app and great management!,"I have never reviewed an app before, so that tells you something right off the bat. I have loved the ease in this app. Meal tracking has always stressed me out. I hate measuring things. My meals are too elaborate to traditionally track. Being able to snap a picture (which I usually already do anyways😂 #foodblog) and add a description makes “tracking” so much easier! I’m able to share this app with my nutritionist and she can have an idea of what I am eating in a day without me having to track. The summary questions have allowed me to have a much better relationship with my meals, realizing trends and habits that I may not have realized before. It forces me to slow down and ask myself these important questions. I love it."
4,4,5,2020-06-09T10:07:44.000Z,❤️💛💚💙💜💎|-/ Alyssa,Great app,"I have been using this app for maybe a week or so. Before finding Ate, I tested multiple fasting apps and nothing worked well or was set up good. I don’t even think I want to fast for the reasons on other apps. This app is GREAT. I’ve always taken pictures of my food and saved them, especially when I cook a meal or fix a healthy breakfast for example. Ate allows me to see what I eat in a day and it lets me record how it made me feel (I LOVE this part of the app because I struggle with how food makes me feel). I also love that it adds options such as “who did you eat with?” and “where did you eat?” Overall this app seems perfect for me and I hope I continue to use this to track my food habits."
5,5,5,2021-06-15T02:06:44.000Z,FrauFleur,Only been using for a week and it has done wonders,I was looking for an alternative to calorie and macro counting. After listening to a podcast that focuses heavily on mental aspects of weight loss I thought to myself it would be awesome if I could just snap photos of my food for myself to stay accountable. I began searching the app store for such a thing as a “visual diary” and ran into Ate.
6,6,5,2018-05-03T16:56:47.000Z,Bet @ Bet On Dinner,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I love this app! I wanted a food diary thing, but don’t want to track calories or even type in every teaspoon of oil I use to cook my dinner. I love that I can quickly type something in, and the photo aspect is unexpectedly great! It’s quick to snap a picture and it motivates me to add things like fruit and vegetables to my plate since I’m visually more apt to notice that I’m skipping them and just eating a sandwich or a piece of toast. I also like the freedom to change what is “on path” for me - since it’s not specific to one type of eating. I really love the little arrow that encourages me to make a healthier choice for my next meal if I do go off path - it’s not judgy and unlike other things I’ve tried, I don’t tend to feel like I’ve “ruined” a day with one meal or food, so I’m more likely to just move on and eat something that is better for me at the next meal rather than derail and start again the next day (or week or whatever!). Thanks for such a helpful tool!"
7,7,5,2021-01-12T06:07:45.000Z,ILJ627,Super helpful and easy to use!,"I’ve been using ate for the past week with a group of friends in an effort to take better care of our bodies this year and practice more mindfulness with our eating.  The benefits are already so evident.  Having to actually document what, when, and how much you are eating really makes me think twice before eating too much or eating things that aren’t as good for me, which are 2 big goals for me.  Also, because my friends and I follow each other on the app, it’s actually EXCITING to take a picture of my home-cooked, healthy meals or any other instances where I’m making good food choices!  I have also loved tracking how eating made me feel, which is one of the questions the app asks you after your meal.  Tracking my meals is quick and easy, which is important to me, and I’m going to keep using ate!  Highly recommend if you’re like me and struggle sometimes with being mindful with your eating!"
8,8,5,2021-03-05T17:41:19.000Z,Little5er00,Best app I’ve ever used,"After decades of trying to understand and heal my GI issues, I finally decided I needed to get better at keeping a food journal and tracking how different foods make me feel. A Google search brought up Ate— since it was free and so well reviewed, I downloaded it immediately. I’ve been hooked ever since."
9,9,5,2020-04-03T15:43:17.000Z,Crb1717,Fantastic and amazing!!!,"This is only my second day using the app but it has brought me such peace and joy.  Taking photos of my meals felt strange to me at first but what I realized is that it really promotes mindfulness and reflection.  You can make notes that go along with the picture, creating a new kind of ritual practice that slows down your meal nicely and easily.  I like all the tracking in terms of hunger level, satisfaction, etc.  But perhaps my favorite thing of all are the “experiments” you get to try.  The one I chose to start with is to take 2 deep breaths before eating.  Even that simple act allows me to connect to my body and spirit so that I can listen to my physical and emotional needs.  My lifelong struggle with stress eating has been exasperated due to the COVID-19 situation.  I didn’t want to spiral back down into the overeating so I found this app. I couldn’t be happier, calmer, or feeling more grounded around food.  Thank you to the creators and developers!!!"
10,10,5,2019-05-04T10:22:30.000Z,foofaroo,Perfect for my needs,"I have downloaded every meal tracker app available on the App Store it seems, but nothing was exactly what I was looking for in till I found ate. I just need a simple place where I can write down or take a picture of what I’m eating, which is enough to keep me “on path” without the stress of calorie counting, trying to search a weird database for what I ate, entering the exact quantities of what I ate, or having to report to a health coach. The design of this app is pleasing, it’s easy to use, I like the questions they ask you after your meal so you can reflect on whether you made a good choice or not and why. I’m grateful to the makers of this app for understanding that not everybody wants to spend their entire life counting calories, even if we still want to be healthy. Thank you! I am strongly considering a subscription, but the free version has everything that I really need, so don’t let that scare you off from downloading it :)"
11,11,5,2019-05-25T04:46:53.000Z,this is marshall,The only food tracking app I have consistently used with success,This app is a game changer and I’m so happy I found it. I have struggled with binge eating and an unhealthy relationship with food for the better part of my life. The app is like a picture food journal that lets me track what I eat and the emotions that go along with it. In turn my entire perspective on eating has changed and I have developed a healthy and mindful eating pattern. If you are struggling with disordered eating this is the app you’re looking for. Even if you’re just trying to loose weight and be mindful of what you eat THIS IS THE APP YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. I have tried other food tracking apps and they don’t compare to this one. It’s super helpful too that they give you a day “recap” where you can see what you ate and what you were feeling/why you ate at the time. This will help anyone’s fitness journey. 😊
12,12,5,2019-06-02T14:12:02.000Z,jennah rae,Total Game Changer! 👍🏽👍🏽,"This app has become a cherished part of my every meal. It helps me to be mindful of the food choices I make by gently reminding to put as much thought in my choice of food as I would my choice of clothing for the day. I am so proud of myself when I hit that “On Path” button, it’s motivation in itself to make healthier choices. But even when I do go “Off Path”, this app obliterates the usual shame and guilt I would normally feel and helps me treat myself better."
13,13,5,2020-08-25T18:02:27.000Z,MarcelainC,Best app I’ve used,I have used numerous apps of this kind and I’ve determined that I cannot stand counting calories. It’s draining and it gives me bad anxiety. I honestly believe that counting calories can trigger eating disorders for some.
14,14,5,2020-10-25T13:40:14.000Z,Mountain Life Mom,Simple in all the right ways,"I heard about this app from a nutrition coach who uses it with some of her clients. I struggle to use food diaries because I am on the go constantly at work, frequently eating two meals at the office, often with colleagues around, and often I can’t prepare them. So the idea that I can stop, write down a bunch of stuff, look up its nutritional values, etc, has never worked. Enter Ate. You can snap a picture of your food with two clicks (one to open the app, one to shoot), and it’s already at an appropriate angle to capture your plate so it’s very discreet too. Then click once more for whether it’s on or off your “path” and you’re done. You can write in things you forgot and I really like the simple questions you can answer to add detail. I haven’t used all the features yet but I am starting with being able to capture 100% of my food each day, which is a great success."
15,15,5,2020-08-30T11:20:33.000Z,DogsRfun45678,It’s ALL about mindful eating.,"I’ve been using the app for about a week now.  Formerly I was using My Fitness Pal and sometimes WW.  The thing I like about the Ate app is that it totally makes you think about what you’re putting into your mouth.  You’re mindful in a way I never was with those other apps.  It also makes me feel totally in control of what I’m eating and makes me feel powerful.  I like that I’m not tied to a calorie number.  When I was tied to a number, I’d find myself eating things just because I had calories “left” in the day.  Now, I’m more likely to focus on whether I’m actually hungry or not.   That’s sort of the key and the hardest thing for most of us that struggle with weight.  If we could just stop eating as soon as we aren’t hungry anymore, then no one would be overweight.   That thought is life changing but very difficult to actually do when a donut is staring you in the face!"
16,16,5,2020-07-01T16:54:53.000Z,Happy Plate,Motivating!,"I have only been using this app for one week, but I love it so far!This app is so motivational! I have set a path to focus on eating small healthy meals throughout the day- choosing a variety of veggies,fruits and healthy protein! I love how easy it is to snap a picture to log my eating. I can easily see what and how often I ate throughout the day. Stopping to take a photo before I eat something really makes me more thoughtful about what I put in my body. I have also loved plating  my food to make a “pretty” picture - instead of snacking out of a bag, I take the time to plate my snacks now! It’s actually fun! I love the questions that are asked after eating- I have really focused now on eating at a table not on the couch or in the car.  I rarely eat with my phone or while watching TV, I enjoy my food and listen to my body more when I feel satisfied- rather than stuffed or the bowl is empty!"
17,17,5,2019-09-26T15:56:06.000Z,Ihatethisgame;(,THANK YOU 🙌,I used to use myfitness pal like it was my job. I developed a horrible eating disorder as I constantly was concerned about exactly how many calories I put in my body and terrified if I couldn’t track it. This app is a lifesaver.
18,18,4,2020-01-22T18:02:33.000Z,Ornery-Rutabaga,Love the simplicity!,"I have wished for a long time for an app that would give me a way to track my food without listing individual ingredients or requiring calorie counts before meals could be logged. I am so glad to have found the Ate app! The design is brilliant and as easy as it gets. I appreciate the questions to answer after each meal, especially the two, “Why did you eat?” and “How did it make you feel?” That has been an interesting exercise for me to think about after eating, and helpful for changing some of my habits. I also appreciate how easy it is to scroll back through the past days/weeks to look over what I was eating and be able to see how my meals are changing over time. I find it incredibly motivating. I have tried multiple apps for food tracking, and always gradually dropped off from using them. But, with the simplicity of this one, I expect to be using it years from now."
19,19,4,2020-07-16T17:37:37.000Z,brinnydrew,Almost Perfect Food Journal!,"It’s a really fantastic app, there’s a lot I like about it - for example it uses data from your camera roll to date your food inputs if you upload photos that way, but you can still easily change the date and time of meal inputs manually if need be. I also like the “recap” function for seeing my daily progress all in one place. LOVE that it tracks my fasts between days too."
20,20,5,2018-01-05T15:00:50.000Z,MdlnJam,Down 17lbs and counting,"This app is amazing. I’m someone who has tried EVERY diet and fitness app out there and nothing has been as effective as this app. I’ve lost 17lbs since I started using the app a little over a month ago and I’m still losing. The best part is you can customize your goals for you, you aren’t forced to eat or not eat any foods. I’m still eating whatever I want, but the mindfulness questions for every meal are helping me realize what foods make me feel good. If I get off track of the path I created for myself, it isn’t the end of the world and I don’t binge on ice cream like I would with other diets. I just try to be more mindful during the next meal. Mindfulness really is key to being able to make smart choices in any situation, and I’m so grateful for this app! THANK YOU FOR YOUATE, DEVELOPERS! It really works!"
21,21,5,2018-09-13T18:10:16.000Z,NMessina,Love this visual food diary app!,"This app is a fantastic way for you to keep track of what you’re eating in the most non-judgmental way possible. No calorie counting, no need to give excessive amount of information concerning the ingredients of what you’re eating, just a simple picture and you’re done. The on/off path feature is a great way to hold yourself accountable without shame. Once you take a picture you can click on it and fill out information of where you’re eating and how you’re feeling, among other questions. Only thing I would ask for is that you can add more words in this section. Sometimes I eat when I’m anxious but it doesn’t mean I’m stressed. But it’s a minor thing. I truly love this app and I really appreciate how mindful it’s made me when it comes to my meals."
22,22,5,2019-03-15T18:55:21.000Z,Giselle J.O.Y.,Awesome! LOVE this app!,"I’ve always hated logging what I eat because it’s too tedious, time consuming & detailed. But YouAte makes it so quick & easy. All you have to do is snap a quick pic. Even if you don’t enter it that moment you can go back whenever, import the pic & it will automatically enter the time you took the pic. I love the reflection questions as well that help you think more about why and how you’re eating. It also has a pie graph to show you how much of your eating is for what reasons & it keeps great stats on how much time you go between meals. The layout is simple and attractive. This app makes food journaling/logging/tracking so much fun! You can even share it with friends to keep each other accountable & encourage friends in eating better! LOVE that! Everyone should be using this app!"
23,23,5,2019-04-30T20:29:26.000Z,Bill Merchant,Aid to mindful eating,"I’ve tried zillions of diets and apps over the years, losing weight fast or slow, but usually gaining it back. I’m convinced that the only way to achieve and maintain a healthy weight is by being mindful of what you’re eating, how much you’re eating, and when you’re eating."
24,24,5,2019-05-02T18:07:55.000Z,Sawyer008,Easy App,"This app is working for me. I really needed a break from the journaling world, but didn’t want to just stop paying attention to what I was eating. This app is the perfect answer. If you know how to snap a pic, then you can use this app. I love the freedom I feel when I prepare my meal and don’t have to break down every. Single. Ingredient."
25,25,5,2020-05-13T12:27:11.000Z,kelynpeanut,Perfect Balance,"I’ve tried every diet on the planet. I used to think it was fun tracking my macros. In the end it’s nothing but a obsession & for  WHAT? Possibly losing a couple pounds, weighing & measuring everything only to eat dinner at a friends house & blow the whole thing. Let’s face it that’s no fun. So I tried keto no thanks, next OMAD with no restrictions that was the best so far however I found myself overeating & hungry by mid afternoon & obsessing over dinner. I’m one of those people who like to try different ways to eat and I have a love- hate relationship with tracking it. I found this app & I'm still intermittent fasting using a more intuitive approach & making my first afternoon meal smaller then I can have a normal size dinner & I’m not starving. Taking pictures is perfect because I can get a visual which honestly is more than sufficient to see how I’m doing. This app is Awesome!!"
26,26,5,2019-09-30T23:27:45.000Z,LotusGirl59,Finally!,"I really love this app. I needed a way to watch and be aware of my eating that didn’t make me feel restricted, guilty, controlled or so seriously eating disordered that I became paralyzed and consumed by fear. I know what to do, but totally resist being “ told” or managed by someone else. This app lets me choose MY path and focus on what I know I want to work on. There is no frowny face or judgement when I wobble... just a little jog in my path. Photographing my meals instead of entering what I ate one by one on a list totally works for me and gives me a visual way to see if I ate enough color during the day. There is no target other than on path or off,  and a percentage that I can improve on tomorrow. When I’m at a loss for what to eat, I’ve got a whole gallery of previous meals I can refer to. Thanks for making my food life easier!"
27,27,5,2019-07-19T01:12:22.000Z,snailmaill,ate (8) out of five stars 😉,"This is one of my all-time favorite apps. Instead of tracking calories, taking pictures has made it so much easier to think about why and how I am eating. It makes me more likely to eat because I’m hungry, than eat because I have calories left for the day. The creators of ate have obviously put so much thought into designing this app, and it shows! I love looking back at pictures of what I ate in previous days (and I like making my plates look pretty too!). The graphs of how you have been eating are so helpful, and they have every kind of graph that I could want to see. I talked my mother into doing it with me, and it’s been a blast to see what she’s eating from her point of view. Thank you so much for this app, developers! I would highly recommend it. 🍏"
28,28,5,2021-04-21T17:46:33.000Z,C.Nordic,Great app!,"I am enjoying being able to see the daily recap, *in living color* photos of what all I eat in a day, and how it fits into my goal of eating more veggies, and thus just more healthy eating. The mindful eating concept is especially so important for those of us still working remotely, and who have a well stocked kitchen just a few steps away :) Making wiser choices, and being aware of timing as well, are so important!"
29,29,5,2020-07-14T04:13:58.000Z,brightaide,Great for binge eaters,I love this app! I had fitness pal and other calorie counting apps but I will always forget to record what I ate. Taking the pic before each meal it’s so much easier to remember. Not only that it helps me to see how much I’ve been eating I love that I can scroll and see if I had sugar that week and it gets you to the root of your problem. So every time you snap a pic you can add tags of how that meal made you feel and the app creates pie graph of why you eat. I also like that it gives you the time in between each meal perfect if this is important for your type of diet like a fasting diet. So there is no way to track calories and I don’t mind bucease for me now portion control is what i need so this works great I want to upgrade but i don’t know if is it worth it. But i love it so far
30,30,5,2017-11-25T14:50:26.000Z,Frenchfrai,Painless (and fun!) awareness,"I downloaded this app instead of going to calorie counting or a fad diet (both of which I was considering). It’s been wonderful! I can easily snap a photo of my meals and there’s a fun and encouraging component to getting to capture my choices. It makes me want to make BETTER choices. You get to retroactively log why you ate, where you ate and how you felt which has given me an overall better awareness of my eating habits and I’ve since been able to cut back eating when I’m bored and not hungry. It’s helps promote self compassion because you can always get back on path if you choose an off path meal or snack. Lastly, I get to see my stats week to week, like how “on path” I’ve been towards the goals I got to set and how much time I usually go between meals."
31,31,5,2018-04-28T07:07:25.000Z,Hurrah!,So lovely and effortless.,"First off, no calorie counting! That’s the main reason I appreciate this app. In my experience, counting calories doesn’t work. I forget all about what a “meal” is and don’t think about what I want. But with this app, I get to be simple, crate meals I will enjoy and even make them presentable since I know I’m going to take a photo for my journal. Also, it really has a beautiful interface! I love the color scheme. What’s nice is the app encourages you to decide for yourself whether your “on path” or “off path” and to evaluate you reasons for eating each meal, how you feel, and how the food was. Just a simple and helpful way to watch what you eat without obsessing over calories. I am glad they made YouAte! Thanks you guys!"
32,32,5,2018-07-22T16:58:00.000Z,rose m w,Healing my relationship with foid,This app is a fantastic way to set healthy food goals and have accountability without counting calories or becoming obsessive with weight. Ive had some emotional and mental issues surrounding weight and eating and this app is allowing me to track my food for my nutritionist without negatively impacting my sense of self worth. It also really has helped me stop judging when I go “off path”. It takes away a lot if the shame about eating unhealthy food bc I can see it as being “off path” instead of “I am bad for eating this”.
33,33,5,2018-07-24T17:28:25.000Z,💗PH💗,This app changed everything for me!,"Such a simple concept. That we don’t need to count calories to lose weight. That by simply looking at photos of what we’ve eaten, we can instantly tell if we’ve eaten too much or just enough, and if what we’re eating consists of nutrition-packed calories or empty calories. I’ve lost 9 pounds so far, am absolutely not on a diet, do not feel deprived, and have never eaten better! Having to take a picture of everything I eat greatly encourages me to choose colorful, healthy options, pay more attention to portion sizes, and to think twice about whether I really want to eat something. It’s also very reinforcing to look back at my food choices and feel proud of them. I love this app!"
34,34,5,2018-10-19T13:39:02.000Z,katherinemal,Love this easy to use app,"This is app is wonderful! It’s so easy to use, all you do is take a picture or type in what you ate, say if its on path or not, then say how it made you feel! I like that i can see how my day went and that I don’t have to count calories. I’ve tried a lot of different food tracking apps and most are complicated to keep track of everything. This makes me feel like I’m in control and I don’t let a silly number of calories I’m allowed a day control me. Seeing that I ate something good for me makes me want to eat something healthy again, if i ate something not so good then i know at my next meal to step it up and make it a good choice! I would like to see more options under how did it make you feel."
35,35,5,2019-05-19T17:02:31.000Z,HopDMH,What a relief!,"I’ve been on one diet or another since I was a teenager, losing and regaining the same 20 pounds over and over again. Now at age 59, I am tired of devoting so much of my precious time to counting calories and obsessing over food - always feeling guilty. This app is perfect! ATE helps me to be intentional about my eating and allows for all the reasons I might choose to eat that have nothing to do with hunger or health - and decide that’s my path - right for me. I feel as though a huge burden has lifted and I’m enjoying my life and my food. ATE is like a visual diary of my day - without a score or judgement. It’s a place that allows for curiosity and wonder and honesty rather than shame and doubt. I’m learning to trust myself with the help of this app."
36,36,5,2020-03-27T19:50:04.000Z,unknown9.0,"Useful, simple, insightful","It’s a simple app to use, which makes it so convenient to be consistent with. Snap a picture, enjoy your meal, and come back to reflect on what you’ve eaten. Do it enough times throughout the day and at the end of the day, you can look back at everything you've eaten. It really gives you a reality check (if you’re good about photographing everything you eat) on how you eat throughout the day. It’s a great tool to have at your disposal if you’re aiming to be a more conscious eater, without the mental stress that calorie counting apps might give you. It really has you focus more on the quality of foods you eat and if those align with your food goals, rather than simply eating anything (healthy or not) as long as it meets a calorie amount at the end of the day."
37,37,5,2021-01-05T18:47:33.000Z,gcinfern,Loving this App!,"After trying out a few apps where you have to laboriously enter every item you eat, I found that to be to time consuming & realized I didn’t care about calories & pie charts that didn’t really seem on target.  What I really wanted was an online food journal to track what I ate daily.  Although I’ve only been using the app for a couple of weeks I’m really enjoying the ease of just snapping a pic & moving on with my day.  You can go back in & rate your meals with a Q&A section, if you choose.  If I do think about eating something unhealthy I’ve asked myself if I really want that pic in my daily recap.  It’s a small thing, but it does make you stop & think.  All in all,I’m enjoying the app &definitely plan on continuing to use it."
38,38,5,2019-11-09T00:10:41.000Z,Groundhog67,It’s just right!,"I love the flexibility of this app! As a person who struggles with disordered eating but has other health issues that require I “watch what I eat,” this app is a perfect way to see what I’m eating and then make adjustments according to how I feel. I don’t want to count calories or measure things. I don’t need any kind of guilt layered on how much I already beat myself up. I just want to be able to look back and know what I ate. I want to collect data. I set up my goal to be “see my food” so that I’m 100% on the path all the time. Every now and then I forget the photo before I eat the food, but I’m able to just enter the text. The app is neither overly cute nor clinical. Ate passes the Goldilocks test: “it’s just right.” Thank you, Piqniq!"
39,39,5,2021-01-03T22:39:02.000Z,hhb7991,The best food tracking app,"This is the best app I’ve used for tracking what I eat. For people recovering from an eating disorder, this app is very helpful. It promotes intuitive eating, mindfulness, and accountability. I like the photo tracking method because it makes me want to eat food that is visually appealing, like a pretty salad, instead of just eating a bag of chips or something. It also helps me track the frequency of my meals really easily and non judgmentally (some apps pressure you to eat more frequently, which is really difficult when you are in recovery). It is nice to find an eating app that has nothing to do with calories or weight. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to track their eating in a healthy way."
40,40,5,2018-04-17T23:26:40.000Z,joycedbbg,I wish I had this years ago!,"I’m recovering from some disordered eating issues, and counting calories is always a big no no. However I find it very difficult to eat healthy without tracking—this app is the perfect fit for me and way more convenient than keeping a physical food journal on me at all times. The pictures are so much better than measuring and counting every little thing in the foods I make at home. I’ve already lost half an inch around my waist in around 9 days because of this apps support of my mindful eating. So thrilled I happened upon this app and i recommend it to anyone struggling to make the right food choices. Staying on path feels so good and so easy with Ate!"
41,41,5,2018-09-21T02:11:34.000Z,kelseybell5619,Awesome and SIMPLE,"This is a great food journal app - whether you want details or just a quick picture to remind you of what you’ve ate it’s perfect. I personally need a simple tracker of what I’m eating. I don’t need to document every single calorie or carb, but I do want to keep track of what I’m eating. The pictures make it simple too. Plus you can go back and choose why you ate it, where, was it good, are you full, etc. You also get to set goals and why you’re doing this... it’s just an awesome food journal ... so much easier then others... like MyFitnessPal — way to much freaking work! With this you have the option to add in that stuff or not and just track your food!!"
42,42,5,2019-04-08T22:47:03.000Z,Katiearina,Great for Whole 30 and food tracking if CICO isn't your focus!,"To be perfectly honest, I usually use MyFitnessPal to track my food because for the past almost-year I've been tracking my calorie intake and it has helped me lose weight."
43,43,5,2021-01-25T22:29:03.000Z,Evilmom lady,"It’s about the food, not the calories",Initially looked at this app for my child with an ED.  I needed something for them to track their food without getting messages about losing weight.
44,44,5,2021-01-13T20:33:08.000Z,Live life bro,amazing!,"My boyfriend has been trying to get my to keep track of my diet for years, and he uses my fitness pal. I personally dislike my fitness, I’m fairly healthy and I just got sad over the calorie counting. BUT THIS APP IS AMAZING. It really just makes you think more so about WHAT you’re eating and making you really thing about what you SHOULD eat over typical alternatives. It’s super user friendly, and it’s much more of a simplistic healthy mentality of just choosing healthier meals. AND I LOVE THE GOALS YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM AND TBE OPTIONS TO MAKE YOUR OWN.  Plus I convinced my friends do it with my, which makes it more fun to share the healthy meals we’ve been eating! (the only downside is water tracking is part of the premium version)"
45,45,5,2020-08-27T00:59:57.000Z,Wastensouls,Building a healthy relationship with food!,"I’ve struggled with an unhealthy view of food for as long as I can remember. I’ve tried multiple “fad” diets... and all failed, of course. None of them focused on fixing the real issues. Calorie counting, macro tracking, etc just exacerbates obsessive thoughts for me to the point I just give up and feel miserable. But this app! I’m so happy to have found it. I needed a photo food journal, for accountability, but this app has so much more. The questions help you dig into the important stuff...why am I eating? This has helped me watch my level of emotional eating and pay attention to my hunger signals, which is critical for intuitive eating. Thanks to the Ate team. Keep up the great work!"
46,46,5,2020-08-14T18:48:04.000Z,fojlz,Fun,"I picked up this app on a lark more to keep a diary of the amazing food my partner has been cooking up during quarantine than to diet. I set my goal to “yum yum yum yum.” But since I’ve started using it, I realize that it does help me keep track of my portion sizes and how often I’m eating things I need to reduce, like sweets. The interface is easy to use, and I’ve yet to run into a problem. Moreover, there are no ads and the entire thing is very tastefully done — some apps feel like cynical cash grabs which are intentionally unpleasant to use. This app is the very opposite of that. It’s, dare I say it, relaxing? Can you really call a food diary app relaxing? Somehow it really is! It’s just a really positive experience: give it a try."
47,47,5,2019-09-30T19:56:07.000Z,Telocin1,On Path!,"Are you “On Path”? It’s a simple question, but it answers everything in a nutshell. I’m not great about taking the photos but I always log with the text feature. This app came to me at the perfect time. I’m listening to “Phit N Phat podcast and they highly recommend journaling. This app is a perfect way for me to track my eating and my eating habits. I’m having a health issue unrelated to weight and/or weight loss. I’m trying to track down what the trigger is and if it is in fact food related. Journal is definitely helping me align my symptoms with what I have been consuming. And I am getting better about taking pictures. It’s so quick, then I can put my phone away and enjoy my meal."
48,48,5,2020-05-09T20:37:49.000Z,starkaudio,Great option to keep you honest with yourself!,"My wife and I started using the app at the suggestion of our nutritionist. We struggle with portion control and food choices and she suggested “Ate” as a way to log our portion sizes as well as what we’re eating. Neither of us like to write down every little thing in a food log, but taking a photo of our plate whenever we eat makes it easy! We think it’s a success so far for us because it’s a gentle reminder at meal times when we take that photos to moderate and make better choices. Plus the ability to share our timelines with each other as well as our nutritionist makes it easy to get support and encouragement."
49,49,4,2021-02-18T17:42:37.000Z,Too coolll,Great app so far,"I am currently trying to break out of excessive calorie counting, and this app allows me to continue the habit of tracking my meals without obsessing over numbers. I love the encouragement to be mindful about your emotions and why you are eating as well. The only thing keeping this app from being 5 stars for me is the inability to turn off intermittent fasting information. Intermittent fasting may work for some people, but can rapidly devolve into triggering harmful behaviors for people who are prone to/recovering from disordered eating (Ex. could trigger trying to extend fasts for longer periods of time). Given that otherwise this app seems like a great alternative to traditional meal tracking apps for folks with EDs, I wish that information could be optional."
50,50,5,2017-12-13T04:38:19.000Z,Chris385626294846,So simple it works,"Simple and perfect! I’ve tried similar apps and what makes this one stand out is that it doesn’t take up exorbitant storage space. This will make you reflect on why you ate and how you feel about it, removing any judgement and not imposing any limits. This works for me: If I’m setting the rules then I’m responsible for following the rules. It’s helped me overcome overeating. It has made me aware of timing of meals for intermittent fasting. The company seems respectful of users, in thoughtful app design and limited emails that you can opt out of. If it’s not a functionality, it’d be nice to see stats like how many meals I was bored, percentage of meals in the car. Otherwise, great app, recommended 110%."

52,52,5,2018-10-12T14:28:49.000Z,Ageless Goddess,Perfect!,"LOVE this app. (I heard about it via a healthy living podcast..so grateful!) I can easily track my food choices, either by picture or text, without doing any measuring. It also lets me make quick notations about my meals. Because of this, I find I’m willing to be accountable with my food choices without judging myself. It tracks fasting times, allowing me to delete an app I previously used. I upgraded to the premium , much cheaper than other food premium apps, which allows me to track liquids and activities. It syncs seamlessly with my Apple health info.  So very easy to use. The support staff responds very quickly with any questions. Well done!"
53,53,5,2019-02-17T18:05:56.000Z,BeccaAnnH,Love this app!!,"Mindfulness is the key to any attempt and/or success in changing behavior, and YouAte is the perfect app for focusing your attention. I have had an unhealthy relationship with food for a long time. In fact, it borders on addiction and obsessiveness. With YouAte, I love just snapping a picture of what I’m eating and in the moment assessing how I feel about the meal. No more counting points or writing every single thing down. Also, because I am a competitive person, I don’t want to go “off path”, so this helps keep me on the straight & narrow. I’m still using the free app because this is working for me.  If you are a “visual” person, I guarantee you will love this app!"
54,54,5,2019-05-30T19:10:21.000Z,Alyssa Burns,So helpful!,"I highly recommend this app for anyone who wants to be more aware of what they’re eating throughout the day and the times they eat. It’s a great first step towards a lifestyle change and helps keep you accountable for what you’re eating, how much, and how it makes you feel. I feel inclined to make better decisions already! I am 19 and with school, work, and social activities it can be easy to fall off track or keep snacking, but with this app it has helped me to be more disciplined and focus on portion control. I wouldn’t want a bunch of pictures of unhealthy, prepackaged foods on my path. I love this app a lot and I’m excited to see the results it helps me to achieve."
55,55,5,2020-02-12T18:58:38.000Z,OC Toulouse-Lautrec,done with counting,"i am on a mission to mindful eating. i don’t want to diet, change my body, etc. i do want to feel physically better and to be intentional about what i eat. Ate was a godsend in a world full of calorie counting (or “macro” counting, same difference). i love that i can be accountable to myself without measuring myself. and i’ve only been using it about a week but it’s already helping me begin to pause before mindlessly grazing off my toddler’s plate or out of a bag of chips. so i can enjoy my snacks and meals by taking a second to put them on a plate or at least to snap a photo before putting them in my mouth. i hope apps like ate are future of nutritious, body positive eating :)"
56,56,5,2020-03-07T18:15:05.000Z,Meg8418,Fantastic app for Intuitive Eating!,"I’ve been on the diet roller coaster forever and recently wanted to try intuitive eating. I found this app by searching the App Store for Intuitive Eating and I have been blown away by how much this app has helped me stay on track! You simply take photos of everything you eat and at the end of the day you can see a collage of everything you ate that day. You can also easily note your hunger level, where you ate, mood/satisfaction after eating along with your photo. It’s so easy to log meals and so effective for keeping me honest and on track. I’ve been logging for a week now and have already lost 3 lbs! Great app!"
57,57,5,2020-10-14T23:22:40.000Z,kate8mindfully!,Mindful & No Counting Calories!,"Because of this app, I’m more reflective when I eat now. I’m more purposeful and aware of eating. Counting calories on other apps has messed with my guilt & nutritional density intake. When I’ve eaten mindlessly, this app helps avoid the downward spiral of hopelessness and continuation of bad habits. I can hop back “on path” because I have a birds-eye view of the past few days of success."

59,59,5,2020-06-02T23:34:01.000Z,spangeob,Everything about this app is perfect,"Traditional calorie-counting apps have caused my eating habits to become disordered in the past, but I also struggle with accountability if I don’t keep track at all. Ate is simple enough that I don’t get lost in grams and macros, but open-ended enough that I can really set and track any goal for myself. The UI is gorgeous and intuitive. It has a crazy amount of different options and not a lot of flipping through menus trying to find those options. I’m honestly considering buying a premium subscription because I love the amount of thought put into this app even though I don’t need any of the premium features"
60,60,5,2017-10-03T01:19:04.000Z,Realst8ace,The Best Food Diary!,My husband and I started a new eating and exercise program which includes recording your daily food intake. On the first day we we're manually recording our meals when I discovered this app. With the snap of your camera you can photograph what you ate and even make notes. It times the gaps between meals too. If you forgot to snap a photo you can add a text entry with the note and time. The only thing I haven't figured out is how to add a photo after the fact with the right time (I accidentally took a pic outside the app and couldn't log it in ). That is a small thing in exchange for the convenience of the food diary.
61,61,5,2018-10-19T03:16:03.000Z,Jkingpet,The BEST food journal app!,"I LOVE this app! I am working with a nutritionist who wanted me to take photos of what I was eating. I find that I am way more honest with (and actually remember) what I eat with this app. I especially love how you can document the when, where, and why with the photo. And, a REALLY helpful feature is that it documents frequency/time between eating...with summaries at the end of each day. I would love it if this tied to my other calorie tracking food journal (myfitnesspal), but I totally don’t mind documenting in two worlds either...one is visual/emotional documentation, the other is more data driven. GREAT idea...I rave about this app a ton!"
62,62,5,2019-01-04T20:35:24.000Z,Ma Fea,Grateful for this,"I’ve only been using this for a week, so I’m in that “first blush of love” stage, but so far, this has been just what I was hoping for-convenient, yet effective."
63,63,5,2020-02-05T19:21:44.000Z,allywaqksjedb,Lovely food tracker app,I went from obsessing over my calories to this app. This app enables me to not feel guilty over calories but it makes me eat more mindful. I seriously can self reflect and see what time of the day I cheat my diet and why. I love this app and am so grateful I found it!
64,64,5,2020-12-22T19:22:20.000Z,CM0914,Nice job simple & effective,Good app! 🙂 It’s a great tool for those who want to be more mindful about their eating patterns without having to log calories etc. Super quick & easy! Also I find it helpful when I can’t think of what to cook or my husband wants a meal I made previously - I just scroll up on my logs to help me remember the meal/ingredients. One thing that I think could be improved is when you go to your day recap if you posted more than one photo within the time frame it only shows one of those photos in the recap rather then the full recap of every photo taken. Could you guys adjust this please?! Thanks ☺️
65,65,5,2020-07-29T03:36:01.000Z,alex h 92,Really balanced approach,"It’s simple, like Instagram, which makes it easy to adopt and get your bearings."
66,66,4,2020-01-21T19:30:50.000Z,sandosis,"Good app, but could (easily) be great","I like the simplicity of the app and the non-shaming aspect of being honest about recording less than healthy eating habits. What would make it great, would be the ability to download the pictures of foods with the associated time/place/feelings, so you can more easily revisit and see the details about the less than healthy eating episodes. This would make it much, much easier to come up with appropriate coping skills to handle those episodes. The graphs are great, but I’d like to download a linear timetable of food and emotions to look for patterns. I’d also like categories of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks to better understand true hunger eating vs. emotional eating. Thanks!"
67,67,4,2020-08-16T19:19:49.000Z,Slytherin07,"Non judgmental, complete, easy","This is definitely the best food tracker out there. I love the ability to add your own questions. However a few things I would change: add an electrolyte option for liquids, it is very difficult to add multiple pictures to the same meal: I changed my settings so that pictures taken in the same hour count in the same meal, but it’s still not working. There should be a way to upload multiple pictures to the same meal at once. This short falling of the app makes me feel guilty for having “seconds” which is very negative (it’s ok to have seconds!!). Also there is no way to track macros which is annoying."
68,68,5,2020-08-19T16:52:32.000Z,jade et,Great meal tracking app,A couple of weeks ago I was searching for a meal tracking app because I didn’t want to count calories but I still wanted to keep track of what I was eating. I tried SHYE but I didn’t like the lack of flexibility with meals and that you have to pay to save your meals after a certain date. Ate is much more flexible and gives a great visual representation of your food. I also like that I can write notes about my food and choose the circumstances and emotions I felt at the time of eating. This allows me to look back on my day and see what can be improved (or just drool over all the good food I ate!)
69,69,5,2021-06-17T22:51:21.000Z,TurtleJogger,Non-judgmental breeds honesty,I love how this app is non-judgmental and so customizable.
70,70,3,2018-07-11T16:57:44.000Z,asch58,Like the app but wish there were a few other features,I really like this app overall. I wanted to keep track of what I was eating without counting calories or trying to look up really specific food items. I love the on/off path function. It’s motivating to me to try to be “on path” 100% of the day. I really wish though that you could either: indicate a meal is a snack and/or indicate that you are slightly off path vs. way off path. Let’s say I eat a small portion of something that I feel to be off path. It affects my percentage of on/off path the same as an entire off path meal would. I would like to be able to indicate that I ate something small that was off path but see that it was only a minority of my day.

72,72,4,2018-11-03T17:58:59.000Z,absie10724,"Good app, small tweaks could improve it","I like this app a lot! I understand why they have to charge for the versions that allow you to track activity, but I wish that feature were included in the free version... for now I just take a photo of my workout and add it to my day. I think the app would also benefit from allowing more write-in stuff in each little category. For instance, writing more specifically how something makes me feel after eating as opposed to picking one pre-picked word or little emoji.. sometimes I have a mix of feelings or whatever. I’m hoping that sticking with this for a while allows me to identify more in terms of my eating and binge patterns, triggers, etc."
73,73,5,2020-02-28T02:38:36.000Z,Jennaberri,Helping with emotional eating,"So, I’m struggling with emotional eating. Just stopping and reflecting on my feelings about my meals through the “feelings” pop up, which asks questions like where you were, who with, restaurant and hunger level. Just seeing what I’m eating and understanding the feelings that food gives (or not) is helping my underlying issues with why I’m eating outside of hunger. It’s also helping me healthily transition away from calorie counting and just looking at how much food I’m consuming and how often. It’s been a week and I love it. I feel so much more in tune with my emotions and less prone to eat because of stress."
74,74,5,2019-11-19T21:59:08.000Z,Medicine is Food,Great app for tracking,"The app works best with people in your group to share and discuss options. The interface with your friends could be improved, where a comment could be shared or recipe by text or by url, on the same page as the picture.  However, I love the fact that it is not about calories.  If calories in vs calories out was truly that simple, than it would be that simple to change a lifestyle just as simple.  People are catching on that other factors play a bigger role and research is supporting these finds.  Ate is ahead of most trackers at this time, at the forefront of modern dietary thinking.  Great work!"
75,75,5,2021-01-27T00:39:59.000Z,Lisadunston,Ate is a keeper!,"I think I’m probably in the same boat as everyone else as far as trying tons and tons of other food diaries and not enjoying them. Counting calories is such a tedious and daunting task. I hate feeling bad about what I eat. This app is designed to remind us that we are human and food is meant to be enjoyed and remembered. My favorite feature of the app is the notes/Q&A within your food logs. The Q&A doesn’t ask for calories, nutritional facts or anything of the sort. It just simply wants to know what did you eat and how did it make you feel. Definitely recommending this app to friends and colleagues! Thank you, Ate!"

With the friends option she is able to see what I am eating, and can now help me see why I might be loosing weight and what we can add to maintain a healthy weight."
77,77,5,2020-07-07T18:45:46.000Z,ChrisItaly,Easy Breezy!,I’ve struggled with my weight most of my life. I tried all kinds of diets and programs throughout the years. What I LOVE about this app is that I can food journal without the soul-crushing experience of having to add quantities and calories and search for foods online and measure and weigh everything!! That always sucked all the joy out of eating for me! Having a visual record of what I ate is a game-changer (and I’m middle-aged so I’ve played ALL the games before 😁). It has made me more mindful and it has simplified everything. I’m down about 5 pounds in just a few days. I just really love the way this works for me! 😃😍😁
78,78,5,2021-07-25T14:35:30.000Z,excited about food,Ate!,"This is a great app. It is easy to use offline which is a plus for me. I like how it gives different experiments to work on and challenge you. These experiments are explained and help you think in a unique way. After you eat you are given questions about why, where, whom, and the such you ate. This is a great way to track your mode, your reasons for eating and helps you become aware of your habits. I’m very pleased with Ate. The best part is that you don’t have to have the premium access to exceed. Thank you for all your hard work by making this app so user friendly."
79,79,5,2019-07-23T19:20:48.000Z,bethnomdeguerre,Great for mindful eating,"Like others, I have done several programs in an attempt to eat healthfully and control my weight."

I’ve been trying to eat healthier, and wanted a way to track my food without stressing myself out over calories and macronutrients and all the other data food-tracking apps collate. YouAte is perfect: when I snap a pic, it makes me remember what I’m actually eating, the short reflection questions help me consider why I am choosing a particular food (and if there was a better choice I could have made), and the “path” set-up is guilt-free and allows me to evaluate what’s on track for me. It’s the best way to mindfully track food without tracking calories."
81,81,5,2018-07-20T20:48:08.000Z,charcharblancNC,Finally an app that gets it!,"I stumbled upon the Ate app while looking for something simple to help me keep track of what I eat. I do like “the other” popular app but find that tracking calories hasn’t helped me. The Ate app is great for figuring out the WHY behind eating. Eating is good! Eat to live and live to eat - but do so in a way to be healthy and happy. We are all taking pictures of our food anyway, why not do it to better ourselves? It’s simple, and I think about whether I’d rather report back with picture of a donut that I ate, or a spinach omelette that fed my soul and nourished me. Well done!"
82,82,5,2021-02-02T21:20:55.000Z,GloriaG,Great for changing behavior,"A month with this app and I improved my eating behavior and dropped some pounds. Like many food apps it serves to “correct” you just through the act of tracking (“Do I really want to log that?”) Unlike other food tracking apps I didn’t feel a sense of “failure” if I blew past some calorie (or carb, or whatever) goal. It was also nice and easy to do a picture, and I found on days I did really well I felt a sense of satisfaction looking back on the day in review and seeing all that healthy food. This helped to reinforce positive behavior as opposed to eliminate “bad.” Good app!"
83,83,4,2021-02-20T18:45:03.000Z,Mairelys A.,Useful!,"I’ve been using the app for about a month now, and it’s been helpful as I navigate my health goals. It’s helped me identify patterns in in the kinds of foods I’m eating and how much time I’m waiting in between, which is key as I work on balancing my blood sugar. I appreciate that I can share my food diary with an accountability partner. I would however suggest modifying the on track and off track feature to allow a little life nuance. Ex: If I have great nutrients on my plate, but a larger portion of carbs than what I’m aiming for, and waited way too long in between meals, I would be unsure which option to chose, and am unsure if I can opt out if that feature."
84,84,5,2019-06-24T21:04:05.000Z,Fruteria24,"Chill, but super effective food tracking app","I was looking for a food journal app, but tired of tracking calories or quantities. Really happy to find YouAte! As someone who thrives on accountability, I can see what my friends are eating and they can see mine (actual pictures of meals). I also love that the meal photos don’t automatically save to your phone. It’s the perfect way to visually see what you eat, but not have to spend valuable minutes of the day tracking (which was never sustainable for me). Seeing photos of what you are is a really powerful tool. Definitely motivates me."
85,85,5,2020-08-16T17:40:28.000Z,Happy Sea Shell!,Wonderful program that works!,I was impressed with how much info Heather's assist. gathered so 2 perfect coaches could be chosen specifically for me. Met an hour with my mindset coach - she's great - told her my issue and after discussing she said text her anytime I needed support before our next meeting. Love that. My food coach had unique suggestions right off the bat that made a difference! I've dropped 5 lbs in the first week and was not hungry!
86,86,5,2021-06-01T02:44:01.000Z,El Rey Del Mondo,Camera Visually based is the best feature,"I have read some of the critical reviews about trying to bypass the camera feature. I wonder how it would be easier If you have tried to sit down and type in after every meal , snack , water , coffees and so on Vs snapping quick shot, then to quick questionnaire about how you felt, where you ate, how you ate and so forth . Previously I tried and couldn’t. Now I am doing it with great ease and accuracy"
87,87,5,2020-12-31T18:55:33.000Z,katielw,Dev Request - Great app but can we fix the camera permissions limits?,"Love the concept of this and the latest additions! I also love that it works with my Apple Watch. I would use it all the time, but I hate leaving on camera privileges for apps (I trust you guys but just think it’s a good privacy habit in general). If the app let you use it even when the camera permissions were off (say you wanted to do a text entry or just upload photos from your gallery or turn camera permission on sometimes), it would be perfect. Thanks in advance for the consideration!"
88,88,5,2019-09-15T18:49:56.000Z,EmSuz32,So usable,"I love so much about this app. I love that there are so many options provided for what “on track” might look like for any individual; It’s not just a weight loss app, and it’s not tied to a particular fad diet; it is meant to help a person reach their food goals, whatever they are. I also like the little arrow that nudges me back in track. I’ve used a lot of food tracking apps, and this feels the healthiest and the most sustainable. I’d love to see a report included that lets you look at a glance at how on track you’ve been over over several days or weeks."
89,89,5,2020-09-10T16:41:19.000Z,CaylaAdams,Mindful Eating,"I really like this app!! I’m not a fan of calorie counters, but I’m realizing I need to be more intentional about what I’m eating. The goal of “happy and healthy” is perfect, and deciding whether something is “on path” or “off path” towards that goal is completely up to the user. It makes me be reflective, without feeling ashamed or stressed about the exact calorie count. I’m also a big fan of all the statistics it gives me— I feel like I already have a better understanding of my eating habits and have made some important changes that I hope to maintain with this app."
90,90,5,2018-01-04T16:58:23.000Z,maybematilda,Easy and helpful,"I have used calorie counting apps/sites off and on for years. They are absolutely soul-crushing for me. Too time-consuming to use, and they inevitably lead me towards obsessive and disordered eating. I love that this app helps me keep track of what I’m eating and make healthier choices without reducing it to meticulous number tracking. I’m not hugely consistent with using it yet, but I’m improving. I feel better when I use this regularly. Thanks for providing a simple way to help me feel better and choose wisely, without making it all about numbers."
91,91,5,2019-01-10T18:57:53.000Z,TBOKC,Simple!,My doc asked me to provide her with a food diary. I just don’t keep track well so I searched for a simple app to track what I was eating. Nothing was simple!  They all wanted vast info such as macros and carbs and calories. Then I found YouAte. I just snap a picture of my food (or enter a description if I forgot before I started shoveling)!  I just share my day with my doctor and it sends an index picture of my meals to her. The app keeps me on track because I know I don’t want to take a picture of food I should not be eating or food I’m eating due to stress or boredom.
92,92,4,2019-02-10T16:54:41.000Z,Kayakchick,Easy Tracking,"I love, love, love this tracking app. I am not focused on calories so much as I am on listening to my hunger cues and making healthier choices. This app is perfect. I can snap a picture and be done if I’m in a hurry then add notes later when I have time and feel the need. It lets me instantly know how well I’m doing at staying on track. If I forgot to take a pic, I can just put in the text of what I ate. This couldn’t be any easier. The one thing I would change is under How did you fee, I would add a full button. There’s a difference between satisfied, full, and stuffed. Or maybe make it customizable."
93,93,4,2019-03-05T02:39:12.000Z,girls got goals,Fantastic and so easy!,"This is a fantastic app, quick and easy to track what I’m eating and drinking throughout my day without adding each ingredient or scanning everything. I love the ease of quick taking a picture and being able to go back and take note of my food choices."
94,94,5,2019-07-11T11:34:42.000Z,Jcrofo,Love love love,"I love taking photos of my food anyways (especially for my insta) so this was the perfect app for me to track my daily intake. I love that it’s simple, straightforward and there’s not pressure to count calories - am I on path or my goals or not? If I ever forget to upload my photos, I can always go back later. Super simple yet effective. How did I only just find this app????? I also love all the bright fun colors and progress charts and that you can share with friends. After I finish my review, I’m going to upload a photo of my breakfast to my app - smoothie bowl anyone?"
95,95,4,2019-08-07T12:22:26.000Z,KateWV10,It’s working for me,"I’m not really in to calorie counting or dieting in general, but I am trying to get rid of my baby weight so I gave this a chance. I’ve only been using for a week and I am down 2 lbs., which doesn’t seem like much but hey it’s a start in the right direction. This app makes me more mindful of my eating choices and I really think it’s helping me stay on track. I like that it’s so simple and easy to use. I like that my friend and I can motivate each other and chat through the app. My only negative feedback is that I wish there was a section to log fitness just so you can also stay accountable with that."
96,96,5,2019-08-24T05:24:13.000Z,Divya D.,So happy!,"“Ate” was an accidental discovery & what an amazing find... What a wonderful way to food-journal, make notes about my feelings & eating habits, and stay self-motivates, without the self-judgement I often feel from forget food-journaling apps! :) I feel like “Ate” address my total well-being, not just calorie-counting, macros, & exercise, but also my emotions, eating habits, and goals on a much deeper level. And I love that it’s photo-based; Makes tracking everything so much easier cause it’s all visual! A great app for those who want better balance in life & health, not just weight loss. :)"
97,97,4,2021-01-27T16:15:55.000Z,MairienL,Learned to work around it,"When I first started this app I was taking photos and adding them before I ate as the plate look full and one can see what I was eating but I found this is not really accurate. When I look at the time my last ate, it would be off about 30 ish minutes depending on how long I knew it took me to eat. I like being as accurate as I can be on these apps so I can use it to my advantage. So, the solution: I take the photo before I eat and once I take my last bite I will import it with the current time. The new problem? Sometimes I will forget to import the photo later..."
98,98,5,2020-07-06T14:40:20.000Z,wawertz1968,Fantastic App !,I absolutely love this app because I like to put my food into my Cronometer app but I don’t want to do it immediately because I’m busy with other things so I can take a video diary of what I eat and then at the end of my day put it all into my other Cronometer app and really helped track my nutrition for health and wellness it’s so easy it’s so quick and it really gives you an accurate picture of how much you’re eating in the quality your food is right in front of your eyes and don’t forget mindlessly what you’re eating each day
99,99,5,2020-01-01T16:35:06.000Z,MSU4ever,My favorite food diary app!,"If you’re like me, typing every morsel in a food tracking app gets old very quickly. Journaling your food in this app is quick and easy – just take a pic and tap the on- or off-path button. You can also add more details if you choose, such as why you ate and how it made you feel afterwards, which really supports accountability. You can easily see the history of your food choices, which is very helpful. Aesthetically pleasing and straightforward UI/UX. Thank you for developing and continually updating this free, simple, and fun app!"
100,100,5,2017-08-16T20:18:36.000Z,DreahSam,Efficient. Simple & Easy!,Honestly this app is GREAT.
101,101,5,2017-10-04T10:40:33.000Z,Shicks090,MAKES YOU WANT TO IMPROVE!!,"This easy to use app is addictive!!! Just by taking a picture or entering what “you ate” and being honest as to whether it was on “your path” it shows your progress.  It asks simple questions like were you hungry, where were you when you ate, how you felt after.  It really makes you think."
102,102,5,2018-09-17T17:09:43.000Z,Kishma20,Simple and efficient.,"I love this app! It’s a perfect food diary that helps keep me accountable. I don’t have to write anything down, just snap a pic when I’m eating and choose the path. You can even click on the picture and answer a few questions about your meal. Seeing it all laid out before you really helps to put things into perspective and makes me conscious of what I’ve already eaten. If you need all the bells and whistles, you’re in the wrong place. If you want a simple, user-friendly and fun food diary, you should get it!"
103,103,5,2018-11-12T18:40:00.000Z,rebsrondo,A picture is worth 1000 words,I have food journaled in the past and always slack off when it comes to counting calories. It takes a good amount of effort and once you miss a few meals it’s hard to get back on track. Snapping a photo is easy. I’m able to review all of my choices quickly and know whether I’m on track or off track. I love that you can take a photo and it doesn’t store on your device. It only stores on the app. I always seem to be low on memory so that is a great feature.
104,104,5,2019-03-12T18:45:32.000Z,Noelle932,Everything’s included,"Most apps that look helpful have a “bait and switch” technique where they show all of the features in the App Store, but then once you download the app you learn that you can only put in two meals a day, or set up only one notification, or the camera feature is a paid option. Not with this app! It’s easy to use, everything’s included, it doesn’t decide for you what is healthy or unhealthy, and the accountability of tracking what I eat has done wonders for my diet choices. I love this app!"
105,105,4,2019-04-09T19:25:02.000Z,ComeThrough,Love it!!,"This is kinda exactly what I needed! When tracking includes calories, it really hurts the way I eat. This is great for just remembering to think about it a little without making me feel pressured or guilty or anything."
106,106,5,2020-12-26T14:10:17.000Z,iowaskies,Great app!!,"Quick and easy way to make a food journal-snap a photo and go! This app has been great letting me see when I stay on track with my healthy eating and when I don’t. The percentage reminder of how often I stay on track motivates me to make better food choices. I can set a goal to work towards and it helps me feel successful. I also really like that it has an added layer to let me connect why, where, and how I’m feeling when I eat. It’s also customizable so if I’m feeling something not listed, I can add it to my choices."
107,107,5,2020-12-01T16:43:15.000Z,sporple,Accountability without calorie counting,"The way this app is structured has made it super easy for me to keep myself accountable to my goals while enjoying food and avoiding calorie counting which I know is detrimental to my mental health. Doesn’t shame you when you go off path, and let’s you choose what’s on or off your path for the day which lets me decide ice cream is fine and on path when I’ve been eating salad all week. Love that this app encourages sustainable changes to your diet rather than crash dieting and restrictive eating/exercise regimens."
108,108,5,2020-08-26T02:32:34.000Z,Rubyk14,This is what I’ve been looking for,"I wanted to start keeping track of my food choices, but calorie counting felt so overwhelming that I would give up two days in. This app has been amazingly powerful even though all I’m essentially doing is recording what I eat, why I eat it, and how it makes me feel. It’s quick and easy, so I don’t mind sticking to it. I’ve already lost weight after using it for a week and a half because it’s made me think twice about some of my bad eating habits. I really love this app! It’s so helpful!"
109,109,5,2021-01-13T01:19:15.000Z,Marykatie,Great app and simple!,"I just wanted a simple way to track what I was eating, because that’s the best way for me to be honest with myself! All the other apps I looked into were very complicated and seem to be designed for people who want to make a profession out of tracking their food, and I just wanted a simple log. This app does have a lot of great options, but one of them is the option to just very simply track what you eat and whether it was on trrack for you or off track. Simple and very helpful!"
110,110,5,2017-08-25T08:29:24.000Z,ANGIEL806,I absolutely love it!! :),Ate is a straight to the point app. That focuses on keeping you on track/path and since a picture is worth a thousand words it works.
111,111,5,2018-06-29T14:49:34.000Z,2TwinTowers,It's a Snap with this App,I've been using this app for 3 months and I love it! It's literally a snap of what you're eating pick the path for the food and you're done!
112,112,5,2018-10-18T18:02:09.000Z,Chickeditor,Love it!,"I have done calorie counting & weight watchers. This by far is so much better. No obsession over every calorie, micro managing or guesstimate when you go out to eat. Even if I over do it on a meal I get right back on it with my next meal. I am also visual person  and seeing what I ate over seeing it as a text is so much more impressionable for me."
113,113,5,2019-05-17T19:55:38.000Z,IcedTeaPlease,Ate is great!,"I’m really enjoying this app. I’ve noticed I hold myself more accountable for what I’m eating, especially when it comes to snacks. And I’m getting a better sense of what foods make me feel full and satisfied for longest. It’s nice to recognize how often I’m treating myself as well as when I’m skimping or being lazy. Plus keeping in touch with my friends is an awesome aspect, as some of us live states away from one another. We already enjoy trading recipes and sharing new places to eat, but Ate takes it to whole other level!"
114,114,5,2019-09-19T14:58:48.000Z,Ziasophia,Best food logging app for intuitive eating!,"This app allows you to choose whether you are making the right choices for yourself and your personal goals. All of the questions about the food are editable. I don’t care to count calories or macro nutrients. I do care to track my hunger, and my own feelings before and after I eat. I also care to track the different colors I incorporate into each meal. This app allows for all different choices. It is fully customizable, and even the free version is fully developed. I love this app!!"
115,115,5,2019-08-21T07:37:01.000Z,Jennyfher's Surface Pro 4,Easy to use! Love it.,"Finally a simple food diary app. Other apps are too complicated. Photos are such an easy way to track what you eat (love that photos don’t automatically save to my phone’s camera roll) plus you can write notes underneath & also keep track of how you feel afterwards. You can choose which “steps you will take” to reach your specific goal & the app provides you with tips and a little research for each different “step”, which is something I love. Thank you developers!"
116,116,5,2020-08-05T11:44:44.000Z,Cary Anne Fitzgerald,Empowering the Eaters!,"I am a foodie for sure but as I get older, my body can’t handle the splurges like it used to.  I find through this app, I can feel accountable for what I eat...make my choice in what I am trying to accomplish with diet choices and have a documented review of what works & what does not.  Right now, I am just finding my way back on after time off & it’s so helpful.  I am looking forward to using some of the challenges presented here- like portion control or more mindful eating.  Thanks for the empowerment 💛"
117,117,5,2021-04-09T01:56:58.000Z,AFloodLover,On Task,I learned about the Ate app from my daughter who’s an eating psychology coach. I’ve wanted to rework some of my eating habits and she suggested I give this a try. I’m really loving it and am finding that the act of photographing everything is helping to keep me on task! It’s very easy to use and I love that my daughter and I (she lives across the country from me)can see each other’s meals throughout the day. And love that we can write little comments to each other. I’m very happy to be using Ate to help me stay on track!
118,118,5,2021-01-17T18:26:57.000Z,bri mazzi,WOW!,"As someone who deals with disordered eating, this is EXACTLY what I needed."
119,119,5,2021-01-12T07:01:05.000Z,SpeckleRider,Exactly what I needed,"I am not at all good about being aware of what or how much I eat. This is a very simple, easy to use app that helps me to keep track of what I eat and also helps me remember to eat snacks to keep my metabolism going. I like that it doesn’t ask me to count calories or even have me eat anything specific at all- it’s all up to me to eat what works for me at the time. It also encourages me to eat in a way that I can take a little pride in. I’m sure I’m going to lose weight with it."
120,120,5,2018-03-16T22:21:15.000Z,Elisa.elisa,LOVE design and concept,"I am a huge fan of this app’s design and overall approach to managing a healthy diet. Has helped me to observe and reflect on my food choices without judgement. Not only can I identify snacking or craving periods, it has helped me manage emotional eating through awareness. I can go back and look at my forever history and pinpoint trends to address. One note - very frustrated with app crashes but not sure if due to phone or app itself. Overall recommend to download this and check it out!"
121,121,4,2019-01-14T17:49:46.000Z,PopCultrePropShop,Great app - definitely a breath of fresh air,"I give it 4 stars because I would like to be able to track calories with it a little more efficiently than having to pair with a picture, but that may also be antithetical to the point of the app. So much better and more positive than MFP or other “diet” apps, and would work for so many situations. I would also like to see maybe all the pics of meals side by side for the week to just see overall progress. The pay upgrade was also worth it if you are serious about your health."
122,122,5,2019-05-25T18:54:58.000Z,haileyjohnson,Changed my life for the better,I have never written a review for an app before but I needed to for this one. After only a week of using I have not binged and am on the right track to losing weight. It is extremely easy to use (unlike apps where you have to track every little thing) encouraged me to make healthy decisions and doesn’t make me feel guilty if I eat something bad. 10/10 would recommended I could write a book about how much I love this app
123,123,5,2019-06-12T01:20:52.000Z,Beckiibrownii,Better than expected!,"Heard about this app from Phit and Phat podcast. I was more than surprised by what it offers without the add ons $$. It’s super user friendly, makes you think about your food choices via the questions they ask and only takes the amount of time it takes to take a pic to track. I love it so much that I DID pay for full use and it got even better! I’ve added and removed questions and answers to meet what’s important to me. I just can’t say enough good things 😘"
124,124,5,2021-07-30T00:51:18.000Z,TellzMso,Great Resource for Mindful eating,This app was recommended to me by my nutritionist as I just had Bariatric surgery. I was struggling with mindfulness while eating and this really helps me control how much I’m eating and how often.
125,125,5,2020-08-03T14:43:59.000Z,Erica Drooste,Great app!!!!,"I have struggled with binge-eating for many years and have tried MANY different diet plans, eating apps, etc. But this very simple app has been the only one that has actually worked. You take pictures of every meal/food you eat and answer a few questions after you eat. After a day, you can spot your eating habits. After 1 week, I have already lost 5 pounds....no dieting... just being aware of my eating. I feel so much more happy about my eating and body-image!"
126,126,5,2020-10-09T01:18:15.000Z,SW!8,Great app!,Been using it for nearly two weeks now and it’s a great option to keep yourself accountable for what you’re eating without obsessing over it.
127,127,5,2020-02-06T04:03:23.000Z,ChoklettStarr,I think this is a winner!,I decided to try this app because it’s as simple as taking a picture...  I like that we have a visual reference for what we ate for the day.  I’ve done MyFitnessPal and WeightWatchers and the tediousness Of counting calories had prevented me from being consistent with my food journal.  I am hoping that this will be the winner. I also appreciate the questions that are offered to make me more mindful of when I’m eating is helpful since stress makes me munch more than I should.
128,128,5,2020-01-03T19:53:58.000Z,tap595,Easy and it works,I was looking for something simple to use to track my food each day.  I don’t do points or calories or exchanges but am working on intuitive eating.  This is so easy as I just snap a photo before I eat.  If I forget I can manually add it.  And the questions are really helpful at identifying the reasons I eat.  Now I have a good record to discuss with my dietician using facts - not what I thought or remembered.  This is a great tool for anyone trying to make positive changes in their diet.
129,129,5,2020-06-07T16:31:24.000Z,Sapphire a,Simple yet effective,The minimalistic interface of this app makes it an easy and enjoyable way to track what and when I eat. I feel that this format is more useful than other food diaries I’ve used as it encourages you to really consider the motivations behind the food that you’re eating and to develop a healthy state of mind rather than an attachment to the calories in each meal. I also appreciate that the app’s key features are available to non-premium users!
130,130,5,2018-01-09T01:21:37.000Z,Walkingone417,Easiest food tracking app!,"Forget counting and measuring! You already know what you’re supposed to eat and not supposed to eat. This is the app for you. I love that I can take a picture or write out what I’ve eaten. And, the app takes an extra step to help you understand WHY you ate... stress, cravings, boredom, hunger; while also allowing you to set your goal to be visible every time you open the app. I’m pleased after 1 week of use. I am aiming for intuitive eating not starving on diet after diet."
131,131,5,2018-01-17T20:39:20.000Z,BABblingBeth1111,Mindful eating,"Really this app is about mindful eating... and that’s why I love it. Oh and because it’s a snap to use! I got it because I’d like to lose a few pounds, but more importantly, I wanted to have some accountability/food diary-type method for studying my eating trends. This app is perfect for that. No, it’s not a true weight loss, calorie-counting app. But there are tons of those, and only this one (that I know of) that is really asking the core questions of WHY you’re eating, how, how did it make you feel."
132,132,5,2019-01-05T22:04:42.000Z,algford1234,Awesome customer service and great app,"This app is just what I was looking for to start more mindful eating.  Super customizable and easy to use. The best part of this app, so far, is the customer service. I had some trouble with the subscription service because of the family Apple account and emailed with a question. Tom was incredibly helpful and patient—we emailed all weekend long, and he didn’t refer me to anyone else. Thanks to Tom, I’m enjoying my subscription service :)."
133,133,5,2019-03-29T21:41:52.000Z,TigerAlley,I love this app!!,I really despise counting calories. This app is a great way to help me keep myself visually accountable based on portion control as well through writing notes about how the meal made me feel. Both mentally and physically (and if it gave my any digestive problems). I only wish they would include a special area for water consumption. It would also be extra great if there was a way to log workouts to keep track of days you end up eating more due to intense calorie burn.
134,134,5,2019-04-16T11:56:00.000Z,kartiniar,Easy peasy food journaling,"I’ve tried using other apps to keep track of what I eat, but this is the best by far. No need to figure out the portion size, weight, volume - just take a photo and you’re done, enjoy your food. 20 mins later, the app checks in and asks you to reflect on the meal you just had (prompting you to consider if it was ‘worth it’). And if you forget to take a photo, you can also just write a text description- perfect!"
135,135,5,2021-04-29T05:30:39.000Z,Mmpiotter,Tracking,Love the app to easily track my food patterns. I like that you are responsible for marking if you are on track or off path. It helps you be held accountable for your actions and decisions. It is very simple to use. You can add comments so if you eat something off path you could add a note what was happening how were you feeling when you are it. This helps you figure out some triggers for yourself. Would recommend the app to others.
136,136,5,2020-05-15T16:52:23.000Z,Marinocp,WONDERFUL!,I began using the ‘ate’ app as a way to journal my journey through the elimination diet. It has helped in creating a sense of mindful eating and accountability. I have shared my experience with this app with friends and convinced them to join. We are able to motivate one another through our shared visual journaling of food and open a dialogue of what our relationship with food means and is.
137,137,5,2019-09-20T20:02:37.000Z,Coocoo nut,Great way to visualize your diet,"I love this app! I’ve tried using calorie counters before (like Lifesum) and often forgot to record my meals, and even when I remembered to, it was a hassle to find the exact thing I ate and record the exact amount I ate too. With the “ate” app, you’re able to just snap a photo and record how you feel after a meal (satisfied? Still hungry? Happy?). I love that this app focuses on how you feel. There are also no advertisements... what a plus:)"
138,138,5,2020-01-20T22:00:29.000Z,don't review,Helpful to see what I’m eating,"I have always used LoseIt to track my calories but it wasn’t until I started using ate that I could really see where my calorie intake was coming from. I like looking back over a week to see if I’m loading up on carbs or if I’m doing a better job and eating more fruits and vegetables. I will still keep tracking my calories in the other app but I’m going to use this for keeping a photo journal of my eating. Thank you, ate team!"
139,139,5,2021-08-15T11:22:37.000Z,deeminibee,Great tool!,"I’ve been using this app for over a week. Amazing how it keeps you on point.  Since I’m documenting everything I eat, you have a clear picture of what you are putting in your body every day.  It definitely opens your eyes & motivates you to “stay on path."
140,140,5,2019-01-11T19:52:15.000Z,karsen b,perfect for what I need!!!,"i love the app bc it’s so quick and easy to log your meals, plus it always shows you statistics about the way you’ve been eating... rn i’m 95% on path and I soon hope to be at a hundred. it aldo goves you your meal freauency so you can actually consider how often/how much you eat. the app also gives you a chance to really think about why you ate and how it made you feel which is really nice... 11/10 would recommend!!!"
141,141,5,2019-04-09T18:43:20.000Z,Atexas1212,Love Love Love,"I wanted something easy and straight forward to keep track of my eating habits for my own benefit as well as my doctors. This app (the free version) allows me to do just that, snap a photo, and keep is simple - is it “on path” or “off path” - you can make it more complicated and add other health and exercise components into it with the paid version but for me the beauty of YouAte is in the simplicity and detail of its user interface, very well done! Highly recommend!"
142,142,5,2019-05-04T04:19:22.000Z,NickleC,Perfect for my purposes,"Great app, easy to navigate and use. I needed to track my diet for health reasons and this helps me do that wonderfully. I like that I can just snap a pic of my food and not spend 15 minutes trying to find every item I put into my meals. I don’t care about calories or macros, so this app is perfect for my purposes. I love the positive reinforcements I get for consistently inputting my meals and the data visualizations. It’s helped me tremendously! Thanks for the great app!"
143,143,4,2020-09-28T12:47:20.000Z,anymysha,Incredibly intuitive way to eat mindfully.,Looking at what you’re eating and whether it’s on the right track or not gives me a moment to ask myself WHY.
144,144,5,2021-02-10T21:27:37.000Z,Joann6,This is the app I didn’t know I needed,I thought I needed a fasting tracker app so I downloaded a few to test which would be most intuitive and this app was one of them. Quickly realized it wasn’t so much the fasting tracker but the mindfulness and the photojournaling of my food intake that really clicked for me. It offers ease of use and a judgement-free zone which is exactly what I needed to create a healthier relationship to my eating habits. This app is a game changer for me!
145,145,5,2020-06-21T19:29:39.000Z,ZumbaZoe,Great app!,I had been tracking my food with My Fitness Pal for several years. About 6 months ago I started doing intermittent fasting. I decided I still wanted to track what I ate but wanted to take the emphasis off of calorie counting. I searched the app store and found Ate! This app is perfect! It lets me keep a record of what I eat with an easy photo and gives me the option of creating a healthy behavior to focus on. I highly recommend this app! Thanks to the creators!
146,146,5,2021-04-07T01:13:20.000Z,AltaDoc,Great app for mindful eating!,"I have tried many different solutions for being healthy.  I know what to do but I don’t always stay mindful of portion sizes and types of food.  I love that there is no calorie counting, just being more aware of what I’m eating and drinking.  This is exactly what I need to help me take better care of myself.  I liked it so much, I have 5 friends also doing it with me which keeps me even more accountable. Thanks for a great app!"
147,147,5,2020-12-19T12:59:41.000Z,Rinikin,Awareness,"I am a new user who really enjoys the ease of keeping up with what I eat the “ate” way. Sticking to the journaling for the short time I’ve been using the app has made me more aware of every bite I take, and perhaps more importantly, WHY I eat. I especially appreciate the ability to post later as my schedule is hectic and time for personal time is often at a premium. I look forward to building a healthier diet soon with the help of “ate”."
148,148,5,2020-07-14T23:29:37.000Z,Lexus Rose H,Excellent app,"I love that this app keeps me mindful of my food choices without counting calories or macro nutrients. I can identify my meals as “on path” or “off path,” which helps me avoid associating food I enjoy as good or bad. Overall this app has changed my relationship with food and allowed me to develop a healthy yet accountable way to track my meals. 100% recommend those who need  accountability to make healthy and mindful food choices and avoid going OCD on logging calories."
149,149,5,2020-01-22T17:53:29.000Z,SignSeeker,Easily track any food goal,"Ate can track any food or hydration goal with ease. Trying to eat more veg, or whole foods? Trying to eat less sugar? Trying to lose weight? I love that Ate is so flexible, yet so fast and easy to use. And best of all, it’s 100% positive reinforcement. Really makes me want to keep improving, rather than thinking about my failures. That helps keep me on the path (and avoid going off the rails).  And very reasonably priced for the value to boot."
150,150,5,2018-01-19T18:34:17.000Z,Laura Bartlett,Great app!,I love this app. I’ve tried food logging before but it is such. a. chore. I always end up deleting the app because it’s too much trouble to log what I’m eating. This app has a simple process - snap a picture /make a note that its on or off path. You can add a few more details but that’s all required. You can see what your meal is and how long it’s been since you last ate. All around a great app and I’ve been telling all my friends about it.
151,151,5,2019-03-04T17:07:59.000Z,Sly all day,Great tool.,"I was looking for a food tracking app that didn’t require weight stats, I was not having much luck and then I found Youate! This app is a great tool and provides a user friendly format for keeping track of daily food intake, water, activity and most importantly pre and post hunger/mood. Approaching nutrition with a on path/off path perspective has helped me to really see what it means to eat healthy, dark chocolate shared the fiancé, on path baby! BigThanks to the youate team! Love, Slay all day."
152,152,5,2019-11-07T00:00:37.000Z,Crista726,Accountability,"I’m currently in a weight loss group competition, it’s more for accountability and support of each other in the journey. Every evening I send the daily recap of what I ate to my group. This has made a HUGE difference is my ability to stick with my healthy habits. Something about sharing pictures of what you ate to your friends really keeps you honest to yourself about making the best decisions. I recommend this app to everyone."
153,153,5,2020-07-17T20:07:35.000Z,Kitty and Toby,Love this App,I just started using this App and I’m really loving it.  The photos of the meals makes it so much easier to work with a nutritionist who can just take a quick look to check in on my weekly eating patterns.  I’ve used many Apps where I needed to record every morsel and I’m thoroughly enjoying the ease of this.  I love the notes at the bottom and use them every time I record a meal or snack for my own personal reflection!   Great idea!!!!
154,154,5,2020-07-07T19:10:46.000Z,LittleBird Paper Bell Geometric,The only food tracking app I will ever use again,"You don’t need data about every teaspoon of ingredient in what you eat. More than that, you don’t need the mindset or life experience of collecting that data."
155,155,5,2019-11-05T14:07:54.000Z,happymom91,"Love This App, but it Has a Major Glitch","This app is amazing! For several months it worked great, but then it started showing the wrong date every time I used it. Drives me nuts! I finally deleted it and installed a different app for food tracking. I missed this app, so I installed it again. Today is Tuesday, November 5, but the app says it’s Monday, September 30! What gives?? Is there a way to correct this problem? I really want to use and enjoy this awesome app!"
156,156,5,2020-06-17T15:54:00.000Z,Cmoore1887,Great app,"I never write reviews for apps but I’m seriously loving this one. It’s only been a few days but it’s super easy to use and it’s really helping me. I struggle with restrictive eating and binging. It’s helping me become more aware of my cycles and habits and also seeing that even if I mess up once or twice in a day I’m still doing well. I have less guilt around food. For this reason I love the photo timeline, it’s much more satisfying than a written journal."
157,157,5,2021-01-07T04:02:26.000Z,lexpex14,No calories!!,I love that this app is a way to track what i’m eating and how it makes me feel! i already have a general idea about my calories intake and when food groups i should be focusing on so i don’t need calorie counters like myfitnesspal. i love that you can set goals and make your own path instead of restricting certain foods to feel like you’re making progress. Definitely a great way to get into intuitive eating!
158,158,5,2020-06-19T19:28:19.000Z,zodiacdeb,"Nice and easy, and increases awareness","Ate is keeping me honest. Before I decide to eat something, I consider whether or not I want to ruin my percentage for the day by eating something that’s not on my path. I love that the app keeps track of my daily percentage. I had never thought about that before. It’s nice that you have the option to write in a meal in case you forgot to snap a photo, which I often do when I’m excited about eating! 😄"
159,159,5,2020-01-16T02:22:08.000Z,Mbaaahhh,Great app.  Easy and quick to use!,I really love this app.  I have 2 small children so trying to log food meticulously is nearly impossible to keep up with.  This app makes it quick and easy.  I love that you can see a snapshot of everything you ate for the day and share it with someone for accountability.  The questions you answer about each meal can help you gain insights about your eating habits pretty quickly.
160,160,5,2017-07-18T03:15:06.000Z,Results!!!,Results!!!,"Wow! Using this for 10 days i have been reaffirmed on my healthier habits. In 2 weeks i have lost 5 pounds and found that i even have the motivation and energy to exercise finally! Just half an hour a day combined with ketogenic choices have made the weight come off easily. I eat when I'm hungry, I'm full faster and satisfied. I don't need afternoon naps and i am setting a healthier example for our teenage girls. I will keep this up fir sure!!"
161,161,5,2017-09-17T01:56:55.000Z,whatsonmyplate23,Food freedom.,"I never thought I'd actually find food freedom. Tracking without guilt, no calories, no good or bad, listening to hunger and honoring your cravings. I immediately stopped dieting. I've been dieting my entire adult life and I can officially throw out the books and drop the obsession. Love that I can snap a photo and go on with my life and not think about food anymore. Who wants to go through life counting calories or carbs? Not me. I'm living my life, finally!!"
162,162,5,2018-10-17T20:03:17.000Z,JT5123,Intuitive and useful,"I’ve tried lots of food trackers but have fallen off since they are so time consuming to use with the specific foods for calorie counting. This simplified approach to snap a photo and decide if it’s on or off path is a great visual into what I’m eating, how frequently I’m eating, and whether I’m at my 80/20 goal without a lot of tracking effort. I’m looking forward to seeing what features they add to incentivize the premium upgrade."
163,163,4,2019-03-28T18:44:14.000Z,HealthCoachSarah,Health Coach Sarah,"Love the concept of this app! Super convenient and easy to use. If you forget to add something you can add it later at your convenience. I only wish they gave a free trial for a few weeks. Some things are locked unless you purchase the app. I’m not willing to spend money unless I can see how it all works. Also, I wanted to tell my friends and get other people to check it out but you have to buy it before you can share with you friends too."
164,164,5,2019-05-26T00:44:56.000Z,Smiafed,"Just what I was looking for, but didn’t know it!","I can’t stick with calorie and micronutrient tracking - they are too much work, they bum me out and I’m not sure they even help. I absolutely love this app. I love the on-path/off-path concept and having the photos is fun and lets me know well enough if I’m eating right. Plus I can look back for ideas of on-path things I liked when I can’t think of what to eat. Love this!"
165,165,5,2019-10-22T17:38:12.000Z,Sosamzy,Eating disorder recovery,"For years, I have struggled with eating disorders. Because of that, I am super dubious of any form of food tracking but this app changed my life. It keeps me conscious of not just what I’m eating but when, where and why which are JUST AS important factors as what you’re eating, something other apps don’t take into account. I can’t believe how amazing this app is. I’ve never written a review before, but absolutely had to. I love this app!"
166,166,5,2019-09-27T20:33:18.000Z,Enieyell,Good app,I have use this app for 2 weeks now. While making you more aware of what you are eating it is also helping me keep track of my habits. Example if I’m eating too much or not enough of certain foods. If you forget to take a picture when you eat you can still describe what you ate and what time which is really helpful. I am  anxious to find out how to eat better and lose some weight.
167,167,5,2020-04-17T11:54:16.000Z,AMMAammma,Easy to use! Upgrade isn’t much $$!,"Tracking calories is burdensome and restrictive. Our food choices should come internally, not from external restrictions. But we’re busy—getting in touch with hunger cues and understanding why we eat is so crucial, but hard without accountability (another key feature of Ate!). It’s so easy to use! I upgraded to premium to track my workouts, moods, and liquids. It’s not much/month. Totally worth it!!!"
168,168,5,2019-10-21T00:41:22.000Z,Chessa3,Easy,I like this app because it’s a simple visual way for me to track/remember what I ate throughout the week. I had a severe eating disorder and apps that track calories are a no go for me as they are a trigger still. This is a gentler approach to food monitoring through photo taking. I also like that you can share your data with friends. My husband and I are able to keep each other on track this way.
169,169,4,2021-02-11T00:19:16.000Z,ms_erupt,Very Helpful for Mindful Eating,"Since I stated using this app a few months ago, I have lost over 30 lbs. While I am much more interested in how my blood work looks soon, this app has really helped me change the way I eat in a way that’s sustainable for me."
170,170,5,2018-04-09T18:48:12.000Z,juicycouturelover101,Great way to track food without obsessive over calories!,"I really like this app. It is an easy way to track what you eat without having to input/ research specific calories, grams of fat, carbs, etc. I also love the “on path, off path” feature. I can see when I do unnecessary snacking in the day and try to correct those habits. Also, if you forget to take a picture of your food, you can add text."

172,172,5,2020-08-02T14:02:16.000Z,EETorpedo,The Best,"Food journals notwithstanding this App is the best one that I have ever found. I have tried several ways to track my weight but this one gives you the advantage of keeping track visually everything that you were eating. At a glance, you can see what you’ve consumed and how much, no more guessing. It’s easy to forget what you’ve eaten, with this program that has been a eliminated."
173,173,5,2020-04-28T19:06:37.000Z,wandy3,Love it!!!,I am loving this new way of logging food & nutrition. It allows me to see what I have been eating throughout the day and keep track of my habits. I also appreciate that it asks about why you are eating & how you feel after. It is a great reminder as to why I’m eating. I would highly recommend if you are looking for a new way to log food. It goes great with a mindful or intuitive eating philosophy.
174,174,5,2019-06-20T19:09:58.000Z,Jojo kjr,Love love love this app!!!,"Finally an app that helps me keep in track! I have done weight watchers for years, Paleo, tried Keto etc... this app is exactly what I needed to help me. I wanted to eat a granola bar right after dinner... really really? But I didn’t want to have to take a photo of it so I drank water instead! Thank you! Thank you! I have been doing this for about a week and have lost 3 pounds. It is making me drink more water too."
175,175,5,2020-10-15T16:25:48.000Z,Serialyoyodieter,Well thought out and visually focused app,"I have searched for and tried out a lot of different diet tracking and food journal apps, and this one is by far the best. It is fast and easy to snap a picture of your meals and the UI is simple, but perfect for keeping you on track with your diet & weight loss goals. I also love the social aspect where you can invite your friends and share your food journey."
176,176,5,2020-06-17T18:06:32.000Z,Pmw8,Now this makes sense,I started using the Ate app a week ago and couldn’t be happier. I finally have found a tool that makes a lot of sense to me and it’s something I actually enjoy doing. The visual reminder of what I’m eating is ke for me.
177,177,5,2019-10-28T01:12:39.000Z,STGrein,Great App,"I really like that this app focuses on your food goals and doesn’t obsess on the numbers. Taking a picture of your food forces you to slow down and not grab food without noticing. To kick the app up a notch, I would allow for a personal reminder immediately after the picture is taken such as “take three deep breaths before eating” or “be grateful for this meal” or “I hope you are sitting down “."
178,178,5,2020-12-11T00:36:51.000Z,LMC Designs,Wow. Just...wow!,"I can’t rave enough about this app. The hardest thing about managing my eating is embarking on change. This is so gentle, easy, and fun!"

At the end of the day it gives you an overview of the meals you had. I love that it even reminds me to eat! When you always on the go it helps to be reminded. I like when you forget to take a picture you can just text in what you had. It gives you some accountability. Glad I downloaded it! Great Job app people!!!
180,180,5,2017-07-09T03:13:51.000Z,Unfoolishone,Easier than Writing,This is a great way to keep a food diary without having to write everything down. I love taking a picture it's quick it's easy and it's very accurate. I can even look back and see what I was eating on weeks when I gain weight or lost and it definitely makes more mindful of what I'm eating when I have to take a picture. I would definitely recommend.
181,181,5,2017-08-02T03:18:16.000Z,danielley92,Great app!,"This app is great for tracking eating habits without the complexity of calorie counting. I love the feature to choose for myself if it's on or off path and the ""percentage"" on path. It's very helpful for finding balance in eating instead of thinking of your day as all bad or all good. The app is super easy to use and user friendly, and the team behind the app is very quick to respond to suggestions or issues."
182,182,5,2018-04-19T19:12:33.000Z,aspencer15,Love it!,I’ve only had the app for a couple of days but I already love it. I’ve learned so much in just a short amount of time- like the fact that I am grazing all day long and am often eating just because I’m bored and it’s there. This is definitely making me more aware of what I eat and will hopefully help me make more informed choices. App is very user friendly and I have had no issues.
183,183,5,2020-02-26T02:49:03.000Z,2eTango,Very user friendly,I really enjoy this app very easy to use and plan to use it help me be the new me.

I’ve noticed that I eat a lot while distracted, I eat too close between meals, and I snack a lot. What’s great is that this information is consolidated into a chart for me. There’s an option to track additional info in the paid version, which I’m considering 🤔"

I needed and easy way to keep accountable with my food choices but not be constantly trying to figure out what else I could eat in the day to fit within my calorie budget. Easy to use. Recommend to anyone who knows what to eat - just needs some help keeping accountable to yourself.

This app has brought me back to being more aware of what & when I’m eating and also why; that along with the added accountability has helped me turn things around and I’m headed back to my goal weight. This app is terrific, I’m glad I tried it and have continued to use it."
188,188,5,2019-07-07T00:49:16.000Z,YevrahA,A gentle but effective nudge towards better habits,"This is a great app, with a lot of good features. I’m not generally into this kind of thing, but taking pictures of everything I’ve eaten for a week has given me some interesting insights. And strangely just my unwillingness to take a picture of potato chips is enough to steer me towards going out to the garden to pick a handful of strawberries instead. Highly recommended!"
189,189,5,2021-03-09T14:01:43.000Z,Nickname Trial and Error,A happy app user,"This was exactly what I was looking for! I wanted something that helped me understand my relationship with food and eating, especially emotional eating, while trying to avoid obsessing about food. Anytime I tried calorie counting, it didn’t help me understand why I was eating BUT calorie counting often made me feel guilty or ashamed, which was counter-productive to getting me closer to health."
190,190,4,2018-04-18T15:19:06.000Z,College Student-junior,Love this app,"I really love this app. I used MyFitnessPal for years with success, but I needed a method that was less anxiety inducing. The app simply asks whether what you’re eating is on your chosen “path.” The simplicity of it makes it easy to stick to but is such a great commitment device for eating healthy."
191,191,4,2018-07-21T06:41:33.000Z,AllCorrect,"Simple and easy, very visual and new","I like this app because it’s easy and simple. Also has a function to make a note, like why you eat, where you eat and how you feel about it."
192,192,5,2018-07-21T13:54:52.000Z,greenthumb clogger,So much easier and more effective for me than calorie counting!,"I am a busy mom and have had no success with calorie counting because it’s time consuming and I can’t sustain it for long, but simply snapping a picture is very quick. It’s easy to track everything and makes me pause before I just eat whatever I want whenever I want, so I am actually not grazing anymore."
193,193,5,2019-08-15T17:59:22.000Z,LaneyCoffman,Love it!,"I’ve tried other food tracker apps and this has, by far, been my favorite. I love the ability to take pictures of my food and then put notes on top of the pictures. It’s helpful when looking at my daily recap!"
194,194,5,2019-07-16T21:51:26.000Z,sofbpro,Ate,"So far I am liking this app my friend is following me and I like sending messages to each other.  it helps to see a picture of what I do every day and also helps deter me from eating things I don’t feel good about because I have to post a pic of it, also  nice writing about how I felt about the meal. Sometimes I forget what made me feel tired or crappy now I have a nice diary of that."

With this app I’m finding it’s a great balance for me. I appreciate the questions that follow your meal making you more in tune with the experience. I also like the goals feature to keep in mind for each meal. It’s a gentle tool that is helping me become more healthy and balanced.
196,196,5,2019-12-15T19:19:55.000Z,mjungmia,Wonderful app!,"I love the focus on food journaling to give you insight on daily habits. The app has helped me shift my lifestyle and attitude around food by being more aware of what, but more importantly, why I eat certain things. I would highly recommend it (and have to many of my friends!) to anyone looking for a lifestyle change rather than endless cycles of calorie restriction and guilt."
197,197,5,2019-07-17T01:05:57.000Z,JDiaz1218,Love it so far,"This app has really helped me tackle my emotional eating. I’m training my brain to think about what I’m eating, and as the habit forms, my brain now thinks about what I’m eating BEFORE I eat, leading to better choices. It does not reinforce a “reward” system with food/calories like EVERY other weight loss plan seems to do. It’s been less than two weeks and I’ve lost four pounds almost effortlessly."
198,198,5,2020-09-10T03:54:06.000Z,GrannyGofProvidence,Easy to Use,"I like this app because it is easy to use and does not take a lot of time to fit it into my schedule.  It is simple and keeps me on track for healthy eating!  I tried the Premium version but did not care for it.  I really wanted to like it but I felt it complicated things for an old lady like me.  For some younger, tech savvy  folks it would probably be great!"
199,199,5,2019-09-16T16:49:24.000Z,Fernbush,Love it. Keeps me aware,I love journaling and have been doing it for many years.  This app is allowing me to journal my meals in a visual way. I love the fact that I can recap on a given day and see how well or bad I did and try to do better the next day. I also do intermittent fasting and love that it shows how many hours I have not eaten. Thank you to the team for developing this app. Just what I needed.
200,200,5,2017-08-09T18:34:48.000Z,Friendsfreak4906,LOVE this app!,"This is exactly the type of food app I have been looking for and didn't even know it. The problem with other apps is that they are so focused on calories and ""diet"" mindset. This is perfect because I can just take a picture of my food and really look back and see if I am hitting my goals or not. I can't wait to see what this app brings in the future!"
201,201,5,2017-08-15T19:53:15.000Z,😛✌🏻,So easy to use!,"I recently downloaded this app and it's so simple yet effective when trying to see what you eat in a day. I just wish the app has the option for when you click on your photos you can see the whole thing and not just in a small square. Overall I think this is a fantastic app, will be using it for a while!"
202,202,4,2018-01-03T12:47:11.000Z,Gimphjjnbfc,Be honest with yourself about food!,"I really like this app for the simplicity of tracking with photos or text, and time between meals. The on or off path helps me keep on track or encourages me to get back if I had a slight derailment. The only change I would really like them to make would be to include exercise. This is an important component for me. Currently, I don’t like if I put a text explanation of working out that it resets the countdown clock for eating."
203,203,5,2018-03-22T21:43:32.000Z,BethanyT,So easy!,"I love this app! I enjoy keeping track of what I eat, but always get bogged down in details, so just being able to snap a photo is ideal for me. This is the longest I’ve ever stuck with some sort of food tracking! Knowing that I’m going to take a photo also helps me plan my meals better to make my plate more varied and colorful - I am starting to become proud of everything I eat."
204,204,5,2018-08-08T16:25:48.000Z,KristinB10,Perfect for recalibrating,This is just what I needed for an honest look at what was going in my mouth on a daily basis. I love I don’t have to track calories but can mark things as “on” or “off” track. I was surprised to learn how much less healthfully I was eating than I assumed! Those small off track treats were really adding up. I have recommended this to friends and family!
205,205,5,2018-08-24T20:19:58.000Z,NVnessie,Fun and functional,I had been using another app to track my meals but was feeling overwhelmed and anxious about counting calories and worrying about macros that I didn’t know how to even interpret or adjust w/o a nutritionalist!
206,206,5,2019-05-17T19:49:23.000Z,former disordered eater,Fun alternative to calorie counting,"My husband and I are having fun logging our days and seeing what each other has been up to while we aren’t together. I’ve used my fitness pal in the past but it gets a bit much. This is an easy, and I think more effective way to eat more mindfully and see an overview of how good or bad you’ve been to your body! I love it."
207,207,5,2021-02-06T14:59:08.000Z,Michgal99,New attitude,"I used a calorie counter last year to drop 30 pounds. Yeah! But now that I want to maintain instead of lose, I needed a new motivator. This is perfect for that. It makes me conscious of what I’m eating without having to figure out how many calories are in home prepared foods. The questions and insights from the app are great learning tools and reminders to think about why I’m eating."
208,208,5,2021-01-22T15:55:32.000Z,Newfielife,Love it!,"This app is genius. No one likes counting calories and always ends up being unsuccessful when keeping track of what one eats. This makes it SO much easier. A picture takes a second, not 15 minutes and still worrying if you included everything accurate. It’ll definitely help me with my food patterns."
209,209,5,2020-05-26T22:54:41.000Z,Plant-Based Eats & Treats,Love this app!,"So much better than counting calories, writing in a food journal, etc. Just take a photo before you eat. Record notes if you want and at the end of the day get a recap! A few days worth of recaps and I see where my pitfalls are and where there’s room for improvement. But no shame or guilt! I recommended this app to all my friends. I love it! ❤️"
210,210,5,2018-08-07T12:33:12.000Z,jawjuh,Love the app just 1 wish,Love this app. So much more sustainable to take a photo than to try to track all my macros. I am trying to only eat when hungry too so I love tracking the time between feedings.
211,211,5,2021-04-25T23:31:02.000Z,accountable Amy,This works for me,My husband and I started tracking our food with Ate and found it to be very user friendly.  I am an amateur photographer and have enjoyed taking pictures of my meals. It is also great to be thinking of why I’m eating. The app is great at prompting. I would appreciate being able to keep track of water consumption too.
212,212,5,2020-12-03T00:10:37.000Z,ahalya n,Provides great insight to habits,"I’ve tried calorie counting apps and regular journaling but to have a visual is so helpful. It is easy to use- allowing you to see your portions and timing between meals, letting you determine what is “on track” or “off track”. Simple and versatile. I also love the short questions that provide great insights to your habits. Overall my favorite app!"
213,213,5,2020-11-20T17:26:07.000Z,Flamin' Ace,Phenomenal,I use this app daily to record my food intake. Intuitive design. Beautiful layout. Helpful tutorials. I see no evidence of this platform becoming bogged down with ads in the future. I recommend this app to family members and friends struggling with mindfulness. If given the opportunity I would be an ambassador for this app in a heartbeat. Thank you Piqniq for this wonderful dietary tool! 🥰
214,214,5,2020-08-05T17:35:38.000Z,Alaskan and 64,ATE is working for me,It is easy to log everything I eat. If I miss one I can add it in text. I start every day adding my weight and comments via text. This has kept me focused on my goal which is to have everything I eat nourish my liver or my gut. I’m 88 percent compliant. I love knowing that number. I’ve lost five pounds in 10 days. Easier than I thought possibly.
215,215,5,2020-06-09T20:12:28.000Z,tayaustin3,Amazing!,"I love this app! I’ve been wanting to track my meals without counting calories, and Ate allows me to do that. With Ate, I’m able to visually see how much I’ve eaten, log the reasons why I ate, and describe how I felt after eating. This has really helped me to cut down on mindless snacking. I would 100% recommend this to anyone who wants to track meals without the stress and pressure of counting calories."
216,216,5,2021-01-03T02:26:32.000Z,M. E. Snapdragon,Mindful eating that’s finally easy,I’m using the free version and am honestly pleasantly surprised by this app and what’s available in the free version. I appreciate that the camera portion is available as soon as I open the app (fewer clicks!) and that I can set reminders to actually follow up on how I feel about a meal afterwards. The recaps have also been great to send to my nutritionist.
217,217,5,2020-07-24T17:22:30.000Z,amem04,Great for tracking diabetes,I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and have been using this app to compare my glucose numbers with what I ate.  I also set and alarm for myself for 1 hr after my meal to remind me to test.  This app helps me remember how long until the last time I ate and is very helpful for showing my doctor the sorts of foods I’ve been eating. Its a must for newly diagnosed diabetes patients....
218,218,5,2020-05-19T20:56:00.000Z,mh0528,Easy way to track food,The app is easy to use and convenient.  I like being able to snap a picture of my meal before eating.  Knowing I’m going to have to do that helps me be mindful of the choices I’m making.  But if I make a food choice that isn’t on my path I don’t feel guilty or shamed.  I believe it is teaching how to have a good relationship with food.
219,219,5,2020-01-26T02:02:34.000Z,Interactivebs,Super motivating & easy to use,I don’t have time for long and involved food journals. This app is wonderful accountability with just several pictures a day. It tracks my time between meals and I can see at a glance a collage of what I have eaten that day. More than once I have made a good meal choice because I wanted to continue my “on path” streak! Thanks to the creators of “Ate.”
220,220,4,2017-10-23T14:42:11.000Z,Lobby my,So close!!,"I love the idea of the app and it would be an easy 5 stars If it had the ability to put certain pictures and or meals in a ""favorites"" bank to use again and again. I eat the same thing a lot of the time so this would be such a great feature! Like the same idea that iTrackBites uses you can hold down on a food and it gives you the option to copy it today. lOVe it!!"
221,221,5,2019-02-27T01:09:27.000Z,Best Life Of All Time,Most unique and functional behavior app !,"I’ve used other trackers and get caught in the weeds over their format and detail. What’s essential to me is awareness: what I’m eating, when and why. This app allows me to link my thoughts and feelings to my behavior, which is essential for change! Thank you for helping us revolutionize how we look, think and feel about eating!"
222,222,5,2020-06-05T19:00:09.000Z,Yummy tastes,You measure your own food goals,No matter what dietary plans you have for yourself ATE can give you a visual track of it. Each meal is also analyzed for your mental/emotional responses. This helps remind you of previous healthy favorites and keeps track of why you reach for food items in the first place. ATE is a very versatile app for food tracking. Try it today.
223,223,5,2019-08-25T18:39:34.000Z,LBurgoon,Super Easy,"Super easy to use if you’re just looking to track what you eat without counting calories. I love that I don’t have to search for the specific brand and then figure out the serving size. It’s great for tracking what you eat to be honest with why you’re eating, when you’re eating and how it makes you feel. I’ve learned a lot so far!"
224,224,5,2021-03-09T03:19:13.000Z,Peralak,I always come back,"I’ve had this app for a while now. I always come back because it’s the easiest one out there. It’s not plagued with ads, I can log my food. I’m super lazy about logging food. I use Noom, I’m only able to log my food on Noom because of this app. If I don’t have time I take a pic & log when I get home. Love it, & highly recommend it."
225,225,5,2021-01-18T01:58:20.000Z,Ashc1217,Simple but helpful,"This app is definitely a lot more simple than others that have you log every piece of food you eat. Granted, if your goal is calorie counting, you want to do that. However, this app of helpful in creating good habits around food more than managing your micros. Overall I have found it helpful to keep me on track."
226,226,5,2020-06-20T14:18:58.000Z,KatCamille,Can Do This!,"Keeping a food journal has never worked for me, but I can take a picture of what I am about to eat.  Then I can go back later and fill in the details about what I ate.  Having to take a picture does make me stop and think before I eat.  I am using intermittent fasting so I love that I am given how many hours ago I had my last meal."
227,227,5,2019-10-29T15:24:03.000Z,KatiLady,Helpful & Easy To Use!,"I’ve used other photo based food tracking apps and prefer this one over others. It can be as simple or detailed as you want it to be, super fast to open and snap a picture when you’re in a hurry, and easy to scroll through and see how your day was."
228,228,4,2021-05-31T22:47:25.000Z,ItzMeehChar,"Takes some getting used to, features are all over the place","But I am really liking this app so far. I like the recap collage that is shareable with the notes or your tags (too bad not both on one, but at least it gives you options). Looking forward to working with this more. I’m sure I haven’t figured it all out yet. Maybe a tutorial video would be good."
229,229,4,2021-03-29T03:40:41.000Z,Happy Holladay,Making eating healthy a little easier.,This app was recommended to me by my nutritionist and now I use it with one of my best friends as well. I love two things about it. It makes it easier to determine the amount of time between each meal (I’ve been told to eat a bit more regularly) and a fun way to keep friends accountable for what they eat.
230,230,4,2017-08-13T02:30:17.000Z,Nswy1,Something Different,I think this app is helpful in a very different way from other apps aimed at healthy eating. It helps reduce obsessive counting and monitoring using a few clicks. A picture is worth a load of measures. It gets you thinking in more simple terms about the food and portions you are choosing to eat.  You can look back over a period of time and get a sense if you are on a good path or deviating too much.
231,231,5,2017-11-24T20:15:48.000Z,Osage1980baby,Sooo glad I found this app!,Best diet journaling app ever. So easy to track what you’ve ate with a simple snap of a pic. And even easier way to look back at your day by simply looking at your pics no reading detailed info. So glad I found this I’ll never nutrition journal any other way. I do Tosca Reno’s eat clean diet so this is perfect since I don’t waste my time counting calories.
232,232,4,2018-08-01T18:13:04.000Z,Amandadoesntcare,Perfect app for people who just want to know,"This application is precisely what I needed to quickly see what I’ve been putting in my body, and enables me to reflect on my choices with candor."
233,233,5,2018-10-28T19:13:05.000Z,MalibuJen77,Perfect for helping you eat more mindfully,"I don’t want to calculate calories every time I have a snack, and I don’t want to write a journal entry for every meal. I do want to eat healthier, and keep track of how often I’m reaching for a snack. This helps me do exactly that. Super easy to use and I can feel better habits forming after just one week. Glad I found this app!"
234,234,5,2021-02-10T01:06:13.000Z,nockynick,Delightful,This app is amazing. I love the fact that I’m not counting calories (that is a very undesirable habit).  The app has several different challenges that help be more cognizant of how I feel when I’m eating and what I eat. The ability to see what I eat is so relaxing and motivated me to continue eating better.
235,235,5,2020-03-21T12:28:17.000Z,Bellybarneypoopooh,Love it!,This app has everything I’ve been looking for and I’ve tried them all. So easy to navigate and doesn’t bog me down with numbers like calories and macros. At the end of the day I can see my pictures of all the food ingested and say yay or yikes!  It even automatically tracks fasts and time between meals. I didn’t even have to set that!  Love it.
236,236,5,2019-09-22T20:35:24.000Z,TS9876543210,Wonderful App!,"I’m a working mom, real life and managing everything plus trying to eat right is challenging. The Ate app makes mindful eating fun and as stress free as you can be. I love it! Just by taking photos and making a short reflection, it is such a refreshing way to feel like I’m moving in the right direction. In fact, based on my scale, I am doing just that! Thanks Ate!!"
237,237,5,2021-02-01T00:58:17.000Z,thomastomczak,Great app!,"Very easy to use and a great way to see and analyze what you consume during the day. I became more aware of what and when I eat. I was not trying to lose any weight, but I feel much lighter now. Also love the ability to add people to your group and see what others eat ( picked up a few really awesome snack ideas). Strongly recommend!"
238,238,5,2020-04-01T09:11:07.000Z,amymar13,No stress-beautiful-learning about myself.,"I have used many other apps to track my food none have taught me as much as this one.  Having to take a picture tracks my time, my feelings, where I am, who I’m with etc.  a few days in and super, super helpful.  I’m on the free version. I’m hoping a paid version will graph it for me.  💕"
239,239,4,2020-02-12T03:50:56.000Z,Tessa Monét,Love this app,"The Ate app is extremely practical and useful for users like me who are trying to keep track of their eating habits. I like the lil reminders it gives me and I feel better using it daily. I only wish I could use some of the other privileges without having to pay, that’s my only complaint. It would be nicer if I could have access to some of the options..."
240,240,5,2017-07-03T21:23:18.000Z,Bizeller97,"LOVE, Perfect & Simple APP!",This is perfect for food journaling... I love that you can add notes to each meal too. I have been working on trying to become healthier a bit at a time and this is really really helping me so far. I was writing everything down but it is so much quicker and convenient to use phone and helps to see pictures of my meals.
241,241,4,2017-07-08T03:25:57.000Z,Mimisweb,Simple and helpful,"I had heard for some time that taking a photo of every meal helps you stay on track.  So far, I have found this to be true. There's something about having to stop and look at what you are about to eat that makes it impossible to eat mindlessly. This app meets my needs. If you are looking for a food photo diary app without a lot of unnecessary bells and whistles, this is it."
242,242,5,2017-08-31T15:00:52.000Z,Lalafoilalal,Game changer for gestational diabetes,"I have gestational diabetes and I use this app to make notes on what I've eaten and what my blood sugars were. I love that I can see exactly when my last meal was, how long I've gone in in between meals, overnight fasting, and what I ate all without the hassle of logging calories. I can make notes on exactly what I want to remember about a meal. This app is amazing!"
243,243,5,2018-09-15T23:03:31.000Z,Peg in CO,I was so tired of writing everything out!,"With YouAte, I’ve switched my method from listing every food to photographing every meal and snack. It has been very freeing! I am now more concerned with how and why I’m eating. And when I do get “off track,” YouAte shows me that I can get right back ON track and not ruin my whole day. Simple, meaningful way to begin mindful eating."
244,244,5,2021-06-22T01:20:53.000Z,Julestm,The most amazing app if you struggle with emotional eating,I can’t say how much I love this app. It keeps me encouraged to stay on my healthy eating journey and to keep going when I’m not perfect. I love that I can track social and emotional eating over time and have better self awareness without guilt. Pair this with Food Freedom Forever and it’s the perfect food addict’s recovery course.
245,245,5,2020-10-27T20:13:31.000Z,Angel~Raven,so far so good! just one suggestion,this app has really been helping be accountable and there's none of that toxic calorie counting I've experienced before.
246,246,5,2020-01-03T07:39:47.000Z,Lia Rolin,Must get,"I have tried many other apps like this but all of them shove expensive premium memberships in you face from the beginning, personally I don’t want to spend a lot of money to stay fit so I find it so convenient. On top of that even without premium it still works a charm. Would recommend! ❤️"
247,247,5,2020-07-13T22:21:35.000Z,Dr. Llama,Encourages useful reflection,Sometimes I just want to keep track of what I eat without committing to calorie counting. This app lets me keep track so simply and it helps me to see trends based on my own reflections on what I eat. It’s been surprisingly useful. (I downloaded and deleted the app about a year ago. I’m glad I gave it another try.)
248,248,5,2021-04-14T23:14:15.000Z,Love-Ariel,Tracking without judgment,"I have been waiting for this app for years. Traditional food tracking apps have always triggered really restrictive and disordered eating for me. This app asks only that you log the meal itself, how it made you feel, and whether what you ate is in alignment with your goals. No calorie counting or guilt trips."
249,249,5,2021-04-09T05:01:50.000Z,Terraeileen1993,Gives me mindful eatting without all the fuss of tracking,"I tracked for years and my goals have shifted to make life less complicated. I still have the accountability of writing down everything I eat without so much effort being out into the details, which at this point I just don’t need!"
250,250,5,2017-09-04T01:20:29.000Z,Kaymariecollegestudent,Very easy to use!,"I love this app and how easy it is to use! I don't feel like I waste any time in my day logging my meals like I would if I were tracking calories or macros. This is an excellent way to stay on track with healthy eating! It's helpful that it shows the hours between meals and overnight fasts too. Overall a great app, and free too!"
251,251,5,2018-12-31T01:07:56.000Z,Rexton49783,Loving this,"I can say that in the few days I’ve used the app, I’ve been choosing to make better food choices.  It’s truly made me stop and think about how I’m feeling when I’m eating off path. Or wanting to eat off path.  I’ve come to see how tied my emotions are to my food choices. I would highly recommend this app 🤗❤️"
252,252,5,2019-02-24T04:08:59.000Z,allyyyycatttt,Awesome!,"So far I am truly loving this app! I just got it today but I love the set up! Easy to navigate and esthetically pleasing. It’s so different from the (many) other apps I’ve used! I especially like that it helps the user to be very intentional about the food choices being made and the reasoning to those choices. So far, I’m a fan!"
253,253,5,2020-11-07T02:16:16.000Z,mhxkyxkb,Ate App,"I absolutely love the app. It is simple, quick and easy to navigate through. The ability to see the pictures of the food I eat and see the time line next to it has opened my eyes. As well as answering the questions- they never get old, they only get more real which helps in changing!"
254,254,5,2019-08-31T19:44:46.000Z,catexgirl,"Simple, beautiful and effective.",I love the simplicity of this app. I mainly use it to track that I am eating only when I’m hungry and for this it’s been perfect. There’s so many other cool things about it I love that it asks how my meal was and I can kind of journal I ate too much for it was just right. Builds a great sense of continuity and in achieving your goals. Great job!
255,255,5,2020-11-26T05:06:09.000Z,Txcowgirljp,Just what I needed to create healthy habits,I have been wanting to hold myself more accountable and Ate helps me so much! I love that it is just a photo or text log with no nutritional info.  I also love the questions you can answer. It has helped raise my awareness about my eating habits. I am even thinking of going premium! Thanks for a great app!
256,256,5,2020-07-06T18:58:00.000Z,Little miss repo,"Easy, flexible, and data driven",Better than other apps for recording food because:
257,257,5,2020-05-20T19:44:11.000Z,Madwoman4Christ,Great App!,"I am very pleased with this app. I used to keep a food diary and it is great, however I prefer the visual food journal better. I have a better visualization of my food intake and the app makes me make better choices. I wish that it came with a weight tracking graph as well, it would add more incentive. All in all, it is a wonderful app❤️"
258,258,5,2020-01-21T18:06:51.000Z,pdrmom,EASIEST APP OUT THERE,"I got to a place where I wanted to keep track of what I was eating, but no longer needed to know every single detail about the breakdown. I was so frustrated that every other app seemed to take so long to enter info. I am eating 6 small meals a day, so that just wasn’t going to work long term. I love this app! I think you will too!"
259,259,5,2019-11-26T22:27:39.000Z,Juneau12,Easy and private,"The Ate app is very user-friendly and makes it convenient to track meals.  I like the “how it made you feel” buttons, which allow me to practice mindful eating and be more self aware.  I also appreciate the commitment to privacy, with the option to share info with chosen friends."
260,260,5,2017-07-19T17:31:40.000Z,jtousley,Exactly what I was searching for!,"I love how easy this was to set up. Already logged my first meal in minutes after finding App.  I want to remember meals visually and keep short, concise notes on what I like and don't, and if it matches my plan for a whole food diet lifestyle.  I will repost my review after spending some time using the App!"
261,261,5,2018-01-21T17:44:34.000Z,Dgrucci,Really helps!,I tried similar apps but this one gets it right. I was originally sent on a quest for a visual food journal by the 4 hour body diet.  I end up looking forward to my little self-accountability check-ins. And I get a kick out out of quickly staging shots of what I’m about to eat. It’s making my weight loss efforts more fun and successful.
262,262,5,2018-03-01T12:54:25.000Z,JPBehavior,Love it,"Enjoying using this as a visual food journal. I haven’t found another food journal that doesn’t seem cumbersome. I don’t have time to enter in a million ingredients but by just snapping a pic of my meal I can easy see, portion size, if it was a healthy choice etc. I am definitely more aware of the things I am putting into my body."
263,263,5,2019-01-04T13:24:09.000Z,MKatherineE,Great!,"I wanted to keep a food journal without all the calorie counting and weight management, but let me record how I was feeling when I ate something; this app is just that! If you’re looking for something to help with mindful eating, or to keep track of your emotional eating, or just a general food diary, I highly recommend this one!"
264,264,5,2019-02-28T15:08:54.000Z,Amy Whipps,Mental Health meets Food Tracking,I have been looking for app that will help me be mindful about food while keeping a healthy relationship with food. This app is what I’ve been looking for. You can totally tell the intentionality that went into creating it and how it promotes a healthy mindfulness with food. Thank you creators!!! Brilliant! Absolutely brilliantly!
265,265,5,2019-05-06T17:10:28.000Z,melmargo,The Best,I have been searching for a truly kind and nonjudgmental app for food tracking for years. So far I haven’t gotten any pop up messages urging me to be successful by purchasing products within the app. That was the worst for me in other apps. I look forward to using this moving forward.
266,266,5,2019-06-07T23:11:42.000Z,unknown:):),Great helpful app!!,"This app honestly helped me so much in the way I felt about food and my eating disorder. I was able to see what I was eating and write how I felt about eating it. I’ve realized that while I continued to use the app the less I really needed it, however I do still use it just to keep my attitude up about the foods I am eating :):)"
267,267,5,2020-09-13T18:49:09.000Z,my best life!,Love this app!,I’ve been counting calories on different apps for years and I hate it! This is much easier to track what I eat every day without counting. I also had some family members join and we’re having fun cheering each other on & keeping each other accountable!
268,268,5,2019-06-14T12:57:35.000Z,jpete07,Genius!,"I’ve been looking for an app like this for years! It makes food journaling so easy, but more importantly helps you track why you eat. If you are someone who has been trying to regain a healthy relationship with food, then this app is for you. Thank you for developing the app I always wanted!"
269,269,4,2019-12-10T03:17:04.000Z,waterlove101,Great and easy to use,It’s so easy to use and helps keep you on track to be healthy in a non obsessive way and natural way. I wish that if you ate something off track that it would look scarier lol like with red or something. I love that it calculates fasting time!
270,270,5,2018-07-20T19:44:11.000Z,ShaneGrace,Amazing and perfect for me,"Love the quickness of entry, the notion of simply being on path or off path as a great accountability factor to do better or make better choices before hand since you know you’re going to have to log it."
271,271,5,2018-08-27T17:24:00.000Z,krzygrl06,Perfect Match for Me,I knew that I wanted something to hold me accountable and encourage me to stick to my diet without having to track calories since that wasn't the point. This app has been perfect!! I have caught myself thinking twice in some cases about what I'm about to eat because I know I have to take a picture of it.
272,272,5,2018-10-07T21:46:09.000Z,heatherhauck,Easy to use,This app is so easy to use latterly takes seconds to record your food. Just snap a picture and your done. It also is free we all love free and if you want a little extra use out of it there yearly fee is so reasonable. definitely recommend this app and it lets you share your meals if you need
273,273,4,2019-01-21T03:11:38.000Z,Princegirl19,Loved it until...,Great app for food journaling!  Very helpful for me.  It was working great for 3 weeks and then the data percentages stopped showing up on my profile. I have done everything I can think of and also contacted the developer.  The developer responded quickly and honestly tried to help.  No resolution yet.  It’s a bummer to start over but I will. 🙃 Happy Journaling 😎
274,274,5,2021-01-26T00:37:41.000Z,Tcaporale7,A great way to stay on track...,I have been using the Ate app for a few weeks now. I am enrolled in a Trim Healthy Mama coaching class and this has made my life so much easier! I am able to stay on track with the timing of all my meals.  It’s super easy to use and has truly helped me to successfully stay on plan. Love it!
275,275,5,2021-01-22T03:48:10.000Z,bebekathleen,Super sincere team behind this app,I LOVE Ate! It makes me feel happy and gives me clarity with my eating. The overall design of Ate is organized and fresh. This system will without out a doubt allow you to enjoy eating all while you discover your relationship with eating. I highly recommend.
276,276,5,2021-04-09T22:18:14.000Z,MichelleKudva,Very useful app,"This is so easy to use, it’s fun and so effective. I recently had to change my diet for health reasons to several small meals per day. I am actually enjoying the journey and all the dietary changes I have to make with this app!  It’s completely worth the money, don’t hesitate to get this one."
277,277,5,2019-11-15T20:41:56.000Z,Awesomez!,Food journalizing at its finest!,This is a wonderful app! It allows you to keep track of what you are eating and you can even invite friends and see what they are eating as well. It is very simple to use and an amazing tool to have if you are trying to keep track of your goals!
278,278,5,2019-07-20T02:05:38.000Z,Eat paste,Easy to use,I like being able to just take a picture instead of add every different food in a list which can be tedious sometimes and take up a lot of time as well.  Water tracking is helpful too!  I like the weekly snap shots.   Helps keep me honest with myself.
279,279,5,2019-07-11T11:06:33.000Z,aandreolla,Ridiculously helpful,"It was always so easy for me to plug in numbers on an app and pretend it “fit my diet” or was healthy. But taking a picture of my meals forced me to realize what I was actually putting into my body, and the app makes me truly recognize if it is healthy or not. Definitely eye-opening and very helpful."
280,280,5,2017-07-03T02:29:53.000Z,Keis,Simple & quick,"Easy to use app if you are a visual person, this app will work for you"

My biggest problem is boredom eating, and just making the commitment to record all my meals with this app has held me more accountable and made me more aware. This is a great way for people to track their habits without counting calories."
282,282,5,2018-11-09T12:46:43.000Z,MLSchweit,Just What I Needed,"I wasn’t sure what I was looking for when I went looking for a new food journal.  I’m so happy I stumbled onto this one. YouAte is just what I needed. An easy to use (and share) app for logging what I’m eating for the nutritionist that I’m working with. No weighing, measuring or obsessing about calories and nutrients. No wasting my time converting complex reports into a simplified form for her. This app works very well for both of us."
283,283,5,2019-01-07T18:41:11.000Z,momchap,Exactly what I needed!,What a positive app!!! It is so user friendly and so easy to Personalize. The pictures give me a visual and if I forget a picture or meal - its easy to add it in. I can easily see how my day goes and  why/when I eat. I love that this helps with a lifestyle change and not a diet - and its based on encouragement. 😊 THANK YOU!
284,284,5,2021-04-30T02:08:00.000Z,cake4breakfast,I love this app!!,I love this app!!! Makes it so easy to see if you're on track with your diet! Feature request: would be great to have a monthly calendar where you get a dot if you're on track for 100% of the day!!! That would make this app the perfect accountability companion!!!! 🤩🤩🤩
285,285,5,2021-03-27T00:28:47.000Z,Frydae,Love it,I only wish it would pull out my phone and take the picture since I forget until well into the meal.  After several days I still love this app. The photos help me to remember just what I ate for figuring Macro later. They are also time-stamped which is great for my glucose monitoring.
286,286,5,2021-02-05T04:06:29.000Z,noreeal,Simple & Effective,"I love it! This is an effective, easy-to-use app for anyone who wants to keep track of food without calorie counting."
287,287,4,2021-03-02T12:42:38.000Z,ghamara,Best out there,This is the best app out there for picture logging. I do think there is room for improvement. I wish the camera box was a separate option to bring up. That way you might be able to see more of your day immediately when you open and not have to scroll up.
288,288,5,2020-10-26T12:46:20.000Z,Martamohan,Easy to use,"Easy to use, after a few days easier to remember to take pictures. Love that I can also enter text should I forget a meal. Love the questions, quick, easy and to the point. Would love to track caps. But can always write on notes if wanted"
289,289,5,2019-11-20T18:35:53.000Z,Riley Fuzzle,Easy,"This app is super easy to use.  Plus it is all about where and why I eat; do I cook,eat prepackaged; and what I eat.  No stressful calculating calories.  Plus I can link my journal directly to my Ayurveda counselor.  And...I can take a photo or type in the menu so no taking pictures of my food when I am in public!"
290,290,5,2017-11-13T03:04:15.000Z,Family man99,Great app!,"I wanted to track what I’m eating, but I cook it all from scratch. That means that counting calories takes a really long time - calculating all that is not worth the effort. I wanted a simple log that would still help keep me on track. YouAte is exactly that! Intuitive to use, and the reminders are a nice feature. Thanks!"
291,291,4,2017-12-09T02:58:05.000Z,smwet,Amazing!,I love YouAte! It has made my life so much easier and I feel better about the food I am eating. I’ve lost 8 lbs since I’ve started using youate it’s helping me focus on the quality of food I am eating. I just wish there was an area to log my water. I’m horrible about getting my water in so having a spot that addresses that would help tremendously! Otherwise amazing app!
292,292,5,2021-02-17T21:32:28.000Z,DeniseLou82,It Really Helps!!,"I have tried other food tracking apps, and this is the least judgmental and most helpful app I’ve used! I am 5 days in and am already way more mindful about what I am eating, am becoming more aware of my hunger cues and eating healthier! I would highly recommend this app!!"
293,293,5,2021-01-23T13:13:06.000Z,HelenTinkelson,Great idea!,"This is the closest I’ve found to a mindful eating or intuitive eating tracker. Simple to capture what I ate and simple insight-provoking questions after. A few more tweaks, such as being able to add a question or two of my own and adding the location tracker, and this app is perfect!"
294,294,5,2020-06-13T20:11:47.000Z,nooooooooooooops,Best food tracking up,"I love this app so much. It allows me to track my food quickly, with no judgement and truly reflect to make a difference in my eating. I also love that I can follow friends - it’s so helpful to see what we’re all doing. The best part is the ease of use and the simplicity of logging."
295,295,5,2019-08-23T03:00:46.000Z,Pookster05,This app is the best!,"I love the concept and ease of this app. I have used other apps that were calorie trackers. This one is far superior due to its simplicity and urge towards intuitive eating. I love how it’s basic: on path/off path, and it goes from there. Thanks for helping me stay on track with my weight loss goals."
296,296,4,2019-09-24T16:53:28.000Z,willwalk4wine,Accountability is key!,"I need to lose weight.  I’ve tried “everything.”  I know keeping track of what I eat is key, but I am so, so tired of counting (Points, calories, carbs, macros, etc.).  This app allows me to be accountable to myself just by snapping a picture.  It helps, it really does.  I lost two pounds my first week and am pretty confident this is something I can stick with!"
297,297,5,2021-04-17T05:21:11.000Z,NJoue789,Very Easy to Use!,I don’t write reviews on apps but I love this one. So easy to take a picture. It is helping me develop a healthy relationship with food. Rather than tediously tracking calories all you need is a quick picture and a friend to keep you accountable. 5 stars!
298,298,5,2020-11-14T23:57:50.000Z,Ranakdevi,So much easier!,"I am really enjoying this app. I know that keepingA food journal is absolutely essential for me in order to reach my food goals. However, its been so hard to keep up the habit with the other apps I’ve tried like my fitness pal and weight watchers. Ate makes is so much easier!"
299,299,5,2020-11-13T00:45:18.000Z,Munoz2806,Awesome Awesome App,"I don’t rate apps. However, this one deserves an excellent rating. Just taking a picture, not counting calories or measuring has made me so much more aware of what and why I’m eating. Even the “on track” challenges are an extra incentive. So easy and the little bells and whistles are a nice addition. Thank you!!!"
300,300,5,2019-02-13T19:49:51.000Z,TheReasonsAreRight,This is the one,"This is the app you haven’t tried yet. This app has shame-free accountability, great data and is so quick to use, you can track on the go. The other apps you tried quickly stopped being effective because it’s not this one."
301,301,5,2019-03-04T03:32:34.000Z,momo4671,Love this app!,This app is so great! It has helped me keep track of and stick to my eating plan. I love that it keeps track of how long it has been since you ate last. I also love the fact that I can keep track of what percentage I have been staying on path. I would highly recommend this!!
302,302,5,2019-05-16T14:57:15.000Z,Td4k9,Excellent App!,It’s been an amazing app to help with food tracking and helping you stay aware how often you’re eating. And it helps you stop and ask yourself if you really want the food if you have to chart it lol. It’s so easy to use even if you aren’t super tech savvy. I’ve loved using it so far.
303,303,5,2020-03-05T00:57:55.000Z,RocketGirl3,So Simple!,"A quick and easy way to keep track of meals, mood and circumstances when eating, and water drink intake, plus customizable questions and answers to add to your daily journal. You can keep it super simple, or more complex. I did add the features to track more which works best for me."
304,304,5,2019-10-13T17:51:58.000Z,florenciaescmed,Best app for being mindful without restricting.,"I LOVE this app. As someone who was a calorie counting addiction, I can’t stress it enough how awesome this app is. You get visual cues of your intake and can answer questions about your meals. It’s helped me eat intuitively rather than count every single thing. A great tool for anyone struggling with binge eating too."
305,305,5,2019-07-21T19:08:17.000Z,viviagcrc,So far so good,"The good thing this app provides, is the possibility to track your food without any judgement and calories involve... when you are an emotional eater, you need more of a visual clue of what affects you or how or when you made some choices, to better understand how you can address that."
306,306,5,2020-12-21T00:44:34.000Z,AmyJW22,Brilliant idea for an app,"In a visual and digital world, where people take pictures of their food all the time to showcase a meal, restaurant or their cooking skills, this app is a brilliant way to utilize the technology of today to track one’s eating habits, feelings and patterns. I just got it yesterday, but so far, I’m very impressed."
307,307,5,2020-05-11T20:48:09.000Z,Lia_Horton,Nice app!,"I was looking for an app where I could easily record my meals AND share them within the app with a friend. I am able to do this with Ate! I was kind of hoping I could make a small group (4 people) so that we could all hold each other accountable, but it works well as is."

And it’s even easier than I had imagined with the take a picture feature. So if what you’re looking for is an easy to use food diary, this one is for you!"
309,309,5,2020-11-17T18:03:16.000Z,Creatuvehands,Good way to really watch what I eat.,Having the visual of everything I ate for the day is very helpful. And the time between meals is much more valuable that I thought it would be. I do miss the THM label that used to be available when describing the meals. But it can always be written in the description.
310,310,5,2017-08-12T22:00:06.000Z,Mandy1068,So easy to use!,Exactly what I've been looking for. So easy to track food while busy and on the go. Only recommendations are to create a weigh-in track alongside food track and integrate it with friends so they can comment. Can't wait to see how this product continues to develop.
311,311,5,2017-11-06T05:05:16.000Z,Kmhmjj,No calorie counting!,"This app lets me easily snap a photo, pick if this fits my health goals or not, and helps me see where I need to make changes to get the most nutrition and live a healthier lifestyle. No obsessive calorie counting, stressing about if I can eat this or that while trying to stay under a certain number. I love it!"
312,312,5,2020-06-23T19:03:07.000Z,tictact3,Life changer,This app had helped me to be mindful of what I’m eating. Creating a portfolio each day of what I eat and then sharing it with my friend I’m doing this with has been a game changer.  I’m more aware of what I choose to put into my mouth since I’m accountable to my friend which helps me stick to my goals. Great app!
313,313,4,2020-07-29T20:04:36.000Z,Alpal615,Exactly what I was looking for,I wanted a simple way to be more mindful of my choices. I love having a snapshot of what I’ve eaten for the day and how long I’ve gone between meals. I would like if there were more options with different types of journeys with food you could go on or maybe something like that. Otherwise - I really love the app!

I do wish there was an option to just add a written description of what you ate instead of using a photo. I’m so forgetful with it that I don’t remember until after I ate the food and can’t take a photo of it anymore.

There’s an easy eating system & graphs that shows you where your eating is going. And it’s all about you & your goals. Can’t wait to explore more. Pretty sure by the time I learn it all it’ll be a 5 star rating!!!
324,324,5,2021-06-16T02:34:54.000Z,Lvgapgal,Great way to stay the path!,This app doesn’t judge you. It simply asks you if you are following the path you have created for yourself. It works with any diet or lifestyle. You can even have it remind you to eat at certain intervals! Can I give it more than five stars?
325,325,5,2021-01-28T18:02:41.000Z,Mojo2014w,Visual board,Love the option to capture pics of what I am eating. Love the on path or off path notation (cause we know when we are off path and now can see what we ate) with the after meal feedback! I recommend it to others—I like the time stamp and the daily recap option.
326,326,5,2021-01-27T00:11:22.000Z,Awesome5auce,Great app for keeping track of meals,I decided to try this app because I saw someone else post a pic of a days worth of their food on Instagram using it and I’m so glad I did!

I also like the feature of having one or more “coaches” be able to log in and see what your “food diary”.
330,330,4,2018-01-28T01:30:29.000Z,International Mom2,Easy and efficient,"I have been asked by my doctor and health coach to try and keep track of my meals; this app has a very simple way to keep track of each meal, what time it took place, and whether it met my goals or not. I can enter more information if I choose, but it’s not necessary for record keeping. Sounds perfect!"

333,333,5,2021-01-19T13:50:49.000Z,Macamarillo,Works great with Naturally Slim Program,I’m using this app while following Naturally Slim principles and it works great. I like the ability to take notes and have a history of what I’ve eaten and when. The friend sharing option also helps keep me accountable. Overall great app!
334,334,5,2020-12-12T03:02:27.000Z,dinogal1993,Vital for my eating disorder recovery,"This app allows me to track food in a productive way for recovery. I no longer worry about calories and now track how I feel, why I ate, and other stuff. Really great app! I can also share my week with my dietician to make sure I’m on track."
335,335,5,2019-10-03T18:32:54.000Z,El Gordo 1,Great app,I have really enjoyed this app. My only problem is I often forget to take the photos of my meal. But by being able to see each day has given me a sense of victory over eating to much. This app has helped me to know I can loss to my desired weight.
336,336,4,2020-01-05T21:26:39.000Z,debskinn,Nice app,"So far I’ve only used it to track what I eat (for a week) but it has helped me be more aware of what I eat and why. I have found myself going for some food and then thinking, do I want to add this to my journaling?(which also mean I’ll be adding it to my body), and then I make a better choice because of that."
337,337,5,2020-10-11T22:19:11.000Z,FoodMmm,Easy to use,I love this app because I can quickly see what foods worked for me and then repeat meal plans to keep getting good results. Plus it’s an easy way to keep me honest with myself and not “forget” how much saturated fat may actually be slipping back into my diet.
338,338,5,2020-07-04T21:48:46.000Z,Erinnnnnnnnafannnn,Super loving it!,"Love taking the pics of what I eat and how it records the time for me. I can go into details about how I felt about this meal, or simply indicate whether it was “on path” or “off path.” Also love how you can state what your goals are from the beginning. Thanks for making this app!"
339,339,5,2019-07-09T17:26:30.000Z,THM option - great!,Giving it a whirl!,"I am happy to try this app as a way to track and be mindful of why I eat - is it actual physical hunger, or some emotional reason? I love the “path” idea. One suggestion: consider adding a way to categorize each episode of eating as a “Meal” or “Snack.”  (Would perhaps help user be more aware of snacking tendencies)"
340,340,5,2018-12-04T22:01:18.000Z,Malico89,Just what I needed,I’m trying to get back into tracking and this was exactly what I was looking for - a binary way of seeing how well I’m sticking to my goals (80% on path is my current one).
341,341,5,2019-03-07T18:58:41.000Z,Tabaruk,Easy and keeps you accountable.,My trainer showed me this app and I love it!  Seeing pictures of what you’ve eaten is way more effective than just reading words.  It is really easy to use and I’m very happy with it and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future.
342,342,5,2019-04-06T18:24:43.000Z,SueZQ24,Best Food Journalling App!,We all do our best dieting when we keep track of what goes in our mouths. This is awesome. No counting calories. Keeps track of on plan or off plan and the feelings around eating. This is the way to lose the weight for good. This app is perfectly aligned with PhitNPhat podcasts. It’s the secret!
343,343,5,2019-04-10T01:07:41.000Z,Evergreen04,Just what I was looking for!,This app provides a great way for me to hold myself accountable without the stress of counting calories. It is quick and easy with the ability to connect with others and share your plans with your friends. I’m loving this app!
344,344,5,2021-01-01T23:24:53.000Z,C. Pulaski,Easy to use and informative,"I have used many tracking apps but felt I was always tied to my phone. With ATE I am able to set my own goals, snap a photo, and be done. It’s easy to look back on a day or a week and see where I strayed from my goals."
345,345,5,2021-01-01T22:12:07.000Z,Everspectra,Awesome visual food diary,"Great way to visually document your daily meal journey. It will not assess calories or nutrients per meal, rather provides a simple way to assess patterns regarding where you eat, who you eat with, and how you feel after each meal - al important factors to maintaining your desired nutritional path."
346,346,5,2020-08-15T23:33:18.000Z,Archemeedees,Best food log app ever,"I love how simple and straightforward it is, and it doesn’t make me count calories (which my nutritionist advised me NOT to do). I actually look forward to recording my meals. I also love how it lets me write the reason I’m eating as a reminder, which is to fuel my body, in my case."
347,347,3,2020-05-09T21:38:57.000Z,Denkirkab,Looks great but needs a better method to share,"As with many apps that have a sharing capability, Ate requires the other person to have the app and pay the premium price. I have a food coach of sorts and he works with several people. I can’t make him pick an app. Need to be able to do a simple export report of some sort. So cancelling my premium same day I bought it."
348,348,5,2021-01-26T01:47:18.000Z,Seraphim2u,Great way to bring mindfulness to your eating,"Totally love this app. I feel like I have found a new way to think about what I put in my plate. I find myself thinking about balance, color, and presentation of the food. Plus it’s so easy to just snap a pic and go!"
349,349,5,2020-08-11T18:38:53.000Z,sengelin,A different sort of food tracker,"This app helps with something that other apps have missed... addressing WHY we eat.  It really makes me think about why I’m putting good into my mouth, now, this way, in this place, which lets me correct lifestyle impacts on my diet."
350,350,5,2017-07-03T05:24:16.000Z,Djcnedkf,Yes please and thank you.,"I've tried food logging by writing down everything. Although insightful, it became more laborious and eventually I would stop. This works for me. Typically I'm on the run and I'm not here to count calories but to be completely mindful of what I'm consuming! Love this app!"
351,351,5,2018-01-29T20:48:40.000Z,Radiance13,Great food tracking app,I love this app because I don’t like to always write my food down but I do want to track it. I love being able to take pics of what I eat. It’s also easier to repeat that meal again if I can just see it. I’m a visual person.
352,352,5,2019-04-12T13:21:35.000Z,Hollister D.,Great Meal Photo Tracking App,"For people like me who simply want to be accountable for what we eat and keep track of it visually without having to count calories, this is a great little App. It’s simple and takes very little time to use. I’m pleased with it thus far!"
353,353,5,2021-08-11T01:07:24.000Z,nicknack_86,Love it!,"It’s great to be able to track what I’m eating, why I’m eating it and how it makes me feel without counting calories or macros. Carrying a written food journal just isn’t practical for me so this app is super convenient since I always have my phone."
354,354,5,2021-05-11T22:38:13.000Z,nelsonbrats4,Awesome App!!!,"Not only does it give you a recap of your day, you can choose only pics, include notes, or include your “goals.” I love including my notes, which helps describe things you may not “see” in the photo, such as collagen or veggies added to shakes!!!"
355,355,5,2020-09-04T23:13:58.000Z,Deb1234556778,Started using it today and already love it!!,"I may be biased because I’m an engineer but the grãos has options are totally on point! The app already registers the times and dates of the pictures, and focus on the food experience, not quantities and calories!! I love it already!!"
356,356,5,2020-06-16T17:21:24.000Z,SteveAte,The right path,"After years of using a calorie counting app, I know what I should eat and how many calories I have to work with. The missing piece was identifying why I was eating, and if it was on path of my goal. This app does exactly that, and quickly. Well done!"
357,357,5,2020-05-19T23:28:23.000Z,Jashana,LOVE this!,I’m never going to be someone who cares to track my macros/nutritional details regularly. I have accepted this. So apps that track that don’t work for me.
358,358,5,2019-09-16T13:44:35.000Z,Healthnut wannabe,So easy!,Love this app! So easy to use. The only thing I wish it would do is let me go back to the day before if I remember the next morning that I forgot to put in something I ate. It seems that once the day is passed I can’t change it.
359,359,5,2019-07-29T20:33:34.000Z,Shay848,GREAT app,"I Love this app!! It’s so much easier than counting calories and I’ve already seen a lot better results since using this. It’s simple and easy to use. Plus, the visual presentation of what you eat in a given day really helps put things into perspective."
360,360,5,2018-07-20T21:17:13.000Z,Happy111111111,AMAZING!!!,I swore off food logging forever until I found this little gem!! It truly makes you think about what you put into your mouth and I LOVE that it shows hours fasted and time between meals! I’ve lost 8 pounds in 5 weeks!! Thank you for creating this app!!!
361,361,4,2018-08-03T18:12:43.000Z,R T love,"Simple app, great idea",I really like how simple this app is to use. It’s a great and easy way to keep a food diary for people who don’t want to track calories. I like how I can put in text if i forget to take pictures. I wish I could track exercises in the app as well though. I really like how the app focuses on mindful eating too!
362,362,5,2021-08-14T19:11:04.000Z,Qillith,Fantastic!,I have nothing negative to say about Ate. There are a few things I’d personally change in regards to the layout but that is personal preference. I love this app so much I’m talking my nutritionist into using it as a coach. I would highly recommend!
363,363,5,2020-11-08T23:27:09.000Z,Senkimekia,Perfect solution,"I belong to Phit N Phat and in PnP we do not track calories, you learn to listen to hunger cues and practice mindful eating. I absolutely LOVE that because there are no food restrictions and the lessons you learn and the mindset change is easily sustainable for life. This app blends in PERFECTLY with what we learn and I absolutely love it!"
364,364,5,2020-10-15T20:21:50.000Z,Cooneygal,Glad to have heard of!,Listened to podcast and called mentioned your app.

My nutrition coach Recommed the ATE app to have a visual accountability of food journaling!! So easy  even when your busy  , pictures are with a thousand words !!"
366,366,4,2020-09-30T00:21:09.000Z,Consaheb,Very helpful,"Its good to have an image at the end of the day of what come in your mouth , i just wish that the developer add same path for habits so you can have an overall evaluation of your habits either good or bad . Its good to have something simple like this without any complication just use ur cam record and go ."
367,367,5,2021-08-23T17:01:06.000Z,Future Music Educator,Option of free?,"It is so good. However, I was wondering if there could be a free option where we can take pictures of our food without paying for a subscription? I don’t mind viewing ads"
368,368,5,2019-08-02T18:27:43.000Z,pampered_passenger,No Counting,My daughter and I were looking for a weight reduction program with no counting.  This app is it.  In about ten days I lost two pounds by documenting my food consumption in photos.  It asks questions that are useful and it is helping me identify foods that don’t agree with me too.
369,369,4,2021-01-09T05:16:19.000Z,LauraDanTom,Awesome way to track food,"I love this app! The challenges are great, it’s easy to use and the data is so eye opening. It’s so interesting to see all the patterns. Highly recommend to anyone looking to examine data and change up food habits. Adding an option for snacks AND meals would make this 5 stars!"
370,370,5,2018-06-22T02:01:01.000Z,bunsker,Easy peasy,This is a great for those who don’t want to diet but just need a little motivation to eat the way they know they should. It’s easy to use and it’s no pressure. Just snap a photo of your food or type it in and say if you’re on the path you’ve chosen or not.
371,371,5,2018-09-14T09:42:57.000Z,C.Blizzle,Exactly what I was looking for,Didn’t want to track calories but needed a way to track what I eat. Love the feature to type in what you didn’t get to snap. I think I may try some of the other features I found next.
372,372,5,2018-11-20T01:27:52.000Z,Mariposa16676,Doesn’t Make Me Feel Bad,"This app is great! I’ve tried others and I always end up feeling defeated and sad. Then I just eat more. This app is free of judgement, is visual, and lets me set my own attainable goals. This is exactly what everyone needs to start a healthy lifestyle, not a diet. Love it!"
373,373,5,2019-02-10T15:36:03.000Z,BrownCowDSM,Finally,"This is something I’ve been wanting for a long time. It’s not only beneficial for me, but also for my patients that have to follow strict diets. Everyone has a phone these days, and it’s so simple to just snap a pic right before you eat."
374,374,5,2019-05-09T15:22:25.000Z,Maddy111222,Just what I needed,"Awesome and easy way to track my feelings regarding the food I eat! I think this app will actually help me to achieve my goals versus ones where I only focused on the calorie content in food, not how it was making me and my body feel."
375,375,5,2019-05-10T18:47:22.000Z,EHarmony87,Really Love it,"I found this app through Corrine Crabtree and her PNPTribe! Makes tracking my food so easy, I tell myself at the end of the day to record buuuuut in reality I’m chasing 3 kids around all day and you’re lucky if I can find the darn car keys. This makes it easy and humbling 🙌🏻"
376,376,5,2019-07-14T15:50:52.000Z,elle24!,So good,"This app has truly helped me fall back in love with food and I’m so grateful. Been telling all of my friends who have struggled with food and we are having a great time being aware of what we are consuming. No numbers, no obsessions just healthy choices."
377,377,5,2021-02-05T08:33:05.000Z,anewdays,Simply the best,Easy tracking for the person who wants to be more aware of what and when they eat. Time stamped pics also track frequency of meals and fasting periods. I no longer have to use a separate fasting app. This is very useful!
378,378,5,2020-09-12T20:48:36.000Z,Mmb5326,Just what I wanted,I was looking for an app to support my Intuitive Eating journey. This app answered the call. I was able to customize with my own follow up questions. It makes tracking so easy. Highly recommend.

382,382,5,2019-11-10T18:59:48.000Z,IntuitiveEating!,Food app of my dreams!,"FINALLY - an app that doesn’t overcomplicate my needs. When I record my food, all I want is to record: What I ate, when I ate it, How I FELT when I ate it, and how I felt after. I’ve gone down calorie, macro, portion journeys before — but this is THE APP for intuitive eating."
383,383,5,2021-01-25T18:51:56.000Z,*rAcHiEpOo*,Great way to practice mindful eating and visualize!,I have a hard time practicing eating mindfully and I am more motivated when I can check in before a meal and take a picture to make them more aesthetically pleasing. This app does just that! I really enjoy it!

385,385,5,2019-06-11T13:24:21.000Z,peanut4you,Typical millennial opinion,"Well...it make self awareness fun, in a nonagressive way. Which is a good thing! The app is easy to use and I can see where it would really help people who need to control or monitor what they eat. I am always in a rush, so mindful eating is becoming a necessity. It’s a nice app."
386,386,5,2021-02-08T14:07:09.000Z,Spielberg1,DOWNLOAD IT! YOU WILL LOVE IT!,"Simple, fun visual food journal. Photos don’t live on your phone sucking up memory. When you go ‘off path’ you don’t feel judged.  Behavioral truth: When I write down every dollar I spend, I spend (waste) less money — I bet it’s the same for food."
387,387,5,2021-01-28T02:09:04.000Z,AlexisM.says,This one!,"I’ve tried them all! MFP, macros, well world, etc. but this is the fastest!, most simplistic way to help keep me accountable."

390,390,5,2018-04-16T18:28:51.000Z,Emily_S_Ali,Game-Changer,The YouAte app has been a game-changer for me! When you can actually see what you are eating and take a picture it adds so much accountability! I love it! The support team has also been super helpful and dealt friendly! Nothing bad to say!

I wanted to log foods and practice mindfulness without dealing with calorie counting anxiety and obsession. So user friendly and very helpful in analyzing why I ate certain foods and when. Excellent app!
392,392,5,2019-12-09T00:14:17.000Z,mikemee-x,An interesting concept in a well implemented app,"Having used Lose It for months, I’m interested to see how this app concept compares. Overall the app works well and is mostly easy to use. Excited to see how it goes."

396,396,5,2020-08-02T12:08:47.000Z,Amy-Gale,No more obsession,I was constantly thinking about food. Wanted to eat more intuitively. I have the best luck when eating low carb but sometimes I want pasta. So far it's been nice. Still thinking about food a lot but not quite as bad.
397,397,5,2020-06-30T15:26:13.000Z,Thisismynickname2015,Best Food Journal,"Super easy to keep track of the food you eat, and water intake. Gives a weekly overview as well! I'm training right now and this is the easiest way for my trainer to track what we are eating to help us stay on track!"

400,400,5,2018-03-29T19:32:54.000Z,Moosefairy,So easy to use,This app takes the stress out of tracking what you eat and drink. And with the note box you can be as detailed as you want or just quickly do the check boxes. I really find it helpful.

403,403,5,2019-10-10T17:00:07.000Z,aspiring expat,Simple and easy to stick to,This is much simpler than other apps that make you count calories or points! Just set your goals and then self-rate whether you are “on path” or “off path.” It’s easy to stick to.
404,404,5,2019-08-03T14:18:10.000Z,Duluthwalker,Great app!,I love being able to see exactly what I ate.  I take a before and after pic of my meals so i can really acknowledge not just what I ate but how much I ate.  Striving to leave something on my plate instead of cleaning my plate ‘just because it’s there”.
405,405,5,2021-02-18T23:39:04.000Z,nikki130,The best app for getting healthy.,I love how easy this app is to use and the way it gently encourages you to make good choices. The paid version is absolutely worth it for all the additional customizations once you get the hang of the basics.
406,406,5,2020-06-08T18:35:57.000Z,Maya ff,Life changing!,"This is the first app I’m able to stick to, it was recommended by my nutritionist. Thing is I hate counting calories and this much more about teaching you intuitive approach to eating and happy leaving. Thank you Ate !!  Easy as snap and go!"
407,407,5,2020-02-22T16:36:17.000Z,leslie a johnson,Exactly what I was looking for,As a certified nutritionist that doesn’t believe in the lifestyle of calorie counting. This app is amazing. Only 1 day into using it and I’m loving it more and more. Can’t wait to get my clients using it.
408,408,5,2020-02-12T01:26:10.000Z,avrelu,Great visual of what you eat all day,I was looking for a way to track food that didn’t count calories and came across this app. It’s a great way to see what you ate in a day. I haven’t used the sharing feature yet.

412,412,5,2019-04-16T20:57:10.000Z,Bernard48,Easy to use,It’s a very easy to use and handy journal that takes into account emotional eating. I like having the photo option and seeing the timeline to track being on path.

600,600,5,2018-02-14T20:28:56.000Z,TulsG,Very Easy !!,I love how easy this is to use! It also helps me know how long it's been since I ate last.

611,611,2,2017-10-06T17:12:37.000Z,DramaLlama11,Cant take pics,I really like this app and how I can take pics to record what I eat but can you fix the problem where every time you take a pic instead of saving it the app just closes?
612,612,5,2017-10-10T03:43:22.000Z,Queen Ender,Game changer!,As a holistic Health coach I love this app and recommend it to all of my clients. I’m not a fan of counting calories or weighing your food. But the mindfulness this app creates is perfect.

618,618,2,2021-06-12T19:32:19.000Z,pinky patt,Not intuitive,Need to do usability testing! I can’t get back to a meal photo. Not enough places to make notes. Difficult to impossible to move around. Only works in the one linear way.
619,619,5,2021-07-28T00:19:15.000Z,LisaMichelle90,Good.,Could be better if they add more to it and supply tips and tricks and more aesthetic. But overall very good app.

625,625,5,2019-06-19T18:31:02.000Z,Essenceofclarity1970,Magical Fun Effortless Food Accountability & Weight Loss,"I’ve tried probably at least 15 different food/calorie counting apps so far, and I would give it my very best effort however I’d normally stop counting calories a few weeks into the process/get bored/lose motivation etc. and a lot of the time I’d even start bad habits again and over eat/go off of my plan. This Ap, since you track photos of your food AND you track your mood, why you are eating, with whom you ate, where you ate etc. makes you super aware of your eating habits but not in a time consuming, OCD, monotonous way. It’s super fun taking photos, tracking your situation and makes it so you constantly think twice before going off of your plan. It takes only minutes a day, I absolutely love the summaries of the day/week and how the photos are grouped together. They have nice graphs and info. Very nice having the journaling option with each meal. Actually prefer it doesn’t have the option to count calories in a traditional way, since I’ve given up on that over and over in the past. Love if you’re fasting it shows how long. I am seriously pondering doing the full ap and purchasing a year, since I’ve already lost a few pounds without barely trying! I love tracking my exercise and food together so I’m highly thinking this ap would motivate me to exercise more too! I’ve already recommended this to my Mom and she absolutely loves it too, and is having fun with it and success. I greatly recommend you give it a try, as the free option is a hundred times more helpful than any other “free” ap I’ve ever done. No annoying pop ups or Ads, no pressure purchase full one. The full one is fairly affordable for all you get imo. Amazing thank you, I feel healthier, more empowered to make positive change, and slimmer by the day!"
626,626,5,2021-08-22T01:02:01.000Z,Glue128,I love this app,Amazing app that holds me accountable for my food choices and makes nice daily collages.

705,705,2,2020-07-26T14:02:03.000Z,Deb_MI,Bare Bones App,"I guess if you just want to take pictures of your food on a daily basis, it’s fine. But to actually be useful it needs more... granted, some of this would be available with the paid version, but it seems like pretty basic stuff to be paying for, and I would much prefer an ads vs no ads payment structure. A few ways this could be more useful... being able to add keywords to photos would be extremely useful. For instance, being able to add the keyword “impulse” or “cheat” to a photo and over time be able to pull up all the photos tagged this way would be extremely useful. Likewise, the keyword for a certain type of food could easily bring up a meal that had been forgotten. I suppose it would be possible to achieve this round-about by using the question & answer format they have, if you purchase the premium version with the ability to make your own. Having the water tracking only available in premium is also a huge negative for me as it is so important to healthy eating and weight loss. Also a place to track sleep would be beneficial. I tried adding a photo already on my phone, but it cuts off half the photo, which makes this feature pretty useless. Also, one of the dashboard metrics is about working toward your goal, but there is nowhere to set a goal. I had such high hopes for this app as a comprehensive tool and tracker, just with photos instead of listing out everything I ate, but am super disappointed that it came nowhere close to that. It’s just a glorified photo gallery... certainly no more robust than just keeping a photo log in Google or Instagram."

710,710,5,2017-07-08T19:15:39.000Z,katherine185628,Best food logging app ever,"I've been logging my food for about 2 years now, and this is the best method I've ever used. For over a year, I logged all my calories and macros with apps like my fitness pal, Fitbit, cronometer, and a few others. I never really enjoyed logging food that way. Eventually I realized that I had gained enough intuition about the nutrients of my food that I no longer needed to track macros to reach my goals, but I still wanted to log to keep me mindful of the way I ate. I tried at least 3 other picture logging apps, a written journal where I described my meals, and a photo journal without an app. This is far better than any other thing I tried for a few reasons: 1. It only takes two taps to log a meal. This allows you to actually enjoy your eating rather than try to count every calorie and macro/micro nutrient 2. It is easy to visualize your day of eating 3. The simple reflection options for the meals are helping me to evaluate my eating in a more holistic way, rather than just looking at nutritional content 4. Great for intermittent fasting 5. The interface is very ascetically pleasing and intuitive. I really love the simplicity of on/off path, however, if you've never logged your food before and your goal is weight/fat loss, I'd suggest tracking calories/macros for at least a few days so that you can have a more educated idea of what's on/off path for you."
711,711,5,2017-07-14T16:13:17.000Z,kittrzeb,Just What I Was Looking For,"I used to use the MyPaleoPal app, which became the Happy Body Formula app, until they finally shut it down. For simple food journaling purposes (without the community aspect), this app is awesome. Quick and easy to take a snapshot of a meal, add optional notes, and then check some options about how you feel afterward. I like it that the options are not mutually exclusive (yes, I can feel ""satisfied"" and ""still hungry"" at the same time)."

714,714,5,2020-03-15T23:42:52.000Z,Mom2JBJKH,Highly Recommend!!,"I’m a registered dietitian and stumbled upon Ate by searching the App Store for ‘intuitive eating’. Many people like tracking their food intake but I’ve found (for myself and others I work with) that most of the food/activity apps available are time consuming, tedious, and lead to people overly focusing on calories, carbs, macro percentages, etc. When you’re so consumed by numbers it’s easy to overlook your internal cues, such as hunger/fullness, satisfaction and eating triggers."
715,715,5,2020-12-20T03:57:21.000Z,Anon97394,Loving it for doing what I need!,"I don’t generally take the time to write reviews (I know a lot of people say that, but it’s true). But I really am liking this app and I wanted to share why in case it might help others looking for a way to track what they eat differently than the calorie counting apps."

I really recommend it over something where you count calories because doing all that is a waste of time especially if you’re super precise about it, which I never was, and ended up just estimating which is basically useless for seeing real results."

This app is very visual without all the clutter a lot of other apps have. Sometimes, too much info (especially with anything related to diet/health) can be too overwhelming. For me, when I get overwhelmed, I tend to shut down and say forget it. The app will just go unused and I end up deleting it from my phone."

The problem w poor eating habits typically isn’t lack of knowledge, it’s difficulty in changing habits."

They (Tom specifically) took the time (through multiple backs & forths) via email to explain the program and what it was meant to do (and not to do).  I was evaluating this along with other similar apps.

730,730,4,2017-03-05T00:05:00.000Z,Novagazer,I like this!,"This is a cool app which enables me to record my food intake via pictures and capture some thoughts around those meals. This is so close to perfect for me. It's super easy and fun to use.  No counting calories. It's really more about awareness.  The only drawback I see right now is that there seems to be no way to manually enter a meal or snack after the fact. Also no way to add my own categories on the post-meal questions. So with the ability to customize this more, this would be a slam dunk for me.  Thanks for making this app!"
731,731,4,2017-03-16T03:19:34.000Z,Jennym09,Great app! 1 suggestion,I love the simplicity of this app for tracking food! The fact that it is so easy to use and that I don't have to track calories or look up foods makes this easy to stick with. My only suggestion would be that after logging a food I could go back and change the time. A couple times I thought I logged something but it didn't save so now my gap times/fasting time is off. Otherwise love this simple app for staying on track with eating healthy!
732,732,5,2017-05-05T00:43:13.000Z,JVDingleton,Quick and easy food journaling,Love this app. Easy way to journal your foods if you aren't concerned with calorie counting specifically. The developers have improved the app consistently and now I use it every day :-) you can take a pic or enter via text up to 72 hours after eating (helpful on days I'm crazy busy or when I forget my phone etc) Helps keep me on track and provides data for me so I can make changes or celebrate when needed!
733,733,5,2017-05-22T00:03:43.000Z,a ampm,Great app!!!!!,"This app is very helpful in tracking my food.  Snap a picture, give a few details about your meal and your on your way to consistently. Even if you forget to snap a picture you can still input your meal.  I love that there is no pressure to count calories.  Just eat real, healthy food and you are good to go."
734,734,5,2017-05-22T01:18:54.000Z,avultaggio,So easy for Ideal Protein tracking!,"I love this app, it is no-nonsense, user-friendly.  It makes it super easy for me to journal my meals- snap a pic, and I instantly have what and when I've eaten all day.  I find myself checking to see my meal interval to plan my next meal throughout the day, and my reminders make sure I eat on plan.  Great tool!"
735,735,5,2017-06-01T19:22:55.000Z,Funkygio,Easy to use consistently,It took a couple days of getting used to taking pics of food consistently but now it's almost second nature. The app is fast and simple. Helps me stay accountable to healthy choices. I hope one day they'll figure out how to give approximate nutritional values just from a pic.
736,736,5,2017-06-26T00:33:43.000Z,Sgroom1,"Easy, User-Friendly, Intuitive, and Fast","I don't usually take the time to leave reviews for apps but I feel this app really deserves it. Not only is the app really easy to use with a user-friendly interface and intuitive design, the creators are really easy to reach with questions and suggestions. I received a reply within hours on a Sunday, even when it said they wouldn't reply until Monday. The reply was friendly, professional, and addressed my suggestion. The app has thought of a lot of things that you would like to have in a journaling app, such as why you're eating, where you're eating, and how you feel after eating it. The best part is, these are all optional, or easily added later, if you are pressed for time. I highly recommend this app for those who are looking to find trends in their eating patterns but who don't want to enter each and every ingredient or count calories."

It makes tracking fun and not miserable by counting every single carb you ingest (that's just not for me). I want to work on habits. I do wish this app had an android version, since my phone is android, and I use this on my iPad. But I'll make do somehow ;)"

That’s why I love this app!  It’s so easy to take a picture of what you eat and I’m a visual person anyway.  I also like that it can keeps track of why you eat something and how it makes you feel, youbthen get statistics on the main reasons you eat, etc, etc. very helpful in discovering eating patterns.

761,761,5,2017-07-29T14:41:12.000Z,Nubianblk,"A Handy, Easy Way to Track your Food","7/29/17 Update: It's been almost two months now since I've had the app.  I am raising my rating to a 5 star because 1. I see now how the app helps me to be fully transparent with my eating habbits without any guilt in my recording what I am tracking.  In a very useful way it helps me to honestly confront my behavior and then I can look at how I feel, times of day and make modifications to that behavior with some self descipline.   One thing that I do have challenges with is the apps ability to update my iPad and iPhone with new entries.  I have found there to be a signifcant lag time, sometimes several days without an update of the meals I have recorded on one being shown on the other.  I spoke with the team and they are going to address this wth one of the future updates.  I still believe this is worthy of 5 stars and has proven to be the type of food tracking took that is easy to use and one that I will continue to use.  Oh, by the way my conversation with the tech support people was very plesant and they genuinely seemed interested in my concerns.  That is a big plus as well."
