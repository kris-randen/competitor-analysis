After years of faddy dieting, cutting out essential food groups, even recently dieting through consuming high fat foods (really?!), my partner and I came across this fantastic app. The results? In the last six weeks, we've lost nearly two stone between us and guess what.... you can eat all of your favourite foods! I no longer have an over eating issue and even if I do eat more calories than is recommended for my chosen weight loss schedule (holidays = a few more calories please) you just get back on track after. This clever and free(!) app should be made a legal requirement in my opinion, no food is banned and it's surprising how calories can be hidden; EVERYONE would benefit from knowing what they put in their bodies even if they're simply maintaining a weight. We can't believe that we are lighter than we've been in years, can still eat all the foods we enjoy and the word 'diet' doesn't even enter our vocabulary. This is the basic formula to food peace at last."

The repeat items appear in the recently used so no additional searching is required.
